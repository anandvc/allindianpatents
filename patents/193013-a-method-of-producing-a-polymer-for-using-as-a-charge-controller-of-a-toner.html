The present invention relates to a method of producing a polymer for using as a charge controller of a toner.<br>
Previously an addition of a charge controller for the purpose of controlling electrostatic charge of electrophotographic toner has been employed. As charge controllers chargable negatively among charge controllers previously known there have been known azo dye stuff compounds, salicylic acid-metal complexes and the like.<br>
As improved compounds, such polymer Compounds are<br>
proposed as follows :	<br>
(1)	Copolymer of styrene and sodium salt of vinyl benzensulfonic acid (Japanese Patent KOKAI No.88564/1985).<br>
(2)	Combination of a polymer of perfluoroalkylethyl aery late and copolymer of styrene, methyl acrylate and 2-acrylamide-2-<br><br>
methylpropanesu1fonic acid (Japanese Patent KOKAI No. 230609/1994), (3) Block copolymer of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid (USP4,925.765).<br>
However, by using the polymer compounds disclosed in (l)-(3), as the electrostatic charge of the toner is poor, a lot of charge contoller is required and it is not economical. And it impairs other properties required in toner (low temperature fixing properties, anti-hot offset properties and the like). The charging rate (stirring period using a frictional force when the charge reaches a required charge amount) is also inadequate. Therefore a longer warming-up time of a copying machine is required and a copied image becomes bad in case of continuous copying. The change of charge by humidity is large and environmental stability is inadequate.<br>
Furthermore, as the transparency is poor when toner is formulated, bad influences to the color tone is observed in applying color toner.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an essentially colorless charge controller containing no metal.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a charge controller having excellent properties concerning the electrostatic charge amount, the charging rate and the environmental stability of toner.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide charge controller having no problem concerning the above-mentioned dispersing properties and transparency.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a method of producing a polymer for using as a charge controller of a toner said method comprising polymerizing an ethylenically unsaturated first monomer having an aromatic ring substituted with at least one electron-attractive group selected from the class consisting of a halogen atom, nitro group and cyano group with or without at least one other monomer, and/or an ethylenically unsaturated second monomer having an organic acid group or salt thereof with at least one other monomer to obtain a polymer having a dielectric loss tangent of 0.008 to 0.3 at 100kHz and a water absorbancy of at most 10% by weight, said other monomer being selected from the class consisting of a perfluoroalkyl group-containing monomer, a silicone group-containing monomer, an olefin, a vinyl ether, an aromatic vinyl hydrocarbon (meth)acrylic acid, a (meth) acrylate, a diene, a vinyl ester and a nonomer having nitrile group.<br>
r<br><br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the description hereinafter.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly the above-mentioned objects of the present invention have been attained broadly by the following [l]-[3] aspects of the invention.<br>
[1] k  charge controller for a toner which comprises  a polymer of an ethylenica 1 1 y unsaturated monomer, said polymer having a dielectric loss tangent [tan d]   at 1OOkHz of 0.008 to 0.3 and a water absorbancy of at most 10%  by weight, and selecte from the class consisting of :<br>
(1)	a polymer (Al) of a monomer (1) having an aromatic ring substituted with at least one electron-attractive group (X) selected from the class consisting of a halogen atom, nitro grou and cyano group; and<br>
(2)	a copolymer (A2) of a monomer (2) having an organic acid group or salt thereof, with another monomer.<br>
[2] A toner binder composition, which comprises said charge controller and a toner binder resin.<br>
[3] A toner, which comprises a toner binder resin, a colorant and said charge controller.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to the present invention, a dielectric loss tangent [tan d ] at 100 kHz is measured as following:<br>
A polymer is pulverized into powders of average diamete of not more than 50 ,u  with an  agate mortar, and a test piece<br><br>
is prepared by compression molding in an electrode for dielectric loss tangent-measurement. The test piece is set to an equipment for the measurement with the electrode, and both conductance and capacitance at 100 kHz are measured, followed by measuring its thickness. The dielectric loss tangent is calculated from the conductance, capacitance and thickness thus measured.<br>
A suitable value of dielectric loss tangent is generally in the range of 0.008-0.3, preferably 0.008-0.2, more preferably 0.015-0.1. Polymers having less than 0.008 of dielectric loss tangent may cause insufficiency of charging rate, while polymers having more than 0.3 may result in shortage of the electrostatic charge amount of toner.<br>
According to the present invention, a water absorbancy {%)   is measured as following:<br>
In a same manner as above-mentioned a polynier is pulverized into powders of average diameter not more than 50 u JR with an agate mortar.

Thereafter a weight is measured again and the water absorbancy i%)   is calculated from the percentage of an increase of weight (the difference between the weight of after drying and that of before drying) per the weight of before drying.<br>
Water absorbancy (%)   is generally in the range of at most 10 %  by weight, preferably at most 5%  by weight, more preferably at most 2 % by weight. Polymers having less than 10 %  by weight of water absorbancy nay result in poor environmental stability.<br><br>

■r<br>
polymer (B) without binding to moiety (a) can be contained.<br>

2)	Polymer reaction method of obtaining a copolymer by<br><br>
copolymerizing a compound containing a structure being introduced a group reactive ?ith the copolymer moiety (a), sucli as amino group or hydroxyl group, in the end of the styrenic polymer moiety or polyester moiety (b), with the reactable group in the side chain of the copolymer moiety (a), such as carboxyl group or acid anhydride group. 3) Main chain initiating polymerization method of obtaining graft copolymer by reacting a compound having a structure introducing a polymerization initiating group, such as peroxide group, in the side chain of the styrenic polymer moiety (bl) or polyester moiety (b2). and the monomers composing (a) by which the copolymer raoiety (a) can be introduced ; or by reacting a compound conatining a structure introducing polymerization initiating group in the side chain of (a), with styrene and, if necessary, another copolymerizab le monomer.<br>
The preparation method of (a) is fundamentally the same as the above-mentioned production method of polymer (A). For example, the method of introducing a group reactive with the group located at the end of (b). such as carboxyl group or acid anhydride group, is same as the preparation method of the above-mentioned, and in order to introduce acid anhydride group, (a) is obtained by copolymerizing a monomer having an acid anhydride group in the same way as the preparation method of polymer (A) before the-pQly#«ri zat i on of the monomers composing (a).<br>

A compound having a raetacryloyl group in the end of (b2) can be obtained by reacting methacryloyl isocyanate with the above-mentioned (b2) having hydroxyl group.<br>
Moreover, in preparing (b2), polyol (7) and polycarboxy1ic acid (8) are not necessarily applied for the polycondensation . The aimed polyester moiety (b2) can also be prepared by applying derivatives of (7) (such as lower<br>
monocarboxy 1 i c acid ester, alcoholate) and der i vat ives 444-8	<br>

Polymer is contained, within the toner binder composition and the electrophotographic toner of the invention, in an amount of generally 0.1 -20 %hy  weight, preferably 0.3 - 10 X by weight based on toner.<br>
If the amount of polymer is less than 0.1 %,    the charge in the toner becora small, and if it is more than 20 %,   the environmental stability of the toner becomes worse.<br>
Toner comorise"?. ha.sed on the weigTit of toner,<br><br>
;enerally 0.1-20 %  by weight of the charge controller. 30-95 % )y weight of the toner binder, and 0-15 %  by weight of the ;olorant, and if necessary, less than 60 %  by weight of a lagnetic powder. Suitable magnetic powders include  powders of &gt;trong magnetic metal (such as iron, cobalt, nickel), magnetite, lematite, ferrite and the like, and these magnetic powders have )roperties as a colorant.<br>
In addition, various additives can be contained, for example, a lubricant (such polytetrafluoroethylene, low molecular (feight polyoiefin, fatty acid or metal salt or amide thereof) ind the other charge controllers (such as azo dyestuff containing netal, salicylic acid metal salt).

The charge controller is easily exposed on the surface and the toner is capable of providing sufficient charge even with addition in a small amout of the charge controller, as compared with a charge controller compatibile with toner binder.   _____<br>
Phase or domain of (1) and (2) above-mentioned can be determined by checking the existence of the interface through<br><br>
the observing cut of the toner vrith transmission electro-microscope. For a clear examination of the interface, it is effective to examine the cut of the toner with an electro-microscope after dying the cut with ruthenium tetraoxide, osmium tetraox1de or the 1i ke.<br>
Said domains have particle size of generally 0.01-4 / m, preferably 0.05-2 u ti.   Particles of more than 4 un  cause an insufficient dispersibi1ity and a wider charge distribution, worse transparency in usage of color toner, meanwhile those of less than 0.01 u Jn  do  not form discontinuous domains and compatibility with the binder. Therefore the content of the charge controller on the surface of the toner becomes smaller and the charge becomes insufficient.<br>
