				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a process for managing a<br>
photovoltaic solar module as a function of incident<br>
light, and a photovoltaic solar module. The voltaic<br>
solar module comprises a plurality of individual solar<br>
cells connected together electrically in series, with<br>
at least one solar cell exposed to the same conditions,<br>
which serves as sensor of the instantaneous incident<br>
light on the solar mdule and with a switching device<br>
able to be slaved at least indirectly to the sensor so<br>
as to act on the output electric power of the solar<br>
module.<br>
When using photovoltaic installations exhibiting solar<br>
modules of large dimensions, the variable position of<br>
the sun in the course of the day always gives rise to<br>
partial shadowings of the surfaces equipped with solar<br>
cells, which are caused for example by neighbouring<br>
constructions, antennas, trees, etc. Even when the<br>
surface in shadow is a small area, these passing<br>
shadows may give rise to appreciable losses of power of<br>
the system as a whole consisting of several identical<br>
modules. On the one hand, the input of light is<br>
directly decreased in the region of shadow so that the<br>
relevant module creates less electric power. Moreover,<br>
the solar cells of a module are as a general rule<br>
connected electrically in series. If the current<br>
(variable as a function of incident light) in the<br>
module (or the module part) in shadow decreases, it<br>
also limits at the same time the current of the<br>
neighbouring cells, not in shadow, of the same module.<br>
Furthermore, the current is likewise limited by other<br>
modules connected in series.<br>
To limit these inevitable disturbances, each solar<br>
module or each overall system is divided into a<br>
plurality of partial systems ("networks"). Each of<br>
these is furnished with its own rectifier ("network<br>
rectifier"). For the sake of standardization, these<br>
rectifiers have a minimum power of around 700 watts.<br>
This corresponds to the power created by a photovoltaic<br>
arrangement of around 7 to 8 m2 in size.<br>
In such an arrangement, a photovoltaic voltage which<br>
may reach around 500 to 600 volts is created and<br>
processed with modern electronic equipment and several<br>
modules connected in series, an individual solar cell<br>
having a working voltage of around 0.5 volts.<br>
Consequently, such a network can comprise around<br>
1000 to 1200 individual solar cells. Strong local<br>
shadow on a small number of solar cells (1 to 5% of the<br>
total surface area) may then result in a loss of power<br>
of 75% over the system as a whole.<br>
The general technique which consists in preventing the<br>
current from passing through solar cells in shadow or<br>
those which are damaged, by way of so-called shunt<br>
diodes, so that its decrease cannot act as strongly on<br>
the system as a whole, is known. The shunt diode allows<br>
the flow of a short-circuit current when the internal<br>
resistance of the solar cell exceeds the voltage drop<br>
across the diode.<br>
EP-0 896 737 Bl discloses a photovoltaic solar<br>
arrangement furnished with an integrated disconnection<br>
device which neutralizes the electric power of the<br>
module when it is activated by an external switching<br>
device. This device should moreover not limit the<br>
negative consequences of partial shadows, but render<br>
the relevant solar module inoperative if it has for<br>
example been dismantled in an unauthorized manner.<br>
Manipulations of this disconnection device are possible<br>
only after destruction of the module as a whole.<br>
Solar elements are known {DE-Al-42 08 469) , the solar<br>
cells of which serve as sensors for measuring the<br>
effective solar radiation. The value detected by these<br>
cells can for example be used to depict by means of<br>
display screens the instantaneous solar radiation on<br>
the relevant module.<br>
US-A-4 175 249 discloses an arrangement of photovoltaic<br>
solar cells with integrated control, in which an<br>
independent solar cell additional to a series of<br>
several current-creating identical solar cells is used<br>
merely as incident-light sensor. This solar cell<br>
serving as sensor is exposed to the same conditions of<br>
temperature and of light as the current-creating solar<br>
cells. Its no-load voltage is used as measurement<br>
signal, is amplified and compared with the<br>
instantaneous output voltage of the other cells.<br>
Depending on the result of this comparison, the solar<br>
cells of the arrangement can be connected automatically<br>
in various states of series and parallel connection by<br>
way of relays. On each occasion this should yield the<br>
maximum possible output cnargxng voltage.<br>
The object of the invention is to create a process for<br>
managing a solar module as a function of incident light<br>
and, starting from an arrangement according to Patent<br>
US-A-4 17 5 249 mentioned above, to create a solar<br>
module which is improved from the standpoint of the<br>
effects of a partial shadow.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
the process whose steps consist in:<br>
detecting at least two variable measurement<br>
signals, which depend on the incident light, on at<br>
least two solar cells disposed some distance apart<br>
inside the solar module and defined as detection cells,<br>
evaluating these measurement signals in an<br>
evaluation circuit,<br>
by means of a switching device slaved to the<br>
evaluation circuit, bypassing the external connections<br>
of the solar module in the presence of a discrepancy<br>
between the measurement signals lying above a<br>
predetermined threshold value, and<br>
removing the bypassing of the external connections<br>
when the discrepancy between the measurement signals<br>
lies below the threshold value.<br>
According to one characteristic, electrical output<br>
signals (voltage, current) created directly by the<br>
detection cells are evaluated as measurement signals.<br>
According to another characteristic, temperatures<br>
detected on the detection cells are evaluated as<br>
measurement signals.<br>
The object of the invention is also achieved by virtue<br>
of the device which is characterized in that at least<br>
two solar cells of the solar module, which are disposed<br>
a large distance apart, are provided as sensors whose<br>
measurement signals created as a function of the<br>
instantaneous incident light are conveyed to an<br>
evaluation circuit and are compared, with one another by<br>
the latter, and in that the evaluation circuit connects<br>
by means of the switching device a shunt which bypasses<br>
the series circuit of at least some of the solar cells<br>
of the solar module when a difference which exceeds a<br>
threshold value/ exists between the two measurement<br>
signals.<br>
According to one characteristic, the solar cells<br>
defined as sensors are not integrated into the series<br>
circuit of the other solar cells and are linked only to<br>
the evaluation circuit for the transferring of the<br>
measurement signals.<br>
According to another characteristic, the solar cells<br>
defined as sensors are integrated into the series<br>
circuit of the other solar cells and are linked in<br>
addition to the evaluation circuit for the transferring<br>
of the measurement signals.<br>
Advantageously, the evaluation circuit and the switching circuit are disposed in<br>
the solar module proper.<br>
According to yet another characteristic, there are provided a plurality of solar<br>
detection cells which are associated on each occasion in pairs with a defined part<br>
of the surface of the solar module, and in that for each of these surface parts, a<br>
switching device is provided on each occasion.<br>
Preferably, the switching device is provided so as to separate the series circuit of<br>
the solar cells from at least one of the external connections upon activation by<br>
the evaluation circuit.<br>
Advantageously, the solar cells used as sensors are disposed in proximity to the<br>
edge of the flat solar module.<br>
The switching device adventurously comprises an electromechanical relay. As a<br>
variant, it comprises a semiconductor power switch.<br>
Finally, the evaluation circuit switches the switching device into the quiescent<br>
state again when identical incident light is obtained on the two solar detection<br>
cells.<br>
It is possible to envisage a series circuit of several solar modules comprising at<br>
least one solar module equipped according to the invention.<br>
Starting from the automatic control of power of a solar module as a function of<br>
incident light, already known per se, the invention proposes that a partial<br>
shadow be detected automatically and that a shunt possibly be connected by<br>
comparing the incident light at least........................................................................<br>
two different locations of a flat module, which shunt<br>
makes it possible to prevent the current from entering<br>
the module (or the module part) associated with the<br>
relevant shadow. Thus, in practice the latter is<br>
"extracted from the array of modules" and the current<br>
which flows in the solar cells or additional modules<br>
connected in series and which are not in shadow is no<br>
longer blocked. Consequently, although the electric<br>
power of the disconnected module disappears for the<br>
duration of the shadowing or of the connection of the<br>
shunt, the instantaneous power of the other solar cells<br>
or of the other modules remains available to its full<br>
extent.<br>
The said partial shadowing can be detected directly by<br>
evaluation, for example determination of the difference<br>
between the output voltages or currents of the<br>
detection cells. It is however also possible to use<br>
indirect detection by detecting for example the<br>
temperature differences caused by shadow in the<br>
detection cells and by evaluating them as differential<br>
signal in the evaluation circuit. Optionally, it is<br>
even possible to dispense with separation of the<br>
detection cells in relation to the other solar cells<br>
and to use them also for the creation of current in the<br>
series circuit.<br>
In a development of the invention, for modules which<br>
exhibit a surface of particularly large dimensions, a<br>
multiplicity of solar detection cells is in any event<br>
provided, these cells on each occasion monitoring in<br>
pairs a defined part of the surface of the module and<br>
on each occasion being able to operate the controlled<br>
disconnection of this surface part. This makes it<br>
necessary moreover for appropriate switching devices to<br>
be provided in the module itself or for the output<br>
conductors of each of the surface regions capable of<br>
being separately connected to terminate outside, so<br>
that they can be bypassed there by means of the<br>
switching device.<br>
Preferably, one of the two conductors is completely-<br>
disconnected at the same time as the poles of the<br>
disconnected module, or of the disconnected part of the<br>
module, are bypassed. In this way the voltage which is<br>
still delivered by other modules is prevented from<br>
being applied to the module or the part of module<br>
disconnected and is prevented from possibly<br>
overcharging this module or this part. This separation<br>
may be effected easily by means of a<br>
contactor/inverter.<br>
The switching device can comprise electromechanical or<br>
electronic switching means (relays, slaved<br>
semiconductor switch such as transistors, thyristors)<br>
Moreover, the solar module will comprise an evaluation<br>
circuit, preferably electronic, which brings about the<br>
disconnection operation only within a specified field<br>
of tolerance or above a threshold value defined with<br>
respect to the difference between the detection<br>
signals. These latter may be derived equally well from<br>
the no-load voltage of the solar cells used as sensors<br>
or (if they are not connected in series) from their<br>
current, or else indirectly, as already indicated, from<br>
the instantaneous local temperature in the region of<br>
the detection cells, if this temperature can be<br>
determined by appropriate means.<br>
An important advantage of this configuration of the<br>
solar module resides in that the solar detection cells<br>
may be solar cells of the same structure as those used<br>
for the production of current. Consequently, the solar<br>
modules can also be made as a surface of large<br>
dimensions by the thin-film technique, in addition to<br>
conventional crystalline technology. This has the<br>
advantage of subsequently being able to separate the<br>
individual solar cells from one another by<br>
structuration or splitting of the continuous films<br>
according to the state of the art, and in particular<br>
also of being able to separate the detection cells. It<br>
is only when the electrical connections are laid that<br>
the detection cells need to be treated separately.<br>
Their external connections may possibly have to be laid<br>
in a separate manner from those of the other solar<br>
cells (which have to be connected together in series).<br>
In another embodiment, the detection cells are left in<br>
the series circuit and their effective voltage is<br>
detected by parallel voltage taps. These voltage<br>
signals may serve as input signal for the evaluation<br>
circuit after galvanic decoupling, for example by<br>
optocouplers. Likewise, an additional temperature<br>
sensor could be provided.<br>
It goes without saying that the switching operations<br>
triggered by monitoring the momentary shadow, partial<br>
or local, are provided only in respect of the temporary<br>
disconnection of the solar module, and that therefore<br>
after homogeneous incident light has been re-<br>
established on the solar detection cells which are<br>
relevant on each occasion, this module is automatically<br>
reactivated or hooked up to the array. Darkness<br>
building up or other regular shadows on the entire<br>
surface of the solar module have no effect on the<br>
switching device in its form described here.<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject of the<br>
invention will emerge from the drawing of two exemplary<br>
embodiments and from their description which follows<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
In this drawing:<br>
Figure 1 represents a simplified wiring block diagram<br>
in accordance with a first embodiment of a solar<br>
module, and<br>
Figure 2 represents a similar wiring block diagram of<br>
another embodiment.<br>
In Figure 1, a plurality of solar cells 2 are connected<br>
together in a manner known per se in series in a<br>
photovoltaic solar module 1. The solar module 1 is<br>
moreover equipped with two external connections 3 and 4<br>
to which, when operational, the output voltage of the<br>
arrangement of solar cells is applied or from which the<br>
electric power of the solar module 1 is tapped off. The<br>
shunt diodes already mentioned, which may be associated<br>
with individual solar cells or with groups of solar<br>
cells, have not been represented here for the sake of<br>
simplicity.<br>
In most applications, several of these solar modules 1<br>
are in turn connected together electrically in series<br>
so as thereby to obtain service voltages of several<br>
hundred volts. This implies that all of the current of<br>
the solar modules connected upstream must also pass<br>
through the module represented here. So if only the<br>
latter is in shadow, even partially, or if the incident<br>
light decreases on this module alone, its output power<br>
decreases. Its resistance increases and thus also<br>
blocks the flow of current of the other modules.<br>
According to the invention, the solar module 1 moreover<br>
comprises a first solar cell 5 and a second solar cell<br>
6 which are connected independently of the solar cells<br>
2 and which are defined as detection cells for<br>
detecting the instantaneous incident light. In the<br>
actual embodiment, they are disposed a large distance<br>
apart, for example in proximity to the edge of the<br>
solar module 1. Their external connections, which on<br>
each occasion have been represented instead by a<br>
measurement voltage U5 or U6, are conveyed to an<br>
evaluation circuit 7 which is represented only<br>
symbolically. The latter is provided for the actuation<br>
of a switching device 8 whose manner of operation will<br>
be explained later. The measurement currents I5 and 16<br>
which, in the evaluation circuit 7, may also serve as<br>
measurement of the instantaneous incident light on the<br>
detection cells 5 and 6, have also been represented by<br>
chain-dotted arrows.<br>
The frame drawn around the solar module 1 symbolizes<br>
that with the exception of the external connections 3<br>
and 4, all these components mentioned may be installed<br>
inside a module.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 2, the two detection cells<br>
5 and 6 have been incorporated into a solar module 1'<br>
in the series circuit of the solar cells 2, the<br>
remainder of the configuration being unchanged. Through<br>
(additional) measurement conductors which are again<br>
characterized in pairs by the measurement voltages U5<br>
and U6, the instantaneous output voltage of the two<br>
cells is tapped off at high ohmic value from their two<br>
connections. Obviously, the tapping off of the<br>
measurement voltages should not influence the output of<br>
the detection cells 5 and 6 inside the series circuit.<br>
These measurement voltages are conveyed to the<br>
evaluation circuit according to Figure 1. As compared<br>
with the embodiment described first, this configuration<br>
has the advantage that the detection cells remain<br>
integrated into the production of current of the solar<br>
module 1'. Moreover, the parallel measurement<br>
conductors must be introduced in addition and the<br>
measurement signals must be galvanically decoupled in<br>
an appropriate manner.<br>
In both embodiments, the switching device 8 exhibits a<br>
quiescent state in which it affords a link between the<br>
series circuit of the solar cells 2 and the external<br>
hookup 4 of the solar module 1 or 1'. In this<br>
situation, there is an uninterrupted current path<br>
between the external hookup 3 and the: external hookup 4<br>
by way of the series circuit of solar cells 2. In the<br>
activated state (represented dashed), the switching<br>
device connects a short-circuit between the two<br>
external connections 3 and 4 of the solar module 1/1' .<br>
At the same time, it separates the series circuit of<br>
the solar cells 2 from the output hookup 4. This<br>
ensures that no voltage is applied to the series<br>
circuit from the outside. Although for the sake of<br>
clarity, the switching device 8 has been represented<br>
here in the form of an electromechanical switch<br>
(relay), it is understood that appropriate<br>
semiconductor switches can also be used there.<br>
The evaluation circuit 7 comprises among other things a<br>
comparator circuit of the state of the art, which<br>
detects any discrepancy between the output signals (for<br>
example the voltages U5 - U6 or the currents I5 - I6)<br>
applied to it by the two solar detection cells.<br>
Depending on requirements, it is also furnished with<br>
means of galvanic decoupling of the signals of the<br>
detection cells 5 and 6. It is obvious that in the<br>
arrangement of Figure 2, evaluation of the currents<br>
passing through the two detection cells might not be<br>
able to afford the desired result, because these<br>
currents are necessarily always identical since the<br>
connection is in series.<br>
If the incident light is identical on the entire<br>
surface of the solar module or at least on the two<br>
solar detection cells, their output voltages or<br>
currents are not different or are only negligibly so.<br>
On the other hand, if following local shadowing of the<br>
solar module, one of the solar detection cells is<br>
struck by less light than the other, a marked<br>
difference appears between their output voltages (just<br>
as in the arrangement of Figure 1, between their<br>
currents). This difference is compared with a<br>
predetermined threshold value (possibly located, in an<br>
adjustable manner, in the evaluation circuit). If the<br>
difference exceeds the threshold value, a switching<br>
stage of the evaluation circuit 7 activates the<br>
switching device 8 to its activated state. The current<br>
originating from other modules hooked up upstream or<br>
downstream can then pass unimpeded through the direct<br>
link (shunt) thus established between the two external<br>
connections 3 and 4 of the solar module. Likewise,<br>
unproductive consumption of current in the disconnected<br>
solar module is safely prevented.<br>
If the shadow cast locally on the solar module<br>
disappears (for example because the position of the sun<br>
has changed) or else if the same conditions of incident<br>
light build up on the two solar detection cells, the<br>
difference between the output voltages (or between the<br>
currents, in Figure 1) of the two solar detection cells<br>
decreases and returns to zero. The evaluation circuit 7<br>
detects this situation and restores the switching<br>
device 8 to its quiescent state, possibly with a<br>
certain switching delay (hysteresis). The solar module<br>
1 is again connected and ready to deliver its power.<br>
