				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to ophthalmic lenses. In<br>
particular, the invention provides lenses that are<br>
useful in the correction of presbyopia and astigmatism.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
As an individual ages, the eye is less able to<br>
accommodate, or bend the natural lens, to focus on<br>
objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
condition affects is medically known as presbyopia.<br>
Typically aging patients have varying combinations of<br>
presbyopia, astigmatism, myopia, and hypermetropia, and<br>
fitting these patients with contact lenses presents a<br>
challenge. In particular, correcting the vision of<br>
patients with astigmatism and presbyopia is difficult,<br>
and over the years a number of methods of dealing with<br>
this problem have been suggested.<br>
One known method, is a contact lens that has a<br>
series of alternating spherical optical powers<br>
corresponding to the spherical distance power<br>
prescription, the spherical near power prescription, and<br>
a third spherical power which takes the cylindrical<br>
power into account, but does not use a cylindrical<br>
surface. Another approach to this problem combines a<br>
multifocal toric lens that corrects corneal or<br>
lenticular astigmatism with a correction for presbyopia.<br>
This contact lens has a front surface and an opposite<br>
back surface where one of these two surfaces has<br>
multifocuS annular toric rings with alternating near<br><br>
distance and far distance powers, that corrects<br>
astigmatism.<br>
Although these lenses improve the visual acuity of<br>
an astigmatic presbyope, they suffer from at least one<br>
drawback. Both contact lenses correct for astigmatism<br>
in the near vision as well as the far vision. When near<br>
power is added it adds more power to the distance power.<br>
By adding cylinder power to both distance and near<br>
power, the plus value of the near power is partially<br>
negated by an extra minus cylinder power. Therefore, a<br>
need exists for a contact lens which may be used by<br>
astigmatic presbyopes which corrects the astigmatism in<br>
their distance vision without unnecessarily correcting<br>
the astigmatism in their near vision. It is this need<br>
that the lenses of this invention meet.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an ophthalmic lens suitable<br>
for correcting the vision of astigmatic presbyopes.<br>
Particularly, the invention comprises, consists<br>
essentially of, and consists of an ophthalmic lens<br>
comprising a convex surface and a concave surface<br>
wherein<br><br>
one of said surfaces comprises a center zone<br>
having distance spherical and cylinder optical<br>
power<br>
and<br>
at least one concentric annular ring having<br>
optical power selected from one member of the<br>
group consisting of<br>
(a)	a distance spherical and cylinder<br>
optical power,<br>
(b)	a near optical power, and<br>
(c)	a distance spherical optical power.<br>
As used herein, "ophthalmic lens" refers to contact<br>
lenses and intraocular lenses, or the like, where the<br>
preferred lens is a contact lens, more preferably a soft<br>
contact lens made of hydrogel such as etafilcon A.<br>
These lenses and material are known in the art.<br>
Illustrative examples of these materials may be found in.<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,681,114, 5,809,260, 5,898,473,<br>
5,864,379, 5,812,236 which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference with respect to the hydrogel formulations<br>
contained therein.<br>
The phrases "concave surface" and "convex surface<br>
refer to the back ancT front surface, respectively of the<br>
lens. "Others have referred to the concave surface as<br>
the back curve and the convex surface as the front curve<br>
and the authors intend that meaning for these terms.<br>
One surface of the ophthalmic lenses of this invention<br>
contains a central zone and at least one annular ring.<br>
It is preferred that the surface having said zone and<br>
annular ring is the concave surface. The other surface<br>
of the opthalmic lens contains a conventional spherical<br>
or aspherical optic zone, surrounded by peripheral<br>
annuli to control the fit or a conventional spherical or<br>
aspherical optic zone having a certain thickness to<br><br>
control the fit. It is preferred that the other surface<br>
is the convex surface having a certain thickness to<br>
control the fit.<br>
The phrase "center zone" refers to the portion that<br>
is the center of the ophthalmic lens.. " Concentric<br>
annular ring," refers to a ring that surrounds the<br>
center zone. The phrase "distance spherical and<br>
cylinder optical power" refer to the amount of<br>
refractive power required to correct the wearer's<br>
distance visual acuity to the desired degree where said<br>
power has a spherical and cylinder components. The term<br>
"near optical power" refers to the amountof refractive<br>
power required to correct the wearer's near visual<br>
acuity to the desired degree but does not include a<br>
cylinder component. The terms "distance spherical<br>
optical power" refer to the amount of refractive power<br>
required to correct the wearer's distance visual acuity<br>
to the desired degree where said power has a spherical<br>
component, but which does not include a cylinder<br>
component. It is preferred that the at least one<br>
concentric annular ring have near optical power.<br>
Although it is required that the lenses of the<br>
invention have at least one concentric annular ring, the<br>
lenses may have about 4 to 20 concentric annual rings.<br>
The preferred number of annular rings is about 4 to 7.<br>
It is also preferred that the annular rings alternate in<br>
their optical power-rings of near optical power are<br>
acljacent to rings of distance optical power. For<br>
example if a lens of the invention has a center zone and<br>
two annular rings, the center zone will have distance<br>
spherical and cylinder optical power, the first annular<br>
ring, adjacent to and concentric with the center zone,<br>
will have near power, and the second annular ring,<br>
adjacent to and concentric with the first annular ring<br><br>
will have distance spherical and cylinder optical power.<br>
Not all rings of distance optical power rings need have<br>
cylinder power, and it is preferred that at least about<br>
three (3) of said distance rings have cylinder power.<br>
Contrary to the distance optical power rings, all<br>
near optical power rings have spherical power, only.<br>
Although astigmatism usually affects the near vision as<br>
well as the far vision, tests have shown, that<br>
astigmatism need not be corrected in both near and far<br>
vision to adequately correct a person's vision. Even<br>
without correcting astigmatism in their near vision,<br>
patients can often perform their routine tasks, such as<br>
reading print that is the size of newspaper print.<br>
Additionally, in some patients, the extra cylindrical<br>
power in the near zone is deleterious to their vision.<br>
The size of the rings and center zone are related<br>
to the pupil size of the patient. This relationship is<br>
known in the art and is described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,929,969, which is hereby incorporated by reference<br>
herein in its entirety.<br>
In addition, the invention comprises, consists<br>
essentially of, and consists of an ophthalmic lens<br>
comprising a convex surface and a concave surface<br>
wherein<br>
one of said surfaces comprises a center zone<br>
having near optical power<br>
and<br>
at least one concentric annular ring having a<br>
distance spherical and cylinder optical power.<br>
As used herein the phrases "ophthalmic lens," "concave<br>
surface," "convex surface," "center zone," "concentric<br>
annular ring," "distance spherical and cylinder optical<br>
power," "near optical power," and "distance spherical<br><br>
power" all have their aforementioned meanings and<br>
preferred ranges.<br>
Still further, the invention comprises, consists<br>
essentially of, and consists of an ophthalmic lens<br>
comprising a convex surface and a concave surface<br>
wherein<br>
one of said surfaces comprises a center zone<br>
having distance spherical optical power<br>
and<br>
at: least one concentric annular ring having<br>
distance spherical and cylinder optical power.<br>
As used herein the phrases "ophthalmic lens," "concave<br>
surface," "convex surface," "center zone," "concentric<br>
annular ring," "distance spherical and cylinder optical<br>
power," "near optical power," and "distance spherical<br>
power" all have their aforementioned meanings and<br>
preferred ranges.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate an embodiment of the<br>
invention where three of the distance annular rings have<br>
spherical power and cylinder power. Figures 1 and 2 are<br>
respectively back plan and side views of lens 10 of the<br>
invention. The concave surface, 16 is on the opposite<br>
side of the convex surface 17. Surface 16 has a central<br>
zone, H, that has distance spherical and cylinder<br>
optical power. The first concentric annular ring, 12,<br>
has near optical power. The third and fifth concentric<br>
annular rings, 13 and 15, respectively have distance<br>
spherical and cylinder optical power. The fourth<br>
concentric annular ring, 14, has near optical power.<br>
Surface 17 is a conventional spherical or aspherical<br>
optic zone, having a thickness sufficient to control the<br>
fit of the lens to the eye.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is contains<br>
distance spherical and cylinder power in the center zone<br><br>
alone, and is illustrated by figures 3 and 4. Those<br>
figures illustrate the back plan and side view of lens<br>

the convex surface 31. Surface 30. has a center zone,<br>
32, having distance spherical and cylinder optical<br>
power. The first concentric annular ring, 33, has near<br>
optical power. The second and the fourth concentric<br>
annular rings, 34 and 36 respectively, have distance<br>
spherical optical power. The fourth concentric annular<br>
ring, 35, has near optical power. Surface 21. is a<br>
conventional spherical or aspherical optic zone, having<br>
a thickness sufficient to control the fit.<br>
The lenses of the invention may be formed by any<br>
conventional method, for example as disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,861,114, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety. For example, the annular-<br>
zones of the lenses of the invention, may be produced by<br>
diamond-turning using alternating radii. The zones may<br>
be diamond-turned into the molds that are used to form<br>
the lens of the invention. Subsequently, a suitable<br>
liquid resin is placed between the molds followed by<br>
compression and curing of the resin to form the lenses<br>
of the invention. Alternatively, the zones may be<br>
diamond-turned from lens buttons.<br>
