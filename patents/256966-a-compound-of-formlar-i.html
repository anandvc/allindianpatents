				<td>The present invention is concerned with novel aryl piperidine or piperazine compounds substituted with certain 5-membered heterocycles having apoB secretion/MTP inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. The invention further relates to methods for preparing such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds as well as the use of said compounds as a medicine for the treatment of atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and type n diabetes.<br>
Obesity is the cause of a myriad of serious health problems like the adult onset of diabetes and heart disease. In addition, losing weight is getting an obsession among an increasing proportion of the human population.<br>
The causal relationship between hypercholesterolemia, particularly that associated with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as LDL) and very low density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as VLDL), and premature atherosclerosis and/or cardiovascular disease is now widely recognized. However, a limited number of drugs are presently available for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.<br>
Drugs primarily used for the management of hyperlipidemia include bile acid sequestrant resins such as cholestyramine and colestipol, fibric acid derivatives such as bezafibrate, clofibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate and gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as HMG Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitors. There still remains a need for new lipid lowering agents with improved efficiency and/or acting via other mechanisms than the above mentioned drugs.<br>
Plasma lipoproteins are water-soluble complexes of high molecular weight formed from lipids (cholesterol, triglyceride, phospholipids) and apolipoproteins. Five major classes of lipoproteins that differ in the proportion of lipids and the type of apolipoprotein, all having their origin in the liver and/or the intestine, have been defined according to their density (as measured by ultracentrifugation). They include LDL, VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as IDL), high density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL) and chylomicrons. Ten major human plasma apolipoproteins have been identified. VLDL, which is secreted by the liver and contains apolipoprotein B (hereinafter referred as Apo-B), undergoes degradation to <br>
LDL which transports 60 to 70% of the total serum cholesterol. Apo-B is also the main protein component of LDL. Increased LDL-cholesterol in serum, due to oversynthesis or decreased metabolism, is causally related to atherosclerosis. In contrast high density lipoproteins (hereinafter referred as HDL), which contain apolipoprotein Al, have a protective effect and are inversely correlated with the risk of coronary heart disease. The HDL/LDL ratio is thus a convenient method of assessing the atherogenic potential of an individual's plasma lipid profile.<br>
The two isoforms of apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo B-48 and apo B-100, are important proteins in human lipoprotein metabolism. Apo B-48, is about 48% the size of apo B-100 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, is synthesized by the intestine in humans. Apo B-48 is necessary for the assembly of chylomicrons and therefore has an obligatory role in the intestinal absorption of dietary fats. Apo B-100, which is produced in the liver in humans, is required for the synthesis and secretion of VLDL. LDL, which contain about 2/3 of the cholesterol in human plasma, are metabolic products of VLDL. Apo B-100 is virtually the only protein component of LDL. Elevated concentrations of apo B-100 and LDL cholesterol in plasma are recognized risk factors for developing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.<br>
A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperlipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia Primary hyperlipidemias have also been classified into common hypercholesterolaemia, familial combined hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant hyperlipidaemia, chylomicronaemia syndrome and familial hypertriglyceridaemia.<br>
Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (hereinafter referred as MTP) is known to catalyze the transport of triglyceride and cholesteryl ester by preference to phospholipids such as phosphatidylchoUne. It was demonstrated by D.Sharp et al., Nature (1993) 365:65 that the defect causing abetalipoproteinemia is hi the MTP gene. This indicates that MTP is required for the synthesis of Apo B-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, the precursor to LDL. It therefore follows that an MTP inhibitor would inhibit the synthesis of VLDL and LDL, thereby lowering levels of VLDL, LDL, cholesterol and triglyceride in humans.<br>
MTP inhibitors have been disclosed in WO-00/32582, WO-01/96327 and WO-02/20501.<br><br>
The present invention is based on the unexpected discovery that a group of novel aryl piperidine or piperazine compounds substituted with certain 5-membered heterocycles have apoB secretion/MTP inhibiting activity. These compounds of formula (I) can act systemically and/or as as selective MTP inhibitors, i.e. is able to selectively block MTP at the level of the gut wall in mammals.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. Those compounds of formula (I) that are obtained in racemic form may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid.

The compounds of formula (I), the JV-oxide forms, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomeric forms thereof possess favourable apoB secretion and MTP inhibiting activity and concomitant lipid lowering activity. Therefore the present compounds of formula (I) are useful as a medicine especially in a method of treating patients suffering from hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type n diabetes.<br>
Subsequently the present compounds may be used for the manufacture of a medicine for treating disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol associated with said VLDL and LDL. In particular the present compounds may be used for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type n diabetes.<br>
The principal mechanism of action of the compounds of formula (I) appears to involve inhibition of MTP (microsomial triglyceride transfer protein) activity in hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in decreased VLDL and chylomicron production, respectively. This is a novel and innovative approach to hyperlipidemia, and is expected to lower LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides through reduced hepatic production of VLDL and intestinal production of chylomicrons.<br>
A large number of genetic and acquired diseases can result in hyperlipidemia. They can be classified into primary and secondary hyperlipidemic states. The most common causes of the secondary hyperlipidemias are diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse, drugs, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, cholestasis and bulimia. Primary hyperlipidemias are common hypercholesterolaemia, familial combined hyperlipidaemia, familial hypercholesterolaemia, remnant hyperlipidaemia, chylo-micronaemia syndrome, familial hypertriglyceridaemia. The present compounds may also be used to prevent or treat patients suffering from obesitas or from atherosclerosis, especially coronary atherosclerosis and more in general disorders which are related to atherosclerosis, such as ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular disease. The present compounds may cause regression of atherosclerosis and inhibit the clinical consequences of atherosclerosis, particularly morbidity and mortality.<br>
In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (3), it follows that the present invention also provides a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, (generally called herein patients) suffering from disorders caused by an excess of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low density lipoproteins (LDL), and especially disorders caused by the cholesterol associated with said VLDL and LDL. Consequently a method of treatment is provided for relieving patients suffering from conditions, such as, for example, hyperlipidemia, obesity, atherosclerosis or type n diabetes.<br>

Additionally the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br>
La order to prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, in base or acid addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for oral administration, rectal administration, percutaneous administration or parenteral injection.<br>
For example in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual liquid pharmaceutical carriers may be employed, such as for instance water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid pharmaceutical carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their easy administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral injection compositions, the pharmaceutical carrier will mainly comprise sterile water, although other ingredients may be included in order to improve solubility of the active ingredient. Injectable solutions may be prepared for instance by using a pharmaceutical carrier comprising a saline solution, a glucose solution or a mixture of both. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared by using appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like. In compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the pharmaceutical carrier may optionally comprise a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with minor proportions of suitable additives which do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may be selected in order to facilitate administration of the active ingredient to the skin and/or be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These topical compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, a spot-on or an ointment Addition salts of the compounds of formula (I), due to their increased water<br>
solubility over the corresponding base form, are obviously more suitable in the preparation of aqueous compositions.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. "Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.

Such tablets may also be coated by methods well known in me art.<br>
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of e.g. solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be formulated as a dry product for admixture with water and/or another suitable liquid carrier before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means, optionally with other pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyknethylcellulose or hydrogenated edible fets), emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia), non-aqueous carriers (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol), sweeteners, flavours, masking agents and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable sweeteners useful in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise preferably at least one intense sweetener such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sodium cyclamate, alitame, a dihydrochalcone sweetener, monellin, stevioside sucralose(4,r,6'-trichloro-4,r,6'-trideoxygalactosucrose)or, preferably, saccharin, sodium or calcium saccharin, and optionally at least one bulk sweetener such as sorbitol, mannitol, fructose, sucrose, maltose, isomalt, glucose,<br>
hydrogenated glucose syrup, xylitol, caramel or honey. Intense sweeteners are conveniently used in low concentrations. For example, in the case of sodium saccharin, the said concentration may range from about 0.04% to 0,1% (weight/volume) of the final formulation. The bulk sweetener can effectively be used in larger concentrations ranging from about 10% to about 35%, preferably from about 10% to 15% (weight/volume).<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable flavours which can mask the bitter tasting ingredients in the low-dosage formulations are preferably fruit flavours such as cherry, raspberry, black currant or strawberry flavour. A combination of two flavours may yield very good results, la the high-dosage formulations, stronger pharmaceutically acceptable flavours may be required such as Caramel Chocolate, Mint Cool, Fantasy and the like. Each flavour may be present in the final composition in a concentration ranging from about 0.05% to 1% (weight/volume). Combinations of said strong flavours are advantageously used. Preferably a flavour is used that does not undergo any change or loss of taste and/or color under the circumstances of the formulation.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, conveniently intravenous, ultra-muscular or subcutaneous injection, for example by bolus injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in ampoules or multi-dose containers, including an added preservative. They may take such forms'as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as isotonizing, suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be present in powder form for mixing with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds of formula 00 may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and/or other glycerides.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be used in conjunction with other pharmaceutical agents, hi particular the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may ftnther comprise at least one additional lipid-lowering agent, thus leading to a so-called combination lipid-lowering therapy. The said additional lipid-lowering agent may be, for instance, a known drug conventionally used for the management of hyperlipidaemia such as e.g. a bile acid sequestrant resin, a fibric acid derivative or nicotinic acid as previously mentioned in the background of the invention. Suitable additional lipid-<br>

The lipid transfer assay mixture contained donor vesicles (40 nmol phosphatidylcholine, 7.5 mol % of cardiolipin and 0.25 mol % glycerol tri [l-14C]-oleate), acceptor vesicles (240 nmol phosphatidylcholine) and 5 mg BSA in a total volume of 675 ul in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Test compounds were added dissolved in DMSO (0.13 % final concentration). After 5 minutes of pre-incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was started by the addition of MTP in 100 ul dialysis buffer. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 400 ul DEAE-52 cellulose pre-equilibrated in 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1 mM EDTA, 0.02 % NaN3 (1:1, vol/vol). The mixture was agitated for 4 min and centrifuged for 2 min at maximum speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge (4°Q to pellet the DEAE-52-bound donor vesicles. An aliquot of the supernatant containing the acceptor liposomes was counted and the [14C]-counts were used to calculate the percent triglyceride transfer from donor to acceptor vesicles.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
