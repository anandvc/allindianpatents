FIELDOF THE INVENTION This invention relates to heavy duty liquid laundry detergent products which are<br>
aqueous in nature and which include particular types of improved alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures adapted for use by controlling compositional parameters, especially a<br>
2/3-Phenyl index. The presat application replaced 12 copedy appl n. Nos 2319/DEL/ 98,2061-DEL/9<br><br><br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION Historically, highly branched alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants, such as those<br>
based on tetrapropylene, known as "ABS" or "TPBS", were used in detergents. However, these were found to be very poorly biodegradable. A long period followed of improving manufacturing processes for alkylbenzene sulfonates, making them as linear as practically possible, hence the acronym "LAS". The overwhelming part of a large art of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant manufacture is directed to this objective. All relevant large-scale commercial alkylbenzene sulfonate processes in use today are directed to linear alkylbenzene sulfonates. However, linear alkylbenzene sulfonates are not without limitations; for example, they would be more desirable if improved for hard water cleaning and/or cold water cleaning properties. They can often fail to produce good cleaning results, for example when used in hard water areas.<br>
As a result of the limitations of the alkylbenzene sulfonates, consumer cleaning formulations have often needed to include a higher level of cosurfactants, builders, and other additives than would have been needed given a superior alkylbenzene sulfonate.<br>
The art of alkylbenzene sulfonate detergents is replete with references which teach both for and against almost every aspect of these compositions. Moreover, there are believed to be erroneous teachings and technical misconceptions about the mechanism of LAS operation under m-use conditions, particularly in the area of hardness tolerance. The volume of such references debases the art as a whole and makes it difficult to select the useful teachings from the useless without repeated experimentation. To further<br><br>
understand the state of the art, it should be appreciated that there has been not only a lack of clarity on which way to go to fix the unresolved problems of linear LAS, but also a range of misconceptions, not only in the understanding of biodegradation but also in basic mechanisms of operation of LAS in presence of hardness.<br>
Also, while the currently commercial, essentially linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are relatively simple compositions to  define and  analyze,  compositions containing both branched and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants are complex, In general such compositions can be highly varied, containing one or more different kinds of branching in any of a number of positions on the aliphatic chain. A very large number, e.g., hundreds, of distinct chemical species are possible in such mixtures. Accordingly there  is  an onerous   burden  of experimentation  if it  is  desired   to   improve  such compositions so that they can clean better in detergent compositions while at the same time remaining biodegradable. The formulator's knowledge is key to guiding this effort.<br>
Yet another currently unresolved problem in alkylbenzene sulfonate manufacture is to make more effective use of current LAB feedstocks. It would be highly desirable, both from a performance point of view and from an economic point of view, to better utilize certain desirable types of branched hydrocarbons.<br>
Accordingly there is a substantial unmet need for further improvements in alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures, especially with respect to those offering one or more of the advantages of superior cleaning, hardness tolerance, satisfactory biodegradability, and cost.<br>

All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (Â°C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The aqueous liquid detergent compositions of this invention comprise a modified<br>
alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture.  The essential and optional components of the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and other optional materials of the aqueous liquid detergent compositions herein, as well as composition form, preparation and use, are described in greater detail as follows: (All concentrations and ratios are on a weight basis unless otherwise specified.)    The invention, on the other hand, is not intended to encompass any wholly conventional liquid detergent compositions, such as those based exclusively on linear alkylbenzene sulfonates made by any process, or exclusively on known unacceptably branched alkylbenzene sulfonates such as ABS or TPBS.<br>
It is preferred that when the detergent compositions of the present invention comprise any alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant other than said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture (for example as a result of blending into the detergent composition   one   or  more  commercial,   especially  linear,   typically   linear   C1o-C14, alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants),  said composition is further characterized by an overall 2/3-phenyl index of at least about 200, preferably at least about 250, more preferably at least about 350, more preferably still, at least about 500, wherein said overall 2/3-phenyl index is determined by measuring 2/3-phenyl index, as defined herein, on a blend of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said any other alkylbenzene sulfonate to be added to said composition, said blend, for purposes of measurement, being prepared from aliquots of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said other alkylbenzene sulfonate not yet exposed to any other of the components of said composition; and further provided that when said composition comprises any alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant other than said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture (for example as a result of blending into the composition one<br><br>
or more commercial, especially linear, typically linear C1o-C14, alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants), said composition is further characterized by an overall 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of less than about 0.3, preferably from 0 to 0.2, more preferably no more than about 0.1, more preferably still, no more than about 0.05, wherein said overall 2-methyl-2-phenyl index is to be determined by measuring 2-methyl-2-phenyl index, as defined herein, on a blend of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and any other alkylbenzene sulfonate to be added to said composition, said blend, for purposes of measurement, being prepared from aliquots of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture and said other alkylbenzene sulfonate not yet exposed to any other of the components of said composition.   These provisions may appear somewhat unusual, however they are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention, which encompasses a number of economical but less preferred approaches in terms of overall cleaning   performance,   such   as   blending   of the   modified   alkylbenzene   sulfonate surfactants with conventional linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants either during synthesis or during formulation into the composition.   Moreover, as is well known to practitioners of hand dishwashing analysis, a number of hand dishwashing adjuncts (paramagnetic materials and sometimes even water) are capable of interfering with methods for determining the parameters of alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures as described hereinafter. Hence wherever possible, analysis should be conducted on dry materials before mixing them into the compositions.<br>
in one prefered embodiment the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture in the hand dishwashing composition accoring to the composition according to the first embodiment is prepared by a process comprising a step selected from:<br>
blending a mixture of branched and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants having a 2/3-phenyl index of 500 to 700 with an alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture having a 2/3-phenyl index of 75 to 160 (typically this alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant is a commercial C1o-C14 linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant, e.g., DETAL Â® process LAS or HF process LAS though in general any commercial linear (LAS) or branched (ABS, TPBS) type can be used); and<br><br>
blending a mixture of branched and linear alkylbenzenes having a 2/3-phenyl index of 500 to 700 with an alkylbenzene mixture having a 2/3-phenyl index of 75 to 160 and sulfonating said blend.<br>
Moreover,   the   invention   encompasses   the   addition   of   useful   hydrotrope precursors and/or hydrotropes, such as C1-C8 alkylbenzenes, more typically toluenes, cumenes, xylenes, naphthalenes, or the sulfonated derivatives of any such materials, minor amounts of any other materials, such as tribranched  alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants,  dialkylbenzenes and  their derivatives,  dialkyl tetralins,  wetting  agents, processing  aids,  and the  like.  It will  be understood that,  with  the  exception of hydrotropes, it will not be usual practice in the present invention to include any such materials. Likewise it will be understood that such materials, if and when they interfere with analytical methods, will not be included in samples of compositions used for analytical purposes.<br>
A preferred modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to first embodiment of the present invention has M selected from H, Na, K and mixtures thereof, said a=l, said b=l, said q=l, and said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture has a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of less than about 0.3, preferably less than about 0.2, more preferably from 0 to about 0.1.<br>
Related to the composition are methods of their use, such as a method contacting soiled tableware in need of cleaning with either a neat or an aqueous solution of the composition of the invention. Such methods may optionally include the step of diluting the composition with water. Furthermore, the composition may be applied, either neat or as an aqueous solution, directly to the tableware or surface to be cleaned or directly to a cleaning implement, such as a sponge or a wash cloth. Such methods are part of the present invention.<br>
Such a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according can be made as the product of a process using as catalyst a zeolite selected from mordenite, offretite and H-ZSM-12 in at least partially acidic form, preferably an acidic mordenite (in general certain forms of zeolite beta can be used as an alternative but are not preferred). Embodiments described in terms of their making, as well as suitable catalysts, are all further detailed hereinafter.<br><br>
Another preferred modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture according to the first embodiment of the invention consists essentially of said mixture of branched alkylbenzene sulfonates and nonbranched  alkylbenzene sulfonates,  wherein said 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of said modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixture is less than about 0.1, and wherein in said mixture of branched and nonbranched alkylbenzene sulfonates, said average aliphatic carbon content is from about 11.5 to about 12.5 carbon atoms; said R1 is methyl; said R2 is selected from H and methyl provided that in at least about 0.7 mole fraction of said branched alkylbenzene sulfonates R2 is H; and wherein said sum of carbon atoms in R1, L and R2 is from 10 to 14; and further wherein in said mixture of nonbranched alkylbenzene sulfonates, said Y has a sum of carbon atoms of from 10 to 14 carbon atoms, said average aliphatic carbon content of said nonbranched alkylbenzene sulfonates is from about 11.5 to about 12.5 carbon atoms, and said M is a monovalent cation or cation mixture selected from H, Na and mixtures thereof. Definitions:<br>
Methyl termini The terms "methyl termini" and/or "terminal methyl" mean the carbon atoms which are the terminal carbon atoms in alkyl moieties, that is L, and/or Y of formula (I) and formula (II) respectively are always bonded to three hydrogen atoms. That is, they will form a CH3- group.   To better explain this, the structure below shows the two terminal methyl groups in an alkylbenzene sulfonate.<br><br>

current commercial, more biodegradable type, which on sulfonation forms linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, or "LAS". The term "MLAS" herein is an abbreviation for the modified alkylbenzene sulfonate mixtures of the invention.<br>
Impurities:   The   surfactant  mixtures   herein   are   preferably   substantially   free   from impurities selected from tribranched impurities, dialkyl tetralin impurities and mixtures thereof.    By "substantially free" it is meant that the amounts of such impurities are insufficient to contribute positively or negatively to the cleaning effectiveness of the composition. Typically there is less than about 5%, preferably less than about 1%, more preferably about 0.1% or less of the impurity, that is typically no one of the impurities is practically detectable. Illustrative Structures<br>
The better to illustrate the possible complexity of modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures of the invention and the resulting detergent compositions, structures (a) to (v) below are illustrative of some of the many preferred compounds of formula (I). These are only a few of hundreds of possible preferred structures that make<br>
up the bulk of the composition, and should not be taken as limiting of the invention.<br>

Preferably the branched alkylbenzene sulfonate is the product of sulfonating a branched alkylbenzene, wherein the branched alkylbenzene is produced by alkylating benzene with a branched olefin over an zeolite beta catalyst which may be fluoridated or non-fluoridated, more preferably the zeolite beta catalyst is an acidic zeolite beta catalyst. The preferred acidic zeolite beta catalysts are HF-treated calcined zeolite beta catalysts.<br>
In outline, modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant mixtures herein can be made by the steps of:<br>
(I) alkylating benzene with an alkylating mixture; (IT) sulfonating the product of (I); and (optionally but very preferably) (III) neutralizing the product of (IT).<br>
Provided that suitable alkylation catalysts and process conditions as taught herein are used, the product of step (I) is a modified alkylbenzene mixture in accordance with the invention. Provided that sulfonation is conducted under conditions generally known and reapplicable from LAS manufacture, see for example the literature references cited herein, the product of step (II) is a modified alkylbenzene sulfonic acid mixture in accordance with the invention. Provided that neutralization step (II) is conducted as generally taught herein, the product of step (III) is a modified alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant  mixture  in  accordance with  the  invention.   Since  neutralization  can   be incomplete,   mixtures   of the  acid  and  neutralized   forms   of the  present  modified alkylbenzene sulfonate systems in all proportions, e.g., from about 1000:1 to 1:1000 by weight, are also part of the present invention. Overall, the greatest criticalities are in step (I).<br>
Thus it is further preferred that in step (I) the alkylation is performed at a temperature of from about 125Â°C to about 230Â°C, preferably from about 175Â°C to about 215Â°C and at a pressure of from about 50 psig to about 1000 psig, preferably from about 100 psig to about 250 psig. Time for this alkylation reaction can vary, however it is further preferred that the time for this alkylation be from about 0.01 hour to about 18 hours, more preferably, as rapidly as possible, more typically from about 0.1 hour to about 5 hours, or from about 0.1 hour to about 3 hours.<br>
In general it is found preferable in step (I) to couple together the use of relatively low temperatures (e.g., 175Â°C to about 215Â°C) with reaction times of medium duration (1 hour to about 8 hours) in the above-indicated ranges.<br>
Moreover, it is contemplated that the alkylation "step" (I) herein can be "staged" so that two or more reactors operating under different conditions in the defined ranges may be useful. By operating a plurality of such reactors, it is possible to allow for material with less preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index to be initially formed and, surprisingly, to convert such material into material with a more preferred 2-methyl-2-phenyl index.<br>
Thus a surprising discovery as part of the present invention is that one can attain low levels of quaternary alkylbenzenes in zeolite beta catalyzed reactions of benzene with branched olefins, as characterized by a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of less than 0.1. Alkylation Catalyst<br>
The present invention uses a particularly defined alkylation catalyst. Such catalyst comprises a moderate acidity, medium-pore zeolite defined in detail hereinafter. A particularly preferred alkylation catalyst comprises at least partially dealuminized acidic nonfluoridated or at least partially dealuminized acidic fluoridated zeolite beta.<br>
Numerous alkylation catalysts are readily determined to be unsuitable. Unsuitable alkylation catalysts include the DETALÂ® process catalysts, aluminum chloride, HF, and many others. Indeed no alkylation catalyst currently used for alkylation in the commercial production of detergent linear alkylbenzenesulfonates is suitable.<br>
In contrast, suitable alkylation catalyst herein is selected from shape-selective moderately acidic alkylation catalysts, preferably zeolitic. More particularly, the zeolite in such catalysts for the alkylation step step I is preferably selected from the group<br><br>
consisting of ZSM-4, ZSM-20, and zeolite beta, more preferably zeolite beta, in at least partially acidic form. More preferably, the zeolite in step  I (the alkylation step) is substantially in acid form and is contained in a catalyst pellet comprising a conventional binder and further wherein said catalyst pellet comprises at least about  1  %, more preferably at least 5%, more typically from 50% to about 90%, of said zeolite, wherein said zeolite is preferably a zeolite beta. More generally, suitable alkylation catalyst is typically at  least partially crystalline,  more preferably substantially crystalline not including binders  or other materials  used  to  form  catalyst  pellets,   aggregates  or composites. Moreover the catalyst is typically at least partially acidic zeolite beta.   This catalyst is useful for the alkylation step identified as step I in the claims hereinafter.<br>
The  largest pore diameter characterizing the  zeolites  useful   in  the present alkylation process may be in the range of 6Angstrom to 8Angstrom, such as in zeolite beta. It should be understood that, in any case, the zeolites used as catalysts in the alkylation step of the present process have a major pore dimension intermediate between that of the large pore zeolites, such as the X and Y zeolites, and the relatively smaller pore size zeolites such as mordenite, offretite, HZSM-12 and HZSM-5. Indeed ZSM-5 has been tried and found inoperable in the present invention. The pore size dimensions and crystal  structures of certain zeolites  are specified  in  ATLAS   OF ZEOLITE STRUCTURE TYPES by W. M. Meier and D. H. Olson, published by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association (1978 and more recent editions) and distributed by Polycrystal Book Service, Pittsburgh, Pa.<br>
The zeolites useful in the alkylation step of the instant process generally have at least 10 percent of the cationic sites thereof occupied by ions other than alkali or alkaline-earth  metals.  Typical but non-limiting replacing  ions  include  ammonium, hydrogen, rare earth, zinc, copper and aluminum. Of this group, particular preference is accorded ammonium, hydrogen, rare  earth  or combinations  thereof.  In  a preferred embodiment, the zeolites are converted to the predominantly hydrogen form, generally by replacement of the alkali metal or other ion originally present with  hydrogen ion precursors, e.g., ammonium ions, which upon calcination yield the hydrogen form. This exchange is conveniently carried out by contact of the zeolite with an ammonium salt solution, e.g., ammonium chloride, utilizing well known ion exchange techniques. In<br><br>
certain preferred embodiments, the extent of replacement is such as to produce a zeolite material in which at least 50 percent of the cationic sites are occupied by hydrogen ions.<br>
The zeolites may be subjected to various chemical treatments, including alumina extraction  (dealumination)  and  combination  with  one  or more  metal   components, particularly the metals of Groups IIB, III, IV, VI, VII and VIII. It is also contemplated that the zeolites may, in some instances, desirably be subjected to thermal treatment, including steaming or calcination in air, hydrogen or an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen or helium. A suitable modifying treatment entails steaming of the zeolite by contact with an atmosphere containing from about 5 to about 100% steam at a temperature of from about 250Â°C to 1000Â°C. Steaming may last for a period of between about 0.25 and about 100 hours and may be conducted at pressures ranging from sub-atmospheric to several hundred atmospheres.<br>
In practicing the desired alkylation step of the instant process, it may be useful to incorporate the above-described intermediate pore size crystalline zeolites in another material,  e.g., a binder or matrix resistant to the temperature and other conditions employed in the process. Such matrix materials include synthetic or naturally occurring substances as well as inorganic materials such as clay, silica, and/or metal oxides. Matrix materials can be in the form of gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gels or gelatinous precipitates. Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the zeolite include those of the montmorillonite and kaolin families, which families include the sub-bentonites and the kaolins commonly known as Dixie, McNamee-Georgia and Florida clays or others in which the main mineral constituent is halloysite, kaolinite, dickite, nacrite or anauxite. Such clays can be used in the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical modification.<br>
In addition to the foregoing materials, the intermediate pore size zeolites employed herein may be compounded with a porous matrix material, such as alumina, silica-alumina, silica-magnesia, silica-zirconia, silica-thoria, silica-beryllia, and silica-titania, as well as ternary combinations, such as silica-alumina-thoria, silica-alumina-zirconia, silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zirconia. The matrix may be in the form of a cogel. The relative proportions of finely divided zeolite and inorganic oxide gel<br><br>
matrix may vary widely, with the zeolite content ranging from between about 1 to about 99% by weight and more usually in the range of about 5 to about 80% by weight of the composite.<br>
A group of zeolites which includes some useful for the alkylation step herein have a silica:alumina ratio of at least 10:1, preferably at least 20:1. The silica:alumina ratios referred to in this specification are the structural or framework ratios, that is, the ratio for the SiO4 to the A1O4 tetrahedra. This ratio may vary from the silicaralumina ratio determined by various physical and chemical methods. For example, a gross chemical analysis may include aluminum which is present in the form of cations associated with the acidic sites on the zeolite, thereby giving a low silica:alumina ratio. Similarly, if the ratio is determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of ammonia desorption, a low ammonia titration may be obtained if cationic aluminum prevents exchange of the ammonium ions onto the acidic sites. These disparities are particularly troublesome when certain treatments such as the dealuminization methods described below which result in the presence of ionic aluminum free of the zeolite structure are employed. Due care should therefore be taken to ensure that the framework silica:alumina ratio is correctly determined.<br>
When the zeolites have been prepared in the presence of organic cations they are catalytically inactive, possibly because the intracrystalline free space is occupied by organic cations from the forming solution. They may be activated by heating in an inert atmosphere at 540Â°C. for one hour, for example, followed by base exchange with ammonium salts followed by calcination at 540Â°C in air. The presence of organic cations in the forming solution may not be absolutely essential to the formation of the zeolite; but it does appear to favor the formation of this special type of zeolite. Some natural zeolites may sometimes be converted to zeolites of the desired type by various activation procedures and other treatments such as base exchange, steaming, alumina extraction and calcination. The zeolites preferably have a crystal framework density, in the dry hydrogen form, not substantially below about 1.6 g.cm -3. The dry density for known structures may be calculated from the number of silicon plus aluminum atoms per 1000 cubic Angstroms, as given, e.g., on page 19 of the article on Zeolite Structure by W. M. Meier included in "Proceedings of the Conference on Molecular Sieves, London, April 1967",<br><br>
published by the Society of Chemical Industry, London, 1968. Reference is made to this paper for a discussion of the crystal framework density. A further discussion of crystal framework density, together with values for some typical zeolites, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 4,016,218, to which reference is made. When synthesized in the alkali metal form, the zeolite is conveniently converted to the hydrogen form, generally by intermediate formation of the ammonium form as a result of ammonium ion exchange and calcination of the ammonium form to yield the hydrogen form. It has been found that although the hydrogen form of the zeolite catalyzes the reaction successfully, the zeolite may also be partly in the alkali metal form.<br>
Prefered zeolite catalysts include zeolite beta, HZSM-4, HZSM-20 and HZSM-38. Most prefered catalyst is acidic zeolite beta. A zeolite beta suitable for use herein is disclosed in US3,308,069 to which reference is made for details of this zeolite and its preparation.<br>
Zeolite beta catalysts in the acid form are also commercially available as Zeocat PB/H from Zeochem. Other zeolite beta catalysts suitable for use can be provided by UOP Chemical Catalysts and Zeolyst International.<br>
Most generally, alkylation catalysts may be used herein provided that the alkylation catalyst 1) can accommodate into the smallest pore diameter of said catalyst said branched olefins described herein and 2) selectively alkylate benzene with said branched olefins and/or mixture with nonbranched olefins with sufficient selectivity to provide the 2/3-Ph index values defined herein.<br>
In one preferred mode, a hydrotrope or hydrotrope precursor is added either after step (I), during or after step (II) and prior to step (III) or during or after step (III). The hydrotropes are selected from any suitable hydrotrope, typically a sulfonic acid or sodium sulfonate salt of toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. The hydrotropes precursors are selected from any suitable, hydrotrope precursor typically toluene, cumene, xylene, napthalene or mixtures thereof. Sulfonation and Workup or Neutralization (Steps II/ IS)<br>
Preferably the sulfonating step (II) is performed using a sulfonating agent, preferably selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide with or without air, chlorosulfonic acid, oleum, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, it is<br><br>
preferable in step (II) to remove components other than monoalkylbenzene prior to contacting the product of step (I) with sulfonating agent.<br>
In general, sulfonation of the modified alkylbenzenes in the instant process can be accomplished using any of the well-known sulfonation systems, including those described  in   "Detergent  Manufacture  Including  Zeolite  Builders   and  other New Materials", Ed. Sittig., Noyes Data Corp., 1979, as well as in Vol. 56 in "Surfactant Science" series, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1996, including in particular Chapter 2 entitled   "Alkylarylsulfonates:   History,   Manufacture,   Analysis   and   Environmental Properties", pages 39-108 which includes 297 literature references. This work provides access to a great deal of literature describing various processes and process steps, not only sulfonation but also dehydrogenation, alkylation, alkylbenzene distillation and the like. Common sulfonation systems useful herein include sulfuric acid, chlorosulfonic acid, oleum, sulfur trioxide and the like. Sulfur trioxide/air is especially preferred. Details of sulfonation using a suitable air/sulfur trioxide mixture are provided in US 3,427,342,  Chemithon. Sulfonation processes  are further extensively described in "Sulfonation Technology in the Detergent Industry", W.H. de Groot, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1991.<br>
Any convenient workup steps may be used in the present process. Common practice is to neutralize after sulfonation with any suitable alkali. Thus the neutralization step  can be  conducted using alkali  selected  from  sodium,  potassium,  ammonium, magnesium and substituted ammonium alkalis and mixtures thereof. Potassium can assist solubility, magnesium can promote soft water performance and substituted ammonium can  be helpful  for formulating specialty variations  of the instant  surfactants.  The invention     encompasses     any    of    these     derivative     forms     of    the     modified alkylbenzenesulfonate surfactants as produced by the present process and their use in consumer product compositions.<br>
Alternately the acid form of the present surfactants can be added directly to acidic cleaning products, or can be mixed with cleaning ingredients and then neutralized.<br>
Preferably the neutralisation step (III) is performed using a basic salt. Preferably the basic salt having a cation selected from the group consisting of alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, substituted ammonium, and mixtures thereof and an anion<br><br>
selected from hydroxide, oxide, carbonate, silicate, phosphate and mixtures thereof. More preferably the basic salt is selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The processes are tolerant of variation, for example conventional steps can be added before, in parallel with, or after the outlined steps (I), (II) and (III). This is especially the case for accomodating the use of hydrotropes or their precursors.<br>

With mixing, the reaction mixture is heated. At about 75Â°C, the reaction initiates and begins consuming H2 and exotherms to 170-180Â°C. In 10-15 minutes, the temperature has dropped to 100-110Â°C and the pressure dropped to 500 psig. The autoclave is boosted to 1000 psig with H2 and mixed at 100-110Â°C for an additional 1 hour and 40 minutes with the reaction consuming an additional 160 psig H2<br><br>
but at which time no more H2 consumption is observed. Upon cooling the autoclave to 40Â°C, the reaction mixture removed, filtered to remove catalyst and concentrated by evaporation of methanol under vacuum to yield 297.75 g of 6,10-dimethyl-2-undecanol.<br>

To a glass autoclave liner is added 249 g of 5,7-dimethyl-3,5,9-decatrien-2-one, 2.2 g or 5% ruthenium on carbon and 200 ml of methanol. The glass liner is sealed inside a 3 L,  stainless steel, rocking autoclave and the autoclave purged once with 250 psig N2, once with 250 psig H2 and then charged with 500 psig H2. With mixing, the reaction mixture is heated. At about 75Â°C, the reaction initiates and begins consuming H2 and exotherms to 170Â°C. In 10 minutes, the temperature has dropped to 115-120Â°C and the pressure dropped to 270 psig. The autoclave is boosted to 1000 psig with H2, mixed at 110-115Â°C for an additional 7 hours and 15 minutes then cooled to 30Â°C. The reaction mixture is removed from autoclave, filtered to remove catalyst and concentrated by evaporation of methanol under vacuum to yield 225.8 g of 5,7-dimethyl-2-decanoI.<br>

(A starting-material for branched olefms)<br>
A mixture of 671.2 g of citral and 185.6 g of diethyl ether is added to an addition funnel. The citral mixture is then added dropwise over a five hour period to a nitrogen blanketed, stirred, 5 L, 3-neck, round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser containing 1.6 L of 3.0 M methylmagnesium bromide solution and an additional 740 ml of diethyl ether. The reaction flask is situated in an ice water bath to control exotherm and subsequent ether reflux. After addition is complete, the ice water bath is removed and the reaction allowed to mix for an additional 2 hours at 20-25Â°C at which point the reaction mixture is added to 3.5 Kg of cracked ice with good mixing. To this mixture is added 1570 g of 30% sulfuric acid solution. The aqueous acid layer is drained and the remaining ether layer washed twice with 2 L of water. The ether layer is concentrated by evaporation of<br><br>
the ether under vacuum to yield 720.6 g of 4,8-dimethyl-3,7-nonadien-2-ol. To a glass autoclave liner is added 249.8 g of the 4,8-dimethyl-3,7-nonadien-2-ol, 5.8 g or 5% palladium on activated carbon and 200 ml of n-hexane. The glass liner is sealed inside a 3 L, stainless steel, rocking autoclave and the autoclave purged twice with 250 psig N2, once with 250 psig H2 and then charged with 100 psig H2. Upon mixing, the reaction initiates and begins consuming H2 and exotherms to 75Â°C. The autoclave is heated to 80Â°C, boosted to 500 psig with H2, mixed for 3 hours and then cooled to 30Â°C. The reaction mixture is removed from autoclave, filtered to remove catalyst and concentrated by evaporation of n-hexane under vacuum to yield 242 g of 4,8-dimethyl-2-nonanol.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>

alkylbenzenes in accordance with the invention)<br>
To a nitrogen blanketed, 2 L, 3-neck round bottom flask equipped with thermometer, mechanical stirrer and a Dean-Stark trap with reflux condenser is added 225 g of 4,8-dimethyl-2-nonanol (example 11), 450 g of 5,7-dimethyl-2:decanol (example 10), 225 g of 6,10-dimethyl-2-undecanol (example 9) and 180 g of a shape selective zeolite catalyst (acidic mordenite catalyst Zeocatâ¢ FM-8/25H). With mixing, the mixture is heated (135-160Â°C) to the point water and some olefin is driven off and collected in Dean-Stark trap at a moderate rate. After a few hours, the rate of water collection slows and the temperature rises to 180-195Â°C where the reaction is allowed to mix for an additional 2-4 hours. The dimethyl branched olefin mixture remaining in the flask is filtered to remove the catalyst. The catalyst filter cake is slurried with 500 ml of hexane and vacuum filtered. The catalyst filter cake is washed twice with 100 ml of hexane and the filtrate concentrated by evaporation of the hexane under vacuum. The resulting product is combined with the first filtrate to give 820 g of dimethyl branched olefin mixture with randomized branching.<br>

The mixture is stirred and heated to about 205Â°C for about 8 hours. The autoclave is cooled to about 30Â°C overnight. The valve is opened leading from the autoclave to the benzene condenser and collection tank. The autoclave is heated to about 120Â°C with continuous collection of benzene. No more benzene is collected by the time the reactor reaches 120Â°C and the reactor is then cooled to 40Â°C. The autoclave is then drained to remove the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is filtered to remove catalyst and vacuum pulled on the mixture to remove any residual traces of benzene. The product is distilled under vacuum (1-5 mm of Hg). The dimethyl branched alkylbenzene mixture with randomized branching and 2/3-Phenyl Index of about 200 and a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of about 0.04 is collected from 88Â°C - 160Â°C.<br>

Methods for Determining Compositional Parameters (2/3-phenyl index, 2-methyl-2-phenyl index) of Mixed Alkylbenzene/ Alkylbenzenesulfonate/ Alkylbenzenesulfonic Acid Systems.<br>
It is well known in the art to determine compositional parameters of conventional linear alkylbenzenes and/or highly branched alkylbenzenesulfonates (TPBS, ABS). See, for example Surfactant Science Series, Volume 40, Chapter 7 and Surfactant Science Series, Volume 73, Chapter 7.    Typically this is done by GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy for the alkylbenzenes and HPLC for the alkylbenzenesulfonates or sulfonic acids; 13C nmr is also commonly used. Another common practice is desulfonation. This permits GC and/or GC-mass spectroscopy to be used, since desulfonation converts the sulfonates or sulfonic acids to the alkylbenzenes which are tractable by such methods.<br>
In general, the present invention provides unique and relatively complex mixtures of alkylbenzenes,  and  similarly complex  surfactant mixtures  of alkylbenzenesulfonates and/or alkylbenzenesulfonic acids. Compositional parameters of such compositions can be determined using variations and combinations of the art-known methods.<br>
The sequence of methods to be used depends on the composition to be characterized as follows:<br><br>

Standards required for this method are 2-phenyloctane and 2-phenylpentadecane, each freshly distilled to a purity of greater than 98%.  Run both standards using the conditions specified above to define the retention time for each standard.   This defines a rentention time  range  which  is  the retention   time  range  to   be  used  for characterizing any alkylbenzenes or allcylbenzene mixtures in the context of this  invention (e.g., test samples).    Now run the test samples for which compositional parameters are to be determined.   Test samples pass the GC test provided that greater than 90% of the total GC area percent is within the retention time range defined by the two standards.   Test samples that pass the GC test can be used directly in the NMRl and NMR2 test methods. Test samples that do not pass the GC test must be further purified by distillation until the test sample passes the GC test.<br>
DESULFONATION (DE)<br>
The desulfonation method is a standard method described in "The Analysis of Detergents and Detergent Products" by G. F. Longman on pages   197-199. Two other useful descriptions of this standard method are given on page 230-231 of volume 40 of the Surfactant Sience Series edited by T. M. Schmitt: "Analysis of Surfactants" and on page 272 of volume 73 of the Surfactant Science Series: "Anionic Surfactants" edited by John Cross.  This  is  an  alternative method  to  the  HPLC  method,  described  herein,  for evaluation  of the branched  and nonbranched  alkylbenzenesulfonic acid  and/or salt mixtures (Modified Alkylbenzensulfonic  acid and  or salt Mixtures).     The method<br><br>
provides a means of converting the sulfonic acid and/or salt mixture into branched and nonbranched alkylbenzene mixtures which can then be analyzed by means of the GC and NMR methods NMR1 and NMR2 described herein.<br><br>

This prepares ca. 1500 ppm solution of the mixed standard. C.         Sample Solutions<br>
1. Wash Solutions - Transfer 250 ÂµL of the standard solution to a 1 mL autosampler vial and add 750 ÂµL of the wash solution. Cap and place in the autosampler tray.<br>
2.         Alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or Alkvlbenzenesulfonate - Weigh 0.10 g of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid or salt and quantitatively transfer to a 100 mL volumetric flask.   Dissolve with 30 mL ACN and dilute to volume with HPLC grade water.   Transfer 250 ÂµL of the standard solution to a 1 mL autosampler vial and add 750 ÂµL of the sample solution.   Cap and place in the autosampler tray.    If solution is excessively turbid, filter through 0.45 Âµm membrane before transferring to auto-sampler vial.  Cap and place in the auto-sampler tray.

The HPLC elution time of the 2-phenyloctylbenzenesulfonate defines the lower limit and the elution time of the 2-phenylpentadecanesulfonate standard defines the upper limit of the HPLC analysis relating to the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid/salt mixture of the invention. If 90% of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid/salt mixture components have retention times within the range of the above standards then the sample can be further defined by methods NMR 3 and NMR 4.<br><br>
If  the   alkylbenzenesulfonic   acid/salt   mixture   contains    10%   or   more   of components outside the retention limits defined by the standards then the mixture should be further purified by method HPLC-P or by DE, DIS methods.<br>
HPLC Preparative (HPLC-P)<br>
Alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or greater) are purified by preparative HPLC. See, for example Surfactant Science Series, Volume 40, Chapter 7 and Surfactant Science Series, Volume 73, Chapter 7. This is routine to one skilled in the art. A sufficient quantity should be purified to meet the requirements of the NMR 3 and NMR 4.<br>
DISTILLATION (PIS)<br>
A 5 liter, 3-necked round bottom flask with 24/40 joints is equipped with a magnetic stir bar.  A few boiling chips (Hengar Granules,   catalog #136-C) are added to the flask.  A 91/2 inch long vigreux condenser with a 24/40 joint is placed in the center neck of the flask.  A water cooled condenser is attached to the top of the vigreux condenser which is fitted with a calibrated thermometer.  A vacuum receiving flask is attached to the end of the condenser.   A glass stopper is placed in one side arm of the 5 liter flask and a calibrated thermometer in the other.   The flask and the vigreux condenser are wrapped with aluminum foil.   To the 5 liter flask, is added 2270 g of an alkylbenzene mixture which contains 10% or more impurities as defined by the GC method.   A vacuum line leading from a vacuum pump is attached to the receiving flask.    The alkylbenzene mixture in the 5 liter flask is stirred and vacuum is applied to the system.   Once the maximum vacuum is reached (at least 1  inch of Hg pressure by gauge or less), the alkylbenzene mixture is heated by means of an electric heating mantle.   The distillate is collected in two fractions.   Fraction A is collected from about 25Â°C to about 90Â°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column.   Fraction B is collected from about 90Â°C to about 155Â°C as measured by the calibrated thermometer at the top of the vigreux column.  Fraction A and pot residues (high boiling) are discarded. Fraction B (1881 g) contains the alkylbenzene mixture of interest. The method can be scaled according to the practitioner's needs provided that sufficient quantity of the<br><br>
alkylbenzene mixture remains after distillation for evaluation by NMR methods NMR1<br>
andNMR2.<br>
Preparative LC method using Mega Bond Elut Sep PakÂ® (HPLC-P)<br>
Alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and/or the salts which contain substantial impurities (10% or<br>
greater) can also be purified by an LC method (also defined herein as HPLC-P).<br>
This procedure is actually preferred over HPLC column prep purification.<br>
As much as 500 mg of unpurified MLAS salts can be loaded onto a 1 Og(60ml) Mega<br>
Bond Elut Sep PakÂ® and with optimized chromatography the purified MLAS salt can be<br>
isolated and ready for freeze drying within 2 hours. A 100 mg sample of Modified<br>
alkylbenzenesulfonate salt can be loaded onto a 5g(20ml) Bond Elut Sep Pak and ready<br>
within the same amount of time.<br>

ACIDIFICATION (Ac)<br>
Salts of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids are acidified by common means such as reaction in a<br>
solvent with HC1 or sulfuric acid or by use of an acidic resin such as Amberlyst 15.<br>
Acificication is routine to one skilled in the art.   After acidifying remove all solvents,<br>
especially any moisture, so that the samples are anhydrous and solvent-free.<br>
Note: For all of the below NMR test methods, the chemical shifts of the NMR spectrum<br>
are either externally or internally referenced to TMS in CDCl3, i.e. chloroform.<br>

Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. Patent 3,128,287, issued April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. Patent 3,635,830, issued January 18, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. Patent 4,663,071, issued to Bush et al, on May 5, 1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the 05-C2O alkyl  and  alkenyl succinic acids and  salts  thereof.     A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include:   laurylsuccinate,   myristylsuccinate,   palmitylsuccinate,   2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like.    Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders    of   this    group,    and    are    described    in    European   Patent    Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al, issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br><br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used. OTHER OPTIONAL COMPOSITION COMPONENTS<br>
In addition to the liquid and solid phase components as hereinbefore described, the aqueous based detergent compositions can, and preferably will, contain various other optional components.   Such optional components may be in either liquid or solid form. The optional components may either dissolve in the liquid phase or may be dispersed within the liquid phase in the form of fine particles or droplets. Some of the other materials which may optionally be utilized in the compositions herein are described in greater detail as follows: Optional Inorganic Detergent Builders<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more types of inorganic  detergent builders beyond those listed hereinbefore that also function as alkalinity   sources.      Such   optional   inorganic   builders   can   include,   for   example, aluminosilicates such as zeolites.   Aluminosilicate zeolites, and their use as detergent builders are more fully discussed in Corkill et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,605,509; Issued August 12, 1986, the disclosure of which   is incorporated herein by reference.   Also crystalline layered silicates, such as those discussed in this 509 U.S. patent, are also suitable for use in the detergent compositions herein.    If utilized, optional inorganic detergent builders can comprise from about 2% to 15% by weight of the compositions herein. Optional Enzymes<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more types of detergent enzymes. Such enzymes can include proteases, amylases, cellulases and lipases. Such materials are known in the art and are commercially available. They may be incorporated into the non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions herein in the form of suspensions, "marumes" or "prills". Another suitable type of enzyme comprises those in the form of slurries of enzymes in nonionic surfactants, e.g., the enzymes marketed by<br><br>
Novo Nordisk under the tradename "SL" or the microencapsulated enzymes marketed by Novo Nordisk under the tradename "LDP."<br>
Enzymes added to the compositions herein in the form of conventional enzyme prills are especially preferred for use herein. Such prills will generally range in size from about 100 to 1,000 microns, more preferably from about 200 to 800 microns and will be suspended throughout the non-aqueous liquid phase of the composition. Prills in the compositions of the present invention have been found, in comparison with other enzyme forms, to exhibit especially desirable enzyme stability in terms of retention of enzymatic activity over time. Thus, compositions which utilize enzyme prills need not contain conventional enzyme stabilizing such as must frequently be used when enzymes are incorporated into aqueous liquid detergents.<br>
If employed, enzymes will normally be incorporated into the non-aqueous liquid compositions herein at levels sufficient to provide up to about 10 mg by weight, more typically from about 0.01   mg to  about 5 mg,  of active enzyme per gram of the composition.   Stated otherwise, the non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions herein will typically comprise from about 0.001% to 5%, preferably from about 0.01% to 1% by weight, of a commercial enzyme preparation. Protease enzymes, for example, are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition. Optional Chelating Agents<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain a chelating agent which serves to chelate metal ions, e.g., iron and/or manganese, within the non-aqueous detergent compositions herein. Such chelating agents thus serve to form complexes with metal impurities in the composition which would otherwise tend to deactivate composition components such as the peroxygen bleaching agent. Useful chelating agents can include amino carboxylates, phosphonates, amino phosphonates, polyfunctionally-substituted aromatic chelating agents and mixtures thereof.<br>
*<br>
Amino     carboxylates     useful      as     optional      chelating     agents      include<br>

nitrilotriacetates, ethylene-diamine tetrapropionates, triethyleneterraaminehexacetates, diethylenetriaminepentaacetates, ethylenediaminedisuccinates and ethanol diglycines. The alkali metal salts of these materials are preferred.<br>
Amino phosphonates are also suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of this invention when at least low levels of total phosphorus are permitted in detergent compositions, and include ethylenediaminetetrakis (methylene-<br><br>
phosphonates) as DEQUES!. Preferably, these amino phosphonates do not contain alkyl or alkenyl groups with more than about 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Preferred chelating agents include hydroxy-ethyldiphosphonic acid (HEDP), diethylene triamine penta acetic acid (DTPA), ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) and dipicolinic acid (DPA) and salts thereof.

The chelating agent, if employed, can comprise from about 0.1% to 4% by weight of the compositions herein. More preferably, the chelating agent will<br>
comprise from about 0.2% to 2% by weight of the detergent compositions herein. Optional Thickening, Viscosity Control and/or Dispersing ARents<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain a polymeric material which serves to enhance the ability of the composition to maintain its solid particulate components in suspension. Such materials may thus act as thickeners, viscosity control agents and/or dispersing agents. Such materials are frequently polymeric polycarboxylates but can include other polymeric materials such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or polyamide resins.<br>
Polymeric polycarboxylate materials can be prepared by polymerizing or copolymerizing suitable unsaturated monomers, preferably in their acid form. Unsaturated monomeric acids that can be polymerized to form suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, cirraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The presence in the polymeric polycarboxylates herein of monomeric segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight of the polymer.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid.   The average molecular weight of such polymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 100,000, more preferably from about 2,000 to 10,000, even more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000, and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000.    Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued March 7, 1967.  Such materials may also perform a builder function.<br><br>
If utilized, the optional thickening, viscosity control and/or dispersing agents should be present in the compositions herein to the extent of from about 0.1% to 4% by weight. More preferably, such materials can comprise from about 0.5% to 2% by weight of the detergents compositions herein. Optional Clay Soil Removal/Anti-redeposition Agents<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also optionally contain water-soluble ethoxylated amines having clay soil removal and anti-redeposition properties. If used, soil materials can contain from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of the compositions herein.<br>
The  most   preferred   soil  release   and   anti-redeposition   agent   is   ethoxylated tetraethylenepentamine.    Exemplary ethoxylated amines are further described in U.S. Patent 4,597,898, VanderMeer, issued July 1, 1986. Another group of preferred clay soil removal-anti-redeposition agents are the cationic compounds disclosed  in European Patent Application 111,965, Oh and Gosselink, published June 27, 1984.   Other clay soil removal/anti-redeposition agents which  can be used include the  ethoxylated  amine polymers disclosed in European Patent Application 111,984, Gosselink, published June 27, 1984; the zwirterionic polymers disclosed in European Patent Application 112,592, Gosselink, published July 4,  1984; and the amine oxides disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,548,744, Connor, issued October 22,  1985.    Other clay soil removal and/or anti-redeposition agents known in the art can also be utilized in the compositions herein. Another type of preferred anti-redeposition agent includes the carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) materials. These materials are well known in the art.<br>
Peroxygen Bleaching Agent With Optional Bleach Activators Peroxygen bleaching agents may be organic or inorganic in nature.    Inorganic peroxygen  bleaching agents are frequently  utilized  in  combination  with  a  bleach activator.<br>
Useful organic peroxygen bleaching agents include percarboxylic acid bleaching agents and salts thereof.   Suitable examples of this class of agents include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, the magnesium salt of rnetachloro perbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid.   Such bleaching agents are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,483,781, Hartman, Issued November 20, 1984; European Patent Application EP-A-133,354, Banks et al., Published February 20, 1985; and U.S. Patent 4,412,934, Chung et al., Issued November 1, 1983.   Highly preferred bleaching agents  also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic  acid  (NAPAA) as described in U.S. Patent 4,634,551, Issued January 6, 1987 to Burns et al.<br><br>
Inorganic  peroxygen   bleaching  agents   may   also   be   used   in   the   detergent compositions herein.   Inorganic bleaching agents are in fact preferred.   Such inorganic peroxygen compounds include alkali metal perborate and percarbonate materials, most preferably the percarbonates.    For example, sodium perborate (e.g. mono- or tetra-hydrate) can be used.   Suitable inorganic bleaching agents can also include sodium or potassium carbonate peroxyhydrate and equivalent  "percarbonate" bleaches,  sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, and sodium peroxide.     Persulfate bleach (e.g.,  OXONE,  manufactured commercially by DuPont) can also be used. Frequently inorganic peroxygen bleaches will be coated with silicate, borate, sulfate or water-soluble surfactants.  For example, coated percarbonate particles are available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay Interox, Tokai Denka and Degussa.<br>
Inorganic peroxygen bleaching agents, e.g., the perborates, the percarbonates, etc., are preferably combined with bleach activators, which lead to the in situ production in aqueous    solution    (i.e.,    during    use    of   the    compositions    herein    for    fabric laundering/bleaching) of the peroxy acid corresponding to the bleach activator.  Various non-limiting examples of activators are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,915,854, Issued April 10, 1990 to Mao et al.; and U.S. Patent 4,412,934 Issued November 1, 1983 to Chung et al. The nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS) and terraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) activators are typical.    Mixtures thereof can also be used. See also the hereinbefore referenced U.S. 4,634,551 for other typical bleaches and activators useful herein. Other useful amido-derived bleach activators are those of the formulae:<br>
R1N(R5)C(O)R2C(O)L	or     R1C(O)N(R5)R2C(O)L<br>
wherein R1 is an alkyl group containing from about 6 to about 12 carbon atoms, R2 is an alkylene containing from 1 to about 6 carbon atoms, R^ is H or alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is any suitable leaving group, for example, oxybenzene sulfonate, -OOH, -OOM. A leaving group is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of the nucleophilic attack on the bleach activator by the perhydrolysis anion. A preferred leaving group is phenol sulfonate.<br>
Preferred examples of bleach activators of the above formulae include (6-octanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate, (6-nonanamidocaproyl) oxybenzenesulfonate, (6-decanamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate and mixtures thereof as described in the hereinbefore referenced U.S. Patent 4,634,551. Such mixtures are characterized herein as (6-C8-C10 alkamido-caproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate.<br><br>
Another class of useful bleach activators comprises the benzoxazin-type activators disclosed by Hodge et al. in U.S. Patent 4,966, 723, Issued October 30, 1990, incorporated herein by reference. A highly preferred activator of the benzoxazin-type is:<br><br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Still another class of useful bleach activators includes the acyl lactam activators, especially acyl caprolactams and acyl valerolactams of the formulae:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

If peroxygen bleaching agents are used, they will generally comprise from about 0.1% to 30% by weight of the composition. More preferably, peroxygen bleaching agent will comprise from about 1 % to 20% by weight of the composition. Most preferably, peroxygen bleaching agent will be present to the extent of from about 5% to 20% by weight of the composition. If utilized, bleach activators can comprise from about 0.5% to 20%, more preferably from about 3% to 10%, by weight of the composition. Frequently, activators are employed such that the molar ratio of bleaching agent to activator ranges from about 1:1 to 10:1, more preferably from about 1.5:1 to 5:1.<br>
In addition, it has been found that bleach activators, when agglomerated with certain acids such as citric acid, are more chemically stable. Optional Bleach Catalysts<br>
If desired, the bleaching compounds can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,246,621, U.S. Pat. 5,244,594; U.S.<br><br>

As a practical matter, and  not by way of limitation,  the compositions and processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per ten million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing liquor, and will preferably provide from about 0. 1 ppm to about 700 ppm, more preferably from about 1 ppm to about 500 ppm, of the catalyst species in the laundry liquor.<br>
Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg. Mech... (1983), 2, pages 1-94.

These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in the Tobe article and the references cited therein, in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, J. Chem. Ed. (1989), 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; Inorg. Chem., 18, 1497-1502 (1979); InorR. Chem.. 21, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176 (1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry, 56, 22-25 (1952).<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of<br><br>

If present, brighteners suds suppressors, dyes and/or perfumes will typically comprise from about 0.0001% to 2% by weight of the compositions herein. Polymeric Soil Release Agent<br>
Any polymeric soil release agent known to those skilled in the art can optionally be employed in the compositions and processes of this invention. Polymeric soil release agents are characterized by having both hydrophilic segments, to hydrophilize the surface of hydrophobic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, and hydrophobic segments, to deposit upon hydrophobic fibers and remain adhered thereto through completion of washing and rinsing cycles and, thus, serve as an anchor for the hydrophilic segments. This can enable stains occurring subsequent to treatment with the soil release agent to be more easily cleaned in later washing procedures.<br>
Examples  of polymeric  soil release  agents useful  herein  include  U.S.  Patent 4,721,580,  issued  January 26,   1988  to  Gosselink;     U.S.  Patent  4,000,093,  issued December 28, 1976 to Nicol, et al; European Patent Application 0 219 048, published April 22,  1987 by Kud, et al.; U.S. Patent 4,702,857, issued October 27,  1987 to Gosselink;   U.S.   Patent   4,968,451,   issued   November   6,   1990   to   JJ.

Another type of preferred antiredeposition agent includes the carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) materials. These materials are well known in the art. Polymeric Dispersing Agents<br>
Polymeric dispersing agents can advantageously be utilized at levels from about 0.1% to about 7%, by weight, in the compositions herein, especially in the presence of zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Suitable polymeric dispersing agents include polymeric polycarboxylates and polyethylene glycols, although others known in the art can also be used. It is believed, though it is not intended to be limited by theory, that polymeric dispersing agents enhance overall detergent builder performance, when used in combination with other builders (including lower molecular weight polycarboxylates) by crystal growth inhibition, particulate soil release peptization, and anti-redeposition.<br>
Polymeric   polycarboxylate   materials   can   be   prepared   by   polymerizing   or copolymerizing   suitable   unsaturated   monomers,   preferably   in   their   acid   form. Unsarurated monomeric acids that can be polymerized  to  form  suitable polymeric polycarboxylates include acrylic acid, maleic acid (or maleic anhydride), fumaric acid, itaconic acid, aconitic acid, mesaconic acid, citraconic acid and methylenemalonic acid. The  presence  in  the  polymeric  polycarboxylates  herein   or  monomeric   segments, containing no carboxylate radicals such as vinylmethyl ether, styrene, ethylene, etc. is suitable provided that such segments do not constitute more than about 40% by weight.<br>
Particularly suitable polymeric polycarboxylates can be derived from acrylic acid. Such acrylic acid-based polymers which are useful herein are the water-soluble salts of polymerized acrylic acid. The average molecular weight 'of such polymers in the acid<br><br>
form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to 10,000, more preferably from about 4,000 to 7,000 and most preferably from about 4,000 to 5,000. Water-soluble salts of such acrylic acid polymers can include, for example, the alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble polymers of this type are known materials. Use of polyacrylates of this type in detergent compositions has been disclosed, for example, in Diehl, U.S. Patent 3,308,067, issued march 7, 1967.<br>
Acrylic/maleic-based copolymers may also be used as a preferred component of the dispersing/anti-redeposition agent.    Such materials include the water-soluble salts of copolymers of acrylic acid and maleic acid.    The average molecular weight of such copolymers in the acid form preferably ranges from about 2,000 to   100,000, more preferably from about 5,000 to 75,000, most preferably from about 7,000 to 65,000.  The ratio of acrylate to maleate segments in such copolymers will generally range from about 30:1 to about 1:1, more preferably from about 10:1 to 2:1.   Water-soluble salts of such acrylic  acid/maleic   acid  copolymers   can   include,   for   example,   the   alkali   metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Soluble acrylate/maleate copolymers of this type are known materials which are described in European Patent Application No. 66915, published December 15, 1982, as well as in EP 193,360, published September 3, 1986, which also describes such polymers comprising hydroxypropylacrylate.  Still other useful dispersing agents include the maleic/acrylic/vinyl alcohol terpolymers.   Such materials are also disclosed in EP 193,360, including, for example, the 45/45/10 terpolymer of acrylic/maleic/vinyl alcohol.<br>
Another polymeric material which can be included is polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG can exhibit dispersing agent performance as well as act as a clay soil removal-antiredeposition agent. Typical molecular weight ranges for these purposes range from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 50,000, more preferably from about 1,500 to about 10,000.<br>
Polyaspartate and polyglutamate dispersing agents may also be used, especially in conjunction with zeolite builders.   Dispersing agents such as polyaspartate preferably have a molecular weight (avg.) of about 10,000. Dye Transfer Inhibiting Agents<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also include one or more materials effective for inhibiting the transfer of dyes from one fabric to another during the cleaning process. Generally, such dye transfer inhibiting agents include polyvinyl pyrrolidone polymers, polyamine N-oxide polymers, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole, manganese phthalocyanine, peroxidases, and mixtures thereof. If used, these agents typically comprise from about 0.01% to about 10% by weight of the<br><br>
composition, preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and more preferably from about<br>
0.05% to about 2%.<br>
More specifically, the polyamine N-oxide polymers preferred for use herein contain<br>
units having the following structural formula: R-AX-P; wherein P is a polymerizable unit<br>
to which an N-O group can be attached or the N-O group  can form part of the polymerizable unit or the N-O group can be attached to both units; A is one of the following structures: -NC(O)-, -C(O)O-, -S-, -O-, -N=; x is 0 or 1; and R is aliphatic, ethoxylated aliphatics, aromatics, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or any combination thereof to which the nitrogen of the N-O group can be attached or the N-O group is part of these groups.   Preferred polyamine N-oxides are those wherein R is a heterocyclic group such as pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrrolidine, piperidine and derivatives thereof. The N-O group can be represented by the following general structures:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 are aliphatic, aromatic, heterocyclic or alicyclic groups or combinations thereof; x, y and z are 0 or 1 ; and the nitrogen of the N-O group can be attached or form part of any of the aforementioned groups. The amine oxide unit of the polyamine N-oxides has a pKa 
Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties. Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof. These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10: 1 to 1:1,000,000.   However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation.     The polyamine  oxides  can  be obtained  in  almost any degree of polymerization.   Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000.    This preferred class of materials can be referred to as "PVNO".<br>
The most preferred polyamine N-oxide useful in the detergent compositions herein is poly(4-vinylpyridine-N-oxide) which as an average molecular weight of about 50,000 and an amine to amine N-oxide ratio of about 1 :4.<br><br>
Copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and N-vinylimidazole polymers (referred to as a class as "PVPVI") are also preferred for use herein. Preferably the PVPVI has an average molecular weight range from 5,000 to 1,000,000, more preferably from 5,000 to 200,000, and most preferably from 10,000 to 20,000.    (The average molecular weight range is determined by light scattering as described in Earth, et al., Chemical Analysis, Vol 113. "Modern   Methods   of  Polymer   Characterization",   the   disclosures   of   which   are incorporated herein by reference.) The PVPVI copolymers typically have a molar ratio of N-vinylimidazole to N-vinylpyrrolidone from 1:1 to 0.2:1, more preferably from 0.8:1 to 0.3:1, most preferably from 0.6:1 to 0.4:1.   These copolymers can be either linear or branched.<br>
The present  invention  compositions   also  may  employ  a polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") having an average molecular weight of from about 5,000 to about 400,000, preferably from about 5,000 to about 200,000, and more preferably from about 5,000 to about 50,000. PVP's are known to persons skilled in the detergent field; see, for example, EP-A-262,897 and EP-A-256,696, incorporated herein by reference.     Compositions containing PVP  can also  contain polyethylene glycol  ("PEG") having  an average molecular weight from about 500 to about 100,000, preferably from about 1,000 to about 10,000.  Preferably, the ratio of PEG to PVP on a ppm basis delivered in wash solutions is from about 2:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 3:1 to about 10:1.<br>
The detergent compositions herein may also optionally contain from about 0.005% to 5% by weight of certain types of hydrophilic optical brighteners which also provide a dye transfer inhibition action. If used, the compositions herein will preferably comprise from about 0.01% to 1% by weight of such optical brighteners.<br>
The hydrophilic optical brighteners useful in the present invention are those having the structural formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal-UNPA-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation. Tinopal-UNPA-GX is the preferred hydrophilic optical brightener useful in the detergent compositions herein.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is N-2-hydroxyethyl-N-2-<br>
methylamino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-(N-<br>
2-hydroxyethyl-N-methylamino)-s-triazine-2-yl)arnino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic	acid<br>
disodium salt.   This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal 5BM-GX by Ciba-Geigy Corporation.<br>
When in the above formula, R1 is anilino, R2 is morphilino and M is a cation such as sodium, the brightener is 4,4'-bis[(4-anilino-6-morphilino-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid, sodium salt. This particular brightener species is commercially marketed under the tradename Tinopal AMS-GX by Ciba Geigy Corporation.<br>
The specific optical brightener species selected for use in the present invention provide especially effective dye transfer inhibition performance benefits when used in combination with the selected polymeric dye transfer inhibiting agents hereinbefore described.   The combination of such selected polymeric materials (e.g., PVNO and/or PVPVI) with such selected optical brighteners (e.g., Tinopal UNPA-GX, Tinopal 5BM-GX and/or Tinopal AMS-GX) provides significantly better dye transfer inhibition in aqueous wash solutions than does either of these two detergent composition components when used alone.   Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such brighteners work this way because they have high affinity for fabrics in the wash solution and therefore deposit relatively quick on these fabrics.    The extent to which brighteners deposit on fabrics in the wash solution can be defined by a parameter called the "exhaustion coefficient".   The exhaustion coefficient is in general as the ratio of a) the brightener material deposited on fabric to b) the initial brightener concentration in the wash liquor.    Brighteners with relatively high exhaustion coefficients are the most suitable for inhibiting dye transfer in the context of the present invention.<br>
Of course, it will be appreciated that other, conventional optical brightener types of compounds can optionally be used in the present compositions to provide conventional fabric "brightness" benefits, rather than a true dye transfer inhibiting effect.   Such usage is conventional and well-known to detergent formulations. COMPOSITION FORM<br>
The aqueous based heavy-duty liquid detergent compositions disclosed herein can contain water and other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those<br><br>
containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and 1,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contain from 5% to 90%, typically 10% to 50% of such carriers.<br>
The detergent compositions herein will preferably be formulated such that, during use in aqueous cleaning operations, the wash water will have a pH of between about 6.5 and about 11, preferably between about 7.5 and 11. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage levels include the use of buffers, alkalis, acids, etc., and are well known to those skilled in the art. COMPOSITION PREPARATION AND USE<br>
The aqueous based heavy-duty liquid detergent compositions of the present invention can be made by mixing and blending the desired ingredients with the desired sovent. In a typical process for preparing such compositions, essential and certain preferred optional components will be combined in a particular order and under certain conditions.<br>

(alkylbenzene mixture according to the invention)<br>
110.25 g of the substantially mono methyl branched olefin mixture of example 2, 36.75 g of a nonbranched olefin mixture (decene : undecene : dodecene : tridecene ratio of 2 : 9 : 20 : 18)   and 36 g of a shape selective zeolite catalyst (acidic beta zeolite catalyst; Zeocatâ¢ PB/H) are added to a 2 gallon stainless steel, stirred autoclave.  Residual olefin and catalyst in the container are washed into the autoclave with 300 mL of n-hexane and the autoclave is sealed. From outside the autoclave cell, 2000 g of benzene (contained in a isolated vessel and added by way of an isolated pumping system inside the isolated autoclave cell) is added to the autoclave.   The autoclave is purged twice with 250 psig N2, and then charged to 60 psig N2.   The mixture is stirred and heated to about 200Â°C for about 4-5 hours. The autoclave is cooled to about 20Â°C overnight.    The valve is opened leading from the autoclave to the benzene condenser and collection tank.   The<br><br>
autoclave is heated to about 120Â°C with continuous collection of benzene. No more benzene is collected by the time the reactor reaches 120Â°C. The reactor is then cooled to 40Â°C and 750 g of n-hexane is pumped into the autoclave with mixing. The autoclave is then drained to remove the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is filtered to remove catalyst and the n-hexane is removed under vacuum. The product is distilled under vacuum (1-5 mm of Hg). A modified alkylbenzene mixture with a 2/3-Phenyl index of about 200 and a 2-methyl-2-phenyl index of about 0.02 is collected from 76Â°C - 130Â°C (167 g).<br>
