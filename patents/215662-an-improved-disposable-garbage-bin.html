				<td>The   present invention relates to an improved Garbage<br>
More  particularly,  this  invention  relates dispasable <br>
to  an<br>
improved garbage bin suitable for use in city, towns and public places, where large quantity of garbage are generated every day. Thus collected garbage are unloaded from the bins and carried to general garbage disposal site located elsewhere.<br>
In the developed countries solid waste management and control is viewed seriously under stringent state-laws. The prior art of the countries reveal basic development in transporting, shedding, sorting, compacting, grinding, incineration and its disposal. As such, hitherto known outdoor garbage bins are mostly of simple containers of different sizes and shapes suitable for either manually handling or hydraulically lifting, meant for transporting for further treatment like sorting, shedding, compacting, grinding incineration and disposal. It has been reported in Pollution Engineering Hand Book, industrial waste, similar container mounted on trailer are suitable for use inside building".<br>
There is a patent on disposable container, applicant, .,-M/s. Frontier Plastic (South Wales) Ltd., inventors/ J. HARRIS; J.E. ANTHONY, Indian Patent No. 173486.. It describes a disposable plastic container suitable for medical refuse for indoor hospital use. It is basically a cubical container with a top slanting door with a lid operates on counter weight system. When the container is full, the same may be completely sealed for disposal to incinerate.<br>
This type of disposable container is not suitable  for out door use. It is limited in size and as such cannot hold<br><br>
larger quantity of garbage generated in public place outdoor. If the same container is made bigger, handling and emptying the garbage will be very cumbersome like other ordinary containers. Moreover, this disposable container is basically meant for indoor hospital use and must be incinerated only, otherwise the container itself will pose as a pollution hazard.<br>
In India, hitherto known out door garbage bins are either metallic or masonry work consists of floor and four walls with or without cover at top. One of the walls have an entrance opening for dumping and discharging of garbage. These garbage bins or dumping yards have many drawbacks. Primarily stray animals like dog, cow, enter to these garbage yards in search of food and scatter the litters around the entrance making it further unusable by users. Secondly, to unload the garbage from these bins are labour<br>
intensive. Moreover, worker emptying these bins have to work with spade, balsa etc. to unload from garbage bin to load the garbage carrying trucks or trailer.<br>
There are certain types of out door garbage bins usually of round or rectangular box made of metal or plastic or similar material. Though these bins are inaccessible to animals they have some drawbacks. Since these vessels are unloaded by tilting the vessels, they are always limited in size to enable handling. As such their holding capacity is very less and a good number of such vessels are required for meeting the garbage generated. Moreover lifting and collecting of garbage are have same cumbersome process of manual handling of garbage by labourers.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved garbage bin with novel features like inclined tiltable bottom plates, front door for unloading which will not require direct handling of garbage and thereby avoid direct contact of unhygienic garbage by labourers for unloading the garbage.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a garbage bin which will be inaccessible to stray animals.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a garbage bin which can be used to directly unload the garbage to the carrier or trailer meant for garbage carrying.<br>
An embodiment of the improved garbage bin of the present invention is shown in the drawings accompanying this specification.<br>
Fig. \ (a) "'shows the Plan &amp; Fig.-i4b)- shows the Elevation with details of parts of the improved garbage bin of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the side elevation of the improved garbage bin with details.<br>
As illustrated in the Figs.l &amp; 2, the garbage bin (1) comprises of 4 walls, the front of which is a door (11) hinged at hinges (9). The door is locked by latches (10) and with a handle (16). The bottom plate (3) placed inclined is hinged at (4) and supported at (7) on an angle structure. It is also provided with two handles (6) and operates between<br><br>
The slits (15) is fabricated by placing angles vertically along the height of the wall and the slits (17) provided on the wall . This bottom tillable plate (3) is either made of metal or PVC or plastic is supported appropriately on angle iron frame (5) . The whole bin is supported on a steel structure (2) and provided with steps (12) for users facility. The same structure is over hanged at (18) and of suitable height to enable a garbage trailer (13) to move freely for unloading the garbage. When the door (11) is opened and bottom plate (3) is tilted with the handle (6) manually, the garbage glides down directly to the trailer (13). The garbage bin (1) is covered with a cover plate (14) either welded or bolted to bin with suitable inclination and with an opening (19) for dumping garbage to the garbage bin.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved disposable garbage bin which comprises an enclosure having fixed walls on three sides and a door in front with appropriate means for hinge support and for locking the enclosure being provided with a floor having bottom supporting plate hinged horizontally at the front door bottom end and provided with means to enable the said bottom plate to be inclined, the top of the said enclosure being provided with a lid having an opening. In an embodiment of the present invention the bin may be supported on a structure of suitable height with steps and platform towards back. In another embodiment of the present invention the bottom hinged iltableplate may be operated manually, mechanically, hydraulically with suitable available<br><br>
equipment.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention provides a suitable structure for placing the bin or a monolithic structure of masonry work along with three side walls with suitable steps &amp; platform for easy disposal of garbage to the garbage bin.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the front door portion remains overhung suitably at an appropriate height in such a manner so as to enable easy access of a garbage carrying trailer/vehicle.<br>
The main advantages of the improved garbage bin of the present invention are :-<br>
(1)	By opening the front door and tilting the inclined<br>
bottom plate, the garbage can be directly dumped to<br>
trailer which avoids contact of unhygienic garbage<br>
materials to the labourers.<br>
(2)	The suitable height of the structure on which the<br>
garbage bin is placed will eliminate the problem of<br>
scattering of garbage by the stray animals.<br>
(3)	The present arrangement of the garbage bin will be less<br>
labour intensive and can suitably be mechanised to<br>
operate according to necessity.<br>
(4)	The whole arrangement gives a good look by enclosing<br>
garbage in a closed bin and keeps the surrounding<br>
clean.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim :<br>
1.	An improved disposable garbage bin which comprises an enclosure<br>
having fixed walls on three sides and a door in front with appropriate<br>
means for hinge support and for locking the enclosure being provided<br>
with a floor having bottom supporting plate hinged horizontally at the<br>
front door bottom end and provided with means to enable the said<br>
bottom plate to be inclined, the top of the said enclosure being<br>
provided with a lid having an opening.<br>
2.	An improved garbage bin as claimed in claim 1 wherein the bin is<br>
supported on a structure of suitable height with steps and platform<br>
towards back.<br>
3.	An improved garbage bin as claimed in claims 1 to 4 wherein the front<br>
door portion remains overhung suitably at an appropriate height in<br>
such a manner so as to enable easy access of a garbage carrying<br>
trailer/vehicle.<br>
4.	An  improved garbage bin substantially as herein described with<br>
reference to the drawings accompanying this specification.<br></td>
