The present invention relates to a novel system for detection<br>
and classification of power/transmission line faults. More<br>
particularly this invention pertains to a digital relay based on<br>
frequency domain approach for detection and classification of<br>
power system transmission line faults employing wavelet multi<br>
resolution analysis (hereinafter referred to as *MRA/ for the<br>
sake of brevity) to overcome the difficulties associated with<br>
conventional voltage and current-based measurements due to the<br>
effect of factors like, inter alia, fault inception angle, fault<br>
impedance and fault distance. The wavelet transform devised and<br>
effectively applied in the novel system of the subject invention<br>
captures the dynamic characteristics of the non-stationary<br>
transient fault signals using wavelet MRA coefficients, thereby<br>
enabling a transmission line of 100 km in length representing the<br>
EHV transmission, wherein by application of software developed<br>
for this purpose in accordance with this invention it has been<br>
possible to detect and classify accurately the different types of<br>
power system faults.<br>
Earlier electromechanical relays were used for transmission<br>
line protection. These had several drawbacks such as high burden<br>
on instrument transformers, longer operating time, contact<br>
problems, etc. Solid-state relays which avoid most of these<br>
difficulties were gradually replacing electromagneting relays.<br>
Though successfully used, these suffer from a number of<br>
disadvantages like inflexibility, duplication of specification<br>
efforts, and inadaptability to changing system conditions,<br>
complexity and cost. Software (digital) scheme avoid most of<br>
these difficulties. Programmable equipment can respond faster<br><br>
and may be used to implement complex threshold characteristics at<br>
low cost. They can also be self-checking in nature thereby<br>
requiring less maintenance and providing greater reliability.<br>
Conventional relaying scheme usually work based on the<br>
magnitudes of current signals where the fundamental component of<br>
fault currents in time-domain is compared with the preset nominal<br>
values. Hence these relays fail to operate during fault currents<br>
with low magnitudes. On the other hand, frequency domain analysis<br>
of fault currents checks for the presence of harmonics in current<br>
waveforms which appear during fault conditions due to abrupt<br>
change of current magnitude. Thus, by applying frequency domain<br>
analysis, faults can be easily detected and classified even in<br>
cases of low fault current in case of arcing faults, where<br>
conventional relays fail to operate. Many of the fault<br>
classification algorithms are mostly developed for shunt faults<br>
having low impedance (non-arcing faults). But distance relays<br>
fail to operate during high impedance faults due to under reach.<br>
As the transient disturbances are quite low during high impedance<br>
faults, relays based on current measurements do not distinguish<br>
the fault conditions from normal conditions as the fault current<br>
will not be considerably high.<br>
The present invention aims at overcoming the difficulties<br>
envisaged in the conventional methods.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a novel<br>
system for detection and classification of power transmission<br>
line faults.<br><br>
A further object of this invention is to develop an algorithm for detection and<br>
classification of transmission line faults using wavelet MRA with Daubechies-four (referred<br>
to herein as Db-4) wavelet based on measurements and comparison of sharp variation in the<br>
values of the currents for the three phases in the sixth stage MRA detail signals extracted<br>
from the original line faults and read on the host computer with monitor.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a system using an algorithm in<br>
conjunction with components/equipments which takes into account the effects of factors<br>
like fault inception angle, fault impedance and fault distance while detecting and classifying<br>
the nature of transmission line fault(s).<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a system using an algorithm based on<br>
wavelet transform capable of capturing dynamic characteristics of non-stationary signal<br>
using short-data window, efficiently analyzing the signals having transients or discontinuities,<br>
e.g. the post-fault voltage/current waveform.<br>
The foregoing objects are achieved by the present invention which relates to a novel<br>
system for detection and classification of a novel system for detection and classification of<br>
power system transmission line faults having the undernoted principal components -<br>
(a) power supply source, (b) a transmission line model for 100 km length including 10 watts<br>
per phase load, (c) switching circuit for incorporating fault inception angle (FIS), (d) data<br>
acquisition system and digital cathode ray oscilloscope (CRO) and (e) computer, character-<br>
ized in that -<br>
(i) a three phase variac [ rating: 440V / 0 - 470V, 50 Hz ] is connected to the three<br>
phase main supply;<br>
(ii) output of three phase variac is connected to 3-phase isolation transformer<br>
[ rating: 440V / 20V (line to line voltage) and 180 VA ];<br>
(iii) output of the isolation transformer is connected to the 100 km transmission line<br>
model;<br><br>
(v) presence of star connected 1 Ow bulb load (per phase) causes the current to pass<br>
from 0 km to 100 km of the transmission line model; and<br>
(vi) the DAQ card and digital CRO monitor the three phase currents at the Oth km<br>
of the transmission line model.<br>
Brief theoretical background of the invention :<br>
The continuous WT (CWT) of a signal x (t) is defined as -<br>
I <br>
where l//(t) is the mother wavelet and other wavelets <br>
are its dilated and translated versions, a and b are the dilation parameter and the translation<br>
parameters respectively. In general, the mother wavelet is compactly supported in both time-<br>
domain and frequency-domain, which, together with the dilation and translation operations,<br>
provides variable time-frequency resolution ability for different frequencies.<br>
The discrete WT (DWT), instead of CWT, is always used in practice. For a signal x (t),<br>
its DWT coefficient with respect to a discrete weavelet y/mn can be represented by<br><br>
where is defined by<br><br>
For some special choices of If/, aQ and bQ, {lf/ma, m,n eZ} constitute an orthonormal<br>
basis of L2 (i?) (the space of finite-energy functions). The most frequently used selections are<br>
a0 =2 and b0 = 1. A signal x (t) can then be represented by its DWT coefficients as<br><br><br>
The function, Iff (t) itself is called the mother wavelet<br>
which in this case is the Db-4 wavelet. The output of the DWT<br>
consists of the remaining "approximation" components, and all of<br>
the accumulated "detail" components.<br>
The actual implementation of DWT is done by multi-resolution<br>
analysis (MRA). By using MRA a signal can be analyzed at different<br>
frequency bands with different resolutions. The signal to be<br>
analyzed is decomposed into a smooth approximation and a detail.<br>
The approximation is further decomposed into an approximation<br>
and detail and the process is repeated. The decomposition of the<br>
signal is obtained by successive high pass and low pass filtering<br>
of the time domain signal. The successive stages of decomposition<br>
are known as levels and the above procedure is known as sub-band<br>
coding. The approximation and details at level-1 and level-2 have<br>
been represented using suffixes al and a2. The MRA details at<br>
various levels contain the features for detection and classification<br>
of faults.<br>
Owing to the unique feature of providing multi-resolution<br>
both in time and frequency by wavelets, the sub-band information<br>
can be extracted from the original signal. Thus for transmission<br>
line fault analysis in a power system, applied to faults, these<br>
sub-band informations are seen to provide useful clues regarding<br>
the faults for their classification in an elegant way. The<br>
generated time domain signal for each case is analyzed using<br>
Wavelet transform. Amongst different decomposed levels, only 6th<br>
level detail coefficients of current signals is considered for<br>
the analysis, because the absolute values of the summation of 6th<br>
level detail coefficients of current signals for all inception<br><br>
angles considered for the analysis are found to be higher as<br>
compared to those from other level output. It indicates that<br>
total area under the characteristics of 6th level outputs is more<br>
than that of other level outputs. Another reason for the 6th<br>
level output to be selected as the parameter for fault<br>
classification is that the summation of 6th level detail<br>
coefficients of current signals satisfies the characteristic<br>
relationships for all types of faults for classification purposes.<br>
Thus based on sixth level detail coefficients of current signals,<br>
an efficient generalized algorithm for fault classification based<br>
on the Wavelet analysis is depicted below.<br>
The transmission line faults in a power system are usually<br>
classified as single line to ground (L-G), double line to ground<br>
(L-L-G), double line (L-L), and 3 phase symmetrical (L-L-L) and<br>
(L-L-L-G) faults. The fault inception angle has a considerable<br>
effect on the phase current samples and therefore also on wavelet<br>
transforms output of post-fault signals as confirmed from several<br>
simulation studies. As the waves are periodic, it is sufficient<br>
to study the effect of inception angle in the range of 0° to 180°.<br>
The algorithm proceeds as follows :<br>
Let S , S. and S be the summation of sixth level detail<br>
a a	c<br>
coefficients values for current in phases a, b and c, respectively.<br>
When the summation of S , Sw and S is equal to zero, then the<br>
a' b c ^<br>
fault can be either L-L-L or L-L fault. The discrimination<br>
between these two types of faults is based on the fact that the<br>
magnitudes of Sa, Sb and S are comparable to each other. In case<br>
of L-L fault, the addition of any two phases summations namely,<br>
either S +S. or SK+S„ or S +S tends to nearly equal to zero and<br><br>
remaining phase summation coefficient is very small and almost<br>
negligible compared to other two summations having equal values<br>
with opposite signs. If the above condition is not satisfied,<br>
then it is considered as L-L-L fault.<br>
When the summation of Sa, Sb and Sc is not equal to zero, then<br>
it can be either L-G or L-L-G fault- If the absolute value of any<br>
two coefficients is equal and always much smaller than the<br>
absolute value of the remaining coefficients, then it is a L-G<br>
fault. If the absolute value of any two coefficients is not equal<br>
to zero and is always much higher than the absolute value of<br>
remaining coefficients, then it is a L-L-G fault.<br>
Sequence of steps for calculation of Sa, S^ and Sc :<br>
The following steps are incorporated to obtain the wavele|t<br>
summation coefficients S , S. and S„ :<br>
a* o c<br>
1.	The fault currents of each phase are measured continuously.<br>
2.	These fault currents are then sampled with a sampling frequency<br>
of 12.5 kHz.<br>
3.	These samples are then convolved with the low-pass filter<br>
coefficients of sixth level Db-4 wavelet to obtain the<br>
detail coefficients.<br>
4.	The obtained coefficients from the above step are summed up<br>
to get the wavelet summation coefficients Sa, Sb and Sc for<br>
the three phase currents la, lb and Ic, respectively.<br>

With regard Fig.lA, this is a schematic diagram of<br>
'Approximation' and 'detailed' components on the basis of the<br>
output of the DWT. As shown therein, the input current signal is<br>
split into its high and low frequency components. Hence at the<br>
sixth level, since the high frequency components fall in the<br>
range of 97.65 Hz to 195.31 Hz within which the 2nd and 3rd order<br>
harmonics lie, these co-efficients are considered for further<br><br>
analysis.<br>
As would be discussed in detail hereafter, the wavelet block<br>
in LABVIEW software including classification algorithm shown<br>
Fig.IB computes discrete wavelet transform and supports the<br>
waveform data, taking into account the most used wavelets. The<br>
output of this signal is made to pass another virtual instrument<br>
(also referred to herein as VI for the sake of brevity) block<br>
which in turn produces the wavelet coefficient. Fig.5(a) of the<br>
drawings shows the LABVIEW implementation for computation of<br>
S , S. and S„ of discrete wavelet detail coefficient for 6th level<br>
a b c<br>
for each of the three phase currents of transmission line.<br>
Then the output is passed into another sub-program virtual<br>
instrumentation [abbreciated herein as Sub-(VI)], as shown in<br>
Fig.5(b) of the drawings for calculation of wavelet co-efficients<br>
for one phase and it is same for remaining two phases for<br>
generating wavelet co-efficients.<br>
IMPLEMENTATION OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM<br>
USING LABVIEW SOFTWARE OF THIS INVENTION<br>
(i) Modelling of Transmission Lines<br>
A transmission line was modelled keeping in view the actual<br>
existing lines of 400KV. The main concept involved in modeling<br>
was to keep the p.u. (Per Unit) values similar and expressing<br>
with respect to a common base voltage and base KVA. At first the<br>
p.u. values of model transmission lines was determined and with<br>
help of those values and base impedance of actual system, L and<br><br>
C were determined for actual system. The values of L and C were<br>
checked with that of recorded values of actual system.<br>
Model line parameters :<br>
Base Voltage - 20V<br>
Base VA = 180VA<br>
Base Current = 5Amp<br>
Length designed for = lOOKm<br>
■*" Positive and Negative sequence parameters (per lOKm) :<br>
Resistance = 0.17 Q Inductance = 0.13195 mH<br>
Capacitance » 8.936 |iF<br>
w Negative sequence parameters (per lOKm) :<br>
Resistance = 0.08 Q Inductance = 0.4510 mH<br>
Capacitance = 6.09 jiF<br>
(ii) Three Phase Transmission Line Model - Please see Figs. 2(a)<br>
and 2(b) of the drawings.<br>
The basic scheme employs a lOOKm transmission line as<br>
shown in Figure 2(a) which consists of ten basic blocks shown in<br>
Figure 2(b). It is connected through isolating transformer which<br>
steps down to 440/20 volts supply, 50 Hz at one end meant to serve<br>
as sending end. The model line is rated at 5 Amps.<br>
At receiving end of line resistive load of around 10W (per<br><br>
phase) is connected.<br>
Faults are applied at the terminals of any module by means<br>
of switching circuit. The switching circuit shown in Figure 3<br>
creates fault at particular angle known as fault inception angle.<br>
(iii) SWITCHING CIRCUIT<br>
Faults transient studies of electrical systems require<br>
simulation of system voltage which starts its waveform from a<br>
fixed value of phase angle. Thus real time study of such system<br>
becomes difficult in mini models, network analysers and without<br>
the help of a switching unit which can control the starting point<br>
of the voltage waveform.<br>
A signal generator or frequency multiplier is used to permit<br>
one degree resolution of switching angle selector. This produces<br>
a frequency of 360f, where f is the base frequency of signal<br>
waveform that needs switching.<br>
One complete cycle = 360 degrees<br>
Frequency - 50Hz<br>
Thus a frequency of 360 X 50 = 18KHz permits one degree<br>
resolution of switching angle selector.<br>
Thus every successive zero crossing of high frequency wave<br>
corresponds to one degree angle interval of the base signal. Thus<br>
the angle sensing becomes independent of reference signal frequency.<br>
So a high frequency digital counter counts the number of zero<br><br>
crossing of high frequency wave and with the help of decoder<br>
circuit and decade switches, only a single pulse count is selected<br>
at a time for thyristor or the IGBT firing instant- This totally<br>
eliminates the possibility of wrong triggering for if the decoded<br>
pulse count fails to trigger the IGBT's, no more triggering<br>
signals are available for the control circuitry. A low frequency<br>
counter counts pulses/sec and controls the duration of the on<br>
condition of the equipment. The unit is put off by a separate<br>
relay contact which is activated from the low frequency counter.<br>
Both phase angle and duration control are performed by digital<br>
counters which are reliable and independent of supply frequency<br>
and voltage variations.<br>
(iv) SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION USING LABVIEW - See Fig.4 of the<br>
drawings.<br>
(v) Wavelet Block<br>
This computes discrete wavelet Transform and supports the<br>
waveform data and includes the most used wavelets. This output of<br>
this signal is made to pass into another VI block which is turn<br>
produces the wavelet coefficient. The subVI(l) block diagrm is as<br>
shown in Fig.5 (a) of the drawings and is also same for remaining<br>
two phase.<br>
The Figure 5(a) shows the LABVTEW implementation (sub VI<br>
diagram) for computation of discrete waveform to be used in<br>
wavelets. Then the output is passed into another Sub VI for<br>
calculation of wavelet coefficients. The second Sub VI block<br>
diagram of a phase is shown in Figure 5(b) and is same for<br><br>
remaining two phases and it generates the wavelet coefficients.<br>
The generated coefficients are checked whether their sum is<br>
zero or not. If true, then the adder checks whether the sum of two<br>
inputs is zero or not i.e. (Sa+Sb=0) or (Sb+Sc=0) or (Sc+Sa=0).<br>
Then tolerance check is done to the adder output. If again true,<br>
it will show L-L fault and if not then output is made to pass<br>
through HOT blocks which computes the negation of the input. The<br>
output signals are passed through merge block which merges two or<br>
more signals into single output which shows the<br>
L-L-L fault, Figure 5{c). But if the sum of coefficients is not<br>
zero then absolute value of input is determined and compared with<br>
another absolute value of other input i.e. |Sal = |Sbl and so on is<br>
done. If the values are equal tolerance check is done and the<br>
output is given as L-G fault or else it is L-L-G fault<br>
fFigure 5(d)]. Correspondingly, across each faults bulbs are<br>
placed and glowing of bulb represents the type of fault that has<br>
occurred,,<br>
REAL TIME IMPLEMENTATION OF FAULT DETECTION<br>
AND CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM<br>
Fig. 6 of the drawings show the set up for real time fault<br>
analysis of the transmission lines, wherein there is shown -<br>

w	Transmission line block set<br>
«•"	Switching angle circuits<br>
w*	Data acquisition system<br><w personal computer></w><br>
Experimental procedure :<br>
The three isolating transformers were fed from three phase<br>
variac and voltage was stepped down to 20V by isolating transformer<br>
which is the input to the tranmission line block. A switching<br>
circuit was used to create fault in the line. The fault inception<br>
angle has a considerable effect on the phase current samples and<br>
therefore several simulation studies were perform to obtain post<br>
fault signals. The transmission line was connected to a balanced<br>
load of 10W per phase and fault inception angle was selected by<br>
setting the single pole ten way switch and at that particular<br>
angle, a fault was created. The real time data acquisition was<br>
done through data acquisition card which is a high performance<br>
multifunctional analog to digital Input/Output board for Personal<br>
Computer.<br>
After the three current signals are acquired using data<br>
acquisition card, they are passed through LABVIEW program as<br>
shown in the Fig.4. After acquisition of the current signals, the<br>
Sa, Sb and Sc are first calculated using LABVIEW software as shown<br>
in the Fig.4 and then these values are used for classification<br>
using the same LABVIEW program.<br>
Wavelets provide the unique feature of providing multiple<br>
resolutions both in time and frequency and hence the sub-band<br>
information can be extracted from the original signal. Thus for<br>
the transmission line fault analysis in power system, applied to<br>
fault, these sub-band information has seen to provide useful<br>
clues regarding the fault for their classification in an elegant<br>
way. The generated time domain signals for each case is analyzed<br><br>
using wavelet transform. Among the several decomposed levels<br>
only the sixth level detail coefficients of current signals is<br>
considered for analysis. This is because summation of sixth level<br>
output satisfies the characteristic relationship of all types of<br>
faults for classification purposes.<br>
The wavelet algorithm was made to recognize the type of<br>
fault occuring in the system. Corresponding to every type of<br>
fault, there is one LED (light emitting diode) in the front panel<br>
of LABVTEW software. When a particular fault occurs in the<br>
system, then the signals are processed through the data acquisition<br>
system to the computer and the algorithm analysis was done to the<br>
inputted signal. Correspondingly one LED glows showing the type<br>
of fault that has occurred. Simultaneously current and voltage<br>
waveform of faulted phase and healthy phase was traced from the<br>
computer.<br>
Then in the hardware model a fault was created at about 50Km<br>
with a fault inception angle of 15°. The sigle pole 10 way switch<br>
was selected at 15° manually for fault inception angle.<br>
The currents were stepped down individually and then made to<br>
pass through data acquisition card which converts analog signal<br>
to digital signal. Then applying discrete wavelet transform to<br>
the three acquired signals, it generates the Sa, Sb, Sc coefficients<br>
which were displayed on the monitor. The coefficients were checked<br>
accordingly to determine which type of fault was occurred.<br>
For example if |sJ = |Scl &amp; «Sa, it is an L-G fault involving<br>
phase A. So when the condition was satisfied the corresponding<br><br>
LED started to glow indicating the type of fault that has occurred<br>
in the system. LABVTEW interpretation shows the type(s) of fault<br>
occurred in the system.<br>
The algorithm for fault classification reponded properly<br>
when different types of fault were given to the transmission line<br>
block.<br>
Advantages<br>

fault with consequent speedy restoration of power supply in<br>
