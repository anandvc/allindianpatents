TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]      Controlling Vapor Emission In A Small Engine Fuel Tank System.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]      The present invention relates to fuel tank systems for small engines of<br>
the type employed for portable appliances such as portable power generating<br>
sets, garden tractors, lawn mowers and other such devices where the fuel tank is<br>
either mounted on the engine or closely adjacent thereto. Fuel tanks of this type<br>
are typically refueled by removing the filler cap and pouring fuel from a container<br>
having a pouring spout, or by pouring from a container and using a funnel.<br>
[0003]      Small engine fuel systems have recently been subjected to mandated<br>
requirements for fuel vapor emission control and it has been required to prevent<br>
vapor emission from the tank during operation and when the engine is not<br>
operating.<br>
[0004]      Heretofore small engine fuel systems have often employed a tank<br>
having an open vent in the filler cap for providing make-up air in the tank as fuel<br>
was withdrawn but which permitted escape of fuel vapor to the atmosphere.<br>
[0005]      In order to meet the requirement that a fuel tank for a small engine not<br>
emit fuel vapor, the filler cap must be sealed to prevent fuel vapor emission. If<br>
the filler cap is sealed then other provisions must be made for admitting make up<br>
air to the tank during engine operation. Furthermore, provisions must be made<br>
for overpressure relief. Thus, it has been desired to find a way or means of<br>
sealing a small engine fuel tank, yet provide for make-up air and over pressure<br>
relief and to do so in a cost-effective manner without requiring redesign or<br>
retooling of the tanks.<br>
[0006]<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]      The present invention provides a fuel vapor emission control valve in<br>
the tank which controls the flow of fuel vapor through a passage extending<br>
exteriorly of the tank and also includes a rollover or upset valve preventing liquid<br>
-1 -<br>

 <br>
WO 2006/067586	PCT/IB2005/003824<br>
fuel from escaping the tank. The vapor vent valve includes a head valve which<br>
retains the vapor in the tank until a predetermined positive pressure is reached;<br>
and, the vent valve also includes a reverse flow check valve permitting make-up<br>
air to enter the tank as fuel is withdrawn or upon a sub-atmospheric pressure<br>
occurring in the tank such as, for example, by cooling of the tank. The fuel vapor<br>
vent passage may be connected externally to either a vapor storage device or the<br>
air inlet of the engine. The invention includes fitting an existing fuel tank with a<br>
filler tube extending to a predetermined level or depth in the tank to cause the fuel<br>
to rise rapidly in the filler tube upon reaching the lower end of the tube during<br>
refueling to signal the operator that tank has reached the desired fill level. This<br>
arrangement prevents overfilling and preserves a vapor dome in the tank above<br>
the liquid level of the fuel to ensure proper functioning of the vapor vent valve.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008]      FIG. 1 is a pictorial schematic showing a small engine fuel tank in<br>
cross-section with the filler tube and vapor vent valve of the present invention<br>
installed thereon; and, the connections to either a vapor storage device or<br>
alternatively the engine air inlet are shown in dashed line;<br>
[0009]      FIG. 2 is an enlarged detail of the vapor vent valve of FIG. 1;<br>
[0010]      FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a portion of FIG. 2 with the vapor vent<br>
valve closed;<br>
[0011]       FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 showing the vapor vent valve opened;<br>
and,<br>
[0012]      FIG. 5 is a view similar to FIG. 3 with the reverse flow valve shown<br>
open in response to a vacuum in the tank.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the small engine fuel tank assembly of the<br>
present invention is indicated generally at 10 and includes an existing tank wall<br>
structure 12 with a new filler tube 14 having a vapor tight removable closure 16<br>
received on the exterior end of the tube with the lower end of the tube 14<br>
extending into the tank to a desired depth or level indicated by the reference<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/067586	PCT/IB2005/003824<br>
character d.<br>
[0014]      A separate access opening 18 is formed in the upper portion of the tank<br>
wall and through which is inserted a combination rollover and vapor vent valve<br>
indicated generally at 20 which has a lower housing portion 22 extending into the<br>
tank and an upper housing portion 24 with an outwardly extending flange 26<br>
thereabout attached to the tank wall and sealed thereabout by any suitable<br>
expedient as, for example, weldment.<br>
[0015]      The lower valve housing 22 has a float 28 disposed therein with a<br>
flexible valve member 30 disposed on the upper end of the float which closes in<br>
the event that fuel rises above the level d due to sloshing, overfilling or the tank<br>
becoming severely tipped or inverted, under which conditions valve member 30<br>
seats upon a valve seat 32 formed in the upper housing 24.<br>
[0016]      The valve seat 32 is formed on the lower end of a vent passage 34<br>
which communicates with an enlarged diameter upper portion 36 which<br>
communicates with vent passage 38 which extends outwardly through attachment<br>
fitting 40 which may be formed as part of the upper housing 24.<br>
[0017]      The enlarged diameter portion 36 of the vent passage has slidably<br>
received therein a valve member 42 which has a passage 44 therethrough and<br>
which has the lower surface 46 thereof configured to seat upon surface 48 formed<br>
in the upper body at the upper end of passage 34. When the valve member 42 is<br>
in the lower position shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 5, flow through passage 34 must<br>
transit through passage 44, not the enlarged diameter passage 36.<br>
[0018]      Valve member 42 has formed therein a valving chamber 50 with a<br>
valve seat 52 formed in an inverted position therein on the lower end of the flow<br>
passage 54 which communicates with vent passage 38. Chamber 50 has<br>
received therein a check valve member 56 which may be in the form of a<br>
relatively light weight ball which may be formed of plastic and which seats on<br>
valve set 52 and closes passage 54 when a positive pressure exists in the fuel<br>
tank.<br>
[0019]      With reference to FIGS. 3, 4 and 5, it will be seen that the enlarged<br>
diameter 36, in which valve member 42 slides, has slots or passages 60 formed<br>
therein to permit passage of vapors for communication with passage 38 when the<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/067586	PCT/IB2005/003824<br>
valve member 42 is in the upward position and not seated on the seating surface<br>
48.<br>
[0020]      In operation, with the filler cap 16 removed and the tank refueled<br>
through filler tube 14, when the level of the fuel reaches the height d, with<br>
continued filling a fuel level increases rapidly in the tube 14 giving visual notice to<br>
the operator that the tank has reached the desired fill level. After refueling when<br>
the filler cap is replaced, the tank is sealed except for vent passage 38 so long as<br>
the tank is in the upright position or is not substantially tilted so as to cause float<br>
valve 30 to close on valve seat 32.<br>
[0021]      If the vapor pressure in the tank is substantially atmospheric or only<br>
slightly above, the valve member 42 is seated on seating surface 48 and only a<br>
small amount of vapor can enter the valving chamber 50 and the flow<br>
therethrough passage 44 causes ball valve 56 to seat against the seating surface<br>
52 as shown in FIG. 3 preventing escape of vapor. As the vapor pressure<br>
increases, valve member 42 is moved upwardly to the position as shown in FIG. 4<br>
permitting passage of vapor through passages 60 into the passage 38; and, as<br>
shown in FIG. 1, to either a storage device 70 or to the engine air inlet 72.<br>
[0022]      In the event that the tank is suddenly cooled and the vapor pressure in<br>
the tank drops below atmospheric, creating a vacuum in the tank, ball valve<br>
member 56 drops from its upper seat 52 allowing make-up air to enter the tank. It<br>
will be understood that this condition can also occur as fuel is withdrawn from the<br>
tank.<br>
[0023]      The present invention thus provides a simple, relatively low cost and<br>
easy to install technique for modifying an existing small engine fuel tank for<br>
control of fuel vapor emissions to meet current requirements. The invention<br>
combines a filler tube extending in the tank to maintain a vapor dome with a vapor<br>
vent control/rollover valve to prevent fuel vapor from escaping to the atmosphere<br>
upon connection to either a storage device or the engine air inlet.<br>
[0024]      Although the invention has hereinabove been described with respect to<br>
the illustrated embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is capable of<br>
modification and variation and is limited only by the following claims.<br>
