				<td>Needleless injection device with double stopper with<br>
low pressure profiles<br>
The technical field of the invention is that of<br>
prefilled, disposable needleless injection devices,<br>
operating with an energy source such as, for example, a<br>
gas generator and used for intradermal, subcutaneous<br>
and intramuscular injections of a liquid active<br>
principle for therapeutic use in human or veterinary<br>
medicine.<br>
The active principle consists of a more or less viscous<br>
liquid, a liquid mix, or a gel. The active principle<br>
may also be a solid in solution in a solvent suitable<br>
for injection, or consist of a powdery solid suspended<br>
at a certain concentration in an appropriate liquid.<br>
The particle size of the active principle must<br>
therefore be compatible with the diameter of the ducts<br>
to avoid blocking them.<br>
As used in the present application, the term 'liquid<br>
active principle' constitutes the generic definition<br>
covering all the previously mentioned embodiments of<br>
the active principle.<br>
Needleless injection devices comprising a reservoir of<br>
liquid active principle already exist in tube form and<br>
have been the subject of patents. For example, the<br>
patent application FR 2 853 837 may be cited, which<br>
relates to a needleless injection device comprising an<br>
injection nozzle and a tube intended to receive a<br>
liquid active principle to be injected, said tube being<br>
fixed to said nozzle with the help of connecting means.<br>
The person skilled in the art traditionally seeks to<br>
minimize or even eliminate the risks of damaging, on<br>
the one hand, the tube containing the liquid active<br>
principle and, on the other hand, the downstream<br>
stopper in the specific Mouble stopper' configuration<br>
 <br>
described, in particular, in the patent application<br>
WO 01/58512. Said configuration is characterized by the<br>
presence of a column of liquid delimited, on the one<br>
hand, by the side wall of the tube and, on the other<br>
hand, by an upstream stopper and a downstream stopper,<br>
between which the liquid active principle is housed.<br>
Under the effect of the gas generation, said column<br>
moves in the tube until the downstream stopper comes<br>
into contact with the base of a receptacle located in<br>
the nozzle so as to free the injection ducts in order<br>
to expel said active principle. However, when the<br>
downstream stopper hits the base of said receptacle, it<br>
creates a Shockwave that will propagate through to the<br>
tube and the intensity of which is a maximum at the end<br>
of said tube which is in contact with the nozzle. In a<br>
'double stopper' configuration, the downstream stopper<br>
and the glass tube are the two most stressed elements<br>
during the operation of the needleless injection<br>
device. The latter must consequently be shaped in such<br>
a way that the speed of impact of the downstream<br>
stopper in the receptacle is less than the limit speed<br>
acceptable for the mechanical strength of the<br>
components of said injection device. In addition, it is<br>
known that the time separating the opening of the<br>
injection ducts and the start of the output of the jet<br>
from the injection ducts must be longer than the<br>
attenuation time of the pressure oscillations generated<br>
by the opening of the injection ducts.<br>
In the technical literature of the field in question it<br>
is traditionally mentioned that it is necessary to<br>
apply, to the liquid active principle to be injected,<br>
on the one hand a high pressure between 200 and 500 bar<br>
in order to pierce the skin, and on the other hand a<br>
constant or decreasing pressure through to the end of<br>
the injection in order to ensure the transfer of the<br>
liquid active principle, the final values generally<br>
being between 40 and 250 bar.<br>
 <br>
<br>
However, there is a major stake in reducing the<br>
operating pressures so as to construct strong and<br>
economical	needleless	injection	devices,	more<br>
particularly for single-use devices or the consumable<br>
parts, such as the injection nozzle, of reusable<br>
devices while guaranteeing good reproducibility of<br>
injections.<br>
It has been surprisingly observed that the subject of<br>
the present invention precisely enables excellent<br>
needleless injection results to be attained with<br>
pressure profiles with initial values between 50 and<br>
150 bar, preferably between 70 and 100 bar, i.e. values<br>
clearly lower than those commonly accepted in the field<br>
considered.<br>
More precisely, the subject of the present invention<br>
relates to a needleless injection device comprising an<br>
energy source such as a gas generator, a reservoir<br>
blocked by an upstream stopper and a downstream stopper<br>
between which a liquid active principle is housed, and<br>
an injection nozzle equipped with a receptacle and with<br>
at least one injection duct, said receptacle containing<br>
a cavity with a height equal to the distance covered by<br>
the downstream stopper before opening each injection<br>
duct, characterized in that it is shaped such that:<br>
the height of the cavity in millimeters is<br>
between a minimum height and a maximum height<br>
respectively defined by the following equations:<br>
•	minimum height =3<br>
•	maximum height = 15 x exp(-(V/9)2)+10<br>
where V is the speed of the initial increase in<br>
the pressure profile expressed in bars per<br>
microsecond;<br>
- the ratio between the length of each injection<br>
duct and the height of the cavity is between 1 and 2.<br>
The speed of the initial increase in pressure will be<br>
understood to involve the calculation of dP/dt<br>
 <br>
<br>
throughout a period of time going schematically from 0<br>
to 0.5 millisecond.<br>
In addition, with a needleless injection device<br>
according to the invention it is possible to obtain<br>
pressure profiles that are not necessarily flat or<br>
uniformly decreasing, in contrast to what is commonly<br>
accepted today in the literature.<br>
Even if several parameters such as the number and the<br>
diameter of the orifices in the injection ducts, or the<br>
quantity of liquid active principle, play a part in<br>
controlling the injection depth, a crucial advantage of<br>
the invention lies in the fact that the large variety<br>
of permitted shapes of pressure profile, depending on<br>
the type of energy source used, ensures fine and<br>
optimized management of the injection depth.<br>
Moreover, another considerable advantage of a<br>
needleless injection device according to the invention<br>
is the fact that it has been observed that the final<br>
pressure has no influence on performance as long as it<br>
is greater than 20 bar, which should be compared with<br>
the final values of 40 to 250 bar commonly accepted in<br>
the literature.<br>
Advantageously, the minimum height of the cavity in<br>
millimeters is defined by the following equation:<br>
•	minimum height = 12 x exp(- (V/18)2)+4.<br>
Again advantageously, the maximum height of the cavity<br>
in millimeters is defined by the following equation:<br>
•	maximum height = 14 x exp(-(V/9)2)+9.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the length of each injection<br>
duct and the height of the cavity is between 1.1 and<br>
1.6.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Again preferably, the needleless injection device<br>
according to the invention is shaped in such a way that<br>
the time for an increase in pressure to 80 bar is<br>
schematically between 0.2 and 2.0 milliseconds.<br>
Advantageously, the energy source consists of a<br>
pyrotechnic gas generator equipped with a pyrotechnic<br>
charge and an ignition system.<br>
The invention will be better understood with the help<br>
of the detailed description set out below with regard<br>
to the appended drawing in which:<br>
figure 1 is a schematic longitudinal cross<br>
section view of a needleless injection device according<br>
to the invention;<br>
- figures 2 to 5 show examples of pressure profile<br>
curves obtained as a function of the velocity of the<br>
energy source used.<br>
A needleless injection device 1 according to the<br>
invention, as shown in figure 1, comprises a body 2 in<br>
which a reservoir 3 containing a liquid active<br>
principle 6 is housed.<br>
An injection nozzle comprising a receptacle 7 is<br>
positioned at the downstream end of the body 2, the<br>
injection system being conventionally covered by an<br>
outer protection (not shown) to ensure the asepsis of<br>
the injection device 1.<br>
A pyrotechnic gas generator 70 containing a pyrotechnic<br>
charge 72 is fixed by being screwed to the upstream end<br>
of the body 2 by means of a connecting member 71 which<br>
bears on the reservoir 3, the seal being ensured by a<br>
circular O-ring.<br>
The body 2 of the injection device 1 comprises two<br>
diametrically opposite windows in order to view the<br>
liquid active principle 6 contained in the reservoir 3.<br>
 <br>
<br>
Downstream of the body 2, in a suitably shaped bore,<br>
the receptacle 7, which will be described in more<br>
detail below, is shrunk on. The reservoir 3 bears on<br>
the receptacle 7 and is centered in the downstream part<br>
of the body 2, an intermediate transparent material 9<br>
being positioned around said reservoir 3. Upstream, the<br>
body 2 receives the connecting member 71 which is<br>
centered around the end of the reservoir 3. The latter<br>
essentially consists of a glass tube closed at both<br>
ends by a movable upstream stopper 4 and a movable<br>
downstream	stopper	5,	these	being	elements<br>
conventionally used in needleless injection devices and<br>
obtained by molding elastomers compatible with the<br>
liquid active principle 6 for a long duration, for<br>
example chlorobutyl or bromobutyl whose Shore hardness<br>
is schematically set between 45 and 70. These elements<br>
may receive surface treatments, in particular to<br>
facilitate their movement in the tubular reservoir 3.<br>
At rest, each element has a diameter about 10% greater<br>
than the internal diameter of the reservoir 3 and a<br>
height schematically between 0.5 and 0.8 times this<br>
diameter. Once engaged, each element has, due to the<br>
deformations it undergoes, a height of between around<br>
0.6 and 1.0 times the internal diameter of the<br>
reservoir 3.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the receptacle 7 is<br>
implemented by a part of cylindrical-conical outer<br>
shape which comprises a central cavity 10 in which the<br>
downstream stopper 5 will come to be housed. On its<br>
periphery the receptacle 7 comprises three injection<br>
ducts 8 uniformly offset in relation to each other. The<br>
diameter of the central cavity 10 is equal to that of<br>
the reservoir 3, and its free height is equal to that<br>
of the downstream stopper 5. When the latter has<br>
reached the base 7a of the receptacle 7 due to the<br>
actuation of the pyrotechnic gas generator 70, each<br>
injection duct 8 is then brought into communication<br>
with the liquid active principle 6 by means of an inlet<br>
 <br>
<br>
8a, said liquid active principle 6 flowing with a speed<br>
corresponding to the pressure transmitted by the<br>
upstream stopper 4.<br>
More precisely, the height of the cavity 10 in<br>
millimeters is chosen so as to be between a minimum<br>
height and a maximum height respectively defined by the<br>
following equations:<br>
•	minimum height = 3<br>
•	maximum height = 15 x exp(-(V/9)2) +10<br>
where V is the speed of the initial increase in the<br>
pressure profile expressed in bars per microsecond. The<br>
speed of the initial increase in pressure will be<br>
understood to involve the calculation of dP/dt<br>
throughout a period of time going schematically from 0<br>
to 0.5 millisecond. In addition, each injection duct 8<br>
is shaped so that the ratio of the length of said<br>
injection duct 8 to the height of the cavity 10 is<br>
between 1 and 2.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the height of the<br>
cavity 10 in millimeters is between a minimum height<br>
and a maximum height respectively defined by the<br>
following equations:<br>
•	minimum height = 12 x exp(-(V/18)2)+4<br>
•	maximum height = 14 x exp(-(V/9)2)+9<br>
and the ratio of the length of each injection duct 8 to<br>
the height of the cavity 10 is between 1.1 and 1.6.<br>
Even if several parameters such as the number and the<br>
diameter of the orifices in the injection ducts 8, or<br>
the quantity of liquid active principle 6, play a part<br>
in controlling the injection depth, it should be<br>
properly understood that a large variety of pressure<br>
profile shapes is available.<br>
•Indeed, with reference to figures 2 to 5, it will be<br>
noticed that just as much for a pyrotechnic charge 72<br>
of high intensity, the pressure profile of which is<br>
 <br>
shown in figure 2 and characterized by a time for an<br>
increase in pressure to 80 bar of around 0.2<br>
millisecond, as for other pyrotechnic charges 72 of<br>
medium, low, or very low intensity, the pressure<br>
profiles of which are shown in figures 3 to 5 and which<br>
are characterized by a time for an increase in pressure<br>
to 80 bar of around 0.5 millisecond, 1.0 millisecond<br>
and 2.0 milliseconds respectively, it is possible to<br>
obtain different pressure profiles for a given<br>
intensity according to the type of primer 73 chosen to<br>
initiate the pyrotechnic charge 72. By way of<br>
illustration, in each of the configurations shown in<br>
figures 2 to 5, two examples of different pressure<br>
profile curves are plotted. The preferred pressure<br>
profile curve with the lowest final pressure is shown<br>
with a continuous line and the pressure profile curve<br>
with the highest final pressure is shown with a dotted<br>
line.<br>
It has been observed that it is possible, for example<br>
to carry out completely satisfactory subcutaneou;<br>
injections of 0.5 milliliter of liquid active principlf<br>
6 with a pressure of around 8 0 bar at the start of the<br>
injection and of 30 bar at the end of the injection,<br>
for an injection device 1 equipped with three injection<br>
ducts 8 of 250 micrometers diameter. Of course, the<br>
pressure values and the number/diameter of the<br>
injection ducts 8 are suited to the quantity of liquid<br>
active principle 6 to be injected, along with its<br>
viscosity and the desired injection depth.<br>
In this embodiment the pyrotechnic gas generator 70<br>
acts on the upstream stopper 4 by means of a piston 11<br>
of effective cross section equal to that of said<br>
upstream stopper 4. Since this piston 11 is in contact<br>
with the upstream stopper 4, there is therefore no<br>
shock or ram effect at the start of operation. This<br>
piston 11, thanks to its sealing system, prevents the<br>
gases generated by the combustion of the pyrotechnic<br>
 <br>
charge 72 from coming into contact with the upstream<br>
stopper 4, and therefore allows possible damage thereof<br>
and gas leakage into the liquid active principle 6<br>
contained in the reservoir 3 to be avoided. The piston<br>
11, of a suitable color, may also serve as an operating<br>
indicator by appearing in the viewing windows of the<br>
body 2.<br>
At this stage we will describe the main elements of the<br>
pyrotechnic gas generator 7 0 on top of the pyrotechnic<br>
charge 72 and the primer 73. More precisely, the<br>
pyrotechnic gas generator 70 comprises a connecting<br>
member 71 positioned around the piston 11, and in which<br>
the pyrotechnic charge 72 is located, just above said<br>
piston 11. The primer 73 is mounted on top of the<br>
pyrotechnic charge 72, the combustion of which is<br>
initiated when said primer 73 is struck by a striker<br>
74. In the initial position, the striker 74 is held in<br>
a striker guide 75 screwed into the connecting member<br>
71 by balls 77 partly engaged in a groove in the<br>
striker 74. A striking device is also provided and<br>
breaks down into a pusher 7 8 having an enlarged groove<br>
79 and an internal spring 76. The pusher 78 slides on<br>
the outside of the striker guide 75, and it is held by<br>
lugs moving in lateral grooves. This pusher 78<br>
constitutes in this example the triggering element.<br>
Of course, to initiate the combustion of the<br>
pyrotechnic charge 72, it is possible, without<br>
departing from the scope of the invention, to use<br>
initiation devices other than the previously described<br>
striker device. Without going into details and without<br>
seeking to be exhaustive, we mention as examples<br>
electric battery initiation devices or piezoelectric<br>
initiation devices.<br>
The pyrotechnic gas generator 70 may optionally be<br>
replaced by a gas generator, consisting of a reservoir<br>
of compressed gas closed bv a cruick openina valve. The<br>
 <br>
triggering element will open said valve, and the<br>
compressed gases from the reservoir will then be able<br>
to expand and act on the pushing means.<br>
For the use of the injection device 1 according to the<br>
invention, after having removed the asepsis cap and<br>
having placed the downstream side of said injection<br>
device 1 on the skin of the subject to be treated, the<br>
operator presses with his/her thumb the pusher 78,<br>
which is pushed in, compressing the spring 76. The<br>
pusher 78 moves translationally until the enlarged<br>
groove 79 of the striker 74 reaches the height of the<br>
balls 77. On doing this, the latter balls engage under<br>
the effect of gravity in the enlarged groove 79 and<br>
thus release the striker 74 which then violently<br>
strikes the primer 73, the initiation of which ignites<br>
the pyrotechnic charge 72. The gases generated by the<br>
latter will, in a known manner, force the column<br>
consisting of the upstream stopper 4, the liquid active<br>
principle 6 and the downstream stopper 5 to slide along<br>
the reservoir 3 until the downstream stopper 5 stops<br>
against the base 7a of the receptacle 7. Under the<br>
effect of the deformation, the downstream stopper 5<br>
frees the inlets 8a of the injection ducts 8 and<br>
therefore allows the liquid active principle 6 to be<br>
injected at high speed so as to be able to pass through<br>
the skin of the person to be treated.<br>
Although the invention has been described in connection<br>
with particular exemplary embodiments, it is obvious<br>
that it is in no way limited thereto and that it covers<br>
all the technical equivalents of the means described<br>
and their combinations if these fall within the scope<br>
of the invention.<br>
 <br>

and a maximum height, respectively defined by the following relationships, • minimum<br>
height = 3, • maximum height = 15 x exp. (-(V/9)2) +10, where V is the initial speed of<br>
ascent of the pressure profile expressed in bar per microsecond, - the ratio between the<br>
length of each injection conduit and the height of the cavity being between 1 and 2.</td>
