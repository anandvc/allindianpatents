				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an electrochemical process for the recovery of cerium (IV) hydroxide / oxide from rare earth chlorides.<br>
The cerium (IV) oxide finds application in [i] polishing of optical and ophthalmic glasses, [ii] glass decolouring, [iii] making shells of TV tubes, [iv] stabiliser for glass used for TV tubes, windows for nuclear industry and glass used in UV sterilisation and [v] in glass to cover solar battery cells in satellites.<br>
Usually, the Rare Earths refers to a group of 14 elements from Lanthanum to Yittrium. These are present in the Monazite sand from which the individual components are separated by appropriate techniques. The rare earth solution is obtained during the processing of minerals such as monazite sand. The rare earth chlorides so obtained has the following composition: Samarium 2 to 3%. Praseodymium 5 to 6%, Neodymium 19 to 22%, Lanthanum 22 to 24%, Cerium at least 45%, Yittrium and others 0.5 to 1%. As can be seen Cerium is the major constituent constituting about 45-48% (as Ce02).<br>
Hitherto it has been the practice to recover eerie hydroxide by chemical reaction between the rare earth chlorides and sodium hypochlorite. [Ref: Yost, D. M, et.al (ed) The Rare Earth Elements and their Compounds, John Wiley Inc, New York, 1947 P.44]. The process has the following disadvantages:<br>
In the chemical process, sodium chloride, a low value byproduct is obtained.  The preparation of sodium<br><br>
hypochlorite, involves transport and storage of chlorine which may lead to environmental hazard. Further a separate unit operation for the preparation of hypochlorite is required.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an electrochemical process for the recovery of the rare earth chloride solution obtained while processing cerium (IV) hydroxide from monazite sand containing rare earth elements from Lanthanum to Yittrium, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide the hypochlorite necessary for the oxidation of cerium (III) 'in situ1 by the electrolysis of rare earth chloride solution containing cerous chloride without the addition of sodium chloride.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to employ the metal oxides coated titanium anodes to reduce the electrical energy involved in the process, as well as to avoid the problems associated with the dissolution of the anode material normally encountered with graphite anode in chloride electrolytes.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to employ a rotating cathode which avoids the deposition of the cerium (IV) hydroxide onto the cathode thus resulting in high performance efficiencies.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an electrochemical process for the recovery of cerium (IV)<br><br>
hydroxide / oxide from rare earth chlorides which comprises; electrolysing rare earth chloride solution used as electrolyte containing cerium (III) chloride 100-180 g/1 in an electrochemical cell having coated titanium anode and rotating cathode such as herein described concentrically placed inside the anode and the said rare earth chlorides as electrolyte at 10 to 30°C, anode current density of 1 - 5 A. dm-2, recovering precipitated cerium (IV) hydroxide by filtration, heating in a conventional manner to get cerium oxide.<br>
The anode is of titanium substrate coated with mixed oxides of noble metals and non-noble metals like ruthenium, iridium, palladium, titanium, tin and antimony such that RuO2/TiO2 (30:70), RuO2/TiO2/SnO2 (30:58:12), RuO2/IrO2/Ti02 (15:15:70) etc and is in the form of strips positioned in a circular arrangement or perforated cylindrical structure or expanded mesh type. The cathode being a cylindrical rod positioned at the centre surrounded by the anode (s), with an interelectrode distance of 0.5 to 1.5cm and connected through a shaft to a motor, the electrical connection being given through the shaft. The electrochemical cell is fitted with one or more anodes and cathodes. Rare earth chloride solution containing 100 - 180 g/1 of chloride at a p in the range of 5.0 to 7.0 is used as electrolyte. Cathode rotation being maintained at a peripheral velocity between 50 to 100 m.min-1, when the cerium (III) is oxidised to cerium (IV) and precipitated as cerium (IV) hydroxide, at a current efficiency of<br><br>
55 - 60% with a product purity of about 91%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, rare earth chloride solution containing 125 g/1 chloride is used as the electrolyte at a pH 6.0 and maintained at a temperature of 20°C.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the anode current density is 2.5 A.dm-2 and the cathode<br><br>
current density is 4.5A.dm-2  and the cathode rotation is<br>
maintained at a peripheral velocity of 98m.min-1.<br>
The elctrochemical process operated under the above conditions provides the oxidation of cerium (III) to cerium (IV) which precipitates as cerium (IV) hydroxide at a current efficiency of 55 to 60% with a product purity of about 91%.<br>
The oxidation of cerium (III) to cerium (IV) and separation of cerium as cerium (IV) hydroxide effected by the present invention provides a novel process than the conventional method, in that the present process does not require addition of sodium hypochlorite from an external source. Further the present process avoides the addition of sodium ions to the process stream, containing mainly rare earth ions thus eliminating the downstreams process for the separation of sodium chloride from the rare earth salt solutions.<br>
The following typical examples are given to illustrate the invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention:<br><br>
