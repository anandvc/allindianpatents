				<td>The invention relates to an electric lamp with a lamp cap.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Such an electric lamp is disclosed,for example,in the International Patent Application WO 97/40921. This 1aid-open Patent application describes an electric incandescent lamp, in particular a motor vehicle headlight lamp,having mn incandescent filament enclosed in a vitreous lamp bulb and a lamp cap consisting of metal and plastic. The end, sealed in a gas tight fashion, of the lamp bulb is fixed in a metal holder which,is anchored in the plastic cap provided with the electric connections of the lamp. The supply leads,which are guided out of the lamp bulb and connected to the incandescent filament,are welded in the interior of the plastic cap to the electric connections of the lamp,which are constructed as contact lugs. For the purpose of welding the supply lead and contact lug,the contact lugs in each case have a bore through which the corresponding supply lead is guided. The supply lead ends<br>
guided through are welded to the contact lug. The interior<br>
of the plmstic cup is closed with a cover. For the purpose of sealing against the ingression of air humidity,the lamp cap has hose-like silicon parts through which the supply leads are guided,and which are arranged with a press fit in the bushings of the plastic cap for the supply leads. The press fit is produced with the aid of the contact lugs,which exert a pressure on the silicon hoses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide an electric lamp having an improved lamp cap and, in particular, having improved electric connections.<br>
This object is achieved according to the features of the invention. Particularly advantageous designs of the invention are described in the subsequent paragraphs.<br>
The electric lamp according to the invention has a lamp cap, a transparent lamp bulb, at least one luminous means surrounded by the lamp bulb,at least two supply lead wires, guided out of the lamp bulb,for supplying power to the at least one luminous means,and a holder for the lamp bulb as<br>
well as a plastic cmp which is provided with the electric connections, constructed as at least two contact lugs, of the lamp, and in which the holder is anchored. According to the invention, the at least two contact lugs in each cASE have a groove in which in each case a supply lead wire is fixed to the corresponding contact lug by a welded Joint. Furthermore, the at least two contact lugs according to the invention are equipped with mena for threading the supply lead wires into the respectively groove. The lamp cap further has at least one cut-out serving the purpose of carrying out the welding of the supply lead wires to the contact lugs.<br>
The abovementioned features of the lamp according to the invention permit the contact lugs to be injected into the plastic cap, and and permit dispesing with additional means for sealing the lamp cap against the ingress ion of air humidity such as, for example, silicon hoses or potting compound. Moreover, there is also no need for a cover to close the cap interior. The welded joint between the supply lead wires and contact lugs is made, in the case of the lamp according to the invention, with the aid of a laser, for exmaple, by a tiny cut-out in the lamp cap. The<br>
abovementioned cut-out i,advantageously arranged in the holder, and not in the scaled plastic cap. For the purpose of producing the abovnamed welded jointf it is advantageous, because of the low melting temperature,to heat the contact lugs,consisting of steel sheet,and not the supply lead wires produced from molybdenum.<br>
The means for threading the supply lead wires advantageously have for each groove two webs which delimit the groove laterally) the edge,facing the groove, of at least one of these webs being provided with a plant. In the particularly preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention,the edges facing the groove,of the two webs have a slant in each case. These slants ensure that during mounting of the lamp the tsupply lead wire ends are automatically threaded without a problem into the grooves of the contact lugs. The two webs delimiting the groove advantagesouly have different lengths. Consequently, the longer web can serve as a guiding aid for the supply lead wire to be threaded. The shorter of the two<br>
webs advantageously has a lesser wLdth than the longer web.<br>
This facilitate,the welding of the supply lead Wire mnd contact lug,because in order to weld the two abovemeentioned components, only the material of the shorter web need be heated briefly above the melting point thereof. After the weated material has solidified,the supply lead wire is connected to the shorter web by means of a welded joint.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with the aid of a preferred exemplary embodiment. In the accompanying drawings;<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of the preferred exemplary embodiment of the lamp according to the invention with reflector,partially sectioned,and<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross section through a part of the lamp cap of the lamp illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
The preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention is « singla-filament halogen incandescent lamp which is provided for use in a motor vehicle headlight. This lamp has a vitreousi essentially cylindrical lamp bulb 10 having a pinch foot 10a sealed in a gas tight fashion. The done 10b of the lamp bulb 10 is provided with a light-absorbing coating. Serving as light source is an incandescent filament 11 which is aligned parallel to the lamp bulb axis and is connected in an electrically conductive fashion to two supply leads 12, 13 which are guided out of the two pinch foot 10a and consist of molybdenum wire. The pinch foot 10a of the lamp bulb 10 is fixed in a metal holder which consists of the cup-like holder part 14a, the intermediate ring 14e and the annular carrier sleeve 14b. In addition to the metal holder 14a, 14b, the lamp cap also has a plastic cap 13 which is provided with the electric connections 16, 17 of the lamp and in which the annular metal carrier sleeve 14b is anchored. The carrier sleeve 14b has three reference noses 14c, situated in a plane, and a pressing-on spring 14d for mounting the lamp in the reflector 2O of a motor vehicle headlight. The sealing of the reflector 20 is performed by means of a silicone sealing ring 19 which bears against the outer wall of the reflector 20 and against the<br>
plastic cap 15. The design of the lamp in accordance with the preferred exemplary embodiment, and its us,in a headligt are represented diagrammatically in Figure 1.<br>
The electric connections 16,17 of the lamp consist of two metal contact lugs 16» 17 which are welded in each case to one of the supply lead wires 12,13 (not illustrated in Figure 1. The contact lugs 16,17 are made froat a steel sheet and are injected in the plastic cap 15 of the lamp cap,. They 16,17 consist in each case of an L-shaped steel sheet. In each case one limb 16a» 17a of the L-shaped contact lugs 16,17 is constructed as a plug-in contact, while the other limb 16b,17b is equipped with a groove 16c, 17c into which each case the angled end 12a,13a of a supply lead wire 12,13 is threaded. The regions,normally covered in the cross section of Figure 2,of the contact lugs 16,17 are represented by dashes in Figure 2. The angle region of the L-shaped contact lugs 16,17 is tightly injected in the plastic cap 15 and is therefore normally not visible. The groove 16c,17c are laterally delimited in each case by two webs 16d,16e or 17d,17e of different length. Two webs 16d» 16e or 17d,17e in each case have on their edge facing the groove 16c,17c a slant 16f,17f which serves to thread the<br>
supply lead wins 12, 13 into the groove 16c,17c. The shorter web 16e, 17e has a ,lesser width than the longer web 16d, 17d. The welded joint between the supply lead wire, 12, 13 and the contact lugs 16,17 is produced by briefly heating the material on the shorter webs 16e, 17e above its melting point by means of a laser. After the solidification of the melt, the angled end 12a, 13a of the supply lead wire 12, 13 is connected to the shorter web 16e, 17e. The L-limbs 16b, 17b welded to the supply lead wires 12» 13 extend as far as into the interior formed by the carrier sleeve 14b anchored in the plastic cap 19. The carrier sleeve 14b is provided at the level of the webs 16d, 16e, 17d, 17e with a cut-out 18 via which the laser welding of the supply lead wires 12, 13 to the shorter webs 16e, 17e of the correspondimg contact lug 16, 17 is performed after the mounting of the lamp cap.<br>
