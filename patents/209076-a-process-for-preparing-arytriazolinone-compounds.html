Some known methods for the preparation of. l.-aryltriazolinones require formation of a 1-aryltriazolidinone ring followed by conversion of the 1-aryltriazolidinone ring to the desired 1-aryltriazolmone. This requirement is disadvantageous because it adds an additional step to the process of preparing 1-aryltriazolinones. Other known methods provide less than optimum yields of 1-aryltriazolinone because of by-product formation. Given the commercial value of 1-aryltriazolinones, improved processes for their preparation are therefore needed.<br>

The carbonylation of amidrazone (A) as set forth herein is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of about 10° C to about 200° C for a period of time of up to about 20 hours, preferably in the range of about ambient temperature to about 160° C for about 10 hours, and more preferably up to about 5 hours.<br>
1 ^	Generally, in a process of carbonylating an amidrazone (A), a hydrazine<br>
derivative, for example, 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine (1) is first prepared from its hydrochloride salt by treating the salt with a base, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, giving the free hydrazine (1). The free hydrazine (1) is in turn reacted with, for example, ethyl acetimidate at a temperature of about 0° C to about ambient<br>
1f| temperature in an appropriate solvent such as methylene chloride, yielding the corresponding amidrazone (A), 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazidethaneimidic acid.

2(\     dichlorophenyl)-3-methyl-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one.	The     carbonylation     of<br>
amidrazone (A) to the compound of formula (I) is routinely aided with a catalyst, such as DMAP. A detailed procedure for the preparation, and carbonylation of an amidrazone (A) to yield a compound of formula (I) is set forth in Example 3 hereinbelow.<br>

A useful ratio of solvent to hydrozonoyl derivative (A) to afford optimum reaction conditions is in the range of about 2.5/1 to about 20/1 wt/wt, preferably about 3/1 to about 15/1.<br><br>
Accordingly, when diglyme is the solvent of choice in which to conduct the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A), the rate of reaction benefits from the inclusion of a reaction rate-promoting amount of water. Inasmuch as the reaction proceeds in an acceptable manner without the presence of water, it is believed that it aids in dissolving the ring-forming agent thereby enhancing its contact with hydrazonoyl derivative (A) causing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate. The ratio of reaction rate-promoting amount of water to solvent as used in the present invention is in the range of about 0.001/1 to about 1/1 wt/wt. A preferred ratio is about 0.01/1 to about 0.9/1, more preferably about 0.04/1 to about 0.8/1.<br>
In order to form a compound of formula I, a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) is condensed with at least one ring-forming agent. Useful ring-forming agents in the process of the present invention include, for example, such as, without limitation sodium cyanate, potasium cyanate, silver cyanate, methyl carbamate, ethyl carbamate, phenyl carbamate, cyanic acid, isocyanic acid, acetyl isocyanate, and<br><br><br>
trimethylsilyl isocyanate. Preferred ring-forming agents are sodium cyanate, potassium cyanate, cyanic acid, isocyanic acid, and phenyl carbamate. More preferred ring-forming agents are sodium cyanate and potassium cyanate, particularly potassium cyanate. A useful mole ratio of ring-forming agent to hydrazonoyl derivative (A) of about 1/1 to about 5/1, preferably about 1.05/1 to about 2/1, and more preferably about 1.1/1 to about 1.3/1.<br>
1(<br>
Preferably, the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) to form a compound of formula I is conducted in the presence of a catalyst. Accordingly, useful catalysts, such as those described sbove, for condensing hydrazonoyl derivative (A) include potassium iodide, potassium fluoride, silver bromide, silver iodide, and elemental iodine. Preferred catalysts are potassium iodide, potassium fluoride, and elemental iodine, particularly potassium fluoride. The catalyst used in the present invention can be present in a mole ratio of catalyst to hydrazonoyl derivative (A) in a range of about 0.001/1 to about 0.1/1, preferably<br>
15 about 0.004/1 to about 0.06/1. Additional amounts of catalyst may be added if necessary to drive the reaction faster, for example.<br>
The temperature at which and the period for which a chemical reaction such as the condensation reaction of a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) is conducted will vary, as dfscussed above. The condensing of hydrazonoyl derivative (A) as set<br>
20J forth herein is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of about -10° C to about 160° C for a period of time up to about 30 hours, preferably in the range of about 0° C to about 100° C for up to about 20 hours, more preferably up to about 10 hours.<br>
Generally in a process of condensing a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) to form a compound of formula (I), the free hydrazine (1) as described above, for example, 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine (1) is reacted with acetic anhydride at a temperature of about 10° C in an appropriate solvent such as ethyl acetate, yielding the corresponding l-acetyl-2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazine (2). The hydrazine (2) is then chlorinated with phosphorous oxychloride at a temperature of about 110° C<br>
3)     in an appropriate solvent such as toluene, yielding the hydrazonoyl derivative of<br>
'   ^<br><br>
formula (A), N-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethanehydrozonoyl chloride. The hydrozonoyl chloride (A) is condensed with a ring forming agent, for example, potassium cyanate at a temperature of about 40° C to about 65° C in an appropriate solvent such as DMAC, yielding the corresponding compound of formula (I), 45-dihydro-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methyl-l,2,4-triazol-5(lH)-one. The condensing of hydrozonoyl chloride (A) to the compound of formula (I) in solvents such as DMAC is routinely aided by the presence of a catalyst, such as potassium fluoride. A detailed procedure for the preparation, and the potassium fluoride-catalized condensing of the hydrozonoyl chloride (A) with the ring forming agent potassium cyanate in DMAC to yield a compound of formula (I) is set forth in Example 1 hereinbelow.<br>
In a variation of the process of condensing a hydrazonoyl derivative of formula (A) to form a compound of formula (I), the hyrazonoyl derivative (A), for example, N-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethanehydrozonoyl chloride is conducted at ambient temperature in the solvent diglyme in the presence of a catalytic amount of water. A detailed procedure for the preparation, and the water-catalized condensing of the hydrozonoyl chloride (A) with the ring forming agent potassium cyanate in diglyme to yield a compound of formula (I) is set forth in Example 2 hereinbelow.<br>
