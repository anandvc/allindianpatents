PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to biosensors, and more particularly, relates to a method and apparatus for implementing threshold based correction functions for biosensors.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The quantitative determination of analytes in body fluids is of great importance in the diagnoses and maintenance of certain physiological abnormalities. For example lactate, cholesterol and bilirubin should be monitored in certain individuals. In particular, the determination of glucose in body fluids is of great importance to diabetic individuals who must frequently check the level of glucose in their body fluids as a means of regulating the glucose intake in their diets. While the remainder of the disclosure herein will be directed towards the determination of glucose, it is to be understood that the procedure and apparatus of this invention can be used for the determination of other analytes upon selection of the appropriate enzyme. The ideal diagnostic device for the detection of glucose in fluids must be simple, so as not to require a high degree of technical skill on the part of the technician administering the test. In many cases, these tests are administered by the patient which lends further emphasis to the need for a test which is easy to carry out. Additionally, such a device should be based upon elements which are sufficiently stable to meet situations of prolonged storage.<br>
Methods for determining analyte concentration in fluids can be based on the electrochemical reaction between an enzyme and the analyte specific to the enzyme and a mediator which maintains the enzyme in its initial oxidation state. Suitable redox enzymes include oxidases, dehydrogenases, catalase and peroxidase. For example, in the case where glucose is the analyte, the reaction with glucose oxidase and oxygen is represented by equation (A), <br>
glucose + O2 glucose oxidase (GO)&gt; ghiconolactone + H2O2<br>
(A)<br>
-2-<br><br>
In a colorimetric assay, the released hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of a peroxidase, causes a color change in a redox indicator which color change is proportional to the level of glucose in the test fluid. While colorimetric tests can be made semi-quantitative by the use of color charts for comparison of the color change of the redox indicator with the color change obtained using test fluids of known glucose concentration, and can be rendered more highly quantitative by reading the result with a spectrophotometric instrument, the results are generally not as accurate nor are they obtained as quickly as those obtained using an electrochemical biosensor. As used herein, the term biosensor system refer to an analytical device that responds selectively to analytes in an appropriate sample and converts their concentration into an electrical signal via a combination of a biological recognition signal and a physico-chemical transducer.<br>
H2O2	&gt; O2 + 2H+ + 2e-<br>
(B) <br>
The electron flow is then converted to the electrical signal which directly correlates<br>
to the glucose concentration.<br>
In the initial step of the reaction represented by equation (A), glucose present in the<br>
test sample converts the oxidized flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) center of the<br>
enzyme into its reduced form, (FADH2). Because these redox centers are essentially<br>
electrically insulated within the enzyme molecule, direct electron transfer to the<br>
surface of a conventional electrode* does not occur to any measurable degree in the<br>
absence of an unacceptably high overvoltage. An improvement to this system<br>
involves the use of a nonphysiological redox coupling between the electrode and the<br>
enzyme to  shuttle  electrons  between the  (FADH2)  and  the electrode.  This is<br>
represented by the following scheme in which the redox coupler, typically referred<br>
to as a mediator, is represented by M:<br>
Glucose + GO(FAD)	&gt; gluconolactone + GO(FADH2)<br>
GO(FADH2) + 2Mox	&gt; GO(FAD) + 2Mred + 2H+<br>
2Mred	&gt; 2Mox + 2e- (at the electrode)<br>
-3-<br><br>
In this scheme, GO(FAD) represents the oxidized form of glucose oxidase and GO(FADH2) indicates its reduced form. The mediating species Mred shuttles electrons from the reduced enzyme to the electrode thereby oxidizing the enzyme causing its regeneration in situ which, of course, is desirable for reasons of economy. The main purpose for using a mediator is to reduce the working potential of the sensor. An ideal mediator would be re- oxidized at the electrode at a low potential under which impurity in the chemical layer and interfering substances in the sample would not be oxidized thereby minimizing interference.<br>
Many compounds are useful as mediators due to their ability to accept electrons from the reduced enzyme and transfer them to the electrode. Among the mediators known to be useful as electron transfer agents in analytical determinations are the substituted benzo- and naphthoquinones disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,746,607; the NT-oxides, nitroso compounds, hydroxy lamines and oxines specifically disclosed in EP O 354 441 ; the flavins, phenazines, phenothiazines, indophenols, substituted 1 ,4-benzoquinones and mdamins disclosed in EP O 330 517 and the phenazinium/phenoxazinium salts described in U.S. Patent 3,791 ,988. A comprehensive review of electrochemical mediators of biological redox systems can be found in Analytica Clinica Acta. 140 (1982), Pp 1-18.<br>
Among the more venerable mediators is hexacyanoferrate, also known as ferricyanide, which is discussed by Schlapfer et al in Clinica Chimica Acta., 57 (1974), Pp. 283-289. In U.S. Patent 4,929,545 there is disclosed the use of a soluble ferricyanide compound in combination with a soluble ferric compound in a composition for enzymatically determining an analyte in a sample. Substituting the iron salt of ferricyanide for oxygen in equation (A) provides: <br>
Glucose + Fe+++(CN)6 -GO_&gt; gluconolactone + Fe++(CN)6<br>
since the ferricyanide is reduced to ferrocyanide by its acceptance of electrons from the glucose oxidase enzyme.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Another way of expressing this reaction is by use of the following equation (C):<br>
Glucose + GOx(ox) -~	&gt; Gluconalactone + GOx(red)<br>
GOx(red) + 2 Fe(CN3)3- e % 	&gt; GOX(ox) + 2 Fe(CN)4- + 2e-<br>
(C) <br>
The electrons released are directly equivalent to the amount of glucose in the test fluid and can be related thereto by measurement of the current which is produced through the fluid upon the application of a potential thereto. Oxidation of the ferrocyanide at the anode renews the cycle.<br>
U.S. patent 6,391 ,645 to Huang et al., issued May 21 , 2002 and assigned to the present assignee, discloses a method and apparatus for correcting ambient temperature effect in biosensors. An ambient temperature value is measured. A sample is applied to the biosensors, then a current generated in the test sample is measured. An observed analyte concentration value is calculated from the current through a standard response curve. The observed analyte concentration is then modified utilizing the measured ambient temperature value to thereby increase the accuracy of the analyte determination. The analyte concentration value can be calculated by solving the following equation:<br>
G2=(G1-(T22-242)*I2-(T2-24)*I1)/ <br>
((T22-242)*S2+(T2-24)*S1 + 1)<br>
 where G1is said observed analyte concentration value, T2 is said measured ambient temperature value and 11,12, S1, and S2 are predetermined parameters. While the method and apparatus disclosed by U.S. patent 6,391,645 provided improvements in the accuracy of the analyte determination, a need exists for an improved correction mechanism and that can be applied to any system that measures an analyte concentration.<br>
As used in the following specification and claims, the term biosensor means an electrochemical sensor strip or sensor element of an analytical device or biosensor system that responds selectively to an analyte in an appropriate sample and converts their concentration into an electrical signal. The biosensor generates an electrical<br>
-5-<br><br>
signal directly, facilitating a simple instrument design. Also, a biosensor offers the advantage of low material cost since a thin layer of chemicals is deposited on the electrodes and little material is wasted.<br>
The term sample is defined as a composition containing an unknown amount of the analyte of interest. Typically, a sample for electrochemical analysis is in liquid form, and preferably the sample is an aqueous mixture. A sample may be a biological sample, such as blood, urine or saliva. A sample may be a derivative of a biological sample, such as an extract, a dilution, a filtrate, or a reconstituted precipitate. The term analyte is defined as a substance in a sample, the presence or amount of which is to be determined. An analyte interacts with the oxidoreductase enzyme present during the analysis, and can be a substrate for the oxidoreductase, a coenzyme, or another substance that affects the interaction between the oxidoreductase and its substrate.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Important aspects of the present invention are to provide a new and improved biosensor system for determining the presence or amount of a substance in a sample including a method and apparatus for implementing threshold based correction functions for biosensors.<br>
In brief, a method and apparatus are provided for implementing threshold based correction functions for biosensors. A sample is applied to the biosensor and a primary measurement of an analyte value is obtained. A secondary measurement of a secondary effect is obtained and is compared with a threshold value. A correction function is identified responsive to the compared values. The correction function is applied to the primary measurement of the analyte value to provide a corrected analyte value.<br>
In accordance with features of the invention, the correction method uses correction curves that are provided to correct for an interference effect. The correction curves<br>
-6-<br><br>
can be linear or non-linear. The correction method provides different correction functions above and below the threshold value. The correction functions may be dependent or independent of the primary measurement that is being corrected. The correction functions may be either linear or nonlinear.<br>
In accordance with features of the invention, the secondary measurement of a secondary effect includes a plurality of effects that are use separately or together in combination to identify the correction function. For example, the secondary effects include temperature, Hemoglobin, and the concentration of hematocrit of a blood sample that are identified and used to minimize the interference of the secondary effects on the accuracy of the reported results.<br>

-7-<br><br>
for storing program and user data and correction curves for implementing threshold based correction of secondary effects in accordance with the present invention. A meter function 106 coupled to a biosensor 108 is operatively controlled by the microprocessor 102 for recording test values, such as blood glucose test values. An ON/OFF input at a line 110 responsive to the user ON/OFF input operation is coupled to the microprocessor 102 for performing the blood test sequence mode of biosensor system 100.

having a general form as shown in the following TABLE 1 and as illustrated and described with respect to FIG. 2. This invention provides an algorithmic correction method that advantageously improves the accuracy of diagnostic chemistry tests by correcting for secondary effects, such as interfering substances or temperature effects.<br>
It should be understood that the present invention can be applied to any system, electrochemical or optical, that measures an analyte concentration as a primary measurement and then uses a second measure of interfering substances, for example, Hemoglobin, or interfering effects for example, temperature, to compensate for the secondary effect and improve the accuracy of the reported result.<br>
It is also desirable to minimize the interference from hematocrit or volume fraction of erythrocytes on the accuracy of the reported results. The conductivity or impedance of whole blood is dependent on the concentration of hematocrit. Meter function 120 can be used to measure the resistance of the sample fluid at signal input line 120 and the measured value advantageously used to correct for the effect of hematocrit on the reported result. For example, the measured resistance advantageously is used to estimate the concentration of hematocrit of a blood sample and then to correct the measurement for hematocrit effect for deterrnining the concentration of a substance of interest in blood. This invention provides an algorithmic correction method that advantageously improves the accuracy of diagnostic chemistry tests by correcting for secondary effects including interference from hematocrit and temperature effects.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the algorithmic correction method uses correction curves, for example, as illustrated and described with respect to FIGS. 3 and 4, that can be tailored to correct for any well-defined interference effect. The correction curves can be linear or non-linear. The algorithmic correction method has characteristics that can be modified by changing only the equation coefficients as<br>
-9-<br><br>
follows. First, different correction functions can be provided above and below a threshold. Second, the correction functions may be dependent or independent of the primary measurement that is being corrected. Third, functions used for correction may be either linear or nonlinear.<br>

and A, I, F, H, are coefficients that control magnitude of correction lines or define<br>
correction curves.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, there are shown exemplary logical steps performed in accordance with the present invention of the method for implementing threshold based correction of secondary effects, such as correcting ambient temperature effect, in the biosensor system 100. A strip is inserted as indicated in a block 200 and then waiting for a sample to be applied is performed as indicated in a block 202. A primary measurement Gn is obtained as indicated in a block 204. Then a secondary measurement T to be used for correction Gn(T) is obtained as indicated in a block 206. The secondary measurement T is compared with the threshold value Tc as indicated in a decision block 208. If the secondary measurement T is less than or equal to the threshold value Tc, then a coefficient A to control magnitude of the correction is identified as indicated in a block 210, where A = f(Gn). Then a correction Cn is calculated as indicated in a block 210, where Cn = F * T + A * (Tc - T) + H. Otherwise If the secondary measurement T is greater than the threshold value Tc, then a coefficient I to control magnitude of the correction is identified as<br>
-10-<br><br>
indicated in a block 214, where I = f2(Gn). Then a correction Cn is calculated as indicated in a block 216, where Cn = F*T + I*(T-TC) + H. A final corrected result Gc is calculated as indicated in a block 218, where Gc = Gn/Cn to complete the correction algorithm as indicated in a block 220.<br>

A threshold value Tc is indicated by a line labeled Tc.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates isometric correction lines at different primary measurement concentrations Gn where the correction is dependent on the primary measurement concentrations Gn. As shown in the example 300 in FIG. 3, the magnitude of the correction Cn changes with analyte concentration Gn when the secondary measurement T is above or below the threshold Tc. FIG. 4 illustrates isometric correction lines at different primary measurement concentrations Gn where the correction is dependent on the primary measurement concentrations Gn above the threshold value Tc and is constant and independent of the primary measurement concentrations Gn below and equal to the threshold value Tc.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A biosensor system, method and apparatus are provided for implementing threshold based correction functions for biosensors. A primary measurement of an analyte value is obtained. A secondary measurement of a secondary effect is obtained and is compared with a threshold value. A correction function is identified responsive to the compared values. The correction function is applied to the primary measurement of the analyte value to provide a corrected analyte value. The correction method uses correction curves that are provided to correct for an interference effect. The correction curves can be linear or non-linear. The correction method provides different correction functions above and below the threshold value. The correction functions may be dependent or independent of the primary measurement that is being corrected. The correction functions may be either linear or nonlinear.<br>
