				<td>A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A PIROXICAM: BETA-<br>
CYCLODEXTRIN INCLUSION COMPOUND<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of an<br>
inclusion compound of piroxicam with β-cyclodextrin by spray-drying,<br>
applicable on a pilot or industrial scale.<br>
More particularly, the present invention is directed to a process for the<br>
preparation of 1:2.5 piroxicam:β-cyclodextrin inclusion compound provided<br>
with optimal physico-chemical characteristics as well as technological and<br>
biopharmaceutical properties for preparing solid pharmaceutical compositions<br>
for the oral administration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Piroxicam is a compound belonging to the class of the Non Steroidal<br>
Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) widely applied in rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
osteoarthritis, acute pain in musculoskeletal disorders, post-operative and<br>
post-traumatic pain and dysmenorrhoea.<br>
Piroxicam is poorly soluble in water (0.003% at pH 5, 37°C) and<br>
exhibits a low surface wettability (water contact angle 76°) and a high crystal<br>
lattice energy as demonstrated by its melting point (198-200°C).<br>
Since piroxicam molecule exhibits good membrane permeation<br>
characteristics, its low solubility is responsible for the slow dissolution rate in<br>
the gastro-intestinal fluids, which in turn results in slow absorption and delay<br>
in the onset of action.<br>
Slow dissolution can also exacerbate local side effects associated to the<br>
drug (e.g. gastric irritation).<br>
The handling of piroxicam is complicated due to its possible tautomeric<br>
switches and polymorphism. Said molecule can indeed exist in two<br>
polymorphic forms α and β, which have the same intramolecular structure<br><br>
EZE (I) but different intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions and<br>
in the pseudopolymorph which is the hydrate of the zwitter-ionic form ZZZ,<br>
one of the possible resonance forms of which is represented by formula (II)<br><br>
An efficient method for overcoming the problems related to the low<br>
solubility of piroxicam relies on the preparation of inclusion complexes with<br>
cyclodextrins as claimed in EP 153998. Hereinafter, the terms complexes,<br>
inclusion complexes and inclusion compounds are used as synonyms.<br>
Cyclodextrins (CDs) are natural cyclic oligosaccharides having a torus-<br>
like macro-ring shape obtained by enzymatic degradation of starch. The three<br>
major cyclodextrins consist of 6(α), 7(β) or 8(γ) (1→4) D-glucopyranosidic<br>
units. Among them, PCD turned out to be the most useful for complexing<br>
piroxicam.<br>
The solubilisation kinetic in water of piroxicam, released from the<br>
inclusion complex with β-cyclodextrin in the preferred molar ratio of 1 to 2.5,<br>
is the fastest of any other piroxicam obtained through any technological<br>
modification of the crystalline form known so far.<br>
For solubilisation kinetic we mean the time to reach the highest<br>
concentration of dissolved piroxicam after dispersion in water of the inclusion<br>
complex in the form of a powder.<br>
The 1:2.5 piroxicam:β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex (in the following<br>
1:2.5 PβCD), having the molecular formula C15H13N3O4S*2.5 C42H70O35 and a<br><br>
molecular weight of 3168.912, has been also referred to as CHF 1194.<br>
The 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound, like piroxicam, exhibits anti-<br>
inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. As analgesic drug, it is<br>
indicated for the treatment of diseases such as dental pain, post-traumatic<br>
pain, headache and dysmenorrhoea. It is administered by oral route in the form<br>
of tablets or granules, preferably tablets.<br>
Pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that the oral<br>
absorption of piroxicam, from 1:2.5 PβCD tablets and granules is faster and<br>
more efficient than that from piroxicam capsules.<br>
In particular, the bioavailability of the active ingredient in terms of rate<br>
as well as of extent of absorption in the first two hours is significantly<br>
enhanced.<br>
As a consequence of the faster absorption the onset of action of<br>
piroxicam from'the 1:2.5 βCD complex is more rapid making the product<br>
particularly effective as analgesic. It has been observed that to ensure the best<br>
performances in terms of dissolution rate and hence rapid absorption of<br>
piroxicam following the administration of 1:2.5 PβCD tablets, the powdery<br>
raw material should be able to produce after dispersion in water a<br>
concentration of dissolved piroxicam equal to or higher than 0.4 g per 100 ml<br>
(0.4% w/v) within the first 15 minutes.<br>
The successful results achieved with the use of cyclodextrins rely on the<br>
fact that, through complexation, it is possible to obtain a stable amorphous<br>
structure; since the amorphous form has a larger surface area and its lattice<br>
energy is much less than in crystals, both wettability and aqueous solubility of<br>
piroxicam are increased. Amorphous piroxicam as such is, indeed, a<br>
metastable form which crystallises within few hours. Moreover, it has also<br>
been demonstrated by Raman studies that piroxicam, in the β-cyclodextrin<br>
inclusion compound, assumes a zwitter-ionic structure with positive and<br><br>
negative charges delocalized similar to that of the hydrate pseudopolymorph<br>
(II). This structure is stabilized due to the chemical interaction with<br>
β-cyclodextrin via electrostatic and hydrogen bonds. The dipolar character of<br>
the zwitter-ionic structure improves the solubilisation kinetics and instant<br>
solubility of piroxicam.<br>
Since the solubilisation kinetic in water of piroxicam also depends on<br>
the intramolecular structure assumed by piroxicam in the 1:2.5 PβCD<br>
inclusion compound, the relevant manufacturing process should be able to<br>
achieve the complete conversion of piroxicam in the zwitter-ionic form.<br>
Moreover, the manufacturing process should be able to achieve the<br>
completeness of the inclusion reaction as well as the complete amorphization<br>
of the whole product.<br>
On the other hand, an amorphous active substance may incur the risk of<br>
crystallisation during storage due to the presence of residual water. Once the<br>
amorphous substance is formulated under the form of solid pharmaceutical<br>
preparations such as tablets, said crystallization can be responsible for<br>
phenomena such as swelling or loss of hardness of the tablets. Therefore it is<br>
also very important that the manufacturing process yields an amorphous<br>
substance wherein the amount of residual water is the lowest as possible and<br>
in the case of 1:2.5 PβCD equal to or lower than 5% w/w, preferably equal to<br>
or lower than 4% w/w.<br>
In summary, a manufacturing process suitable for the preparation of the<br>
1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound in the form of powder should be able to give<br>
rise to:<br>
i) no significant degradation of the two ingredient, i.e. piroxicam and<br>
β-cyclodextrin;<br>
ii) completeness of the inclusion reaction;<br>
iii) complete amorphization;<br><br>
iv) complete conversion of piroxicam into the zwitter-ionic form;<br>
v) an amount of residual water equal to or lower than 5% w/w,<br>
preferably equal to or lower than 4% w/w.<br>
Moreover said process should provide a 1:2.5 PβCD able to produce,<br>
after dispersion of the powder in water, a concentration of dissolved<br>
piroxicam equal to or higher than 0.4 g per 100 ml (0.4% w/v) within the first<br>
15 minutes.<br>
As reported above, the latter characteristic, when 1:2.5 PβCD is utilised<br>
for the preparation of solid pharmaceutical formulations for oral<br>
administration, and in particular tablets, is of paramount importance for<br>
ensuring optimal performances in term of piroxicam dissolution rate.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Cyclodextrin inclusion complexes can be prepared by reaction between<br>
the components in the solid state or semi-solid state or liquid state.<br>
In the solid state method, the two components may be optionally<br>
screened to uniform particle size and thoroughly mixed whereafter they are<br>
ground in a high-energy mill with optional heating, screened and<br>
homogenized.<br>
In the semi-solid state, the two components are kneaded in the presence<br>
of small amounts of a suitable solvent, and the resulting complex is oven<br>
dried, screened and homogenized.<br>
The complex formation in the liquid state is accomplished, in general<br>
terms, by dissolving the cyclodextrin and the drug in a suitable solvent and<br>
subsequently isolating the solid state complex by crystallization, evaporation,<br>
spray-drying or freeze-drying (lyophilization).<br>
In particular freeze-drying and spray-drying are methods applicable on<br>
industrial scale.<br>
Freeze-drying is the process of removing water from a product by<br><br>
sublimation, i.e. at a product temperature that is lower than its eutectic<br>
temperature.<br>
In WO 03/105906 the applicant described a process for the preparation<br>
of 1:2.5 PβCD by freeze-drying on an industrial scale wherein a diluted<br>
aqueous solution of two components, piroxicam and β-cyclodextrin is<br>
subjected, before drying, to a freezing process at a very high rate.<br>
Although it is very convenient for potentially thermolabile molecules<br>
such as piroxicam and β-cyclodextrin since it does not envision heating,<br>
freeze-drying involves a rather length step of removing a large amount of<br>
water by sublimation.<br>
Spray-drying can constitute an alternative process of removing water<br>
from a product. It can be faster than freeze-drying but it requires heating so it<br>
could present some drawbacks when applied to potentially thermolabile<br>
molecules such as piroxicam and β-cyclodextrin.<br>
Basically spray-drying is accomplished by atomizing a pre-heated<br>
solution (preferably an aqueous solution) into the drying chamber of the<br>
spray-drier apparatus where the small droplets are subjected to a stream of<br>
temperature-controlled hot gas and converted to powder particles. As the<br>
powder is discharged for the drying chamber, it is passed through a<br>
powder/gas separator, for example a cyclone, where it is further dried and<br>
collected.<br>
The parameters which can be adjusted for obtaining a powder with well<br>
defined characteristics are: i) the type of atomizing device; ii) the temperature<br>
of the inlet gas used to dry the sprayed material in the drying chamber<br>
(hereinafter referred to as inlet temperature); iii) the gas flow rate and iv) the<br>
flow rate of the feed solution (hereinafter the feed flow rate). Another<br>
important parameter which affect the final moisture content of the powder is<br>
the temperature of the drying gas coming out from the spray-drying chamber<br><br>
(hereinafter referred to as outlet temperature).<br>
The preparation of inclusion complexes of piroxicam with cyclodextrins<br>
by spray-drying on a lab scale is mentioned in several documents of the prior<br>
art. But the experimental conditions are not disclosed or, when disclosed,<br>
came out not suitable for preparing a 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound which<br>
fulfills the requirements previously illustrated.<br>
EP 153998 generically discloses that complexes of piroxicam and<br>
cyclodextrins in a molar ratio comprised between 1:1 and 1:10 can be<br>
prepared in different ways:<br>
a)	by crystallization from an aqueous or an organic/aqueous solution<br>
containing the two ingredients;<br>
b)	by evaporation of a water/ammonia solution;<br>
c)	by freeze-drying or atomization in air stream (spray drying) of a<br>
water/ammonia solution.<br>
All the examples refer to preparations of 1:2.5 PβCD on a lab scale<br>
(from milligram to grams). The conditions for obtaining the product by<br>
spray-drying are not reported.<br>
EP 449167 discloses a process for preparing inclusion complexes of<br>
piroxicam with β-cyclodextrin characterized in that the two ingredients, both<br>
in powder form, are mixed together, then co-ground in a high-energy mill<br>
whose grinding chamber has been saturated with steam. In the example 2 of<br>
EP 449167, the dissolution rate of tablets containing as active ingredient the<br>
1:2.5 PβCD prepared according to the claimed process was compared with<br>
that of analogous pharmaceutical composition containing the same active<br>
ingredient obtained by different methods, including spray drying and with a<br>
piroxicam composition in the form of capsules available on the market. The<br>
conditions for obtaining the product by spray-drying are not reported.<br>
In Acerbi D et al (Drug Invest 1990, 2, Suppl. 4, 29-36), a flow-chart<br><br>
showing the manufacturing process(es) for 1:2.5 PβCD is sketched. As far as<br>
spray-drying process is concerned, no conditions are reported except for the<br>
temperature of the βCD aqueous solution (65°C-70°C) before it is added to the<br>
apparatus. Moreover, as it can be appreciated from Figure 7 dealing with the<br>
solubilisation curves of piroxicam from complexes prepared with different<br>
methods, 1:2.5 PβCD obtained by spray-drying, after dispersion of the<br>
powder, gives rise to a maximum concentration of dissolved piroxicam of only<br>
about 0.03 g per 100 ml of water within the first five minutes (0.03% w/v).<br>
Pezoa R et al (Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on<br>
Pharmaceutical Technology, June, 2-4, 1992, Paris) reports the<br>
characterization of 1:1 PβCD complex obtained by freeze-drying and spray-<br>
drying methods. Experimental conditions are reported neither for<br>
freeze-drying nor for spray-drying. In the paper, it is generically stated that<br>
the dissolution profile of hard gelatine capsules containing the spray-dried<br>
complex shows a significant increase in the rate of dissolution but less than<br>
those containing the freeze-dried complex.<br>
Pavlova A V et al (Analyt Lab 1995, 4, 87-91) concerns the analytical<br>
characterization of 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion complexes prepared in different<br>
ways. Among other methods, the inclusion complex was prepared by<br>
spray-drying but no conditions are reported.<br>
In Van Hees T et al (Proceeding of the Ninth International Symposium<br>
on Cyclodextrins, Kluwer, 1999, 211-214), a comparative study of the<br>
dissolution properties of inclusion complexes of piroxicam with<br>
β-cyclodextrin prepared by different methods is reported. Complexes were<br>
prepared by supercritical CO2, freeze-drying and spray-drying. The conditions<br>
for obtaining the product by spray-drying are not reported. The dissolution or<br>
solubilisation kinetic was determined on the spray-dried substance in a USP<br>
XXIII N. 2 dissolution apparatus using 500 ml of solutions at pH 1.2 and pH<br><br>
6.8. Within the first 15 min, very low amounts of piroxicam, of about 30 mg<br>
and about 50 mg per 100 ml, were dissolved corresponding to concentrations<br>
of 0.03% and 0.05% w/v.<br>
In Kata M et al (Proceedings of the 10th International Cyclodextrin<br>
Symposium, Wacker, 2000, 629-634) inclusion compounds of piroxicam:<br>
β-cyclodextrin in four different molar ratios (2:1, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) were<br>
prepared by spray-drying using a lab scale apparatus (Niro Minor atomizer).<br>
The powder mixtures were dissolved in dimethylformamide and water and<br>
submitted to spray-drying under the following conditions: feed flow rate:<br>
600 ml/h (i.e. 0.6 1/h), temperature of inlet air: 155°C; temperature of outlet<br>
air: 90°C; pressure: 3 atm (corresponding to about 3 bar).<br>
In Lin S-Y et al (Int J Pharm 1989, 56. 249-259) a 1:1 PβCD was<br>
prepared by spray-drying under the following conditions: inlet temperature:<br>
145 ± 1°C, outlet temperature: 75± 1°C, drying (gas) flow rate: 0.37 mVmin<br>
(i.e. approximately 22 kg/h), atomizing air pressure: 1.0 kg/cm2 (i.e.<br>
approximately 1 bar), sample feeding speed (feed flow rate): 4.5 ml/min (i.e.<br>
0.27 1/h). The product turned out to be amorphous. The dissolution rate of the<br>
tablets prepared with the spray-dried product, carried out using the USP XXI<br>
paddle dissolution method at a rotational speed of 50 r.p.m. and at a<br>
temperature of 37°C, was faster than that of the physical mixture and pure<br>
drug but, as it can be appreciated from Figure 6(A) only about 20% of the<br>
amount of piroxicam was released after 30 minutes.<br>
In Kata M and Lin S-Y processes, the outlet temperature is of 90°C or<br>
less.<br>
As reported on page 4 of the present application, the 1:2.5 PβCD solid<br>
material to be utilised for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations such<br>
as tablets should have a residual water equal to or lower than 5% w/w. <br>
According to the findings of the applicant, outlet temperatures such as<br><br>
those reported in the above mentioned papers are too low for obtaining a<br>
product meeting said specification.<br>
Therefore both Kata M and Lin S-Y disclose conditions not suitable for<br>
preparing 1:2.5 PβCD which fulfills the requirements previously mentioned in<br>
terms of residual water and solubilisation kinetic.<br>
Van Hees T et al Pharm Res 1999, 16, 1864-1870 deals with the<br>
application of supercritical carbon dioxide for the preparation of a 1:2.5 PβCD<br>
inclusion compound. For comparison 1:2.5 PβCD was also prepared using the<br>
lab scale apparatus "Niro mobile minor™ spray-dryer", by applying the<br>
following conditions: inlet temperature of 175°C, feed flow rate of 15 ml/min<br>
(i.e. 0.9 1/h) and spray pressure of 0.2-0.3 MPa (corresponding to 2-3 baT).<br>
In Table II, said spray-dried 1:2.5 PβCD turned out to include an<br>
amount of water of 4.4%. However, the paper is silent about the gas flow rate<br>
and the outlet temperature, that are parameters of paramount importance in<br>
order to obtain a 1:2.5 PβCD complex capable to ensure the desired<br>
solubilisation kinetic of piroxicam.<br>
In view of the prior art, it would be highly advantageous to provide a<br>
process for preparing 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound by spray-drying,<br>
applicable on a pilot or an industrial scale, said process being able to give rise<br>
to:<br>
i) no significant degradation of the two ingredient, i.e. piroxicam and<br>
β-cyclodextrin;<br>
ii) completeness of the inclusion reaction;<br>
iii) complete amorphization;<br>
iv) complete conversion of piroxicam into the zwitter-ionic form;<br>
v) an amount of residual water equal to or lower than 5% w/w<br>
preferably equal to or lower than 4% w/w.	<br>
Moreover it would be even more advantageous to provide a<br><br>
spray-drying process which yields a 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound able to<br>
produce, after dispersion of the powder in water, a concentration of dissolved<br>
piroxicam equal to or higher than 0.4 g per 100 ml (0.4% w/v) within the first<br>
15 minutes.<br>
THE OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for the preparation of a<br>
1:2.5 piroxicam:β-cyclodextrin (1:2.5 PβCD) inclusion compound hy<br>
spray-drying, said process comprising the following steps:<br>
i. dissolving piroxicam and β-cyclodextrin in the 1 to 2.5 molar ratio<br>
in hot water in the presence of ammonium hydroxide;<br>
ii. feeding the resulting aqueous solution into the drying chamber of a<br>
spray-drier through an atomizing device to form droplets;<br>
iii. introducing a stream of pre-heated drying gas into the drying<br>
chamber to form powder particles;<br>
iv. further drying and separating the powder particles from the moist<br>
gas<br>
characterized in that in step iii) the temperature of the inlet drying gas (inlet<br>
temperature) is comprised between 165°C and 200°C and the temperature of<br>
 the outlet drying gas (outlet temperature) is comprised between 105°C and<br>
l30°C.<br>
We have found that in order to obtain a 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion<br>
compound which fulfills the requirements mentioned before, it is necessary to<br>
strictly control both the inlet and the outlet temperatures in the drying<br>
chamber.<br>
In particular, we have found that by applying an inlet temperature<br>
higher than 200°C, it is not possible to achieve after dispersion of the 1:2.5<br>
PβCD powder in water a concentration of dissolved piroxicam equal to or<br>
higher than 0.4 g per 100 ml within the first 15 minutes. On the other hand, we<br><br>
have also found that if the outlet temperature is lower than 105°C, it would<br>
not be possible to obtain a residual amount of water lower than 5% w/w.<br>
Therefore the inlet temperature should be set to a value of at least 165°C and,<br>
after suitably adjusting other parameters such as the flow rate of the feed<br>
aqueous solution and the gas flow rate, the outlet temperature in the drying<br>
chamber should be equal to or higher than the critical value of 105°C.<br>
By operating in the ranges of temperatures of the invention, piroxicam<br>
remains chemically stable and no significant degradation products of 1:2.5<br>
PβCD were observed.<br>
The present invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions<br>
containing as active ingredient, 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound obtainable by<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The characteristics of the process of the invention for preparing 1:2.5<br>
PβCD inclusion compound on a pilot or industrial scale by spray-drying will<br>
be more apparent from the following detailed description.<br>
For pilot or industrial scale, we mean the preparation of batches of at<br>
least 10 kg, preferably from 10 kg to 300 kg.<br>
Spray-drier apparatus in a wide variety of sizes and configurations can<br>
be used as currently supplied by commercially suppliers. The diagram in<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a typical spray-drying apparatus.<br>
In a first step, piroxicam and β-cyclodextrin in the 1:2.5 molar ratio and<br>
ammonium hydroxide are added to a tank containing water brought to a<br>
temperature higher than 60°C, preferably higher than 70°C, more preferably<br>
between 70°C and 80°C, then mixed until dissolution. Advantageously the<br>
concentration of piroxicam in water shall be of about 2% w/v and that of<br>
β-cyclodextrin shall be of about 17% w/v. Advantageously concentrated<br>
ammonium hydroxide is added, preferably in a cone, of 28-30% w/w and in a<br><br>
1:1 ratio w/w with respect to piroxicam.<br>
In a second step the hot solution is loaded with a fluid pump (1 in<br>
Figure 1) through an atomizing device (2) into the drying chamber (7) of the<br>
spray-drier.<br>
In the Example of the present invention, a pressure atomizing device<br>
was used and the process parameters of the spray-dryer were adjusted<br>
accordingly, in order to achieve an outlet temperature comprised between<br>
105°C and 130°C.<br>
The pressure atomizing device can consist of a single or a plurality of<br>
nozzles through which the solution is forced by the pump breaking up into<br>
droplets. When a pressure atomizing device consisting of a single nozzle is<br>
used, advantageously the pressure of the nozzle will be comprised between 10<br>
and 350 bar, preferably between 20 and 200 bar. Typically, the nozzle shall<br>
have an internal diameter of 0.5 to 0.7 mm.<br>
For the spraying process, other kinds of atomizing device such as a<br>
rotary (centrifugal) atomizing device or other suitable devices can be used.<br>
The person skilled in the art will adapt the various process conditions and<br>
parameters accordingly.<br>
The rotary (centrifugal) atomizing device, for example, is a spinning<br>
disk assembly with radial or curved plates which rotates at high velocities,<br>
usually comprised between 15000 and 25000 r.p.m. The solution is delivered<br>
near the center and spreads between the two plates and is accelerated to high<br>
linear velocities before it is thrown off the disk in the form of droplets.<br>
In the drying chamber, the droplets meet a stream of hot gas and they<br>
loose their moisture very rapidly while still suspended in the drying gas.<br>
While no particular restrictions are placed on the gas used to dry the sprayed<br>
solution, it is advantageous to use air, nitrogen gas or an inert gas, preferably<br>
air, more preferably with a residual moisture content equal to or lower than<br><br>
7000 p.p.m. The gas is electrically heated (5) and can be introduced via a<br>
suitable distributor (6).<br>
The heated gas stream may flow concurrently with the droplets, but it<br>
would also be possible to employ counter-current flow, cross-current flow, or<br>
other flow patterns.<br>
Advantageously the inlet temperature in the drying chamber of the<br>
spray-drier will vary between 165°C and 200°C, more advantageously<br>
between 170°C and 200°C, preferably between 175°C and 195°C, more<br>
preferably between 178°C and 182°C.<br>
The outlet temperature in the drying chamber shall be comprised<br>
between 105°C and 130°C, preferably between 110CC and 120°C, even more<br>
preferably between 112°C and 115°C.<br>
In order to prepare an amount of inclusion complex of about 10 kg, the<br>
spray-drying process of the invention is carried out by applying a feed flow<br>
rate of at least 12 kg/h (approximately 12 1/h). For a higher amount, the feed<br>
flow rate shall be comprised between 12 kg/h and 200 ton/h, preferably<br>
between 12 kg/h and 300 kg/h.<br>
Analogously, the flow rate of the drying gas is of at least 80 Kg/h,<br>
preferably 100 Kg/h, more preferably 300 Kg/h, even more preferably of at<br>
least 600 kg/h.<br>
For higher amounts, the gas flow rate shall be comprised between<br>
600 kg/h and 30 ton/h.<br>
Once defined the inlet and outlet temperature ranges provided by the<br>
present invention, the other process parameters shall be properly and mutually<br>
adjusted by the person skilled in the art on the basis of the size of the batch.<br>
In the example that follows, for a batch of about 10 kg of 1:2.5 PβCD,<br>
an inlet temperature of between 178°C and 182°C, a nozzle of 0.5 mm with a<br>
pressure of 21 bar, a feed flow of 12 kg/h (approximately 12 1/h) and a air<br><br>
flow rate of 600 kg/h are used in order to achieve the suitable outlet<br>
temperature of 112°C-115°C.<br>
Advantageously the difference between the inlet and the outlet<br>
temperatures is comprised between 45°C and 95°C, preferably between 65°C<br>
and 75°C.<br>
The powder is dried and separated from the moist gas in a cyclone (8)<br>
by centrifugal action. The centrifugal action is caused by the great increase in<br>
gas speed when the mixture of powder particles and gas enters into the<br>
cyclone. The dense powder particles are forced toward the cyclone walls and<br>
the product is collected under the cyclone on a vessel (9) through a<br>
discharging device such as a rotary valve. The lighter particles of moist gas<br>
are aspirated away by an aspirator (10) through the exhaust pipes.<br>
Alternatively, separation may be achieved by using a filter medium<br>
such as a membrane medium (bag filter), a sintered metal fiber filter, or the<br>
like.<br>
In the amorphous 1:2.5 PβCD inclusion compound obtainable by the<br>
process of the present invention piroxicam is completely present in the<br>
zwitter-ionic form and it can be characterized by its Raman spectrum, X-ray<br>
powder diffraction pattern and thermal behavior which are reported in the PCT<br>
application n. WO 03/105906.<br>
The FT-Raman spectrum, obtained by simply packing the powder into a<br>
cup, shows the following main peaks in the 165β-1000 cm-1 range (accuracy<br>
± 1 cm-1):<br>
1613 cm-1 (sh), 1593 (s), 1578 (sh), 1561 (w), 1525 (br), 1519 (br),<br>
1464 (m), 1436 (m), 1394 (s), 1331 (brm)/1306 (sh), 1280 (w), 1260 (w), 1234<br>
(w), 1217 (vw), 1186 (w), 1158 (m), 1119 (m), 1083 (w), 1053 (w), 1036 (w),<br>
992 (w), 947 (brw).<br>
Legend: sh = shoulder; s = strong; m = medium; w = weak; vw = very<br><br>
weak; br = broad, brm = broad medium, brw - broad weak.<br>
The amount of residual water in the 1:2.5 PβCD obtainable by the<br>
process of the present invention can be determined by Karl-Fisher method and<br>
it should be equal or lower than 5% w/w, preferably equal to or lower than 4%<br>
w/w. Since 1:2.5 PβCD tends to absorb water, the determination should be<br>
carried out as soon as the product is obtained and in any case after protection<br>
from moisture ingress.<br>
The solubilisation kinetic of piroxicam from the 1:2.5 PβCD shall be<br>
determined according to the dispersed powder method reported in the<br>
following Example 2.<br>
Advantageously, the concentration of dissolved piroxicam within the<br>
first 15 minutes shall be equal to or higher than 0.4% w/v, preferably equal to<br>
or higher than 0.5% w/v.<br>
The 1:2.5 PβCD obtainable with the process of the invention can be<br>
advantageously used to prepare pharmaceutical compositions having<br>
analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic activity, for the oral<br>
administration, preferably in the form of tablets, effervescent tablets or<br>
sachets for oral administration, more preferably in the form of tablets.<br>
Advantageously the tablets for oral administration contain between<br>
50 mg and 200 mg of the 1:2.5 PβCD complex per unit dose, preferably<br>
95.6 mg or 191.2 mg (corresponding to 10 and 20 mg of piroxicam,<br>
respectively) in admixture with suitable excipients such as lactose,<br>
crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, silica, starch and magnesium stearate.<br>
The following examples better illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of 1:2.5 PβCD by spray-drying<br>
About 50 litres of water was poured into a tank and heated up to a<br>
temperature of 73°C-75°C.<br>
8.6 kg (7.57 moles) of β-cyclodextrin, 1 kg (3.02 moles) of piroxicam<br><br>
and 1 kg of 28% ammonium hydroxide were added in succession, and the<br>
mixture stirred for 30 min. The solution was filtered using a 55 µm filter and<br>
loaded into a spray dryer Niro. The following process parameters were used:<br>
nozzle diameter: 0.5 mm; nozzle pressure: 21 bar; air flow rate: 600 kg/h; feed<br>
flow rate: 12 kg/h (approximately 12 1/h); inlet temperature: 182°C; outlet<br>
temperature: 113°C.<br>
The 1:2.5 PβCD product in the form of free-flowing powder was<br>
collected under the cyclone through a rotary valve.<br>
The resulting product shows the thermal curve and the Raman spectrum<br>
reported respectively in Figures 2 and 3, which arc typical of a 1:2.5 PβCD<br>
wherein a complete inclusion complex reaction has occurred and piroxicam is<br>
present in the zwitter-ionic form. Powder X-ray analysis shows the diffused<br>
diffraction pattern typical of amorphous products, After HPLC analysis, no<br>
significant amount of degradation products of piroxicam was detected.<br>
The residual amount of water was 3.8% w/w as determined by Karl<br>
Fischer method.<br>
Example 2 - Solubilisation kinetic of piroxicam from 1:2.5 PβCD<br>
prepared in the Example 1<br>
The solubilisation kinetic was determined according to the dispersed<br>
powder method.<br>
In a dissolution test apparatus Sotax A76, 250 ml of water were<br>
introduced and the temperature was set at 37°C ± 0.5°C. Then, 20 g of PβCD<br>
as obtained in the Example 1, corresponding to about 2 g of piroxicam, was<br>
added and the resulting dispersion was maintained under stirring at 125 r.p.m.<br>
After 15 minutes, an aliquot of the solution was withdrawn and filtered. The<br>
concentration of dissolved piroxicam, measured by UV spectrophotometry,<br>
turned out to be 0.5 g per 100 ml, i.e. 0.5% w/v.<br><br>
