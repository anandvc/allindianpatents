(2) Description of the Prior Art<br>
A refrigerant duct for a refrigerator directs the flow of a refrigerant by mutually connecting components for the refrigeration cycle to one another. A part of the refrigerant duct ia extended to form a condenser for making the refrigerant, flowing thereinto, be condensed. The refrigerant duct is installed in the main body of the refrigerator, and is bent to enhance the condensing effect.<br>
However, since a device for bending the refrigerant duct i&amp; fixedly installed on a predetermined position in the conventional refrigersitor, in order to bend a refrigerant duct of different length, an extra bending device  is needed ar a worker has to change the position of the device, fixedly installed and then fix it again. The refrigerant duct is bent from the outside to the inside, which makes it difficult to fix the bent refrigerant duct when bending the inside of the refrigerant duct. In addition, it is difficult to bend a specified portion of the unstably fixed refrigerant duct by an exact angle.<br>
SUMMARY   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a refrigerant duct bending device for a refrigerator that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>

The first bender includes first and second jigs mounted on one side of the refrigerant duct spaced a given distance away from each other, and a third jig mounted on the other side of the refrigerant duct to make a rectilinear reciprocation between the first and second jigs. The second bender includes first;and<br>
second jigs mounted on one side of the refrigerant duct spaced a given distance away from each other, and a third jig mounted on the other side of the refrigerant duct to make a rotating motion between the first and second jigs.<br>

DETATLED   DESCRIPTION  OF   PREFERED   EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
PIG. 1 is a perspective view of an outer case of a refrigerator with a refrigerant duct bent in accordance with the present invention, and, as shown in PIG. 1, a refrigerant duct 100 is provided to the inside of each of both side wall panels 120 and 130 and an upper panel 110. The refrigerant duct 100 of predetermined length is bent several times to be attached to the inside of the respective panels to produce condensation of the refrigerant .<br>
FIGS. 2 to 7 each depict the operating state of the bending device in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The right and left parts of the inventive bending device are symmetrical to each other, and one side of the bending device ie shown in. FIGS. 2 to 7 and will be described throughout the specification. All the directions to be described hereinafter, are set on the basie of the refrigerant duct 10 as follows: a direction of the length - a direction of the length of the<br><br>
refrigerant duct 10; a vertically right-angled direction - a vertical direction of the'refrigerant duct 10 (a direction of its upper part) ; a horizontally right-angled direction - a horizontal direction of the refrigerant duct 10 (forward and backward).<br>
The refrigerant duct bending device of the present invention<br>
includes a pair of first rails 61 installed extending to<br>
correspond to the length of the refrigerant duct 10, a first<br>
bender 20 installed at the right side of the rails 61 (actually,<br>
at the middle of the rails 61) for bending the refrigerant duct<br>
10 in a horizontally right-angled direction, a second bender 30<br>
for bending the left side of the refrigerant duct 10 in a<br>
vertically right-angled direction, a third bender 40 movably<br>
disposed between the first and second benders 20 and 30 for<br>
bending the refrigerant duct 10 to make one portion of the<br>
refrigerant duct 10, bent by the first bender 20 be right angles<br>
with another portion bent by the second bender 30, and a fourth<br>
bender 50 movably mounted between the third bender 40 and the<br>
first bender 20 for bending the refrigerant duct 10 to make the<br>
portions, each bent by the first and second benders 20 and 30,<br>
be horizontal.  The first bender 20 produces a first bending to<br>
the refrigerant duct 10, and includes a first jig 21 and a second<br>
jig 22, each disposed at the right side of the first rails and<br>
at the rear of the refrigerant duct 10, and a third jig 23 which<br>
can rectilinearly reciprocate between the first and second jigs<br>
21 and 22.  The first, second and third jigs 21, 22 and 23 are<br>
each in a cylindrical shape, around which the refrigerant duct<br>
is wound.<br>
The second bender 30, disposed at the right side of the<br>
r,<br>
first rail 61, includes a first jig 31 installed closely contacting the upper part of the refrigerant duct 10, a second jig 32 mounted at the left side of the,refrigerant duct 10, and a third jig 33 installed under the refrigerant duct 10 to make a rotating motion between the first and second jigs 31 and 32. The third jig 33 rotates clockwise, and a second bending created by the refrigerant duct 10 depends on an angle of rotation of the third jig 33. The third bender 40 produces a third bending to the refrigerant duct 10. This third bender 40 includes a first jig 41, connected to the second rail 62, connected with the first rails 61, to be movable in a horizontally right-angled direction, and a second jig 42 interposed between the first and second benders .20 and 30. The first jig 41 is connected to the second rail 62 whose both ends are connected with a pair of the first rail 61 and can reciprocate, to make a reciprocating motion, thus rotating clockwise.<br>
The fourth bender 50 produces a fourth bending to the refrigerant duct 10, and includes a second jig 52 that is positioned at the right side of the second jig 42 of the third bender 40, and a first jig 51 which is rotatable about th« second jig 52 to bend the refrigerant duct 10 by 90°.<br>
The benders 20, 30, 40 and 50 are installed movably in a direction of the length of the refrigerant duct 10, thus controlling the bent portions of the refrigerant duct 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, the inventive refrigerant duct bending device i:3 now described.<br>
The refrigerant duct 10 is provided from the left side of<br>
the first rails 61, and is fixed in position. That is, the refrigerant duct 10 is compressed between the first and second jigs 21 and 22 of the first bender 20 and its third jig 23, and the first and second jige 31 and 32 of the second bender 30 and its third jig 33, thus being fixed in position (FIG. 2).<br>
The first bending is carried out by the first bender 20, and the third jig 23 of the first bender 20 makes a rectilinear motion between the first and second jigs 21 and 22 in a horizontally right-angled direction, so the refrigerant duct 10 is bent in the horizontally right-angled direction, i.e. into a  shape by the first, second and third jigs 21, 22 and 23 (FIG. 3).<br>
The second bending is performed by the second bender 30, and the third jig 33, positioned under the refrigerant duct 10, rotates clockwise between the first and second jigs 31 and 32, thus bending the refrigerant duct 10 in a vertically right-angled direction, i.e. into an "S" shape (FIGS. 4A and 4B) .<br>
The third bender 40 produces the third bending to the refrigerant duct 10. As the first jig 41 rotates clockwise, the refrigerant duct 10 is bent backward by 90°. The rotation of the first jig 41 is moved to the rear of the second rail 62, simultaneously with the second rail 62's moving to the right side of the first rails 61 (FIG. 5) . <br>
According to the tourtn bending, the left part of the 90" bent refrigerant duct 10 is 90° bent again by the fourth bender 50, thus making the first bent portion and second bent portion be arrar.god side by side. That is, the first jig 51 of the fourth bender 50 bents the refrigerant duct 10 between the first<br>
and second jigs 41 and 42 of the third bender 40 by 90°, and the left part of the refrigerant duct 10 is 90° bent on the basis of the second jig 52, thus making the first and second bent portions be positioned side by side.<br>
The refrigerant duct 10 that has been bent in the above manner is transferred to an outer case of a refrigerator by tweezers to be installed therein.<br>
As described above, the refrigerant duct bending device of the present invention first bents the middle and outside portions of the refrigerant duct and then bents their middle portion, thus preventing dislocation of the refrigerant duct during bending and exactly controlling the bent portions and an angle of bending. In addition, the angle of bending can be regulated by controlling the rotation or movement of the respective jigs.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
