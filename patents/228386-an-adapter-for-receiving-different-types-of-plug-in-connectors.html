				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an adapter in the manner of a coupling, which can be<br>
inserted into a front panel from a front side and can be arrested by a spring, for<br>
optical-fiber plug-in connectors with a one-piece or two-piece housing, which has<br>
at least on one side a flange protruding from the cross section of the housing for<br>
abutment on the front panel, at least one plug-in connector receptacle at the<br>
front and/or rear with respect to the front panel and at least one positively<br>
locking releasable arresting mechanism for plug- in connectors.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Couplings or adapters for optical-fiber plugs connect optical fibers for laser light.<br>
Couplings of this type are usually fixed in a housing wall or front panel, with the<br>
result that plug receptacles foe optical-fiber plugs are provided on both sides of<br>
the front panel. Until recently, optical-fiber connectors of this type were<br>
frequently produced in the form of SC plugs or SC connectors.<br>
However, these are increasingly being replaced by smaller forms with the<br>
designations LX.5, LC and MU. LC connectors are standardized in IEC 61751-20<br>
and MU connectors are standardized in IEC 61751-6. LX.5 plugs have not yet<br><br>
been standardized; LX.5 is a registered trademark of the company ADC<br>
Telecommunications, Inc. US.<br>
SC connectors and corresponding couplings are disclosed in USA 5,317,663. The<br>
plug-in connectors are held in the coupling on both sides by blocking cams,<br>
which engage in depressions on both sides of the connector when the optical-<br>
fiber centering devices have reached their desired position. The adapters there,<br>
for SC-simplex connectors, are provided with shutters against laser light,<br>
arranged in the coupling.<br>
A coupling of the type 'BSC II-Adapter with Shutter", for a SC connector, could<br>
be seen on the Internet on August 6, 2001 at 15.35 under the address<br>
http://www.molex.com. A shutter is understood as meaning a pivotably attached<br>
flap in front of a plug-receptacle opening, which is intended to prevent a fitter<br>
from being injured by laser light during the insertion of SC connectors. The<br>
shutter has a warning about lasers.<br>
EP 0 590 586 A1 discloses a coupling made up of two parts for two MU<br>
connectors, a reduced-size further development of the SC connector which can<br>
be fastened on a front panel by means of flanges projecting from one side of the<br>
coupling, with a sponging-back next to the flange arresting the coupling behind<br>
the front panel after it has been pushed into a corresponding opening. The plug-<br>
in connector is held in the coupling in a way similar to the SC connector.<br><br>
WO 00/16145 discloses fiberoptic connectors and couplings of the type<br>
described. Smaller forms of connector of the LX.5 type are presented, having at<br>
the front of the connector a cover which automatically opens as soon as a laser<br>
shutter against a return spring, arranged in the coupling, has been passed.<br>
During the insertion phase, a pin on the plug-in connector, protruding fixedly into<br>
the interior of the coupling, pushes open the cover held closed by a spring, in<br>
order that the optical fiber in the plug-in connector is exposed for conducting<br>
light to a plug-in connector lying opposite in the adapter. The connector engages<br>
with its two special cams on a resilient lever on the housing of the plug-in<br>
connector in a complementarily shaped catch on the coupling, which are<br>
arranged laterally of the longitudinal axis of the connector and of the coupling,<br>
respectively, and thereby hook into one another. The cams can be unlocked from<br>
their catch by means of the lever on the connector.<br>
LC connectors are also known from EP 1091226 A1. They have a locking and<br>
releasing lever mechanism arranged centrally on one side of the connector, by<br>
which a positive connection produced in the coupling when the connector is<br>
inserted can be released. The connection is produced by two keys arranged<br>
laterally on the lever, which engage in a keyway lying opposite in the coupling<br>
when the connector has reached its desired position in the coupling. These<br>
couplings also have flanges and a latching spring for mounting in a front panel.<br><br>
Instead of a large-sized SC coupling, it is possible to fit two couplings for LX.5,<br>
LC or MU connectors into a front panel. Although some of the plug-in connectors<br>
are standardized, on different systems of different users there are different plug-<br>
in connectors, which come together but do not fit into the same coupling.<br>
A universal adapter system for the plug-in connectors of the FC, ST, SC, SMA, D4<br>
and BICONIC types and a Universal Panel Mount Adapter, with which the ST or<br>
FC types can be coupled at a front panel to each other or to DIN or E2000 plug-<br>
in connectors. An adapter for the Coupling of MU types to LC types by simple<br>
mechanical screwing of slip-on ferrules for optical fibers with threaded rings also.<br>
The fitting and removal of the adapters is time-consuming and requires great<br>
dexterity, in particular in the case of eth small plug-in connectors, the ferrules cf<br>
which have diameters of only 1.25 mm, as compared with 2.5 mm in the case of<br>
the SC connectors.<br>
The known LC plugs and MU plugs with matching adapters for a simplex or<br>
duplex application, constitutes a Sc-LC adapter device, which can be attached to<br>
a front panel and has at the front a plug receptacle for a LC plug and at the rear<br>
a plug receptacle for a SC plug. This coupling cannot be released, or only<br>
laboriously, from the front side once it has been fitted into the front panel side<br>
and hooked behind the front panel by means of an expanding spring. This type<br>
of fastening is predominantly encountered in the case of all couplings that are<br>
not screwed on.<br><br>
In the case of the previous couplings and connectors, it is evident how they can<br>
be released from the front panel without separating the optical fiber connection.<br>
For this reason, the invention is based on the problem of providing an adapter,<br>
which has the advantages of the known plug-in connectors and couplings but<br>
avoids their disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The solution for an adapter of the generic type initially in that each plug<br>
connector receptacle has an opening for the alternate reception of at least two of<br>
three different types, LX.G, LC MU, of plug-in connectors and in each case an<br>
arresting mechanism suitable for the type.<br>
On account of the different arresting systems of the plug-in connectors and their<br>
position and shape and also function this solution is unknown and surprising, as<br>
demonstrated by the extensive prior art and worldwide proliferation of these<br>
types of plug-in connector.<br><br>
This solution can be realized most simply if the arresting mechanisms for the<br>
types LX.5 and LC arranged on the same side of the coupling and the arresting<br>
mechanism for the MU type is attached on other sides of the adapter, off set by<br>
90°.<br>
This also made possible the development to the extent that the adapter is<br>
designed as a simplex plug-in coupling for the alternate reception of all three<br>
types, while it is determined by the position of the ferrule the only adapters for<br>
the alternate reception of the plug types LX.5 and LC can be designed as a<br>
duplex plug-in coupling.<br>
The problem of accommodating the pin for actuating a cover of the plug type<br>
LX.5 was solved by said pin being arranged on a displaceable element on a side<br>
wall of the adapter, preferably by the displaceable element being formed in the<br>
side wall as an integral spring element. However, this element may also be<br>
designed differently, for example the pin may also be displaced by the plug-in<br>
connectors - apart from in the case of LX.5 - in the direction of insertion.<br>
Ina development of the invention, it is intended that the coupling is closed is<br>
need be, for protection against dust or protection from the laser light; according<br>
to the invention, by the fact that the opening of the receptacle can be closed by<br>
a cap which can be pivotably and releasably attached to the housing. For this<br>
purpose, the cap is preferably inserted into a snap-action device, for example a<br><br><br>
hole for an engaging stud, on the outside of the housing. For the purposed of<br>
inscription, such as concerning the type of plug-in connectors to be inserted or<br>
for a warning, the cap has no the outside a guide for the pushing in of an<br>
identification plate.<br>
Furthermore, the adapter is intended to be able to be fitted releasably in a front<br>
panel from the front side, for simple mounting and removal. For this purpose, in<br>
a way which is already inventive in itself, the adapter is provided with a latching<br>
spring, which is arranged on the housing and can be actuated from the front<br>
side, for gripping behind the front panel and releasing the latching spring from<br>
the front panel.<br>
The latching spring is preferably designed as an unsupported resilient tongue,<br>
which can extend through an opening in the flange and in the front panel. For<br>
mounting and establishing the coupling, in this case the latching spring has a<br>
spring frame, which grips around the housing on at least three sides, extends<br>
through the flange and has the resilient tongue as an integral part.<br>
In order that this type of design requires as little space as possible, the adapter<br>
is designed in such a way that the plug receptacles form the largest housing<br>
cross section at their openings and the housing surface is provided in the<br>
direction of the flange with set-back portions for the abutment of parts of the<br>
spring frame, the mounted spring frame not protruding beyond the cross section<br>
of the housing at the plug receptacle. A coupling attached in such a way can be<br>
removed from the front panel without interrupting the laser connection.<br><br><br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Identical designations refer to parts of an identical or similar function. The<br>
schematic representation of the parts is enlarged in comparison with reality by a<br>
factor of approximately 5 to 20.<br>
Figure 1 shows in principle a multiple offset longitudinal section through an<br>
empty coupling for optical-fibre connectors, designed here as a universal adapter<br>
3 with a common housing 30, made up of two mirror-invertedly identical front<br>
and rear housing parts 31 and 32, respectively. They meet at the flanges 41 and<br>
are, for example, adhesively bounded there or else are only held together by a<br><br><br>
latching spring 5 or the frame 50 of the latter; alternatively, a positive<br>
connection 34 (figure 3b) of the parts 31,32 is possible.<br>
The flanges 41, designed as stubs, allow a resilient tongue 51 to pass through<br>
centrally in a clearance on the surface 402 of the housing 4, said tongue being<br>
integrally attached to the metal spring frame 50 and its extended end 52 having<br>
a lug 53 projecting from it, which can engage behind a front panel 10 (figure 6)<br>
and consequently arrest the adapter 3 in the front panel. By pressure on the clip<br>
54, the lug 53 is released and the adapter can be pulled out form the front panel<br>
without the plug-in connectors having to be removed from the adapter 3.<br>
The housing, which may also be in one piece, has two plug-in connector<br>
receptacles 1 and 2 at the front and rear, respectively.<br>
In principle, this representation is identical for the simplex adapter according to<br>
figure 2 and the duplex adapter according to figure 6, apart from different wall<br>
thickness of the housing. The cross sections of the openings and the lateral<br>
guides in the walls of the adapter are tailor-made for the cross section of the<br>
plug-in connectors of the LX.5 and MU 7,8, 9 types.<br>
In extension of the openings of the plug-in connectors receptacles 1,2 a<br>
centering device 43 for the ferrule or light guide 20 is recessed in the housing<br><br><br>
(figures 3a, 3b). In order that a cannot inadvertently look into a laser beam, the<br>
adapter includes a laser shutter 44, which is kept in the shown blocking position<br>
by a spring 45 and can be pressed down by plug-in connectors or a cap (figure<br>
3a).<br>
A bore 46 serves for the engagement of a latching pin 61 of the cap 6,60 (figure<br>
3a) or 62 (figure 6).<br>
The cover pin 42 serves for opening the cover, not represented, of an LX.5 plug-<br>
in connector 8, as known per se known per se from the prior art. The cover pin<br>
42 is arranged at the end of an unsupportedly mounted, flexibly displaceable<br>
tongue 421, which is an integral part of the side wall 401 of the housing 30 and<br>
responds in a way still to be described in figures 4 and 5. The arresting<br>
mechanism 28 for LX.5 plug-in connectors 8 (figures 3b and 6) comprises on the<br>
housing 30 a catch 48, in the manner of a recess on the upper side 402 thereof,<br>
into which the two cams 81 on the flexible level 82 can engage.<br>
The arresting mechanism 29 for MU plug-in connectors 9 comprises a blocking<br>
cam 49 in the side wall 401 of the housing; this cam in a depression, not<br>
represented of the plug-in connector 9 and in this way arrests the letter in the<br>
coupling. The arresting mechanism 27 of the LC plug-in connector 7 is<br>
represented in figure 3a.<br><br><br>
Figure 2 shows the adapter 3' as a simplex connector, complete with cap 60 and<br>
LC plug-in connector 7 and latching spring 5'. It can clearly be seen that the<br>
simplex housing 40 has on its surface in the side wall 403 and the upper side<br>
402 between the flanges 41 and the largest housing cross section 33, close to<br>
the openings for the plug-in connector receptacles 1,2 a depression in which the<br>
spring frame 50 comes to bear and consequently does not protrude beyond the<br>
extent of the largest cross section 33 of the housing.<br>
Figure 3a show [sic] this simplex adapter 3' in longitudinal section with a cap 60<br>
at the receptacle 1 of the adapter and a fully inserted LC plug-in connector 7 at<br>
the rear receptacle 2, with the result that the light guide 20 lies centrally with<br>
respect to the centering device 43, and in [sic] figure 3b, on the other hand,<br>
without a cap, but with an inserted LX.5 plug-in connector 8.<br>
The LC plug-in connector 7 has at the arresting mechanism 27 on the plug<br>
housing 70 an arresting lever 73 with cams 72 on both sides, which engage<br>
behind a catch 47 on the housing 40 when the plug-in connector is in position<br>
shown. With the release lever 71, pressure can be exerted on the arresting lever<br>
73, with the result that the levers consisting of flexible plastic move downward<br>
and the cams 70 disengage from the catch 47, in order that the plug-in<br>
connector can be pulled.<br><br><br>
Figure 3b shows a similar situation for the fully inserted LX.5 plug-in connector 8,<br>
but for the sake of clarity without the cover. The light guides 20 and centering<br>
devices 43 lie in one axis; the arresting mechanism 28 is in operation. Attached<br>
to the release lever 81 of the plug housing 80 on both sides is a cam 82, which<br>
has engaged in the catch 48 of the adapter housing 40 and, after pressing down<br>
the flexible release lever 81, can be disengaged again.<br>
Figure 4 shows a duplex adapter 3" for the simultaneously and parallel<br>
connecting of two light guides 20 within a coupling housing 4.<br>
Figure 5 shows an adapter 3' analogous to figures 2, 3a, 3b with a partly<br>
inserted MU plug-in connector 9, but without its arresting mechanism, which was<br>
explained with respect to figure 1.<br>
In figure 4, an LX.5 plug-in connector 8 is represented at the top and an LC plug-<br>
in connector 7 is represented at the bottom. The cover pin 42, necessary for the<br>
universal plugging of connectors, has in the case of the LX.5 connector 8 a cam<br>
way 83 of its own and therefore remains in its position in relation to the housing<br>
4. In the case of eth LC connector 7 or MU connector 9 is [sic], on the other<br>
hand, the connector butts with an edge of its housing 70 or 90 against the cover<br>
pin 42 while the connectors are being pushed into the adapter. Figure 4a shows<br>
this situations as an enlarged, positionally correct detail, for the LC connector 7<br><br><br>
and mirror-invertedly for the MU connector 9 in accordance with the cover pin<br>
position in the circle. If the connectors are pushed further into the adapter, the<br>
flexible tongue 421 with the cover pin 42 is pushed to the side and clears the<br>
path for the plug-in connector 7 or 9. The side wall here comprises, for example,<br>
only the tongue 421, which is surrounded on the outside only by the spring<br>
frame 50 or 55.<br>
Figure 6 shows an adapter 3" with duplex housing 4, which has been fitted into<br>
an aperture 11 of a front panel 10 and arrested there by means of a spring<br>
frame 55, which surrounds the adapter 3"resting mechanism can be released by<br>
pressing the clip 54 of the spring 5' as already described in itself.<br>
Inserted at the rear, as represented in figure 4, are two connectors 7 and 8 of<br>
the LC and LX.5 types, respectively, while at the front a cap 62 closes the<br>
adapter or both its openings at the same time.<br>
The caps 6 in general, or 60 for simplex connectors and 62 for duplex connectors<br>
according to Figures 3a and 6, preferably consist of flexible plastic, have a<br>
latching pin 61 for clipping in and fastening in a bore 46 on the housing 4,30,40,<br>
a jointed flexible clip 63 for the pivoting away of the closure 64, 64' of cap, in<br>
order to clear or close the openings of the adapter, at the same time as a guard<br>
against dust and-in the case of adapters without a laser shutter 44 - also as an<br>
guard. The front part 65 has a guide 66, in order to insert there an identification<br>
plate 67, which is provided with an inscription or identification, concerning the<br>
type of the adapters, the plug-in connectors to be inserted or the like to hold<br>
