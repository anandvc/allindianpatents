SCHEDULE ELEMENT FRAME SYNCHRONIZATION IN WIRELESS NETWORKS<br>
The use of wireless connectivity in data and voice communications continues to increase. These devices include portable computers, computers in a wireless local area network (WLAN), portable handsets and the like. The wireless communication bandwidth has significantly increased with advances of channel modulation techniques, making the WLAN a viable alternative to wired and optical fiber solutions.<br>
IEEE 802.11 is a standard that covers the specification for the Medium Access Control (MAC) sub-layer and the Physical (PHY) layer of the WLAN.   While this standard has provided for significant improvement in the control of voice and data traffic, the continued increase in the demand for network access at increased channel rates while supporting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements have required a continuous evaluation of the standard and change thereto. For example, much effort has been placed on support for real-time multimedia services in WLAN's, particularly with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees.<br>
One technique used to attempt to coordinate the access/use of the operating channel of the WLAN is polling. Polling is a process where a QoS access point (QAP) sends a transmission to QoS Station (QSTA) with certain requirements such as the stream requirements. This is effectively a granting of permission from QAP to the QSTA to grant channel access rights for the indicated duration. The QSTA has a scheduled time for access and the minimum time between two successive scheduled service periods is known as a minimum service interval.    In the interim between the scheduled service intervals the QSTA may enter a power saving mode or conduct some internal processing, or both. For example, the QSTA may use the down time for other tasks, especially to conserve power. Without the knowledge of the commencement of the minimum service interval, the QSTA would have to remain in an active mode awaiting its next command by the QAP to begin access to a channel after a service period. This would be an inefficient use of resources.<br>
While the provision of the IEEE 802.1 IE specification for the polling sequence outlined above does advance the efficiency of the WLAN, there are, nonetheless, shortcomings. For example, the minimum service interval and the maximum service interval are referenced from the start of the first successful data or Contention Free (CF) QoS Poll (QoS(+)CF-Poll) transmission by the QAP (also referred to as the Hybrid Coordinator (HC)). Although a data frame or QoS(+)CF-Poll transmitted by the QAP may<br><br>
be received correctly by the QSTA, the required acknowledgement of the receipt may not be received properly by the QAP. As such, the QSTA sets the reference for the minimum service interval at the time prescribed in the poll and to the prescribed parameters set therein (the reference is from the start of a QoS(+)CF-Poll or a downlink transmission), while the QAP having not received the acknowledgement, retransmits the previous signal based on the assumption that the previous transmission was not received.<br>
However, because the QSTA has set the start of the minimum interval already, it may be, for example, at the end of the maximum service interval, in power save mode, so it will not receive the poll, and a protocol failure has occurred. That is, the synchronization of start of service periods between QAP and QSTA is broken.   Also, if the beginning of the service period is not synchronized from the perspective of the QSTA, after a maximum service duration from the beginning of the service period, the QSTA may enter power-save mode. However, because the start of the service period is not synchronized, with the QAP marking the start of the service period later than the QSTA, the maximum service duration ends later. Therefore, the QAP could continue transmitting data to QSTA while the QSTA is in power-save mode, resulting in a protocol failure. Therefore, there is need in the art to require QSTA to remain awake until it is explicitly told about the end of the service period.<br>
In addition to the ambiguity that can arise in the set-point of the start of minimum service interval, the end of the service period can also be ambiguous and result in a protocol failure even if the service period start times are synchronized. For example, if more than one transmission opportunities (TXOP's) are granted by QAP in a series of QoS(+)CF-Polls in one service period, then a QSTA, without the knowledge that a particular TXOP is the last one, would have to wait until the end of the maximum service duration before going into power-save mode. Of course, this can result in an unnecessary use of power by the QSTA.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method of polling and transmitting data and/or voice frames between the QAP and the QSTA's of a WLAN that overcomes at least the deficiencies of known techniques such as those described above.<br>
In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a method of transmitting frames from a first device of a wireless local area network (WLAN) to a second device of the WLAN includes sending a first frame including a first transmission indicator from the first device to the second device. The first transmission indicator indicates that a service<br><br>
interval is to begin at a certain time. The method also includes sending an acknowledgement from the second device to the first device indicating receipt of the first transmission indicator; and sending a second frame including another first transmission indicator if, after a prescribed time period, the acknowledgement is not received by the first device.<br>
In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, a wireless local area network includes a first device and a second device. The first device sends a first frame including a first transmission indicator, which indicates that a service interval is to begin at a certain time. The second device sends an acknowledgement from the second device to the first device indicating receipt of the first transmission indicator. The first device sends a second frame including another first transmission indicator if, after a prescribed time period, the acknowledgement is not received by the first device.<br>
The invention is best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawing figures. It is emphasized that the various features are not necessarily drawn to scale. In fact, the dimensions may be arbitrarily increased or decreased for clarity of discussion.<br>

In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, exemplary embodiments disclosing specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one having ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure, that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from the specific details disclosed herein. Moreover, descriptions of well-known devices, methods and materials may be omitted so as to not obscure the description of the present invention.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a WLAN 100 in accordance with an exemplar)7 embodiment The WLAN 100 includes at least one QAP 101, which is connected by wireless infrastructure (nor shown) to a plurality of QSTA's 102. It is noted that in the exemplary embodiment four QSTA's 102 are shown. This is done to promote clarity in the discussion of the exemplary embodiments. The QSTA's 102 are illustratively portable devices such as personal computers, consumer appliances, handsets, and other devices usefully connected in a WLAN. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the WLAN 100 and its elements substantially comply with the IEEE 802.11 standard, and its revisions and versions. The WLAN 100 also includes the modifications and improvements of the exemplary embodiments of the present application.<br>
In operation the QAP 101 dictates the communications between the various QSTA's 102. To this end, the QAP coordinates the transmission of voice and data by the QSTA's 102. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment the QSTA's 102 are connected to one another only through the QAP 101. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, the QSTA's may be in communication with one or more QSTA's without having to transmit first to the QAP 101. The former is known as an uplink, while the latter is referred to as a direct link. While these aspects of the WLAN 100 are germane to a general understanding of the exemplary embodiments, their details are not generally required for an understanding of the exemplary embodiments. As such, these details are not included so as to not obscure the description of the exemplary embodiments.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 show an illustrative QoS Control frame, and an exemplary method of transmitting frames between a QAP and a QSTA in accordance with exemplary embodiments, respectively. The QoS Control Field Frame 200 frame is formatted per the specification IEEE 802.1 IE Draft D4.0 Article 7.1.3.5 with modifications germane to the exemplary embodiments. It is noted that the entire disclosure of the referenced specification is specifically incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The QoS Control Field Frame 200 includes various elements such as the traffic identifier (TID) 201, a schedule pending element 202, an acknowledgement (ACK) policy 203, and a transmission opportunity (TXOP) limit 204. The numeric notation at the top of each frame element indicates the number of bits for the frame 200. It is noted that the minimum and maximum service intervals referenced herein are normally in a separate<br><br>
and direct link transmissions/polls. This procedure is effected in keeping with the protocol of the referenced IEEE 802.11 standard and/or its revisions. To indicate the end of the service interval, the last QoS Control Field Frame of the interval is transmitted by the QAP, and includes a last frame bit L 206.<br>
At step 307, the QSTA queries whether the last frame bit 206 has been received. If the last frame bit has been received, the QSTA send an ACK at step 308. At this point, fee QSTA sets the service period end reference point. If, on the other hand, the last frame bit 206 has not been received at step 308, the QSTA queries if the current time is beyond the maximum service duration at step 312. If not, the method repeats beginning at step 304. If the maximum service duration has passed, the QSTA recognizes that no further servicing by the QAP is due in the present service interval, and the QSTA may enter a power save mode, or manage internal queues in preparation of the next service period. This is effected at step 309. Beneficially, this allows the QSTA to have a definite stopping point. This is in contrast to the known techniques, where the QSTA may remain in an 'on' state, wasting energy, or may allow certain queues that must be serviced in a particular time period to expire because the QSTA is awaiting further transmissions in vain, or both. Finally, at step 310, the QSTA exits power save mode before the next scheduled service interval begins. The process repeats as at step 301.<br>
Before proceeding with a discussion of the transmission of the last SEF (change) of a service interval, it is useful to note that all possible scenarios of the transmission and reception of the SEF 200 have not been described in the interest of clarity. Clearly, other scenarios of transmission/reception and acknowledgement may occur, requiring reiteration (possibly in a continuous manner) of one or more of the steps of the method 300 before the required synchronicity between the QAP and the QSTA has been realized. As such, it is within the purview of the exemplary method that any required steps be repeated until the synchronized setting of the commencement of a service interval by both the QSTA and the QAP is achieved.<br>
Fig. 3b shows a method of transmitting a method of transmitting frames between the QAP and the QSTA from the perspective of the QAP. Steps 301 and 302 are the same as above. At step 311 if the current time is equal to the scheduled service period start time, the QAP sends the QoS Control Frame, including the first frame bit set 205 at step 313. Otherwise, the sequence at step 302 is repeated. At step 314, the QAP queries if the ACK<br><br>
and direct link transmissions/polls. This procedure is effected in keeping with the protocol of the referenced IEEE 802.11 standard and/or its revisions. To indicate the end of the service interval, the last QoS Control Field Frame of the interval is transmitted by the QAP, and includes a last frame bit L 206.<br>
At step 307, the QSTA queries whether the last frame bit 206 has been received. If the last frame bit has been received, the QSTA send an ACK at step 308. At this point, fee QSTA sets the service period end reference point. If, on the other hand, the last frame bit 206 has not been received at step 308, the QSTA queries if the current time is beyond the maximum service duration at step 312. If not, the method repeats beginning at step 304. If the maximum service duration has passed, the QSTA recognizes that no further servicing by the QAP is due in the present service interval, and the QSTA may enter a power save mode, or manage internal queues in preparation of the next service period. This is effected at step 309. Beneficially, this allows the QSTA to have a definite stopping point. This is in contrast to the known techniques, where the QSTA may remain in an 'on' state, wasting energy, or may allow certain queues that must be serviced in a particular time period to expire because the QSTA is awaiting further transmissions in vain, or both. Finally, at step 310, the QSTA exits power save mode before the next scheduled service interval begins. The process repeats as at step 301.<br>
Before proceeding with a discussion of the transmission of the last SEF (change) of a service interval, it is useful to note that all possible scenarios of the transmission and reception of the SEF 200 have not been described in the interest of clarity. Clearly, other scenarios of transmission/reception and acknowledgement may occur, requiring reiteration (possibly in a continuous manner) of one or more of the steps of the method 300 before the required synchronicity between the QAP and the QSTA has been realized. As such, it is within the purview of the exemplary method that any required steps be repeated until the synchronized setting of the commencement of a service interval by both the QSTA and the QAP is achieved.<br>
Fig. 3b shows a method of transmitting a method of transmitting frames between the QAP and the QSTA from the perspective of the QAP. Steps 301 and 302 are the same as above. At step 311 if the current time is equal to the scheduled service period start time, the QAP sends the QoS Control Frame, including the first frame bit set 205 at step 313. Otherwise, the sequence at step 302 is repeated. At step 314, the QAP queries if the ACK<br><br>
has been received by the QAP within a prescribed time. If so, the transmission and reception per the referenced IEEE specification continues at step 315. If the ACK has not been received, step 312 is repeated, and the first frame bit set 205 is re-sent. Regardless whether the QSTA received the first frame bit set 205 in a previous step, the QSTA sets the service period start reference per the recently received first frame bit set In other words, in order to achieve synchronicity as to the start of the service period by the QSTA and the QAP, the ACK receipt is required. Therefore, the QAP will resend first frame bit set, and the QSTA will set the service period reference point per the QoS Control Field Frame received. Of course, this sub-loop comprised of steps 313 and 314 of the exemplary method may be repeated until the ACK is received by the QAP.<br>
As is readily appreciated, the process of steps 313 and 314 results in the setting of the service period start reference uniformly at both QAP and QSTA. To wit, if the ACK has been received, both the QAP and the QSTA recognize a particular time (dictated by the QAP in the QoS Control Field Frame 200) as being the start of the service interval. This recognition provides synchronicity between the QAP and QSTA, and results directly from the transmission, reception, acknowledgement and reception of the acknowledgement of the first frame F. Stated differently, because the QAP sends a first frame element bit set 205 indicating that it is the first transmission in an interval, and the QSTA receives the first frame element bit set 205 indicating that it is the first transmission, and the QAP receives the acknowledgement that the first frame bit element 205 has been received, there can be no question that the particular is the first transmission, from which the initiation (also referred to as the reference point) of the service interval is based. But for this transmission, reception and acknowledgement of the first frame element bit set 206, failure of either the QSTA or the QAP to receive a transmission can result in the lack of required synchronicity between the QAP and QSTA. This can result in an unacceptable protocol failure such as discussed by example above.<br>
To indicate the end of the prescribed service period, at step 316 the QAP sends a QoS Control Field Frame 200 including a last frame element bit set 206. At step 317, the QAP queries whether an ACK from the QSTA has been received or not. If so, the service period ends at step 318. If not, at step 319 a query is made if the medium of transmission between the QSTA and the QAP is busy within the PIFS. If the medium is busy, the service period terminates at step 318. If the medium is not busy, the QAP queries at step<br><br>
320 if a set limit of transmissions of QoS Control Field Frames 200 including a last frame element bit set 206 have been reached. If not, a query is made at step 321 if the current service duration exceeds the maximum service duration. If so, the service period ends at step 318. If not, the sequence beginning with step 316 is repeated.<br>
The sequence of the exemplary process beginning at step 315 substantially eliminates ambiguity in the actual termination of the service interval. To wit, the sequence of sending a last bit frame 206 by the QAP indicating that the service period is to end; the receiving of the last bit frame 206 by the QSTA; the sending by the QSTA of the acknowledgement that the last bit frame has been received; and the receiving of the acknowledgement by the QAP substantially synchronizes the end of the service period as to the QAP and the QSTA. This synchronicity provides uplink and downlink benefits. The uplink benefits include the ability to early management of certain time-sensitive queues, which can be done by the QSTA because the end of the service interval is recognized, and the QSTA does not waste valuable time awaiting further transmissions. Furthermore, this allows more time to do queue management as the end of service period is recognized early. Moreover, there are downlink benefits realized because the QSTA recognizes unequivocally that the service interval has ended, and may conserve power, or manage queues, or any other desired MAC function.<br>
The exemplary embodiment being thus described, it would be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways by one of ordinary skill in the art having had the benefit of the present disclosure. Such variations are not regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims and their legal equivalents.<br><br><br>
