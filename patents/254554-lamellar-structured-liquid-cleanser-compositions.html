LAMELLAR STRUCTURED LIQUID CLEANSER COMPOSITIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention is directed to stable structured liquid cleanser compositions.  More particularly, the present invention is directed to structured liquid cleansing compositions such as a facial wash, body wash, or baby wash- Along with cleansing, the structured liquid cleanser compositions introduce onto the skin a beneficial component such as a skin barrier enhancing agent or a skin protectant.  The compositions are capable of suspending the beneficial component in the composition such that transfer to the skin of the beneficial component is improved over conventional surfactant-based cleansing products.<br>
[0002] The stratum corneum is the outer-most layer of the skin and is responsible for regulating skin water levels and functioning as a barrier against chemicals and other stressors found in the environment.  The complex arrangement of lipids in the intercellular space of the stratum corneum is responsible for the establishment of normal barrier function.  Multi-layered structures of cholesterol, ceramides, and fatty acids, as well as some other minor lipids, provides the major barrier to the transport of hydrophilic substances into or through the skin.<br>
[0003] In order to protect and care for the stratum corneum, and skin in general, most people frequently clean skin to remove dirt, contaminants, and bacteria.  Many different types of skin cleansing formulations are commercially available, including, for example, hand washes, face washes, and body washes. Along with surfactants for cleaning, many of the commercially available washes additionally include one or more skin benefit agents for application to the skin during washing.  These agents may include, for example, moisturizers, lipids, oils, and the<br><br>
like.<br>
[0004]  In many cases, in order for the skin benefit agent to be easily transferable to the skin and/or deposited thereon from the wash formulation, the skin benefit agent must be emulsified in the wash product to keep it from settling to the bottom of the product.  Although this does allow for the benefit ingredient to be suspended in the wash formulation, once emulsified, a majority of the benefit agent may simply be washed away and not contact, or be deposited on, the surface of the skin.  Additionally, even if the benefit ingredient does contact the skin, it may be washed away during the rinsing of the wash product from the skin.<br>
[0005] Based on the foregoing, it would be beneficial to provide skin wash products that include a skin benefit ingredient, such as a barrier enhancing agent, for example, that can be easily transferred to the skin from the wash product.  Additionally, it would be beneficial if the skin benefit ingredient remained on the skin after washing such that the benefit could be improved.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present invention is directed to stable structured liquid cleansing compositions comprising small droplets or particulates of skin benefit ingredients. Stability of the composition and suspension of the skin benefit ingredient is achieved by the structure and to a certain extent the viscosity produced by surfactants present in the composition, which are in a lamellar phase.  Because the skin benefit ingredient is included in the structured liquid composition in droplet form less than about 30 micrometers and is suspended rather than emulsified, the benefit ingredient is easily transferred to the skin and substantially remains on the skin after washing to achieve<br><br>
the desired benefit.<br>
[0007] Therefore, the present invention is directed to a liquid cleanser composition comprising a lamellar structured liquid.  The liquid comprises from about 30% (by weight) to about 80% (by weight) of a surfactant, from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight) of a lipid phase, and from about 19% (by weight) to about 69% (by weight) water. The lipid phase comprises from about 1% (by weight) to about 5% (by weight) of a sterol and from about 95% (by weight) to about 99% (by weight) of a natural fat or oil.  The liquid cleanser composition has a viscosity of from about 10,000 cps to about 300,000 cps.<br>
[0008] The present invention is further directed to a liquid cleanser composition comprising a lamellar structured liquid.  The liquid comprises from about 30% (by weight) to about 80% (by weight) of a surfactant, from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight) of a skin protectant, and from about 19% (by weight) to about 69% (by weight) water. The liquid cleanser composition has a viscosity of from about 10,000 cps to about 300,000 cps.<br>
[0009] The present invention is further directed to a liquid cleanser composition comprising a lamellar structured liquid.  The liquid comprises from about 30% (by weight) to about 80% (by weight) of a surfactant, from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight) of a sunscreen active, and from about 19% (by weight) to about 69% (by weight) water. The liquid cleanser composition has a viscosity of from about 10,000 cps to about 300,000 cps.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0010] The present invention is generally directed to stable structured liquid cleansing compositions that provide a skin benefit upon application and use.  The compositions<br><br>
are formulated in such a manner that the cleansing surfactants present in the composition form a lamellar phase that enables the suspension of one or more skin benefit ingredients therein.  Because the skin benefit ingredient, which may be a lipid for example, is not emulsified into the composition, the ingredient is more easily deposited on the skin during the washing process.  Additionally, because the skin benefit ingredient is formulated such that it is present in small droplets, a substantial amount of the ingredient remains on the skin after washing and rinsing to provide the intended benefit.<br>
[0011] The liquid cleanser compositions described herein may be formulated as a number of different types of washes for ultimate sale to a consumer.  For example, the compositions may comprise facial washes, body washes, hand washes, baby washes, and the like.  Additionally, the compositions may comprise shampoos or other hair and scalp-treating products.<br>
[0012] As noted above, the aqueous liquid cleanser compositions described herein comprise from about 19% (by weight) to about 69% (by weight) water.  As used herein, the term "by weight" refers to the total weight of the liquid cleanser composition, including all components thereof.  For example, if the liquid cleanser composition comprised 19% (by weight) water, and had a total weight of 100 grams, the liquid cleanser composition would comprise 19 grams of water.<br>
[0013] The liquid cleanser composition additionally comprises from about 30% (by weight) - to about 80% (by weight) of a surfactant.  The surfactant component or system is included in the liquid cleanser composition to provide a cleaning, lathering, and/or foaming action during the use of the product, along with a structured liquid system.  Although commonly referred to herein in the singular, it should be<br><br>
recognized that the liquid cleanser compositions described herein-may comprise a single surfactant, or may comprise a combination of two, three, four, or more surfactants to obtain the desired properties of the product.  As noted above, the suspension of various skin benefit ingredients, which can be oil droplets or particulates, for example, is a function of both the structure of the composition and its viscosity.<br>
[0014] The liquid cleanser compositions are formulated in such a manner that the surfactant present forms a lamellar phase in solution; that is, the surfactant forms lamellar-like sheets in the solution that form together like layers of an onion that prevent the skin benefit ingredient from rising to the surface or falling to the bottom of the composition. These lamellar structured liquids are concentrated surfactant systems that allow for the suspension therein of droplets of oils, particulates, or other components.  Because these structured systems allow for long term suspension of a desired skin benefit ingredient, emulsification of the skin benefit ingredient into the liquid is not required to keep the skin benefit ingredient from settling out.  This is advantageous as the skin benefit ingredient can then be more easily transferred to the skin during use of the product as the emulsion does not have to be broken for the skin benefit ingredient to reach the surface of the skin.<br>
[0015] The stability of the structured liquid<br>
composition and the suspension of the oil or particulate skin benefit ingredient is significantly achieved by the viscosity of the liquid composition produced by the surfactant system present in the lamellar phase.  In order to achieve the desired benefits, the liquid cleanser compositions described herein have a viscosity (as measured at 25°C and a shear rate of 1/sec) of from about 10,000 cps to about 200,000 cps,<br><br>
desirably from about 25,000 cps to about 100,000 cps, and desirably from about 50,000 cps to about 75,000 cps. Although in some embodiments it may be suitable, at a viscosity above about 200,000 cps, the composition begins to become very thick and would generally have poor consumer aesthetics.  Within these disclosed viscosity ranges, the structured liquid cleansing product is stable and can suspend the skin benefit ingredient therein such that emulsification is not required to keep the skin benefit ingredient in the solution.  As used herein, the term "stable" means that the structured liquid is able to suspend 3 0 micrometer oil droplets without substantial phase separation at room temperature for a period of at least 3 months.<br>
[0016] Suitable surfactants for use in the structured liquid cleanser compositions to achieve the desired cleaning and viscosity properties include anionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, and combinations thereof.  Suitable anionic surfactants include, for example, alkyl sulfates, alkyl ether sulfates, alkali metal or ammonia salts of alkyl sulfates, alkali metal or ammonia salts of alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl phosphates, alkyl glyceryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfosuccinates, alkyl taurates, acyl taurates, alkyl sarcosinates, acyl sarcosinates, sulfoacetates, alkyl phosphate esters, mono alkyl succinates, monoalkyl maleates, sulphoacetates, acyl isethionates, alkyl carboxylates, phosphate esters, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0017] Suitable amphoteric surfactants include, for example, betaines, alkylamido betaines, sulfobetaines, N-alkyl betaines, sultaines, amphoacetates, diamphoacetates, imidazoline carboxylates, sarcosinates, acylamphoglycinates, such as cocamphocarboxyglycinates and acylamphopropionates, and combinations thereof.<br><br>
[0018] Suitable zwitterionic surfactants include, for example, 4-[N,N-di(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-octadecylammonio]-butane-1-carboxylate, 5- [S-3-hydroxypropyl-S-hexadecylsulfonio]-3-hydroxypentane-l-sulfate, 3-[P,P-diethyl-P-3,6,9-trioxatetradexopcylphosphonio]-2-hydroxypropane-1-phosphate, 3-[N,N-dipropyl-N-3-dodecoxy-2-hydroxypropylammonio]-propane-1-phosphonate, 3-(N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonio)propane-l-sulfonate, 3-(N,N-dimethyl-N-hexadecylammonio)-2-hydroxypropane-l-sulfonate, 4-[N,N-di(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-(2-hydroxydodecyl)ammonio]-butane-1-carboxylate, 3-[S-ethyl-S-(3-dodecoxy-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl)sulfonio]-propane-1-phosphate, 3-[P,P-dimethyl-P-dodecylphosphonio]-propane-1-phosphonate, 5*[N,N-di(3-hydroxypropyl)-N~hexadecylammonio]-2-hydroxy-pentane-l-sulfate, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0019] In one embodiment of the present invention, along with the surfactant system and the water, the structured liquid cleanser composition comprises a lipid phase in an amount of from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight).  The lipid phase comprises from about 1% (by weight) to about 5% (by weight) of a sterol or sterol derivative and from about 95% (by weight) to about 99% (by weight) of a natural fat or oil.  When applied to the skin, the lipid phase of the structured liquid cleanser composition may act as a skin barrier enhancing agent; that is, one or more components of the lipid phase may penetrate through the surface of the skin and into the viable layers of the skin and replace or add various components, such as lipids, to the skin to improve skin health.  For example, lipids may penetrate into the skin and correct a defective epidermal barrier in the skin and may further fortify the barrier to prevent its disruption due to environmental insults. Further, some components may also provide a moisturization<br><br>
benefit to one or more layers of the skin, resulting in increased skin hydration and health.<br>
[0020] Suitable sterols or sterol derivatives for inclusion in the lipid phase of the liquid cleanser composition include beta sterols having a tail on the 17 position and having no polar groups, cholesterol, sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol, Ci0-C30 cholesterol/lanosterol esters, cholecalciferol, cholesteryl hydroxystearate, cholesteryl isostearate, cholesteryl stearate, 7-dehydrocholesterol, dihydrocholesterol, dihydrocholesteryl octyidecanoate, dihydrolanosterol, dihydrolanosteryl octyldecanoate, ergocalciferol, tall oil sterol, soy sterol acetate, lanasterol, soy sterol, avocado sterols, sterol esters, and mixtures thereof.<br>

[0024] Some preferred natural fats and oils include, but are not limited to Avocado Oil, Apricot Oil, Babassu Oil, Borage Oil, Camellia oil, Canola oil, Castor Oil, Coconut oil, Corn Oil, Cottonseed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil, Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Maleated Soybean Oil, Meadowfoam Oil, Palm Kernel Oil, Phospholipids, Rapeseed Oil, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Rose Hip Oil, Sunflower Oil, Soybean Oil, PROLIPID 141 (proprietary blend of Glyceryl Stearate, Fatty Acids, Lecithin, and Phospholipids from International Specialty Products, Wayne, N.J.) and the like, as well as mixtures thereof.<br><br>
[0025] In another embodiment of the present invention, the lipid phase described above additionally comprises from about 0.5% (by weight) to about 2% (by weight) of a ceramide or ceramide derivative.  Because ceramides comprise about 40% of epidermal lipids, they are a major skin component that are important because of their large weight contribution and structural characteristics.  Ceramides provide a moisturization benefit to the skin by increasing water retention therein and are necessary for normal skin cell desquamation.  Although many ceramides or ceramide derivatives are suitable for inclusion in the lipid phase described above, some preferred ceramides or ceramide derivatives include glucosylceramides, acylceramide, bovine ceramides, sphingolipid E, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0026] To ensure that one or more components of the lipid phase remains on the skin after washing with the liquid cleanser composition described herein and rinsing, in one embodiment the lipid phase comprises suspended small droplets of the components.  These small droplets are generally more likely to remain on the skin after washing as compared to larger droplets that are easily rinsed off during washing. Generally, it is preferred that the droplets forming the lipid phase of the liquid cleanser composition have a size less than about 30 micrometers, desirably less than about 20 micrometers, and still more desirably less than about 10 micrometers.  At these sizes, the droplets are substantially likely to remain on the skin after the washing is complete and can impart the desired benefit.<br>
[0027] In order to ensure that the droplets that comprise the lipid phase of the liquid cleanser composition have a suitable size for application to the skin, in some embodiments it may be beneficial to introduce into the lipid phase of the structured liquid composition from about 0.1%<br><br>
(by weight of the lipid phase) to about 4% (by weight of the lipid phase) of a surfactant or a combination of surfactants having an HLB of from about 4 to about 8.  Suitable surfactants include sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan stearate, sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan beeswax, polyoxyetheylene 2 cetyl ether, polyoxyethylene 2 stearyl ether, polyoxyethylene 2 oleyl ether, and the like.  The surfactant helps reduce the droplet size of the lipid phase by reducing interfacial tension between the oil droplet and the water.  A small amount of a surfactant with an HLB of from about 4 to about 8 is preferred to prevent the emulsification of the lipid phase into the water contained in the formulation.  These surfactants having an HLB of from about 4 to about 8 do not substantially affect the lamellar structured composition as the surfactants having an HLB of from about 4 to about 8 are mixed with the oil or particulate and surround the oil or particulate.<br>
[0028] In addition to the water, surfactant, and lipid phase, the liquid cleanser composition may also optionally comprise one or more optional ingredients to impart additional benefits to the composition.  Some optional ingredients may include, for example, antimicrobial actives, antifungal actives, antiseptic actives, antioxidants, astringents, anti-dandruff actives, biological actives, colorants, deodorants, emollients, film formers, fragrances, lubricants, humectants, natural moisturizing agents, preservatives, skin conditioning agents, skin exfoliating agents, skin protectants, solvents, solubilizing agents, suspending agents, wetting agents, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0029] In another embodiment of the present invention, a skin protectant can be combined with the water and surfactant components described above to produce a structured liquid cleanser composition comprising a suspended skin<br><br>
protectant.  Skin protectants are beneficial skin compounds that gather on the skin's surface to provide a physical barrier on the surface to keep penetrants from penetrating through the skin's surface and into the skin.  Additionally, some skin protectants may reduce the loss of moisture from the skin resulting in increased skin hydration.  Generally, the skin protectant will be present in the liquid cleanser composition in an amount of from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight).<br>
[0030] Suitable skin protectants for inclusion in the liquid cleanser compositions include, for example, polydimethylsiloxanes such as dimethicone, dimethicone gum, cyclomethicones, and combinations thereof, organo-functional polydimethylsiloxanes including alkyl, amine, and polyether-functional polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone gums, silicone elastomers, silicone resins, silicone polyamides, petrolatum, lanolin, acrylates/dimethicone methacrylate copolymers, allantoin, calamine, cod liver oil, escin, oil soluble botanical extracts, kaolin, laponite, zinc oxide, mineral oil, shark liver oil, talc, zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0031] Similar to the lipid phase described above, to ensure that the skin protectant component of the liquid cleanser composition remain on the skin after washing, in one embodiment the skin protectant is comprised of small droplets and/or particulates.  These small droplets and/or particulates are generally more likely to remain on the skin after washing as compared to larger droplets that are easily rinsed off during washing.  Generally, it is preferred that the droplets and/or particulates of skin protectant component of the liquid cleanser composition have a size less than about 3 0 micrometers, desirably less than about 20 micrometers, and still more desirably less than about 10<br><br>
micrometers.  At these sizes, the droplets and/or particulates are substantially likely to remain on the skin after the washing is complete and can impart the desired benefit.  The size of these droplets may also be controlled by adding a low HLB surfactant as described above.<br>
[0032] In addition to the water, surfactant, and skin protectant, the liquid cleanser composition may also optionally comprise one or more optional ingredients to impart additional benefits to the composition.  Some optional ingredients may include, for example, antimicrobial actives, antifungal actives, antiseptic actives, antioxidants, astringents, anti-dandruff agents, biological actives, colorants, deodorants, emollients, film formers, fragrances, lubricants, humectants, preservatives, natural moisturizing agents, skin conditioning agents, skin exfoliating agents, skin protectants, solvents, solubilizing agents, suspending agents, wetting agents, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0033] In another embodiment of the present invention, a sunscreen active can be combined with the water and surfactant components described above to produce a structured liquid cleanser composition comprising a suspended sunscreen active.  Sunscreen actives are beneficial when applied to the skin as they reduce the likelihood of sunburn and the corresponding damage to the skin.  Generally, the sunscreen active will be present in the liquid cleanser composition in an amount of from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight).<br>
[0034] Suitable sunscreen actives include benzophenone-8, butyl methoxydibenzoymethane, cinoxate, DEA-methoxycinnamate, digalloyl trioleate, 1- (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-l,3-pentanediene, ethyl dihydroxypropyl PABA, ethylhexyl dimethyl PABA, ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, ethylhexyl salicylate, 4-(2-Beta-<br><br>

[0035] In addition to the water, surfactant, and sunscreen active, the liquid cleanser composition may also optionally comprise one or more optional ingredients to impart additional benefits to the composition.  Some optional ingredients may include, for example, humectants, preservatives, antimicrobial actives, antifungal actives, antiseptic actives, antioxidants, astringents, biological actives, colorants, deodorants, emollients, film formers, fragrances, lubricants, natural moisturizing agents, skin conditioning agents, skin exfoliating agents, skin protectants, solvents, solubilizing agents, suspending agents, wetting agents, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0036] Similar to the lipid phase and skin protectants described above, to ensure that the sunscreen active component of the liquid cleanser composition remains on the skin after washing, in one embodiment the sunscreen active is comprised of small droplets and/or particulates.  These small droplets and/or particulates are generally more likely to remain on the skin after washing as compared to larger droplets that are easily rinsed off during washing.<br><br>
Generally, it is preferred that the droplets of sunscreen active component of the liquid cleanser composition have a size less than about 3 0 micrometers, desirably less than about 20 micrometers, and still more desirably less than about 10 micrometers-  At these sizes, the droplets are substantially likely to remain on the skin after the washing is complete and can impart the desired benefit.  The size of these droplets may be controlled by adding a low HLB surfactant as described above.<br>
[0037] In another embodiment of the present invention, a lipid, skin protectant, or sunscreen active can be microencapsulated and combined with water and the surfactant components described herein to produce a structured liquid cleanser composition comprising a suspended microencapsulated or polymeric entrapped material containing the lipid, skin protectant, and/or sunscreen active.  Generally, the microencapsulated or polymeric entrapped particle comprising the lipid, skin protectant, and/or sunscreen active will be present in the liquid cleanser composition in an amount of from about 1% (by weight) to about 30% (by weight).<br>
[0038] Similar to the other embodiments described herein, to ensure that the microencapsulated material or polymeric entrapped material of the liquid cleanser composition remains on the skin after washing, the microencapsulated or polymeric entrapped material comprises small particulates.  These small particulates are generally more likely to remain on the skin after washing as compared to larger droplets or particulates that are easily rinsed off during washing.  Generally, it is preferred that the particulates have a size less than about 3 0 micrometers, desirably less than about 20 micrometers, and still more desirably less than about 15 micrometers.  At these sizes, the particulates are substantially likely to remain on the<br><br>
skin after washing is complete and can impart the desired benefit.  As noted above, the size of the particulates or droplets may be controlled by adding a surfactant having an HLB of from about 4 to about 8.<br>
