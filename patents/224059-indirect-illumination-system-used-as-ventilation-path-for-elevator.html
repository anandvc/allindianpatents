				<td>This invention relates to Indirect Illumination System    As Ventilation Path For<br>
Elevator<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an indirect illumination system used as a ventilation<br>
path for an elevator, and more particularly to an indirect illumination system for<br>
guiding wind from the top of an elevator cage and at the same time for preventing a<br>
light from an illuminator on the ceiling of the elevator from being directly illuminated<br>
toward passengers in the elevator cage.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Generally, a system for illuminating the inside of an elevator cage adopts a direct<br>
illumination system, an indirect illumination system, and/or a combined system thereof.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig. 1 depicts an example of prior indirect illumination system.<br>
In Fig. 1, illuminators 1 such as fluorescent lamps, electric bulbs and the like are<br>
mounted on the ceiling of the elevator cage, and a semitransparent shielding plate 3 is<br>
disposed under the illuminator. Since blowers 10 are respectively positioned over the<br>
upper corners of the elevator cage and the ventilation paths 20 are respectively placed<br>
under the blowers 10 in the existing most of elevators, as shown in the figure, the wind<br>
flowed from the respective blower is bypassed the illuminators, thereby entering into<br>
the inside of the elevator cage.<br>
Such an indirect illumination system has some advantages in that ventilation is smooth<br>
and passenger's dazzling due to light emitted from the illuminators 1 is prevented by<br>
the shielding plate 3 is prevented. Nevertheless, it is necessary to remove and clean the<br>
shielding plate 3 periodically because the shielding plate becomes easily dirty due to<br>
dust accumulated on it. In addition, the shielding plate should be removed whenever<br>
exchanging the illuminators 1. Further, by the shielding plate 3 mounted right under the<br>
 ceiling of the elevator cage, the height between the ceiling and the floor of the elevator cage becomes lower so that the cargo 5 such as a wardrobe, tall furniture and the like can not be inserted into the elevator cage, thereby causing in- convenience in carrying such cargo 5. <br>
[5] Fig. 2 shows another embodiment of indirect illumination system. In the system of Fig. 2, the illuminatorsl are mounted above an opaque shielding plate 3, and light emitted from the illuminators is not directed toward a user and is reflected on the ceiling or the sidewalls of the elevator cage in arrows B and C. In this system, there are no such problems as the light dazzles the user, the intensity of illumination is too high, and the ceiling height is too low and so forth. However, there are such problems as the shielding plate 3 blocks a portion of ventilation outlet 20 to lower the effect of ventilation, and the illumination effect is substantially decreased due to the il- lumination by only the light reflected on the ceiling and the sidewalls. Similarly to the example of Fig. 1, the problem which the dust lay on the shielding plate 3 can not also be solved. <br>
[6] Fig. 3 is a view showing an example of a direct illumination system. As shown in the figure, the illuminators 1 are mounted under the ceiling of the elevator cage without shielding plate. In this system, dazzling effect is occurred since the light emitted the illuminator is directly directed to a user. Further, the ceiling height of the elevator cage is too low. In addition, the internal temperature of the elevator cage sub- stantially increases because of the electric lamp used. <br>
Disclosure of Invention Technical Problem [7] The present invention is designed to solve the aforementioned problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an illumination system for elevator which increases the ceiling height of the elevator cage as high as possible to maximize the spatial capability of the internal space of the elevator cage, prevents the light emitted from the illumination lamp from being directly illuminated toward passengers to previously prevent dazzling phenomenon, and prevents the dust from being ac- cumulated on the shielding plate. <br>
Technical Solution [8] According to the present invention br achieving the object, there is provided an indirect illumination system as a ventilation path for an elevator cage using light emitted from an illuminator such as a fluorescent lamp, an electric lamp, or the like, comprising : [9] illumination shielding devices mounted under ventilation outlets for guiding the wind flowed from blowers disposed over the ceiling of an elevator cage toward the internal space of the elevator cage, the illumination shielding device having a plurality of inclined long rectangular plates arranged in parallel with certain spaces between each other and having lower portions inclined toward the sidewalls of the elevator cage; and [10] illuminators disposed between said illumination shielding device and the ceiling of the elevator cage to be screened by the illumination shielding device; wherein the wind flowed from the ventilation outlets sequentially passes through the illuminators and the illumination shielding devices and then is blown toward the internal space of the elevator cage, and the light emitted from the said illuminators is illuminated toward the sidewalls of the elevator cage through the inclined plates of the illumination shielding devices, thereby preventing dust or the like from being ac- cumulated on the illumination shielding devices due to the wind as well as preventing the light from being directly illuminated toward passengers in the elevator cage. <br>
[12] In accordance with the present invention, it is preferable that said illuminators and said illumination shielding devices are disposed at least one corner of ceiling of the elevator cage except the central portion of the ceiling. <br>
[13] In addition, in the present invention, it is more preferable that the indirect il- lumination system further comprises a reflective plate 50 having good reflexibility mounted on the ceiling of the elevator cage. <br>
Advantageous Effects [14] According to the illumination system for elevator constructed as above, the ceiling height of the elevator cage is sufficiently high to maximize the spatial capability of the elevator cage since the shielding plate is disposed only at the upper corners of the ceiling of the elevator cage except the central portion of ceiling. Further, according to the present invention, the reflective effect using the ceiling and sidewalls of the cage is maintained while the light emitted from the illumination lamp is prevented from being directly illuminated toward passengers, thereby maintaining the necessary intensity of illumination as well as previously preventing a dazzling phenomenon. In addition, according to the present invention, the dust accumulation on the shielding plate can be prevented by the wind from the ventilation outlet passing through the shielding plate. <br>
Further, one side of the shielding plate is open to easily exchange the illumination lamps without removing the shielding plate. <br>
Description of Drawings [15] The above and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by describing in detail preferred em- bodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: [16] Fig. 1 is a side view showing an example of a prior indirect illumination system for an elevator cage; [17] Fig. 2 is a side view showing another prior indirect illumination system br an elevator cage ; [18] Fig. 3 is a side view showing an example of a prior direct illumination system for an elevator cage; [19] Fig. 4 is a side view showing an indirect illumination system according to the present invention; [20] Fig. 5 is a perspective view of an indirect illumination system according to the present invention; [21] Fig. 6 is a partial side view showing in detail an indirect illumination system according to the present invention; and [22] Fig. 7 is a side view showing another example according to the present invention. <br>
Best Mode [23] Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. <br>
[24] Fig. 4 is a side cross-sectional view of an elevator cage in which the illumination system according to present invention is mounted. <br>
[25] As shown in Fig. 4, blowers 10 are respectively mounted over the respective corner portion of the ceiling of the elevator cage. In the shown example, the blowers 10 are disposed over the left and right upper corners of the elevator cage. The ventilation outlets 20 for guiding the wind from the blowers 10 into the inside of the elevator cage are respectively ibrmed under the blower 10. Illumination shielding devices 30 according to the present invention are respectively disposed under the ventilation outlets 20, and illuminators 40 are disposed above respective illumination-shielding device 30. <br>
[26] The illumination-shielding device 30 comprises a plurality of inclined long rectangular plates 32 each arranged parallel with a certain distance between the plates 32. Respective plate 32 is inclined toward the sidewall of the elevator cage, which is shown in detain in Figs. 5 and 6. Accordingly, the wind flowed from the ventilation outlets 20 flows through space between the inclined plates 32 into the internal space of the elevator cage along an arrow A denoted by broken line. In adition, the light emitted from the illuminator 40 is reflected on the ceiling of the elevator cage along an arrow B direction, as well as through the inclined plates 32 on the sidewall of the elevator cage along an arrow C direction. If the inclined plates 32 are inclined in the opposite direction, i. e. the lower portions of the inclined plates is inclined away the sidewall of the elevator cage, the light emitted from the illuminator directs toward eyes of a passenger, thereby occurring a dazzling phenomenon to the passenger. <br>
[27] The illuminator 40 is arranged between the illumination-shielding device 30 and the ceiling of the elevator cage, and is screened by the illumination-shielding device from the view field of the user. <br>
Mode for Invention [28] Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing in detail the illuminator 40 and the shielding device 30, in which both the shielding device 30 and the illuminator 40 are mounted on the sidewall of the elevator cage. In adition, the illuminator 40 comprise any one of the fluorescent lamp, an electric lamp and a rod shaped bulb and the like as necessary. <br>
[29] Fig. 6 is a side view showing in detail an illumination system according to the present invention. As shown in Fig. 6, the wind flowed from the ventilation outlets 20 passes through the spaces between the inclined plates 32 of the shielding devices 30 along an arrow A and then is circulated in the internal space of the elevator cage. In addition, the light emitted from the illuminator 40 is reflected on the ceiling and sidewalls of the elevator cage along arrows B and C. <br>
[30] The wind flowed from the ventilation outlet 20 is entered into the internal space of the elevator cage by sequentially passing through the illuminator 40 and the il- lumination shielding device 30, and the light emitted from the said illuminator 40 is directed toward the sidewalls of the elevator cage through the spaces between the inclined plate 32 of the illumination shielding device 30, thereby preventing the dust and the like from being accumulated on the illumination shielding device 30 due to the ventilated wind as well as preventing the light from being directly illuminated toward passengers in the elevator cage. <br>
[31] In addition, as shown in Fig. 4, in the illumination system according to the present invention, the illuminators 40 and the illumination shielding devices 30 are mounted on at least one corner of the ceiling of the elevator cage except the center portion of the ceiling. Accordingly, the central ceiling height the elevator cage becomes higher compared with conventional elevator cages, thereby maximizing the spatial capability of the elevator cage. <br>
[32] Fig. 7 is a side view of another embodiment of the elevator indirect illumination system according to the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment of Fig. 4 described above except that a reflective plate 50 having high re- flexibility is additionally mounted under the ceiling and respective finishing member 34 is fixed to the respective internal end of the shielding device 30. Such a reflective plate 50 completely covers the ceiling of the elevator cage or covers only a central portion of the ceiling as necessary. It is preferable that the reflective plate 50 is mounted to the ceiling of the elevator cage as closely as possible in order to improve the partial capability of the elevator cage. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the light emitted from the illuminator 40 is reflected on the reflective plate 50 along an allow B to improve optical efficiency and the L-shaped finishing member 34 is fixed to respective internal end of the shielding device 30 to improve the appearance of the shielding device 30 compared to the embodiment of Fig. 4. This conforms to a recent trend in a elevator cage which places high importance to interior decoration. Therefore, in accordance with the present invention, the internal illumination intensity of the elevator cage is improved and beauty of decoration becomes more excellent. <br><br><br><br><br>
