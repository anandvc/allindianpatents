				<td>Cosmetic Compositions Containing Esters Based on 2-<br>
Propylheptanol<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the use of esters of 2-propylheptanol in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations, to specific esters and to a process for their production.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Cosmetic hair and skin-care emulsions are expected by the consumer to satisfy a number of requirements. Apart from the cleansing and caring effects which determine the particular application, importance is attributed to such diverse parameters as highest possible dermatological compatibility, good lipid-layer-enhancing properties, elegant appearance, optimal sensory impression and shelf life.<br>
Besides a number of surfactants, cosmetic hair- and skin-care preparations generally contain, above all, oil components and water. The oil components (emollients) used include, for example, hydrocarbons, ester oils and vegetable and animal oils/fats/waxes. In order to satisfy stringent market requirements in regard to sensory properties and optimal dermatological compatibility, new oil components and emulsifier mixtures are being continuously developed and tested. The use of ester oils in cosmetic products has been known for some time. Because of their importance, new processes for their production are also being continuously developed. Branched ester oils in particular impart a "lighter" skin feel and are therefore the subject of intensive research. The use of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol monoesters is described, for example, in DE 101 60 681; the use of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol diesters is described in DE 101 60 682.<br>
The problem addressed by the^present invention was to provide new<br>
ester oils preferably liquid at 20°C for cosmetic applications which would have an improved profile in regard to their sensory properties (lightness, non-greasy skin feel, softness, spreadability, absorption, distribution behavior, oiliness) and which could be incorporated in a number of cosmetic formulations. The hydrolysis stability of the esters and their capacity for formulation at low pH values would also be of interest in this regard. In addition, the esters would lend themselves to incorporation both in w/o and in o/w formulations and would be compatible in particular with crystalline UV filters, pigments, antiperspirants, salts and silicones. It has surprisingly been found that esters of 2-propylheptanol lead to sensorially light products. Some of these esters and their production are known from DE 103 05 562, but for a totally different application, namely as polymer additives.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use of esters of 2-propylheptanol with linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C4-C36 carboxylic acids or C4-C36 dicarboxylic acids in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Surprisingly, esters propyl-branched in the alkyl chain are particularly suitable for cosmetic formulations, more particularly for formulations expected to impart a "light" skin feel. The esters can be incorporated particularly well in various formulations. Liquid substance mixtures are obtained and may be used accordingly as oil components or consistency factors according to chain length, branching and number of double bonds. According to the invention, a single 2-propylheptyl-C4-C36-carboxylic acid ester or 2-propylheptyl-C4-C36-dicarboxylic acid ester or a mixture thereof may be used.<br>
The present invention relates in particular to the use of esters of 2-propylheptanol with linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C4-C36<br>
carboxylic acids or C4-C36 dicarboxylic acids in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations for wetting or impregnating or coating utility and/or hygiene wipes used for cleaning and/or care of the body.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is characterized by the use of esters containing a total of 24 or fewer carbon atoms, preferably 22 or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention is the use of esters of 2-propylheptanol with carboxylic acids selected from C4 to C30, more particularly C6 to C24, more particularly C6 to C22, more particularly to C6 to C18, more particularly C8 to C18, preferably C8 to C16, preferably C8 to C12, more particularly C6 to C10 carboxylic acids or the corresponding dicarboxylic acids.<br>

According to the invention, the use of esters of 2-propylheptanol with linear, unbranched dicarboxylic acids is preferred.<br>
The term "CX carboxylic acids" encompasses carboxylic acids with a total carbon number of X, i.e. for example "C8 carboxylic acids"<br>
encompasses all carboxylic acids which have a total carbon number of 8, such as for example n-octanoic acid, iso-octanoic acids or methylheptanoic acids. Correspondingly, the term "CX dicarboxylic acids" encompasses all acids containing 2 carboxy groups which have a total carbon number of X, so that, for example, "C4 dicarboxylic acid" encompasses inter alia butanedioic acid (succinic acid) and also maleic acid and fumaric acid.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the term "carboxylic acid" applies to "monocarboxylic acids".<br>
The sensory testing of 2-propylheptyl caprylate and 2-propylheptyl caproate shows a significant improvement in sensory properties, particularly in regard to spreading, over known emollients (for example various other ester oils or dialkyl carbonates).<br>

Also suitable are esters of 2-propylheptanol with Cekanoic® C8 (iso-octanoic acid), Cekanoic® C9 (isononanoic acid: 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic acid and 2,5,5-trimethylhexanoic acid) and Cekanoic® C10 (isodecanoic acid) from Exxon Mobile which are carboxylic acid isomer mixtures.<br>
The expression "esters of 2-propylheptanol with dicarboxylic acids" encompasses both diesters of dicarboxylic acids with 2-propylheptanol, i.e. for example di-2-propylheptyl-n-octanedioic acid diester, and monoesters, such as 2-propylheptyl-n-octanedioic acid monoester for example, and mixed esters in which one acid group of the dicarboxylic acid is esterified with 2-propylheptanol and the second acid group of the dicarboxylic acid is esterified with another alcohol.

methyl glucose and polyols, preferably glycerol or polyglycerol.<br>
The addition products of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide onto fatty alcohols, fatty acids, alkylphenols, glycerol monoesters and diesters and sorbitan monoesters and diesters of fatty acids or onto castor oil are known commercially available products. They are homolog mixtures of which the average degree of alkoxylation corresponds to the ratio between the quantities of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide and substrate with which the addition reaction is carried out. These emulsifiers are w/o or o/w emulsifiers, depending on the degree of ethoxylation. C-ia/ia fatty acid monoesters and diesters of addition products of ethylene oxide onto glycerol are known as lipid layer enhancers for cosmetic preparations.<br>
According to the invention, particularly suitable and mild emulsifiers are the polyol poly-12-hydroxystearates and mixtures thereof marketed by Cognis Deutschland GmbH under the name of "Dehymuls® PGPH" (w/o<br>
emulsifier) or "Eumulgin® VL 75" (mixture with Coco Glucosides in a ratio by weight of 1:1, o/w emulsifier) or "Dehymuls® SBL" (w/o emulsifier). Particular reference is made in this connection to EP 0 766 661 B1. The polyol component of these emulsifiers may be derived from substances which contain at least two, preferably 3 to 12 and more particularly 3 to 8 hydroxyl groups and 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
In principle, suitable lipophilic w/o emulsifiers are emulsifiers with an HLB value of 1 to 8 which are listed in numerous Tables and are well-known to the expert., Some of these emulsifiers are listed, for example, in Kirk-Othmer, "Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 3rd Edition, 1979, Vol. 8, page 913. The HLB value for ethoxylated products may also be calculated to the following formula: HLB = (100-L) : 5, where L is the percentage by weight of lipophilic groups, i.e. fatty alkyl or fatty acyl groups, in percent by weight in the ethylene oxide adducts.<br>
Of particular advantage from the group of w/o emulsifiers are partial esters of polyols, more particularly C4_6 polyols, such as for example partial esters of pentaerythritol or sugar esters, for example sucrose distearate, sorbitan monoisostearate, sorbitan sesquiisostearate, sorbitan diiso-stearate, sorbitan triisostearate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan sesqui-oleate, sorbitan dioleate, sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan monoerucate, sorbitan sesquierucate, sorbitan dierucate, sorbitan trierucate, sorbitan monoricinoleate, sorbitan sesquiricinoleate, sorbitan diricinoleate, sorbitan triricinoleate, sorbitan monohydroxystearate, sorbitan sesquihydroxy-stearate, sorbitan dihydroxystearate, sorbitan trihydroxystearate, sorbitan monotartrate, sorbitan sesquitartrate, sorbitan ditartrate, sorbitan tritartrate, sorbitan monocitrate, sorbitan sesquicitrate, sorbitan dicitrate, sorbitan tricitrate, sorbitan monomaleate, sorbitan sesquimaleate, sorbitan dimaleate, sorbitan trimaleate and technical mixtures thereof. Addition products of 1 to 30 and preferably 5 to 10 mol ethylene oxide onto the sorbitan esters mentioned are also suitable emulsifiers.<br>
Depending on the formulation, it can also be of advantage additionally to use at least one emulsifier from the group of nonionic o/w emulsifiers (HLB value: 8-18) and/or solubilizers. Examples of such emulsifiers are the ethylene oxide adducts mentioned at the beginning with a correspondingly high degree of ethoxylation, for example 10-20 ethylene oxide units for o/w emulsifiers and 20-40 ethylene oxide units for so-called solubilizers. Particularly advantageous o/w emulsifiers for the purposes of the invention are Ceteareth-12 and PEG-20 Stearate. Particularly suitable solubilizers are Eumulgin® HRE 40 (INCI name: PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor oil), Eumulgin® HRE 60 (INCI name: PEG-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil), Eumulgin® L (INCI name: PPG-1-PEG-9 Laurylglycolether) and Eumulgin® SML20 (INCI name: Polysorbat-20).<br>
Nonionic emulsifiers from the group of alkyl oligoglycosides are particularly compatible with the skin. C8-22 alkyl mono- and oligoglycosides, their production and their use are known from the prior art. They are produced in particular by reacting glucose or oligosaccharides with primary alcohols containing 8 to 22 carbon atoms. So far as the glycoside component is concerned, both monoglycosides where a cyclic sugar unit is attached to the fatty alcohol by a glycoside bond and oligomeric glycosides with a degree of oligomerization of preferably up to about 8 are suitable. The degree of oligomerization is a statistical mean value on which a homolog distribution typical of such technical products is based. Products available under the name of Plantacare® contain a CB-IB alkyl group attached by a glucosidic bond to an oligoglucoside unit with an average degree of oligomerization of 1 to 2. The acyl glucamides derived from glucamine are also suitable nonionic emulsifiers. The product marketed under the name of Emulgade® PL 68/50 by Cognis Deutschland GmbH, which is a 1:1 mixture of alkyl polyglucosides and fatty alcohols, is preferred for the purposes of the invention. According to the invention, the mixture of Lauryl Glucoside, Polyglyceryl-2-Dipolyhydroxystearate, glycerol<br>
and water which is marketed as Eumulgin® VL 75 may also be used with advantage in accordance with the invention.<br>
Other suitable emulsifiers are such substances as lecithins and phospholipids. Examples of natural lecithins are the kephalins which are also known as phosphatidic acids and which are derivatives of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoric acids. By contrast, phospholipids are generally understood to be mono- and preferably diesters of phosphoric acid with glycerol (glycerophosphates) which are generally classed as fats. Sphingosines and sphingolipids are also suitable as fat-like substances.<br>
Surfactants b-2)<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the preparations according to the invention contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) may be selected from anionic, nonionic, cationic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants. Surfactant-containing cosmetic preparations, such as for example shower gels, foam baths, shampoos, etc., preferably contain at least one anionic surfactant.<br>
The compositions according to the invention contain the surfactant(s) in a quantity of 0 to 40% by weight, preferably 0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 15% by weight and more particularly 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Typical examples of nonionic surfactants are fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, fatty acid polyglycol esters, fatty acid amide polyglycol ethers, fatty amine polyglycol ethers, alkoxylated triglycerides, mixed ethers and mixed formals, optionally partly oxidized alk(en)yl oligoglycosides or glucuronic acid derivatives, fatty acid-N-alkyl glucamides, protein hydrolyzates (particularly wheat-based vegetable products), polyol fatty acid esters, sugar esters, sorbitan esters, polysorbates and amine oxides. If the nonionic surfactants contain polyglycol ether chains, they may have a conventional homolog distribution,<br>
although they preferably have a narrow-range homolog distribution.<br>
Zwitterionic surfactants are surface-active compounds which contain at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one -COO(-) or -SCV(-) group in the molecule. Particularly suitable zwitterionic surfactants are the so-called betaines, such as the N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium glycinates, for example cocoalkyl dimethyl ammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium glycinates, for example cocoacylaminopropyl dimethyl ammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethyl imidazolines containing 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or acyl group and cocoacylaminoethyl hydroxyethyl carboxymethyl glycinate. The fatty acid amide derivative known under the CTFA name of Cocamidopropyl Betaine is particularly preferred.<br>
Ampholytic surfactants are also suitable, particularly as co-surfactants. Ampholytic surfactants are surface-active compounds which, in addition to a CB-IB alkyl or acyl group, contain at least one free amino group and at least one -COOH- or -SOaH- group in the molecule and which are capable of forming inner salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants are N-alkyl glycines, N-alkyl propionic acids, N-alkylamino-butyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkyl-amidopropyl glycines, N-alkyl taurines, N-alkyl sarcosines, 2-alkyl-aminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids containing around 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Particularly preferred ampholytic surfactants are N-cocoalkylaminopropionate, cocoacylaminoethyl aminopropionate and Ci2/ia acyl sarcosine.<br>
Anionic surfactants are characterized by a water-solubilizing anionic group such as, for example, a carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate group and a lipophilic group. Dermatologically safe anionic surfactants are known to the expert in large numbers from relevant textbooks and are commercially available. They are, in particular, alkyl sulfates in the form of their alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolammonium<br>
salts, alkylether sulfates, alkylether carboxylates, acyl isethionates, acyl sarcosinates, acyl taurines containing linear C12-18alkyl or acyl groups and sulfosuccinates and acyl glutamates in the form of their alkali metal or ammonium salts.<br>
Particularly suitable cationic surfactants are quaternary ammonium compounds, preferably ammonium halides, more especially chlorides and bromides, such as alkyl trimethyl ammonium chlorides, dialkyl dimethyl ammonium chlorides and trialkyl methyl ammonium chlorides, for example cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, stearyl trimethyl ammonium chloride, distearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, lauryl dimethyl ammonium chloride, lauryl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride and tricetyl methyl ammonium chloride. In addition, the readily biodegradable quaternary ester compounds, such as for example the dialkyl ammonium methosulfates and methyl hydroxyalkyl dialkoyloxyalkyl ammonium methosulfates marketed under the name of Stepantex® and the corresponding products of the Dehyquart® series, may be used as cationic surfactants. "Esterquats" are generally understood to be quaternized fatty acid triethanolamine ester salts. They can provide the compositions with particular softness. They are known substances which are prepared by the relevant methods of organic chemistry. Other cationic surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the invention are the quaternized protein hydrolyzates.<br>
Wax component b-3)<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the preparations according to the invention contain at least one wax component. The compositions according to the invention contain the wax component(s) in a quantity of 0 to 40% by weight, more particularly 0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 15% by weight and more particularly 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
Waxes   are   normally   understood   to   be   natural   or   synthetic<br>
substances and mixtures having the following properties: they have a solid to brittle hard consistency, are coarsely to finely crystalline, transparent to opaque and melt above 30°C without decomposing. Even slightly above their melting point, they are low in viscosity and non-stringing and are very temperature-dependent in their consistency and solubility. A single wax component or a mixture of wax components melting at or above 30°C may be used in accordance with the invention.<br>
According to the invention, fats and fat-like substances with a wax-like consistency may also be used as waxes providing they have the required melting point. These include inter alia fats (triglycerides), mono-and diglycerides, natural and synthetic waxes, fat and wax alcohols, fatty acids, esters of fatty alcohols and fatty acids and fatty acid amides or mixtures of these substances.<br>
Fats in the context of the invention are understood to be triacylglycerols, i.e. the triple esters of fatty acids with glycerol. The triacylglycerols preferably contain saturated, unbranched and unsubstituted fatty acid components. They may also be mixed esters, i.e. triple esters of glycerol with various fatty acids. So-called hardened fats and oils obtained by partial hydrogenation may be used in accordance with the invention and are particularly suitable as consistency factors. Vegetable hardened fats and oils, for example hardened castor oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, colza oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, almond oil, corn oil, olive oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter and coconut fat, are preferred.<br>
Suitable fats are inter alia the triple esters of glycerol with Ci2-6o fatty acids and in particular C12-36 fatty acids. These include hydrogenated castor oil, a triple ester of glycerol and a hydroxystearic acid which is marketed, for example, under the name of Cutina® HR. Glycerol tristearate, glycerol tribehenate (for example Syncrowax® HRC), glycerol tripalmitate or the triglyceride mixtures known under the name of<br>
Syncrowax® HGLC are also suitable providing the melting point of the wax component or the mixture is 30°C or higher.<br>
According to the invention, suitable wax components are, in particular, mono- and diglycerides and mixtures of these partial glycerides. Glyceride mixtures suitable for use in accordance with the invention include the products Novata® AB and Novata® B (mixture of C12-18 mono-, di- and triglycerides) and Cutina® MD or Cutina® GMS (glyceryl stearate) marketed by Cognis Deutschland GmbH.<br>
The fatty alcohols suitable for use as a wax component in accordance with the invention include C12-50 fatty alcohols. The fatty alcohols may be obtained from natural fats, oils and waxes such as, for example, myristyl alcohol, 1-pentadecanol, cetyl alcohol, 1-heptadecanol, stearyl alcohol, 1-nonadecanol, arachidyl alcohol, 1-heneicosanol, behenyl alcohol, brassidyl alcohol, lignoceryl alcohol, ceryl alcohol or myricyl alcohol. According to the invention, saturated unbranched fatty alcohols are preferred. However, unsaturated, branched or unbranched fatty alcohols may also be used as the wax component in accordance with the invention providing they have the required melting point. Other suitable fatty alcohols are the fatty alcohol cuts obtained in the reduction of naturally occurring fats and oils such as, for example, bovine tallow, peanut oil, colza oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, castor oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter and coconut oil. Howeyer, synthetic alcohols, far example the linear, even-numbered fatty alcohols from Ziegler's synthesis (Alfols) or the partly branched alcohols from the oxosynthesis (Dobanols) may also be used. C14-22 fatty alcohols marketed for example by Cognis Deutschland GmbH under the name of Lanette® 16 (C16 alcohol), Lanette® 14 (C14 alcohol), Lanette® O (C16/18<br>
alcohol) and Lanette® 22 (C18/22 alcohol) are particularly suitable for the purposes of the invention. Fatty alcohols give the compositions a dryer feeling on the skin than triglycerides.<br>
C14-40 fatty acids or mixtures thereof may also be used as wax components. These include, for example, myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitic, margaric, stearic, nonadecanoic, arachic, behenic, lignoceric, cerotic, melissic, erucic and elaeostearic acid and substituted fatty acids such as, for example, 12-hydroxystearic acid, and the amides or monoethanolamides of the fatty acids. This list is meant to be purely exemplary without any limiting character.<br>
Waxes suitable for use in accordance with the invention are, for example, natural vegetable waxes, such as candelilla wax, carnauba wax, Japan wax, espartograss wax, cork wax, guaruma wax, rice oil wax, sugar cane wax, ouricury wax, montan wax, sunflower wax, fruit waxes, such as orange waxes, lemon waxes, grapefruit wax, bayberry wax, and animal waxes such as, for example, beeswax, shellac wax, spermaceti, wool wax and uropygial fat. According to the invention, it can be of advantage to use hydrogenated or hardened waxes. Natural waxes usable in accordance with the invention also include the mineral waxes, such as ceresine and ozocerite for example, or the petrochemical waxes, for example petrolatum, paraffin waxes and microwaxes. Other suitable wax components are chemically modified waxes, more particularly the hard waxes such as, for example, montan ester waxes, sasol waxes and hydrogenated jojoba waxes. Synthetic waxes usable in accordance with the invention include, for example, wax-like polyalkylene waxes and polyethylene glycol waxes. Vegetable waxes are preferred for the purposes of the invention.<br>
The wax component may also be selected from the group of wax esters of saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alkanecarboxylic acids and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alcohols, from the group of esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids (for example 12-hydroxystearic acid) and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alcohols and also from the group of lactides<br>

In addition, hydrotropes, for example ethanol, isopropyl alcohol or polyols, may be used to improve flow behavior. Suitable polyols preferably contain 2 to 15 carbon atoms and at least two hydroxyl groups. The polyols may contain other functional groups, more especially amino groups, or may be modified with nitrogen.<br>

Footnotes to the Tables:<br>
RT = room temperature 20°C; r.p.m. = revolutions per minute<br>
1)	Proposed I NCI<br>
2)	Viscosity measurements: Brookfield RVF, spindle 5, 10 revolutions per<br>
minute, 23°C (formulations 21, 22, 23, C1  and 27, 28 to 34) or<br>
Brookfield RVF, spindle TE with Helipath, 4 revolutions per minute,<br>
23°C (formulations 24, 25 and 26)<br>
3)	Evaluation criteria for visual phase stability: 1 = stable; 2 = slight<br>
separations; 3 = separations; 4 = distinct separations; 5 = separations<br>
4)	Evaluation criteria for visual macroscopic appearance: 1 = smooth and<br>
sparkling; 2 = smooth and flat; 3 = flat/coarse structure; 4 = visible<br>
recrystallizates. The formulations were evaluated after thermostatting<br>
to RT.<br>
5)	Evaluation criteria for microscopic appearance: 1 = mean particle size<br>

urn; 4 = mean particle size 13-20 urn; 5 = mean particle size 20 - 50<br>
urn. The particle size of the test emulsion was visually compared with<br>
the particle size of standard emulsions. To determine the particle size<br>
of the standard emulsions, a diffraction pattern is produced by laser<br>
diffraction.   The particle size distribution is then calculated from the<br>
light intensities of these diffraction patterns using the Fraunhofer<br>
theory (Sympatec Helos).<br>
6)	Sensory evaluation criteria:<br>
The sensory evaluation was carried out as follows:<br>
Test group: 10 experienced and trained volunteers; 1 = very high<br>
<br>
acceptance; 2 = average acceptance; 3 = unacceptable 10 µl of the above-mentioned compositions thermostatted beforehand to 20°C were applied by micropipette to the smooth side of the forearms of the volunteers and rubbed in with the fingers of the hands of the contralateral side. The sensory evaluation was carried out during and after absorption. The sensory test was conducted on 10 volunteers, as described in the book "Cosmetic Lipids and the Skin Barrier" (Marcel Dekker, New York, 2002, Ed. Thomas Forster, pp. 319 - 352).<br>
