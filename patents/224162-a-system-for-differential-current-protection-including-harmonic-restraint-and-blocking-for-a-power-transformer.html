SYSTEM FOR POWER TRANSLATION DIFFERENTIAL PROTECTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to transformer<br>
internal fault protection for electric power transformers, and<br>
more specifically concerns differential protection for such a<br>
transformer which includes harmonic restraint and blocking<br>
capability.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is important to first recognize and then take<br>
corrective action in response to the occurrence of internal<br>
faults in a power transformer. Prompt disconnection of the<br>
faulty transformer from the power system is necessary to avoid<br>
possible extensive damage to the transformer as well as to<br>
preserve power system stability and power quality.<br>
Several different techniques have been developed to<br>
detect internal transformer faults, which initially included<br>
phase overcurrent protection, differential protection using<br>
differential currents, and gas accumulator/rate of pressure rise<br>
protective techniques for arcing faults. Differential<br>
protection is currently widely used as protection against relay<br>
internal faults. In differential protection, operating currenc<br>
(IDP) (which may also be referred to as differential current),<br>
is compared with a restraining current (IaT). The operating<br>
current is defined as the phasor sum of currents entering che<br>
protected element {the transformer) as shown in the following<br>
equation and in Figure 1.<br><br>
In Figure 1, the power transformer 10 is protected by<br>
differential relay 11. CT1 and CT2 are current transformers.<br>
The operating current is proportional to the fault current fox<br>
transformer internal faults and approaches zero for non-faulted<br>
conditions. There are several equations for restraining current<br>
including the following equation.<br><br>
where k is a compensation factor, usually 1 or 0.5. A trip signal<br>
is gnerated if the operating current is greater than a selected<br>
percentage of the restraining current.<br>
Conventional differential protection arrangements may<br>
misoperate, however, in the presence of what are known as<br>
transformer inrush currents, which are the result of transients<br>
in the magnetic flux within the transformer.<br>
It has been recognized that the harmonic content of the<br>
differential current provides information which can help to<br>
differentiate actual internal faults from an inrush condition.<br>
Restraining techniques have been used which utilize all the<br>
harmonics of the differential current to distinguish inrush<br>
currents from internal fault conditions, so as to restrain a<br>
tripping action which would otherwise occur when there is in fact<br>
no internal fault.<br>
As indicated above, known differential restraining<br>
protection typically uses all of the harmonics, or a combination<br>
or selected odd and even harmonics, of the differential current.<br>
A blocking arrangement, which results in blocking of the trip<br>
signal, has also been used . in one blocking arrangement, a<br>
second harmonic of the differential current is used. Existing<br>
transformer differential relays thus use either all harmonic<br>
restraining or blocking techniques to distinguish between<br>
internal faults and inrush conditions. In addition, a fifth<br>
harmonic restraining technique has been used to prevent<br>
misoperation in response to transformer over-excitation, as<br>
opposed to internal faults.<br>
These restraining and/or blocking techniques have resulted<br>
in increased security relative to inrush and transformer over-<br>
excitation, but can result in a delay of .......................<br>
tripping action for actual internal faults under certain<br>
conditions.<br>
Other techniquer, such xto recognition of wave shape<br>
distortion and recognition of the time interval during wnicn the<br>
differential current iff near zero, have been used still other<br>
techniques include recognition ot DC offset or asymmetry in the<br>
differential current and the comparison of the amplituded of<br>
positive and negative thresholds of differential current, with<br>
the selected thresholds being in two different—polarized<br>
elements. These techniques are often used as enhansments to<br>
the basic restraining and/or blocking functions described above.<br>
However, no combination of these techniques, have—been found<br>
which provide an adacuate solution, i.e accuracy for several<br>
opooifie inrush condition.<br>
Hence, there romaine an opportunity for significant<br>
improvement in distinguishing internal faults from inrush and<br>
over-excitation conditions for particular power system operating<br>
conditions.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is for power<br>
transformer differential protection and comprises: means for<br>
developing a differential current value from processed current<br>
value which are representative of transformer (CT) secondary<br>
current values obtained from the windings of a power<br>
transformer; means for developing an operating current value<br>
from said differential current value; means for developing a<br>
restraining current value from said processed current values;<br>
means for obtaining even harmonic values of said differential<br>
current value; and means for comparing the sum of the<br>
restraining current values and the even harmonic values with the<br>
operating current value and for producing an output signal which<br>
in turn is useful in producing a trip signal when the operating<br>
current value to larger than said sum.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The system of the present invention, which typically<br>
will be implemented as part, of a protective relay for a power<br>
transformer, includes preferably three differential element<br>
arrangements. Bach of the three differential<br>
elements/arrangements operates substantially identically, and<br>
can generally be considered as associated, respectively, as<br>
operating with the electric currents of a single phase (A, B or<br>
C) or a selected combination of phase currents, e.g. AB, BC and<br>
CA, for the three-phase power transformer. Accordingly, the<br>
following explanation is directed generally, except for a first<br>
portion which produces input values for all three differential<br>
elements, toward the structure and operation of one differential<br>
element arrangement. The other two differential element<br>
arrangements are substantially identical, both in structure and<br>
function, to the one element.<br>
Overall, the differential element arrangement of the<br>
present invention provides differential protection by means of<br>
an even harmonic restraining function and fifth harmonic and DC<br>
blocking functions. In addition, even harmonic blocking may be<br>
selected by the user as an alternative to even harmonic<br>
restraint.<br>
In applicants' invention/ the even harmonic<br>
restraining function may be used alone as a novel and unobvious<br>
alternative to existing differential protection systems, while<br>
fifth harmonic and DC blocking functions may be used<br>
individually with the even harmonic restraint function or used<br>
in combination with the even harmonic restraint function.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram for the initial<br>
acquisition of the electrical current values from winding one of<br>
the power system transformer being protected, as well as the<br>
subsequent filtering, scaling and compensation thereof. Similar<br>
circuits are provided for the other windings.<br>
The input currents to the system of Figure 2 are the<br>
transformer secondary currents from winding 1 of the power<br>
transformer operating off the power line. These currents are<br>
shown generally at block 15 in Figure 2. These input currents<br>
are then applied to a system of analog low pass filters and<br>
analog-to-digital converters to produce filtered, digitized<br>
current samples. This arrangement is conventional and well-<br>
known and is represented in Figure 2 by a data acquisition block<br>
16. The digitized current samples from data acquisition system<br>
16 is applied to four digital band pass filters 17, 18, 20 and<br>
22 and also to a DC filter 24. The outputs of these filters are<br>
then processed by identical conventional scaling circuits 28-28,<br>
with selected scale values, referred to as "tap" values, the<br>
outputs of which are passed to connection compensation circuits<br>
30-30 to provide the output currents for winding 1 of the<br>
transformer.<br>
The output currents represented in blocks 31 through<br>
34, are for the three differential elements and are referred to,<br>
respectively, as I1, I2, I3, from winding 1 of the transformer,<br>
including specifically the compensated fundamental, second<br>
harmonic, fourth harmonic and fifth harmonic values of the<br>
differential current, while the output currents represented in<br>
blocks 36 and 37 are the results of the DC filter 24 which<br>
receives the current samples from data acquisition block 16 and<br>
then forms one cycle sums of the positive (P) and negative (N)<br>
values of the samples. The output currents shown in blocks<br>
31-27 are also referred to as processed winding currents.<br>
As indicated above, Figure 2 shows the acquisition<br>
and initial processing of the secondary currents from winding 1<br>
of the transformer being protected, for all three differential<br>
element arrangements. The following explanation, however,<br>
concerns the structure and operation of only one differential<br>
element arrangement.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, the processed winding<br>
current values I1W1F1C and I1W2F1C are applied to an adder 42.<br>
These signals are current values (I1) for the first differential<br>
element, specifically the compensated (C) fundamental quantity<br>
(F1) for windings 1 (W1) and 2 (W2) of the transformer. The<br>
output of adder 42 is converted to an absolute value by circuit<br>
44, the output of which is the operating current value, IOPl.<br>
Wn is a shorthand representation for W1W2. This current value is<br>
applied to the plus input of a comparator 46. Applied to the<br>
minus input is a threshold value, identified as U87P. The value<br>
of U87P is selected to provide instantaneous overcurrent<br>
protection relative to the value of IOP1, a conventional and<br>
well-known protective relay function.<br>
The IOPl current value is also applied to the plue<br>
input of a comparator 50. Applied to the minus input of<br>
comparator 50 is a threshold current referred to as 087P. The<br>
value of O87P is a selected minimum pickup value necessary for a<br>
valid tripping function. Typically, this is a unitless value<br>
within a range of 0.1-1.2 multiples of the tap scale value. The<br>
output of comparator SO is applied as an enable input to a<br>
comparator 54. Comparator 54 will thus not produce an output<br>
unless the IOPl current is above a selected minimum value. The<br>
IOP1 operating current value is also applied to the plua input<br>
of comparator 54.<br>
The absolute values of the processed winding current<br>
values I1W1F1C and I1W2F1C, respectively, from Figure 2 are<br>
produced by circuits 58 and 60. The outputs of the absolute<br>
value circuits are applied to an adder 61. The output of adder<br>
61 is scaled at block 62. While the scaler value in the<br>
embodiment shown is one-half, which is preferred, it could also<br>
be 1.0. The output of scaler 62 is the restraining current,<br>
referred to as IRT1. The restraining current IRTl is applied to<br>
one side of a switch 64 as well as the plus input of a<br>
comparator 68. Applied to the minus input of comparator 68 is a<br>
threshold value, referred to as IRS1. IRS1 in the embodiment<br>
shown is approximately 3 multiples of the tap scale value. The<br>
output of comparator 68 controls the position of switch 64. The<br>
two switch positions lead to circuits which modify the value of<br>
the restraining current by different slope characteristics to<br>
produce what is referred to as a restraint quantity. The slope<br>
characteristic generally defines the boundary between operation<br>
(trip) and restraining functions of the relay. The two possible<br>
slope modifications of ZRTl are shown in blocks 70 and 72. It<br>
is either a single slope modification (block 70) or a dual slope<br>
modification (block 72) . The output of blocks 70 and 72 is a<br>
restraint current quantity IRT/(9LP1, SLP2, IRSl) and is<br>
applied as an input to an adder 76.<br>
Referring still to Figure 3, the processed winding<br>
current values I1W1F2C and I1W2F2C from Figure 2, which are the<br>
compensated second harmonic current values of the currents from<br>
windings 1 and 2 of the transformer, are applied to an adder 77.<br>
The absolute value of the output of adder 76 is produced by<br>
circuit 78, which is then scaled (circuit 80) by a restraining<br>
factor referred to as 100/PCT2. Preferably, this value is<br>
approximately 15% but could be within the range of 5-50%. The<br>
output of scaler 80 is applied to an adder 82, as well as the<br>
plus input of a comparator 84. Similar circuits and circuit<br>
connections are provided for the fourth harmonic values of the<br>
currents from windings 1 and 2. The circuits include an adder<br>
88, an absolute value circuit 90 and a sealer 92.<br>
The output of scaler 92 is applied to adder 82, as<br>
well as the plus input of a comparator 94. The minus inputs to<br>
comparators 84 and 94 in each case is the fundamental quantity<br>
of the differential current IOPl. The closing of switch 96<br>
results in the circuit of Figure 3 operating in a restraining<br>
manner relative to producing a trip signal using the second and<br>
fourth (even) harmonics of the differential current.<br>
The output of adder 96 is applied as another input to<br>
adder 76, the output of which is applied to the minus input of<br>
comparator 54. The output of comparator 54, referred to aa<br>
87R1, is a trip signal, if the blocking portion of the<br>
differential element is not asserted, as discussed hereafter.<br>
The tripping signal is an indication of an internal fault in the<br>
transformer, as opposed to inrush currents.<br>
In summary, when switch 96 is closed, the output of<br>
comparator 54 is in effect restrained by the even harmonic<br>
values of the differential current, preferably the second and<br>
fourth harmonic values, although additional even harmonic values<br>
can be used. With the even harmonic values, a greater IOPl than<br>
otherwise is necessary to produce a trip signal. Further, while<br>
the embodiment shown preferably uses both the second and fourth<br>
harmonics, it is possible to use just the second or some cases<br>
even the fourth harmonic alone in particular circumstances.<br>
Still referring to Figure 3, comparators 84 and 94<br>
produce blocking signals, referred to as 2HB1 and 4HB1,<br>
respectively, which are the result of comparisons between the<br>
second and fourth harmonic values from windings 1 and 2 relative<br>
to the fundamental quantity of the operating current. The<br>
outputs of comparators 84 and 94 are used in the blocking<br>
circuit portions of the differential element when harmonic<br>
blocking is selected.<br>
The blocking signal for the system of the present<br>
invention is produced by the circuit of Pigure 5. The inputs to<br>
the circuit of Pigure S are four blocking signals, including<br>
signals 2HB1 and 4HB1, which are produced by the circuit of<br>
Figure 3, as discussed above. The third blocking signal,<br>
referred to as 5HB1 is the result of a comparison between the<br>
fifth harmonic value of the differential current relative to the<br>
fundamental current IOPl, similar to the comparisons which<br>
produced the 2HB1 and 4HB1 blocking signals. The blocking<br>
signal DCBLl is produced by the circuit of Figure 4.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the sums of the positive (S+)<br>
and negative (S-) current samples over a current cycle are<br>
applied as inputs to a min/max circuit 100. A full cycle of<br>
differential current is shown at 101, while the positive and<br>
negative half-cycles thereof are shown pictorially in blocks 102<br>
and 104. The positive and negative sum values are produced by<br>
the DC filter in Figure 2. The min/max circuit 100 determines<br>
the ratio of the minimum and the maximum of the positive and<br>
negative sums. If the maximum value is greater than a selected<br>
threshold value, the DC ratio (DCR) of the sums is calculated.<br>
This is accomplished by dividing the S+ and S- minimum sum<br>
values by the S+ and S- maximum sum values.<br>
The DCR signal is applied to the minus input of a<br>
comparator 102, while a threshold value, referred to as DCRF, is<br>
applied to the plus input of comparator 102. When the DCR value<br>
is less than the threshold value DCRF, the output of comparator<br>
102 is a blocking signal referred to as DCBLl. Hence, the relay<br>
system blocking condition for DC blocking is in accordance with<br>
the following equation: DCR<dcrf.></dcrf.>
By defining DCR as the ratio of the minimum S+ and S-<br>
sum values to the maximum S+ and S- sum values, differential<br>
currents having similar positive or negative sums are accounted<br>
for. The DCRF value is typically 0.1, although it could be<br>
varied, such as within a range of 0.05-0.5. The DC blocking<br>
function helps to distinguish inrush currents from fault<br>
currents, since unipolar inrush currents typically have<br>
significantly larger positive or negative sums only.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, the blocking portion of<br>
the differential element arrangement of the present invention<br>
produces a blocking signal output if any one of the individual<br>
blocking functions is present. If the even harmonic portion of<br>
Figure 3 is not in use for a restraining function, i.e. if<br>
switch 96 is in an open position, then switch 106 in Figure 5<br>
closes automatically to produce the function of even harmonic<br>
blocking. In such an arrangement disclosed herein, the<br>
differential element arrangement operates in a blocking-only<br>
mode, without any even harmonic restraint function.<br>
The second harmonic and fourth harmonic blocking<br>
signals 2HB1 and 4HB1 from Figure 3, respectively, are applied<br>
to one side of switches 106 and 110. When switch 106 is in a<br>
closed position, either or both of the second and fourth<br>
harmonics can be used for blocking. Thie is accomplished by<br>
connecting switches 108 and 110 as inputs to an OR gate 112, the<br>
output of which is applied to one side of switch 106. Switch<br>
106 is connected to OR gate 114, the output of which, if<br>
present, is the system blocking signal 87BL1. Switches 116 and<br>
118 control the application of the fifth harmonic blocking<br>
signal, 5HB1, and the DC blocking signal, DCBL1 (the output of<br>
Figure 4), to OR gate 114. Hence, the blocking function of the<br>
differential element arrangement can be supplied by second,<br>
fourth and fifth harmonic.. signals which are the result of<br>
comparisons of those signals (scaled) with the operating current<br>
IOP1, as well as by the DC blocking signal DCBLl. If any of<br>
these individual blocking signals is present, the output of<br>
OR gate 114 is the blocking signal B7BL1.<br>
Figure 6 shows a circuit for combining the<br>
restraining function with the blocking function. The output of<br>
the circuit of Figure 6 produces the actual system tripping<br>
signal 87R, which is applied to a circuit breaker. The signal<br>
87R indicates the presence of an internal fault. Figure 6 shows<br>
an "independent blocking" mode arrangement. In this<br>
arrangement, the restraining signals from the three differential<br>
elements in the system are supervised (overridden) by the<br>
blocking signals from the three differential elements. The<br>
restraining signal for each element is applied as one input to<br>
an associated AND gate while the other input is a NOT input for<br>
the blocking function for that particular element. Hence, for<br>
AND gate 126, the restraining signal 87R1 for the first<br>
differential element is applied to one input while the 87BL1<br>
signal is applied to a NOT input thereof. AND gates 126 and 13O<br>
perform similar, independent functions for the other two<br>
differential elements in the system. The outputs of AND gates<br>
126, 128 and 130 are applied to an OR gate 132, the output of<br>
which produces tripping signal 87R if there is a true or high<br>
output from any of the individual AND gates.<br>
The presence of the 87R tripping signal is on<br>
indication that there is an internal fault as opposed to an<br>
inrush or an over-excitation condition; the 87R signal results<br>
in the transformer being taken out of service.<br>
Figure 7 shows an alternative circuit similar to<br>
Figure 3, with an addition of one circuit 136. In Figure 7, if<br>
the second and fourth harmonics are to be used in the<br>
restraining circuit, then switch 96 is closed, as is the case<br>
with Figure 3; otherwise, it is open. Switch 140 is moved to<br>
position No. 1 if the DC current is larger than the RMS (root<br>
mean square) value of the fundamental quantity. otherwise,<br>
switch 140 is moved to position No. 2 and the overall circuit is<br>
identical in operation to that of Figure 3. In switch position<br>
No. l, the restraining quantity is multiplied by the value:<br><br>
Typically, k is a scale factor within the range of 0.5-3.0,<br>
preferably 1.5. IDC and IRMS are values from the differential<br>
current. When the DC component of the fundamental quantity ia<br>
greater than the RMS value of the fundamental quantity, the<br>
restraining output of the second and fourth harmonics is<br>
increaaed, i.e. given a boost.<br>
The above-described invention produces accurate<br>
results (distinguishing between a true internal transformer<br>
fault and selected other operating conditions, notably inrush<br>
 and over-excitation, in a number of operating situations where<br>
previous arrangements have resulted in a misoperation. The use<br>
of the even harmonic currents to help in restraining the<br>
differential relay prevents misoperation in a number of cases.<br>
Adding fifth harmonic blocking and/or DC ratio blocking as<br>
supervision of the second and fourth harmonic restraining<br>
functions provides additional security. Further, the<br>
combination of even harmonic restraint with the DC ratio<br>
blocking provides a good compromise of speed and reliability.<br>
In summary, even harmonic restraining function<br>
improves security for inrush currents with low second harmonic<br>
content and further maintains dependability for internal faults<br>
where there is current transformer (CT) saturation. The use of<br>
the fifth harmonic blocking function in addition guarantees an<br>
appropriate relay response relative to over-excitation of the<br>
transformer, while the DC offset blocking function provides<br>
security for inrush conditions having very low total harmonic<br>
distortion.<br>
Hence, the present invention improves security and<br>
maintains dependability for particular transformer operating<br>
conditions, distinguishing appropriately between operating<br>
conditions which are not faults, and true internal transformer<br>
faults for which the transformer must be removed from service.<br>
Although a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention has been disclosed here for purposes of illustration,<br>
it should be understood that various changes, modifications and<br>
substitutions may be incorporated without departing from the<br>
spirit of the invention, which is defined by the claims which<br>
follow.<br>
