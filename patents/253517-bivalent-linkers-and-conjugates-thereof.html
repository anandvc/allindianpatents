BIVALENT LINKERS AND CONJUGATES THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/590,580, filed July 23, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains to bivalent linkers, and the synthesis and use thereof. In particular, this invention pertains to the synthesis and use of bivalent linkers in preparing vitamin, drug, diagnostic agent, and/or imaging agent conjugates.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Drug, vitamin, diagnostic, and imaging agent conjugates have been used to treat, diagnose, and evaluate various disease states in humans and in animals. In many cases these drug, vitamin, diagnostic, and imaging agent conjugates include intervening linkers separating for example a targeting ligand from a drug, diagnostic agent, or imaging agent. These linkers include a wide variety of bivalent fragments that may be used separately or when linked together for inclusion in conjugates to for example space a drug, diagnostic agent, or imaging apart from other parts of the conjugate, such as for example a vitamin or other targeting ligand. These linkers may also be stable to the metabolic, physiological, or biological conditions present when they are administered to humans and animals, or alternatively these linkers may undergo various routes of cleavage and/or fragmentation under such conditions. There exists a continuing need for bivalent linkers that can be generally used in drug, vitamin, diagnostic, and imaging agent conjugates.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Illustratively, the present invention includes divalent linkers, which are alternatively referred to as bivalent linkers, that may be used to couple, link, bond, attach, or otherwise associate two or more chemical entities.

15<br>
alkylsulfonyl, a carboxylic acid derivative, and the like; ls is either a bond or another bivalent linker; and where V is as defined herein. It is appreciated that other substituents may be optionally present on the cysteine or homocysteine portion of these drug delivery conjugates, such as longer and/or branched alkyl groups, alkoxy groups, alkoxyalkyl groups, and the like. It is to be understood that cyclic variants of the cysteine portion of these drug delivery conjugates are contemplated. In one aspect, Ra is hydrogen, and Rb is alkyl, such as methyl. In another aspect, both Ra and Rb are alkyl, either the same or different, such as both being methyl. In another aspect, Ra and Rb are taken together with attached carbon to form a spiro cyclopropyl.<br>
In another illustrative aspect of the vitamin receptor binding drug delivery conjugate intermediate described herein, the intermediate includes compounds having the formulae:<br><br>
or protected derivatives thereof, where V is the vitamin, or an analog or a derivative thereof, AA is an amino acid, illustratively selected from the naturally occurring amino acids, or stereoisomers thereof, Ra and Rb are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl, including lower alkyl such as C1-C4 alkyl that are optionally branched, or Ra and Rb are taken together with the attached carbon atom to form a carbocyclic ring, Y is hydrogen or a substituent, illustratively an electron withdrawing substituent, including but not limited to nitro, cyano, halo, alkylsulfonyl, a carboxylic acid derivative, and the like, n and m are independently selected integers, such as 1, 2, or 3, and p is an integer such as 1,2, 3, 4, or 5.

It is to be understood that cyclic variants of the cysteine portion of these drug delivery conjugates are contemplated. AA can also be any other amino acid, such as any amino acid having the general formula:<br><br><br>
20150-78429<br>
16<br>
where R is hydrogen, alkyl. acyl, or a suitable nitrogen protecting group, R' and R" are hydrogen or a substituent, each of which is independently selected in each occurrence, and q is an integer such as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Illustratively, R' and/or R" independently correspond to, but are not limited to, hydrogen or the side chains present on naturally occurring amino acids, such as methyl, benzyl, hydroxymethyl, thiomethyl, carboxyl, carboxylmethyl, guanidinopropyl, and the like, and derivatives and protected derivatives thereof. The above described formula includes all stereoisomeric variations. For example, the amino acid may be selected from asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, lysine, glutamine, arginine, serine, ornitine, threonine, and the like. In another illustrative aspect of the vitamin receptor binding drug delivery conjugate intermediate described herein, the drug, or an analog or a derivative thereof, includes an alkylthiol nucleophile.<br>
It is appreciated that the bivalent linkers described herein may undergo cleavage under certain chemical, environmental, or physiological conditions. In particular, the bivalent linkers described herein may undergo cleavage under physiological conditions, such as by the action of a glutathione mediated mechanism. In such embodiments, those linkers may be alternatively referred to as releasable linkers.<br>
Illustrative mechanisms for cleavage of the bivalant linkers described herein include the following 1,4 and 1,6 fragmentation mechanisms<br><br><br>
20150-78429<br>
17<br>
where X is an exogenous or endogenous nucleophile, glutathione, or bioreducing agent, and the like, and either of Z or Z' is the vitamin, or analog or derivative thereof, or the drug, or analog or derivative thereof, or a vitamin or drug moiety in conjunction with other portions of the bivalent linker. It is to be understood that although the above fragmentation mechanisms are depicted as concerted mechanisms, any number of discrete steps may take place to effect the ultimate fragmentation of the bivalent linker to the final products shown. For example, it is appreciated that the bond cleavage may also occur by acid catalyzed elimination of the carbamate moiety, which may be anchimerically assisted by the stabilization provided by either the aryl group of the beta sulfur or disulfide illustrated in the above examples. In those variations of this embodiment, the releasable linker is the carbamate moiety. Alternatively, the fragmentation may be initiated by a nucleophilic attack on the disulfide group, causing cleavage to form a thiolate. The thiolate may intermolecularly displace a carbonic acid or carbamic acid moiety and form the corresponding thiacyclopropane. In the case of the benzyl-containing bivalent linkers, following an illustrative breaking of the disulfide bond, the resulting phenyl thiolate may further fragment to release a carbonic acid or carbamic acid moiety by forming a resonance stabilized intermediate. In any of these cases, the releaseable nature of the illustrative bivalent linkers described herein may be realized by whatever mechanism may be relevant to the chemical, metabolic, physiological, or biological conditions present. General disulfide formation<br>
Disulfide groups can be generally formed by reacting an alkyl or aryl sulfonylthioalkyl derivative, or the corresponding heteroaryldithioalkyl derivative such as a pyridin-2-yldithioalkyl derivative, and the like, with an alkylenethiol derivative, as illustrated in Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
20150-78429<br>
18<br>
Solvents that can be used for this reaction include THF, EtOAc, CH2C12, CHC13, CCU, DMF, DMSO, and the like. The temperature range employed in this transformation may vary between 0 °C and 80 °C. The required alkyl or aryl sulfonylthioalkyl derivative may be prepared using art-recognized protocols, and also according to the method of Ranasinghe and Fuchs, Synth. Commun. 18(3), 227-32 (1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Other methods of preparing unsymmetrical dialkyl disulfides are based on a transthiolation of unsymmetrical heteroaryl-alkyl disulfides, such as 2-thiopyridinyl, 3-nitro-2-thiopyridinyl, and like disulfides, with alkyl thiol, as described in WO 88/01622, European Patent Application No. 0116208A1, and U.S. Patent No. 4,691,024, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. General carbonate thiocarbonate and carbamate formation<br>
Carbonates, thiocarbonates, and carbamates can generally be formed by reacting an hydroxy-substituted compound, a thio-substituted compound, or an amine-substituted compound, respectively, with an activated alkoxycarbonyl derivative where X is a suitable leaving group, as illustrated in Scheme 2.<br><br>
where Q is oxygen, sulfur, optionally substituted nitrogen, optionally protected nitrogen, and the like.

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1: 6-Trifluoromethyl-l-[2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethoxycarbonyloxy]benzotriazole<br>
Example 1 was prepared according to Scheme 3.<br><br>
(a) 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), CH2C12; (b) Et2O; (c) CH3CH.<br>
Step (a). A solution of 4-(dimethylamine)pyridine (3.0 g; 24.68 mmol; 1.03 eqs.) in 10 mL anhydrous methanol was added to a suspension of 2-(2-pyridyldithio)ethanol hydrochloride (compound (la); C7H9NS2O-HC1; 5.4 g; 24 mmol) in 10 ml of anhydrous methanol, and the mixture was stirred to form a clear solution. Within a few minutes, the solution turned turbid with the formation of a fine suspension, and this suspension was purified by flash chromatography (FC). FC was performed by using 140 g silica gel 60 with 5% methanol in CH2Cl2 to form a 24 cm x 4.3 cm silica gel bed with 500 ml solvent reservoir. The said suspension in 20 mL CH2C12 was loaded and the column was eluted with 5% methanol in CH2C12 with standard collection of 30 mL fractions coupled with UV-detection. The product compound (lb) can be detected from fraction 2 to 9 by TLC (1:1 Hexane: EtOAc).<br>
Step (b). 1 -Hydroxy-6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazole (compound (2); C7H4F3N3O; 2.3 g; 0.11 mol; Aldrich) was dissolved in 770 mL ether and the supernatant was decanted into a 2L RB flask Trichloromethyl chloroformate (compound (3); C2Cl4O2; 107 g; 0.053 mol; 6.0 mL) was added into this clean<br><br>

colorless solution at room temperature over a 15 minutes period. The mixture was gently heated to temperature between 40-50 °C for 1 hour, and cooled to room temperature. The solution was filtered, and the precipitate was washed with ether (10 x 30 mL). The precipitate was a white powder and was dried with vacuum and gave 16.95 g (74% yield). Additional synthetic details are described by Ogura et al, in Synthesis, 1987, 557-560, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Step (c). A solution of compound (lb) (ca. 7.5 mmol) in 10 mL acetonitrile was added over a 2 minutes period to a stirred clean solution of compound 4 (3.46 g; 8 mmol) in 300 ml acetonitrile at room temperature. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. TLC analysis of the mixture was performed after 24 hours. The mixture was allowed to be stirred for additional 14 hours to a total of 38 hours. The mixture was concentrated and washed with 50 mL of IN NaHCO3 eq. and 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was separated, washed further with 1 N NaHCO3 eq. (1x10 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and filtered, to give a white solid powder, which was dried on vacuum for 5 hours and gave 2.54 g. EXAMPLE 2<br>
Example 2 was prepared according to Scheme 4.<br><br>
2-(2-pyridyldithio)ethanol hydrochloride (compound (lb); 8.8 g; 39.33 mL) was dissolved in 78 mL CH2C12, and 2 eqs. of pyridine (C5H5N; 80.88 mL) was added. para-Nitrophenyl chloroformate (compound (6); 8.08 g; 40 mmol) was dissolved in 80 mL CH2Cl2, and the solution was added to mixture of 2-(2-pyridyldithio)ethanol hydrochloride and pyridine over a 15 minutes period. The resultant clear solution was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. TLC analysis for the above mixture after 15 hours stirring indicated completion of the reaction. The mixture was then filtered to remove precipitated pyridine hydrochloride. The light<br><br>

yellow clear filtrate was washed with deionized water (2 x 50 mL) to remove the dissolved pyridine hydrochloride, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated with vacuum (13.8 g). Silica gel 60 (250 g) in CH2Cl2 was used to from a 50 cm x 4.2 cm of silica gel bed with 250 mL solvent reservoir. The product compound (7), ca. 13.8 g, was dissolved in 15 mL (10 mL + 5 mL) of CH2Cl2 and the solution was loaded with an elution ratio of 30 mL/min with standard collection of 30 mL fractions coupled with UV- detection and gave 13.3 g (96% yield). EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example 3 was prepared according to Scheme 5.<br><br>
3-Nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl chloride (compound (8)) was dissolved in 15 mL anhydrous CH2CI2. The solution was cooled by an ice bath. 4-ethanoyl thiophenol (compound (9)) was dissolved in 10 mL CH2Cl2 and added to a dropping funnel affixed to the container containing 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl chloride solution. The solution of 4-ethanoyl thiophenol was added over a 2 to 5 minute period. After the solution of 4-ethanoyl thiophenol was added, the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred for 2 hours. While addition of 4-ethanoyl thiophenol, a precipitate formed. After the 2 hours period of stirring at room temperature was completed, the mixture was sonicated for 5 minutes and the precipitate dissolved. TLC analysis showed a new spot formed in addition to 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulfenyl chloride and 4-ethanoyl thiophenol. The reaction mixture was washed with saturated NaHCO3. The organic layer was supplemented with an addition 100 mL Ch2Cl2. The product was dried for 3 hours under vacuum.<br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Example 4 was prepared according to Scheme 6. Scheme 6<br>
Compound (10) (0.025 g; 0.085 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 under stirring. para-Nitrophenyl cholorofo'mate (compound (11); 0.020 g; 1.2 eq.) was added along with 1 eq. of triethylamine (TEA) to the stirring solution. TLC analysis showed that compound (10) was consumed after 2 hours. The product compound (12) was isolated by column chromatography (7:3 Hexane: EtOAc). EXAMPLE 5: General preparation of compounds containing a cysteine disulfide bond.<br>
Any of thiosulfonates (13) (1 eq.), prepared according to the method of Ranasinghe and Fuchs, Synth. Commun. 18(3), 227-32 (1988), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, are reacted with drugs, drug analogs, or drug derivatives (14) (1 eq.) to prepare the drug thiosulfonates (15) as a solution in methanol, as shown in Scheme 7.<br><br><br>
20150-78429<br>

Referring to Scheme 7, R is alkyl or aryl, L is a suitable leaving group, such as halogen, pentafluorophenyl, and the like, n is an integer from 1 to about 4, and X is -O-, -NH-, -C(O)O-, or -C(O)NH-. Conversion is conveniently monitored by observing the disappearance of each starting material by TLC (silica gel; CHCb/MeOH = 9/1). Final yield was 83% (mass of removed product was 32 mg from a total yield of 38.9 mg).<br>
The folate-containing peptidyl fragment Pte-Glu-(AA)n-Cys-OH (18) is prepared by a polymer-supported sequential approach using the Fmoc-strategy on an acid-sensitive Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-Wang resin (16), as shown in Scheme 8.<br>
Scheme 8<br><br>
(a) 20% piperidine/DMF; (b) Fmoc-AA-OH, PyBop, DIPEA, DMF; (c) Fmoc-Glu(O-t-Bu)-OH, PyBop, DIPEA, DMF; (d) 1. N10(TFA)-Pte-OH; PyBop, DIPEA, DMSO; (e) TFAA, (CH2SH)2, i-Pr3SiH; (f) NH4OH, pH 10.3.<br>
Referring to Scheme 8, R1 is Fmoc, R2 is Trityl, and DIPEA is diisopropylethylamine. PyBop is applied as the activating reagent to ensure efficient coupling. Fmoc protecting groups are removed after each coupling step under standard conditions. Appropriately protected amino acid building blocks, such as Fmoc-Glu-O/Bu, V-TFA-Pte-OH, and the like, are used, as described in Scheme 8, and represented by in step (b) by Fmoc-AA-OH. Thus, AA refers to any amino acid starting material, that is appropriatedly protected.<br>
The coupling sequence (steps (a) &amp; (b)) involving Fmoc-AA-OH is performed "n" times to prepare solid-supported peptide (17), where n is an integer and may equal 0 to about 100. Following the last coupling step, the remaining Fmoc<br><br>
20150-78429<br>
24<br>
group is removed, and the peptide is sequentially coupled to a glutamate derivative (step (c)), deprotected, and coupled to TFA-protected pteroic acid (step (d)). Subsequently, the peptide is cleaved from the polymeric support upon treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, ethanedithiol, and triisopropylsilane (step (e)). These reaction conditions result in the simultaneous removal of the t-Bu, t-Boc, and Trt protecting groups. The TFA protecting group is removed upon treatment with base (step (f)) to provide the folate-containing Cys-containing peptidyl fragment (18).<br>
Drug conjugates are prepared by reacting folate derivative (18) (0.9 -0.95 eq.) with drug thiosulfonate (15) in deionized water (0.04 M, pH adjusted to 7 with 0.1 N NaHCO3) under argon for about 30 minutes, forming a disulfide bond. Upon evaporation of the methanol in vacuo, the conjugate may be purified by preparative HPLC (Prep Novapak HR C18 19 X 300 mM column; mobile phase (A)-1.0 mM phosphate buffer, pH = 6; organic phase (B)-acetonitrile; conditions-gradient from 99% A and 1% B to 50% A and 50% B in 30 minutes, flow rate = 15 mL/minute). EXAMPLES 6a-6f<br>
Examples 6a-6f were prepared by the following general procedure. To a well stirred solution of the corresponding drug having an -OH group (1 eq. in dry CH2Cl2 or dry THF) was added under argon 6-(trifluoromethyl)benzotriazolyl 2-(2'-pyridyldithioethyl carbonate (1.3 eq.) and NN-dimethylaminopyridine (1.5 eq.). The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 h, and the pyridyldithio-derivatized drug was isolated by silica chromatography (&gt; 65% for each example). The corresponding peptidyl fragment (0.5 eq.), prepared according to the procedures described herein and alternatively by conventional procedures, such as those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US-2005-0002942-A1, was dissolved in DMSO. To the resulting clear yellow solution was added the pyridyl-dithio derivatized drug. After 30 min, the reaction was completed and the conjugate purified by HPLC. In the case of Example 6e, the peptidyl fragment Pte-Glu-Asp-Arg-Asp-Asp-Cys-OH was first dissolved in water, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2.5 with 0.1 N HC1, causing the peptidyl fragment to precipitate. The peptidyl fragment was collected by centrifugation, dried, and dissolved in DMSO for subsequent reaction with the pyridyldithio-derivatized drug.<br><br>
