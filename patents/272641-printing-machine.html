Printing Machine<br>
The invention relates io a printing machine, in particular for printing labels, including a machine support structure that comprises a support element, and at least one printing unit at least part of which is received in the support element by means of a bearing element.<br>
For many years printing machines and individual components used in printing machines have on a large scale been made of metallic materials, in particular of steels, aluminum, or titanium. Apart from the fact that these materials meet the requirements in terms of some of their physical and technical characteristics, the fact that these materials have become widely used is. among other factors, obviously due to the easy availability of both qualitative skills and quantitative capacities in terms of the production and adequate processing of metallic materials. In printing machines that operate in accordance with the latest printing technology the machine support structure usually consists of large casts of metallic materials. To be molded into the desired shape, these casts require technically complex and frequently expensive processing. The use of metallic materials in modern printing technology generally requires auxiliary technical measures in order to counteract certain undesirable physical properties of these materials such as electric conductivity, thermal expansion, mechanical vibration behavior, or consequences of these properties.<br>
One of the largest and commercially most important sectors that use modern printing technology is the production of labels. The document WO 2005/028202 A1, for example, discloses a label printing machine with individual drives for individual in-line printing units. In the printing machine, a web of printing material is processed to produce multicolor labels fmished with special effects as desired. The printing processes employed in the label printing machine may vary in accordance with the print job so that different formats can be processed and different processes can be employed to meet a wide range of product requirements. For this purpose, the label printing machine has a number of disconnection points where printing units or printing unit parts that use different printing processes, in particular flexographic printing, gravure, offset printing, and screen printing, can be connected and disconnected. When a printing unit or a printing unit part is<br>
 <br>
connected at a disconnection po. it. a drive connection to an individual drive for the printing unit or printing unit part is simultaneously established. The label printing machine described in WO 2005/028202 Al is manufactured in a conventional way from metallic<br>
casts.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a stable printing machine that reduces or avoids negative consequences of undesirable properties of metallic materials.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is attained by a printing machine that has the features set forth in Claim I. Advantageous developments of the invention are characterized in the dependent claims.<br>
A printing machine according to the invention, in particular for printing and/or producing labels includes a machine support structure with a support element that is at least partially made of rock, and includes at least one printing unit at least part of which is received in the support element by means of a bearing element.<br>
In connection with the invention, the term "rock' as it is used in the present description is understood to mean a solid mineral mass or a single object consisting of a material of this type. In the context of the present description, the term "rock" as it is used herein is understood to be synonymous with the term "stone". The rock may be natural or artificial. Natural rock is a solid mineral mass created in the course of geology, part of the inorganic components of the earth's crust or an individual object made of this material. Natural rock may be created by solidification of molten minerals (basalt, granite, volcanic rock) or by solidification of loose materials (sandstone, limestone). Artificial rocks are produced in technical processes.<br>
The support element is made of rock, in particular of one rock or several rocks, preferably entirely of rock. Large parts of the machine support structure or the entire machine support structure in particular may be made of stone. It is preferred that the entire printing unit is received in the support element.<br>
 <br>
The bearing element may be connected to the support element so as to be releasable or non-releasable. The bearing element may in particular be a bushing or a hinge bearing or a pivot bearing or a grooved rail made of a metallic material. The bearing element ma\ be fixed to the rock support element by adhesi\ e bonding or screwing and may in particular be glued in or screwed in. The bearing element may also be an insert in the support element. The bearing element may be part of the printing unit or part of the machine support structure. If it is part of the printing unit, it may be a component of the printing unit, in particular a shaft, or a subassembly of the printing unit. The printing unit may be used to apply ink, varnish, clear varnish, or a substrate such as foil, a hologram, or a RFID circuit to a printing substrate. A printing unit may in particular comprise an inking unit and/or a dampening unit. Further parts of the printing press may be received in the support element directly, without a bearing element, or indirectly, by means of a bearing element. For example control components and/or drive components and/or processing devices such as dryers or cutting units in particular may be fixed to the support element. The support structure may also be referred to as a frame construction, a machine structure, or a support construction. The printing machine is preferably a rotary printing press.<br>
The machine support structure, in particular the support element, is part of the printing press and not part of the surroundings in which the printing machine is placed. The support element is not to be considered as separate or independent of the printing press. In particular, the support element is not a support surface, a platform, a support element,'a shop floor, a print shop foundation, a floor plate, or an intermediate platform for a printing machine. In other words, the printing unit or printing units are received in the support element rather than on the support element as part of a printing press.<br>
The present invention advantageously provides a printing press that is inherently stable even under changing thermal conditions. The coefficient of expansion of rock is considerably lower than that of metals. The support element of the printing press according to the invention is inherently stable also in terms of mechanical forces acting on the support element. In particular, it is more rigid or more stable than the metal materials that are<br>
 <br>
commonly used. moreover. rock has better vibration damping properties than the metal materials that are commonly used, Finally; rock is also an electric insulator, a fact which means thai no corrosion occurs. Rock as a raw material can be processed with high precision, so that a very precise geometry of the suppoit element and thus a support element of high quality can be achieved,<br>
The printing machine according to the invention even has commercia! advantages because complex and expensive surface treatments for protective and/or aesthetic reasons, for example coatings or paint are no longer required. Production costs for comparable components made of metal materials may actually be considerably higher than those for components made of rock because processing, measuring, testing and assembling of components made of metal materials may be more complicated.<br>
In the printing machine according to the invention the support element made of rock may provide a major part or all of the bearing forces required for positioning the at least one part of the printing unit in space and/or the compensation force for the gravitational force acting on the part of the printing unit. In other words, the support element is primarily used for mounting or fixing the printing unit of the printing machine according to the invention.<br>
In some embodiments of the printing machine according to the invention, a plurality of printing units may be received in the support element. In addition or as an alternative, the machine support structure may include a plurality of support elements that are made of<br>
rock.<br>
The support element(s) may be made of one piece, i.e. they may be a monoblock or monolith. The one piece (also referred to as a single piece) may be erected to be vertical, like a wall, in particular a side wall of a printing machine. In these embodiments, the one-piece rock is used to receive all printing units in an in-line arrangement, in particular in the horizontal direction. In such an embodiment, table blocks and/or cross pieces may advantageously be dispensed with. This may save costs, in particular production costs, and simplify transportation. At the most, the one-piece rock may rest on separate feet, base<br>
 <br>
profiles, or the like. It should be noted that the different expansion propenies of metallic and mineral materials do not pose a problem in the one-piece construction because in the longitudinal direction. onl\' mineral materials are provided, whereas the metallic components extend perpendicular to the one-piece rock. Due to the lack of metal connections in the longitudinal direction, undesirable length changes or expansions are avoided.<br>
The support element made of rock of the printing machine according to the invention may in particular be a base frame, a machine frame, a machine foundation, a base plate, a base unit, a printing unit frame, a printing unit support, a side part, a side wall a side frame, a support frame, a portal support, or a connecting profile. ■<br>
In a first group of embodiments of the printing machine according to the invention, the rock is a natural rock. In other words, the support element may be made of a type of rock found in nature. This natural type of rock may in particular be an extrusive rock, an intrusive rock, a dike rock, an eruptive rock, or a metamorphic rock. The natural stone is preferred to be granite, granite-like, granite porphyry, gneiss, or marble. In particularly advantageous embodiments, the natural stone is black granite, gabbro, or impala granite.<br>
The most preferred rock is impala granite. The expansion coefficient of impala granite is only one fifth of that of cast steel.<br>
In a second group of embodiments of the printing machine according to the invention the rock is an artificial rock. This artificial rock may in particular be concrete or a ceramic.<br>
A particularly advantageous type of concrete has a tensile strength of more than 200 N/cin" and has a homogenous structure. The concrete may be armed concrete.<br>
With reference to artificial rock, an embodiment in the shape of a single piece is preferred. Such an embodiment can be implemented in a simple and cost-effective way using artificial rock.<br>
 <br>
In some embodiments, in paticular of ihe first or second group, the support element ma\' be a composite component or composite workpiece made of rock, and at least one further materiak In particular, the further material may be a plastic with a honeycomb structure. In this \Na&gt;- an advantageous reduction of the weight of the component may be attained while maintaining certain properties in terms of solidity and slabilitN.<br>
In particular in an embodiment of the first group, the printing machine according to the invention may be a web-processing printing machine, in particular for label printing. The web-processing printing machine may include a wind-up device for the printed web of printing material. The printing machine ma&gt;' be a narrow-web printing machine. The width of the web of material may be less than 550 mm, in particular less than 340 mm. even less than 285 mm.<br>
In particular in an embodiment of the second group, the printing machine according to the invention may alternatively be a sheet-processing printing machine. A sheet-processing printing machine may include a feeder, a number of printing units (typically 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 printing units, in particular offset printing units), and a delivery. The sheet-processing printing machine may be a perfecting machine (reversing machine), i.e. a printing machine for printing both sides of a printing material in one pass.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the printing machine is a label printing machine. The printing machine may be suitable for producing adhesive labels. The label printing machine may in particular include individual features and combinations of features as disclosed in the document WO 2005/028202 Al. The document WO 2005/02&amp;202 Al is explicitly included by reference herein.<br>
The printing machine may be an offset printing press or may include at least one offset printing unit, possibly in combination with a number of other printing units operating in accordance with different printing processes (hybrid printing machine).<br>
