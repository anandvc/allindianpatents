Stabilizer mixtures for polvolefins<br>
The present invention relates to a stabilizer mixture containing a sterically hindered amine compound and a polymer containing polar residues, the use of this mixture for stabilizing a polyolefin against degradation induced by light, heat or oxidation and the polyolefin thus stabilized.<br>
A stabilizer mixture containing two sterically hindered amine compounds is, for example, described in EP-A-80 431, EP-A-252 877, EP-A-709 426, EP-A-723 990, EP-A-728 806, GB-A-2 301 106, EP-A-741 163 and EP-A-754 723.<br>
US-A-5 643 985 relates to the stabilization of recycled plastics. EP-A-220 897, US-A-5 475 041 and BE-A-775 151 disclose the stabilization of polyolefins.<br>
The present invention relates in particular to a stabilizer mixture containing<br>
(A)	a sterically hindered amine compound, and<br>
(B)	a polymer containing polar residues;<br>
the weight ratio of components (A):(B) being 20:1 to 1:20; with the provisos that<br>
(1)	component (B) is different from component (A) and does not contain groups of the<br>
formula (I) or (II)<br><br>
in which G is hydrogen or methyl, and<br>
GT and G2, independently of one another, are hydrogen, methyl or together are a substituent<br>
=0; and<br>
(2)	component (B) is different from a polymer having an acidic hydrogen atom.<br><br>
A polymer having an acidic hydrogen atom means a polymer having functional groups such as a carboxyl group, a sulfo group, a phospho group and the like. The present component (B) does not cover a polymer having an acidic hydrogen atom as disclosed in EP-A-220 897.<br>
The weight ratio of components (A):(B) is preferably 15:1 to 1:15, in particular 10:1 to 1:10, for example 5:1 to 1:5, 3:1 to 1:3,5:1 to 1:1, 4:1 to 1:1, 3:1 to 1:1 or 2:1 to 1:1. A 1:1 weight ratio is particularly preferred.<br>

The stabilizer mixture according to the present invention is useful for stabilizing polyolefins against degradation induced by light, heat or oxidation. Examples of suitable polyolefins are shown in the following.<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE),<br><br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
a)	radical polymerisation (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br>
b)	catalytic polymerisation using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIII of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either re- or o-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerisation medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerisation or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, Ha and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br><br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1), for example mixtures of polypropylene with polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mixtures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.	Copolymers of monoolefins and diolefins with each other or with other vinyl monomers, for example ethylene/propylene copolymers, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and mixtures thereof with low density polyethylene (LDPE), propylene/but-1-ene copolymers, propylene/isobutylene copolymers, ethylene/but-1-ene copolymers, ethylene/hexene copolymers, ethylene/methylpentene copolymers, ethylene/heptene copolymers, ethylene/octene copolymers, propylene/butadiene copolymers, isobutylene/isoprene copolymers, ethy-lene/alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/alkyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers and their copolymers with carbon monoxide or ethylene/acrylic acid copo-<br><br>
lymers and their salts (ionomers) as well as terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene such as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene; and mixtures of such copolymers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropylene/ethylene-propylene copolymers, LDPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), LDPE/ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alternating or random polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with other polymers, for example polyamides.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a composition containing a polyolefin and the stabilizer mixture as described herein and to a method for stabilizing a polyolefin against degradation induced by light, heat or oxidation, which comprises incorporating into the polyolefin the stabilizer mixture according to the invention.<br>
The polyolefins listed above under point 1 are preferred. Polyethylene and polypropylene as well as a polyethylene copolymer or a polypropylene copolymer are particularly preferred.<br>
The components of the novel stabilizer mixture can be added to the polyolefin to be stabilized either individually or mixed with one another. The stabilizer mixture (components A and B) is preferably present in an amount of 0.01 to 5 %, in particular 0.05 to 1 %, relative to the weight of the polyolefin.<br>
Component (B) is for example present in an amount of 0.005 to 1.5 %, 0.005 to 1.0 %, 0.01 to 1 %, 0.05 to 1.0 %, 0.05 to 0.5 %, in particular 0.05 to 0.2 % or 0.01 to 0.2 %, relative to the weight of the polyolefin.<br>
The Ca compound (component (XX)) is optionally present in the material to be stabilized in an amount of e.g. 0.005 to 1 %, preferably 0.05 to 0.2 %.<br>
Component (XXX) is optionally present in the material to be stabilized in an amount of e.g. 0.005 to 1 %, in particular 0.05 to 0.2 %, relative to the weight of said material.<br><br>
The weight ratio of the components (A):(XX) is for example 1:10 to 100:1, preferably 1:5 to 5:1, in particular 1:2 to 2:1.<br>
The weight ratio of the components (A):(XXX) is for example 1:10 to 20:1, preferably 1:5 to 5:1, in particular 1:2 to 2:1.<br>
The novel stabilizer mixture or the individual components thereof can be incorporated into the polyolefin by known methods, for example before or during shaping or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compounds to the polyolefin, if necessary with subsequent evaporation of the solvent. The novel stabilizer mixture can be added to the polyolefin in the form of a powder, granules or a masterbatch, which contains the mixture in, for example, a concentration of from 2.5 to 25% by weight.<br>
If desired, the components of the novel stabilizer mixture can be melt blended with each other before incorporation in the polyolefin.<br>
The novel stabilizer mixture or its components can be added before or during the polymerization or before the crosslinking.<br>
The materials stabilized in this way can be used in a wide variety of forms, for example as films, fibres, tapes, moulding compositions, profiles or as binders for paints, adhesives or putties.<br>

The material thus obtained is compression molded in a laboratory press between two aluminum foils for 6 min at 260°C to a 0.5 mm thick film which is cooled immediately to room temperature in a water-cooled press. Samples of 60 mm x 25 mm are cut out of these 0.5 mm films and are exposed in a WEATHER-OMETER Ci 65 (black panel temperature 63±2°C, without water-spraying).<br>
