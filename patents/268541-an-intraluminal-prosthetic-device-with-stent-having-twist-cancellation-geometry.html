STENT HAVING TWIST CANCELLATION GEOMETRY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 (e) to provisional<br>
5      application 60/622,157 filed on October 26, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to expandable intraluminal medical devices for use<br>
within a body passageway or duct, and more particularly to a stent having adjacent hoop<br>
10      sections that are rotationally out of phase, and flexible links that minimize foreshortening and<br>
axial twist during stent deployment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of intraluminal prosthetic devices has been demonstrated to present an<br>
15 alternative to conventional vascular surgery. Intraluminal prosthetic devices are commonly<br>
used in the repair of aneurysms, as liners for vessels, or to provide mechanical support to<br>
prevent the collapse of stenosed or occluded vessels.<br>
Intraluminal endovascular prosthetics involves the percutaneous insertion of a<br>
generally tubular prosthetic device, such as a stent, into a vessel or other tubular structure<br>
20 within the vascular system. The stent is typically delivered to a specific location inside the<br>
vascular system in a compressed state by a catheter. Once delivered to the desired location,<br>
the stent is deployed by expanding the stent into the vessel wall. The expanded stent typically<br>
has a diameter that is several times larger than the diameter of the stent in its compressed<br>
state. The expansion of the stent may be performed by several methods known in the art, such<br>
25      as by a mechanical expansion device (balloon catheter expansion stent) or by self-expansion.<br>
The positioning of the stent within the vessel is a critical factor that affects the<br>
performance of the stent and the success of the medical procedure. Since the region in the<br>
vessel lumen at which the stent is to be deployed is usually very difficult for a physician to<br>
access, it is essential that the stent's deployed diameter and length be known before the<br>
30      physician can accurately position the correctly sized device.<br>
1<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
Careful sizing of the correct stent for the desired region of the vessel lumen may be a<br>
difficult challenge for many physicians.   Although the dimensions of the body vessel at the<br>
region may be known, uncertainty about the stent's exact deployed diameter and length may<br>
lead to less than optimal performance.   One cause for uncertainty in the stent's deployed<br>
5      diameter and length is a condition known as foreshortening.<br>
Foreshortening can be better understood by defining the condition within the context of<br>
change in the stent length before and after deployment. For the purpose of this definition,<br>
"crimped length" describes the starting point of the stent - that is the length of the unexpanded<br>
stent mounted on a delivery catheter prior to deployment.   The term "deployed length" is<br>
10 defined at the clinical end point of change - that is the length of the stent deployed within the<br>
lumen. Foreshortening is equivalent to the distance between these two points, i.e. the<br>
difference between the contained ("crimped") and deployed length.<br>
Foreshortening occurs to varying degrees with all stents. This is especially true for<br>
endovascular stents greater than 4 millimeters in diameter. The amount of stent foreshortening<br>
15 is determined predominately by how the particular stent design accommodates expansion. For<br>
example, self-expanding stents are commonly deployed by operation of a retractable sheath.<br>
As the sheath is retracted the distal end of the stent is released first. Foreshortening can occur<br>
within this distal segment until the stent anchors on the lumen wall. As the sheath retraction<br>
continues, the proximal segment will foreshorten as it is deployed.<br>
20                    Balloon-expandable stents also foreshorten during expansion.    Stents deployed by<br>
standard catheter balloons invariably see the balloon inflate at the weakest section first.<br>
Typically, the weakest section of the balloon will be at the exposed distal and/or proximal ends,<br>
i.e. the sections of the balloon not supported directly by the catheter or the stent. Accordingly,<br>
as the balloon is expanded the proximal end and/or distal end(s) of the balloon will inflate first.<br>
25 The inflated end(s) of the stent will experience the pressure of the balloon pressing outward in<br>
a radial direction to expand the stent, and also inwardly in an axial compressive direction. This<br>
axial compressive force causes the weaker connecting links or "flex links" of the stent to<br>
compress, causing the stent to foreshorten.<br>
What is needed is an intraluminal medical device that will accommodate the device<br>
30      expansion into the wall of the lumen, while minimizing device foreshortening.<br>

5      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention describes an intraluminal medical device having phased<br>
structural sections that will accommodate the device expansion into the wall of a vessel lumen,<br>
while minimizing foreshortening of the device caused by axial compression of the device<br>
components. An intravascular stent will be described for the purpose of example. However, as<br>
10 the term is used herein, intraluminal medical device includes but is not limited to any<br>
expandable intravascular prosthesis, expandable intraluminal vascular graft, stent, or any other<br>
mechanical scaffolding device used to maintain or expand a body passageway Further, in this<br>
regard, the term "body passageway" encompasses any duct within a mammalian's body, or any<br>
body vessel including but not limited to any vein, artery, duct, vessel, passageway, trachea,<br>
15      ureters, esophagus, as well as any artificial vessel such as grafts.<br>
The structure and flexible component according to the present invention. may be<br>
incorporated into any radially expandable stent design, including self-expanding stents and<br>
mechanically expanded stents. Mechanically expanded stents include, but are not limited to<br>
stents that are radially expanded by an expansion member, such as by the expansion of a<br>
20      balloon.<br>
With reference to the drawing figures, like parts are represented by like reference<br>
numerals throughout the various different figures. By way of example, strut 108 in Figure 1 is<br>
equivalent to strut 308 in Figure 3.<br>
Referring to Figures 1-5, there are illustrated exemplary stents 100, 300 as are known<br>
25 in the art. Figures 1 and 3 illustrate typical prior art stents 100, 300 in an unexpanded or<br>
crimped, pre-deployed state, while Figures 2 and 5 show the stents 100, 300 in the fully<br>
expanded state. Although Z or S shaped pattern stents are shown for the purpose of example,<br>
the illustration is not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention.<br>
Turning now to Figures 1 and 2, a stent 100 comprises a tubular configuration of<br>
30      structural elements having proximal and distal open ends 102, 104 and defining a longitudinal<br>
5<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
axis 103 extending there between. The stent 100 has a first diameter D1 for insertion into a<br>
patient and navigation through the vessels, and a second diameter D2 for deployment into the<br>
target area of a vessel, with the second diameter being greater than the first diameter.<br>
The stent 100 structure comprises a plurality of adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d) extending<br>
5 between the proximal and distal ends 102, 104. The hoops 106(a)-(d) include a plurality of<br>
longitudinally arranged strut members 108 and a plurality of loop members 110 connecting<br>
adjacent struts 108. Adjacent struts 108 are connected at opposite ends in a substantially S or<br>
Z shaped pattern so as to form a plurality of cells. However, one of ordinary skill in the art<br>
would recognize that the pattern shaped by the struts is not a limiting factor in this invention,<br>
10 and other shaped patterns may be used. The plurality of loops 110 have a substantially semi-<br>
circular configuration and are substantially symmetric about their centers. Adjacent hoop<br>
sections 106 (a)-(d)are in the same circumferential orientation. That is to say, adjacent loop<br>
members 110 are axially aligned along the longitudinal axis.<br>
The stent 100 structure further comprises a plurality of bridge members or flex links<br>
15 114, which connect adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d). Each flex link 114 comprises two ends. Each<br>
one end of each flex link 114 is attached to one loop 110 on one hoop, for example hoop<br>
106(c), and the other end of each flex link 114 is attached to one loop 110 on an adjacent hoop,<br>
for example hoop 106(d). The flex links 114 connect adjacent hoops 106(a)-(d) together at flex<br>
link to loop connection regions.<br>
20                    The Figures generally show a stent having a closed cell design, with the flex links 114<br>
connected to the adjacent hoop 106 at each loop 110. In any of the described configurations,<br>
the connections between the hoop structures 106 and the adjacent flex link 114 may be made<br>
at every loop member 110; or alternatively, at a subset of the loop members 110 around the<br>
circumference of the hoop 106.    In other words, the connected loop members 110 may<br>
25 alternate with unconnected loop members 110 in some defined pattern around the<br>
circumference of hoop section 106.<br>
Figures 3 and 5 illustrate a typical stent 300 as is know in the prior art. As<br>
shown in Figure 3, stent 300 is in its crimped, pre-deployed state, as it would appear if it were<br>
cut longitudinally and then laid out flat in a 2-dimensional configuration.  Similarly, stent 300 in<br>
30      Figure 5 is a 2-dimensional representation of the cylindrical stent 300 after deployment; i.e.<br>
6<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
after radially outward expansion. It should be clearly understood that the stent 300 depicted in<br>
Figures 3 and 5 is in fact cylindrical in shape, similar to stent 100 shown in Figure 1, and is only<br>
shown in the flat configuration for the purpose of illustration. This cylindrical shape would be<br>
obtained by rolling the flat configuration of Figures 3 and 5 into a cylinder with the top points "C"<br>
5 joined to the bottom points "D". The stent 300 is typically fabricated by laser machining of a<br>
cylindrical, stainless steel tube. However, one of skill in the art would understand that other<br>
materials may be used to fabricate the stent, including, for example, Nitinol or Cobalt-<br>
Chromium alloys.<br>
10                    A set of strut members (as shown within the dotted rectangle) form a closed,<br>
cylindrical, hoop section 306 of the stent 300, similar to hoop 106(c) of Figure 1. As described<br>
earlier, the hoop section 306 comprises a plurality of loop members 310 connected by<br>
longitudinally arranged strut members 308. The hoop section 306 can be said to consist of a<br>
multiplicity of strut elements with each strut element consisting of one loop member 310 joined<br>
15      to one strut 308.<br>
Except at the extreme ends of the stent 300, every curved loop member 310 in<br>
adjacent hoops 306 are attached to a flex link that is either an "N" flex link 314 or a "J" flex link<br>
316. A stent 300 that is thus fully connected is called a "closed cell" stent. However other<br>
open and closed cell designs are also contemplated by the present invention such that every<br>
20 curved loop member 310 may not be attached to a flex link. For example, the connections<br>
between the hoop structures 306 and the adjacent flex link 314 may be made at every loop<br>
member 310; or alternatively, at a subset of the loop members 310 around the circumference of<br>
the hoop 306. In other words, the connected loop members 310 may alternate with<br>
unconnected loop members 310 in some defined pattern around the circumference of hoop<br>
25      section 306.<br>
Figure 5 shows deployed structural cells 336 having two of the "J" flex links 316 on<br>
their perimeter, and deployed special expandable cells 334 having two of the flexible "N" flex<br>
links 314 on their perimeter. As noted above, circumferentially extending sets of cells are<br>
formed into hoop-like, circumferential cylindrical sections (hoop sections 306) with (in this case)<br>
30      exactly six cells per cylindrical segment.  Typically a multi-cell stent would have at least three<br>
7<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051 US<br>
cells per hoop section. The stent 300 illustrated in Figures 3 and 5 has exactly two cylindrical<br>
hoops (illustrated in the flat as sections 337) of structural cells 336, and four cylindrical sections<br>
335 of expandable cells 334.<br>
Another way to describe the fully connected configuration of the stent 300 is as multiple<br>
5 longitudinally spaced sets of hoop sections 306 inter-connected by either sets of flexible "N"<br>
flex links 324 or sets of flexible "J" flex links 326. Each set of "N" flex links 324 comprises<br>
multiple circumferentially spaced "N" flex links 314 with each "N" flex link 314 being connected<br>
to two curved loop members 310 of adjacent hoop sections 306. The number of "N" flex links<br>
314 in the set of "N" flex links 324 is no more than one-half of the total number of curved loop<br>
10      members 310 in the loop section 306.<br>
Similarly, each set of flexible "J" flex links 326 consists of multiple circumferentially<br>
spaced "J" flex links 316 with each "J" flex link being connected to two curved loop members<br>
310 of the hoop section 306. The number of "J" flex links 316 in the set of "J" flex links 326 is<br>
no more than one half of the total number of curved loop members 310 in the hoop section 306.<br>
15 As earlier described, Figures 3 and 5 illustrate adjacent hoop sections 306, 506 in the same<br>
circumferential orientation. That is, adjacent loop members 310, 510 on adjacent hoop<br>
sections are in axial alignment.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B show 3-dimensional, perspective views of the "N" flex link 314 and<br>
the "J" flex link 316 of the stent 300 respectively.   The "N" link 314 comprises four generally<br>
20 longitudinally extending curved segments 321(b) connected by three generally circumferentially<br>
extending segments 319(b) with each "N" flex link 314 having two ends that are attached to<br>
curved loop members 310 at attachment points 355. The "N" flex link 314 shown in Figure 4A<br>
has a strut width 315 as measured in a direction that is generally along the surface of the stent<br>
that is smaller than the wall thickness 325 as measured in a radial direction from the stent's<br>
25 longitudinal axis 328. Also illustrated in Figure 4A is the centerline length 360 of the N flex link<br>
314. The centerline length is directly proportional to flexibility of the flex link.<br>
The strut width 315 for a stent is typically less than 0.10 mm to provide good flexibility<br>
while the wall thickness 325 is typically greater than 0.10 mm to provide good stent radiopacity.<br>
Ideally the ratio of the width 315 to the thickness 325 is less than 1.0 and preferably less than<br>
8<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
0.8.  For a stent, the nominal strut width 315 would typically be 0.08 mm and the nominal wall<br>
thickness 325 is typically 0.12 mm.<br>
The combination of thin strut width 315 and thick wall thickness 325 allows the "N" flex<br>
link 314 to easily lengthen and shorten for increased stent flexibility while making the "N" flex<br>
5 link 314 relatively stiff with respect to bulging inward into the lumen of the stent 300. This<br>
stiffness enhances the ability of the "N" flex link 314 to push outward against plaque in a<br>
coronary artery after the stent 300 is deployed. In addition it was thought that the thin width 315<br>
of the "N" flex link 314 would allow the flex link 314 to stretch during stent expansion, reducing<br>
the foreshortening of the stent 300.   However, this axial flexibility contributes to the stent<br>
10     foreshortening.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4B, each "J" link 316 consists of two generally longitudinally<br>
extending curved segments 321(a) connected by a straight circumferential segment 319(a),<br>
with each "J" flex link 316 having two ends that are identically attached to curved loop members<br>
310 at attachment points 356. The "J" flex link 316 shown in Figure 4B has a strut width 317 as<br>
15 measured in a direction that is generally along the surface of the stent that is smaller than the<br>
wall thickness 326 as measured in a radial direction from the stent's longitudinal axis 328. Also<br>
illustrated in Figure 4B is the centerline length 361 of the "J" flex link 316. The centerline length<br>
is directly proportional to the flexibility of the flex link.<br>
As previously described, the stent 300 shown in Figures 3 and 5 can be said to have<br>
20 adjacent hoop sections 306 that are connected either by multiple "N" flex links 314 or by<br>
multiple "J" flex links 316. Each "N" flex link 314 is shaped so as to nest together into the<br>
adjacent "N" flex link 314 as is clearly illustrated in Figure 3. "Nesting" is defined as having the<br>
top of a first flexible link inserted beyond the bottom of a second flexible link situated just above<br>
that first flexible link.  Similarly, the bottom of the first flexible link is inserted just below the top<br>
25 of a third flexible link that is situated just below the first flexible link. Thus, a stent with nested<br>
individual flexible links has each individual flexible link nested into both adjacent flexible links;<br>
i.e., the flexible link directly below and the flexible link directly above that individual flexible link.<br>
This nesting permits crimping of the stent 300 to smaller diameters without having the "N" flex<br>
links 314 overlap.<br>

Since stents similar to stent 300 are delivered percutaneously into a body lumen, the<br>
flex links are designed to allow stent 300 to bend with relative ease as it goes around curved<br>
arteries and vessels. To provide this necessary flexibility, the "N" flex links 314 lengthen on the<br>
outside of the bent stent 300 and shorten on the inside of the bent stent 300 as the stent 300<br>
5 traverses through the lumen. This increased flexibility, while necessary to percutaneously<br>
deliver the stent 300 to its desired location, may also contribute to the foreshortening effect<br>
described earlier.<br>
While a stent is deploying (opening), the stent's flex connectors start to stretch and<br>
compensate for the foreshortening.   If this post-deployed lengthening of the flex connectors is<br>
10 not large enough (based for the most part upon balloon lengthening with increasing pressure),<br>
the flex connector expansion will not compensate for the initial foreshortening. Accordingly, in<br>
order to minimize foreshortening, a design that minimizes the axial compressibility of the flex<br>
connector, while minimizing the flex connector ultimate compressibility is desired.<br>
One   embodiment   of   the   present   invention   that   minimizes   the   axial<br>
15 compressibility of the flex links during stent deployment is illustrated in Figures 6A through 6G.<br>
Figure 6A is a perspective view of a stent 600 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The stent 600 comprises a tubular configuration of structural elements having<br>
proximal and distal open ends 602, 604 respectively, and defining a longitudinal axis 603<br>
extending there between.   As described earlier, the stent 600 has a first diameter D1 for<br>
20 insertion into a patient and navigation through a vessel, and a second diameter D2 for<br>
deployment into the target area of a vessel. The second diameter D2 is thus greater than the<br>
first diameter D1.<br>
The stent 600 structure is comprised of six (6) hoop sections 606(a) through 606(f)<br>
connected by five (5) flex links 614 sections or "sets" (i.e. 624(a) through 624(e)) extending<br>
25 between the proximal end 602 and the distal end 604. The flex links 614 connect adjacent<br>
hoops 606 together at flex link to loop connection regions 655, identified on Figure 6C. The<br>
number of flex link sets 624 is typically one less than the number of hoop sections 606.<br>
Although six (6) hoop sections 606 and five (5) flex link sections 624 are shown for the purpose<br>
of example, one of skill in the art would understand that these numbers may be greater or<br>
10<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
smaller, to allow for longer or shorter stents 600 as would typically be required by the situation<br>
presented i.e., the type and size of the vessel, or location to be supported.<br>
Figures 6B and 6C are magnified perspective views illustrating the structural element<br>
comprising stent 600 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Each hoop<br>
5 section 606(a) through 606(f) includes a plurality of longitudinally arranged strut members 608<br>
and a plurality of loop members 610 connecting adjacent struts 608. Adjacent struts 608 are<br>
connected at opposite ends in a substantially S or Z shaped pattern so as to form a plurality of<br>
cells. However, one of skill in the art would recognized that the pattern shaped by the struts is<br>
not necessarily a limiting factor in this invention, and other shaped patterns may be used. The<br>
10 plurality of loops 610 have a substantially semi-circular configuration and are substantially<br>
symmetric about their centers.<br>
Each flex link 614 comprises two generally longitudinally extending "S" shaped double<br>
curved segments 621, one on each end, connected by one generally circumferentially<br>
extending strut segment 619.    In one embodiment of the invention, the double curved S<br>
15 segment 621 comprises a first curve 622 and an opposingly oriented second curve section 623,<br>
wherein the first curve 622 is of a smaller radius than the second curve section 623. Each<br>
curved segment 621 of each flex link 614 is attached at one end to curved loop members 610<br>
on adjacent hoop sections 606 at attachment points 655 as shown. The strut segments 619<br>
are all oriented in the same direction.  That is to say, all strut segments 619 are substantially<br>
20 parallel to one another regardless of their relative position. This configuration is apparent when<br>
viewing the stent 600 in a 2-dimensional configuration.<br>
Figure 6D illustrates the stent 600 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, as it would appear if it were cut longitudinally and then laid out flat in a 2-dimensional<br>
configuration. It should be clearly understood that the stent 600 depicted in Figure 6D is in fact<br>
25 cylindrical in shape, as depicted in Figure 6A, and is only shown in the flat configuration for the<br>
purpose of illustration. This cylindrical shape would be obtained by rolling the flat configuration<br>
of Figure 6D into a cylinder with the top points "C" jointed to the bottom points "D".<br>
Stent 600 depicted in Figure 6D illustrates the relationship between hoop sections<br>
606(a) though 606(f) and flex link sets 624.  That is, the fully connected configuration of stent<br>
30      600 comprises multiple longitudinally spaced sets of hoop sections 606 interconnected by sets<br>
11<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
of flex links 624. Each set of flex links 624 comprises multiple circumferentially spaced flex<br>
links 614, with each flex link 614 in the set of flex links 624 connected to two curved loop<br>
members 610 of adjacent hoop sections 606. The number of flex links 614 in the set of flex<br>
links 624 is no more than one-half of the total number of curved loop members 610 in the loop<br>
5      sections 606.<br>
Except at the extreme ends of the stent 600, every curved loop member 610 in<br>
adjacent hoops 606 is attached to a flex link 614. As earlier described, a stent 600 that is fully<br>
connected is called a closed cell stent. However, one of skill in the art would understand that<br>
other open and closed cell designs are also contemplated by the present invention, such that<br>
10 every curved loop member 610 may not be attached to a flex link 614. For example, the<br>
connections between the hoop structures 606 and the adjacent flex link 614 may be made at<br>
every loop member 610; or alternatively, at a subset of the loop members 610 around the<br>
circumference of the hoop 606 in some defined pattern.<br>
To reduce the axial compressibility of the flex links 614, each hoop section 606 is<br>
15 circumferentially phased or offset relative to the adjacent hoop section 606. For example, hoop<br>
section 606(a) is circumferentially phased relative to hoop section 606(b), and so on. This<br>
configuration causes the flex link to loop connection regions 655 on adjacent hoop sections to<br>
be out of axial alignment, which minimizes axial compressibility.<br>
For the purpose of this invention, circumferentially phased hoop sections means that<br>
20 adjacent hoop sections are rotated or offset relative to one another about a longitudinal<br>
centerline 603 in stent 600. Figure 6B is a close-up perspective view of the stent 600<br>
illustrating the relative phase angle 631 between hoop sections 606(b) and 606(c). Reference<br>
line 632 is a longitudinal line, parallel to the stent 600 longitudinal axis 603, drawn through the<br>
apex of one particular loop member 610 on hoop 606(b).   Similarly, reference line 633 is a<br>
25 longitudinal line, parallel to the stent 600 longitudinal axis 603, drawn through the apex of the<br>
corresponding adjacent loop member 610 on hoop 606(c). The distance 630 is the<br>
circumferential offset or arc between hoop section 606(b) and 606(c). The circumferential<br>
offset corresponds to a phase angle 631 illustrated in Figure 6B.<br>
As previously disclosed, the phased hoop sections 606 result in adjacent flex link to<br>
30      loop connection regions 655 being out of axial alignment. As a result, each loop 621 of the flex<br>
12<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
link 614 can interlock with the loop 621 of the circumferentially adjacent flex link 614 when the<br>
stent 600 is nested or crimped. In addition, the interlock between loop members 621 causes<br>
direct contact between the strut members 619 from circumferentially adjacent flex links 614.<br>
This direct contact provides compressive resistance between adjacent flex links 614 in a given<br>
5 flex link set 624, and decreases the lateral distance each flex link 614 may compress during<br>
stent deployment. The end effect of this compressive resistance is a stent with a lower<br>
foreshortening during deployment. In one embodiment of the invention, foreshortening was<br>
reduced by approximately 3 percent over a similar stent without phase hoop structures.<br>
To accommodate for the circumferential phase between adjacent hoop sections 606,<br>
10 the flex connectors 614 are necessarily longer. In particular, each flex connector 614 in the<br>
illustrated embodiment has a longer circumferential strut member 619. There are several<br>
benefits of this configuration. For example, the longer circumferential strut member 619<br>
provides a larger contact area between circumferentially adjacent flex connectors 614 when the<br>
stent 600 is in the crimped configuration. The larger contact area causes greater compressive<br>
15 resistance against foreshortening, providing a stent 600 having greater axial stiffness. In<br>
addition, the longer circumferential strut 619 will have a greater tendency to bend in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the stent 600 longitudinal axis, which improves the flex connector 614<br>
flexibility, which is particularly useful when the stent is being navigated through tortuous vessel<br>
anatomies.<br>
20                    Figures 6E through 6G are partial close-up views of circumferentially adjacent flex link<br>
614 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Figure 6E illustrates the<br>
relationship between circumferentially adjacent flex links 614 when the stent 600 is in the cut,<br>
fully expanded configuration. The loop members 610 of adjacent hoop sections 606 are<br>
circumferentially phased, resulting circumferential offset distance 630. As can be seen, even<br>
25      with the offset 630, there is no interlock region when the stent 600 is fully expanded.<br>
Figure 6F illustrates the stent 600 in a partially crimped configuration. As shown, the<br>
interlock region 640 between adjacent circumferential struts 619 begins to form, due in<br>
pertinent part, to the circumferential offset between the adjacent hoop sections 606. By<br>
comparing Figures 6E and 6F, it is apparent that the interlock region 640 is closely related to<br>
30     the circumferential offset 630 between the hoop sections.  Accordingly, the greater the offset,<br>
13<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
the greater the strut 619 length, which will allow for a greater circumferential offset 640. This<br>
interlock region 640 illustrated will allow for significant foreshortening resistance even when the<br>
stent 600 is partially crimped.<br>
Figure 6G illustrates the stent 600 in the fully nested position, crimped down and<br>
5 restrained onto the delivery member. In this configuration the S sections 621 of the flex links<br>
614 fully nest in one another, providing a large interlock region 640 between adjacent<br>
circumferential struts 619. This large interlock region 640 provides a large area of physical<br>
contact between adjacent flex links 614, decreasing the lateral distance the flex link 614 may<br>
compress during stent deployment.<br>
10                    Many stents tend to twist about the longitudinal axis during stent expansion and<br>
deployment. This is particularly true for stents that have circumferentially phased hoop<br>
sections. The twisting action is caused, at least in part, by the geometry of the rotationally<br>
offset hoop sections and flex links. Each hoop section tends to rotationally displace the<br>
attached flex link during expansion.  The flex link transmits this rotational displacement to the<br>
15 adjacent hoop section attached at the opposite end of the flex link. This relative movement or<br>
rotation between stent components, although incrementally small, may have a cumulative effect<br>
depending on the stent geometry.<br>
Many times, the twist experienced by a stent is absorbed through the entire length of<br>
the stent.   However, this result may be undesirable since it could change the resultant loading<br>
20 in each stent structural member. In addition, the rotation of the stent may cause additional<br>
injury to the vessel wall.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention that reduces axial rotation or twist is<br>
illustrated in Figures 7A through 7C. The stent 700 illustrated in these Figures is very similar to<br>
the stent 600 depicted in Figures 6A through 6G, and similar reference numeral are used to<br>
25 describe similar components. However, the flex links 714 in stent 700 have an alternating<br>
geometry as will be described below. This alternating geometry provides a stent 700 with twist<br>
cancellation properties.<br>
Figure 7A is a perspective view illustrating a stent 700 having twist cancellation<br>
geometry according to one embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the stent geometry<br>
30      described above, stent 700 comprises a tubular configuration of structural elements having<br>
14<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
proximal and distal open ends 702, 704 respectively, and defining a longitudinal axis 703<br>
extending there between. The stent 700 has a first diameter D1 for insertion into a patient and<br>
navigation through a vessel, and a second diameter D2 for deployment into the target area of a<br>
vessel. The second diameter D2 is thus greater than the first diameter D1.<br>
5                    The stent 700 structure is comprised of six (6) hoop sections 706(a) through 706(f)<br>
connected by five (5) flex links 714 sections or "sets" (i.e. 724(a) through 724(e)) extending<br>
between the proximal end 702 and the distal end 704. The flex links 714 connect adjacent<br>
hoops 706 together at flex link to loop connection regions 755, identified on Figure 6B. The<br>
number of flex link sets 724 is typically one less than the number of hoop sections 706.<br>
10 Although six (6) hoop sections 706 and five (5) flex link sections 724 are shown for the purpose<br>
of example, one of skill in the art would understand that these numbers may be greater or<br>
smaller, to allow for longer or shorter stents 700 as would typically be required by the situation<br>
presented i.e., the type and size of the vessel, or location to be supported.<br>
Figure  7B   is  a   magnified  perspective  views  illustrating  the  structural  element<br>
15 comprising stent 700 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Each hoop<br>
section 706(a) through 706(f) includes a plurality of longitudinally arranged strut members 708<br>
and a plurality of loop members 710 connecting adjacent struts 708. Adjacent struts 708 are<br>
connected at opposite ends in a substantially S or Z shaped pattern so as to form a plurality of<br>
cells. However, one of skill in the art would recognized that the pattern shaped by the struts is<br>
20 not necessarily a limiting factor in this invention, and other shaped patterns may be used. The<br>
plurality of loops 710 have a substantially semi-circular configuration and are substantially<br>
symmetric about their centers.<br>
Figure 7C illustrates the stent 700 according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, as it would appear if it were cut longitudinally and then laid out flat in a 2-dimensional<br>
25 configuration. It should be clearly understood that the stent 700 depicted in Figure 7C is in fact<br>
cylindrical in shape, as depicted in Figure 7A, and is only shown in the flat configuration for the<br>
purpose of illustration. This cylindrical shape would be obtained by rolling the flat configuration<br>
of Figure 7C into a cylinder with the top points "C" jointed to the bottom points "D".<br>
Stent 700 depicted in Figure 7C illustrates the relationship between hoop sections<br>
30      706(a) though 706(f) and flex link sets 724 (i.e. 724(a) - 724(e)).  That is, the fully connected<br>
15<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
configuration of stent 700 comprises multiple longitudinally spaced sets of hoop sections 706<br>
interconnected by sets of flex links 724. Adjacent sets of flex links 724 have an alternating<br>
geometry as will be further described. Each set of flex links 724 comprises multiple<br>
circumferentially spaced flex links 714, with each flex link 714 in the set of flex links 724<br>
5      connected to two curved loop members 710 of adjacent hoop sections 706.<br>
Each flex link 714 comprises two generally longitudinally extending "S" shaped double<br>
curved segments 721, one on each end, connected by one generally circumferentially<br>
extending strut segment 719. In one embodiment of the invention, the double curved S<br>
segment 721 comprises a first curve 722 and an opposingly oriented second curve section 723,<br>
10 wherein the first curve 722 is of a smaller radius than the second curve section 723. Each<br>
curved segment 721 of each flex link 714 is attached at one end to curved loop members 710<br>
on adjacent hoop sections 706 at attachment points 755 as shown. The strut segments 719<br>
are all oriented in the same direction. That is to say, all strut segments 719 in the same flex<br>
link set 724 are substantially parallel to one another regardless of their relative position.<br>
15 However, to provide twist cancellation properties, the flex links 714 in adjacent flex link sets 724<br>
have an opposite orientation.<br>
The alternating flex link 714 geometry can best be understood by reference to Figure<br>
7C. As described earlier, adjacent sets 724 of flex links 714 have an alternating geometry. By<br>
way of example, the flex link 714 geometry in flex link set 724(d) is distal facing. That is to say,<br>
20 the flex link 714 circumferential strut 719 is distal (forward) facing. Conversely, the flex link 714<br>
circumferential strut 719 in adjacent flex link set 724(e) is proximal (rearward) facing.<br>
Disregarding the circumferential off-set or phase between the adjacent hoop sections 706(d)<br>
and 706(e), the adjacent sets of flex links 724 can be described as mirror images of one<br>
another.<br>
25                    The combination of phase shift (off-set) between adjacent hoop structures 706, and the<br>
alternating orientation of the flex link sets 724 provide added benefit over known prior art<br>
stents. As described above, the phased hoop structures 706 provide greater resistance to axial<br>
compression and foreshortening during stent deployment. In addition, alternating the flex link<br>
714 geometry allows the stent 700 structural elements to remain in the same axial plane during<br>
30      deployment.  That is, there is little or no relative movement between adjacent hoop structures<br>
16<br><br>
Docket No: CRD-5159WOPCT<br>
Express Mail Label No: EV546120051US<br>
706 during expansion.   The alternating flex link 714 geometry effectively counters or cancels<br>
the forces attempting to rotate the hoop structures 706.     For example, during stent 700<br>
expansion, each distal facing flex link 714 will tend to rotate the immediately distal hoop<br>
structure 706 counterclockwise.  Similarly each proximal facing flex link 714 will tend to rotate<br>
5      the immediately distal hoop structure clockwise.   This relative motion effectively cancels the<br>
twist experienced by the hoop structure 706, and provides no relative movement between<br>
components in the same axial alignment.<br>
While a number of variations of the invention have been shown and described in detail,<br>
other modifications and methods of use contemplated within the scope of this invention will be<br>
10      readily apparent to those of skill in the art based upon this disclosure.   It is contemplated that<br>
various combinations or sub combinations of the specific embodiments may be made and still<br>
fall within the scope of the invention.<br>
