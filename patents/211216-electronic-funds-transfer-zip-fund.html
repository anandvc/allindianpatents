				<td>ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS-ZIPFUND This invention relates to functionality, performance and provision of secure, controlled, and reliable transaction of funds using Internet facilities as well as other commercial and/or industrial online data transfers facility. <br><br>
The present e-commerce environment and systems do not give people the confidence in shopping online. People are concerned about security issues when using their credit cards/debit cards to make purchases. They are worried that by using their credit cards/debit cards to make purchases online it will compromise the security of their credit cards/debit cards for frauds. Should such information go to the wrong hands they may or could be accountable for financial implications. <br><br>
This invention continues this process but adds security in the transaction to ensure fraud is eliminated. <br><br>
The system in place also enables the usage of other financial accounts including credit card and debit card for secure electronic fund transfers for the purpose of e-commerce via business-to-consumer and/or business-to-business applications. <br><br>
Such facilities include moving funds from one financial account to another within one and/or more financial institutions via internal and/or external data transfer facilities through the usage of electronic communications networks. <br><br>
In addition to the use of credit card/debit card facility, this invention enables the use of all exiting financial accounts for online trading and/or transaction. <br><br>
This invention also introduces a new online financial account known as an Internet Financial Account. An Internet Financial Account (hereafter known as IFA) is available either as a credit account or a charge account. <br><br>
The electronic fund transfers-ZIPFUND (hereafter known as ZIPFUND) is an invention that eliminates such security implications. <br><br>
ZIPFUND generates its own transaction number that has a unique identifier that tracks a user identity. This includes a user account details and transaction number. <br><br>
ZIPFUND checks its database for user details to ensure validity of the user. User will not be permitted to use ZIPFUND if he or she is found to be not a valid user. <br><br>
ZIPFUND allocates financial transactions in an orderly process such that each transaction is unique. A transaction can only be processed when sufficient fund is available in a user account. <br><br>
ZIPFUND allocates financial transactions through user engagements. This includes a user is able to determine the amount of funds in a financial transaction. <br><br>
A transaction will only be complete if a user has sufficient funds in his or her account. This provides a user absolute control over his or her transaction as each transaction is for each purchase and each purchase is for a sum total on a financial transaction. <br><br>
ZIPFUND completes a full transaction when a merchant accepts the user transaction through an allocated ZIPFUND transaction identifier. This is processed via the Internet using e-commerce facility. <br><br>
ZIPFUND validates sufficient funds with links to financial institutions, credit cards/debit cards accounts, and its own financial database system. <br><br>
ZIPFUND prevents merchants from using unauthorised credit card/debit card transaction when such information has been given to a merchant from an earlier purchase or transaction. <br><br>
ZIPFUND has its own security encryption and decryption system to check and process each transaction. <br><br>
ZIPFUND validates sufficient funds availability of each user through its database and links with financial institutions to ensure a valid transaction. <br><br>
ZIPFUND vets both users and merchants to ensure secure financial transactions. <br><br>
ZIPFUND works with proven financial institutions systems. This is processed via system interface links, common system interface platforms and system portability. <br><br>
A user (4) of ZIPFUND accesses this facility via an Internet connection. All users of ZIPFUND must have an account with ZIPFUND to use the facility. The account shall be specific to a registered user. <br><br>
All information pertaining to the use of ZIPFUND is held in confidence and in compliance with the Privacy Act and Laws relating. <br><br>
A user may at his or her discretion choose to obtain an Internet Financial Account (IFA) with ZIPFUND. ZIPFUND will only issue an IFA to approved clients. <br><br>
An E-commerce Merchant (3) is a person or persons or an entity or entities who use an Internet site to do business with Internet clients. E-commerce Merchants must be registered with ZIPFUND to use the facility. This ensures that the E-commerce Merchant site is a secure site and Internet clients are aware of the certification. <br><br>
E-commerce Merchants are required to obtain ZIPFUND transaction identifier from Internet clients prior to confirm payments. These ZIPFUND transaction identifiers need to be confirmed by ZIPFUND in order to secure payments from financial institutions. ZIPFUND has a database of all approved E-commerce Merchants. <br><br>
A Financial Institution (1) is an entity that provides an approved level of funds that an Internet user (client) and/or an E-Commerce Merchant have with them. <br><br>
For the case of Internet users such funds can be a credit account via his or her credit card account. With ZIPFUND functions, such funds are also available to all existing account type, for example cheque account, savings account, or an IFA. <br><br>
E-commerce Merchants need to have an account with financial institutions in order to process their payments to a financial institution. With ZIPFUND functions, ZIPFUND is responsible to transact all payment transactions to a nominated financial institution. <br><br>
Financial Institutions need to provide ZIPFUND an access to a client's financial information that includes approved funds availability. This enables ZIPFUND to confirm an Internet user's financial standing. <br><br>
The issuing of an IFA to a consumer is an understanding between ZIPFUND and financial institutions. <br><br>
ZIPFUND (2) is responsible for services with Internet Users, E-commerce Merchants and Financial Institutions. <br><br>
ZIPFUND is responsible to provide E-commerce Merchants an approved transaction number to the ZIPFUND transaction identifier (s) sent by them via a secure network. ZIPFUND is responsible to provide Financial Institutions an approved transaction number to each ZIPFUND transaction identifier (s) sent by E-commerce Merchants via a secure network. <br><br>
ZIPFUND has the capability not to use original credit card and/or debit card account number for transaction processing. Instead ZIPFUND generates new IFA number or ZIPFUND's own credit card/debit card account number with reference to original credit card/debit card number. <br><br>
ZIPFUND is responsible to ensure absolute security for Internet Users to carry out their business-to-consumer transactions. This is possible through ZIPFUND's proprietary software, accounting systems, process flow, system design and methodology, data definition and special control process which is proprietary information. <br><br>
Figure 2 (5) shows the start of a transaction process. <br><br>
Internet User or consumer (6) is the same as item (4) of Figure 1. Internet User (1) access to ZIPFUND (2) via the Internet. There are security process such as network security access controls and user profile password checks before access to ZIPFUND (2) is approved. The Internet User (1) had earlier registered to be a ZIP account holder. <br><br>
The Internet User (1) requests for transaction identifier (s) for his/her online shopping needs. This is shown as (7) in Figure 2. <br><br>
ZIPFUND (2) checks Internet User (6) to ensure he/she is a valid user. This is shown as (8) in Figure 2. <br><br>
ZIPFUND (2) confirms validation process shown as (9) on Figure 2. <br><br>
The decision process is shown as (10) on Figure 2. If the Internet User (1) is confirmed as a valid user, the task is passed on shown as (11) on Figure 2. <br><br>
Otherwise, the Interne User (6) is rejected from ZIPFUND (2). <br><br>
Assuming that Internet User (6) is confirmed as a valid user he/she is preceded to task (11). This task is when ZIPFUND (2) issues transaction identifier (s) as requested by the Interne User (6). <br><br>
Internet User (6) then select item in E-Commerce Merchant's Site. This task is shown as (11) on Figure 2. <br><br>
Once Interne User (6) decided on the item (s) he/she issued transaction identifier (s) to the E-Commerce Merchant. This task is shown as (13) on Figure 2. <br><br>
E-Commerce Merchant (3) validates the transaction identifier (s) with ZIPFUND (2). <br><br>
This task is shown as (14) on Figure 2. <br><br>
ZIPFUND (2) confirms validity of transaction identifier (s) from E-Commerce Merchant (3). This task is shown as (15) on Figure 2. There are security process such as network security access controls and merchant profile'password'checks before access to ZIPFUND (2) is approved. <br><br>
The decision process is shown as (16) on Figure 2. If the transaction identifiers are confirmed as valid, the task is passed on shown as (17) on Figure 2. <br><br>
ZIPFUND (2) issues approved transaction number to E-commerce Merchant (3). <br><br>
This informs the E-Commerce Merchant that his/her transaction identifiers are accepted. If the transaction identifiers were rejected, task (16) will advise E-commerce Merchant of his rejection and reason (s) for it. <br><br>
Assuming that the transaction identifiers were accepted, ZIPFUND issues to E-commerce Merchant's (3) account at his/her Financial Institution (1) the credit amount due. This task is shown as (18) on Figure 2. There are security process such as network security access controls and ZIPFUND profile'password'checks before access to Financial Institution (1) is approved. <br><br>
Figure 2 (19) shows the end of a transaction process. <br><br>
Figure 3 item (20) shows the under-layer of ZIPFUND system architecture. <br><br>
Generally this is where the operating system resides. <br><br>
The next level is the Relational Database Management System (21). This is the data collection centre of the system. <br><br>
The Relational Database N anagemert System (21) interacts with the Application System (22). The Applicatic n System interacts with Interne Base System (23) that links ZIPFUND (2) to the rest of the world. <br><br>
Figure 4 item (24) shows hternet User Profile. The Internet User Profile (24) is a repository of information concerning a particular Interne User (4) on Figure 1. This is used for validation with Financial Institution Profile shown as item (25). <br><br>
Figure 4 item (26) shows E-commerce Merchant Profile. The E-Commerce Merchant Profile (26) is a repository of information concerning a particular E- Commerce Merchant (3) on Figure 1. This is used for validation with Financial Institution Profile shown as item (27). It is accepted that the Profile for E- Commerce Merchant (3) is different from Interne User (4) Figure 5 shows the data validation structure (process). All activities are tracked and logged onto an audit trail in ZIPFUND (2). <br><br>
