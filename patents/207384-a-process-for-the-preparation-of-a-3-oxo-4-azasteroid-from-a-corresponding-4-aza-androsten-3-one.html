"A   PROCESS   FOR   THE   PREPARATION   OF  A   3-0X0-4-AZASTER0ID   FROM   A   CORRESPONDS<br>
4-AZA-AHDR0STEN-3-0NE"<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improvement in a process for the preparation of steroids. More particularly, the invention is concerned with improvements in a process tor preparing steroids, such.as 3-oxo-4-azasteroids, by hydrogenation of the corresponding steroid alkene. Compounds of this type are known to be useful in the preparation of compounds having 5a-reductase inhibitor activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Steroid 5 -reductases catalyze conversion of testosterone to DHT in an NADPH dependent fashion as shown in Scheme A.<br><br>
The inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to DHT is anticipated to be useful in the treatment of a variety of androgen responsive diseases, e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, acne, male pattern baldness and hirsutism. Hence, 5 -reductase inhibitors have been the subject of active research worldwide. For example, see: Hsia, S. and Voight, W., J, Invest Derm., 62, 224 (1973); Robaire, B. et a/. J. Steroid Biochem,, 8, 307 (1977); Petrow, V, et al, Steroids, 38, 121 (1981); Liang, T". et a/., J. Steroid Biochem., 19, 385 (1983); Holt, D, et a/., J. Med. Chem., 33, 937 (1990); U.S. Patent No. 4,377,584, U.S. Patent-No. 4,760,071 and U.S. Patent No. 5,017,568.    One<br><br>
2<br>
particularly promising 5 -reductase inhibitor is MK-906 (Merck), known by the generic name, finasteride, and marketed under the trademark, Proscar, is an inhibitor of type 2 5 -reductase. In addition, dual inhibitors of type 1 and 2 human 5 -reductase are disciosed in WO 95/07926 and WO 95/07927. the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Processes for the preparation of the 5 -reductase inhibitors are described in WO 95/07926, WO 95/07927, US 4,760,071, US 4,377,584, US 4,179,453, US 5,670,643 and Bhattacharya, A. et a/., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 110, 3318 (1988). Important intermediates in the preparation of 5 -reductase inhibitors are 4-aza-5a-androstan-3-ones, e.g. 3oxo-4-azaandrost-17P-carboxy]ic_acid,..which can be prepared by hydrogenation of the corresponding 4-aza-androst-5-en-3-one, e.g. l3-bxo-4-azaandrost-5-en-17p-carboxylic acid. WO 95/07926 and WO95/0792/Udescribe a process by which.a.17p-substituted 4-aza-androst-5-en-3-one is converted to the corresponding 17p-substituted 4-aza-5 -androstan-3-one-by hydrogenation. For example, the hydrogenation may be carried out in acetic acid at 60_to 70Â°C and 276-414 kPa (40-60 psi) hydrogen pressure in the presence of catalytic platinum oxide.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is the provision of a superior, and more selective process for the hvdroqenation of steroid alkenes.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Scheme 1 shows the hydrogenation of a steroid, 3-oxo-4-azaandrost-5-en-17p-carboxylic acid, to the corresponding 5 -androstane and 5 -androstane isomers. 5a-androstane isomer produced using the reaction can be used in the preparation or 5 -reductase inhibrtors. For large scaie manufacture, a hydrogenation process which could be carried out at atmospheric pressure was desired. However, as demonstrated by the experiments below, considerable problems relating to <p ratios were experienced when hydrogenation was carried out at atmospheric pressure.></p>
 <br>
3<br><br>
The present inventors have found a process for hvdroaenating steroid alkenes which can be performed at atmospheric pressure. The problem of low  :  ratios was solved by carrying out the hydrogenation in the presence of ammonium acetate, ammonium formate or ammonium propionate.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for hvdroqenatinq steroid alkenes comprising the step of hydrogenating one or more double bonds in.the presence of ammonium acetate, ammonium formate, ammonium propionate, or mixtures thereof and an appropriate catalyst.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is the use of the process of the invention in the preparation of a 5 -reductase inhibitor.<br>

Water (25 S) was used as a line wash following the addition.   The mixture was heated at reflux (75-80Â°C) for about 1 hour.   The<br><br>
11<br>
mixture was cooled, and acetic acid (135 I) added while the contents were further cooled. The mixture was filtered, and the filter cake washed with tert-butanol (130 I) and acetic acid (135 I).

The mixture was stirred for at least 2 hours. The product was isolated by filtration, washed with water and dried at up to 55Â°C under vacuum with a nitrogen purge. Weight range: 45-51 kg (85-95% theory, 83-93% w/w).<br>
Stage 3: 4-aza-5a-androstan-3-one-17p-carboxyHc acid (3).<br>
Typical scale 33.5 kg<br>
The hydrogenation vessel was charged with acetic acid (530 I), 3-oxo-4-aza-5-androstene-17p-carboxylic acid 2 (33.5 kg.), and ammonium acetate (1.0 kg, 0.1 eq.)- After purging at 20-25Â°C with nitrogen, the platinum oxide catalyst (3.0 kg.) was charged, the stirrer started and the temperature adjusted to 20-25Â°C. After purging with hydrogen, the stirring batch was allowed to take up hydrogen. After 30 minutes at 
 <br>

Stage 4: 4-aza-5a-androst-1-ene-3-one-17p-carboxylic (4). Typical scale 20.0 kg<br>
The reaction vessel was charged with dioxane (180 I), 4-aza-5a-androstan-3-<br>
one-17 -carboxylic acid 3 (20.0 kg, 1 eq.) and 2,3-dichIoro-5,6-<br>
dicyanobenzoquinone	(DDQ)	(15.6	kg,	1.1	eq.).<br>
Bis(trimethylsily!)trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) (78 I, 4.7 eq.) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux and maintained at reflux for 2-4 hours. The mixture was cooled to 
Stage 5: (5a,17p)-N-[2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-oxo-4-azaandrost-1-ene-17-carboxamide (5).<br>

 <br>
13<br>
solids were removed by filtration and washed with ethyl acetate (270 I). The combined filtrate/wash was extracted four times with 10% potassium hydroxide (57 I each). The organic solution was washed with 1N hydrochloric acid (57 I) and water (57 I). The resulting solution was concentrated in vacuo at 
 <br><br>

EXAMPLE 2: Influence of ammonium acetate on the hydrogenation of 3-oxo-4azaandrost-5-ene-17 -carboxvlic acid<br>
The   hydrogenation   vessel   was   charged   with   HOAc   (16   vol.),   3-oxo-4-<br>
azaandrost-5-ene-17 -carboxylic acid (1 wt), and NH4OAc (0.025 wt), while<br>
maintaining the temperature at 20-25Â°C.   The system was purged three times<br>
with  N2.    The PtO2 (0.12 wt) was charged, stirring was initiated and the<br>
temperature was adjusted to 20-25Â°C. The vessel was again purged three times<br>
with N2; following the third purge, stirring was stopped and the vessel purged<br>
three times with H2- Stirring was resumed and the batch allowed to take up<br>
hydrogen. The temperature was maintained at 20-25Â°C for the first 30 minutes,<br>
adjusted to 60-65Â°C over 30 minutes, and maintained until the reaction was<br>
complete.   Following reaction completion, stirring was stopped and the vessel<br>
was purged three times with N2.  Solka Floe (0.05 wt) was charged and stirring<br>
was resumed.   The hot reaction mixture was recirculated through a GAF filter<br>
until the solution was clear and the hot reaction filtrate was then transferred to a<br>
clean vessel. The reaction vessel was charged with HOAc (3 vol.), heated to 60-<br>
65Â°C and stirred for at least 5 minutes.  The hot rinse was filtered through the<br>
GAF filter and combined with the reaction filtrate. Volume was reduced in vacuo<br>
to 3.6 volumes and the resulting slurry was cooled to 20-25Â°C.  Methanol (4 vol)<br>
was added to the slurry and the mixture was "aged" to obtain a more filterable<br>
particle for 2-24 hours at 20-25Â°C.   The product was isolated by filtration and<br><br>
15<br>
washed with methanol (1.5 vol). The resulting solid was dried on the filter for at least 30 minutes, then dried in vacuo at 50-60 Â°C for 12-18 hours.<br>
Results<br>
Following successful campaigns using 276-345 kPa (40-50 psi) H2 pressure, where a:p ratios had been &gt;9:1, manufacturing constraints necessitated additional investigations at atmospheric H2 pressure. Unfortunately, atmospheric hydrogenation resulted in a:p ratios of 10:1 (Table 1). Contrary to literature precedent, ammonium chloride was not effective. Also ineffective were ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, and sodium acetate. Tetramethylethylenediammonium (TMEDA) acetate, was effective at improving the  :  ratio, but significantly retarded the hydrogenation.<br>
The results of a pilot study at 0%, 2.5% and 10% NH4OAc loads are shown in Table 2. Atmospheric hydrogenation at 2.5 w/w% NH4OAc load was successfully applied to batches of &gt;30 kg input each (Table 3), supplying 83-85% isolated yields of 3-oxo-4-aza-5aandrostane (2) of &gt;99% purity.<br><br><br><br>
