				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR DATA PACKET<br>
TRANSMISSION ON A NETWORK<br>
Technical Field<br>
|0001|	This invention relates generally to a technique for data packet<br>
transmission on a network.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Currently, mobile-Internet Protocol ("IP") and Session Initiation<br>
Protocol ("SIP") moves all mobile-IP sessions and SIP application sessions,<br>
respectively, during handovers. Under these schemes, however, these sessions<br>
cannot be separated even if it may be logical or efficient to do. For example,<br>
there may be circumstances where only the video data need to be transmitted<br>
and/or the audio data may be sent to a different device. Moreover, given the<br>
complexity of current cellular sessions, there may also be other active sessions<br>
that do not need to be sent to the new device. Specifically, a cell phone having a<br>
multimedia session active may not necessarily want to move the Multimedia<br>
Messaging Service ("MMS"), Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service<br>
("MBMS"), and other sessions, but rather, only the multimedia session should be<br>
moved. This inflexibility also cannot appropriately accommodate a multimodc<br>
terminal handing over from a home wireless local area network ("WLAN") to an<br>
external access network, since most homes with broadband have an internal<br>
Network Address Translation ("NAT") that makes all of the devices in the home<br>
appear to have a single Internet Protocol address (e.g., device). Because devices,<br>
such as printer, are not typically leaving the home, it will appear as though a<br>
portion of the Internet Protocol space is moving when a multimode terminal<br>
changes its access networks. As described, these current systems provide data<br>
packet transmissions that are inflexible and inefficient and cannot effectively<br>
accommodate the flexible demands of current various networks.<br>

embodiments of the present invention.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
[0010]	Generally speaking, pursuant to these various embodiments, a<br>
change in a client device is detected during a transmission of a plurality of packets<br>
destined to at least one first destination used by at least one packet session. In one<br>
specific embodiment, the change in the client device is detected with a receipt of<br>
an indication of the change from the client device. In response to the change, a<br>
determination is made as to whether some but not all of the plurality of packets<br>
should be redirected to at least one second destination based, at least in part, on at<br>
least one predefined criterion. Accordingly, the some but not all of the plurality<br><br>
of packets is redirected to the at least one second destination when some but not<br>
all of the plurality of packets should be redirected according to the at least one<br>
predefined criterion. For particular embodiments, the redirection of these packets<br>
can be done by substituting the first destination with the second destination.<br>
tunneling the packets with the second destination, and/or duplicating the packets<br>
using the second destination.<br>
[00111	In specific embodiments, substantially all of the plurality of<br>
packets destined to the at least one first destination used by the at least one packet<br>
session are received, and the remaining plurality of packets that are not the<br>
portions being redirected to the second destination is redirected to the first<br>
destination. In other embodiments, an assessment of the portions of the plurality<br>
of packets that should be redirected is made based, at least in part, on at least one<br>
predefined parameter. According to various embodiments, the at least one<br>
predefined parameter may be, but is not limited to, at least one source Internet<br>
Protocol address, at least one source port identifier, at least one destination port<br>
identifier, a session indicator, a flow indicator, a transport protocol type, and a<br>
transport protocol session.<br>
[0012]	For one embodiment, the at least one second destination is selected<br>
based, at least in part, on a predefined parameter, such as, but not limited to, the<br>
second destination being provided by the client device, the second destination<br>
being provided by another client device, the second destination being provided by<br>
a network infrastructure, a detection of the second destination assigned to another<br>
client device, an assignment of the second destination as the location of the client<br>
device changes, and a request of a media conversion device.<br>
[0013]	According to various embodiments, a change in a client device is<br>
detected during a transmission of a plurality of packets that are destined to at least<br>
one first destination used by at least one packet session. In response to detecting<br>
the change in the client device, substantially all of the plurality of packets are<br>
redirected to a network element that redirects some but not all of the plurality of<br>
packets to at least one second destination based, at least in part, on at least one<br>
predefined criterion.<br>
[0014]	According to various embodiments, a change in a client device is<br><br>
detected during a transmission of a plurality of packets destined to at least one<br>
first destination used by at least one packet session. Accordingly, an indication of<br>
the change is sent to a network element that redirects some but not all of the<br>
plurality of packets to at least one second destination based, at least in part. on at<br>
least one predefined criterion.<br>
[0015]	In various embodiments, the predefined criterion includes<br>
movement of the client device, movement of a device served by the client device<br>
out of the first destination, an instruction by a user of the client device, a<br>
connection of the client device to a new access network, loss of at least a portion<br>
of the communication links, a detection of proximity of an alternative terminal,<br>
change in client device usage of the at least one packet session, a transfer of<br>
sessions between the client device and another client device, a more suitable<br>
client device, a more suitable display, a more suitable audio device, and/or a<br>
reduction of power consumption. Moreover, the first destination may include at<br>
least one Internet Protocol address, at least one label, at least one port, at least one<br>
flow identifier, at least one virtual circuit, and/or at least one frame header. The<br>
second destination, however, may include at least one Internet Protocol address, at<br>
least one label, at least one port, at least one flow identifier, at least one virtual<br>
circuit, at least one frame header, an analog input, an analog output, a digital<br>
input, and/or a digital output.<br>
[0016]	Through the various embodiments, an improved technique for data<br>
packet transmission has been provided that, among other things, better<br>
accommodates the complexity of current packet sessions. In particular, different<br>
flows and sessions are differentiated to provide a more logical and efficient<br>
allocation of these data packets to the network addresses, resulting in a better<br>
usage of the network addresses that service these data packets. Aside from<br>
providing an improved partial Internet Protocol handover in a cellular network,<br>
the various teachings also work well with a multimode terminal handing over<br>
from a home WLAN to an external access network. For example, a video<br>
streaming on a handheld device can be automatically transferred to a monitor<br>
device when the user gets into the proximity of the monitor device in the home.<br>
Multiple user and/or network allocation improvements arc provided through the<br><br>
various teachings described.<br>
[0017|	As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are<br>
disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments<br>
arc merely exemplary of the invention, which can be embodied in various forms.<br>
Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be<br>
interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative<br>
basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention<br>
in virtually any appropriately detailed structure. Further, the terms and phrases<br>
used herein are not intended to be limiting; but rather, to provide an<br>
understandable description of the invention.<br>
[0018]	The terms "a" or "an," as used herein, are defined as one or more<br>
than one. The term "plurality," as used herein, is defined as two or more than<br>
two. The term "another," as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more.<br>
The terms "including" and/or "having," as used herein, are defined as comprising<br>
(i.e., open language). The term "coupled," as used herein, is defined as<br>
connected, although not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically.<br>
The terms "program," "software application," and the like as used herein, are<br>
defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a computer<br>
system. A program, computer program, or software application may include a<br>
subroutine, a function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation,<br>
an executable application, an applet, a servlet, a source code, an object code, a<br>
shared library/dynamic load library and/or other sequence of instructions designed<br>
for execution on a computer system.<br>
[0019]	Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to FIG. 1, for<br>
purposes of providing an illustrative but nonexhaustive example to facilitate this<br>
description, a specific operational paradigm using a communication system is<br>
shown and indicated generally at 100. Those skilled in the art, however, will<br>
recognize and appreciate that the specifics of this illustrative example are not<br>
exhaustive of the invention and that the teachings set forth herein are applicable in<br>
a variety of alternative settings. For example, since the various teachings are not<br>
platform dependent, they can be applied to broadcast and multimedia initiatives in<br>
a 3GPP or a 3GPP2 system. Any digital broadcast services or digital satellite<br><br>
services are also applicable. In fact, a wired network implementation may also be<br>
desired if it experiences data packet transmission. As such, the various teachings<br>
described can be implemented in any network that transmits data packets as part<br>
of the normal operation of the network. Thus, these various platform and network<br>
implementations arc within the scope of the invention, and various embodiments<br>
for these multiple implementations are readily understood and appreciated by one<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
[0020]	Pursuant to this example, using a network element 102, a client<br>
device 104 with its own Transmission Control Protocol ("TCP") receiver 106 is<br>
linked to a TCP transmitter 108 over the Internet 110. In particular, the client<br>
device 104 may be transmitting or receiving data packets on a first destination<br>
112 via a server 114. Depending upon the predefined criterion, the network<br>
element 102, specifically the server 114 in this embodiment shown, may detect a<br>
change in the client device 104 and redirect some but not all of the data packets to<br>
a second destination 116 that may be better suited for the data packet transmission<br>
of the client device 104. Depending upon the configuration of the network,<br>
multiple ways to redirect some but not all of the data packets are contemplated,<br>
such as substituting the first destination with the second destination, tunneling the<br>
redirected packets with the second destination, and/or duplicating the redirected<br>
packets using the second destination.<br>
[0021]	One embodiment works especially well for existing home agents<br>
or servers that cannot be altered to redirect packets. To integrate various<br>
embodiments of the invention with minimal alternation to the current system, the<br>
existing home agents and/or servers are adapted to send substantially all of the<br>
data packets to a network element that then redirects the data packets.<br>
Specifically, in this embodiment, substantially all of the plurality of packets<br>
destined for the first destination are received and some but not all of these packets<br>
are accordingly redirected to the second destination based, at least in part, on at<br>
least one predefined criterion. In an embodiment, a remaining plurality of packets<br>
that are not the portions being redirected to the second destination are redirected<br>
to the first destination (with those skilled in the art understanding that this latter<br>
"redirection" is a redirection with respect to the packets having been first directed<br><br>
to this network element and now being directed to the first destination<br>
notwithstanding that these packets were originally targeted to that first<br>
destination).<br>
[0022)	Moreover, for various embodiments, an assessmen of the plurality<br>
of data packets that should be redirected is made based, at least in part, on at least<br>
one predefined parameter, such as, but not limited to, at least one source Internet<br>
Protocol address, at least one source port identifier, at least one destination port<br>
identifier, a session indicator, a flow indicator, a transport protocol type, and/or a<br>
transport protocol session. The second destination may also be selected based, at<br>
least in part, on a predefined parameter, such as the second destination being<br>
provided by the client device, the second destination being provided by another<br>
client device, the second destination being provided by a network infrastructure, a<br>
detection of the second destination assigned to another client device, an<br>
assignment of the second destination as the location of the client device changes,<br>
and a request of a media conversion device. According to one embodiment, a<br>
change is detected in a client device during a transmission of a plurality of packets<br>
destined to at least one first destination used by at least one packet session, and in<br>
response, an indication of the change is sent to the network element that redirects<br>
some but not all of the plurality of packets to at least one second destination<br>
based, at least in part, on at least one predefined criterion.<br>
[0023]	Referring to FIG. 2, a client device 200 suitable for various<br>
embodiments is shown. For simplicity and clarity, it should be noted that FIG. 2<br>
does not include all the hardware components needed in a typical client device,<br>
which are commonly included and known in the art. Moreover, as a skilled<br>
artisan readily appreciates, other hardware configurations and circuitry topology<br>
layouts, although not shown, can be used to implement the various teachings<br>
described. As such, the client device 200 shown in FIG. 2 is provided as a<br>
practical example to implement the teachings of the various embodiments. As<br>
such, the client device 200 refers to any device that can transmit data packets,<br>
which includes, but is not limited to, cell phones, personal digital assistants,<br>
and/or computers. Moreover, "circuit" refers to one or more component devices<br>
such as, but not limited to, processors, memory devices, application specific<br><br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), and/or firmware, which are created to implement or<br>
adapted to implement (perhaps through the use of software) certain functionality,<br>
all within the scope of the various teachings described.<br>
	In this exemplary client devicc  shown  a controller circuit 202 is<br>
included to detect a change in a client device during a transmission of a plurality<br>
of packets destined to at least one first destination used by at least one packet<br>
session. Operably coupled to the controller circuit 202, a transceiver circuit 204<br>
is included to send an indication of the change to a network element that<br>
ultimately redirects some but not all of the plurality of packets to at least one<br>
second destination based, at least in part, on at least one predefined criterion.<br>
[002S|	In various embodiments, the predefined criterion includes<br>
movement of the client device, movement of a device served by the client device<br>
out of the first destination, an instruction by a user of the client device, a<br>
connection of the client device to a new access network, loss of at least a portion<br>
of the communication links, a detection of proximity of an alternative terminal, a<br>
change in client device usage of the at least one packet session, transfer sessions<br>
between the client device and another client device, a more suitable client device,<br>
a more suitable display, a more suitable audio device, and/or a reduction of power<br>
consumption. Moreover, the first destination may include at least one Internet<br>
Protocol address, at least one label, at least one port, at least one flow identifier, at<br>
least one virtual circuit, and/or at least one frame header. The second destination,<br>
however, may include at least one Internet Protocol address, at least one label, at<br>
least one port, at least one flow identifier, at least one virtual circuit, at least one<br>
frame header, an analog input, an analog output, a digital input, and/or a digital<br>
output.<br>
[0026]	As typically provided in a mobile station, an input circuit 206, such<br>
as a input buffer, is included to provide input data. An output circuit 208, such as<br>
an antenna, is included to provide data transmission to the infrastructure, such as<br>
the base stations. A user interface 210 is also included to obtain user inputs, and a<br>
memory circuit 212 is used to provide memory to either temporarily or<br>
permanently store information.<br>
[0027]	Turning now to FIG. 3, a flow chart diagram of a redirect process<br><br>
according to an embodiment of the invention is shown and indicated generally at<br>
numeral reference 300. Although the process shown is preferably implemented at<br>
the network element 102, there may be other implementations of each of the<br>
processes shown that are better for other components in the infrastructure in the<br>
communication system. These processes shown, thus, can be implemented fully<br>
or partially at any of the components within the system. Moreover, as one skilled<br>
in the art can readily appreciate, any of the processes shown can be altered in<br>
multiple ways to achieve the same functions and results of the various teachings<br>
described. As a result, these processes shown are one exemplary embodiment of<br>
multiple variation embodiments that may not be specifically shown. Thus, the<br>
processes shown are directed to the system, and each of them may be altered<br>
slightly to accommodate any of the components in the communications system.<br>
These other embodiments, however, are within the scope of the various teachings<br>
described.<br>
[0028|	In light of this, the redirect process 300 starts by optionally<br>
receiving 304 substantially all of the plurality of data packets that are destined for<br>
the first destination used by the at least one packet session. According to one<br>
embodiment, the receipt of all of these data packets provides an indication for<br>
detecting 306 a change in a client device during a transmission of the plurality of<br>
packets destined to the first destination. Other detections of the change are<br>
contemplated. For example, the detected change can be obtained also through a<br>
receipt of an indication of the change from the client device, itself. Alternatively,<br>
the change in the client device can also be tracked by the network infrastructure,<br>
such as the client device being moved closer to the second destination that can<br>
better served the client device. As such, multiple embodiments of detecting the<br>
change in the client device are contemplated and are readily appreciated by one<br>
skilled in the art, which are all within the scope of the various embodiments, even<br>
if not specifically shown.<br>
[0029]	Responsive to this change in the client device, according to this<br>
embodiment shown, an assessment 308 is made as to portions of the multiple data<br>
packets that should be redirected based, at least in part, on at least one predefined<br>
parameter, such as at least one source Internet Protocol address, at least one<br><br>
source port identifier, at least one destination port identifier, a session indicator, a<br>
flow indicator, a transport protocol type, and a transport protocol session. In<br>
various other embodiments, the second destination may also be selected 310<br>
based on multiple parameter of. for example, thc second destination being<br>
provided by the client device, another client device, the network infrastructure, a<br>
detection of the second destination assigned to another client device, an<br>
assignment of the second destination as the location of the client device changes,<br>
and/or a request of a media conversion device.<br>
[0030]	Once the portions of packets that should be redirected and/or the<br>
second destination are obtained, a determination 312 is made as to whether these<br>
portions of data packet should, in fact, be redirected to the second destination<br>
based, at least in part, on at least one predefined criterion. According to one<br>
embodiment, this predefined criterion may include, but not limited to, movement<br>
of the client device, movement of a device served by the client device out of the<br>
first destination, an instruction by a user of the client device, a connection of the<br>
client device to a new access network, loss of at least a portion of the<br>
communication links, a detection of proximity of an alternative terminal, a change<br>
in client device usage of the at least one packet session, transfer sessions between<br>
the client device and another client device, a more suitable client device, a more<br>
suitable display, a more suitable audio device, and/or a reduction of power<br>
consumption.<br>
[0031]	If, after all, the portions of the data packets should not be<br>
redirected to the second destination, the process ends 314 at this point. If,<br>
however, the portions of the data packets should be redirected, these portions of<br>
data packets are accordingly redirected 316 to the second destination. The<br>
redirecting of these portions of packets to the second destination can be done in<br>
multiple ways, such as substituting the first destination with the second<br>
destination, tunneling of the portions of the data packet with the second<br>
destination, and/or duplicating the portions of packets using the second<br>
destination. According to one embodiment, especially for the implementation<br>
where substantially all of the packets destined for the first destination has been<br>
directed to, for example, an intervening network element as suggested above, the<br><br>
remaining plurality of packets that are not being redirected to the second<br>
destination are redirected 318 to the first destination, as originally intended.  The<br>
process ends 314 at this point.<br>
|0032]	Referring now to FIG. 4. a flow chart diagram of a redirect process<br>
implemented according to an embodiment of the invention is shown and indicated<br>
generally at numeral reference 400. This particular redirect process 400, as<br>
shown, starts 402 with a detection 404 of a change in the client device during a<br>
transmission of multiple data packet destined to a first destination used by at least<br>
one packet session. In this embodiment, though, substantially all of the multiple<br>
packets are redirected 406 to a network element that, in turn, redirects some but<br>
not all of the data packets to the second destination based on the predefined<br>
criterion, which ends 408 the process at this point.<br>
[0033]	Turning now to FIG. 5, a flow chart diagram of an indication<br>
process according to an embodiment of the invention is shown and indicated<br>
generally at numeral reference 500. The indication process 500 is initiated 502,<br>
again, with a detection 504 of a change in the client device during a transmission<br>
of multiple data packets destined to the first destination used by at least one<br>
packet session. In this embodiment, responsive to this change, an indication of<br>
the change is sent 506 to a network element that subsequently redirects some but<br>
not all of the packets to the second destination based on the predefined criterion.<br>
The process ends 508 at this point.<br>
[0034]	Through the various embodiments, an improved technique for data<br>
packet transmission has been provided that, among other things, better<br>
accommodates the complexity of current packet sessions. In particular, different<br>
flows and sessions are differentiated to provide a more logical and efficient<br>
allocation of these data packets to the network addresses, resulting in a better<br>
usage of the network addresses that service these data packets. Aside from<br>
providing an improved partial Internet Protocol handover in a cellular network,<br>
the various teachings also works well with a multimode terminal handing over<br>
from a home WLAN to an external access network. For example, a video<br>
streaming on a handheld device can be automatically redirected to a monitor<br>
device when the user becomes proximal to the monitor device in the home while,<br><br>
for example, an audio stream as relates to a two-way communication can continue<br>
to be directed to and received at the handheld device. Multiple user and/or<br>
network allocation improvements are provided through the various teachings<br>
described.<br>
[0035]	Those skilled in the art will recognize that a wide variety of<br>
modifications, alterations, and combinations can be made with respect to the<br>
above described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention, and that such modifications, alterations, and combinations are to be<br>
viewed as being within the ambit of the inventive concept.<br><br>
