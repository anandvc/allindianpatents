				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a tyre comprising at least one tread joined to two beads by means of two sidewalls and a carcass reinforcement, said tyre being able to be used with or without an independent inner tube and being intended, after mounting on a standardised rim and after inflation, to be fitted on any vehicle capable of rolling.<br>
The tyres may be mounted on several types of standardised rim.  Said rims may have frustoconical seats inclined relative to the axis of rotation, forming with said axis an angle which may be between 4° and 16°.  Among the latter, there are integral rims which are then referred to as hollow rims, semi-hollow rims or even drop-centre rims, or rims made of several sections which are referred to as interim or "advanced".  The rims in question may also have rim seats parallel to the axis of rotation and are generally referred to as flat-based.<br>
The most frequently used rims, referred to as hollow or drop-centre rims, comprise a mounting groove, the diameter of which is distinctly less than the nominal diameter of the rim.  This rim groove diameter is considered by users to be too small, and it does not make it possible to select brake drums of dimensions suitable for braking effectively vehicles which are becoming more and more powerful.<br>
It is furthermore highly desirable, whatever the reasons (reducing the pressures exerted by the tyre on the ground, increasing the transverse stiffness of the tyre, increasing the available internal space of the rim, lowering the centre of gravity of certain types of machinery, to name but a few), to produce tyres, the<br><br>
H/S form ratio of which is reduced, H being the height of the tyre on its rim and S its maximum axial width.<br>
The development of tyres with reduced form ratios, more particularly .intended to be fitted on heavy vehicle-type vehicles, such as lorries, buses, subway trains and tractor-trailer units, or of the very large heavy-vehicle type, such as loading, transport and earthmoving machinery used in civil engineering, or aircraft machinery, is very delicate; in particular, the endurance of the beads becomes significantly less as the H/S ratio decreases, the inadequacies in endurance being found at the level of the ends of upturns of the carcass reinforcement or the ends of reinforcement plies located in the beads of the tyre, the structure of said beads being a conventional structure with, in each bead, a carcass reinforcement upturn and reinforcement plies, the meridian profiles of which are substantially parallel to the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the zone of said beads.  Furthermore, such form ratios, despite the possible reduction in the inflation pressures, involve a notable lack of comfort, which may be quite unbearable in the case of tyres travelling long distances on relatively bumpy roads.<br>
In order to overcome such disadvantages and to facilitate the production of tyres, Application FR 94/14688 proposes a tyre of form ratio of less than 0.8, intended to be mounted on a hollow rim or a drop-centre riin, the seats of which are inclined relative to the axis of rotation by an angle which may be between 4° and 16".  Said tyre has a carcass reinforcement, surmounted radially by a crown reinforcement, the carcass reinforcement being composed of at least one ply of cords or cables and being turned up in each bead about an anchoring bead wire, passing from the outside<br><br>
to the inside to form an upturn, said upturn being reinforced by at least one additional reinforcement ply of metal cables, oriented by an angle of between 0" and 20° relative to the circumferential direction, the value 0° being included in said range, and the meridian profile of said reinforced upturn, in the tyre not mounted on its rim, being substantially parallel to the meridian profile of at least the portion of the seat located axialLy to the inside of the projection of the centre of the circle circumscribed on the bead wire on said rim seat::.<br>
Although the production methods of a tyre are currently very highly developed, the use of bead wires requires separate production and treatment of said bead wires (coating, for example), the transport and positioning of the same bead wires on a building drum or on a given support for manufacture of the bead, all operations which require time and multiple precautions, and which are therefore costly.  Furthermore, since the current tyres are subjected to ever-increasing driving torques, the compromise between clamping on the rim which is necessary to civoid inopportune rotations and maximum clamping to permit mounting on the rim is difficult to control by the person skilled in the art in the current structures of tyres with bead wires around which a carcass reinforcement is wound.<br>
The Applicant, has unexpectedly noted that the distribution of the contact pressures between the rim and the tyre at: the level of the respective rim and bead seats could be controlled and rendered as regular as possible i.n a very simple and reproducible manner whilst permitting an improvement in the resistance to unwinding of the carcass reinforcement in the event of a high degree of heating of the beads.<br>
Thus, the tyre according to the invention which is intended to be mounted on a rim of axial width L, with rim seats forming an angle y with the axis of rotation such that 0° 
"Rim flange, viewed in meridian section" should be understood to mean the assembly formed by the part substantially perpendicular to the axis of rotation extended, firstly, radially to the outside, by a circular part, forming what is sometimes referred to as<br>
the rim nook, and secondly, radially to the inside, by the arc of a circle connecting the axially outer end of the rim seat to said assembly.<br>
"Meridian profile of a carcass reinforcement in a bead" should be understood to mean the meridian profile of the geometric centre line of said reinforcement, viewed in meridian section, said profile being considered radially to the inside of a straight line parallel to the axis of rotation of the mounting rim and of the tyre passing through the point of the rim hook, corresponding to the bead in question, the farthest from the axis of rotation.<br>
"Inextensible reinforcement element" should be understood to mean a cable or a monofilament having a relative elongation of at most 1.5% under a force of 20% of the breaking load.  The additional layer will preferably be formed of metal cables or monofilaments, preferably or steel, in the case of tyres of the "heavy vehicle" or "civil engineering" type, but may advantageously be formed of textile elements, preferably of aromatic polyamide, in the case of tyres for aeroplanes, agricultural tractors or passenger cars, for example.<br>
A large number of rims and tyres may be covered by the invention; the meridian profile of the assembly formed by the carcass reinforcement and the first additional layer, which profile is very closely linked to the profile of the carcass reinforcement, will, within a bead, be advantageously adapted to the meridian profile of the side of the rim on which said bead will be mounted.  The meridian profile of the additional ply in effect does not differ from the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement except by the possible variation of the rubber decoupling layer existing between the two<br>
plies, which explains why the two profiles are said to be substantially parallel.<br>
Said meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in a bead will advantageously be formed, passing radially and axially towards the inside, by a first, concave, arc of a circle extended tangentially by a second, convex, arc of a circle, said second arc of a circle possibly being extended tangentially by a straight-line segment.<br>
The radially outer end of the first, concave, arc of a circle is firstly radially distant from the axis of rotation by an amount equal to the radius of the circle which is the geometric locus of the points of the rim flange which are farthest from said axis, and secondly axially distant from the equatorial plane by a quantity of between L + o.l L and L - 0.1 \L.  Said radially outer end is also the point of tangency with the convex meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the sidewall.  The centre of curvature of the first arc of a circle, relative to the two axes which are the trace of the equatorial plane and the axis of rotation, has the same coordinates as the centre of curvature of the rim hook.  As for the length of said first arc of a circle of the carcass reinforcement profile, it is at least zero, the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the bead beginning directly with the second, convex, arc of a circle and at most equal to the length of an arc of a circle the radially lower end of which would be the point of tangency of said arc with a line perpendicular to the axis of rotation.<br>
Said first arc of a circle is tangentially extended radially and axially to the inside by a second arc of a circle of a radius of curvature which may be between a minimum value of 5 mm and a maximum value equal to the<br>
radius of curvature of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the sidewall measured at the point; of tangency between said profile and the first arc of a circle, said maximum value being the value of radius used preferably when the first arc of a circle has a length of zero.<br>
The second arc of a circle is possibly tangentially extended radially and axially to the inside by a straight-line segment, the axially inner end of which is also the end of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement.  The axially inner edge of the meridian profile is composed either of part of the second arc of a circle to which the straight-line segment is added, or of part: of an arc of a circle.  Said edge is the part of the meridian profile located in an angle defined by a half line forming a tangent to the second arc of a circle and forming with the axis of rotation an angle of 25" and a half line parallel to said axis of rotation, the origin of which is precisely the point of tangency of the second arc of a circle with the half line oriented at 25".<br>
The first additional layer has an axially inner end which may be closer to or farther away from the equatorial plane than the axially inner end of the carcass reinforcement.  Between its axially inner end and the vertex of the angle in which the edge of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement is located, the first additional layer may be separated from the carcass reinforcement by a low thickness of rubber mix, a total of the two respective thicknesses of the calendering layers of the two adjacent plies, whereas between said vertex and the radially upper end said thickness is between 1.0 and 1.8 times the thickness previously mentioned.<br>
As described above, some tyres may have a carcass reinforcement formed of textile elements.  The end of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement can then not be merged with the end of said reinforcement, the latter being able to be turned up over the first additional layer.<br>
In the case of tyres having a high recommended inflation pressure, the first additional layer may be formed of two sections of several additional plies of inextensible reinforcement elements, superposed on one another, the lengths of which may or may not be the same.  If the presence of inextensible elements is necessary for the entire first section of the additional layer located radially to the inside of a straight line parallel to the axis of rotation and located at a distance from said axis equal to 0.96 times the distance between said axis and the point of the corresponding flange of the mounting rim farthest from said axis of rotation, the possible second section of the additional layer extending the first section, located radially to the outside of said straight line, and therefore in the bead and even in the sidewall of the tyre, may be formed of reinforcement elements which are either inextensible or have a certain extensibility or at least render said section extensible; thus continuous elements can be used for said part which are preferably metal ones and are said to be elastic, that is to say, having a relative elongation of at least 1.5% under a tensile force equal to 20% of the breaking load, or undulating or zigzag elements in the plane of the ply or plies forming the layer, or even of circum-ferentially discontinuous elements, each element having a circumferential length which may be between 0.1 and 1 times the circumferential length of the ply and the gaps between elements being meridianly offset relative to the gaps of the axially adjacent rows.<br>
In the case or a high inflation pressure, the presence of a second continuous additional reinforcement layer nay also prove very advantageous.  Said second layer, axially to the outside and radially to the inside of at least the radially innermost and axially outermost ply of the carcass; reinforcement, also has a meridian profile substantially parallel to the meridian profile of said carcass reinforcement in the bead.  Said layer is formed of at least one ply of reinforcement elements.  It may be continuous and homogenous over its entire length from its radially upper end which may be located radially to the outside, but preferably radially to the inside, of the straight line parallel to the axis of rotation of the rim and passing through the point of the rim flange, corresponding to the bead in question, which is farthest from the axis of rotation, until its axially inner end closest to the equatorial plane.  It is then advantageously formed of inextensible cables, preferably metal ones, forming an angle of between -2.5° and +2.5° with the circumferential direction.  The second additional layer may also be non-homogenous over its width although continuous: it is then formed of two sections, or of three sections.<br>
In the case in which its radially upper end is radially to the inside of the straight line parallel to the axis of rotation and passing through the point of the rim flange farthest from said axis of rotation, said second layer comprises a first section included between its radially upper end and a point located between the centre of the second arc of a circle of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the bead and the vertex of the angle a in which the edge of the carcass reinforcement is located, and a second section, extending the first section axially to the inside and radially to the inside and included between said point<br>
and its radially lower end axially closest to the equatorial plane.  The first section is formed of at least one ply of inextensible cables, whilst the second section is advantageously formed of at least one ply of reinforcement elements, said ply having the properties of being only very slightly compressible in the transverse direction and advantageously extensible in the circumferential direction, which, firstly, permits simple and reproducible control of the pressures exerted by the bead seat on the rim seat, the inventors having unexpectedly noted that said pressures were a function of the resistance to tension of the reinforcement elements constituting the ply (plies) of the second section of the second additional layer, and, secondly, facilitates the laying during manufacture of said additional layer.<br>
In the event that the radially upper end of the second additional layer is radially to the outside of the straight line parallel to the axis of rotation and passing through the point of the rim flange farthest from said axis of rotation, the second layer may then comprise, in addition to the first and second sections previously described, a third section substantially located radially above the straight line parallel to the axis of rotation and passing through the point of the corresponding rim flange farthest from said axis of rotation,<br>
The first; section is formed of at least one ply of inextensible cables, preferably metal ones made of steel, and forming an angle between -2.5° and +2.5° with the circumferential direction.  The second section is advantageously formed of at least one ply of reinforcement, elements, said ply having the properties of being only very slightly compressible in the transverse direction and advantageously extensible in<br>
the circumferential direction, which, firstly, permits simple and reproducible control of the pressures exerted by the bead seat on the rim seat, the inventors having unexpectedly noted that said pressures were a function of the resistance to tension of the reinforcement elements constituting the ply (plies) of the second section of the second additional layer, and, secondly, facilitates the laying during manufacture of said additional layer.  As for the third section, it is advantageously formed of at least one ply of reinforcement elements, said ply having the property of being extensible in the circumferential direction.<br>
The ply (plies) of the second and third sections of the second additional layer may thus be formed of elastic, continuous;, rectilinear reinforcement elements oriented circumferentially, said reinforcement elements preferably being metal or textile ones, like the elements referred to above and used for the second section of the first additional layer.  They may be formed of undulating or zigzag reinforcement elements of circumferential average orientation, or of rows of discontinuous reinforcement elements, with the same characteristics as those referred to previously, said elements or rows of elements however in this case being parallel to each other and practically adjacent in the transverse direction.  The ply (plies) of said second section may also be formed of metal reinforcement elements oriented at an angle of at least 80° relative to the circumferential direction, said elements being circumferentially separated from each other by a distance of at. least 0.2 mm.  It may be advantageous in this latter case to provide one (several) width(s) of said ply (plier,) sufficient to be able to turn it (them) up over the end of the carcass reinforcement. Furthermore, the laying of the second section of the second layer may be facilitated further if the ply<br>
(plies) of said section are formed of strips of several circumferential reinforcement elements, which strips are circumferentially discontinuous, the discontinuity gaps between strips forming with the circumferential direction an angle which is different from the angle formed with the same direction by the reinforcement elements of the carcass reinforcement, the difference being at least 10°.<br>
In the event that the carcass reinforcement is formed of at most three plies, the second additional layer, whatever the number of plies and whatever the nature of the elements of which it is composed, is preferably located in its entirety axially to the outside and radially to the inside of the carcass reinforcement. In the event that the carcass reinforcement is formed of at least four plies, the plies forming the second additional layer are such that two of them may advantageously tightly surround a group which may be formed of one, two or three carcass reinforcement plies.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a tyre to be mounted on a rim of axial width L, with rim seats forming an angle y with the axis of rotation such that 0° 
The characteristics and advantages or the present invention will be better understood with reference to the following description, which refers to the drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a bead of a tyre for an agricultural tractor according to the invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a bead of a tyre for a passenger car according to the invention,<br>
Figure 3 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a bead of a tyre for a "heavy vehicle" tyre,<br>
Figure 4 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a bead of a tyre for civil engineering machinery according to the invention,<br>
Figures 5A to 5C relate to a bead of a tyre for an aeroplane, Figure 5A showing a diagram of a first variant of a bead for a radial tyre, Figure 5B being a plan view of the second additional layer used in the case of Figure 5A, and Figure 5C showing a diagram of a second variant of a bead for a cross-ply tyre.<br>
The tyre of dimension 540/65 R 26, for an agricultural tractor (Figure 1), has an H/S form ratio of 0.65.  The tread of said tyre (not shown) is joined to the beads (3) by means of two sidewalls (2).  Said tyre is reinforced by a radial carcass reinforcement (1) surmounted by a crown reinforcement (not shown), and said carcass reinforcement is composed of two radial textile plies of 140x2 nylon cables (11) and (12).  The meridian profile of the geometric centre line (shown in dashes) of said reinforcement, viewed in meridian section, said profile being considered radially to the inside of a straight line XX' parallel to the axis of rotation of the mounting rim and of the tyre passing through the point of the rim flange, corresponding to the bead in question, farthest from the axis of rotation, is formed by a first, concave, arc of a circle AB. forming a tangent at A to the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement in the sidewall (2) and at: B to a second, convex, arc of a circle BC, which itself is extended tangentially and axially to the inside by a straight-line segment CD, D being the<br>
end of the carcass reinforcement (1), located axially at 0.4 times the rim width L of the equatorial plane. Since said tyre is intended to be mounted on a rim of dimension DW 15, the standardised width of which is 381 mm, and the points of the rim flanges of which farthest from the axis of rotation are located on a circle of a radius of 356 mm, the point A is at a distance from the axis of rotation of 345 mm, and distant axialiy from the equatorial plane (not shown) by an amount equal to 183 mm.  The point B, which is the point of tangency with the second arc of a circle BC, is also the point of tangency with a straight line perpendicular to the axis of rotation, the arc of a circle AB thus having the maximum length.  Said meridian profile is therefore curved passing axially and radially from the outside to the inside to form an axially inner edge SD, located in an angle a which is open axially and radially to the inside, one of the sides of which, which forms an angle of 25° with the axis of rotation, is at a tangent to the second arc of a circle BC at S, and the other side of which, starting from S, is parallel to said axis of rotation.<br>
The carcass reinforcement (1) in the bead (3) is reinforced axially to the inside and radially to the outside by an additional ply (6) of inextensible steel 68x23 cables, of a diameter of 2.8 mm, the breaking load of which is at least 700 daN, which are oriented at 0° relative to the circumferential direction.  Said ply (6) has one radially upper end above the straight line XX' and one radially lower end close to the end of the carcass reinforcement.  It is separated from the carcass reinforcement (2) by a rubber decoupling layer (8) having the special feature of being thicker in the pseudo-vertical section of the carcass reinforcement/ additional ply assembly, whilst it is only equal to the total of the two calendering thicknesses of the cables<br>
of the carcass ply and of the additional ply respectively in the pseudo-horizontal section.  Said rubber layer has a modulus of elasticity in tension (secant modulus) of at least 30 for a relative elongation of 10%.<br>
Radially to the inside and axially to the outside, there is present a second additional ply (7) which is formed in its first section (70) of continuous steel 68x23 cables, said cables being inextensible and oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle of at most 2.5°.  Said second additional ply (7) is parallel in its first section (70) to the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement (1) in the bead (3) in question.  Whilst the radially upper end of said second additional ply (7) is slightly located to the inside of the straight line XX' parallel to the axis of rotation passing through the point of the rim hook farthest from the axis of rotation, the first section (70) of said ply (7) has its radially lower end Located on the same line perpendicular to the axis of rotation as the point S of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement (1).  Said first part (70) of the additional ply (7) is extended axially by a second part (71) parallel to the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement (I) and formed of 9x28 cables, oriented at an angle of 90° relative to the circumferential direction.  The second section (71) is turned up over the ends of the carcass reinforcement (I) and of the first additional ply (6) to form an upturn (72),  All the plies are covered radially to the outside with the conventional protective rubber layer (5) intended to establish contact with the mounting rim.  The entire bead is completed by one (or more) rubber fillers (4) axially to the inside and radially to the outside of the additional layer (6).<br>
The tyre of dimension 175/70 R 13 shown in Figure 2 is a tyre for a. passenger car.  Taking the same references as those of Figure 1 to designate the same elements, said tyre comprises a carcass reinforcement (1) formed of a single textile ply (1) of polyester cables.  As previously, the meridian profile of the carcass ply (1) in the bead (3) is composed of the arc of a circle AB, which is tangent to the arc BC, which itself is a tangent and extended by the straight-line segment CD. The carcass reinforcement is reinforced in the bead firstly, radially to the outside and axially to the inside, by a first additional ply (6) formed of 9x28 metal cables of steel, oriented circumferentially, and secondly, radially to the inside and axially to the outside, by a second additional ply (7), the two sections of which are formed of the same 9x28 cables and are also oriented circumferentially.  If the radially upper ends of the two additional plies (6), (7) respectively meet the conditions listed previously, the radially lower ends offer the special feature of being closer to the equatorial plane than the end of the carcass ply, the two edges of the additional plies becoming adjcicent.<br>
The "heavy vehicle" tyre of dimension 385/65 R 22.5 (Figure 3), intended to be mounted on a drop-centre rim having rim seats inclined at 15°, comprises, taking the same references and as previously, a tread joined to two beads (3) by two sidewalls (2).  A carcass reinforcement, formed of a single ply (1) of metal cables, made of steel, reinforces said tyre.  The meridian profile of the carcass ply (1) is still composed of the two arcs of a circle AB and BC, the arc BC being extended by a straight-line segment CD forming an angle of 20* with the axis of rotation.  The point A is distant from the equatorial plane by an amount equal to 149 mm, namely 0.5 times the width of rim 11.75 on<br>
which the tyre will be mounted, whilst the point D is distant from the same plane by an amount equal to 0.3 times the same rim width.  The arc of a circle AB, as can be seen in Figure 3, does not have the maximum possible length, owing to the special shape of the meridian profile of the flange of the 15°-seat rim, point B not being a point of tangency with a straight line perpendicular to the axis of rotation.  The radially outer and axially inner additional layer (6) is formed of two plies (6.) and (62) of 68x23 metal cables made of steel, oriented circumferentially, and the breaking load of which is at least 700 daN.  The radially lower ends of the two plies are farther from the equatorial plane than the end of the carcass ply and the radially upper ends are radially to the outside of the straight line XX'.  As for the second additional layer, it is formed of three parts:<br>
a third section (73) extending from its radially upper end to a line parallel to the axis of rotation passing through the point A and formed of a ply of metal cables made of steel which undulate in the plane of said ply and are of average circumferential orientation and have a ratio a/λ. of amplitude of undulation a to the wavelength λ which may be between 0.03 and 0.1;<br>
a first section (70), extending from the point A to a line perpendicular to the lowered axis of rotation of the point C of the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement, and formed of a ply of inextensible metal 68x23 cables made of steel, oriented circumferentially and of a diameter of 2.8 mm, and<br>
axially to the inside starting from said point C a second section (71) formed of a ply of metal<br>
cables made of steel which undulate in the plane of the layer and ply of constitution identical to the ply forming the third section, that is to say with the same ratio a/A and with the same cables, of smaller diameter than that of the cables of the first part (70) since it is equal to 1.4 mm.<br>
Figure 4 shows a tyre of dimension 26.5 R 25, intended firstly to be mounted on a rim of standardised width of 495 mm and with seats inclined, relative to the axis of rotation, by an angle of 50, and secondly to be fitted on civil engineering site machinery.  The carcass reinforcement of said tyre is, as in the previous example, composed of a single ply (1) of metal cables made of steel.  The meridian profile of the carcass ply (1) offers the special feature of being formed only of a single arc of a circle AD, the arc of a circle AB in this case having a length of zero, and the straight-line segment CD being non-existent.  The arc of a circle AD is at a tangent at A to the meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement (1) in the sidewall (2); its radius oi. curvature is equal to the radius of said profile of the carcass reinforcement at A and constant over the entire length AD.  The point A is distant from the equatorial plane by an amount equal to 237 mm, or 0.48 times the rim width on which the tyre in question will be mounted, and the point D is distant from the same plane by an amount equal to 0.36 times said rim width.  The carcass reinforcement (1), in the bead, is reinforced axially to the inside and radially to the outside by an assembly (6) of three additional plies (6,, 62, 6-5} of inextensible metal 68x23 FR cables made of steel, oriented circumferentially, the diameter of which is equal to 2.8 mm and the breaking load of which is greater than 700 daN.  Said three plies, of widths which decrease radially towards the outside, have their radially upper ends to the outside of the straight line<br>
XX' and their radially lower ends slightly farther from the equatorial plane than the end of the carcass reinforcement. (1).  Said three plies are radially above the point S (vertex of the angle defined firstly by the tangent to the arc of a circle BC forming an angle of 25° with the axis of rotation and secondly by a line parallel to said axis) decoupled from the carcass reinforcement by a layer of rubber (8) the thickness of which is 2 mm and the modulus of elasticity in tension of which at a relative elongation of 10% is 40 MPa.  A second additional layer, composed of two sections (70) and (71), completes the structure in the bead in question.  The first section (70), axially to the outside, is formed of at least one ply of inextensible metal 27x23 NF cables made of steel, whilst the second section (71) is formed of at least one ply of rows of inextensible metal cables made of steel which are circumferentlally discontinuous, the gaps between lengths of cables being offset meridianly and the ply thus formed having a certain circumferential extensibility whilst being only very slightly compressible in the transverse direction.  The axially inner end of the second section (71) is located axially to the outside of the radially lower end of the carcass reinforcement (1) and the width of said second section is preferably between 0.7 and 0.9 times the width of the frustoconical seat of the bead (3), whilst the radially upper end of the first section (70), which extends said second section, is located radially to the outside of the straight line XX', having the following special features: the portion located radially to the inside of the straight line XX' is adjacent to the carcass reinforcement (1), the respective cables of the two plies being separated from each other only by the conventional calendering thicknesses of the plies, whilst the portion located radially to the outside of the straight line XX' is greatly disconnected from the<br>
carcass reinforcement (1) by a layer (9) of rubber mix of a thickness of at least 2.5 mm and of the same secant modulus of elasticity in tension as that of the mix forming the layer (8).  The meridian profile of the carcass reinforcement and of the assembly formed by said reinforcement and the additional layers is such that the rubber protective layer (5), providing the junction with the mounting rim, is greatly thickened at the level of the rounding of the bead joining the seat and the vertical section of said bead.  It is then advantageous, as shown in Figure 4, to divide the layer (5) into two sections: a first, outer, section (51) of substantially constant thickness providing the junction with the rim and a second, inner, section (52) in the form of a triangle and having the special feature of being formed of a rubber mix of high modulus of elasticity in tension compared with that of the mixture forming the section (51): for example, the secant modulus in tension at. 10% relative elongation of the section (52) is at least 30 MPa, whilst said same modulus is equal to 6 MPa for the part (51) .<br>
The example described and illustrated in Figures 5A and 5B relates to an aeroplane tyre of dimension 40x14.19, intended to be mounted on a 9.5x19 rim of axial width of 241 mm and having seats inclined at 5°.  The tyre in question is a tyre with radial carcass reinforcement (1) comprising a plurality of carcass plies, 6 in number.  The profile of the geometric centre line of the carcass reinforcement (1) (marked in dashes) is still formed of the arcs of a circle AB and BC, the latter being extended axially to the inside by a straight-line segment CD and D being the end of said carcass reinforcement (1), located at a distance equal to 0.15 times the rim width of the equatorial plane. The first additional layer (6) is formed of three plies (6,, 6,, 63) of inextensible metal 68x23 FR cables made<br><br>
of steel of a diameter of 2.8 mm and a breaking load of at least 700 daN.  The second additional layer (7) is formed firstly of two plies (7A, 7B), each additional ply (7A, 7B) being inserted between two groups of two carcass reinforcement plies and, secondly, a third additional pi.y (7C) radially to the inside and axially to the outside of the radially innermost and axially outermost, group of two carcass plies.  Each of the three plies (7A, 7B, 7C) is formed of a first section (70A, 70B, 70C), formed of inextensible, circumferential metal 68x23 FR cables made of steel, and of a second section (71A, 71B, 71C) composed of strips of ten metal 27x23 NF cables made of steel, said strips being circumferentially discontinuous and the lines of discontinuity forming, with the circumferential direction, an angle r, which is in no case equal to the angle formed by the cables of the radial carcass reinforcement, and preferably differing by at least 10° therefrom.  The strips are arranged axially in the desired number to obtain the desired axial width of each of the plies of the second part (Figure 5B), and may be arranged end to end, or with a certain overlap.<br>
The second example described and illustrated in Figure 5C also relates to an aeroplane tyre of the same dimension as before.  The tyre in question is this time a cross-ply tyre (1), comprising a plurality of carcass plies, of an even number of 12, of nylon cables crossed from one ply to the next.  The large number of carcass plies, contrary to the case described previously, results in a profile of the geometric centre line of the carcass reinforcement (1) (marked in dashes) which is without the arc of a circle AB, the point B being merged with point A, the arc of a circle BC being extended axially towards the inside by a straight-line segment CD and D being the end of said centre line of the carcass reinforcement (1).  The first additional<br><br>
layer (6), radially to the outside and axially to the inside, is formed of a single ply (6,) of circumferential, inextensible metal 68x23 FR cables made of steel, whilst the second additional layer (7), radially to the inside and axially to the outside of the radially outermost and axially innermost group of two carcass plies is formed firstly of five plies (7A to 7E), each ply (7A, 7B ... 7E) being held tightly between two groups of two carcass plies and, secondly, of a sixth ply (7F) axially to the outside and radially to the inside of the radially innermost and axially outermost, group of two carcass plies.  Said plies (7) are all formed of inextensible, circumferential metal 68x23 FR cables made of steel.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
