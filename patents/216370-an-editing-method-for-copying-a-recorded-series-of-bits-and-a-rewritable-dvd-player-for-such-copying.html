				<td>COPY FEATURE FOR RECORDABLE DVD EDITING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The inventive arrangements relate generally to methods and apparatus<br>
providing advanced operating features for audio only, video only and both video<br>
and audio programs recorded on disc media, for example recordable digital video<br>
discs, hard drives and magneto optical discs.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Various devices have been developed to enable consumers to record video<br>
and/or audio programs for later presentation. Such devices include tape<br>
recorders, video cassette recorders, recordable compact discs, and most<br>
recently, recordable digital video discs (DVD). Hard drives and magneto optical<br>
discs have also been used.<br>
A DVD that can be recorded on only once, and thereafter is essentially a<br>
DVD read only memory, is referred to by the acronym DVD-R. The acronym<br>
DVD-R is also used generally to refer to the write-once, or record-once,<br>
technology. Several formats are available for DVD"s to be recorded on, erased<br>
and re-recorded; that is, overwritten or rewritten. These are referred to by the<br>
acronyms DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and DVD + RW. As of this time no uniform<br>
industry standard has been adopted. The acronyms DVD-RAM, DVD-RW and<br>
DVD + RW are also used generally to refer to the respective rewritable<br>
technologies. Reference herein to rewritable DVD technology, devices and<br>
methods is generally intended to encompass all of the standards which are now<br>
being used, as well as those which may be developed in the future.<br>
Depending upon the standard that is eventually adopted, if any, certain<br>
recording schemes used to implement various advanced features will be<br>
compatible with all devices adhering to the standard, whereas other recording<br>
schemes may prove to be incompatible due to inconsistencies with the standard.<br>
Nevertheless, a particular proprietary advanced feature incompatible with other<br>
devices can still be very desirable from a consumer"s point of view. The result is<br>
merely that a recording made in accordance with an incompatible advanced<br>
feature cannot be played back on the device of a different manufacturer, even if<br>
conventional recordings are fully compatible and portable.<br>
In many cases, the program presentations are recorded in the viewer<br>
and/or listener"s absence, for presentation at a later, more convenient time. This<br>
is referred to as time shifting the program. At other times, a program is being<br>
viewed and/or listened to without being recorded, and with out any interest in a<br>
recording, but the viewer"s and/or listener"s attention is interrupted, for example<br>
by a telephone call or an unexpected visitor. If the viewer and/or listener is<br>
watching a television program, for example, and has a cassette tape in a VCR, or<br>
can retrieve and load such a cassette tape quickly, the program can be recorded.<br>
However, the viewer and/or listener cannot view and/or listen to the program in<br>
its entirety, and in a proper time sequence, until after the recording has been<br>
completed. The time to completion of the recording can be short or long,<br>
depending on the length of the program.<br>
Although rewritable DVD technology is generally available, operation is<br>
limited to such basic functions as play, record, fast forward reverse and stop.<br>
Pause is available, but only as a counterpart to pause operation in a VCR, for<br>
example interrupting the play back of a prerecorded program or interrupting the<br>
recording of a viewed program to eliminate commercials from the recording.<br>
Unlike computer hard drives, recordable DVD devices have a very significant<br>
additional function, which is playing back prerecorded DVD"s. Thus, there is an<br>
economic incentive to develop rewritable DVD technology, including methods<br>
and devices, that can be used instead of a computer hard drive. It is a challenge<br>
to provide such devices with improved, advantageous features without<br>
compromising the goal of decreasing costs and increasing sales.<br>
DVD machines typically have a 1X read and 1X write capability. Such<br>
devices can typically have maximum data rates for recording or playing back of<br>
approximately 11 megabits/second. Thus, a key consideration for implementing<br>
certain copy functions for the purposes of the present invention is the relatively<br>
slow rate for reading and especially recording data on a DVD. This slow rate is<br>
attributable in large part to the nature of the mechanical assembly of<br>
conventional DVD devices and the limitations associated with reading and<br>
especially writing data to an optical disc.<br>
For example, the high speed read access capability of conventional<br>
computer hard drives permit data to be read from discontinuous locations on the<br>
magnetic disc without any apparent interruption in the data. By comparison,<br>
with the relatively slower reading speed of a DVD, the data stream as physically<br>
located on the disc must be approximately continuous so as to avoid<br>
discontinuities in the playback of video or other media. Thus, a DVD copy<br>
feature requires data to physically be re-written to the proper location on the disc<br>
and cannot simply rely upon pointers or jump commands to physically separate<br>
areas of the disk.<br>
It will be appreciated that in order to physically copy video data from one<br>
disk location to another as described above, a DVD device must have random<br>
access memory (RAM) for storing video data to be transferred. In fact, in order<br>
to accomplish this task efficiently, it is helpful to have as much RAM available as<br>
possible. However, inclusion of additional RAM in a DVD device adds expense<br>
which may not be acceptable to consumers. In fact, a key to the success of<br>
such DVD products is the ability of manufacturers to include new and useful<br>
features while continuing to reduce cost. Accordingly, a solution to the problem<br>
is required which allows the DVD copy feature to be implemented without the<br>
addition or expense of additional memory.<br>
Rewritable DVD technology typically uses MPEG-2 encoders and decoders<br>
and many acronyms are encountered that are related to MPEG-2. The DVD<br>
standard, for example, calls for the video content of the disc to be divided up<br>
into video object units (VOBUs) in which each VOBU typically contains 0.4 to<br>
1.0 seconds of presentation material. Each VOBU starts off with a navigation<br>
pack (NV_PCK or NAV_PACK). The navigation pack contains a lot of navigation<br>
information, some of which is very useful for trick modes. As used herein, trick<br>
modes refer to any operational mode for a recordable disc media other than the<br>
standard play mode. Thus, such modes can include reverse, fast forward, pause<br>
mode and so on.<br><br>
The navigation pack includes presentation control information (PCI) and<br>
data search information (DSI). One example is the inclusion of the start<br>
addresses for many of the nearby VOBUs. This can facilitate jumping to the next<br>
VOBU forward or backward, or for a faster trick mode, to the second VOBU<br>
forward or backward, or to the third, etc. Another example is the inclusion of<br>
the end address for the first three reference pictures in the VOBU. This is the<br>
only clue given as to the structure of the VOBU.<br>
Each video object set (VOBS) includes a plurality of video objects. Each<br>
video object includes a plurality of cells. Each cell includes a plurality of VOBUs.<br>
Each of the VOBUs containing the video content of the disc typically contains<br>
0.4 to 1.0 seconds of presentation material. A typical VOBU in a commercial<br>
movie contains 0.5 second of presentation material, corresponding to one group<br>
of pictures (GOP). Each VOBU is a sequence of packs in recording order. Each<br>
VOBU starts with exactly one navigation pack and encompasses all of following<br>
kinds of packs, including a video pack (V_PCK), an audio pack (A_PCK) and a<br>
sub-picture pack (SP_PCK).<br>
Data search information (DSI) helps the decoder to find reference pictures<br>
within the VOBU corresponding to the current Nav_Pack. DSI also helps the<br>
decoder to find VOBUs far into the future or past of presentation data, relative to<br>
the current VOBU. The VOBUs in the past relative to the current VOBU<br>
presentation are referenced in fields of the Nav_Pack known as the BWDI<br>
(backward information). The VOBUs in the future relative to the current VOBU<br>
presentation are referenced in fields of the Nav_Pack known as FWDI (forward<br>
information). One example is the inclusion of the start addresses for many of the<br>
nearby VOBUs, up to +240 VOBU forward and -240 VOBU backward<br>
directions. This can facilitate jumping to the next VOBU forward or backward, or<br>
for a faster trick mode, to the second VOBU forward or backward, or to the<br>
third, etc. The video, audio, subpicture, presentation control information and<br>
data search information are the five components of the DVD bit stream.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A method is provided for copying a recorded series of bits from a first<br>
location to a second location on a rewritable disc media. The method includes<br>
the steps of selectively marking a beginning point and an end point of a segment<br>
of the recorded series of bits, and a location to which said segment is to be<br>
copied prior to said reading step. Subsequently, video data comprising at least a<br>
portion of the segment of the recorded series of bits to be copied is read from<br>
the disk and stored in a track buffer of a DVD device. At least part of the video<br>
data from the track buffer is subsequently transferred directly from the track<br>
buffer to the record buffer by a control processor of the DVD device. Finally, the<br>
portion of the video data stored in the track buffer is written to the second<br>
location.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the method can include the step<br>
of modifying one or more of a navigation pack, video pack, audio pack and<br>
subpicture pack data so that such information for the copied segment is correct<br>
as to the second location. Similarly, the method can include modifying a VTSI<br>
and the VMGI on the disc containing the second location.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the method can include the step of<br>
comparing a video format of the segment to a video format of the bit stream at<br>
the second location. Such a comparison allows the control CPU or processor to<br>
determine if the video format of the source is the same as the destination.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a DVD device is provided for copying a<br>
recorded series of bits from a first location to a second location on a rewritable<br>
disc media. The device includes suitable DVD read and write circuitry, and<br>
special programming for implementing the copy function as described herein.<br>
The device includes interface circuitry and software for permitting a user to<br>
selectively mark a beginning point and an end point of a segment of the recorded<br>
series of bits, and a location to which the segment is to be copied. The device<br>
includes circuitry and programming for reading from the disk video data<br>
comprising at least a portion of the segment of the recorded series of bits, and<br>
for storing such data in a track buffer of the DVD device. A control processor<br>
and suitable interface circuitry is provided for causing at least part of the video<br>
6<br>
data from the track buffer to be subsequently transferred directly from the track<br>
buffer to the record buffer. The device further includes suitable circuitry and<br>
programming for causing the portion of the video data stored in the track buffer<br>
to be written to the second location.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the device can include the<br>
circuitry and software for modifying one or more of a navigation pack, video<br>
pack, audio pack and subpicture pack data so that such information for the<br>
copied segment is correct as to the second location. Similarly, the device can<br>
include circuitry and any necessary software for modifying a VTSI and the VMGI<br>
on the disc containing the second location.<br>
According to yet another aspect, the device can include the circuitry and<br>
processing capability for comparing a video format of the segment to a video<br>
format of the bit stream at the second location. Such a comparison allows the<br>
control CPU or processor to determine if the video format of the source is the<br>
same as the destination.<br>
Finally, if the content comprising the video segment is still useful, it can be<br>
temporarily stored in an available memory space until it is overwritten. Thus,<br>
this segment can remain in memory to be copied to another location, should the<br>
user so desire.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Recordable DVD Device<br>
A device 100 for implementing the various advanced operating features in<br>
accordance with the inventive arrangements taught herein utilizes a rewritable<br>
disc medium 102 in accordance with the inventive arrangements is shown in<br>
block diagram form in Figure 1. The rewritable disc medium 102 is embodied as<br>
a rewritable DVD in the illustrated embodiment. In many instances, as will be<br>
noted, the rewritable disc medium can also be, for example, a hard drive or a<br>
magneto optical disc (MOD). An example of a MOD is a mini-disc. In many<br>
instances, the inventive arrangements are applicable to video or audio or both<br>
video and audio.<br>
The device 100 is capable of writing onto and reading from the disc<br>
medium, in this example, a rewritable DVD 102. The device comprises a<br>
mechanical assembly 104, a control section 120, a video/audio input processing<br>
path 140 and a video/audio output processing path 170. The allocation of most<br>
of the blocks to different sections or paths is self-evident, whereas the allocation<br>
of some of the blocks is made for purposes of convenience and is not critical to<br>
understanding the operation of the device.<br>
The mechanical assembly 104 comprises a motor 106 for spinning the<br>
DVD 102 and a pickup assembly 108 that is adapted to be moved over the<br>
spinning disc. A laser on the pickup assembly burns spots onto a spiral track on<br>
the disc or illuminates spots already burned onto the track for recording and<br>
playing back video and/or audio program material. For purposes of understanding<br>
the invention, it is irrelevant whether the disc is recordable on one or two sides,<br>
or in the event of a double-sided recording, whether the double-sided recording,<br>
or subsequent reading from the disc, takes place from the same side of the disc<br>
or from both sides. The pickup and the motor are controlled by a servo 110.<br>
The servo 110 also receives the Playback Signal of data read from the spiral<br>
track of the disc 102 as a first input. The Playback Signal is also an input to an<br>
error correction circuit 130, which can be considered part of the control section<br>
or part of the video/audio output processing path.<br><br>
The control section 120 comprises a control central processing unit (CPU)<br>
122 and a navigation data generation circuit 126. The control CPU 122 supplies<br>
a first input signal to the navigation data generation circuit 126 and the servo<br>
110 supplies a second input signal to the navigation data generation circuit 126.<br>
The servo can also be considered part of the control section. The navigation<br>
data generation circuit 126 supplies a first input signal to the multiplexer (MUX)<br>
154, which forms part of the video/audio input processing path 140. The output<br>
of the MUX 154 is an input to an error correction coding circuit 128. The output<br>
of the error correction coding circuit 128 is a recordable input signal supplied to<br>
the pickup 108, which will be "burned" onto the spiral track of the disc 102 by<br>
the laser.<br>
The control CPU 122 also preferably has access to the data contained in<br>
the track buffer 172 and record buffer 152 as shown in Fig. 1. CPU 122 can<br>
delete, modify, and reformat video data stored in the track buffer 172 and record<br>
buffer 152 for the purpose of implementing the inventive arrangements. Suitable<br>
software or firmware is provided in memory for the conventional operations<br>
performed by control CPU 122. In addition, program routines for the advanced<br>
features 134 are provided for controlling CPU 122 in accordance with the<br>
invention as shall hereinafter be described in greater detail.<br>
A control buffer 132 for viewer activatable functions indicates those<br>
functions presently available, namely play, record, reverse, fast forward,<br>
pause/play and stop. The pause is a counterpart to pause operation in a VCR,<br>
for example manually interrupting the play back of a prerecorded program or<br>
interrupting the recording of a viewed program to eliminate commercials from the<br>
recording. A separate buffer 136 is provided to receive commands for<br>
implementing the inventive arrangements taught herein.<br>
The video/audio input processing path 140 is a signal processing circuit for<br>
converting a conventional television signal, for example NTSC or PAL, into<br>
digitized packet data, for example MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, for digital recording by<br>
the device 100. The input path 140 comprises an NTSC decoder 142 and video<br>
encoder, for example MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, 144 for video in, and comprises an<br>
audio analog-to-digital converter (A/D) 146 and an audio encoder, for example<br><br>
MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, 148. The digitized signals are combined in a multiplexer<br>
1 50 and stored in a record buffer 152 until an entire packet has been<br>
constructed. As groups of packet are constructed, they are combined with the<br>
output of the navigation data generation circuit in the MUX 154 and sent to the<br>
error correction coding circuit 128. Error correction coding circuit 128 can also<br>
be deemed to be part of the input path 140.<br>
As a practical matter, the smallest addressable unit on the spiral track of a<br>
DVD is an ECC (error correction code) block of 16 sectors, where each sector<br>
includes 2048 bytes of user data. A group is a number of ECC blocks, for<br>
example 12. Each group of blocks represents approximately 0.5 seconds of<br>
combined video and audio program material. The amount of linear space along<br>
the spiral track needed to record a group of ECC blocks, for example 192<br>
sectors, is defined herein as a segment of the spiral track. Accordingly, it can<br>
appear that the record buffer needs to be only large enough to store one segment<br>
of data. One segment of data can correspond, for example, to approximately 0.5<br>
seconds of audio and video program material.<br>
The output processing path 170 comprises error correction block 130 and<br>
a track buffer, or output buffer, 172, in which data read from the disc is<br>
assembled into packets for further processing. The packets are processed by<br>
conditional access circuit 174 that controls propagation of the packets through<br>
demultiplexer 176 and into respective paths for video and audio processing.<br>
Accordingly, it can also appear that the track buffer 172 needs to be only large<br>
enough to store one segment of data, also corresponding to approximately 0.5<br>
seconds of audio and video program material.<br>
The video is decoded by decoder 178, for example from MPEG-1 or MPEG-<br>
2, and encoded as a conventional television signal, for example NTSC or PAL.<br>
The audio is decoded by circuit 182, for example from MPEG-1 or MPEG-2, and<br>
converted to analog form by audio digital-to-analog (D/A) converter 184. The<br>
output processing path 170 can be deemed to include the error correction circuit<br>
130, as noted.<br><br>
DVD Media<br>
For purposes of illustrating the inventive arrangements, program material<br>
can be recorded onto a rewritable DVD and played back from a rewritable DVD.<br>
A rewritable DVD 10 shown in Figure 2 is suitable for use as disc 102 in device<br>
100. The disc 10 is formed by a flat, round plastic plate-like member 12 having<br>
a hole 14 in the middle. The direction of recording on the track is typically<br>
outwardly along a spiral track 16, from a smaller radius part of the spiral to a<br>
larger radius part of the spiral. The several series of three large dots (- - -)<br>
denote portions of the track not shown in the drawing. As a result, the<br>
beginning of the spiral track is deemed to be near the hole 14, and is denoted by<br>
square 18. The end of the spiral is deemed to end near the rim, and is denoted<br>
by diamond 20. Those skilled in the art generally accept defining the beginning<br>
and end of the spiral as noted. Certain advanced features in accordance with the<br>
inventive arrangements utilize backward recording, that is, from a larger radius<br>
part of the spiral to a smaller radius part of the spiral. The track can also have a<br>
side-to-side wobble, not shown in the drawing, to accommodate media type<br>
indexing. Due to difficulties of scale only portions of the track 16 are shown,<br>
and these are shown in greatly enlarged scale.<br>
Each nearly circular, radially concentric section of the spiral is sometimes<br>
referred to as a track, but this terminology is not commonly accepted as having<br>
that specific meaning. In CD-ROM"s, for example, the term track is also used to<br>
refer to that portion of the spiral track that contains a single audio song, or other<br>
selection, and the same may or may not become common for DVD"s.<br>
It is often necessary to jump back one revolution of the track during<br>
operation due to the rotational speed of the disc medium being higher than<br>
needed. This is a common technique understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, each DVD contains a video manager 26 and video title<br>
set (VTS) 28. The VTS includes video title set information (VTSI) 27, an<br>
optional video object set for menu 29, one or more VOBS for title 30 which<br>
contains the actual title content and a VTSI backup 31. Each VOBS 30 is<br>
comprised of a plurality of video objects 32. Each video object 32 includes a<br>
plurality of cells 34. Each cell includes a plurality of VOBUs 36. Each of the<br><br>
VOBUs 36 in which the video content of the disc resides typically contains 0.4<br>
to 1.0 seconds of presentation material. Each VOBU 36 is a sequence of packs<br>
38 in recording order. Each VOBU starts with exactly one navigation pack and<br>
could encompass all of following kinds of packs, including video packs (VPCK),<br>
audio packs (APCK) and sub-picture packs (SPPCK).<br>
The VTSI 28 contains control data including the start and end addresses<br>
for all cells 34 and video object units 36. The VTSI can also includes jump<br>
commands where appropriate for moving from one VOBU to another, or from one<br>
cell to another. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with such jump<br>
commands as they are defined in the DVD specification. The jump command<br>
ensure continuity of program playback and direct the reading of data at various<br>
locations on the disc.<br>
Various modifications of the device illustrated in Figure 1 and the disc<br>
medium illustrated in Figure 2 can be used together to implement the advanced<br>
features taught herein in accordance with the inventive arrangements. It will be<br>
appreciated that the advanced features taught herein are applicable to other<br>
kinds of disc media and disc media players and recorders.<br>
A valid DVD program stream is segmented into presentation units known<br>
as VOBUs. Each VOBU is punctuated by its first pack being a navigation pack<br>
(NavPack), and the remaining packs consist of associated video, audio, and user<br>
presentation data packs. The NavPack contains presentation control<br>
information as well as data search information. The data search information is<br>
useful in performing "trick" modes of playback, that is, any mode other than<br>
normal play, stop and pause. One aspect of data search information (DSI) is that<br>
it helps the decoder to find reference pictures within the VOBU corresponding to<br>
the current NavPack. Another aspect of the DSI is that it helps the decoder to<br>
find VOBUs far into the future or past of presentation, relative to the current<br>
VOBU. The VOBUs in the past relative to the current VOBU presentation are<br>
referenced in fields of the NavPack known as the BWDI (backward information).<br>
The VOBUs in the future relative to the current VOBU presentation are<br>
referenced in fields of the NavPack known as FWDI (forward information).<br><br>
Copy, Feature For Recordable DVD Editing<br>
Recordable DVD has to have some editing features in order to let the<br>
consumer make their own home videos, such as wedding, birthday party, etc.<br>
Consumers may wish to copy portions of recorded video for use in different<br>
video presentations. In this regard a COPY function is provided in accordance<br>
with the inventive arrangements for a DVD recorder. The COPY function is used<br>
to copy a segment either within a disc or from a disc to another disc. This<br>
function provides the ability to edit a bit stream on a recordable DVD disc. The<br>
copy function is very useful for personal screen saver, photocopy, and more.<br>
Due to the relatively slow access times for reading and writing data to a<br>
DVD, it is not practical to rely upon pointers or jump commands to direct reading<br>
of data from physically separate areas of the disk. Such jumps will cause<br>
discontinuities in the video playback. Instead, copying requires data to<br>
physically be re-written to the new location on the disc if a seamless<br>
presentation is desired. In order to accomplish this task efficiently, it is helpful<br>
to have as much RAM available as possible for storing data to be copied, without<br>
increasing the cost of the DVD device.<br>
In accordance with the inventive arrangements, the foregoing problem is<br>
solved by designing the DVD recorder as shown in Fig. 1 so that the control CPU<br>
122 can access both the record buffer 152 and the track buffer 172 (also<br>
referred to as the play of reading buffer). The size of record buffer 152 and the<br>
track buffer 172 are relatively small compared to the large amount of video data<br>
on the disc. For example a typical DVD device may have only 128Mbit of RAM<br>
which is used for the track buffer and record buffer. However, if the copy<br>
command does not need to be implemented in real time, then this minimal<br>
amount of memory can be sufficient for allowing the copy feature to be<br>
implemented without the addition of any significant hardware costs.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flow chart illustrating the process for implementing the DVD<br>
copy feature according to the present invention. For the purpose of<br>
implementing an edit feature, an EDIT button can be provided on a remote<br>
control device. When the button EDIT is pressed, it is detected in step 502. In<br>
response thereto, a screen 70 can be displayed in step 504 with EDIT as a title<br><br>
and some or all the editing functions, such as DELETE, COPY, UNDELETE, etc.<br>
as shown in Figure 4(a). The screen can be displayed on a display device<br>
integrated into the DVD device or on an associated video monitor to which the<br>
DVD displays video presentations.<br>
The COPY function requires marking the segment that will be copied and<br>
indicating the disc location where the segment is to be inserted. According to<br>
one embodiment, if a COPY button 71 is selected in step 506, then the user is<br>
requested in step 508 to enter a mark 72, 74 at the beginning and at the end of<br>
the segment that will be copied, as shown in Figure 4(b). In step 508 the user is<br>
also preferably prompted to indicate the location where the copied segment is to<br>
be inserted. Marking can be accomplished by any suitable method which<br>
provides a reliable and accurate indication of the location where the segment<br>
begins and ends. According to a preferred embodiment, marking can be<br>
accomplished by storing in a memory location associated with control CPU 122 a<br>
disc sector number or an address identifying the beginning of a VOBU 36.<br>
However, the precise mode of marking is not critical and any other suitable<br>
method can be selected for this purpose. Trick mode can be used to allow the<br>
user to scan the program for marking the beginning and end points.<br>
Figure 4(d) is a representation of a bit stream showing a segment 73<br>
which has been marked by a user to be copied in accordance with step 508.<br>
After the segment 73 is marked, a screen (not shown) can be displayed to enable<br>
confirmation of the edit. If the edit is confirmed, a COPY Table 80 is created in<br>
step 510 which can be used in accordance with the inventive arrangements to<br>
perform the COPY function. According to a preferred embodiment, the<br>
information concerning the segment 73 to be copied can be stored in memory in<br>
a COPY Table as shown in Figure 4(c). The COPY Table 80 can include a<br>
segment identification name 82, a copied segment start address 84 and a copied<br>
segment end address 86.<br>
When copying, control CPU 122 causes relatively small portions of<br>
segment 73 to be read from DVD 102 in step 514 and stored in the track buffer<br>
172. The portions of data read from the disc are preferably selected so that they<br>
approximately fill the track buffer RAM 172. The contents of the track buffer<br>
172 can then be transferred to the record buffer 152 in step 516. The contents<br>
of the track buffer are then physically written in step 518 to the new location on<br>
the DVD 102. When the CPU determines that most of the contents of the<br>
record buffer 152 have been transferred to the DVD 102, then in step 520 the<br>
CPU can direct the DVD device 100 to read an additional portion of the segment<br>
73. In step 512, the CPU determines whether the entire segment 73 has been<br>
copied from the disc to the track buffer. If not, then the process continues as<br>
shown in steps 514 through 520. However, in step 512, if the entire content of<br>
the segment is determined to have been copied to the new location on the disk<br>
then so, the process is completed in step 522.<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, flash memory 145 may be included in certain<br>
DVD devices 100. Such memory is used for implementing certain features such<br>
as downloading internet data or MP3 files. For example, the flash memory for<br>
MP3 files can be 32 Mbytes or 64 Mbytes in size. Thus, in accordance with an<br>
alternative embodiment of the inventive arrangements, the copy problem can also<br>
be solved with minimal additional expense by using such flash memory to store<br>
the video data segment 73 which is to be copied. Although not necessarily as<br>
fast as conventional high speed RAM, such flash memory 145 may nevertheless<br>
be used as a suitable video buffer, particularly if the copy function does not need<br>
to be implemented in real time.<br>
If flash memory is used, a segment 73 can be divided into several pieces<br>
as described above, and each piece can be held in the flash memory. The data<br>
between start address and end address is read into the flash memory, and then<br>
written onto the new location of the disk, until all data is copied. Then the<br>
COPY Table is discarded.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, copyright and<br>
picture size issues are addressed as part of the copy process. If the program<br>
material is copyrighted, a warning can be displayed and the copy process can be<br>
terminated. If the picture size and video format of the source video are different<br>
from that of the destination, a warning can be given, and the copy process can<br>
be terminated by the user. The copyright and video format verification steps are<br><br>
preferably performed prior to creating the Copy table 80. However, the invention<br>
is not limited in this regard.<br>
During the copy process, it can become necessary to alter one or more of<br>
the navigation packs, the video packs, the audio packs and subpicture pack.<br>
Such alterations are necessary so that the information contained therein is<br>
correct relative to the new location of the segment 73 on the disc. In this<br>
regard, it will be appreciated that the insertion of segment 73 within a bit stream<br>
may in some instance require shifting of existing data associated with a video<br>
presentation to maintain continuity of playback. For example, when the segment<br>
73 is inserted in the middle of a video presentation, the video data in the bit<br>
stream following the insertion point will need to be moved to make room for the<br>
new data.<br>
Similarly, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that after the copy<br>
process is completed, it can become necessary to alter the cell information, the<br>
VTSI, the VMGI and the disk size data.<br>
