Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In order to make the object, technical scheme and merits of the present invention clearer, the present invention will be described hereinafter in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.<br>
 <br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart illustraling a method for implcmenting a three-dimensional panel at an IM client in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, The method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 101: Request information of entering a three-dimensional panel is received.<br>
The request information is sent through an entrance of a three-dimensional panel provided by a conventional panel after an IM user logs on the conventional panel. The entrance of the three-dimensional panel may be displayed in a menu mode, a button mode or the like. Optionally, the request information may be sent after the IM user directly logs on the three-dimensional panel when the IM user logs on the IM client.<br>
Step 102: Configuration information of the three-dimensional panel is obtained.<br>
The configuration information is basic information of the three-dimensional panel, e.g. display angle, brightness, size, etc. Generally, IM software may configure default configuration information. In order to meet the customized demands of the user, the user is allowed to configure the configuration information. Hence, when the configuration information of the three-dimensional panel is obtained, the configuration information configured by the user is obtained first. If the configuration information configured by the user can not be obtained, the default configuration information is obtained. The configuration information is usually stored locally by the user; and preferably, the configuration information may be stored in the IM server.<br>
Step 103: Identity information of IM contacts of the user is obtained,<br>
Because the IM contacts need to be displayed on the three-dimensional panel of the IM software, the identity information of the IM contacts of the user needs to be obtained. The identity information is obtained from the IM software logged by the user, which is suitable for a situation that the user has already logged on a non-three-dimensional panel. Optionally, the identity information may also be obtained from the IM server, which is suitable for a situation that the user has already logged on a non three-dimensional panel as well as a situation that the user has not logged on a non three-dimensional panel.<br>
Here, the identity information includes names, IM accounts, pictures for identifying themselves and so on used on the IM software by the IM contacts. Optionally, the identity<br>
 <br>
information includes at least one of the above.<br>
Step 104: The three-dimensional panel is started according to the configuration information, and the identity information of the IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel.<br>
At this step, the three-dimensional panel may be started by using such a three-dimensional engine as DirectX and OpenGL.<br>
After the three-dimensional panel is started, the identity information of the IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel. For example, the identity information of the IM contacts may be displayed on the three-dimensional panel in a distributed mode, i.e. there is some space between the IM contacts, so as to be convenient lor the user to .search and idcntil'y the IM contacts, Figure 2 shows one of display effects of the first embodiment of the present invention. In Figure 2, an initialized waist-level view is given. In the three-dimensional panel shown in Figure 2, the pictures of the IM contacts are erect and counterclockwise rotated for a certain angle. Further, in the three-dimensional panel shown in Figure 2, the names used on the IM software by the IM contacts are also displayed.<br>
As can be seen, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the three-dimensional panel is implemented at the IM client, so that the IM contacts of the IM user can be displayed on the three-dimensional panel, and thus the IM user can communicate with the IM contacts in a three-dimensional scene. In this way, the problem that the conventional panel is single and short of originality is solved, and better user experiences can be brought to the IM user.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention further provides another method for implementing a three-dimensional panel at an IM client. Figure 3 shows a flowchart illustrating a method for implementing a three-dimensional panel at an IM client in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 301: Request information of entering a three-dimensional panel is received.<br>
Step 302: Configuration information of the three-dimensional panel is obtained.<br>
 <br>
Step 303: Identity information of IM contacts is obtained.<br>
Step 304: Group information of the IM contacts is obtained.<br>
Since all IM users have a certain number of IM contacts, the IM contacts of an IM user are usually divided into groupsi Iso as to make the IM user rapidly search the IM contacts. For example, the IM contacts may be divided into different groups, such as a student group, a colleague group, etc. Therefore, it is needed to display the IM contacts in groups when the three-dimensional panel is displayed.<br>
Step 305: The three-dimensional panel is started according to the configuration information, and the identity information of the IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel in groups according to the group information.<br>
After the group information of the IM contacts of the IM user is obtained, the IM contacts are displayed on the three-dimensional panel according to the groups of the IM contacts. Generally, one group of IM contacts are displayed on the three-dimensional panel at a time, so that even if the IM contacts are numerous, the IM user can quickly find an IM contact which the IM user wants to communicate with.<br>
Preferably, a bird's-eye view may be provided on the three-dimensional panel. All user groups are displayed in the bird's-eye view, and the scene can be switched to the view shown in Figure 2 as long as the user clicks one of the groups. At this time, if the u.ser needs to enter another group, it is needed to return to the bird's-eye view, Preferably, a group entrance may be provided on the three-dimensional panel, and all the group information may be found at the group entrance. In this way, when the user intends to enter another group, it is just needed to click the group at the group entrance, and thus the scene can be switched to a view corresponding to the group. Here, the group entrance may be implemented in a menu mode or a button mode.<br>
As can be seen, in the second embodiment, the group information of the IM contacts is further obtained. In this way, the identity information of one group of IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel at a time, so that the u.ser can quickly search the IM contacts. In addition, various demands of the user can be met by displaying one group of IM contacts at a time. For example, when the user is working, only the IM contacts in a<br>
 <br>
colleague group are displayed.<br>
A third embodiment of the present invention provides a method for implementing a three-dimensional panel at an IM client. Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating the method for implementing the three-dimensional panel at the IM client in accordance with the third embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 401: Request information of entering a three-dimensional panel is received.<br>
Step 402: Configuration information of the three-dimensional panel is obtained.<br>
Step 403: Identity information of IM contacts is obtained.<br>
Step 404: Group information of the IM contacts is obtained.<br>
Step 405: Arranging information of the IM contacts is obtained.<br>
Since the IM contacts are numerous, in order to be convenient for the user to search out a desired IM contact, the IM contacts may be arranged in a certain mode, so that the user can search out the IM contact according to a mode needed by the user. For example, the IM contacts may be arranged according to names, communication frequencies, lengths of communication time and the like. Preferably, areas in which the IM contacts are located may be obtained according the IP addresses of the IM contacts, and then the IM contacts may be arranged according to the distance between the ureas of the IM contacts and the area in which the user is located. Preferably, the user may define the arranging mode of the IM contacts himself. In addition, the three-dimensional panel may display only on-line IM contacts or all the IM contacts in the corresponding group.<br>
Step 406: The three-dimensional panel is started according to the configuration information, the identity information of the IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel according to the groups corresponding to the group information, and the identity information of IM contacts in each group is arranged according to the arranging information.<br>
As can be seen, in the third embodiment, the arranging information of the IM contacts is further obtained, so that the IM contacts can be arranged on the three-dimensional<br>
 <br>
panel according to the obtained arranging information. Therefore, the user can quickly find a desired IM contact according to the arrangement of the IM contacts,<br>
In the second and third embodiments of the present invention, the implementing process of the three-dimensional panel is described in detail. Foi' facilitating the user to communicate with the IM contacts, after the three-dimensional panel is started, the following steps are included: operation information of changing the display of the three-dimensional panel is received; and the identity information of the IM contacts is displayed on the three-dimensional panel according to an operation requested by the operation information.<br>
Preferably, the operation information is to request to communicate with a certain user. Here, the communication with the IM contacts may include at least one of text communication, audio communication and video communication. In addition, the operation information may be to request to change the display content of the three-dimensional panel, such as an operation of translating a certain user.<br>
If the operation requested by the operation information is to communicate with a certain IM contact, a communication interface is opened, so that the user can communicate with the IM contact. The communication interface may be added to the original three-dimensional panel or may be a new window interface. When the communication object is a single IM contact, the identity information of the IM contact is displayed on the interface. When the communication object is a group including multiple single IM contacts, only one communication window is displayed when Ihc communication is performed, but the identity information of all the IM contacts participating in the communication is displayed on the interface. Further, the user may send a picture expressing a mood or wish to the communication object through the communication window. The picture preferably may be stored by the IM client or added by the user.<br>
When the user clicks a blank area or an IM contact on the three-dimensional panel, the vision focus of a three-dimensional scene displayed on (he three-dimensional panel may be translated to the blank area or the IM contact clicked by the u.ser. In practical applications, a gradually effect may be added to the translation, i.e. make the angle of<br>
 <br>
view move continuously to bring a new experience to the user,<br>
Preferably, in order to further increase the user experiences of the user, the user may customize the arranging information of the IM contacts, the configuration information of the three-dimensional panel and so on, a control panel may be further displayed on the three-dimensional panel, and the user may configure the arranging information of the IM contacts and the configuration information of the three-dimensional panel on the control panel. If control information on the control panel is changed, the three-dimensional panel is restarted according to the changed control information. In this way, the user can change the control information through the control panel to make the three-dimensional panel be displayed according to the demands of the user, thereby meeting the customized demands of the user and increasing the user experiences.<br>
The above is a detailed description of the method for implementing the three-dimensional panel at the IM client provided by the embodiments of the present invention. It should be understood that, in the above embodiments, after the request Information is received, the sequence of performing the steps of obtaining the configuration information, obtaining the identity information, obtaining the group information and obtaining the arranging information is not fixed and may be arranged arbitrarily. Therefore, in the embodiments of the present invention, the sequence of performing the steps of obtaining the configuration information, obtaining the identity information, obtaining the group information and obtaining the arranging information is not limited.<br>
