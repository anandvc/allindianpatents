SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
In the present invention an improved process for the reduction of the ester dione (IV) is described with diborane. A novel combination of solvents, acetone and methanol is used in the preparation of (-) trans carbinol (I) with DPTTA in very high purity and yield. This invention also relates to the recycling of wasteful trans (+) carbinol (la) by novel oxidation &amp; racemization method which uses conventional oxidizing agent.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Paroxetine is prepared by typical process wherein 4- fluro ethyl cinnamate which in turn made from 4-fluro benzaldehyde with the reaction of ethyl acetate and followed by isolation of cinnamate ester which in turn reacted with thionyl chloride and monomethyl amine to generate the 4-fluro N- methyl cinnamate.<br>
i This 4- fluro N- methyl cinnamide is further condensed with expensive base namely<br>
sodium tertiary butoxide and diethyl malonate to generate the ester dione (IV) which in<br>
turn is reduced by BF3 etherate and sodium borohydride to generate the trans(±)racemic<br>
carbinol(Ib). This trans carbinol is separated into the desired isomer the (-) form by<br>
resolution with (L) di-para toluyl tartaric Acid (DPTTA).<br>
The above process generates an important waste, trans (+) carbinol which constitutes a major cost factor and disposal hazard of the toxic enantiomer. WO 9322284 discloses the selective hydrolysis of the desired isomer of a key intermediate by porcine liver esterase enzyme. The enzyme in the desired purity is not available and the acetone extract of the porcine liver leads to poor isomer selectivity thus limiting the scope of invention. The raw material so used by the enzyme route is generated from arecoline which is potentially<br>
6<br><br>
toxic thus limiting the scope of the process proposed to recycle the undesired (+) trans isomer.<br>
The present process discloses the unique potential of reducing the ester dione (IV) by a novel scheme of addition to prevent reductive dehydrogenation leading to the des flurocarbinol(V) by reacting with a pre generated diborane solution in solvents like THF, dioxane, methylal, ethylal to generate the racemic trans carbinol with a much improved quality and yield. The process for preparation of paroxetine and its intermediates which comprises:<br>
a)	reducing the ester dione of formula IV, by reacting with pregenerated<br>
diborane solution in organic solvent to generate the racemic trans carbinol<br>
in an improved quality and yield; and<br><br>
b)	resolving the said racemic trans carbinol with di-para toluyl tartaric acid<br>
(DPTTA) by using a combination of solvent mixture of acetone and<br>
methanol in ratio of 70:30 to 99:1 to give the desired salt of (-) trans<br>
carbinol in high state of optical purity and yield.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of a novel combination of acetone and methanol in ratio of 70:30 to 99:1 and more preferably in the ration of 85:15 to 95:5 of the solvent mix to give the desired salt of (-) trans carbinol (I) with DPTTA in very high state of optical purity and yield.<br><br><br>
This invention also relates to the recycling of the wasteful trans (+) carbinol (la) by a<br>
novel oxidation and racemization methods which uses conventional oxidizing agents such<br>
as Jones reagent and pyridinium chloro chromate.The undesired isomer (la), further leads<br>
to the formation of N-oxide so as to give the trans(+) carboxylic acid (II) in high state of<br>
purity.<br>
A process for recyclisation of  the wasterfuil trans (+) carbinol to (-) carbinol wherein the<br>
said process comprises,<br>
a)	treating the wasteful carbinol with conventional oxidizing agents to form trans carboxylic acid,<br>
b)	esterifying the trans carboxylic acid in ethanol,<br>
c)	racemizing the ester with base at a temperature of 60-120°C to give racemic ester,<br>
d)	adding this ester to any fresh batch of dione ester with calculated additional quantity of the diborane solution to effect the reduction of the ester.<br>
The intermediate (II) is esterified in ethanol and racemized with bases like sodium hydride, sodium rnethoxide, sodium amide, lithium isopropyl amide, potassium methoxide and other strong bases at temperature of 60°C to 120°C and more preferably 60°C to 80°C to give racemic ester(III).<br>
The intermediate (Hi) can also be added to any fresh batch of dione ester (IV) with calculated additional quantity of the diborane solution to effect reduction of the ester.<br>
The racemic ester has hitherto been synthesized from the toxic arecoline route thus can now synthesized and reduced with the diborane solution as said above to the desired racemic carbinol.<br><br><br><br><br>
While the present invention as described above in connection with preferred or illustrative embodiments, these embodiments are not intended to be exhaustive or limiting scope of the invention.

When addition was complete, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour.

Sodium hydroxide solution (50%) was added to the combined acidic extract at temperature 10-15°C and stirred well and extracted thrice with 80 ml of ethyl acetate each. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with 20ml of sodium chloride solution (10%), then with water and separated ethyl acetate layer was distilled out at 45-50°C under reduced pressure varying from 100-20 mm of Hg cooled to 35°C to obtain the title compound (16-17.5 gm).<br>

The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 4-6 hours and then diluted with 40ml of water, made alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution and washed with water. The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min. The separated aqueous layer was extracted thrice with 20 ml of ethyl acetate and the solvent was distilled out under reduced pressure to obtain the title compound.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of (±)-trans-4-(4"-FIuorophenyI) - N-methylpiperidine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (formula III).<br><br><br>
