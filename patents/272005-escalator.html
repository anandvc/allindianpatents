				<td>Description Escalator<br>
The invention relates to a guide system for step rollers and chain rollers of steps of an escalator and a method of installing the guide system, there being provided a single- piece section with areas for guiding the run of the rollers in different planes and with areas for fastening the section onto parts of the truss according to the definition of the independent patent claim.<br>
From patent application DE 103 00 587 A1 a guide system for step/pallet rollers and chain rollers of steps/pallets of an escalator or moving walk respectively has become known. The guide system is formed by a single-piece section with acceptance areas provided in different planes for simultaneous acceptance of the step/pallet rollers and chain rollers.<br>
A disadvantage of the known device is that the disclosed device relative to known devices brings, at best, a simplification of the fastening.<br>
It is here that the invention sets out to provide a remedy. The invention as characterized in Claim 1 provides a solution to avoiding the disadvantages of the known device and creating a multifunctional guide system for step rollers and chain rollers as well as a method of installing the guide system.<br>
Advantageous further developments of the invention are stated in the dependent claims.<br>
Besides guiding the run of the rollers, it is advantageous for the guide system also to fulfill the following further functions: Guidance of the sides of the steps on the lower guide rail, a counterguide of the chain rollers, a splashing-water or all-weather encapsulation, an oil-groove channel or oil-cup channel or oil collecting-cup channel, and a fastening support or fastening accepter and fastening spacer accepter for the support or fastening of the guide system. Despite multifarious functions of the constructionally simple guide system, installation is greatly simplified. Thanks to simple fastening by means of screws or clips, the guide system can be installed without difficulty and in a short time. The guide system can be precisely manufactured from an endless strip of steel plate, and close tolerances maintained, by cold forming with rollers.<br>
With the guide system according go the invention, the distance between the lower and the upper guiderail can be reduced, allowing the bracket plate serving as support, and the truss of the escalator, to be constructed more compactly.<br>
Thanks to the uncomplicated, simple installation procedure of the guide system according to the invention, valuable worktime can be saved. Through its being single-piece and having few fastening parts, its manufacture and production are very economical.<br>
In the description that follows, the invention is explained in relation to an escalator.<br>
The present invention is described in more detail by reference to the attached figures.<br>
Shown are in<br>
Fig. 1<br>
an escalator with balustrade and step band; Fig. 2<br>
a cross section along the line A-A of Fig. 1 with previously known guide systems;<br>
Fig. 3<br>
a cross-section B of Fig. 2 with a guide system according to the invention for the return of the escalator steps; and<br>
Fig. 4<br>
details of the guide system according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an escalator 1 with a glass balustrade 2 with handrail 2.1 and steps 3 that form an endless step band. Running in the transporting direction, the steps 3 transport people and objects and, after reversal, return in the opposite direction with the step surface facing down. <br>
The escalator 1 connects a lower storey El with an upper storey E2, a truss 4 serving as support for the step band and the balustrade 2. The steps 3 are guided in the transporting direction by means of a guide system 10 and in the return direction by means of a guide system 12.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a cross section along the line A-A of Fig. 1 with previously known guide systems 10, 12 provided on each side of the escalator 1 in the sloping part of the escalator 1. A section 5 that is manufactured as a single piece and arranged on the truss 4 has a running surface 5.1 for chain rollers 7 and a running surface 5.2 for step rollers 8. A section 6 of the guide system that is made of two parts and arranged on the truss 4 has a running section 6.1 for the step rollers 8 and a running section 6.2 for the chain rollers 7. Guidance of the side of the step 3 takes place by means of a sliding pin 6.3 that rests on the running section 6.2. Provided for each step 3 is a chain axle 7.2 that imparts movement to the step 3 and that is connected at its ends to chain links 7.1.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross-section B of Fig. 2 with the section 6 according to the invention with the escalator steps 3 on the return run. The conventional two-piece section 6 of Fig. 2 has been replaced by the single-piece section 6 according to the invention. The single-piece section 6 provided on each side of the escalator is supported by bracket plates 4.1 of the truss 4 and guides the rollers 7, 8 on their return run in the sloping part of the escalator 1. The guide system 10 for the transporting run can be constructed similar to the guide system 12 according to the invention for the return run.<br>
Fig. 4 shows details of the section 6 according to the invention as shown in Fig. 3. The single-piece section 6 has several areas with different functions: A running surface 6.1 serves to guide the running of the chain rollers 7. To guide the sides of the steps 3, the sliding pin 6.3 rests on a side surface 6.2. Should the chain rollers 7 leave the running surface 6.1, a first counter-surface 6.8 serves as counter-guide and prevents the chain links 7.1 from being pushed together. Should the step rollers 8 leave the running surface 6.5, a second counter-surface 6.9 serves as counterguide. The single- piece section 6 can only be executed with the first counter-surface 6.8 and without the second counter-surface 6.9. The counter-surfaces 6.8, 6.9 are parts of protective encapsulations 6.4. By means of the encapsulations 6.4, the step rollers 8, the chain rollers 7, the chain links 7.1, and the running surfaces 6.1, 6.5 are protected from dirt, dust, water, snow, salt, objects, etc. For run guidance of the step rollers 8, a running surface 6.5 is provided. An oil collecting channel 6.6 prevents dripping of lubricating oil or lubricating grease. The section 6 rests on bracket plate projections 4.11 and is removably fastened at at least one fastening support 6.7 or at at least one fastening face 6.10 by means of screws or clips to the bracket plate 4.1.<br>
The single-piece section 6 is simple and efficient to install and can be laterally exactly positioned on stops 4.12 of the bracket plate projections 4.11 and thereby accurately adapted and dimensioned to the truss 4.<br>
The single-piece section 6 according to the invention is made and cold-formed from an endless strip of steel sheet, as a result of which the required accuracy of the running surfaces 6.1, 6.5 is assured. With a deformation angle of 90°, for example, the accuracy is ± 0.5°.<br>
With a single-piece section 6, a substantial saving of time and effort for installation and manufacture as well as a considerable cost saving is attainable.<br>
The bracket plates 4.1 that are used can be significantly- shortened which, due to their large number, results in a reduced weight of the truss and an additional cost advantage. The distance between the chain roller axle and the step roller axle in figures 2 and 4 shows the shortening of the bracket plates and is approximately 100- 150 mm. The truss can also be constructed correspondingly less high.<br>
<br>
