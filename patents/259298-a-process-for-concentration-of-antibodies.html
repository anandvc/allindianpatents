				<td>Background<br>
Methods for isolating, purifying, and concentrating biological materials are<br>
known and include, for example, chromatography, ultrafiltration, and lyophilization,<br>
see generally, R. Hatti-Kaul et al., "Downstream Processing in Biotechnology," in<br>
Basic Biotechnology, Chap. 9, pages 187-2II, 2nd ed., Cambridge University Press<br>
(2001), Processes for making concentrated monoclonal antibody preparations for<br>
administration to humans are known, see for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,252,055,<br>
which uses ultrafiltration and which re-circulates the resulting filtrate.<br>
Some challenges associated with available antibody concentration methods<br>
include, for example, low fluxes, long process times, large membrane areas,<br>
mechanical recovery yield and losses, operator-intensive intervention, or handling,<br>
low mass transfer rates, energy inefficiencies, and hydraulic pressure limits on<br>
concentration equipment. These and other challenges can contribute to a high total<br>
cost of manufacture and ultimately higher costs to therapeutic drug consumers.<br>
There is a need for improved processes for preparing highly concentrated<br>
protein formulations, such as liquid antibody preparations and therapeutic products<br>
thereof.<br>
Summary<br>
In general terms, the present disclosure generally relates to processes for<br>
concentrating proteins, such as processes for concentrating an antibody preparation,<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing such a preparation, and there use in human<br>
therapy or animal therapy.<br>
In embodiments the present disclosure provides processes for preparing<br>
highly concentrated proteins, such as antibody preparations; and therapeutic<br>
products prepared by the process, such as therapeutic antibody products.<br>
Accordingly, the present disclosure provides, a process for concentrating proteins<br>
comprising: a first ultrafiltering of a first antibody preparation to provide a second<br>
antibody preparation; a diafiltering the second antibody preparation to provide a<br>
diafiltered intermediate antibody preparation; and a second ultrafiltering of the<br>
diafiltered intermediate antibody preparation to provide a third antibody preparation,<br>
wherein one or more of the first ultrafiltering, the second ultrafiltering, and the<br>
diafiltering are accomplished at elevated temperatures, for example, from about<br>
30°C to about 50°C.<br>
The present disclosure also provides, in embodiments, a process for<br>
concentrating proteins comprising: a first ultrafiltering of a first protein mixture to<br>
provide a second protein mixture; a diafiltering the second protein mixture to<br>
provide a diafiltered protein mixture; and a second ultrafiltering of the diafiltered<br>
protein mixture to provide a third protein mixture, wherein one or more of the first<br>
ultrafiltering, the diafiltering, and the second ultrafiltering are accomplished at, for<br>
example, about 45°C.<br>
The present disclosure also provides, in embodiments, a highly concentrated<br>
antibody composition prepared by the above processes.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
Various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail<br>
with reference to drawings, if any. Reference to various embodiments does not limit<br>
the scope of the invention, which is limited only by the scope of the claims attached<br>
hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to<br>
be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the<br>
claimed invention.<br>
The following are used, unless otherwise described:<br>
"Ultrafiltering," "ultrafiltration," "ultrafiltered," "UF," and like terms refer to,<br>
for example, using synthetic semi-permeable membranes, with appropriate physical<br>
and chemical properties, to discriminate between molecules in the mixture, primarily<br>
on the basis of molecular size and shape, and accomplish separation of different<br>
molecules or accomplish concentration of like molecules.<br>
"Diafiltering," "diafiltration," "diafiltered," "diafiltrating," "DF," and like<br>
terms refer to, for example, using an ultrafiltration membrane to remove, replace, or<br>
lower the concentration of salts or solvents from solutions or mixtures containing<br>
proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, or other biomolecules.<br>
"Transmembrane pressure" or "TMP" refers to the average applied pressure<br>
from the feed to the filtrate side of the membrane calculated as TMP [bar] = [(Pp +<br>
PR )/2] - Pf. where PF is the feed pressure, PR is the retentate pressure, and Pf is the<br>
filtrate pressure,<br>
"Tangential flow filtration," "cross flow filtration," "TFF," and like terms<br>
refer to a mode of filtration in which the solute-containing solution passes<br>
tangentially across the UF membrane and lower molecular weigh salts or solutes are<br>
passed through by applying pressure.<br>
"Antibody" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact<br>
monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g.,<br>
bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody<br>
fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. An antibody is a<br>
protein generated by the immune system that is capable of recognizing and binding<br>
to a specific antigen. Described in terms of its structure, an antibody is a Y-shaped<br>
protein consisting of four amino acid chains, two heavy and two light. In a<br>
simplified model sufficient for this appeal, each antibody has primarily two regions:<br>
a variable region and a constant region. The variable region, located on the ends of<br>
the arms of the Y, binds to and interacts with the target antigen. This variable region<br>
includes a complementary determining region (CDR) that recognizes and binds to a<br>
specific binding site on a particular antigen. The constant region, located on the tail<br>
of the Y, is recognized by and interacts with the immune system (Janeway, C.,<br>
Travers, P., Walport, M., Shlomchik (2001) Immuno Biology, 5th Ed., Garland<br>
Publishing, New York). A target antigen generally has numerous binding sites, also<br>
called epitopes, recognized by CDRs on multiple antibodies. Each antibody that<br>
specifically binds to a different epitope has a different structure. Thus, one antigen<br>
may have more than one corresponding antibody.<br>
The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed<br>
of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains (an IgM<br>
antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional<br>
polypeptide called J chain, and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites, while<br>
secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising<br>
2-5 of the basic 4-chain units along with J chain). In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain<br>
unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one<br>
covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or<br>
more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also<br>
has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the<br>
N-terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for<br>
each of the a and 7 chains and four CH domains for (J. and 6 isotypes. Each L chain<br>
has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain (CO at<br>
its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and the CL is aligned with the first<br>
constant domain of the heavy chain (Cnl). Particular amino acid residues are<br>
believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable<br>
domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site.<br>
For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, seee.g., Basic<br>
and Clinical Immunology. 8th edition, D. Stites, A. Terr and T. Parslow (eds.),<br>
Appleton &amp; Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6.<br>
The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two<br>
clearly distinct types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequences<br>
of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant<br>
domain of their heavy chains (Cn), immunoglobulins can be assigned to different<br>
classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG,<br>
and IgM, having heavy chains designated a, 5, e, 7, and p, respectively. The 7 and a<br>
classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor<br>
differences in CH sequence and function, e.g., humans express the following<br>
subclasses: IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl, and IgA2.<br>
The term "variable" refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable<br>
domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates<br>
antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular<br>
antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed across the approximately<br>
110-amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead, the V regions consist of<br>
relatively invariant stretches called framework regions (FRs) of 15-30 amino acids<br>
separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called "hypervariable regions'<br>
that are each 9-12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and ligJit<br>
chains each comprise four FRs, largely adopting a P-sheet configuration, connected<br>
by three hypervariable regions, which form loops connecting, and in some cases<br>
forming part of, the P-sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain ars<br>
held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the hypervariable regions from<br>
the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodis-s<br>
(see Kabat et al., in Sequences of Proteins oflmmunoloeical Interest. 5th Ed. Public<br>
Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. (1991)). The constaat<br>
domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen, but exhibit<br>
various effector functions, such as participation of the antibody in antibody<br>
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).<br>
The term "hypervariable region" when used herein refers to the amino acid<br>
residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The<br>
hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a<br>
"complementarity determining region" or "CDR" (e.g., around about Kabat residues<br>
24-34 (LI), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the VL, and around about Kabat residues<br>
31-35B (HI), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the VH (see Kabat et al,, supra ) and/or<br>
those residues from a "hypervariable loop" (e.g., around about Chothia residues 26-<br>
32 (LI), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the VL, and 26-32 (HI), 52A-55 (H2) and 96-<br>
101 (H3) in the VH (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).<br>
The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody from a<br>
population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies<br>
comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope(s), except for<br>
possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody, such<br>
variants generally being present in minor amounts. Such monoclonal antibody<br>
typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target,<br>
wherein the target-binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that<br>
includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a<br>
plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example, the selection process can be the<br>
selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones, such as a pool of hybridoma<br>
clones, phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that the<br>
selected target binding sequence can be further altered, for example, to improve<br>
affinity for the target, to humanize the target binding sequence, to improve its<br>
production in cell culture, to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo, to create a<br>
multispecific antibody, etc., and that an antibody comprising the altered target<br>
binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to<br>
polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies<br>
directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a<br>
monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an<br>
antigen. In addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibody preparations are<br>
advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins.<br>
The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained<br>
from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be<br>
construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method, For<br>
example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present<br>
invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including, for example, the<br>
hybridoma method (e.g., Kohler et al, Nature, 256:495 (1975); Harlow et al.,<br>
Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed.<br>
1988); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, 563-<br>
681, (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981)), recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,816,567), phage display technologies (see, e.g., Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-<br>
628 (1991); Marks et al., J. Mol. Biol., 222:581-597 (1991); Sidhu et al., J. Mol.<br>

"Chimeric" antibodies (irnmunoglobulins) have a portion of the heavy and/or<br>
light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies<br>
derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or<br>
subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to<br>
corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to<br>
another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long<br>
as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and<br>
Morrison, etal, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6851-6855 (1984)). Humanized<br>
antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.<br>
"Humanized" forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric<br>
antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human<br>
immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human<br>
immunoglobulins (recipient or acceptor antibody) in which hypervariable region<br>
residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a nonhuman<br>
species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate<br>
having me desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv<br>
framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by<br>
corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may<br>
comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor<br>
antibody, These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance such<br>
as binding affinity. Generally, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially<br>
all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially<br>
all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin<br>
and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin<br>
sequence although the FR regions may include one or more amino acid substitutions<br>
that improve binding affinity. The number of these amino acid substitutions in the<br>
FR are typically no more than 6 in the H chain, and in the L chain, no more than 3.<br>
The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.<br>
For further details, see Jones, et al, Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Reichmann, et d'.,<br>
Nature 332:323-329 (1988); andPresta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (19921.<br>
"Antibody fragments" comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably<br>
the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibod y<br>
fragments include Fab, Fab1, F(ab')2, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodie s<br>
(see U.S. Patent No. 5,641,870, Example 2; Zapata, et al, Protein Ens., 8(10):<br>
1057-1062 (1995)); single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies<br>
formed from antibody fragments.<br>
Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen-binding<br>
fragments, called "Fab" fragments, and a residual "Fc" fragment, a designation<br>
reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L<br>
chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain (VH), and the first<br>
constant domain of one heavy chain (Cal). Each Fab fragment is monovalent with<br>
respect to antigen binding, i.e., it has a single antigen-binding site. Pepsin treatment<br>
of an antibody yields a single large F(ab')a fragment which roughly corresponds to<br>
two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen-binding activity and is<br>
still capable of cross-linking antigen. Fab' fragments differ from Fab fragments by<br>
having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the CH! domain including<br>
one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab'-SH is the designation<br>
herein for Fab1 in which the cysteine residue(s) of the constant domains bear a free<br>
thiol group, F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab'<br>
fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of<br>
antibody fragments are also known.<br>
The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy-terminal portions of both H chains<br>
held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by<br>
sequences in the Fc region, which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors<br>
(FcR) found on certain types of cells.<br>
"Fv" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigenrecognition<br>
and -binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy- and<br>
one light-chain variable region domain in tight, non-covalent association, From the<br>
folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops (3 loops each from<br>
the H and L chain) that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and<br>
confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable<br>
domain (or half of an Fv comprising onlv three CDRs specific for an antigen) has<br>
the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the enlre<br>
binding site.<br>
"Single-chain Fv" also abbreviated as "sFv" or "scFv" are antibody fragments<br>
that comprise the VH and VL antibody domains connected into a single polypeptide<br>
chain. Preferably, the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker<br>
between the VH and VL domains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure<br>
for antigen binding. For a review of sFv, see Pluckthun in The Pharmacology of<br>
Monoclonal Antibodies, vol, 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New<br>
York, pp. 269-315 (1994).<br>
"About" modifying, for example, the quantity of an ingredient in the<br>
compositions, concentration of an active, buffer volumes, diavolumes, pore size,<br>
apparent molecular, molecular weight cut-off, process temperature, process time,<br>
yields, flow rates, pressures, bio-burdens, and like values, and ranges thereof,<br>
employed in the methods of the invention, refers to variation in the numerical<br>
quantity that can occur, for example, through typical measuring and handling<br>
procedures used for making concentrates or use solutions; through inadvertent error<br>
in these procedures; through differences in the manufacture, source, or purity of the<br>
ingredients employed to make the compositions or carry out the methods; and like<br>
considerations. The term "about" also encompasses amounts that differ due to aging<br>
of a composition with a particular initial concentration or mixture. The term "about"<br>
also encompasses amounts that differ due to mixing or processing a composition<br>
with a particular initial concentration or mixture. Whether or not modified by the<br>
term "about" the claims include equivalents to the quantities,<br>
"Consisting essentially of refers to a process of obtaining a concentrated<br>
protein composition or antibody composition that includes the steps and ingredients<br>
listed in the claim, plus other steps and ingredients that do not materially affect the<br>
basic and novel properties of the composition, such as a multiplicity of steps or<br>
buffer media. Ingredients that materially affect the basic properties of the<br>
composition and method of the present disclosure impart undesirable characteristics<br>
including, for example, bio-burden, such as the undesirable toxicity or irritability<br>
associated with contaminants.<br>
The indefinite article "a" or "an" and its corresponding definite article "the"<br>
as used herein is understood to mean at least one, or one or more, unless specified<br>
otherwise.<br>
The present disclosure provides, in embodiments, the abovementioned<br>
processes and the concentrated antibody products thereof.<br>
In embodiments of the present disclosure, the preparative processes and<br>
products thereof can be used in preparing highly concentrated antibody preparations<br>
and similar preparations, such as purifying and concentrating proteins or like<br>
substances from natural or synthetic sources, and which products can be useful for<br>
treating pathological conditions, such as asthma, cancer, psoriasis, inhibiting<br>
angiogenesis, and like pathological conditions.<br>
In embodiments of the above-mentioned process for preparing highly<br>
concentrated antibody compositions of the disclosure, the following further<br>
exemplifies how to make and use the preparative processes and products of the<br>
disclosure.<br>
In embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided a process for<br>
preparing highly concentrated antibody compositions, for example, according to<br>
accomplishing the following steps in the order recited, comprising:<br>
a first ultrafiltering of a first antibody preparation, having a concentration of,<br>
for example, about 0,1 to about 10 grams per liter (g/L), to provide an second<br>
antibody preparation as the retentate, having a greater antibody concentration of, for<br>
example, about 10 to about 50 grams per liter;<br>
a diafiltering of the resulting second antibody preparation to provide a<br>
diafiltered intermediate antibody preparation as the retentate, having about the same<br>
concentration as the resulting second antibody preparation retentate, that is,<br>
diafiltering to accomplish a buffer exchange at constant volume; and<br>
a second ultrafiltering of the diafiltered intermediate antibody preparation to<br>
provide a third antibody preparation as the retentate, having a greater antibody<br>
concentration of, for example, about 150 to about 200 grams per liter.<br>
The preparative processes of the disclosure can further comprise an optional<br>
product recovery step or steps, for example, and as disclosed and illustrated herein.<br>
In embodiments of the above-mentioned process of the disclosure, one or<br>
more of the first ultrafiltering, the diafiltering, and the second ultrafiltering, can be<br>
accomplished at, for example, from about 30 °C to about 70°C. In embodiments,<br>
these steps can also be accomplished at, for example, from about 30 °C to about<br>
50°C. In embodiments, these steps can also be accomplished at, for example, from<br>
about 35 °C to about 50°C. In embodiments, these steps can also be accomplished<br>
at, for example, about 45 °C, such as from about 45 °C plus or minus 5°C.<br>
Depending upon the type of antibody preparation, for processes accomplished at<br>
temperatures above about 70°C, the preparation may show signs of deterioration,<br>
such as denaturation, agglomeration, and like phenomena. For processes<br>
accomplished at temperatures below from about 30 to about 35°C, the flow rates axe<br>
typically undesirably low and process times are undesirably long, making the<br>
process at lower temperatures less attractive for efficient commercial production<br>
In embodiments, the first antibody preparation can have an antibody<br>
concentration of, for example, from about 0.1 to about 100 grams per liter (g/L).<br>
The antibody concentration is, for example, a common concentration typically<br>
available from other preliminary protein or antibody purification steps or methods,<br>
such as, centrifugation, filtration, chromatography, and like procedures. The<br>
resulting second antibody preparation obtainable from the first ultrafiltering can<br>
have an antibody concentration of, for example, from about 10 to about 50 grams<br>
per liter, and for example, about 20 to about 40 grams per liter, such as 30 grams p er<br>
liter. A range for the antibody concentration of the intermediate antibody<br>
preparation can depend upon, for example, a balance of factors, such as sample<br>
volume and sample flux achievable with a particular buffer containing the second<br>
antibody preparation. The intermediate antibody preparation can have an antibody<br>
concentration of, for example, about 25 to about 35 grams per liter and the third<br>
antibody preparation can have an antibody concentration of, for example, from about<br>
170 to about 200 grams per liter. The third antibody preparation, in embodiments,<br>
can have an antibody concentration of, for example, from about 50 to about 250<br>
grams per liter, such as from of about 100 to about 230 grams per liter, and from<br>
about 170 to about 200 grams per liter, such as 185 grams per liter.<br>
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art, upon comprehending the present<br>
disclosure, that the intermediate antibody preparation and third antibody preparation<br>
comprise the same ultra-filtered retentate except for, for example, differences in the<br>
antibody concentration resulting from the first and second ultrafiltering<br>
concentration, and differences in the suspending buffer media resulting from the<br>
diafiltration buffer exchange. Thus, there is little, if any, compositional change,<br>
such as degradation, of the target protein or antibody product, in embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
Conventional ultrafiltration concentration methods can have generally<br>
greater time and lesser through-put inefficiencies having considerably longer process<br>
times such as several days to several weeks, process considerably smaller volumes,<br>
or both.<br>
In embodiments, the protein concentration process of the disclosure can be<br>
accomplished in, for example, from about 1 to 10 hours, preferably in from about 2<br>
to 5 hours, and more preferably in about 3 hours. The preferences favor higher flux<br>
through-put and smaller membrane areas.<br>
In embodiments, the first ultrafiltering can be accomplished, for example, in<br>
about 35 percent of the total process time. Thus, for example, in a concentration ajid<br>
purification process of the disclosure with about 3 hours total process time, the first<br>
ultrafiltering can be accomplished in about 45 minutes. In embodiments, the second<br>
ultrafiltering can be accomplished, for example, in about 15 percent of the total<br>
process time. Thus, for example, in a process of the disclosure with about 3 hours<br>
total process time, the second ultrafiltering can be accomplished in about 15<br>
minutes. The diafiltering can be accomplished, for example, in about 50 percent of<br>
the total process time. Thus, for example, in a process of the disclosure with about 3<br>
hours total process time, the diafiltering can be accomplished in from about 90 to<br>
about 120 minutes.<br>
In embodiments, the first ultrafiltering and the second ultrafiltering can be<br>
accomplished, for example, with an ultra-filter membrane having a nominal pore<br>
size, or molecular weight cut-off, of about 5 to about 50 kiloDaltons. Another<br>
suitable nominal pore size is, for example, from about 10 to about 40 kiloDaltons.<br>
Yet another suitable nominal pore size, or molecular weight cut-off, is about 30<br>
kiloDaltons.,<br>
In embodiments, the first antibody preparation can contain, for example, an<br>
antibody having an apparent molecular weight of, for example, about 100 to about<br>
200 kiloDaltons. hi other embodiments, the first antibody preparation can contain<br>
an antibody having an apparent molecular weight of, for example, about 150<br>
kiloDaltons, such as when the antibody preparation comprises anti-IgE antibodies or<br>
IgE, see for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,172,213 assigned to Genentech, Inc.<br>
Other antibodies suitable for use in the present disclosure include cancer<br>
treating antibodies, see generally, for example: PCT/US02/19592;<br>
PCT/US01/20118; PCT/USO1/25464; PCT/US01/26626; PCT/US02/28859;<br>
PCT/US02/41798; PCT/US02/12206; PCT/US03/11148; PCT/US02/12619; and<br>
PCT/US02/33050. Still other antibodies suitable for use in the present disclosure<br>
include an anti-CD20 antibody and like antibodies including human, non-human,<br>
murine, hybrid, and chimeric forms. See for example U.S. Patent No. 6,582,959<br>
(VEGF) and U.S. Patent Application No. 2002/0122797 Al (human VEOF).<br>
In embodiments, antibodies included within the scope of the disclosure<br>
include hybrid and recombinant antibodies (e.g., "humanized" and "human"<br>
antibodies) regardless of species of origin or immunoglobulin class or subclass<br>
designation, as well as antibody fragments (for example, Fab, F(ab')2&gt; and Fv). See<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Mage and Lamoyi, in Monoclonal Antibody Production<br>
Techniques and Applications, 79-97, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987).<br>
Monoclonal antibodies may also be used and can be isolated from phage<br>
antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al (1991) Nature,<br>
352:624-628 and Marks, et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol, 222:581-597, for example.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies include "chimeric" antibodies in which a portion of the<br>
heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences<br>
in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody<br>
class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or<br>
homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species<br>
or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such<br>
antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,816,567; and Morrison, et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, 81:6851-6855).<br>
Chimeric antibodies can include "primatized" antibodies comprising variable<br>
domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old<br>
World Monkey, Ape etc) and human constant region sequences.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single<br>
antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that<br>
include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each<br>
monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In<br>
addition to their specificity, the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they<br>
may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. Thus, the modifier<br>
"monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from such a<br>
substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies<br>
comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring<br>
mutations that may be present in minor amounts, and is not to be construed as<br>
requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the<br>
monoclonal antibodies for use in the disclosure may be made using the hybridoma<br>
method first described by Kohler &amp; Milstein, Nature, 256:495 (1975), or may be<br>
made by recombinant DNA methods. Other known methods of antibody production<br>
are described, for example, in Coding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and<br>
Practice, 59-103, Academic Press (1986); Kozbor, J. ImmunoL, 133:3001 (1984),<br>
Brodeur, et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, 51 -<br>
63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1987).<br>
Various methods have been employed to produce monoclonal antibodies<br>
(MAbs). Hybridoma technology, which refers to a cloned cell line that produces a<br>
single type of antibody, uses the cells of various species, including mice (murine),<br>
hamsters, rats, and humans. Another method to prepare MAbs uses genetic<br>
engineering including recombinant DNA techniques. Monoclonal antibodies made<br>
from these techniques include, among others, chimeric antibodies and humanized<br>
antibodies. A chimeric antibody combines DNA encoding regions from more than<br>
one type of species. For example, a chimeric antibody may derive the variable<br>
region from a mouse and the constant region from a human, A humanized antibody<br>
comes predominantly from a human, even though it contains nonhuman portions.<br>
Like a chimeric antibody, a humanized antibody may contain a completely human<br>
constant region. But unlike a chimeric antibody, the variable region may be partially<br>
derived from a human. The nonhuman, synthetic portions of a humanized antibody<br>
often come from CDRs in murine antibodies, hi any event, these regions are crucial<br>
to allow the antibody to recognize and bind to a specific antigen.<br>
As noted, murine antibodies play an important role in antibody technology.<br>
While useful for diagnostics and short-term therapies, murine antibodies cannot be<br>
administered to people long-term without increasing the risk of a deleterious<br>
immunogenic response. This response, called Human Anti-Mouse Antibody<br>
(HAMA), occurs when a human immune system recognizes the murine antibody as<br>
foreign and attacks it. A HAMA response can cause toxic shock or even death.<br>
Chimeric and humanized antibodies reduce the likelihood of a HAMA response by<br>
minimizing the nonhuman portions of administered antibodies. Furthermore,<br>
chimeric and humanized antibodies have the additional benefit of activating<br>
secondary human immune responses, such as antibody dependent cellular<br>
cytotoxicity.<br>
An "intact" antibody is one that comprises an antigen-binding variable<br>
region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant<br>
domains, CHI, CH2 and CHS. The constant domains may be native sequence<br>
constant domains (e.g., human native sequence constant domains) or amino acid<br>
sequence variant thereof. The intact antibody may have one or more "effector<br>
functions" which refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region (a<br>
native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region) of an antibod y.<br>
Examples of antibody effector functions include Clq binding; complement<br>
dependent cytotoxicity; Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated<br>
cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e,%,,<br>
B cell receptor; BCR), etc.<br>
Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy<br>
chains, intact antibodies can be assigned to different "classes." There are five major<br>
classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may<br>
be further divided into "subclasses" (isotypes), e.g., IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA,<br>
and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different<br>
classes of antibodies are called a, 6, e, 7, and p., respectively. The subunit structures<br>
and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are<br>
well known.<br>
In embodiments, the first ultrafiltering concentrates the first antibody<br>
preparation to provide the second antibody preparation having an antibody<br>
concentration of about 30 grams per liter, and the second ultrafiltering concentrates<br>
the intermediate antibody preparation (obtained from diafiltering) to provide the<br>
third antibody preparation having an antibody concentration of, for example, about<br>
170 to about 200 grams per liter. The first ultrafiltering and the second ultrafiltering<br>
can be accomplished with the same ultra-filter membrane, and if desired, within the<br>
same vessel or process circuit, for example, to minimize handling, losses, leakage,<br>
and like impacts on yield, efficiency, and economy. The first ultrafiltering and the<br>
second ultrafiltering can be accomplished with any suitable ultrafilter apparatus or<br>
ultrafilter membrane. Many suitable ultrafilter apparatus and ultrafilter membranes,<br>
which are capable of tangential flow filtration (TFF) operation to accomplish the<br>
ultrafiltrations and diafiltration, are commercially available, such as from Millipore,<br>
Pall Corp., Sartorius, and like vendors, In embodiments, a suitable ultra-filter<br>
membrane can be, for example, any regenerated cellulose composite, which<br>
composite has a relatively low protein adsorption profile compared to other available<br>
ultra-filter membranes, such as, polyethersulfone.<br>
The diafiltering operation exchanges a first buffer composition present in the<br>
first and second antibody preparations for a second buffer desired in the third<br>
antibody preparation. In embodiments, the first buffer can comprise, for example, a<br>
mixture of aqueous sodium chloride and a TRIS buffer, and the second buffer can<br>
comprise, for example, a mixture of aqueous histidine chloride and arginine<br>
chloride. The diafiltering can accomplish a buffer exchange at constant volume,<br>
constant concentration, or both. In embodiments, the diafiltering accomplishes a<br>
buffer exchange at constant volume and constant concentration, The diafiltering can<br>
accomplish a buffer exchange, for example, of from about 5 to about 15 fold<br>
volumes (i.e. diavolumes). The diafiltering can also accomplish a buffer exchange,<br>
for example, of about 8-fold volumes (8 diavolumes), that is, 8 times the volume of<br>
the sample containing the antibody preparation to be exchanged. For example, a 10<br>
liter antibody preparation can be diafiltered with a 5 fold (diavolumes) or 50 liter<br>
volume of exchange buffer. The exchange volume and preferences for exchange<br>
volumes considers a balance of factors, for example, process through-put<br>
efficiencies, product purity, governmental and customer-patient acceptability<br>
standards, and like standards, and can depend on, for example, the concentration and<br>
type of buffer (e.g., the first buffer) in the first antibody preparation, and like<br>
considerations.<br>
The first ultrafiltering, the second ultrafiltering, and the diafiltering are<br>
preferably accomplished with tangential flow filtration (TFF mode) across an ultrafilter<br>
membrane, and the ultra-filter membrane is preferably the same membrane for<br>
each step. The yield of product in the final pool (i.e., the third antibody preparation)<br>
can be, for example, greater than about 70 weight percent, such as from about 80 to<br>
about 100 weight percent based on the weight of antibodies in the first antibody<br>
preparation. The yield of the third antibody preparation can be, in embodiments,<br>
greater than about 90 weight %, in embodiments, greater than about 95 weight<br>
percent, and in embodiments, even greater than about 98 weight %, based on the<br>
weight of antibodies in the first antibody preparation.<br>
The first ultrafiltering can have a recirculation rate of, for example, from<br>
about 50 to 1,000 mL/min, and preferably from about 100 to 1,000 mL/min. The<br>
recirculation rate can be scaled in accordance with the available membrane area, for<br>
example, membrane areas of 5,20, 200,1,000 square feet, and like areas permit<br>
increasingly higher recirculation rates. Thus, a suitable scaled recirculation rate, in<br>
embodiments, can be, for example, from about 0,5 L/min/ft2 to about 5 L/min/ft2<br>
The ultrafiltering and diafiltrating can be accomplished, for example, at<br>
transmembrane pressures of from about 5 to about 50 p.s.i. The ultrafiltering and<br>
diafiltrating can be accomplished, for example, at transmembrane pressures of from<br>
about 10 to about 50 p.s.i. In embodiments of the present disclosure there is<br>
provided a process for preparing an antibody concentrate for a more dilute antibody<br>
formulation, the antibody concentrate having a minimum bio-burden, for example,<br>
of less than or under a detectable limit, such as, less than about 100 CFU/mL.<br>
Antibody compositions of the disclosure can be, for example, concentrated<br>
monoclonal antibody preparation for administration to humans, such as at a<br>
concentration of greater than or equal to about 100 g/L (mg/mL), such as about 12O<br>
toaboutl70g/L.<br>
The antibody compositions of the disclosure can be, for example,<br>
immunoglobulins, such as from the group IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM; sub-classes<br>
thereof; recombinants thereof; fragments thereof; and mixtures thereof of any of the<br>
foregoing. A preferred antibody composition of the disclosure includes recombumnt<br>
humanized anti-IgE antibodies. The antibody compositions of the disclosure can<br>
include a buffer. A preferred buffer can be, for example, a mixture of aqueous<br>
histidine chloride and arginine chloride.<br>
The preparative processes of the disclosure are preferably accomplished in<br>
the same apparatus and without operator intervention or with minimal operator<br>
intervention, for example, as illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
The first antibody preparation can be provided or prepared using a variety of<br>
chemical, physical, mechanical or non-mechanical, or biochemical methods, such as,<br>
grinding, ultrasonication, homogenization, enzymatic digestion, solvent extraction,<br>
centrifugation, chromatography, and like methods, and combinations thereof, see for<br>
example, the above mentioned R. Hatti-Kaul et al., "Downstream Processing in<br>
Biotechnology," in Basic Biotechnology, Chap. 9. The third antibody preparation<br>
can be further processes, if desired, using for example, nanofiltration (to remove,<br>
e.g., divalent ions), reverse osmosis (to remove, e.g., monovalent ions), and like<br>
liquid purification methods. The third antibody preparation of the present disclosa/re<br>
can be packaged, stored, or directly used. The third antibody preparation can be<br>
further processed, if desired, using for example, additional concentration steps, sue h<br>
as drying, lyophilization, lyophilization-reconstitution, and like methods. The<br>
resulting concentrated third antibody product can be reconstituted at a later time, :f<br>
desired, with a suitable liquid.<br>
Referring to the figures, FIG. 1 illustrates an apparatus, in embodiments of<br>
the present disclosure, for accomplishing the preparative process including an<br>
ultrafiltration-difiltration system (100) having an TFF ultra-filtration-difiltration<br>
(UF-DF) unit (110), having a UF-DF membrane (115), which is in communicatio.i<br>
with recirculation tank (120) which tank serves as a main feed and retentate<br>
reservoir. In embodiments, tank (120) can have a temperature control system<br>
comprising, for example, an insulating jacket (125), a thermostatic or temperature<br>
controlled heating element (126), such as a rheostat resistive heater element or a<br>
circulating heated liquid system which includes a heater (not shown), a flow<br>
regulator (127), such as a recirculating pump, and a suitable heat transfer fluid, such<br>
as either water, glycols, or mixtures thereof. All in-circuit components or<br>
component contributing to in-circuit flow or processing, such as pipes, valves,<br>
pumps, tanks, and like components, can be optionally insulated or optionally<br>
adapted for external heating to maintain close control over temperature<br>
specifications and to avoid temperature excursions in the recirculating fluid loop<br>
within and between filter chamber (110) and recirculation tank (120). hi<br>
embodiments, for example, when the system (100) is accomplishing the first<br>
ultrafiltration or first ultrafiltering, such as in a fed-batch mode, the system can<br>
include an optional feed tank (128) which is in fluid communication with<br>
recirculation feed tank (120) and can be used to, for example, make-up, replenish, or<br>
supplement the depleted liquid phase from recirculation tank (120).<br>
A pump (130) pumps feed liquid from tank (120) through the UF/DF unit<br>
(110) and thereafter recirculates the resulting retentate (the non-filtered or<br>
membrane excluded portion of the feed liquid) to recirculating tank (120). A second<br>
tank (140) holds and optionally pumps (not shown) a buffer into the main circuit<br>
(110-120 loop) during the constant volume diafiltration. For example, the addition<br>
rate and volume of the buffer introduced into the main circuit is preferably at the<br>
same rate and volume at which filtrate leaves the main circuit through membrane<br>
(115). Buffer tank (140) can be optionally insulated with jacket (143) and can<br>
include the equivalent of the abovementioned heating element and a recirculating<br>
pump (not shown). An optional inert gas source (145), such as nitrogen, or other<br>
compressed gas sources can be used, for example, for product recovery, to<br>
pressurize the retentate return, exclude oxygen, for flushing, for cleaning, for<br>
membrane integrity testing, and like operations. A third tank (160) is used to collect<br>
and recover the filtrate exiting the unit (110). Valves (150,170) can be used as<br>
appropriate to regulate the direction and optionally the liquid flow rate in the system.<br>
All values and pumps can be actuated manually, by coordinated computer control, or<br>
both. An optional forth tank (190) and exit stream can provide an ancillary wasteflush,<br>
product recovery, or monitoring system, for example, when equipped with an<br>
optional monitoring device (180), such as an optical density meter, optional filter(s)<br>
(185) such as a guard filter, product filter, and like optional subsystems. In<br>
embodiments, the main fluid circuit (110-120 loop) can optionally be equipped with<br>
an in-line monitoring system.<br>
The concentrated antibody preparations prepared by processes of the present<br>
disclosure can be used for human therapeutic administration, including<br>
immunoglobulin products, for either intramuscular (IMIG) or intravenous (IVIG)<br>
administration. The concentrated antibody preparations of the disclosure can<br>
include a stabilizer, for example, a buffered amino acid salt solution, simple sugars,<br>
or like stabilizers, suitable ions chelators, such as EDTA or citrate ion, and<br>
combinations thereof, see for example, Wang, Y.-C. J. et al, "Parenteral<br>
formulations of proteins and peptides: stability and stabilizers," J, Parenteral Sci.<br>
Technol, 42, Suppl. S3-S26 (1988). Derwent Abstract of JP01268646A (AN89-<br>
359879) reports that the application describes an injection preparation of an IgG3<br>
monoclonal antibody having a concentration of 0.1 micrograms/mL to 100 mg/mL.<br>
Subject matter disclosed in these publications is believed to be outside the scope of<br>
the present disclosure.<br>
Preparations according to the disclosure can be substantially free from<br>
aggregates. Acceptable levels of aggregated contaminants would be less than, for<br>
example, about 5 weight %, and ideally less than 2 weight %, Levels as low as 0.2<br>
weight % can be achieved, although aggregated contaminants of about 1 weight % is<br>
more typical. The preparation in embodiments, can also preferably be free from<br>
excipients traditionally used to stabilize polyclonal formulations, for example<br>
glycine and/or maltose.<br>
The present disclosure can provide a monoclonal antibody preparation for<br>
administration to a human characterized in that the antibody in the preparation is a<br>
recombinant antibody and can be at a concentration of 100 mg/mL or greater,<br>
preferably greater than 150 mg/mL. The preparation is preferably substantially fre e<br>
from of any protein aggregation.<br>
The pH of pharmaceutical formulations of the disclosure will depend upon<br>
the particular route of administration. However, in order to maximize the solubility<br>
of the antibody in the concentrated solution, the pH of the solution should be<br>
different from the pH of the isoelectric point (pi) of the antibody.<br>
In embodiments of the disclosure, the monoclonal preparation can be<br>
envisaged for use in human therapy. Various human disorders can be treated such as<br>
cancer or infectious diseases, for example, those mentioned above, and immune<br>
dysfunction such as T-cell-mediated disorders including severe vasculitis,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, also autoimmune disorders such as multiple<br>
sclerosis, graft versus host disease, psoriasis, juvenile onset diabetes, Sjogrens1<br>
disease, thyroid disease, myasthenia gravis, transplant rejection, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, asthma, IgE mediated disorders, and like disorders or conditions, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
The disclosure therefore provides in embodiments the use of a concentrated<br>
monoclonal antibody preparation as described herein in the manufacture of<br>
medicament for the treatment of any of the aforementioned disorders, and like<br>
disorders. Also provided is a method of treating a human being, having any such<br>
disorder, comprising administering to the individual a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a preparation according to the disclosure. The dosages of such antibody<br>
preparations will vary with the conditions being treated and the recipient of the<br>
treatment, but can be, for example, in the range of about 50 to about 2,000 mg for an<br>
adult patient preferably about 100 to about 1,000 mg administered daily or weekly<br>
for a period between 1 and 30 days, and repeated as necessary. The doses may be<br>
administered as single or multiple doses.<br>
Process Description. The formulation step typically exchanges the purified bulk<br>
drug substance, for example, resulting from ion-exchange chromatography, into the<br>
final excipient composition and concentration. There was typically no purification,<br>
achieved at this step except for small molecule removal. The emphasis was on higii<br>
yield, buffer exchange, and formulation step robustness. During formulation via<br>
TFF (tangential flow filtration), the protein-containing feed solution was pumped<br>
through the membrane system and back to the recycle (recirculation) vessel. The<br>
TFF membrane retained the protein (as part of the retentate) while the filtrate (or<br>
permeate) was driven through the membrane by pressure. The pressure is called th. e<br>
transmembrane pressure (TMP) and is typically controlled using a retentate pressure<br>
control valve. The process was usually achieved by a sequence of a first<br>
ultrafiltering (concentration), diafiltering (constant volume buffer exchange), and a<br>
second ultrafiltering (further concentration). The number of diavolumes (volumetric<br>
equivalents) necessary to remove process buffer components can be readily<br>
calculated or determined experimentally.<br>
UF/DF Process Generally for anti-IgE. The pH of an anion-exchange pool from<br>
chromatography was adjusted to a pH of about 6 using 0.5 M aqueous phosphoric<br>
acid. The pH adjusted anion-exchange pool was formulated by<br>
ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) process of the present disclosure using a<br>
membrane having a nominal molecular cut off of 10,000 - 30,000 Daltons. Prior to<br>
processing, the UF membrane was equilibrated with diafiltration buffer (0.02 M<br>
histidine, 0.2 M arginine-HCl, pH 6).<br>
The product from an anionic exchange (anion-exchange pool) was then<br>
loaded on the system and was concentrated to an intermediate concentration by the<br>
first ultrafiltering. The pool was then diafiltered (8 X or diavolumes) into its<br>
formulation (0.02 M histidine, 0.2 M arginine-HCl, pH 6). The pool was then<br>
concentrated by a second ultrafiltering to a final bulk concentration of &gt;170g/L and<br>
recovered through a 0,22 micrometer sterile filter. The entire UF/DF process was<br>
performed at a temperature set point of about 45 degrees C. This temperature<br>
control was achieved using temperature control of the incoming anion-exchange<br>
pool, the diafiltration buffer, and the use of a jacketed recirculation vessel for the<br>
UF/DF process as illustrated herein.<br>
After UF/DF, the recovered pool was diluted (i.e., conditioned) to a bulk<br>
concentration of about 150 g/L in 0.02 M histidine, 0.2 M arginine-HCl, 0.04%<br>
polysorbate-20, pH 6 (final formulation). During the conditioning steps the<br>
temperature of the bulk was allowed to return to ambient temperature. After<br>
conditioning, the formulated bulk was again recovered through a 0.22 micrometers<br>
sterile filter.<br>
The UF/DF system can be regenerated with 0. 1 N sodium hydroxide and<br>
sanitized with 1 .4% Minncare.® When not in use the system can be stored in 0. IN"<br>
aqueous sodium hydroxide. The UF/DF membranes can be stored, for example, in a<br>
0.1% Roccal®/20 % glycerol-water solution between campaigns.<br>
General Ultrafiltration/Diafiltration Process Procedures<br>
Operating Parameters: Feed flow rate at 0.5 L/min/ft2. A constant retentate<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples serve to more fully describe the manner of using the<br>
above-described disclosure, as well as to set forth the best modes contemplated for<br>
carrying out various aspects of the disclosure. It is understood that these examples<br>
in no way serve to limit the true scope of this disclosure, but rather are presented for<br>
illustrative purposes.<br>
Example 1<br>
High Concentration Formulation of rhuMAb E25 A pilot scale UF system was<br>
used to concentrate/formulate rhuMAb E25 (a recombinant human monoclonal<br>
antibody that targets IgE, U.S.P. 6,172,213). A Millipore Pelicon Ultrafiltration /<br>
Diafiltration system was assembled with a 5.7-sqft, 10,000-dalton regenerated<br>
cellulose composite membrane. The system consisted of a membrane holder, a<br>
Waukeskaw Model 6 rotary lobe feed pump, Vi" 316L stainless steel recirculation<br>
piping, and a recirculation vessel. Pressure indicators / transmitters (Anderson) were<br>
located at the inlet (FEED), outlet (RETENTATE) and permeate (FILTRATE) of<br>
the membrane holder. Flow meters (Yokogawa ADMAG) were located at the inlet<br>
(FEED) and permeate (FILTRATE) of the membrane holder. A back-pressure<br>
regulating valve (Mikroseal) was located at the outlet of the membrane holder to<br>
control the retentate pressure and effect the transmembrane pressure (TMP). A 40-<br>
liter 316L stainless steel jacketed tank was used for the recirculation vessel. This<br>
tank was fitted with a level indicator, top-mounted agitator (Lightnin), vortex<br>
breaker and bottom valve (NovAseptic). Temperature control was achieved through<br>
the use of temperature modulated glycol fed to the jacket of the tank.<br>
During this run, the feed flow rate was set to a constant rate of 2.85 L/min<br>
(0.5L/min/ft2). During all pre-use and post-use operations the retentate pressure<br>
control was set to a constant of 10 psig, During the ultrafiltering and diafiltering<br>
operations the system used a Cwaii control scheme to control the flux through the<br>
membrane, see for example R. van Reis, et al., Constant Cwaii Ultrafiltration Process<br>
Control, J. of Membrane Science, 130 (1997), 123-140.<br>
Prior to the process, the system storage solution (0.1N NaOH) was flushed in<br>
a single pass to drain mode, first with 2L/ft2 purified water (PW) and then IL/ft2<br>
diafiltration buffer (50 mM Histidine / pH 6.0). After the flushes, the system was<br>
equilibrated by recirculating 0.5L/ft2 diafiltration buffer for 10 min. The pH of the<br>
recirculated solution was checked to confirm the equilibration. The level in the tank<br>
was then reduced to a minimum measurable value to minimize dilution of the<br>
incoming protein pool. The protein pool resulting from a preceding Q-Sepharose<br>
chromatography step was measured to be 3.2 g E25/L and had a volume of 43.1 L,<br>
The protein was in a solution of 25 mM TRIS buffer and about 200 mM NaCl and<br>
pH adjusted to 6.2. To begin the run the protein pool was transferred to the<br>
recirculation vessel. In the vessel the pool was agitated via the top mounted impeller<br>
and the temperature was maintained at ambient (20-25°C).<br>
During the process the pool was concentrated in UF1 mode to 50 g E25/L<br>
(about 2.8L). At the beginning of diafiltration the temperature set point of the<br>
recirculation vessel was increased to 40°C. The increase in temperature and control<br>
was affected by flowing warm glycol through the outer jacket of the tank. The pool<br>
was then diafiltered with 8 diavolumes of diafiltration buffer. The diafiltration was<br>
performed at a constant volume, which was achieved by matching the flow rate of<br>
buffered solution being transferred into the recirculation tank to the flow rate of<br>
filtrate being removed from the system. At the end of the diafiltration, the pool was<br>
further concentrated in UF2 mode. This phase was also performed using an elevated<br>
temperature set point of 40°C. The target for this final concentration was 110 g/L.<br>
This was achieved without the need to reduce the feed flow rate. Next, a low<br>
pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed pump was controlled to<br>
maintain a 5-10 psig pressure drop across the feed channel. A sample was pulled<br>
from the recirculation tank and a final bulk concentration of approximately 120 g/L<br>
was measured. Table 1 summarizes the throughput and flux results of UF1, DF<br>
(DF1+DF2), andUF2.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the observed or measured process values over time for the feed<br>
flow rate (210), tank temperature (220), fed dP (230), TMP (240), and filtrate flov<br>
rate (250) parameters during the various phases or mode of the process including<br>
UF1 (10), DF (20), UF2 (30).<br>
FIG. 3 shows the observed or measured process values over time for the E2 5<br>
concentration (310), flux (320), and TMP (240).<br>
FIG. 4 shows the observed or measured process values over time for pressure<br>
drop versus protein concentration observed for UF1 (410) and UF2 (420) at 37 °C.<br>
The protein pool was recovered by a series of steps. First the pool in the<br>
recirculation tank was pumped from the tank through a Millipac 200,0.22 microns<br>
sterilizing grade filter using the rotary lobe feed pump. Next the protein solution<br>
was displaced from the piping and membrane unit with a 5 psig nitrogen gas blow<br>
down applied to the highest point on the retentate line. The final phase was a blow<br>
down of the tank and feed line, also using die 5 psig nitrogen gas.<br>
The product recovery was believed to be improved compared to Example 1<br>
when conducted at ambient temperature because the elevated temperature used in<br>
one or more of the ultrafiltering, diafiltering, or recovery steps reduced viscous<br>
effects. For example, when the temperature control was turned off during product<br>
recovery, the system slowly cooled during this operation causing difficulties for<br>
recovery from the membrane unit. Alternatively, the recovery can be performed<br>
first from the membrane holder and then from the recirculation vessel.<br>
To determine the mass of loss during recovery, 1.74 L of DF buffer was<br>
added to the system and recirculated for about 5 minutes and recovered using the<br>
same sequence as described above. This volume was then analyzed for protein<br>
concentration with the other pools. Table 2 summarizes the results.<br>
Post processing, the membrane was regenerated using 0.1N NaOH, IL/ft2<br>
single pass flush followed by O.SL/ft2 total recirculation for 30 min. This was<br>
followed by 1 L/ft2 PW (pure water) flush. This was followed by a total recirculati on<br>
of 300 ppm Minncare® solution for 30 min. The system was again flushed with<br>
IL/ft2 PW and finally recirculated for 15 min with 0. IN NaOH and stored. The<br>
recovered pool was diluted to 80 g E25/L and conditioned into the final formulation<br>
of 50 mM histidine /150 mM trehalose / 0.02% polysorbate 20 /pH 6.0. Product<br>
quality was assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for both the incoming<br>
Q-Pool and final recovered bulk. This data is summarized in Table 3.<br>
High Concentration Formulation of rhuMAb E25 at Ambient Temperature<br>
Example 1 was accomplished with the following exceptions. Prior to the process,<br>
the system storage solution (0.1N NaOH) was flushed in a single pass to drain mode<br>
first with 2L/ft2purified water (PW) and then IL/ft2 diafiltration buffer (20 mM<br>
histidine / pH 6.0). After the flushes the system was equilibrated by recirculating<br>
0.5L/ft2 diafiltration buffer for 10 min. The pH of the recirculated solution was<br>
checked to confirm the equilibration. The level in the tank was then reduced to a<br>
minimum measurable value to minimize dilution of the incoming protein pool.<br>
The protein pool resulting from the preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography<br>
step was measured to be 3.3 g E25/L and had a volume of 33.3 L. The protein was<br>
in a solution of 25 mM TRIS buffer and about 200 mM NaCl and pH adjusted to<br>
6.2. To begin the run the protein pool was transferred to the recirculation vessel. In<br>
the vessel the pool was agitated via the top mounted impeller and the temperature<br>
was maintained at ambient (20-25°C). During the process the pool was concentrated<br>
down in UF1 mode to 50 g E25/L (about 2.2 L). The pool was then diafiltered vith<br>
8 diavolumes of diafiltration buffer. The diafiltration was performed at a constant<br>
volume, which volume was achieved by matching the flow rate of buffered being<br>
transferred into the recirculation tank to the flow rate of filtrate being removed fro m<br>
the system. The diafiltration was also performed at ambient temperature. At the end<br>
of the diafiltration, the pool was further concentrated in UF2 mode. The target for<br>
this final concentration was 110 g/L. However, due to a high pressure drop across<br>
the feed channel, this concentration was not achieved. In an attempt to achieve this<br>
concentration the feed flow rate was reduced to 1.4 L/min at a bulk concentration of<br>
about 80 g E25/L because the pressure drop across the feed channel had reached 5 0<br>
psig. UF2 was continued until a high pressure drop of 50 psig again was reached<br>
and the process was stopped. Next, a low pressure drop mixing was attempted<br>
where the feed pump was used to maintain a 5 psig pressure drop across the feed<br>
channel. Again, the viscous nature of the protein solution made it difficult to<br>
achieve since the rotary lobe pump reached excess pressures. A sample was pulled<br>
from the recirculation tank and a final bulk concentration of approximately 104 g/L<br>
was measured. Table 4 summarizes throughput and flux measured during the UF1,<br>
FIG. 7 shows the observed or measured process values over time for pressure<br>
drop versus protein concentration observed for UF1 (410) and UF2 (420) at 24 °C .<br>
The protein pool was recovered in steps. First, the pool in the recirculation<br>
tank was pumped from the tank through a Millipac 200, 0.22 microns sterilizing<br>
grade filter using the rotary lobe feed pump. Next the protein solution was displaced<br>
from the piping and membrane unit with a 5 psig nitrogen gas blow down applied to<br>
the highest point on the retentate line. The product recovery from this was very poor<br>
due to the viscous nature of the solution. The final phase was a blow down of the<br>
tank and feed line, also using the 5 psig nitrogen gas.<br>
To determine the mass of loss during recovery, 1.85 L of DF buffer was<br>
added to the system and recirculated for about 5 minutes and recovered using the<br>
sequence of Example 1. This volume was then analyzed for protein concentration<br>
with the other pools. summarizes the results.<br>
Example 1 was repeated with the following exceptions. The concentrate/formula(Table Removed)<br>
was rhuMAb E26 (a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that targets IgE).<br>
The products from this example were used in toxicology assessment. The Millipore<br>
Pelicon Ultrafiltration/Diafiltration system was assembled with a 11.4-sqft 30,000-<br>
Dalton regenerated cellulose composite membrane. The feed flow rate was set to a<br>
constant rate of 5.0L/min (0.44L/min/ft2). During the ultrafiltration and diafiltration<br>
operations the retentate pressure was maintained between about 6-8 psig. The<br>
protein pool resulting from the preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography step was<br>
measured to be 6.7 g E26/L and had a volume of 59.3 L.<br>
Because the incoming pool was larger then the recirculation vessel, the UF1<br>
process began in fed-batch mode. In this mode, Q-Pool was added to the<br>
recirculation vessel at approximately the same rate as filtrate passes through the TFF<br>
membrane to drain. After the remaining Q-Pool had transferred to the recirculation<br>
vessel, the UF1 process continued in batch mode. During the UF1 the pool was<br>
concentrated to 50 g E26/L (about 7.9 L). At the beginning of diafiltration the<br>
temperature set point of the recirculation vessel was increased to 40°C. The increase<br>
in temperature and control was affected by flowing warm glycol through the outer<br>
jacket of the tank. The pool was then diafiltered with 8 diavolumes of diafiltratioa<br>
buffer. The diafiltration was performed at a constant volume which was achieved by<br>
matching the flow rate of buffered being transferred into the recirculation tank to the<br>
flow rate of filtrate being removed from the system. At the end of the diafiltration,<br>
the pool was further concentrated in UF2 mode to a final concentration of 109 g<br>
E26/L (3.6L). This phase was also performed using an elevated temperature set<br>
point of 40°C. Next a low pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed<br>
pump was controlled to maintain a 5-10 psig pressure drop across the feed channel.<br>

Just prior to product recovery, a 10 mL sample was analyzed for detection<br>
and a titer of bioburden. A typical reject limit is 1,000 Colony Forming Units<br>
(CPU) per mL. The results of this test were 1.8 CFU/mL, a suitable value at this<br>
step and well below the reject limit. To determine the mass of loss during recovery,<br>
908.1 mL of DF buffer was added to the system and recirculated for about 5 minutes<br>
and recovered using the same sequence described above. This volume was then<br>
analyzed for protein concentration with the other pools. Table 8 summarizes the<br>
results.<br>
The recovered pool was diluted to 80 g E26/L and conditioned into the fiaal<br>
formulation of 50 mM histidine /150 mm trehalose / 0.02% polysorbate 20 /pH 5. 0.<br>
Product quality was assessed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) for the<br>
incoming Q-Pool, theretentate pool after UF1, theretentate pool after DF, and final<br>
recovered bulk. This data is summarized in Table 9.<br>
To determine the mass of loss during recovery, 987 mL of DF buffer was<br>
added to the system and recirculated for about 5 minutes and recovered using the<br>
same sequence described above. This volume was then analyzed for protein<br>
concentration with the other pools. Table 11 summarizes the results.<br>

Example 5<br>
Liquid rhuMAb E25 Scale Up Example 1 was repeated with the following<br>
exceptions.<br>
A production scale UF system was used to concentrate/formulate a liquid rhuMAb<br>
E25 (a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that targets IgE). The product caji<br>
be used in therapeutic application and human bio-equivalency trials. The Millipore<br>
Pelicon Ultrafiltration / Diafiltration systems were assembled with a 226-sqft<br>
regenerated cellulose composite membrane, with a pore size of 30,000-Dalton. Each<br>
system consisted of a membrane holder, a Viking S3S rotary lobe feed pump, 1W<br>
316L stainless steel recirculation piping, and a 250-L recirculation vessel.<br>
One 250-liter 316L stainless steel j acketed tank was used for the<br>
recirculation vessel. Temperature control to this tank was achieved with a<br>
temperature modulated glycol fed to the tank's jacket. The temperature of the glycol<br>
fed to the tank jacket was raised or lowered using either steam-fed heat exchanger or<br>
cold glycol supply respectively.<br>
For this run, the feed flow rate was set to a constant rate of 114 L/min<br>
(0.5L/min/ft2). The diaflltration buffer (20 mM histidine 7200 mM arginine chloride/<br>
pH 6.0) was prepared in a separate tank. The temperature of this buffer was set to<br>
45 °C prior to the process. This enabled accurate temperature control throughout the<br>
process.<br>
Prior to processing, the system storage solution (0.1N NaOH) was flushed in<br>
a single pass to drain mode first with IL/ft2 water for injection (WFI) and then IL/ft2<br>
diafiltration buffer. After the flushes, the system was equilibrated by recirculating<br>
0.5L/ft2 diafiltration buffer for 10 min. The pH of the recirculated solution was<br>
checked to confirm the equilibration.<br>
The protein pool resulting from the preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography<br>
step was measured to be 5.2562 g E25/L and had a volume of 1,141 L. The protein<br>
was in a solution of 25 mM TRIS buffer and about 200 mM NaCl and the pH was<br>
adjusted to 6.2. Just prior to the run, the temperature set point of this pool was set to<br>
45 °C. To begin the run the protein pool was transferred to the recirculation vessel,<br>
through a 0.22 microns sterilizing grade filter to a level of about 200 L in the tank.<br>
In the vessel the pool was agitated via a top ndounted impeller and the temperature<br>
was maintained at about (40-50 °C). Because the incoming pool was larger then the<br>
recirculation vessel, the UF1 process began in fed-batch mode. In this mode, QPool<br>
was added to the recirculation vessel at approximately the same rate as filtrate<br>
passes through the TFF membrane to drain. After the remaining Q-Pool was<br>
transferred to the recirculation vessel, the UF2 process was continued in batch mode.<br>
During the UF1 mode the pool was concentrated to about 30 g E25/L (about 200 I_).<br>
The pool was then diafiltered with about 8 diavolumes of diafiltration buffer.<br>
During diafiltration the temperature was maintained between 40° and 50°C. The<br>
diafiltration was performed at a constant volume, which was achieved by matching<br>
the flow rate of buffer being transferred into the recirculation tank to the flow rats of<br>
filtrate being removed from the system. At the end of the diafiltration, the pool was<br>
further concentrated in UF2 mode to a final concentration set point of &gt;170 g E25/L<br>
(35 L). This UF2 mode phase was also performed at an elevated temperature set<br>
point of 45°C+/-5°C. Next, a low pressure drop mixing was performed where the<br>
feed pump was controlled to maintain a 5-10 psig pressure drop across the feed<br>
channel. A sample was pulled and a spec scan was performed to confirm the<br>
concentration prior to recovery. The concentration of this sample was 219 g E25/L.<br>
Table 14 summarizes throughput and flux measured during the UF1, DF<br>
Just prior to product recovery, a 30 mL sample was pulled and submitted for<br>
detection and titer of bioburden. The result was 
was recovered by a series of steps. First, the product was displaced from the<br>
membrane in a single pass mode using 5 L of DF buffer added to the retentate line.<br>
The product was filtered into a recovery tank through a 7.4 ft2, 0.22 microns<br>
sterilizing-grade guard filter followed by a 2 ft2, 0.22 microns sterilizing-grade final<br>
filter. The pool in the recirculation tank was then pumped from the tank using the<br>
rotary lobe feed pump. Next the residual protein solution was displaced from tank<br>
and feed line with a 5 psig nitrogen gas blow down. The final phase was a blow<br>
down of the membrane unit, which now contained mostly DF buffer from the initial<br>
product displacement. This phase also used the 5 psig nitrogen gas applied to the<br>
highest point on the retentate line. The recovered pool was diluted first to about 1 S3<br>
g E25/L using DF buffer. Finally, the pool was conditioned into the final<br>
formulation of 20 mM histidine / 200 mM arginine-HCl / 0.04% polysorbate 20 /pH<br>
6.0. The volumes of the recovered pool, diluted pool, and conditioned pool (Q-pool)<br>
were then each analyzed for protein concentration. Table 15 summarizes the results.<br>

Liquid rhuMAb E25 Preparation Example 5 was repeated with following<br>
exceptions. A production scale UF system was used to concentrate/formulate liquid<br>
rhuMAb E25 (E25, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that targets IgE).<br>
The Millipore Pelicon Ultrafiltration / Diafiltration systems were assembled with a<br>
226-sqft regenerated cellulose composite membrane, with a pore size of 30,000-<br>
dalton. Each system consisted of a membrane holder, a Viking S3S rotary lobe feed<br>
pump, 1 '/z" 316L stainless steel recirculation piping, and a 250-L recirculation<br>
vessel. One 250-liter 316L stainless steel jacketed tank was used for the<br>
recirculation vessel. The feed flow rate was set to a constant rate of 114 L/min (0.5<br>
L/min/ft2). During all pre-use and post-use operations the retentate pressure control<br>
was set to a constant of 10 psig. During the ultrafiltration and diafiltration<br>
operations the system used the Cwaii control scheme to control the flux through the<br>
membrane. The diafiltration buffer (20 mM Histidine /200 mM arginine chloride/<br>
pH 6,0) was prepared in a separate tank. The temperature of this buffer was set to<br>
45 °C prior to the process. This enabled accurate temperature control through the<br>
entire process. The protein pool resulting from the preceding Q-Sepharose<br>
chromatography step was measured to be 5.5438 g E25/L and had a volume of 1,0 82<br>
L. The protein was in a solution of 25 mM TRIS buffer and about 200 mM NaCl<br>
and pH adjusted to 6.2. Just prior to the run, the temperature set-point of this pool<br>
was set to 45°C. To begin the run the protein pool was transferred to the<br>
recirculation vessel, through a 0.22 microns sterilizing grade filter to a level of about<br>
200 L in the tank. In the vessel the pool was agitated via the top mounted impeller<br>
and the temperature was maintained at ambient (40-50°C). Because the incoming<br>
pool was larger then the recirculation vessel, the UF1 process began in fed-batch<br>
mode. In this mode, Q-Pool was added to the recirculation vessel at approximately<br>
the same rate as filtrate passes thought the TFF membrane to drain. After the<br>
remaining Q-Pool had transferred to the recirculation vessel, the UF1 process<br>
continued in batch mode. During the UF1 the pool was concentrated to about 30 g<br>
E25/L (about 200 L). The pool was then diafiltered with 8 diavolumes of<br>
diafiltration buffer. During diafiltration the temperature was maintained between 40<br>
and 50 °C. The diafiltration was performed at a constant volume, which was<br>
achieved by matching the flow rate of buffered being transferred into the<br>
recirculation tank to the flow rate of filtrate being removed from the system. At the<br>
end of the diafiltration, the pool was further concentrated in UF2 mode to a final<br>
concentration set-point of greater than 170 g E25/L (35 L). This phase was also<br>
performed at an elevated temperature set point of 45 °C+/-5 °C. Next, a low<br>
pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed pump was controlled to<br>
maintain a 5-10 psig pressure drop across the feed channel. A sample was pulled<br>
and a spec scan was performed to confirm the concentration prior to recovery. The<br>
concentration of this sample was 191 g E25/L and the pool volume was 31.9 L. A<br>
graph of the process parameters over time were comparable to those observed and<br>
summarized for the above FIG.. 17.<br>
The protein pool was recovered by a series of steps. First the product was displaced<br>
from the membrane in a single pass mode using 5 L of DF buffer added to the<br>
retentate line. The product was filtered into a recovery tank through a 7.4 ft2, 0.22<br>
microns sterilizing-grade guard filter followed by a 2 ft2, 0.22 microns sterilizinggrade<br>
final filter. The pool in the recirculation tank was then pumped from the tank<br>
using the rotary lobe feed pump. Next, the residual protein solution was displaced<br>
from tank and feed line with a 5 psig nitrogen gas blow down. The final phase was a<br>
blow down of the membrane unit, which contained mostly DF buffer from the initial<br>
product displacement. This phase also used 5 psig nitrogen gas applied to the<br>
highest point on the retentate line. The recovered pool was diluted first to about 153<br>
g E25/L using DF buffer. Finally the pool was conditioned into the final<br>
formulation of 20 mM histidine / 200 mM arginine-HCl / 0.04% polysorbate 20 /pH<br>
6.0. The volumes of the recovered pool, diluted pool, and conditioned pool were<br>
then analyzed for protein concentration. Table 15 summarizes the results. Post<br>
process, the membrane was regenerated as described above.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
50 g/L in histidine and Q buffers were kept a various temperatures for 24 hours.<br>
Samples were taken for turbidity measurements and SEC assays. The results of<br>
turbidity versus temperature for E25 at 30 g/L in Q buffer are shown in FIG. 18.<br>
FIG. 19 shows the amount of soluble aggregate of E25 (150 g/L in 50mM histidine<br>
buffer, pH 6.0) observed over time and at temperatures of 23°C, 40°C, 50°C, 60°C<br>
and 70°C. The four time intervals (time of 0 hours, 4 hours, 7.5 hours, and 24<br>
hours) for each of these temperatures is shown as the cluster of four bars from left to<br>
right as 1810 and 1910, in FIGS. 18 and 19. The solution turbidity was essentially<br>
unchanged after 24 hours at 60°C. No significant soluble aggregate of E25 was<br>
observed below 70°C suggesting the product samples were substantially stable up to<br>
at least 60°C and at least 24 hours.<br>
Example 8<br>
Effect of Elevated Temperature on Bioburden E25 samples at 30 g/L in both<br>
arginine and histidine buffers were inoculated with 103 colony forming units per mL<br>
for two challenge organisms: a Gram positive strain (Staphylococcus aureus); and<br>
one Gram negative strain (Pseudomonas chlororaphis). Samples were taken after<br>
1.5 hours and 6 hours. The results shown in the bar charts of FIGS. 20 and 21<br>
indicate that these challenge organisms both decreased with increasing temperature.<br>
The three temperature intervals (temp of 25°C, 40°C, and 50°C hours) for each<br>
observed time interval is shown as the cluster of three bars from left to right as 2010<br>
and 2110, in FIGS. 20 and 21. The inoculations shown were conducted in arginine<br>
buffer with protein concentrations of 30 g/L.<br>
Example 9<br>
Effect of Elevated Temperature on Process Flux E25 samples at 10 g/L in 0.2M<br>
arginine, 25 mM histidine, pH 6.0 buffer were evaluated for their influence on flux<br>
versus transmembrane pressure (TMP). FIG. 22 shows that raising the system<br>
temperature also increased the process flux during the UF/DF operations. Flux<br>
excursions at various bulk concentrations and three different temperatures of 23 °C<br>
(2210), 40 °C (2220), and 46 °C (2230) were performed. The mass transfer<br>
coefficient and filtrate flux increased by about 2 to about 3 fold providing<br>
considerably reduced process times.<br>

High Concentration Formulation of rhuMAB anti-CD20 ("2H7") A pilot scale<br>
UF system was used to concentrate and formulate rhuMAb anti-CD20 (2H7; a<br>
recombinant human monoclonal antibody). Example 1 was repeated with the<br>
following exceptions. The Millipore Pelicon Ultrafiltration / Diafiltration systems<br>
were assembled with a 17.5-sqft, regenerated cellulose composite membrane, with a<br>
pore size of 30,000-Dalton. The system consisted of a membrane holder, a Viking<br>
SI L rotary lobe feed pump, Vtn 316 L stainless steel recirculation piping, and a 40-L<br>
recirculation vessel. Backpressure regulating valves were H.D. Baumann, Inc. The<br>
temperature of the glycol fed the tank jacket was regulated higher or lower as<br>
needed using an electric heat exchanger, a cold glycol supply, or both.<br>
During this run, the feed flow rate was set to a constant rate of 8.5 L/min<br>
(approximately O.SL/min/ft2). FIG, 23 displays the value trends over time for feed<br>
flow rate (210) scaled from 0 to 20, pH (212) scaled from 2 to 12 , filtrate flow rate<br>
(250) scaled from 0 to 5, recycle tank level (2320) scaled from 0 to 45, and retentate<br>
dP (2350) scaled from 0 to 100 during the various phases or mode of the process<br>
including UF1 (10), DPI (20), and UF2 (30),<br>
During the ultrafiltration and diafiltration operations the system used<br>
constant retentate pressure followed by a constant feed/retentate delta pressure<br>
control scheme to control the flux through the membrane, The diafiltration buffer<br>
(30 mM sodium acetate / pH 4.9) was prepared in a separate tank. The temperature<br>
of this buffer was set to 45°C prior to the process for accurate temperature control<br>
through the entire process. Prior to processing, the system storage solution (0.1 N<br>
NaOH) was flushed in a single pass to drain mode first with 1 L/ft2 water for<br>
injection (WFI) and then 1 L/ft2 diafiltration buffer. After the flushes the system<br>
was equilibrated by recirculating 0.5 L/ft2 diafiltration buffer for 10 min, The pH of<br>
the recirculated solution was checked to confirm the equilibration.<br>
The protein pool resulting from a preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography<br>
step was measured to be 2.31 g 2H7/L and had a volume of 356 L. The protein was<br>
in a solution of 6 mM HEPES free acid /19 mM HEPES sodium salt and 25 mM<br>
sodium acetate that had been pH adjusted to 5.3 with 0.5 M acetic acid. Just prior to<br>
the run, the temperature set point of this pool was set to 45°C. To begin the run the<br>
protein pool was transferred to the recirculation vessel through a 0.22 microns<br>
sterilizing grade filter to a level of about 40 L in the tank. In the vessel the pool was<br>
agitated via the top mounted impeller and the temperature was maintained at 40-<br>
50°C.<br>
Because the incoming pool was larger then the recirculation vessel, the UF1<br>
process began in fed-batch mode (see FIG. 23). In this mode, Q-Pool was added to<br>
the recirculation vessel at approximately the same rate at as filtrate passes thought<br>
the TFF membrane to drain. After the remaining Q-Pool has transferred to the<br>
recirculation vessel, the UF1 process continued in batch mode. During the UF1 the<br>
pool was concentrated to about 50 g 2H7/L (about 16 L). The pool was then<br>
diafiltered with 10 diavolumes of diafiltration buffer. During diafiltration the<br>
temperature was maintained between 40 and 50°C. The diafiltration was performed<br>
at a constant volume, which was achieved by matching the flow rate of buffered<br>
being transferred into the recirculation tank to the flow rate of filtrate being removed<br>
from the system. At the end of the diafiltration, the pool was further concentrated in<br>
UF2 mode to a final concentration target set point of 190 g 2H7/L (4.3 L). See in<br>
FIG. 23 the incorporation of constant dP control at 50 psig at the end of this phase.<br>
This phase was also performed at an elevated temperature set point of 45°C+/-5°C.<br>
Next, a low pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed pump was<br>
controlled to maintain a 20 psig pressure drop across the feed channel. A sample<br>
was pulled and a density measurement was performed to confirm the concentration<br>
prior to recovery. The concentration of this sample was 189 g 2H7/L. Table 16<br>
summarizes the throughput and flux results.<br>
The protein pool was recovered by a series of steps. First the product is<br>
displaced from the membrane in a single pass mode using 0.2 L of DF buffer added<br>
to the retentate line. The product is filtered into a recovery tank through a 0.22<br>
microns sterilizing-grade final filter. The pool in the recirculation tank was then<br>
pumped from the tank using the rotary lobe feed pump. Next, the residual protein<br>
solution is displaced from tank and feed line with a 5 psig nitrogen gas blow down.<br>
The final phase was a blow down of membrane unit, which now contains DF buffer<br>
from the initial product displacement. This phase also used the 5 psig nitrogen gas<br>
applied to the highest point on the retentate line.<br>
If necessary, the recovered pool was diluted first to about 175 g 2H7/L using<br>
dilution buffer (30 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.3). Finally, the pool is diluted down to<br>
a target concentration of 150 g 2H7/L and conditioned into the final formulation of<br>
30 mM sodium acetate, 7% trehalose, 0.03% polysorbate 20, pH 5, via a 7 X<br>
conditioning buffer (30 mM sodium acetate, 49% trehalose, 0.21% polysorbate 20,<br>
pH 5.3).<br>
The volumes of the recovered pool, diluted pool, and conditioned pool were then<br>
analyzed for protein concentration. Table 17 presents the results,<br>
High Concentration Formulation of rhuMAb anti-CD20 A pilot scale UF<br>
system was used to concentrate and formulate rhuMAb anti-CD20 (2H7) for use in a<br>
human phase I clinical study in a GMP manufacturing facility. Example 10 was<br>
repeated with the following exceptions.<br>
The protein pool resulting from a preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography<br>
step was measured to be 3,729 g 2H7/L and had a volume of 262 L. The protein<br>
was in a solution of 6 mM HEPES free acid / 19 mM HEPES sodium salt and 25<br>
mM sodium acetate that had been pH adjusted to 5.3 with 0.5 M acetic acid. Just<br>
prior to the run, the temperature set point of this pool was set to 45°C. To begin the<br>
run the protein pool was transferred to the recirculation vessel through a 0,22<br>
microns sterilizing grade filter to a level of about 40 L in the tank. In the vessel the<br>
pool was agitated via the top mounted impeller and the temperature was maintained<br>
at 40-50°C.<br>
During the UF1 the pool was concentrated to about 50 g 2H7/L (about 20 L).<br>
FIG. 24 displays the value trends over time for recycle tank level (210) scaled from -<br>
0.713963 to 295.989, retentate dP (2420) scaled from -0.237899 to 98.6629, feed<br>
flow rate (250) scaled from -0.356981 to 147.994, and filtrate flow rate (2450)<br>
scaled from -0.118994 to 49.3315 during the process. The pool was then diafiltered<br>
with 10 diavolumes of diafiltration buffer. During diafiltration the temperature was<br>
maintained between 40 and 50°C. The diafiltration was performed at a constant<br>
volume, which was achieved by matching the flow rate of buffer being transferred<br>
into the recirculation tank to the flow rate of filtrate being removed from the system.<br>
At the end of the diafiltration, the pool was further concentrated in UF2 mode to a<br>
final concentration target set point of 190 g 2H7/L (5.25 L). Note in FIG. 24 the<br>
incorporation of constant dP to 40 psig control at the end of this phase. This phase<br>
was also performed at an elevated temperature set point of 45°C +/-5°C. Next, a low<br>
pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed pump is controlled to maintain<br>
a 20 psig pressure drop across the feed channel. A sample was pulled and a density<br>
measurement was performed to confirm the concentration prior to recovery. The<br>
concentration of this sample was 194 g 2H7/L. Table 18 summarizes the throughput<br>
and flux results.<br>
High Concentration Formulation of rhuMAb anti-CD20 GMP Example 11<br>
was repeated with the following exceptions. The protein pool resulting from a<br>
preceding Q-Sepharose chromatography step was measured to be 5.106 g 2H7/L and<br>
had a volume of 196 L. The protein was in a solution of 6 mM HEPES free acid /<br>
19 mM HEPES sodium salt and 25 mM sodium acetate that had been pH adjusted to<br>
5.3 with 0.5 M acetic acid. Just prior to the run, the temperature setpoint of this pool<br>
was set to 45°C. To begin the run the protein pool was transferred to the<br>
recirculation vessel through a 0.22 microns sterilizing grade filter to a level of about<br>
40 L in the tank. In the vessel the pool was agitated via the top mounted impeller<br>
and the temperature was maintained at 40-50°C.<br>
During the UF1 the pool was concentrated to about 50 g 2H7/L (about 20 L).<br>
FIG. 25 displays the value trends over time for recycle tank level (210) scaled from<br>
0 to 300, retentate dP (2520) scaled from 0 to 100, feed flow rate (250) scaled from<br>
0 to 150, and filtrate flow rate (2550) scaled from 0 - 50 during the process. The<br>
pool was diafiltered with 10 diavolumes (10 X) of diafiltration buffer. During<br>
diafiltration the temperature was maintained between 40 and 50°C. The diafiltration<br>
was performed at a constant volume that was achieved by matching the flow rate of<br>
buffer being transferred into the recirculation tank to the flow rate of filtrate being<br>
removed from the system. At the end of the diafiltration, the pool was further<br>
concentrated in UF2 mode to a final concentration target setpoint of 190 g 2H7/L<br>
(5.26 L) again utilizing constant dP control at the very end of this phase (see FIG.<br>
25). This phase was also performed at an elevated temperature set point of 45°C+/-<br>
5°C. Next, a low pressure drop mixing was performed where the feed pump is<br>
controlled to maintain a 20 psig pressure drop across the feed channel. A sample<br>
was pulled and a density measurement was performed to confirm the concentration<br>
prior to recovery. The concentration of this sample was 191 g 2H7/L. Table 20<br>

Just prior to product recovery, a 30 mL sample was pulled and submitted for<br>
detection and titer of bioburden. The results were negative (i.e., 
The protein pool was recovered by a series of steps as in Example 11. The volumes<br>
