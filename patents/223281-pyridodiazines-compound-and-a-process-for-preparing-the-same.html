PYRIDODIAZINES AS PLANT FUNGICIDES<br>
This invention relates to novel derivatives of pyridopyrazines and pyridopyridazines, to processes for preparing them, to certain intermediate chemicals used in their manufacture,   to compositions containing them and to methods of using them to combat fungi, especially fungal infections of plants.<br>
Derivatives of the nitrogen-containing 5,6 ring system s--,2,4-triazolo[l,5-a1pyri-midine are known from the patent literature as being useful for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. Examples of recent patent publications include EP-A-1249452, WO 02/051845, WO 02/083676, WO 02/083677, WO 02/088125, WO 02/088126, WO 02/088127. Condensed nitrogen heterocycles used as antimycotics are known from US 5821244. Derivatives of pyridopyrazines are known in the chemical literature, for example from J. Med Chem. (1968), 11(6), 1216-18, J. Med. Chem. (1970), 13(5), 853-7 and US 3984412, but not for agrochemical purposes.<br>
The present invention is concerned with the provision of novel pyridopyrazines and pyridopyridazines for combating phytopathogenic diseases on plants and harvested food crops.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a compound of the general formula (1):<br><br><br>
that not both R3 and R4 are H or NR5R6, or<br>
R3 and R4 together foR"" a C3-7 alkylene or C3.7 alkenylene chain optionally substituted with  one or more C1-4alkyl or C1-4alkoxy groups, or,<br>

C3-8 cycloalkyl,C3-8 cycloalkyl(C1-6)alkyl, heteroaryl or heteroaryl(C1-8)alkyl;<br>
any of the foregoing alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or cycloalkyl groups or moieties (other than for<br>
R ) being optionally substituted with halogen, cyano, Cj-e alkoxy, C1-6alkylcarbonyl,<br>
C1-6alkoxycarbonyl, C1-6 haloalkoxy, C1-6 alkylthio, tri(CM)alkylsilyl, C1-6 alkylamino or<br>
C1-6 dialkylamino,<br>
any of the foregoing morpholine, thiomorpholine, piperidine, piperazine and pyrrolidine<br>
rings being optionally substituted with C1-4alkyl (especially methyl), and<br>

The compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and may exist as enantiomers (or as pairs of diastereoisomers) or as mixtures of such. They may also exist as diastereoisomers by virtue of restricted rotation about a bond. However, mixtures of enantiomers or diastereoisomers may be separated into individual isomers or isomer pairs, and this invention embraces such isomers and mixtures thereof in all proportions. It is to be expected that for any given compound, one isomer may be more fungicidally active than another.<br>
Except where otherwise stated, alkyl groups and alkyl moieties of alkoxy, alkylthio, etc., contain from 1 to 8, suitably from 1 to 6 and typically from 1 to 4, carbon atoms in the foR"" of straight or branched chains.

Except where otherwise stated, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties also contain from 2 to 8, suitably from 2 to 6 and typically from 2 to 4, carbon atoms in the foR"" of straight or branched chains. Examples are allyl, 2-methylallyl and propargyl. Optional substituents include halo, typically fluoro. An example of halo-substituted alkenyl is 3,4,4-trifluoro-n-butenyl.<br>

Compounds of general foR""ula (5) can be prepared by treating compounds of general foR""ula (4) with a base such as sodium hydride, optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid such as magnesium oxide, in a suitable solvent such as N, N-dimethylfoR""amide (DMF) or toluene, at between room temperature and 150°C, but preferably at 60-90°C. Compounds of general foR""ula (6) can be prepared by reaction of compounds of general foR""ula (5) with a chlorination reagent such as phosphorus oxychloride, either neat or in a suitable solvent such as toluene, at between 50 and 150°C, but preferably between 80 and 110°C, or in a microwave reactor at between 150 and 300°C, but preferably between 200 and 250°C Compounds of foR""ula (7) and (8) can be prepared by reaction of compounds of general<br>

foR""ula (6) with an amine R R NH, either neat, or in a suitable solvent such as DMF,<br><br>
between room temperature and 150°C, but preferably between 50 and 80°C. If compounds<br>
(7)	and (8) are produced as a mixture they can be separated by suitable means such as<br>
crystallisation or chromatography under noR""al or reverse phase conditions.<br>
Compounds of the general foR""ulae (5), (6), (7) and (8) may be derivatised, via the chloro or hydroxy substituents, using routine chemical techniques to foR"" other compounds of the general foR""ula (1).

Compounds of general foR""ula (10) can be prepared from compounds of general foR""ula (9), which are either commercially available or made by methods known in the literature, by reaction with acids of general foR""ula β), using standard coupling methods, for example by conversion to the acid chloride using a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride, followed by reaction of the resultant acid chloride optionally in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene.

The aldehyde or ketone is chosen so that the desired groups R3 and R4 are foR""ed after reduction of the product of reaction with the amine (12). For example if compounds of foR""ula (12) are reacted with one equivalent of propionaldehyde and then sodium borohydride, compounds of foR""ula (7) where R is n-propyl, and R4 is hydrogen are foR""ed. If required, the reaction can be repeated with a different aldehyde or ketone.

A compound of foR""ula (1) may move acropetally, basipetally or locally in plant tissue to be active against one or more fungi. Moreover, a compound of foR""ula (1) may be volatile enough to be active in the vapour phase against one or more fungi on the plant.<br>
The invention therefore provides a method of combating or controlling phytopatho-genic fungi which comprises applying a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of foR""ula (1), or a composition containing a compound of foR""ula (1), to a plant, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed or to soil or any other plant growth medium, e.g. nutrient solution.<br>
The teR"" "plant" as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. FurtheR""ore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes protectant, curative, systemic, eradicant and antisporulant treatments.<br>
The compounds of foR""ula (1) are preferably used for agricultural, horticultural and turfgrass purposes in the foR"" of a composition.<br>
In order to apply a compound of foR""ula (1) to a plant, to a seed of a plant, to the locus of the plant or seed or to soil or any other growth medium, a compound of foR""ula (1) is usually foR""ulated into a composition which includes, in addition to the compound of foR""ula (1), a suitable inert diluent or carrier and, optionally, a surface active agent (SFA). SFAs are chemicals that are able to modify the properties of an interface (for example, liquid/solid, liquid/air or liquid/liquid interfaces) by lowering the interfacial tension and thereby leading to changes in other properties (for example dispersion, emulsification and wetting). It is preferred that all compositions (both solid and liquid foR""ulations) comprise, by weight, 0.0001 to 95%, more preferably 1 to 85%, for example 5 to 60%, of a compound of foR""ula (1). The composition is generally used for the control of fungi such that a<br><br>
compound of foR""ula (1) is applied at a rate of from 0.1 g to 10kg per hectare, preferably from lg to 6kg per hectare, more preferably from lg to 1kg per hectare.<br>
When used in a seed dressing, a compound of foR""ula (1) is used at a rate of O.OOOJg to lOg (for example 0.00lg or 0.05g), preferably 0.005g to lOg, more preferably 0.005g to 4g, per kilogram of seed.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of foR""ula (1) and a suitable carrier or diluent therefor.<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling fungi at a locus, which comprises treating the fungi, or the locus of the fungi with a fungicidally effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of foR""ulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates"(DC), emulsions (both oil in water (EW) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke foR""ulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment foR""ulations. The foR""ulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and inorganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to a fine powder.<br>
Soluble powders (SP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with C3-6one or more water-soluble inorganic salts (such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate or magnesium sulphate) or one or more water-soluble organic solids (such as a polysaccharide) and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of said agents to improve water dispersibility/solubility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water soluble granules (SG).<br>
Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents or carriers, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or<br><br>
more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be foR""ed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of foR""ula (1) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-foR""ed blank granules by absorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketones and esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in water or an organic solvent, sych as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contain a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents). Suitable organic solvents for use in ECs include aromatic hydrocarbons (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes, exemplified by SOLVESSO 100, SOLVESSO 150 and SOLVESSO 200; SOLVESSO is a Registered Trade Mark), ketones (such as cyclohexanone or methylcyclo-hexanone), alcohols (such as benzyl alcohol, furfuryl alcohol orbutanol), N-alkylpyr-rolidones (such as Ar-methylpyrrolidone or N-octylpyrrolidone), dimethyl amides of fatty acids (such as C8-C10 fatty acid dimethylamide) and chlorinated hydrocarbons. An EC product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient stability to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtaining a compound of foR""ula (1) either as a liquid (if it is net a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70°C) or in solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifying the resultant liquid<br><br>
or solution into water containing one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an<br>
emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons<br>
(such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes)    <br>
and other appropriate organic solvents that have a low solubility in water.<br>
	Microemulsions (ME) may be prepared by mixing water with a blend of one or more<br>
solvents with one or more SFAs, to produce spontaneously a theR""odynamically stable isotropic liquid foR""ulation. A compound of foR""ula (1) is present initially in either the water or the solvent/SFA blend. Suitable solvents for use in MEs include those hereinbefore described for use in in ECs or in EWs. An ME may be either an oil-in-water or a water-in-oil system (which system is present may be deteR""ined by conductivity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same foR""ulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remaining as a microemulsion or foR""ing a conventional oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions of finely divided insoluble solid particles of a compound of foR""ula (1). SCs may be prepared by ball or bead milling the solid compound of foR""ula (1) in a suitable medium, optionally with one or more dispersing agents, to produce a fine particle suspension of the compound. One or more wetting agents may be included in the composition and a suspending agent may be included to reduce the rate at which the particles settle. Alternatively, a compound of foR""ula (1) may be dry milled and added to water, containing agents hereinbefore described, to produce the desired end product.<br>
Aerosol foR""ulations comprise a compound of foR""ula (1) and a suitable propellant (for example ^-butane). A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be dissolved or dispersed in a suitable medium (for example water or a water miscible liquid, such as rc-propanol) to provide compositions for use in non-pressurised, hand-actuated spray pumps.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to foR"" a composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke containing the compound.<br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW foR""ulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and contains a compound of foR""ula (1) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell may be produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a<br><br>
coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of foR""ula (1) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of foR""ula (!) may also be foR""ulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additives to improve the biological perfoR""ance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rain on treated surfaces; or uptake or mobility of a compound of foR""ula (1)). Such additives include surface active agents, spray additives based on oils, for example certain mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other bio-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may aid or modify the action of a compound of foR""ula (1)).<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be foR""ulated for use as a seed treatment, for example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS, SS, WS, FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively, DP, SP, WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-foR""ing barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be SFAs of the cationic, anionic, amphoteric or non-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.<br>
Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds (for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, calcium dodecyl-benzenesulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate and mixtures of sodium di-isopropyl- and tri-/sc,propyl-naphthalene sulphonates), ether sulphates, alcohol ether sulphates (for example sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium laureth-3-carboxylate), phosphate esters (products from the reaction between one or more fatty alcohols and phosphoric acid (predominately mono-esters) or phosphorus pentoxide (predominately di-esters), for example the reaction between lauryl alcohol and tetraphosphoric acid; additionally these<br><br>
products may be ethoxylated), sulphosuccinamates, paraffin or olefine sulphonates, taurates and lignosulphonates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the amphoteric type include-betaines, propionates and glycinates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the non-ionic type include condensation products of alkylene oxides, such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide or mixtures thereof, with fatty alcohols (such as oleyl alcohol or cetyl alcohol) or with alkylphenols (such as octylphenol, nonylphenol or octylcresol); partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids or hexitol anhydrides; condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide; block polymers (comprising ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); alkanolamides; simple esters (for example fatty acid polyethylene glycol esters); amine oxides (for example lauryl dimethyl amine oxide); and lecithins.<br>
Suitable suspending agents include hydrophilic colloids (such as polysaccharides, polyvinylpyrrolidone or sodium carboxymethylcellulose) and swelling clays (such as bentonite or attapulgite).<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be applied by any of the known means of applying fungicidal compounds. For example, it may be applied, foR""ulated or unfoR""ulated, to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic culture systems), directly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste foR""ulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the foR"" of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient, the concentrate being added to water before use. These concentrates, which may include DCs, SCs, ECs. EWs, MEs SGs, SPs, WPs, WGs and CSs, are often required to withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to foR"" aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may<br><br>
contain varying amounts of a compound of foR""ula (1) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable foR""ulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contain up to 25% by weight of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and a compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological activity, for example micronutrients or compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidal, insecticidal, nematicidal or acaricidal activity.<br>
By including another fungicide, the resulting composition may have a broader spectrum of activity or a greater level of intrinsic activity than the compound of foR""ula (1) alone. Further the other fungicide may have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compound of foR""ula (1) may be the sole active ingredient of the composition or it may be admixed with one or more additional active ingredients such as a pesticide, fungicide, synergist, herbicide or plant growth regulator where appropriate. An additional active ingredient may: provide a composition having a broader spectrum of activity or increased persistence at a locus; synergise the activity or complement the activity (for example by increasing the speed of effect or overcoming repellency) of the compound of foR""ula (1); or help to overcome or prevent the development of resistance to individual components. The particular additional active ingredient will depend upon the intended utility of the composition.<br>

The compounds of foR""ula (1) may be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed-borne, soil-borne or foliar fungal diseases.<br>
Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients, which have significantly different physical, chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional foR""ulation type. In these circumstances other foR""ulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) foR""ulation.<br>
The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which the following abbreviations are used:<br><br><br><br>
Step 1<br>
Methyl 2-amino-3-pyrazine carboxylate (2.2 g) was dissolved in dry DC1-4(20 ml) to give a cloudy pale yellow solution, and pyridine (2 ml) in dry DC1-4(12 ml) was added. The stirred suspension was cooled in an ice bath, and 2,4,6-trifluorophenylacetyl chloride β.0 g) in dry DC1-4(13 ml) was added dropwise. The reaction gradually became a deep orange, and then went clear. It was stirred for 6 hours and stood overnight. The reaction mixture was washed with water, brine, and then dilute hydrochloric acid, and the DC1-4layer was dried over magnesium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated to yield an orange solid which was triturated with ether, to give methyl 2-[2,4,6-trifluorophenylacetylamino1-3-pyrazine carboxylate as a yellow solid (1.5 g).<br>

The product of Step 1 β.25 g) was dissolved in DMF (10ml) and added dropwise to a stirred suspension of sodium hydride (0.60 g of an 80% dispersion in mineral oil) in DMF (80 mJ). There was an immediate reaction, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, and at 80°C for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and evaporated to give a yellow solid β g), which was then acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid. The resultant white suspension was filtered and collected, washed with ether and dried to give 6,8-dihydroxy-7-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)pyrido[2,3-b1pyrazine (1.8 g). 1H NMR (d6-DMSO) 5 ppm: 7.25 (t,2H), 8.6 (fd,lH),8.7 (fd,lH), 12.6 (s,lH). Step 3<br>
The product from Step 2 (0.90 g) was added portion-wise to phosphorus oxychloride (10 ml) with stirring. The reaction was exotheR""ic. The mixture became brown with a fine suspension, and was then refluxed for 6 hours. Excess phosphorus oxychloride was evaporated, the mixture was diluted with DC1-4, and then washed with water to give a black<br><br>
oil, which was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel (40-60) eluting with diethyl ether, to give 6,8-dichloro-7-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)pyrido[2,3-b1pyrazine as a dark oil (0.40g).	<br><br>
maintained at a temperature between 79°- 81°C. Stirring was continued at this temperature for 3 hours, and the reaction was then cooled. The mixture was poured carefully into saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (500 ml) keeping the temperature below 30 °C. After stirring for 20 minutes the product was extracted with ethyl acetate, washed with water and brine and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated to yield a dark red oil, which was purified by flash chromatography eluting with cyclohexanerethyl acetate, 4:1 to give 6,8-dichloro-7-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)pyrido[2,3-b1pyrazine as a light brown solid (7.5 g),m.p. 139-141 °C<br><br>
A fraction containing a mixture of isomers (0.080 g), was obtained, and a portion of this mixture (0.020g) was purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Kromasil 100-5C18 column, eluting with methanol:water (65:35) to give [6-chloro-7-(2,4,6-trifluorophenyl)-pyrido[2,3-b1pyrazin-8-yl1-isopropylamine as a frothy solid (0.013 g).<br>
