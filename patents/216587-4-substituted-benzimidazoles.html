Particularly preferred are the compounds given as final products of formula 1 in the examples, and the salts of these compounds. The compounds according to the invention can be synthesised from corresponding starting compounds, for example according to the reaction schemes given below. The synthesis is carried out in a manner known to the expert, for example as described in more detail in the following examples. The starting compounds are known, for example from M. W. Lovell, S. G. Schulman, Anal. Chem. 1983, 55, 963-965 (e. g. 4-bromo^-nitro-1,2-phenylenediamine). 6-Halo,4-nitro-substituted benzimidazoles are known in literature, for example 6-chloro-2-methyl4-nitro-1(3)H-benzimidazole (Gillespie et al., J, Org.

The reaction steps outlined above are carried out in a manner known per se, e. g. as described in more detail in the examples. The derivatization, if any, of the compounds obtained according to the above Scheme 1 and 2 (e.g. conversion of a group R3 into another group R3, or of R2 = H into another group R2, or conversion of the hydroxyl group into an alkoxy or ester group) is likewise carried out in a manner known per se. If compounds where R3 = -CO-1-4C-alkoxy or R3 = -CO-NR31R32 are desired, an appropriate derivatization can be performed in a manner known per se (e. g. metal catalysed carbonylation of the corresponding bromo compound or conversion of an ester into an amide) at the stage of trie benzimidazoles of formula I (scheme 1 and 2) or more conveniently at a later point in time.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention in greater detail without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula 1 whose preparation is not described explicitly can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques. The abbreviation min stands for minute(s), h for hour(s) and m.p. for melting point. Examples [.Starting materials<br>

The compounds of the formula 1 and 2 and their salts have valuable pharmacological properties which make them commercially utilizable. In particular, they exhibit marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action in warm-blooded animals, in particular humans, in this<br>
23<br><br>
connection, the compounds according to the invention are distinguished by a high selectivity of action, an advantageous duration of action, a particularly good enteral activity, the absence of significant side effects and a large therapeutic range.<br>
"Gastric and intestinal protection" in this connection is understood as meaning the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, in particular of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions (such as, for example, gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastritis, hyperacids or medicament-related functional dyspepsia), which can be caused, for example, by microorganisms (e.g. Helicobacter pylori), bacterial toxins, medicaments (e.g. certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics), chemicals (e.g. ethanol), gastric acid or stress situations.<br>
In their excellent properties, the compounds according to the invention surprisingly prove to be clearly superior to the compounds known from the prior art in various models in which the antiulcerogenic and the antisecretory properties are determined. On account of these properties, the compounds of the formula 1 and 2 and their pharmacologically acceptable salts are outstandingly suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, where they are used, in particular, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders of the stomach and/or intestine.<br>
A further subject of the invention are therefore the compounds according to the invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention likewise includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the production of medicaments which are employed for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases.<br>
The invention furthermore includes the use of the compounds according to the invention for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the abovementioned diseases. A further subject of the invention are medicaments which comprise one or more compounds of the formula 1 and/or their pharmacologically acceptable salts. The medicaments are prepared by processes which are known perse and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As medicaments, the pharmacologically active compounds according to the invention (= active compounds) are either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries or excipients in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches (e.g. as TTS), emulsions, suspensions or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95% and it being possible to obtain a pharmaceutical administration form exactly adapted to the active compound and/or to the desired onset and/or duration of action (e.g. a sustained-release form or an enteric form} by means of the appropriate selection of the auxiliaries and excipients.<br>
The auxiliaries and excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical formulations are known to the person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge.

Methodology<br>
The abdomen of anesthetized rats (CD rat, female, 200-250 g; 1.5 g/kg i.m. urethane) was opened after tracheotomy by a median upper abdominal incision and a PVC catheter was fixed transorally in the esophagus and another via the pylorus such that the ends of the tubes just projected into the gastric lumen. The catheter leading from the pylorus led outward into the right abdominal wall through a side opening.<br>
After thorough rinsing (about 50-100 ml}, warm (37°C) physiological NaCI solution was continuously passed through the stomach (0.5 ml/min, pH 6.8-6.9; Braun-Unita I}. The pH (pH meter 632, glass electrode EA147; <fr mm metrohm and by titration with a freshly prepared naoh solution to ph the secreted hci were determined in effluent each case collected at an interval of minutes.></fr>
The gastric secretion was stimulated by continuous infusion of 1 ug/kg (= 1.65 ml/h) of i.v. pentagastrin (left femoral vein) about 30 min after the end of the operation (i.e. after determination of 2 preliminary fractions). The substances to be tested were administered intraduodenally in a 2.5 ml/kg liquid volume 60 min after the start of the continuous pentagastrin infusion.<br>
The body temperature of the animals was kept at a constant 37.8-38°C by infrared irradiation and heat pads (automatic, stepless control by means of a rectal temperature sensor).<br>
