				<td>SUBSTITUTED DIHYDROPYRANO INDOLE-3.4-DIONE DERIVATIVES AS<br>
INHIBITORS OF PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR-1 (PAI-1)<br>
 This invention relates to substituted dihydropyrano indole-3,4-dione<br>
derivatives useful as inhibitors of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and<br>
therapeutic compositions containing such compounds for treating conditions resulting<br>
from fibrinolytic disorders such as deep vein thrombosis and coronary heart disease,<br>
and pulmonary fibrosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
 Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a major regulatory component of<br>
the plasminogen-plasmin system. PAI-1 is the principal physiologic inhibitor of both<br>
tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase type plasminogen activator<br>
(uPA). Elevated plasma levels of PAI-1 have been associated with thrombotic events<br>
as indicated by animal experiments (Krishnamurti, Blood, 69, 798 (1987); Reilly,<br>
Arteriosclerosis and Thrombosis, 11, 1276 (1991); Carmeliet, Journal of Clinical<br>
Investigation, 92, 2756 (1993)) and clinical studies (Rocha, Fibrinolysis, 8, 294, 1994;<br>
Aznar, Haemostasis 24, 243 (1994)). Antibody neutralization of PAI-1 activity<br>
resulted in promotion of endogenous thrombolysis and reperfusion (Biemond,<br>
Circulation, 91, 1175 (1995); Levi, Circulation 85, 305, (1992)). Elevated levels of<br>
PAI-1 have also been implicated in diseases of women such as polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome (Nordt, Journal of clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, 85, 4, 1563<br>
(2000)) and bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency (Daci, Journal of Bone and<br>
Mineral Research, 15, 8, 1510 (2000)). Accordingly, agents that inhibit PAI-1 would<br>
be of utility in treating conditions originating from fibrinolytic disorder such as deep<br>
vein thrombosis, coronary heart disease, pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease,<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome, etc.<br>

method described in Scheme I or modification thereof using readily available starting<br>
materials, reagents and conventional synthetic procedures. It is also possible to<br>
make use of variants of these process steps, which in themselves are known to and<br>
well within the preparatory skill of the medicinal chemist. In the following reaction<br>
schemes, R1, R2, R4, R5 and R6 are selected from the groups defined above.<br>
 In Scheme I, the bromo-indole-2-carboxylates (II) were reacted with alkyl<br>
halides or aryl-alkyl halides using a base such as sodium hydride in DMF or THF to<br>
give the N-substituted bromo-indole carboxylates (III). The N-substituted bromo-<br>
indole carboxylates (III) were then subjected to palladium catalyzed cross-coupling<br>
with various substituted aryl-halides affording the N-substituted Aryl-indole<br>
carboxylates (V). Alternatively, reaction of bromo-indole-2-carboxylates (II) with<br>
various substituted aryl-boronic acids under the palladium catalyzed cross-coupling<br>
conditions afforded the aryl-indole carboxylates (IV). Alkylation of (IV) with alkyl-<br>
halides or aryl-alkyl-halides under basic conditions as described above afforded the<br>
W-substituted Aryl-indole carboxylates (V). Reduction of V to the corresponding<br>
alcohol (VI) was accomplished by treating V with lithium aluminum hydride in ether or<br>
THF. Reaction of the alcohol (VI) with acetyl chloride in presence of a base such as<br>
triethyl amine or N,N-diisopropyl ethyl amine in an inert solvent such as methylene<br>
chloride afforded the acetate VII. Reaction of VII with oxalyl chloride in THF or<br><br><br>
dichloromethane and subsequent quenching with water furnished the keto acid VIII.<br>
Treatment of the acetate (Vill) with an aqueous base such as KOH or NaOH in a<br>
solvent such as THF furnished the carboxylate salt (IX). Lactonization of (IX) to the<br>
corresponding pyrano indole derivatives (I) was accomplished by treating IX with an<br>
aqueous acid such as hydrogen chloride in an organic solvent such as<br>
dichloromethane.<br><br>
 This invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a<br>
pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention,<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester form thereof, either alone or in<br><br><br>
combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients (i.e.<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable materials with no pharmacological effects). It will be<br>
understood that a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
compound herein refers to an amount of the compound in question which will<br>
sufficiently inhibit the serine protease inhibitor PAI-1 in the mammal in need thereof to<br>
a sufficient extent to provide a desirable improvement in the condition in question or<br>
provide sufficient inhibition of the serine protease inhibitor PAI-1 to prevent, inhibit or<br>
limit the onset of the physiological basis for the malady or condition in question.<br>
 The precise dosage to be employed depends upon several factors including<br>
the host, whether in veterinary medicine or human medicine, the nature and severity<br>
of the condition being treated, the mode of administration and the particular active<br>
substance employed. The compounds may be administered by any conventional<br>
route, in particular enterally, preferably orally in the form of tablets or capsules.<br>
Administered compounds can be in the free form or pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
form as appropriate, for use as a pharmaceutical, particularly for use in the<br>
prophylactic or curative treatment of atherosclerosis and sequelae (angina pectoris,<br>
myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, kidney failure, stroke, peripheral<br>
arterial occlusion, and related disease states). These measures will slow the rate of<br>
progress of the disease state and assist the body in reversing the process direction in<br>
a natural manner.<br>
 Any suitable carrier known to the art can be used to prepare the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. In such a composition, the carrier may be a solid,<br>
liquid or mixture of a solid and a liquid. Solid compositions include powders, tablets<br>
and capsules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as<br>
a flavoring agent, lubricant, solubilizer, suspending agent, binder, or tablet<br>
disintegrant. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in admixture<br>
with the finely divided active ingredient. In tablets, the active ingredient is mixed with<br>
a carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and<br>
compacted in the shape and size desired. Suitable solid carriers are magnesium<br>
carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin,<br>
tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl<br><br>
cellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. Encapsulating materials may<br>
also be employed with the compounds of this invention, and the term "composition" is<br>
intended to include the active ingredient in combination with an encapsulating<br>
material as a formulation, with or without other carriers. Cachets may also be used in<br>
the delivery of the anti-atherosclerotic medicament of this invention.<br>
 Sterile liquid compositions include solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups<br>
and elixirs. The compounds of this invention may be dissolved or suspended in the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a<br>
mixture of both. Preferably the liquid carrier is one suitable for parental injection.<br>
Where the compounds are sufficiently soluble they can be dissolved directly in<br>
normal saline with or without the use of suitable organic solvents, such as propylene<br>
glycol or polyethylene glycol. If desired, dispersions of the finely divided compounds<br>
can be made-up in aqueous starch or sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution, or in<br>
a suitable oil, such as arachis oil. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions, which are<br>
sterile solutions or suspensions, can be utilized by intramuscular, intraperitoneal or<br>
subcutaneous injection. In many instances a liquid composition form may be used<br>
instead of the preferred solid oral method of administration.<br>
 It is preferred to prepare unit dosage forms of the compounds for standard<br>
administration regimens. In this way, the composition can be subdivided readily into<br>
smaller doses at the physicians direction. For example, unit dosages may be made<br>
up in packeted powders, vials or ampoules and preferably in capsule or tablet form.<br>
The active compound present in these unit dosage forms of the composition may be<br>
present in an amount of from about one gram to about fifteen grams or more, for<br>
single or multiple daily administration, according to the particular need of the patient.<br>
The daily dose of active compound will vary depending upon the route of<br>
administration, the size, age and sex of the patient, the severity of the disease state,<br>
and the response to the therapy as traced by blood analysis and the patients recovery rate. By initiating the treatment regimen with a minimal daily dose of about<br>
one gram, the blood levels of PAI-1 and the patients symptomatic relief analysis may<br>
be used to determine whether a larger dose is indicated. Based upon the data<br>
presented below, the projected daily dose for both human and veterinary use will be<br><br><br>
from about 25 to about 200 milligrams/kilogram per day, and more usually, from<br>
about 50 to about 100 milligrams/kilogram per day.<br>
 The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit plasminogen activator<br>
inhibitor-1 was established by the following experimental procedures:<br>
PRIMARY SCREEN FOR THE PAI-1 INHIBITION<br>
 Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a final concentration of 10mM,<br>
then diluted 100X in physiologic buffer. The inhibitory assay was initiated by the<br>
addition of the test compound (1 - 100 nM final concentration, maximum DMSO<br>
concentration of 0 2%) in a pH 6.6 buffer containing 140 nM recombinant human<br>
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Molecular Innovations, Royal Oak, Ml). Following<br>
a 1 hour incubation at room temperature, 70 nM of recombinant' human tissue<br>
plasminogen activator (tPA) was added, and the combination of the test compound,<br>
PAI-1 and tPA was incubated for an additional 30 minutes. Following the second<br>
incubation, Spectrozyme-tPA (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), a<br>
chromogenic substrate for tPA, was added and absorbance read at 405 nm at 0 and<br>
60 minutes. Relative PAI-1 inhibition was equal to the residual tPA activity in the<br>
presence of the test compound and PAI-1. Control treatments included the complete<br>
inhibition of tPA by PAI-1 at the molar ratio employed (2:1), and the absence of any<br>
effect of the test compound on tPA alone.<br>
ASSAY FOR DETERMINING IC50 OF INHIBITION OF PAI-1<br>
 This assay is based upon the non-SDS dissociable interaction between tPA<br>
and active PAI-1. Assay plates were initially coated with human tPA (10 ng/ml). Test<br>
compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM, then diluted with physiologic buffer<br>
(pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 1-50?M. Test compounds were, incubated with human PAI-1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The tPA-coated plate<br>
was washed with a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, then the plate was<br>
blocked with a solution of 3% BSA. An aliquot of the test compound/PAI-1 solution<br>
was then added to the tPA-coated plate, incubated at room temperature for 1 hour,<br>
and washed. Active PAI-1 bound to the plate was assessed by adding an aliquot of a<br><br><br>
1:1000 dilution of the 33B8 monoclonal antibody against human PAI-1. and<br>
incubating the plate at room temperature for 1 hour (Molecular Innovations, Royal<br>
Oak, Ml). The plate was again washed, and a solution of goat anti-mouse IgG-<br>
alkaline phosphatase conjugate is added at a 1:50,000 dilution in goat serum. The<br>
plate was incubated 30 minutes at room temperature, washed, and a solution of<br>
alkaline phosphatase substrate is added. The plate was incubated 45 minutes at<br>
room temperature, and color development is determined at OD405nm. The quantitation<br>
of active PAI-1 bound to tPA at varying concentrations of the test compound was<br>
used to determine the IC50. Results were analyzed using a logarithmic best-fit<br>
equation. The assay sensitivity was 5 ng/ml of human PAI-1 as determined from a<br>
standard curve ranging from 0-100 ng/ml.<br>
