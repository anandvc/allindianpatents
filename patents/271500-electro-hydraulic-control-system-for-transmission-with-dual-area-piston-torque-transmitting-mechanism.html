				<td>ELECTRO-HYDRAULIC CONTROL SYSTEM FOR TRANSMISSION WITH DUAL-<br>
AREA PISTON FOR TORQUE-TRANSMITTING MECHANISM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an electro-hydraulic control system for a<br>
transmission; specifically, for pressurizing one or both areas of a dual-area piston to<br>
engage a torque-transmitting mechanism.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Dual-area apply pistons have two piston areas to which pressurized fluid<br>
may be individually fed in order to engage a torque-transmitting mechanism. During<br>
operating conditions in which a high torque capacity is required, such as in a low range or<br>
a starting gear to handle stall torque, both piston areas are fed pressurized fluid. Because<br>
pressurized fluid is thus applied over a greater area, a larger force is applied to engage the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism, resulting in a larger torque capacity (also referred to as<br>
clutch capacity). During operating conditions in which less torque capacity is required,<br>
such as when operating in higher speed ratios, only one of the piston areas is fed<br>
pressurized fluid, thus engaging the torque-transmitting mechanism, but at a lesser torque<br>
capacity and with a faster fill time of the clutch cavity. Typically, a dual-area piston<br>
requires the use of two separate trim systems to direct pressurized fluid to each separate<br>
piston area fill cavity (i.e., each fill cavity typically requires a separate, dedicated<br>
solenoid valve and trim valve that direct pressurized fluid to the fill cavity when the<br>
solenoid valve is energized).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A torque-transmitting mechanism engagable by application of a dual-area<br>
piston allows the ability to operate the torque-transmitting mechanism at a lower torque<br>
capacity when appropriate, which may reduce the overall pump size required for the<br>
hydraulic control system that controls engagement of the torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
and allow faster clutch cavity fill times. A high clutch gain (i.e., the ratio of torque<br><br>
capacity (lb.-ft.) to main pressure of the control system (pounds per square inch) results<br>
in more shift-to-shift variation and more temperature inconsistency. Thus, the ability to<br>
operate at a lower torque capacity when appropriate improves shift quality, and results in<br>
better shift consistency.<br>
[0004]      An electro-hydraulic control system is provided that utilizes a single trim<br>
system to direct pressurized fluid to one or both fill cavities of a dual-area apply piston<br>
by providing a dedicated solenoid valve and a spring-biased shift valve responsive to<br>
energizing of the solenoid valve. Specifically, an electro-hydraulic control system is<br>
provided for a multi-speed transmission having a plurality of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms including a selectively engagable torque-transmitting mechanism engagable<br>
by application of fluid pressure to a dual-area piston with a first piston area and a<br>
second piston area, and a source of pressurized fluid. The electro-hydraulic control<br>
system includes a shift valve (SV3) movable between a stroked position (pressure-set)<br>
and an unstroked position (spring-set). A spring urges the shift valve to the unstroked<br>
position. The shift valve permits pressurized fluid that is in fluid communication with<br>
the first piston area to also be in fluid communication with the second piston area when<br>
the shift valve is in the unstroked position such that pressurized fluid is applied to both<br>
of the piston areas to engage the torque-transmitting mechanism with the dual-area<br>
piston. The shift valve blocks the pressurized fluid from the second piston area when<br>
in the stroked position so that the pressurized fluid is applied only to the first piston<br>
area to engage the torque-transmitting mechanism with the dual-area piston. A solenoid<br>
valve (SS1) is in fluid communication with the shift valve and is energizable to thereby<br>
direct pressurized fluid to the shift valve to act on the shift valve with the spring to<br>
further urge the shift valve to the unstroked position. Pressurized fluid may also be<br>
applied to act on the shift valve against the spring, and provides an equal but opposite<br>
force on the shift valve to that of the pressurized fluid from solenoid valve (SS1),<br>
resulting in the spring force pushing the valve to the unstroked position. When<br>
solenoid valve (SS1) is off and pressurized fluid acts on the valve against the spring, the<br><br>
valve will stroke. When solenoid valve (SS1) is on, the shift valve will be unstroked<br>
regardless of whether pressurized fluid acts against the spring.<br>
[0005]	Preferably, a control regulator valve is in fluid communication with the<br>
main pressure source and regulates fluid at a main pressure supplied by the main<br>
pressure source to a control pressure. The fluid directed by the solenoid valve (SS1) to<br>
urge the shift valve to the unstroked position is at the control pressure, the fluid urging<br>
the shift valve to the stroked position is also at the control pressure, and the fluid<br>
applied to the dual-area piston is at the main pressure.<br>
[0006]	Preferably, the pressurized fluid that is in fluid communication with the<br>
first piston area is selectively provided via a trim valve that communicates pressurized<br>
fluid to a first logic valve. The first logic valve (SV2) multiplexes the trim valve by<br>
directing the pressurized fluid to the first piston area when the first logic valve is in a<br>
first position, and to another of the torque-transmitting mechanisms when the first logic<br>
valve is in a second position. As used herein, a valve is "multiplexed" when it has more<br>
than one function, such as when it is able to at least partially control engagement of more<br>
than one torque-transmitting mechanism.<br>
[0007]	Preferably, a second logic valve (SV1) is in fluid communication with<br>
the solenoid valve (SS1) and moves when the solenoid valve is energized from a<br>
spring-set position, to which it is biased, to a pressure-set position. A pressure switch<br>
(S7) in fluid communication with the second logic valve is pressurized when the second<br>
logic valve is in the pressure-set position. The second logic valve allows pressurized<br>
fluid to the other torque-transmitting mechanism (to which the first logic valve<br>
multiplexes the trim valve) when the trim valve is stroked to allow pressurized fluid to<br>
the first logic valve, when the second logic valve is in the pressure-set position, and<br>
when the first logic valve is in the pressure-set position.  Furthermore, the second logic<br>
valve is configured to be latched in the pressure-set position by pressurized fluid<br>
selectively applied to the second logic valve so that the second logic valve remains in<br>
the pressure-set position even when the solenoid valve is no longer energized to thereby<br><br>
prevent the pressurized fluid acting on the shift valve against the spring from<br>
exhausting.<br>
[0008]	Preferably, the above-mentioned valves, as well as additional valves in<br>
the control system, are configured to establish one of the speed ratios if the electronic<br>
controller becomes inoperable during a first set of the speed ratios and to establish<br>
another of the speed ratios if the electronic controller becomes inoperable during a<br>
second set of the speed ratios. Thus, there are different predetermined failure modes<br>
for different speed ratios.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

portion of the electro-hydraulic control system of Figure 1 having valves to control<br>
engagement and disengagement of the torque-transmitting mechanisms of Figure 1;<br>
[0013]	FIGURE 4 is a schematic representation in fragmentary view of the<br>
hydraulic control portion shown in Figure 3B;<br>
[0014]	FIGURE 5 is a table indicating the state of many of the valves shown in<br>
Figures 3A and 3B for each speed ratio of the transmission of Figure 1; and<br>
[0015]	FIGURE 6 is a schematic representation in fragmentary view of the<br>
hydraulic control portion shown in Figure 3A.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent the<br>
same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
powertrain 10. The powertrain 10 includes a power source or engine 12, a torque<br>
converter 14 and a multi-speed transmission 16. The torque converter 14 is connected<br>
with the engine 12 and with a transmission input member 18 via a turbine 20. Selective<br>
engagement of a torque converter clutch TCC allows the engine 12 to be directly<br>
connected with the input shaft 18, bypassing the torque converter 14. The input<br>
member 18 is typically a shaft, and may be referred to as an input shaft herein. The<br>
torque converter 14 includes the turbine 20, a pump 24 and a stator 26. The converter<br>
stator 26 is grounded to a casing 30 through a typical one-way clutch that is not shown.<br>
A damper 28 is operatively connected to the engaged torque converter clutch TCC for<br>
absorbing vibration.<br>
[0017]	The transmission 16 includes a first planetary gear set 40, a second<br>
planetary gear set 50, a third planetary gear set 60, and a fourth planetary gear set 70.<br>
The first planetary gear set includes a sun gear member 42, a ring gear member 44, and a<br>
carrier member 46 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears 47 that intermesh with<br>
both the ring gear member 44 and the sun gear member 42. The second planetary gear<br>
set 50 includes a sun gear member 52, a ring gear member 54, and a carrier member 56<br>
rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears 57 that intermesh with both the ring gear<br>
member 54 and the sun gear member 52. The third planetary gear set 60 includes a sun<br>
gear member 62, a ring gear member 64, and a carrier member 66 rotatably supporting a<br>
plurality of pinion gears 67 that intermesh with both the ring gear member 64 and the sun<br>
gear member 62. The fourth planetary gear set 70 includes a sun gear member 72, a ring<br>
gear member 74, and a carrier member 76 rotatably supporting a plurality of pinion gears<br>
77 that intermesh with both the ring gear member 74 and the sun gear member 72.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 16 further includes a plurality of torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms, including the torque converter clutch TCC, two rotating clutches: Cl and<br>
C2; and four stationary clutches C3, C4, C5 and C6. Torque is transferred from the input<br><br>
member 18 to an output member 80 along various powerflow paths through the<br>
transmission 16 depending on which of the plurality of selectively engagable torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms are engaged. A retarder 81 is operatively connected to the<br>
output shaft 80 and is controllable to slow the output shaft 80 during certain vehicle<br>
operating conditions. The retarder 81 may be any of the many types known to those<br>
skilled in the art. A retarder flow valve 83 controls the flow of fluid into a cavity within<br>
the retarder 81. Additional fluid within the cavity further slows the output shaft 80.<br>
[0019]	The input member 18 is continuously connected for common rotation with<br>
sun gear members 42 and 52. The output member 80 is continuously connected for<br>
common rotation with carrier member 76. Cl is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
input member 18 for common rotation with sun gear members 62 and 72. C2 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the input member 18 for common rotation with carrier<br>
member 66 and ring gear member 74. C3 is selectively engagable to ground ring gear<br>
member 54 to the transmission casing 30. C4 is selectively engagable to ground ring gear<br>
member 64, carrier member 56 and ring gear member 44 to the transmission casing 30.<br>
C5 is selectively engagable to ground ring gear member 74 and carrier member 66 to the<br>
transmission casing 30. C6 is selectively engagable to ground carrier member 46 to the<br>
transmission casing 30.<br>
[0020]	The selective engagement and disengagement of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is controlled by an electro-hydraulic control system 82, which is shown in<br>
further detail in Figures 3A and 3B. The electro-hydraulic control system 82 includes an<br>
electronic controller 84, which may be one or more control units and is referred to as<br>
ECU in Figure 1, as well as a hydraulic control portion 86 referred to as HYD in Figure<br>
1. The electronic controller 84 is programmable to provide electrical control signals to<br>
the hydraulic control portion 86 to establish the fluid pressures that control engagement<br>
and disengagement of the torque-transmitting mechanisms TCC, Cl, C2, C3, C4, C5 and<br>
C6. The hydraulic control portion 86 is operatively connected to each of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms TCC, Cl, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 by a fluid connection<br>
illustrated only schematically as dashed lines in Figure 1 and in more detail as various<br>
passages, solenoids and valves shown in Figures 3A and 3B. The hydraulic control<br><br>
portion 86 provides pressurized fluid to apply pistons that apply pressure to the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms to cause frictional engagement of friction and reaction plates of<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanisms to establish the desired operative connections.<br>
[0021]	Referring to Figure 2, an engagement schedule indicates with an "X" each<br>
of the torque-transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6 that are engaged to<br>
establish each of nine forward speed ratios FWD1, FWD2, FWD3, FWD4, FWD5,<br>
FWD6, FWD7, FWD8, and FWD9, as well as a Neutral mode and a reverse speed ratio<br>
REV1.<br>
[0022]	Referring again to Figure 1, single-area apply pistons PI, P2, P3 and P4<br>
are in fluid communication with the pressurized fluid supplied by the hydraulic control<br>
portion 86 to engage the torque-transmitting mechanisms Cl, C2, C3, and C4 according<br>
to the engagement schedule of Figure 2. A single-area apply piston has only one<br>
effective surface area to which fluid pressure is applied to cause engagement of the<br>
adjacent torque-transmitting mechanism. Assuming a constant apply pressure, torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms engaged by a single-area piston have a single clutch capacity<br>
(i.e., torque capacity). Dual-area apply pistons P5 and P6 are used to engage torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms C5 and C6, respectively. The dual-area apply piston P5 has two<br>
piston areas, a first piston area PA1, and a second piston area PA2, each with a fill cavity<br>
to which pressurized fluid may be separately routed by the hydraulic control portion 86<br>
so that the apply piston P5 is applied with less force when pressurized fluid is supplied to<br>
only one of the piston areas PA1 or PA2, and with greater force when pressurized fluid is<br>
supplied to both of the piston areas PA1 and PA2. As is apparent in Figure 2, torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism C5 is engaged in the first forward speed ratio FWD1 and the<br>
reverse speed ratio REV1. In those speed ratios, more torque is required at the output<br>
member 80, and thus greater clutch capacity is required by torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism C5. However, in the second forward speed ratio FWD2, the torque required<br>
is significantly less. By supplying pressurized fluid to only the first piston area PA1,<br>
hydraulic energy requirements are minimized. A dual-area piston P6 is also supplied to<br>
engage torque-transmitting mechanism C6 with pressurized fluid supplied to both a first<br>
piston area and a second piston area in the first forward speed ratio FWD1, and applied to<br><br>
only the first piston area in the ninth forward speed ratio FWD9, as far greater clutch<br>
capacity is required in the first forward speed ratio FWD1 than in the ninth forward speed<br>
ratio FWD9. Various types of dual-area pistons are known to those skilled in the art of<br>
transmission design, and any dual-area piston may be used for pistons P5 and P6.<br>
[0023]	Together, Figures 3A and 3B represent the complete hydraulic control<br>
portion 86, with the fragmented portions in each Figure connecting at like-numbered<br>
passages, from top to bottom, passages 104, 182, 149, 151, 153, 157, 172, 174 and 159.<br>
The hydraulic control portion 86 includes a main regulator valve 90, a control regulator<br>
valve 92, two EBF (exhaust back flow) regulator valves 94 and 109, a converter flow<br>
valve 96, and a lube regulator valve 98. The main regulator valve 90 is in fluid<br>
communication with a hydraulic pump 100 that draws fluid from a reservoir 102 for<br>
delivery to a main passage 104. The pump 100 and reservoir 102 constitute a main<br>
pressure source of pressurized fluid at a pressure referred to herein as "main pressure" or<br>
"line pressure". The control regulator valve 92 is in fluid communication with the main<br>
regulator valve 90, and establishes a reduced control pressure within passage 149, which<br>
may then be communicated to other valves as described below. The EBF regulator valve<br>
94 is operable to vent fluid within passage 106 to exhaust should an over pressurized<br>
condition occur, and the EBF regulator valve 109 is operable to vent fluid within passage<br>
153 should an overpressurized condition occur. Pump 100 is an engine-driven pump that<br>
draws fluid from reservoir 102 that is ultimately used to engage the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms of Figure 1, to pressurize the valves of Figures 3 A and 3B, to provide<br>
lubrication pressure to a lubrication system 110 and cooling fluid to a transmission<br>
cooling system 112.<br>
[0024]	A relief valve 114 is provided for the main pressure passage 104. A main<br>
regulator control passage accumulator 116 is provided to accumulate control pressure<br>
fluid in passage 118 when fluid at such pressure is provided to that passage. A converter<br>
relief valve 120 is provided for pressure at the converter flow valve 96 to the torque<br>
converter feed 122. A filter regulator valve 124 controls pressure through a filter 126 for<br>
the lubrication fluid provided to lubrication feed 128.<br><br>
[0025]	The hydraulic control portion 86 includes many pressure control solenoid<br>
valves, such as variable pressure-type solenoid valves PCS1, PCS2, PCS3, PCS4, PCS5,<br>
PCS6, and TCC, and shift-type (i.e., on/off type) solenoid valves SSI and SS2. Each<br>
solenoid valve is in electric signal communication with the electronic controller 84 and is<br>
actuated upon receipt of a control signal therefrom. The solenoid valves PCS1, PCS2 and<br>
PCS5 are normally high or normally open-type solenoid valves, while the remaining<br>
solenoid valves PCS3, PCS4, PCS6, TCC, SS1 and SS2 are normally low or normally<br>
closed-type solenoid valves. As is well known, an open solenoid valve will distribute<br>
output pressure in the absence of an electrical signal to the solenoid. As used herein, a<br>
normally high-type solenoid is energized by a control signal to be placed in and to remain<br>
in a closed position (to prevent fluid flow therethrough), while a normally low-type valve<br>
is energized to be placed in and to remain in an open position (to allow fluid flow<br>
therethrough). The variable pressure-type solenoid valves are chosen as normally high-<br>
type or normally-low type so that, should a power failure occur and the electronic<br>
controller 84 is unable to energize the valves, the variable pressure-type solenoid valves,<br>
along with the trim valves, logic valves and shift valves will "fail" to positions that<br>
establish a predetermined, favorable one of the available speed ratios. For example, if a<br>
power failure occurs when the transmission 16 is operating in reverse REVI or neutral,<br>
the valves will be positioned to establish the neutral state. If a power failure occurs while<br>
the transmission 16 is operating in any of the first through fifth forward speed ratios, the<br>
valves will be positioned to establish the fifth forward speed ratio FWD5. If a power<br>
failure occurs during the sixth forward speed ratio FWD6, the valves will be positioned to<br>
establish the sixth forward speed ratio. If a power failure occurs during any of the<br>
seventh through ninth forward speed ratios FWD7-FWD9, the valves will be positioned<br>
to establish the seventh forward speed ratio FWD7.<br>
[0026]	The hydraulic control portion 86 also includes a plurality of trim valves<br>
130, 132, 134, 136, 138 and 140. Trim valve 130, solenoid valve PCS1 and accumulator<br>
valve 142 are a first trim system that, as will be further explained below, is multiplexed to<br>
control engagement and disengagement of both clutch Cl and clutch C3. Trim valve<br>
132, solenoid valve PCS2, and accumulator valve 144 are a second trim system that is<br><br>
multiplexed to control engagement and disengagement of both clutch C2 and C3. Trim<br>
valve 134, solenoid valve PCS3, and accumulator valve 146 are a third trim system that is<br>
multiplexed to control engagement and disengagement of both clutch C3 and C5. Trim<br>
valve 136, solenoid valve PCS4, and accumulator valve 148 are a fourth trim system that<br>
controls engagement of the clutch C4. Trim valve 138, solenoid valve PCS6,<br>
accumulator valve 150, and shift valve SV4 are a fifth trim system that controls<br>
engagement and disengagement of clutch C6, which is a clutch that has a dual-area apply<br>
piston. The trim valve 138, solenoid valve PCS6, accumulator valve 150, and shift valve<br>
SV4 interact to determine whether pressurized fluid is supplied only to fill cavity C6A,<br>
for applications of clutch C6 requiring less torque capacity (e.g., in the ninth forward<br>
speed ratio FWD9; see Figure 5), or whether pressurized fluid is supplied to both fill<br>
cavities C6A and C6B, for applications of clutch C6 requiring greater torque capacity<br>
(e.g., in the first and third forward speed ratios, FWD1 and FWD3; see Figure 5). Trim<br>
valve 140, solenoid valve PCS TCC, converter flow valve 96 and converter relief valve<br>
120 are a sixth trim system that controls engagement of torque converter clutch TCC.<br>
[0027]	Solenoid valve SS1 and shift valve S V3 are a trim system that, along with<br>
a control pressure signal from passage 156, logic valve SV1, trim valve 134, solenoid<br>
valve PCS3 and accumulator valve 146, controls engagement and disengagement of<br>
clutch C5 and whether engagement is by fluid pressure supplied at a fill cavity C5A for<br>
the first piston area PA1, so that the clutch C5 is engaged with a lesser torque capacity, or<br>
by fluid pressure supplied to fill cavity C5A and to a fill cavity C5B for a the second<br>
piston area PA2 as well, so that the clutch C5 is engaged with a higher torque capacity.<br>
For each trim system, actuation of the associated solenoid valve causes actuation of the<br>
respective trim valve and clutch (or one of the respective clutches in the case of<br>
multiplexed trim valves). Solenoid valve PCS5 and the main regulator valve 90 control<br>
the main pressure level in main passage 104 from the pump 100.<br>
[0028]	The hydraulic control portion 86 further includes logic valve SV2, referred<br>
to herein as a first logic valve, and logic valve SV1, referred to herein as a second logic<br>
valve. Solenoid SS1 receives an electrical control signal from the electronic controller 84<br>
to actuate or shift, thereby supplying fluid at control pressure from passage 159 to<br><br>
passage 152 at the heads of valves SV1 and SV2, acting against bias springs positioned at<br>
the other end of the respective valves SV1 and SV2 that bias the valves SV1 and SV2<br>
upward against passage 152. As best viewed in Figure 3B, when solenoid valve SS1 is<br>
energized, fluid at control pressure in passage 152 is also supplied to the end of valve<br>
SV3 to act with a bias spring 154 to force the head of the valve SV3 down against<br>
passage 156. Passage 156 is also filled with fluid at control pressure while SV1 is in the<br>
stroked position. As is clear from Figures 3A and 3B, the logic valves SV1 and SV2 are<br>
in fluid communication with the trim valves 130, 132 and 134 and the respective solenoid<br>
valves PCS 1, PCS2 and PCS3; the energized or unenergized status of solenoid valves<br>
PCS1, PCS2 and PCS3 determines the positions of logic valves SV1 and SV2 and thus<br>
whether pressurized fluid is provided to fill cavities to engage torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms Cl, C2, C3 and the fill cavity for the first piston area PA1 for C5, referred to<br>
as C5A. The logic valves multiplex the respective trim valves by allowing pressure<br>
directed through the trim valve to be directed to different clutches depending on the<br>
position of the logic valve. For example, the logic valve SV2 multiplexes trim valve 134<br>
as it directs fluid pressure to fill cavity C5A, and then the first piston area PA1 of clutch<br>
C5 when in the spring-set position, but directs the pressurized fluid to a fluid cavity at<br>
clutch C3 when in the pressure-set (stroked) position. (The fluid cavities for the various<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism are represented as ports in Figures 3A and 3B, and are<br>
labeled "to C2", to "C5A", etc.)<br>
[0029]	When pressurized fluid is provided to fill cavity C5A, it may also be<br>
provided to the fill cavity for the second piston area PA2 of clutch C5, referred to as<br>
C5B, if the shift valve SV3 is in a spring-set, unstroked position, as shown in Figure 3B.<br>
The position of shift valve SV3 is dependent upon various factors. First, if solenoid<br>
valve SS1 is energized, pressurized fluid is provided to passage 152 and acts with the<br>
spring 154 to keep the shift valve SV3 in an unstroked position. This is true regardless of<br>
whether pressurized fluid (at the control pressure) is in passage 156, as force of the<br>
control pressure fluid in passage 152 acting on the shift valve SV3 with the force of the<br>
spring 154 also acting on the shift valve SV3 will overcome the force of control pressure<br>
fluid in passage 152 acting on the shift valve SV3. If pressurized fluid is present in<br><br>
passage 156 but not in passage 152, the shift valve SV3 will be in the stroked position.<br>
Pressurized fluid will be present in passage 156 at all times pump 100 is on, unless the<br>
pressurized fluid is exhausted through passage 153. The pressurized fluid will exhaust<br>
through passage 153 when the logic valve SV1 is in the spring-set or unstroked position.<br>
However, if logic valve SV1 is in the pressure-set or stroked position, pressurized fluid in<br>
passage 156 cannot exhaust, as the lowest land of logic valve SV1 blocks flow from<br>
passage 156 to passage 153, as illustrated in Figure 4. Logic valve SV1 will be in the<br>
stroked position if solenoid valve SS1 is energized. Even if solenoid valve SSI is not<br>
energized, logic valve SV1 will be latched in the stroked position if control pressure fluid<br>
is provided in passage 157 while solenoid valve SS1 is still energized, prior to<br>
deenergizing solenoid valve SS1. Because the control pressure fluid would then act on<br>
different pressure responsive areas of the top two lands of logic valve SV1, with the<br>
lower of the two lands having a larger pressure responsive area, logic valve SV1 will be<br>
"latched" (i.e., retained in a specific position by fluid pressure) in a spring-set position<br>
and pressurized fluid in passage 156 will not be able to exhaust. This latching situation<br>
occurs in speed ratios FWD2, FWD3, FWD4, ALT4, FWD5, and FWD6, as those skilled<br>
in the art will be able to readily determine based on the information set forth in Figure 5.<br>
Assuming control pressure fluid is present in passage 156, shift valve SV3 is in the<br>
spring-set position when solenoid valve SS1 is energized, as control pressure fluid is then<br>
applied to both ends of valve SV3. However, as best viewed in Figure 4, when shift<br>
valve SV3 is not energized, the fluid in passage 152 is exhausted and the control pressure<br>
fluid present in passage 156 in forward speed ratios will stroke the valve SV3, moving it<br>
to the stroked position shown in Figure 4, overcoming the bias of spring 154, and<br>
blocking the passage 158 so that pressurized fluid provided to fill cavity C5A cannot fill<br>
cavity C5B. Pressure switch PS7 is in fluid communication with the logic valve SV1 and<br>
is pressurized when logic valve SV1 is in the pressure-set position.<br>
[0030]	Referring to Figure 5, a table shows the steady-state conditions of the<br>
following valves during available speed ratios (also referred to as ranges): logic valves<br>
SV1 and SV2, switch valves SV3 and SV4, and pressure control solenoid valves PCS1,<br>
PCS2, PCS3, PCS4, PCS5, PCS6, PCS TCC and SS1. With respect to valves SS1, SV1,<br><br>
SV2, SV3, and SV4, an "0" in the chart indicates that the valve is in a spring-set position<br>
("unstroked") and a "1" indicates that the valve is in a pressure-set position ("stroked").<br>
Although not listed in the chart of Figure 5, switch valve SV5 is in a pressure-set position<br>
in any of the speed ratios whenever vehicle operating conditions warrant application of<br>
the retarder 81 and, therefore, solenoid SS2 is energized. The speed ratios listed in Figure<br>
5 correspond with those of the engagement chart of Figure 2, except optional alternate<br>
speed ratios ALT2, ALT 4 and ALT 8 are listed and may be used in lieu of speed ratios<br>
FWD2, FWD4 and FWD8.<br>
[0031J	With respect to the columns in Figure 5 for the respective pressure control<br>
solenoid valves PCS1, PCS2, PCS3, PCS4, PCS6 and TCC, the clutch listed for a<br>
particular speed ratio in a column for a particular solenoid valve indicates that the state of<br>
the solenoid valve determines whether pressurized fluid is communicated to that clutch<br>
during that speed ratio. If the box listing the clutch is not shaded, then the solenoid is not<br>
energized in the case of a normally closed-type solenoid or is energized in the case of a<br>
normally open-type solenoid, and the listed clutch is not engaged during that speed ratio.<br>
If the box is shaded, then the solenoid is energized in the case of a normally closed-type<br>
solenoid or is not energized in the case of a normally-open type solenoid, and the listed<br>
clutch is thereby engaged during that speed ratio. The column of Figure 5 labeled<br>
"Exhaust" indicates which of the clutches are being exhausted (emptied of pressurized<br>
fluid) during each of the various speed ratios.<br>
[0032]	The hydraulic control portion 86 is shown in the neutral state in Figures<br>
3A and 3B. Normally-high pressure control solenoids PCS 1 and PCS2 are energized to<br>
block flow of pressurized fluid therethrough. Pressure control solenoid PCS3 is<br>
energized, so that trim valve 134 is in a pressure-set position. The other trim valves 130,<br>
132, 136, 138,140, as well as the logic valves SV1 and SV2 and switch valves SV3, SV4<br>
and SV5 are all shown in a spring-set position. It should be appreciated, that each of<br>
these valves has two steady-state positions. That is, if normally-low pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS3 is not energized, the trim valve 134 will slide upward from its position of<br>
Figure 3B so that flow of main pressure fluid to passage 170 is blocked by the lowest<br>
land of valve 134. Similarly, if normally-high pressure control solenoid PCS1 is not<br><br>
energized, trim valve 130 will move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3 A<br>
to a pressure set position in which flow of main pressure fluid is permitted from passage<br>
104 to passage 172. If normally-high pressure control solenoid PCS2 is not energized,<br>
trim valve 132 will move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3 A to a<br>
pressure-set position in which flow of main pressure fluid is permitted from passage 104<br>
to passage 174. If normally-low pressure control solenoid PCS4 is energized, trim valve<br>
136 will move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3A to a pressure-set<br>
position in which flow of main pressure fluid is permitted from passage 104 to passage<br>
176. If normally-low pressure control solenoid PCS6 is energized, trim valve 138 will<br>
move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3 A to a pressure-set position in<br>
which flow of main pressure fluid is permitted from passage 104 to passages 178 and<br>
180. If normally-low pressure control solenoid PCS TCC is energized, trim valve 140<br>
will move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3 A to a pressure-set position<br>
in which flow of main pressure fluid is permitted from passage 104 to passage 182. If<br>
normally-high pressure control solenoid PCS5 is not energized, flow of control pressure<br>
fluid is permitted from passage 149 to passages 160 and 118. If shift solenoid SS2 is<br>
energized, shift valve SV5 will move downward from its spring-set position of Figure 3A<br>
to a pressure set position in which flow of control pressure fluid is permitted from<br>
passage 149 to passage 118, and to feed passage 161. If shift solenoid SSI is energized,<br>
control pressure fluid will be provided to passage 152. The effect on movement of shift<br>
valves SV1, SV2 and SV3 from the spring-set positions shown to pressure-set positions is<br>
described with respect to the dual-area piston fill cavities C5A and C5B.<br>
[0033]	With respect to pressure control solenoid PCS5, in Figure 3A, "MM/Rtdr"<br>
indicates that the pressure control solenoid PCS5 may be energized as necessary to<br>
control an output pressure in passage 160 that controls a pressure bias on the main<br>
regulator valve 90. When pressure control solenoid PCS5 is not energized, as shown in<br>
Figure 3A, fluid at control pressure established by the control pressure regulator valve 92<br>
is provided to passage 160. By varying the pressure within passage 118, the pressure<br>
control solenoid PCS5 is operable to vary the operating characteristics of the main<br>
regulator valve 90, thereby modulating the pressure within the passage 104. The pressure<br><br>
control solenoid PCS5 and passage 160 are in communication with passage 118 through a<br>
shift valve SV5 that shifts between a spring-set position (shown in Figure 3A) and a<br>
pressure-set position shown in Figure 6, achieved when a solenoid valve SS2 is<br>
energized. The solenoid valve SS2 is energized during vehicle decelerations and other<br>
events when operation of the retarder 81 is desirable. When shift valve SV5 is in the<br>
pressure-set position of Figure 6, control pressure is directed through feed passage 149 to<br>
feed passage 161 which feeds the retarder flow valve 83 of Figure 1 that controls filling<br>
of the retarder 81 and thus on/off operation of the retarder 81. When shift valve SV5 is in<br>
the pressure-set position, spring 155 maintaining valve SV5 in the spring-set position is<br>
compressed, and the lands 163 and 165 move downward so that fluid from passage 149 is<br>
in communication with feed passage 161 and with passage 118. Control pressure is sent<br>
through valve SV5 to passage 118. Thus, control pressure is applied to the top land 167<br>
of the main regulator valve 90, and the main regulator valve 90 has "full line<br>
modulation", which is desirable during retarder operation. That is, with control pressure<br>
applied at the top of land 167, additional pressure is placed on spool 169 via spring 171,<br>
resulting in "full line modulation" of the main regulator valve 90 and the main pressure.<br>
This prevents fluid at main pressure in passage 104 from communicating with the torque<br>
converter feed 122 and lubrication system 110, to better maintain full line pressure in<br>
passage 104, which is desirable during the same operating conditions that retarder<br>
operation is desirable, as additional driveline energy is used by the pump 100 to provide<br>
the higher pressure. When normally-high pressure control solenoid valve PCS5 is<br>
energized and normally-low solenoid valve SS2 is not energized as illustrated in Figure<br>
3A, the fluid in passages 160 and 118 is at a lower trim pressure, rather than at control<br>
pressure, and this lower pressure is provided to the top land 167. This results in<br>
"minimum line modulation" by the main regulator valve 90, as line pressure in passage<br>
104 is more readily provided to the torque converter feed 122 and the lube system 110.<br>
The electronic controller 84 can continuously adjust the pressure control solenoid valve<br>
PCS5 to modulate pressure in passage 118 based on engine torque transmitting through<br>
the transmission 16, resulting in a closed loop control condition referred to herein as<br>
"variable line modulation" of the main regulator valve 90 and the main pressure.<br><br>
Information of engine torque is provided via sensors and may be relayed from a separate<br>
engine control module to the electronic controller 84.<br>
[0034]	The position of shift valve SV5 also affects the position of a retarder<br>
regulator valve 162 that functions to adjust the pressure within the retarder 81 of Figure<br>
1. When the retarder regulator valve 162 is in the spring-set position shown in Figure 3A<br>
(i.e., biased by spring 179), feed passage 164 (which provides fluid to the retarder 81 to<br>
control pressure in the retarder cavity) exhausts through the exhaust port 175. When shift<br>
solenoid SS2 is energized and normally-high pressure control solenoid valve PCS5 is<br>
energized, valve SV5 is in the pressure-set position shown in Figure 6, fluid at trim<br>
pressure is directed through passage 166 to move the retarder regulator valve 162 to a<br>
pressure-set position in which land 173 is moved downward against spring 179 and land<br>
177 blocks exhaust port 175, to prevent fluid at main pressure fed to the retarder feed<br>
passage 164 from venting and thereby increasing pressure in the retarder 81.<br>
[0035]	As is apparent from the chart of Figure 5, the pressure control solenoid<br>
PCS1 and the first trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control the<br>
engagement and disengagement of both clutches Cl and C3. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS2 and the second trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control<br>
the engagement and disengagement of both clutches C2 and C3. The pressure control<br>
solenoid PCS3 and the third trim system of which it is a part is multiplexed to control the<br>
engagement and disengagement of both clutches C3 and C5. Pressure control solenoid<br>
PCS4 controls the engagement of the clutch C4. Pressure control solenoid PCS5 controls<br>
the pressure through passage 118 to the main regulator valve 90, as discussed above, to<br>
determine whether the main regulator valve 90 performs variable modulation of line<br>
pressure or full modulation of line pressure. Pressure control solenoid PCS6 controls the<br>
engagement of clutch C6. Pressure control solenoid PCS TCC controls the engagement<br>
of the torque converter clutch TCC shown in Figure 1. The dashed lines in the chart of<br>
Figure 5 indicate that the respective pressure control solenoid and trim system are<br>
decoupled from the respective clutch. The column labeled "Exhaust" indicates, for each<br>
speed ratio range, clutches that are being exhausted through the logic valves. The<br>
remaining clutches that are not engaged are exhausted through the associated trim valves.<br><br>
Referring to Figures 3A and 3B, passages labeled "EX" indicate exhaust passages that<br>
allow pressurized fluid to exhaust, resulting in a non-pressurized state of passages and<br>
pressure switches in fluid communication with the exhaust passage.<br>
[0036]	Electrical signals are also sent to the electronic controller 84 based on<br>
fluid pressure in the hydraulic control portion 86 to provide feedback information such as<br>
information indicative of valve positions. The locations of various pressure switches<br>
which provide such feedback are indicated as pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5,<br>
PS6, PS7 and PS8 in Figures 3A and 3B. Each pressure switch can monitor and report a<br>
high logic state and a low logic state, corresponding with a relatively high pressure and<br>
low pressure, respectively, of the fluid at the switch. The pressure switches are<br>
configured to report the high logic state at or above a predetermined pressure and the low<br>
logic state below the predetermined pressure. Accordingly, as used herein, a "relatively<br>
high pressure" is a pressure at or above a predetermined pressure and a "relatively low<br>
pressure" is a pressure below the predetermined pressure. The ability to monitor the<br>
above-mentioned valves and detect a change, or lack of change, in valve position is of<br>
importance to provide continuous and reliable operation of the transmission 16.<br>
[0037]	The pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7, PS8, and the<br>
electronic controller 84 that analyses the state of the pressure switches form a diagnostic<br>
system for the transmission 16. Each pressure switch PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, PS5, PS6, PS7<br>
and PS8 is operatively connected with the controller 84 by a transfer conductor (e.g., an<br>
electrical wire) capable of carrying electrical signals therebetween. The controller 84<br>
contains data representing the expected logic state of each of the pressure switches in<br>
each of the speed ratio ranges in which the transmission 16 operates. If one or more of<br>
the pressure switches detects and reports a logic state to the controller 84 that does not<br>
correspond to the expected logic state of that particular pressure switch in the particular<br>
speed ratio in which the transmission 16 is operating, the controller 84 will determine<br>
whether it is necessary to shift the transmission 16 to a different speed ratio range,<br>
including to one of the predetermined drive-home modes (also referred to as failure<br>
modes), discussed below, until the transmission 16 can be maintenanced.<br><br>
[0038]	Those skilled in the art will understand the various fluid pressures<br>
resulting in the passages shown in Figures 3A and 3B and the affect on the positions of<br>
the trim valves, shift valves and logic valves, based on the chart of Figure 5. In the<br>
reverse speed ratio REV1, solenoids PCS1 and PCS3 are energized, and diagnostic<br>
pressure switches PS2, PS3 and PS5 report a high logic state. In the Neutral state,<br>
solenoids PCS1, PCS2, and PCS3 are energized and pressure switches PS3 and PS5<br>
report a high logic state. In the first forward speed ratio FWD1, solenoids SS1, PCS1,<br>
PCS2, PCS3 and PCS6 are energized, and diagnostic pressure switches PS3, PS5, PS6<br>
and PS7 report a high logic state. In the alternate second forward speed ratio ALT2,<br>
solenoids SS1, PCS2, PCS3 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS3, PS5 and PS7 report a high logic state. In the second forward speed<br>
ratio FWD2, solenoids PCS2, PCS3 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS3, PS5 and PS7 report a high logic state. In the third forward speed ratio<br>
FWD3, solenoids PCS2, PCS6 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS5, PS6 and PS7 report a high logic state. In the fourth forward speed<br>
ratio FWD4, solenoids PCS2, PCS4 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS1, PS4, PS5 and PS7 report a high logic state. In the alternate fourth forward<br>
speed ratio ALT4, solenoids SS1, PCS2, PCS4 and PCS TCC are energized, and<br>
diagnostic pressure switches PS1, PS4, PS5, PS7 and PS8 report a high logic state. In the<br>
fifth forward speed ratio FWD5, solenoids SS1, PCS2, PCS3 and PCS TCC are<br>
energized, and diagnostic pressure switches PS1, PS3, PS5, PS7 and PS8 report a high<br>
logic state. In the sixth forward speed ratio FWD6, solenoids SS1, and PCS TCC are<br>
energized, and diagnostic pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS5, PS7 and PS8 report a high<br>
logic state. In the seventh forward speed ratio FWD7, solenoids SS1, PCS1, PCS3 and<br>
PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure switches PS2, PS3, PS5, PS7 and PS8<br>
report a high logic state. In the alternate eighth forward speed ratio ALT8, solenoids<br>
SS1, PCS1, PCS4 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure switches PS2,<br>
PS4, PS5, PS7 and PS8 report a high logic state. In the eighth forward speed ratio<br>
FWD8, solenoids PCS1, PCS4 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS2, PS4, PS5 and PS8 report a high logic state. In the ninth forward speed<br><br>
ratio FWD9, solenoids PCS1, PCS6 and PCS TCC are energized, and diagnostic pressure<br>
switches PS2, PS5, PS6 and PS8 report a high logic state.<br>

respective one of the torque-transmitting mechanisms when in the first position than<br>
when in the second position;<br>
a main pressure source providing fluid at a main pressure;<br>
a control regulator valve in fluid communication with the main pressure<br>
source to regulate the main pressure to a control pressure;<br>
a shift valve (SV3) movable between a stroked position and an unstroked<br>
position;<br>
a spring urging the shift valve to the unstroked position; wherein the shift<br>
valve permits fluid at the main pressure and in fluid communication with the first piston<br>
area to the second piston area when in the unstroked position such that fluid pressure is<br>
applied to both of the piston areas to engage the torque-transmitting mechanism; wherein<br>
the shift valve blocks fluid at main pressure from the second piston area when in the<br>
stroked position such that fluid pressure is applied to only the first piston area to engage<br>
the torque-transmitting mechanism;<br>
an additional solenoid valve (SS1) in fluid communication with the shift<br>
valve and energizable to thereby direct fluid at the control pressure to the shift valve to<br>
further urge the shift valve to the unstroked position; and<br><br>
a logic valve (SV1) in fluid communication with the shift valve and<br>
selectively movable between a pressure-set position and a spring-set position.<br>
9.	The electro-hydraulic control system of claim 8, wherein the<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism with a dual-area piston is characterized by a first torque<br>
capacity when engaged by application of fluid to the first piston area and by a second<br>
torque capacity when engaged by application of fluid to the first and the second piston<br>
areas.<br>
10.	The electro-hydraulic control system in combination with a<br>
transmission of claim 8, further comprising:<br>
seven diagnostic pressure switches each in fluid communication with a<br>
different respective one of the trim valves or the logic valves and each having a high and<br>
a low logic state corresponding with the respective first and second positions of the trim<br>
valve or logic valve with which it is in fluid communication.<br>
11.	An electro-hydraulic control system for a multi-speed transmission<br>
having a plurality of torque-transmitting mechanisms including a selectively engagable<br>
torque-transmitting mechanism engagable by application of fluid pressure to a dual-area<br>
piston with a first piston area and a second piston area, and a source of pressurized fluid,<br>
comprising:<br>
a pressure control solenoid valve (PCS3);<br>
a trim valve (134) movable from a first position to a second position when<br>
the pressure control solenoid valve is energized;<br>
a shift-type solenoid valve (SS1);<br>
a shift valve (SV3) in fluid communication with the shift-type solenoid<br>
valve and with the second-piston area and selectively movable between a stroked position<br><br>
and an unstroked position; wherein the shift valve is in the unstroked position when the<br>
shift-type solenoid is energized;<br>
a first logic valve (SV2) in fluid communication with the trim valve, with<br>
the shift-type solenoid valve, with the shift valve, and with the first piston area;<br>
wherein the trim valve directs pressurized fluid to the first logic valve<br>
when the trim valve is in the second position; wherein the first logic valve is operable to<br>
direct the pressurized fluid to the first piston area when the trim valve is directing the<br>
pressurized fluid to the first logic valve; and wherein the shift valve blocks pressurized<br>
fluid directed to the first logic valve from reaching the second piston area when the shift<br>
valve is in a stroked position and allows pressurized fluid directed to the first logic valve<br>
to the second piston area when the shift valve is in an unstroked position.<br><br>
An electro-hydraulic control system is provided for a transmission with a torque-transmitting mechanism that has a dual area piston. When pressurized fluid is provided to a first of the two piston areas, the position of a spring-biased shift valve controls whether pressurized fluid communicates with the second piston area. A<br>
solenoid valve in fluid communication with the shift valve is energizable to direct<br>
pressurized fluid to the shift valve to urge the shift valve to the unstroked position to<br>
which the spring also urges. The shift valve may also be urged by pressurized fluid to<br>
the stroked position, but only when the solenoid valve is not energized. The spring<br>
maintains the shift valve in the unstroked position when pressurized fluid is directed to<br>
the shift valve to act both against and with the spring.</td>
