				<td>METHODS AND DOSAGE FORMS WITH MODIFIED VISCOSITY LAYERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention pertains to the controlled delivery of<br>
pharmaceutical agents and methods, dosage forms and devices. In particular,<br>
the invention is directed to methods, dosage forms and devices for the<br>
controlled delivery of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride. More particularly, the<br>
present invention pertains to methods of enhancing release rates by modifying<br>
the composition of core layers to alter the viscosity during operation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Traditional osmotic delivery devices control the rate of release<br>
from the dosage form through adjustments in the composition of the outer<br>
membrane in order to control the osmosis of fluid into the dosage form. The<br>
present invention takes advantage of the diffusional and viscous properties of<br>
the core layers in multilayer dosage forms to further define a particular delivery<br>
pattern. By manipulating the composition of the core layers to modify the<br>
viscosity of the layers during operation, enhanced release profiles are<br>
generated.<br>
[0003] The art is replete with descriptions of oral dosage forms for the<br>
controlled release of pharmaceutical agents. While a variety of sustained<br>
release dosage forms for delivering certain drugs exhibiting short half-life may<br>
be known, not every drug may be suitably delivered from those dosage forms<br>
because of solubility, metabolic processes, absorption and other physical,<br>
chemical and physiological parameters that may be unique to the drug and the<br>
mode of delivery. Examples of such drugs that are not likely candidates for<br>
controlled release dosage forms are those exhibiting a long half-life such as the<br>
tricyclic amine cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride.<br>
[0004] Similarly, cyclobenzaprine is relatively highly soluble in aqueous<br>
solutions providing greater difficulty in controlling it release from a dosage form<br>
over a prolonged period of time at a uniform rate of release. This is evident in<br>
the present invention where an initial bolus delivery is followed by a desired<br>
delay in delivery of active agent followed by an ascending rate of release of<br>
active agent at a uniform rate over a prolonged period of time. The high<br>
solubility of the active agent has provided difficulty in controlling for a desired<br>
delay.<br>
[0005] Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is indicated for treatment of<br>
muscle spasms associated with acute, painful muscoloskelatal conditions. It is<br>
freely soluble in water and alcohol, sparingly soluble in isopropanol, and<br>
insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents. Additionally, since cyclobenzaprine has a<br>
significantly long half-life (1-3 days) Physicians'Desk Reference, Thompson<br>
Healthcare, 56th Ed., pp. 572-573 (2002), and it is not a typical candidate for<br>
extended delivery. However, side effects such as drowsiness and dry mouth<br>
appear to be related to high blood plasma concentration levels restricting the<br>
ability to administer a single daily immediate release dose.<br>
[0006] Cyclobenzaprine, like other tricyclic amine salts such as<br>
amitriptyline, has reported side effects of sedation and dry mouth. It is<br>
expected that the side effects are likely a result of either rate of rise and/or<br>
actual drug blood plasma concentrations exceeding a threshold maximum<br>
tolerable concentration (MTC). However, in order to obtain a therapeutic<br>
effect, concentrations need to be sustained above a minimum<br>
pharmacodynamic concentration (MPC).<br>
[0007] Another aspect of delivery of cyclobenzaprine is that<br>
administration often requires high drug loading in the dosage form. Dosage<br>
forms may need to contain drug in the range of 20% to 90% of the overall<br>
weight of the dosage form. Such high drug loading requirements present<br>
problems in formulating compositions and fabricating dosage forms that are<br>
suitable for oral administration and can be swallowed without undue difficulty.<br>
Additionally, such loading requirements may present problems when<br>
formulating dosage forms that are administered a limited number of times per<br>
day, such as for once-a-day dosing, with a goal of release of active agent over<br>
a prolonged period of time.<br>
[0008] Exemplary controlled release dosage forms include, US Pat. No.<br>
5,536,507 which describes a three component pharmaceutical formulation that<br>
utilizes, inter alia, a pH sensitive polymer and optionally an osmotic agent that<br>
will swell in the higher pH regions of the lower portion of the small intestine and<br>
the large intestine to release drug in those environments. Additional<br>
components of the dosage form include a delayed release coating and an<br>
enteric coating to provide a dosage form that releases very little, if any, of the<br>
drug in the stomach, a relatively minimal amount in the small intestine and<br>
reportedly about 85% or more in the large intestine. Such a dosage form<br>
provides for a widely varying time-release of drug after administration that may<br>
not begin for 1-3 hours until the dosage form has passed from the stomach and<br>
an additional 3 hours or more for the dosage form to pass into the large<br>
intestine. <br>
[0009] Exemplary sustained release cyclobenzaprine dosage forms,<br>
methods of preparing such dosage forms and methods of using such dosage<br>
forms are described herein directed to osmotic dosage forms for oral<br>
administration.<br>
[00010] In addition to osmotic systems as described herein, however,<br>
there are many other approaches to achieving sustained release of drugs from<br>
oral dosage forms known in the art. These different approaches include, for<br>
example, diffusion systems such as reservoir devices and matrix devices,<br>
dissolution systems such as encapsulated dissolution systems (including, for<br>
example, "tiny time pills") and matrix dissolution systems, combination<br>
diffusion/dissolution systems and ion-exchange resin systems as described in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., pp. 1682-1685 (1990).<br>
Cyclobenzaprine dosage forms that operate in accord with these other<br>
approaches are encompassed by the scope of the disclosure herein to the<br>
extent that the drug release characteristics and/or the blood plasma<br>
cyclobenzaprine concentration characteristics as recited herein and in the<br>
claims describe those dosage forms either literally or equivalently.<br>
[00011] Osmotic dosage forms in general utilize osmotic pressure to<br>
generate a driving force for imbibing fluid into a compartment formed, at least<br>
in part, by a semipermeable membrane that permits free diffusion of fluid but<br>
not drug or osmotic agent(s), if present. A significant advantage to osmotic<br>
systems is that operation is pH-independent and thus continues at the<br>
osmotically determined rate throughout an extended time period even as the<br>
dosage form transits the gastrointestinal tract and encounters differing<br>
microenvironments having significantly different pH values. A review of such<br>
dosage forms is found in Santus and Baker, "Osmotic drug delivery: a review of<br>
the patent literature," Journal of Controlled Release 35 (1995) 1-21,<br>
incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. In particular, the following U.S.<br>

5,019,397; and 5,156,850.<br>
[00012] Devices in which a drug composition is delivered as a slurry,<br>
suspension or solution from a small exit orifice by the action of an expandable<br>
layer are described in U. S. Patents Nos. 5,633,011; 5,190,765; 5,252,338;<br>
5,620,705; 4,931,285; 5,006,346; 5,024,842; and 5,160,743. Typical devices<br>
include an expandable push layer and a drug layer surrounded by a<br>
semipermeable membrane. In certain instances, the drug layer is provided<br>
with a subcoat to delay release of the drug composition to the environment of<br>
use or to form an annealed coating in conjunction with the semipermeable<br>
membrane.<br>
[00013] Devices in which a drug composition is delivered in a dry state<br>
from a large exit orifice by the action of an expandable layer are described in<br>
US Patent Nos. 4,892,778, 4,915,949 and 4,940,465. Those references<br>
describe a dispenser for delivering a beneficial agent to an environment of use<br>
that includes a semipermeable wall containing a layer of expandable material<br>
that pushes a dry drug layer out of the compartment formed by the wall. The<br>
exit orifice in the device is substantially the same diameter as the inner<br>
diameter of the compartment formed by the wall.<br>
[00014] While dosage forms delivering the drug composition to the<br>
environment of use in the dry state may provide suitable release of drug at high<br>
drug loading over a prolonged period of time, the exposure of the drug layer to<br>
the environment of use may result in agitation-dependent release of drug that<br>
in some circumstances is difficult to control. Accordingly, it may be<br>
advantageous to release the drug as a slurry or suspension that may be<br>
metered by control of rate of expansion of the push layer and the size of the<br>
exit orifice in the dosage form as in accordance with this invention.<br>
[00015] US Patent 5,169,638 describes a buoyant controlled release<br>
pharmaceutical powder formulation to be filled into capsules that uses a pH<br>
dependent polymer formed from alginic acid and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose<br>
to release Pharmaceuticals at a controlled rate. It appears that this capsule<br>
formulation was intended to mimic the characteristics of a tableted formulation.<br>
No description is provided of a formulation that provides the uniform release<br>
characteristics of the dosage forms containing cyclobenzaprine and related<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
[00016] US Patent Nos. 4,892,778 and 4,940,465, describe a dispenser<br>
for delivering a beneficial agent to an environment of use that includes a<br>
semipermeable wall containing a layer of expandable material that pushes a<br>
drug layer out of the compartment formed by the wall. The exit orifice in the<br>
device is substantially the same diameter as the inner diameter of the<br>
compartment formed by the wall.<br>
[00017] US Patent No. 4,915,949, describes a dispenser for delivering a<br>
beneficial agent to an environment of use that includes a semipermeable wall<br>
containing a layer of expandable material that pushes a drug layer out of the<br>
compartment formed by the wall. The drug layer contains discrete tiny pills<br>
dispersed in a carrier. The exit orifice in the device is substantially the same<br>
diameter as the inner diameter of the compartment formed by the wall.<br>
[00018] US Patent No. 5,126,142, describes a device for delivering an<br>
ionophore to livestock that includes a semipermeable housing in which a<br>
composition containing the ionophore and a carrier and an expandable<br>
hydrophilic layer is located, along with an additional element that imparts<br>
sufficient density to the device to retain it in the rumen-reticular sac of a<br>
ruminant animal. The ionophore and carrier are present in a dry state during<br>
storage and the composition changes to a dispensable, fluid-like state when it<br>
is in contact with the fluid environment of use. A number of different exit<br>
arrangements are described, including a plurality of holes in the end of the<br>
device and a single exit of varying diameter to control the amount of drug<br>
released per unit time due to diffusion and osmotic pumping.<br>
[00019] The prior art is notably silent on taking advantage of the<br>
diffusional and relative viscosity properties of the core layers. Prior art osmotic<br>
systems while providing advantageous controlled delivery over a prolonged<br>
period of time, suffered from periods of inconsistent delivery resulting in<br>
bumps, increases or decreases, in the release rate profile. Such bumps can<br>
' adversely impact blood plasma concentrations. The present invention is able<br>
to modify the release rate to provide for more uniform delivery, reducing these<br>
bumps.<br>
[00020] Although, as described above, there are a variety of sustained<br>
release dosage forms for delivering certain drugs, not every drug may be<br>
suitably delivered from those dosage forms because of solubility, metabolic<br>
processes, absorption and other physical, chemical and physiological<br>
parameters that may be unique to the drug and the mode of delivery.<br>
[00021] There remains a need for effective dosing methods, dosage<br>
forms and devices that will permit the controlled release of the aforementioned<br>
compound over a prolonged period of time while reducing undesirable<br>
increases or decreases in release rate during operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00022] The present invention is designed for once-a-day administration<br>
of a dosage form to deliver cyclobenzaprine HCI for approximately 20 hours<br>
utilizing a capsule-shaped tablet with an optional drug overcoat. This<br>
approximately 20 hours of release is comprised of the immediate release drug<br>
overcoat delivery followed by no further drug delivery for about four hours after<br>
administration until the core releases drug in a controlled fashion for about 16<br>
hours. This novel profile provides therapeutic delivery while the delay in drug<br>
delivery keeps the plasma levels low enough such that side effects are reduced<br>
and the development of tolerance is increased. This delivery profile provides<br>
24 hours of efficacy without high plasma levels.<br>
[00023] The present invention capitalizes upon diffusional and viscous<br>
properties of the core layers to develop greater uniformity in the drug release<br>
rate and a more predictable delay period marked by greater demarcation of the<br>
end of the delay period and beginning of drug delivery from the core. By<br>
controlling the delay layer and drug layer formulations such that the delay layer<br>
viscosity remains higher than the drug layer viscosity during the desired delay<br>
period, premature tunneling of the drug layer through the delay layer can be<br>
reduced in order to provide the optimal drug-free release period followed by a<br>
continuous and substantially ascending release from the core. Premature<br>
tunneling allows the drug layer to be prematurely delivered from the system<br>
resulting in fluctuations in the release rate during the ascending release rate<br>
period.<br>
[00024] Prior multilayer formulations are characterized by having a first<br>
layer viscosity during operation of less than the second layer.<br>
[00025] The present invention provides for a modulated release rate that<br>
is neither ascending, flat or delayed, but rather a hybrid. It has been<br>
surprisingly discovered that the instant profile should provide efficacious<br>
therapy over 24 hours while reducing negative side effects associated with<br>
administration of the drug. Additionally, while cyclobenzaprine is exemplified<br>
herein, the present invention would be equally beneficial to delivery of other<br>
drugs in the tricyclic amine antidepressant class including amitriptyline,<br>
imipramine and desipramine.<br>
[00026] The present invention utilizes a rapid initial bolus delivery where<br>
the drug is delivered in the upper gastrointestinal (Gl) tract, followed by a delay<br>
in delivery of drug for about four hours followed by a slow, but substantially<br>
ascending, release when the dosage form is likely to be in the colonic region of<br>
the Gl tract. This profile was not previously used to deliver any drug, especially<br>
cyclobenzaprine and is designed to reduce the impairment of a subjects'<br>
cognitive functions.<br>
[00027] It has been surprisingly found that the described modulated<br>
release rate provides for a substantially ascending blood plasma concentration<br>
of drug with peak concentration occurring at about 20 hours after<br>
administration. This ascending blood plasma concentration should reduce the<br>
intraday tolerance effect developed.<br>
[00028] The dosage form utilizes a semipermeable membrane<br>
surrounding a three-layer core: the first layer is referred to as a delay layer and<br>
contains no drug; the second layer referred to as the drug layer contains drug<br>
such as cyclobenzaprine HCI and excipients; and the third layer referred to as<br>
the push layer contains osmotic agents and no drug. An orifice is drilled<br>
through the membrane on the delay-layer end of the capsule-shaped tablet.<br>
An exterior drug overcoat is applied to the membrane.<br>
[00029] In the aqueous environment of the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract, the<br>
drug overcoat dissolves. Then, water is imbibed through the semipermeable<br>
membrane at a controlled rate determined by the properties of the membrane<br>
and the osmolality of the core consitituents. This causes the push layer to<br>
swell and the delay and drug layers to hydrate and form viscous, but<br>
deformable, masses. The push layer expands against the drug layer, which in<br>
turn pushes against the hydrated delay layer. Preferably, the delay layer,<br>
followed by the drug layer, exits the system through the orifice in the<br>
membrane at the same rate that water is imbibed into the core. In traditional<br>
systems, the drug layer may tunnel through the delay layer and alter the<br>
release rate profile. The biologically inert components of the tablet remain<br>
intact during the Gl transit and are eliminated as a shell along with insoluble<br>
core components.<br>
[00030] As the active drug is relatively highly soluble in an aqueous<br>
environment, the drug layer has a tendency to mix into the delay layer.<br>
Depending upon the relative viscosity of the drug and delay layers, different<br>
release profiles are obtained. It is imperative to identify the optimum viscosity<br>
for each drug layer. It has been found that the optimum viscosity of the layers<br>
should be between 70 cps and 350 cps and preferably between about 84 cps<br>
and 158 cps and more preferably about 109 cps.<br>
[00031] In order to maintain the delay period of the present preferred<br>
delivery profile with no drug delivery for the desired duration, mixing is to be<br>
reduced. It has been discovered that it is preferable to create a dosage form<br>
wherein the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer remains higher than the<br>
viscosity of the hydrated drug layer throughout the delay period. Such a<br>
relative viscosity deters premature mixing and tunneling by the drug layer into<br>
the delay layer and provides a sharper demarcation between the end of the<br>
delay period and the beginning of the ascending release period as well as<br>
providing a more uniform delivery from the dosage form during the ascending<br>
release period.<br>
[00032] However, it is also within the scope of the present invention to<br>
have both a hydrated delay layer and a hydrated drug layer with a viscosity that<br>
is substantially similar. This is accomplished using the same or similar material<br>
in both the delay layer and the drug layer. And, this is preferably accomplished<br>
using the same or similar percentage of this material in both the delay layer<br>
and the drug layer. One example in accordance with the present invention is to<br>
use the same grade of Polyox® WSR N-150 and same percentage of Polyox®<br>
WSR N-150 in both the delay layer and the drug layer. Accordingly, in this<br>
approach, the objective is to have a minimal differential in viscosity between<br>
the delay layer and the drug layer. Thus, it is also acceptable to use different<br>
materials, different grades of material or even different percentages of a<br>
material in both the delay layer and the drug layer so long as there is a minimal<br>
difference in the respective viscosities of the delay layer and the drug layer.<br>
[00033] Additionally, it is also within the scope of the present invention to<br>
have a notable, distinctive or substantial difference between the viscosity of the<br>
hydrated delay layer and the viscosity of the drug layer where the viscosity of<br>
the hydrated delay layer is less than the viscosity of the drug layer. Thus, this is<br>
accomplished by using different materials, different grades of material or even<br>
different percentages of a material in both the delay layer and the drug layer so<br>
long as there is a resulting notable, distinctive or substantial difference in the<br>
respective viscosities of the delay layer and the drug layer.<br>
[00034] Accordingly, in accordance with the present invention the relative<br>
viscosities of the delay layer and drug layer are either higher, lower or the<br>
same or substantially similar.<br>
[00035] The delivery profile from the core is also dependent upon the<br>
weight and thickness of each of the core layers. Increasing the thickness or<br>
weight of a particular layer increases the delivery time for that portion of the<br>
profile. For example, a thicker delay layer provides a longer duration of delay<br>
before delivery of active agent from the core commences.<br>
[00036] The ratio of core diameter to core length is also an important<br>
factor. For example, a narrower core shape provides a shorter period of mixing<br>
of the adjacent layers thus a steeper ascending rate, from low release rate to<br>
higher release rate of active agent, while a wider core diameter provides a<br>
larger interface area for mixing between adjacent layers providing a shallower<br>
ascending rate. The shape of the system as a capsule shaped tablet is an<br>
important feature that is responsible for providing the somewhat ascending<br>
profile from the core. Thus, the shape can vary between a capsule shaped<br>
tablet to a standard biconvex shape, with a concomitant change in delivery<br>
profile.<br>
[00037] The delivery system is designed to achieve plasma<br>
concentrations of approximately 6 to 8 ng/ml, and preferably between 6.5 ng/ml<br>
and 6.9 ng/ml, three to four hours after dosing and approximately 8 to 12<br>
ng/ml, and preferably between 9.7 ng/ml and 10.2 ng/ml, eighteen to twenty<br>
hours after administration of a single 22.5mg dosage form. Peak<br>
concentrations occur at approximately twenty hours. Other doses are<br>
expected to result in approximately linear fluctuations, higher or lower, in blood<br>
plasma concentrations.<br>
[00038] The present invention is designed to be a once-a-day dosage<br>
form that is therapeutically effective while producing fewer side effects than<br>
immediate release dosage forms presently administered multiple times per<br>
day. The present invention provides two key features: a modulated delivery<br>
that affects the pharmacodynamics and development of tolerance, and the<br>
modulated delivery provides adequate blood plasma concentrations for<br>
therapeutic effect. The modulated delivery allows a sustained concentration<br>
profile above the MPC but does not exceed the MTC. Development of<br>
tolerance is related to the sedation effects (an impairment of the cognitive<br>
function as measured by a representative measure such as digit vigilance).<br>
[00039] In one aspect, the invention comprises layer compositions to<br>
control the viscosity of the layers during operation to enhance the demarcation<br>
of the delay and release periods.<br>
[00040] In one aspect, the invention comprises a sustained release<br>
dosage form adapted to release over a prolonged period of time at a<br>
modulated rate of release, the compound cyclobenzaprine.<br>
[00041] In another aspect, the present invention comprises a means of<br>
maintaining a uniform release rate after a delay period of no drug delivery from<br>
the dosage form by controlling the viscosity of the hydrated drug layer and the<br>

hour period after administration of the dosage form the quotient formed by<br>
[Cmax - Cmin]/Cmin is less than 1. The Cmax occurs at a time greater than about<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00058] The present invention is best understood by reference to the<br>
following definitions, the drawings and exemplary disclosure provided herein.<br>
Definitions<br>
[00059] By "dosage form" is meant a pharmaceutical composition or<br>
device comprising a pharmaceutically active agent, such as cyclobenzaprine or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, the composition or<br>
device optionally containing inactive ingredients, i.e., pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients such as suspending agents, surfactants, disintegrants,<br>
binders, diluents, lubricants, stabilizers, antioxidants, osmotic agents,<br>
colorants, plasticizers, coatings and the like, that are used to manufacture and<br>
deliver active pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[00060] By "active agent", "drug", or "compound" is meant an agent, drug,<br>
or compound having the characteristics of cyclobenzaprine or a<br>
pharmaceuticaHy acceptable acid addition salt thereof.<br>
[00061] By "pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition salt" or<br>
"pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salt", which are used interchangeably herein, are<br>
meant those salts in which the anion does not contribute significantly to the<br>
toxicity or pharmacological activity of the salt, and, as such, they are the<br>
pharmacological equivalents of the bases of the cyclobenzaprine compound,<br>
included as we!! are other tricyclic amine antidepressants of which<br>
cyclobenzaprine is representative. Examples of pharmaceuticaHy acceptable<br>
acids that are useful for the purposes of salt formation include but are not<br>
limited to hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, citric, acetic, benzoic,<br>
mandelic, phosphoric, nitric, mucic, isethionic, palmitic, and others.<br>
[00062] By "sustained release" is meant a predetermined continuous<br>
release of active agent to an environment over a prolonged period.<br>
[00063] The expressions "exit," "exit orifice," "delivery orifice" or "drug<br>
delivery orifice," and other similar expressions, as may be used herein include<br>
a member selected from the group consisting of a passageway; an aperture;<br>
an orifice; and a bore. The expression also includes an orifice that is formed or<br>
formable from a substance or polymer that erodes, dissolves or is leached from<br>
the outer wall to thereby form an exit orifice.<br>
[00064] A drug "release rate" refers to the quantity of drug released from<br>
a dosage form per unit time, e.g., milligrams of drug released per hour (mg/hr).<br>
Drug release rates for drug dosage forms are typically measured as an in vitro<br>
rate of dissolution, i.e., a quantity of drug released from the dosage form per<br>
unit time measured under appropriate conditions and in a suitable fluid. The<br>
dissolution tests described herein were performed on dosage forms placed in<br>
metal coil sample holders attached to a USP Type VII bath indexer in a<br>
constant temperature water bath at 37°C. Aliquots of the release rate solutions<br>
were injected into a chromatographic system to quantify the amounts of drug<br>
released during the testing intervals.<br>
[00065] By "release rate assay" is meant a standardized assay for the<br>
determination of the release rate of a compound from the dosage form tested<br>
using a USP Type VII interval release apparatus. It is understood that<br>
reagents of equivalent grade may be substituted in the assay in accordance<br>
with generally-accepted procedures.<br>
[00066] For clarity and convenience herein, the convention is utilized of<br>
designating the time of drug administration as zero hours (t - 0 hours) and<br>
times following administration in appropriate time units, e.g., t = 30 minutes or t<br>
= 2 hours, etc.<br>
[00067] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, a drug release rate<br>
obtained at a specified time "following administration" refers to the in vitro drug<br>
release rate obtained at the specified time following implementation of an<br>
appropriate dissolution test. The time at which a specified percentage of the<br>
drug within a dosage form has been released may be referenced as the Tx"<br>
value, where V is the percent of drug that has been released. For example, a<br>
commonly used reference measurement for evaluating drug release from<br>
dosage forms is the time at which 70% or 90% of drug within the dosage form<br>
has been released. This measurement is referred to as the T70" or "T90" for<br>
the dosage form.<br>
[00068] By "immediate-release dosage form" is meant a dosage form<br>
that releases drug substantially completely within a short time period following<br>
administration, i.e., generally within a few minutes to about 1 hour.<br>
[00069] By "extended release dosage form" or "controlled release dosage<br>
form" is meant a dosage form that releases drug in a substantially consistent<br>
predetermined rate for many hours. Controlled release dosage forms in accord<br>
with the present invention exhibit T90 values of at least about 16 hours or more<br>
and preferably about 18 hours or more. The dosage forms release drug over<br>
periods of time of at least about 10 hours, preferably 12 hours or more and,<br>
more preferably, 16-20 hours or more.<br>
[00070] By "sustained release dosage form" is meant a dosage form that<br>
releases drug substantially continuously for many hours. Sustained release<br>
dosage forms of the present invention release drug over periods of time of at<br>
least about 10 hours, preferably about 12 hours or more and, more preferably,<br>
about 16 hours or more.<br>
[00071] Dosage forms in accord with the present invention exhibit<br>
controlled release rates of cyclobenzaprine for a prolonged period of time.<br>
[00072] By "uniform release rate" is meant an average hourly release rate<br>
from the core that varies positively or negatively by no more than about 30%<br>
and preferably no more than about 25%, most preferably no more than about<br>
10%, from either the preceding or the subsequent average hourly release rate<br>
as determined in a (JSP Type VII Interval Release Apparatus where the<br>
cumulative release is between 25% and 75%.<br>
[00073] By "prolonged period of time" is meant a continuous period of<br>
time of at least about 4 hours, preferably 6-8 hours or more and, more<br>
preferably, 10 hours or more. For example, the exemplary osmotic dosage<br>
forms described herein generally begin releasing cyclobenzaprine at a uniform<br>
release rate at about 4 hours following administration and the uniform rate of<br>
release, as defined above, continues for a prolonged period of time from about<br>
25% to until at least about 75% and preferably at least about 85% of the drug<br>
is released from the dosage form. Release of cyclobenzaprine continues<br>
thereafter for several more hours although the rate of release is generally<br>
slowed somewhat from the uniform release rate.<br>
[00074] By "C" is meant the concentration of drug in the blood plasma of<br>
a subject, generally expressed as mass per unit volume, typically nanograms<br>
per milliliter. For convenience, this concentration may be referred to as<br>
"plasma drug concentration" or "plasma concentration" herein which is intended<br>
to be inclusive of drug concentration measured in any appropriate body fluid or<br>
tissue. The plasma drug concentration at any time following drug<br>
administration is referenced as Ctime, as in Cgh or C24h, etc.<br>
[00075] By "steady state" is meant the condition in which the amount of<br>
drug present in the blood plasma of a subject does not vary significantly over a<br>
prolonged period of time. A pattern of drug accumulation following continuous<br>
administration of a constant dose and dosage form at constant dosing intervals<br>
eventually achieves a "steady-state" where the plasma concentration peaks<br>
and plasma concentration troughs are essentially identical within each dosing<br>
interval. As used herein, the steady-state maximal (peak) plasma drug<br>
concentration is referenced as Cmax and the minimal (trough) plasma drug<br>
concentration is referenced as Cmin. The times following drug administration a<br>
which the steady-state peak plasma and trough drug concentrations occur are<br>
referenced as the Tmax and the Tmin, respectively.<br>
[00076] Persons of skill in the art appreciate that plasma drug<br>
concentrations obtained in individual subjects will vary due to inter-patient<br>
variability in the many parameters affecting drug absorption, distribution,<br>
metabolism and excretion. For this reason, unless otherwise indicated, mean<br>
values obtained from groups of subjects are used herein for purposes of<br>
comparing plasma drug concentration data and for analyzing relationships<br>
between in vitro dosage form dissolution rates and in vivo plasma drug<br>
concentrations.<br>
[00077] It has been surprisingly discovered that sustained release<br>
cyclobenzaprine dosage forms exhibiting T90 values of 13-15 hours or more<br>
and more preferably 16-18 hours or more and which release cyclobenzaprine<br>
at a controlled release rate for a prolonged period of time can be prepared.<br>
Administration of such dosage forms once daily provides therapeutically<br>
effective average steady-state plasma cyclobenzaprine concentrations.<br>
[00078] The exemplary sustained release cyclobenzaprine dosage forms,<br>
methods of preparing such dosage forms and methods of using such dosage<br>
forms described herein are directed to osmotic dosage forms for oral<br>
administration. In addition to osmotic systems as described herein, however,<br>
there are many other approaches to achieving sustained release of drugs from<br>
oral dosage forms known in the art. These different approaches may include,<br>
for example, diffusion systems such as reservoir devices and matrix devices,<br>
dissolution systems such as encapsulated dissolution systems (including, for<br>
example, "tiny time pills") and matrix dissolution systems, combination<br>
diffusion/dissolution systems and ion-exchange resin systems as described in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., pp. 1682-1685 (1990).<br>
Cyclobenzaprine dosage forms that operate in accord with these other<br>
approaches are encompassed by the scope of the claims below to the extent<br>
that the drug release characteristics and/or the plasma cyclobenzaprine<br>
concentration characteristics as recited in the claims describe those dosage<br>
forms either literally or equivalently.<br>
[00079] Osmotic dosage forms, in general, utilize osmotic pressure to<br>
generate a driving force for imbibing fluid into a compartment formed, at least<br>
in part, by a semipermeable wall that permits free diffusion of fluid but not drug<br>
or osmotic agent(s), if present. A significant advantage to osmotic systems is<br>
that operation is pH-independent and thus continues at the osmotically<br>
determined rate throughout an extended time period even as the dosage form<br>
transits the gastrointestinal tract and encounters differing microenvironments<br>
having significantly different pH values. A review of such dosage forms is<br>
found in Santus and Baker, "Osmotic drug delivery: a review of the patent<br>
literature," Journal of Controlled Release 35 (1995) 1 -21. In particular, the<br>
following U.S. Patents, owned by the assignee of the present application, ALZA<br>
Corporation, directed to osmotic dosage forms: Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899;<br>
3,995,631; 4,008,719; 4,111,202; 4,160,020; 4,327,725; 4,519,801; 4,578,075;<br>
4,681,583; 5,019,397; and 5,156,850.<br>
[00080] The present invention improves the uniform release rate of a<br>
system having multiple layers by controlling the premature mixing and<br>
tunneling of subsequent layers into prior layers.<br>
[00081] Figure 1 is a cutaway view of a capsule shaped tablet<br>
embodiment of dosage form 10 in accord with the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the internal compartment defined by membrane 20 contains a<br>
multilayer-compressed core having a first component non-drug delay layer 30,<br>
a second component drug layer 40 and a third component push layer 50.<br>
[00082] Figure 2 illustrates an alternate standard biconvex shape tablet.<br>
While the preferred embodiment in Figure 1 illustrates a capsule-shaped tablet,<br>
the tablet geometry may be other shapes including a standard biconvex shape<br>
as illustrated in Figure 2. However, alternate shapes will alter release rates.<br>
[00083] In operation, following oral ingestion of dosage form 10, the<br>
osmotic activity gradient across wall 20 causes gastric fluid to be imbibed<br>
through wall 20 thereby converting delay layer 30 and drug layer 40 into<br>
deliverable compositions, i.e. solutions or suspensions, and concurrently<br>
swelling the osmopolymer(s) in push layer 50. The deliverable delay layer 30<br>
and drug layer 40 are released sequentially through exit 60 as fluid continues<br>
to enter the internal compartment and push layer 50 continues to swell. As<br>
release of delay layer 30 and drug layer 40 occurs, fluid continues to be<br>
imbibed and push layer 50 continues to swell thereby driving continued<br>
release. In this manner, drug is released in a continuous and uniform manner<br>
over an extended time period after a predetermined delay time.<br>
[00084] Figure 4 illustrates a model release rate profile for a 22.5 mg<br>
target system including an immediate release overcoat. The desired distinct<br>
demarcation of the beginning and ending points of the delay period and<br>
release periods are demonstrated herein.<br>
[00085] Figure 5 illustrates blood plasma concentration profiles including<br>
a model profile for a 22.5 mg target system having an immediate release<br>
overcoat. The desired uniform ascending concentration is demonstrated<br>
herein.<br>
[00086] As described in more detail below, third component push layer 50<br>
comprises osmotically active component(s), but does not contain active drug.<br>
The osmotically active component(s) in push layer 50 typically comprise an<br>
osmagent and one or more osmopolymer(s) having relatively large molecular<br>
weights which exhibit swelling as fluid is imbibed such that significant release<br>
of these osmopolymers through exit 60 does not occur. Additional excipients<br>
such as binders, lubricants, antioxidants and colorants may also be included in<br>
push layer 50. The third component layer is referred to herein as an<br>
expandable or a push layer since, as fluid is imbibed, the osmopolymer(s) swell<br>
and push against the deliverable drug formulation of the second component<br>
drug layer to thereby facilitate release of the drug formulation from the dosage<br>
form.<br>
[00087] Delay layer 30 comprises osmotically active components, but<br>
does not contain drug. The osmotically active component(s) in the first<br>
component delay layer typically comprise an osmagent and one or more<br>
osmopolymer(s) having relatively small molecular weights which exhibit<br>
swelling as fluid is imbibed such that release of these osmopolymers through<br>
exit 60 occurs similar to that of drug layer 40. Additional excipients such as<br>
binders, lubricants, antioxidants and colorants may also be included in delay<br>
layer 30. The first component layer is referred to herein as a delay layer since,<br>
as fluid is imbibed, the layer hydrates and is delivered without any active drug<br>
released from the core prior to release of drug layer 40, thereby creating a<br>
predetermined delay in release of drug layer 40 from the dosage form.<br>
Maintaining the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer greater than the viscosity<br>
of the hydrated drug layer throughout the delay period assists in assuring that<br>
minimal active drug is released from the core during the predetermined delay<br>
period.<br>
[00088] Drug layer 40 comprises cyclobenzaprine in an admixture with<br>
selected excipients adapted to provide an osmotic activity gradient for driving<br>
fluid from an external environment through membrane 20 and for forming a<br>
deliverable drug formulation upon imbibition of fluid. The excipients may<br>
include a suitable suspending agent, also referred to herein as a drug carrier,<br>
and an osmotically active agent, i.e., an "osmagent." Other excipients such as<br>
lubricants, binders, etc. may also be included.<br>
[00089] Drug layer 40 further comprises a hydrophilic polymer carrier.<br>
The hydrophilic polymer provides a particle in the drug composition that<br>
contributes to the controlled delivery of the active drug. Representative<br>
examples of these polymers are poly(alkylene oxide) of 100,000 to 750,000<br>
number-average molecular weight, including poly(ethylene oxide),<br>
poly(methylene oxide), poly(butylene oxide) and poly(hexylene oxide); and a<br>
poly(carboxymethylcellulose) of 40,000 to 400,000 number-average molecular<br>
weight, represented by poly(alkali carboxymethylcellulose), poly(sodium<br>
carboxymethylcellulose), poly(potassium carboxymethylcellulose) and<br>
poly(lithium carboxymethylcellulose). Drug layer 40 can further comprise a<br>
hydroxypropylalkylcellulose of 9,200 to 125,000 number-average molecular<br>
weight for enhancing the delivery properties of the dosage form as represented<br>
by hydroxypropylethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylbutylcellulose and hydroxypropylpentylcellulose; and a<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) of 7,000 to 75,000 number-average molecular weight for<br>
enhancing the flow properties of the dosage form. Preferred among these<br>
polymers are the poly(ethylene oxide) of 100,000 - 300,000 number average<br>
molecular weight. Carriers that erode in the gastric environment, i.e.,<br>
bioerodible carriers, are especially preferred.<br>
[00090] Other carriers that may be incorporated into drug layer 40 include<br>
carbohydrates that exhibit sufficient osmotic activity to be used alone or with<br>
other osmagents., Such carbohydrates comprise monosaccharides,<br>
disaccharides and polysaccharides. Representative examples include<br>
maltodextrins (i.e., glucose polymers produced by the hydrolysis of com starch)<br>
and the sugars comprising lactose, glucose, raffinose, sucrose, mannitol,<br>
sorbitol, and the like. Preferred maltodextrins are those having a dextrose<br>
equivalence (DE) of 20 or less, preferably with a DE ranging from about 4 to<br>
about 20, and often 9-20. Maltodextrin having a DE of 9-12 has been found to<br>
be useful.<br>
[00091] Drug layer 40 typically will be a substantially dry, 
weight, composition formed by compression of the carrier, the drug, and other<br>
excipients as one layer.<br>
[00092] Drug layer 40 may be formed from particles by comminution that<br>
produces the size of the drug and the size of the accompanying polymer used<br>
in the fabrication of the drug layer, typically as a core containing the compound,<br>
according to the mode and the manner of the invention. The means for<br>
producing particles include granulation, spray drying, sieving, lyophilization,<br>
crushing, grinding, jet milling, micronizing and chopping to produce the<br>
intended micron particle size. The process can be performed by size reduction<br>
equipment, such as a micropulverizer mill, a fluid energy grinding mill, a<br>
grinding mill, a roller mill, a hammer mill, an attrition mill, a chaser mill, a ball<br>
mill, a vibrating ball mill, an impact pulverizer mill, a centrifugal pulverizer, a<br>
coarse crusher and a fine crusher. The size of the particle can be ascertained<br>
by screening, including a grizzly screen, a flat screen, a vibrating screen, a<br>
revolving screen, a shaking screen, an oscillating screen and a reciprocating<br>
screen. The processes and equipment for preparing drug and carrier particles<br>
are disclosed in Pharmaceutical Sciences. Remington, 18th Ed., pp. 1615-<br>
1632 (1990); Chemical Engineers Handbook. Perry, 6th Ed., pp. 21-13 to 21-<br>
19 (1984); Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Parrot, Vol. 61, No. 6, pp. 813-<br>
829 (1974); and Chemical Engineer, Hixon, pp. 94-103 (1990).<br>
[00093] Optionally, surfactants and disintegrants may be utilized in the<br>
drug layer. Exemplary of the surfactants are those having an HLB value of<br>
between about 10-25, such as polyethylene glycol 400 monostearate,<br>
polyoxyethylene-4-sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan<br>
monooleate, polyoxyethylene-20-sorbitan monopalmitate, polyoxyethylene-20-<br>
monolaurate, polyoxyethylene-40 -stearate, sodium oleate and the like.<br>
Disintegrants may be selected from starches, clays, celluloses, algins and<br>
gums and crosslinked starches, celluloses and polymers. Representative<br>
disintegrants include corn starch, potato starch, croscarmelose, crospovidone,<br>
sodium starch glycolate, Veegum HV, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginic acid, guar gum and the like.<br>
[00094] The active compound may be provided in the drug layer in<br>
amounts of from 1 mg to 100 mg per dosage form, preferably 10mg - 40mg<br>
per dosage form, depending upon the required dosing level that must be<br>
maintained over the delivery period, i.e., the time between consecutive<br>
administrations of the dosage forms. More typically, loading of compound in<br>
the dosage forms will provide doses of compound to the subject ranging from<br>
10 mg to 60 mg per day, more usually 20 mg to 40 mg per day. Generally, if a<br>
total drug dose of more than 100 mg per day is required, multiple units of the<br>
dosage form may be administered at the same time to provide the required<br>
amount of drug.<br>
[00095] As a representative compound of the compounds having muscle<br>
relaxing activity described herein, immediate release cyclobenzaprine is<br>
typically administered at a starting dose of 10 mg, administered three times per<br>
day. The effective dose range has been determined to be generally 20 mg/day<br>
to 60 mg/day.<br>
[00096] Blood plasma concentrations in a subject may be determined by<br>
clinical assay to determine a correlation between tolerability and clinical effect<br>
and blood plasma concentrations of drug. Plasma concentrations may range<br>
from 3 ng/ml to100 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter), more typically 4 ng/ml to<br>
40 ng/ml, of compound. The present invention provides for a period of delivery<br>
utilizing a substantially ascending blood plasma concentration profile.<br>
[00097] Figure 6 illustrates blood plasma concentrations at various times<br>
achieved through various means of delivery. This figure illustrates the time<br>
necessary to achieve a particular blood plasma concentration.<br>
[00098] Figure 7 illustrates the affect of cyclobenzaprine on cognitive<br>
ability following various cyclobenzaprine treatments and the impairment<br>
associated with high concentrations of cyclobenzaprine.<br>
[00099] In presently preferred embodiments of once-a-day dosage forms<br>
in accord with the present invention, the drug layer comprises cyclobenzaprine<br>
in a dose of 10 mg to 40 mg cyclobenzaprine per dosage form.<br>
[000100] Dosage forms of the present invention have core drug release T90<br>
values of greater than 12 hours, preferably greater than 16 hours and most<br>
preferably greater than 18 hours, and released cyclobenzaprine for a<br>
continuous period of time of about 20. After about four hours following<br>
administration, the dosage form releases cyclobenzaprine from the core at a<br>
substantially ascending rate of release that continues for a prolonged period of<br>
time of about 16 hours or more. This release in the preferred embodiment<br>
occurred subsequent to release of the immediate release coating and the delay<br>
layer.<br>
[000101] Wall 20 is formed to be permeable to the passage of an external<br>
fluid, such as water and biological fluids, and is substantially impermeable to<br>
the passage of cyclobenzaprine, osmagent, osmopolymer and the like. As<br>
such, it is semipermeable. The selectively semipermeable compositions used<br>
for forming wall 20 are essentially nonerodible and substantially insoluble in<br>
biological fluids during the life of the dosage form.<br>
[000102] Representative polymers for forming wall 20 comprise<br>
semipermeable homopolymers, semipermeable copolymers, and the like.<br>
Such materials comprise cellulose esters, cellulose ethers and cellulose ester-<br>
ethers. The cellulosic polymers have a degree of substitution (DS) of their<br>
anhydroglucose unit of from greater than 0 up to 3, inclusive. Degree of<br>
substitution (DS) means the average number of hydroxyl groups originally<br>
present on the anhydroglucose unit that are replaced by a substituting group or<br>
converted into another group. The anhydroglucose unit can be partially or<br>
completely substituted with groups such as acyl, alkanoyl, alkenoyl, aroyl, alkyl,<br>
alkoxy, halogen, carboalkyl, alkylcarbamate, alkylcarbonate, alkylsulfonate,<br>
alkysulfamate, semipermeable polymer forming groups, and the like, wherein<br>
the organic moieties contain from one to twelve carbon atoms, and preferably<br>
from one to eight carbon atoms.<br>
[000103] The semipermeable compositions typically include a member<br>
selected from the group consisting of cellulose acylate, cellulose diacylate,<br>
cellulose triacylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate,<br>

di-, and tri-aroylates, and the like. Exemplary polymers include cellulose<br>
acetate having a DS of 1.8 to 2.3 and an acetyl content of 32 to 39.9%;<br>
cellulose diacetate having a DS of 1 to 2 and an acetyl content of 21 to 35%;<br>
cellulose triacetate having a OS of 2 to 3 and an acetyl content of 34 to 44.8%;<br>
and the like. More specific cellulosic polymers include cellulose propionate<br>
having a DS of 1.8 and a propionyl content of 38.5%; cellulose acetate<br>
propionate having an acetyl content of 1.5 to 7% and an acetyl content of 39 to<br>
42%; cellulose acetate propionate having an acetyl content of 2.5 to 3%, an<br>
average propionyl content of 39.2 to 45%, and a hydroxyl content of 2.8 to<br>
5.4%; cellulose acetate butyrate having a DS of 1.8, an acetyl content of 13 to<br>
15%, and a butyryl content of 34 to 39%; cellulose acetate butyrate having an<br>
acetyl content of 2 to 29%, a butyryl content of 17 to 53%, and a hydroxyl<br>
content of 0.5 to 4.7%; cellulose triacylates having a DS of 2.6 to 3, such as<br>
cellulose trivalerate, cellulose trilamate, cellulose tripalmitate, cellulose<br>
trioctanoate and cellulose tripropionate; cellulose diesters having a DS of 2.2 to<br>
2.6, such as cellulose disuccinate, cellulose dipalmitate, cellulose dioctanoate,<br>
cellulose dicaprylate, and the like; and mixed cellulose esters, such as<br>
cellulose acetate valerate, cellulose acetate succinate, cellulose propionate<br>
succinate, cellulose acetate octanoate, cellulose valerate palmitate, cellulose<br>
acetate heptanoate, and the like. Semipermeable polymers are known in U.S.<br>

[000105] Wall 20 may also comprise a flux-regulating agent. The flux<br>
regulating agent is a compound added to assist in regulating the fluid<br>
permeability or flux through wall 20. The flux-regulating agent can be a flux-<br>
enhancing agent or a flux-decreasing agent. The agent can be preselected to<br>
increase or decrease the liquid flux. Agents that produce a marked increase in<br>
permeability to fluid such as water are often essentially hydrophilic, while those<br>
that produce a marked decrease to fluids such as water are essentially<br>
hydrophobic. The amount of regulator in the wall when incorporated therein<br>
generally is from about 0.01% to 20% by weight or more. The flux regulator<br>
agents may include polyhydric alcohols, polyalkylene glycols, polyalkylenediols,<br>
polyesters of alkylene glycols, and the like. Typical flux enhancers include<br>
polyethylene glycol 300,400, 600,1500, 4000, 6000 and the like; low<br>
molecular weight glycols such as polypropylene glycol, polybutylene glycol and<br>
polyamylene glycol: the polyalkylenediols such as poly(1,3-propanediol),<br>
poly(1,4-butanediol), poly(1,6-hexanediol), and the like; aliphatic diols such as<br>
1,3-butylene glycol, 1,4-pentamethylene glycol, 1,4-hexamethylene glycol, and<br>
the like; alkylene triols such as glycerine, 1,2,3-butanetriol, 1,2,4-hexanetriol,<br>
1,3,6-hexanetriol and the like; esters such as ethylene glycol dipropionate,<br>
ethylene glycol butyrate, butylene glycol dipropionate, glycerol acetate esters,<br>
and the like. Presently preferred flux enhancers include the group of<br>
difunctional block-copolymer polyoxyalkylene derivatives of propylene glycol<br>
known as pluronics (BASF). Representative flux-decreasing agents include<br>
phthalates substituted with an alkyl or alkoxy or with both an alkyl and alkoxy<br>
group such as diethylphthalate, dimethoxyethyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate,<br>
and [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate], aryl phthalates such as triphenyl phthalate,<br>
and butyl benzyl phthalate; insoluble salts such as calcium sulfate, barium<br>
sulfate, calcium phosphate, and the like; insoluble oxides such as titanium<br>
oxide; polymers in powder, granule and like form such as polystyrene,<br>
polymethylmethacrylate, polycarbonate, and polysulfone; esters such as citric<br>
acid esters esterified with long chain alkyl groups; inert and substantially water<br>
impermeable fillers; resins compatible with cellulose based wall forming<br>
materials, and the like.<br>
[000106] Other materials may be included in the semipermeable wall<br>
composition for imparting flexibility and elongation properties, for making wall<br>
20 less brittle and to render tear strength. Suitable materials include phthalate<br>
plasticizers such as dibenzyl phthalate, dihexyl phthalate, butyl octyl phthalate,<br>
straight chain phthalates of six to eleven carbons, di-isononyl phthalte, di-<br>
isodecyl phthalate, and the like. The plasticizers include nonphthalates such<br>
as triacetin, dioctyl azelate, epoxidized tallate, tri-isoctyl trimellitate, tri-isononyl<br>
trimellitate, sucrose acetate isobutyrate, epoxidized soybean oil, and the like.<br>
The amount of plasticizer in a wall when incorporated therein is about 0.01% to<br>
20% weight, or higher.<br>
[000107] Push layer 50, the third component, comprises an expandable<br>
composition in contacting layered arrangement with the second component<br>
drug layer 40 as illustrated in Figure 1 or in contacting layered arrangement<br>
with barrier layer 55 as illustrated in Figure 3. Push layer 50 comprises a<br>
polymer that imbibes an aqueous or biological fluid and swells to push the drug<br>
composition through the exit means of the device. A polymer having suitable<br>
imbibition properties may be referred to herein as an osmopolymer. The<br>
osmopolymers are swellable, hydrophilic polymers that interact with water and<br>
aqueous biological fluids and swell or expand to a high degree, typically<br>
exhibiting a 2-50 fold volume increase. The osmopolymer can be non-<br>
crosslinked or crosslinked, but in a preferred embodiment are at least lightly<br>
crosslinked to create a polymer network that is too large and entangled to exit<br>
the dosage form. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the expandable<br>
composition is retained within the dosage form during its operative lifetime.<br>
[000108] Representatives of fluid-imbibing displacement polymers<br>
comprise members selected from poly(alkylene oxide) of 1 million to 15 million<br>
number-average molecular weight, as represented by poly(ethylene oxide), and<br>
poly(alkali carboxymethylcellulose) of 500,000 to 3,500,000 number-average<br>
molecular weight, wherein the alkali is sodium, potassium or lithium. Examples<br>
of additional polymers for the formulation of the push layer composition<br>
comprise osmopolymers that form hydrogels, such as Carbopol® acidic<br>
carboxypolymer, a polymer of acrylic cross-linked with a polyallyl sucrose, also<br>
known as carboxypolymethylene, and carboxyvinyl polymer having a molecular<br>
weight of 250,000 to 4,000,000; Cyanamer® polyacrylamides; cross-linked<br>
water swellable indenemaleic anhydride polymers; Good-rite® polyacrylic acid<br>
having a molecular weight of 80,000 to 200,000; Aqua-Keeps® acrylate<br>
polymer polysaccharides composed of condensed glucose units, such as<br>
diester cross-linked polygluran; and the like. Representative polymers that<br>
form hydrogels are known to the prior art in U.S. Patent No. 3,865,108, issued<br>
to Hartop; U.S. Patent No. 4,002,173, issued to Manning; U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,207,893, issued to Michaels; and in Handbook of Common Polymers, Scott<br>
and Roff, Chemical Rubber Co., Cleveland, OH.<br>
[000109] Suitable osmagents, also known as osmotic solutes and<br>
osmotically effective agents, that may be found in the drug layer, delay layer<br>
and the push layer in the dosage form are those which exhibit an osmotic<br>
activity gradient across the wall 20. Suitable osmagents comprise a member<br>
selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
lithium chloride, magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, potassium sulfate,<br>
sodium sulfate, lithium sulfate, potassium acid phosphate, mannitol, urea,<br>
inositol, magnesium succinate, tartaric acid, raffinose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
lactose, sorbitol, inorganic salts, organic salts and carbohydrates.<br>
[000110] Exemplary solvents suitable for manufacturing the dosage form<br>
components comprise aqueous or inert organic solvents that do not adversely<br>
harm the materials used in the system. The solvents broadly include members<br>
selected from the group consisting of aqueous solvents, alcohols, ketones,<br>
esters, ethers, aliphatic hydrocarbons, halogenated solvents, cycloaliphatics,<br>
aromatics, heterocyclic solvents and mixtures thereof. Typical solvents include<br>
acetone, diacetone alcohol, methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol,<br>
methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, n-hexane, n-heptane, ethylene glycol<br>
monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl acetate, methylene dichloride,<br>
ethylene dichloride, propylene dichloride, carbon tetrachloride nitroethane,<br>
nitropropane tetrachloroethane, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, cyclohexane,<br>
cyclooctane, benzene, toluene, naphtha, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diglyme,<br>
water, aqueous solvents containing inorganic salts such as sodium chloride,<br>
calcium chloride, and the like, and mixtures thereof such as acetone and water,<br>
acetone and methanol, acetone and ethyl alcohol, methylene dichloride and<br>
methanol, and ethylene dichloride and methanol.<br>
[000111] Figure 3 illustrates a trilayered-compressed core including an<br>
optional third component barrier layer 55 separating drug layer 40 from push<br>
layer 50. Figure 3 also illustrates dosage form 10 including inner wall 90.<br>
[000112] The composition of barrier layer 55 is inert with the respect to the<br>
composition of the drug layer 40 and substantially impermeable; such that drug<br>
from drug layer 40 and the components of push layer 50 are prevented from<br>
mixing. Suitable materials include water-insoluble polymers, fats, fatty acids<br>
and fatty acid esters that are solids at ambient and body temperatures, and<br>
waxes. Representative water-insoluble polymers include ethyl cellulose,<br>
cellulose acetate, polyvinylchloride, copolymers of polyethylene and vinyl<br>
acetate, poly(methylmethacrylate), acrylic polymers such as Eudragit® L or<br>
Eudragit® R, poiycaprolactone, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid polymers (PLGA),<br>
high density polyethylene, rubber, styrene butadiene, polysilicone, nylon,,<br>
polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and halogenated polymers.<br>
Representative waxes include paraffin wax and beeswax. Representative fats,<br>
fatty acids and fatty acid esters include C16 - C24 long chain fatty acids, esters<br>
of such long chain fatty acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid, and mixtures<br>
of the foregoing. Mixtures of the above-described materials may be utilized,<br>
e.g., a mixture of ethyl cellulose and stearic acid, which is presently preferred.<br>
[000113] Inner wall 90 is permeable to the passage of gastric fluid entering<br>
the compartment defined by wall 20 and provides a lubricating function that<br>
facilitates the movement of delay layer 30, drug layer 40 and push layer 50<br>
toward exit 60. Inner wall 90 may be formed from hydrophilic materials and<br>
excipients. Outer wall 20 is semipermeable, allowing gastric fluid to enter the<br>
compartment, but preventing the passage of the materials comprising the core<br>
in the compartment. The deliverable cyclobenzaprine formulation is released<br>
from exit 60 as described above with respect to the embodiment of Figure 3.<br>
[000114] Inner wall 90 is located between at least the drug layer and the<br>
semipermeable wall to reduce friction between the external surface of delay<br>
layer 30 and drug layer 40, and the inner surface of wall 20. Inner wall 90<br>
promotes release of the drug composition from the compartment and reduces<br>
the amount of residual drug composition remaining in the compartment at the<br>
end of the delivery period, particularly when the slurry, suspension or solution<br>
of the drug composition that is being dispensed is highly viscous during the<br>
period of time in which it is being dispensed. In dosage forms in which there is<br>
high drug loading, i.e., 40% or greater active agent in the drug layer based on<br>
the overall weight of the drug layer, and no inner wall, it has been observed<br>
that significant residual amounts of drug may remain in the device after the<br>
period of delivery has been completed. In some instances, amounts of 20% or<br>
greater may remain in the dosage form at the end of a twenty-four hour period<br>
when tested in a release rate assay.<br>
[000115] Inner wall 90 is formed as an inner coat of a flow-promoting<br>
agent, i.e., an agent that lowers the frictional force between the outer wall 20<br>
and the external surface of drug layer 40. Inner wall 90 apparently reduces<br>
the frictional forces between outer wall 20 and the outer surface of drug layer<br>
40, and delay layer 30, thus allowing for more complete delivery of drug from<br>
the device. Particularly in the case of active compounds having a high cost,<br>
such an improvement presents substantial economic advantages since it is not<br>
necessary to load the drug layer with an excess of drug to insure that the<br>
minimal amount of drug required will be delivered. Inner wall 90 may be<br>
formed as a coating applied over the compressed core.<br>
[000116] Inner wall 90 typically may be 0.01 to 5 mm thick, more typically<br>
0.5 to 5mm thick, and it comprises a member selected from hydrogels, gelatin,<br>
low molecular weight polyethylene oxides, e.g., less than 100,000 MW,<br>
hydroxyalkylcelluloses, e.g., hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyisopropylcelluose, hydroxybutylcellulose and hydroxyphenylcellulose,<br>
and hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, e.g., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The hydroxyalkylcelluloses comprise polymers having a<br>
9,500 to 1,250,000 number-average molecular weight. For example,<br>
hydroxypropyl celluloses having number average molecular weights of between<br>
80,000 to 850,000 are useful. The inner wall may be prepared from<br>
conventional solutions or suspensions of the aforementioned materials in<br>
aqueous solvents or inert organic solvents. Prefered materials for the inner<br>
wall include hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl<br>
methyl cellulose, povidone [poly(vinylpyrrolidone)], polyethylene glycol, and<br>
mixtures thereof. More prefered are mixtures of hydroxypropyl cellulose and<br>
povidone, prepared in organic solvents, particularly organic polar solvents such<br>
as lower alkanols having 1-8 carbon atoms, preferably ethanol, mixtures of<br>
hydroxyethyl cellolose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose prepared in aqueous<br>
solution, and mixtures of hydroxyethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol<br>
prepared in aqueous solution. Most preferably, the inner wall comprises a<br>
mixture of hydroxypropyl cellulose and providone prepared in ethanol.<br>
Conveniently, the weight of the inner wall applied to the compressed core may<br>
be correlated with the thickness of the inner wall and residual drug remaining in<br>
a dosage form in a release rate assay such as described herein. As such,<br>
during manufacturing operations, the thickness of the inner wall may be<br>
controlled by controlling the weight of the inner wall taken up in the coating<br>
operation.<br>
[000117] When inner wall 90 is formed as a subcoat, i.e., by coating onto<br>
the tabletted composite including one or all of the drug layer, delay layer and<br>
push layer, the inner wall can fill in surface irregularities formed on the core by<br>
the tabletting process. The resulting smooth external surface facilitates<br>
slippage between the coated composite core and the semipermeabie wall<br>
during dispensing of the drug, resulting in a lower amount of residual drug<br>
composition remaining in the device at the end of the dosing period. When<br>
inner wall 90 is fabricated of a gel-forming material, contact with water in the<br>
environment of use facilitates formation of the gel or gel-like inner coat having<br>
a viscosity that may promote and enhance slippage between outer wall 20 and<br>
drug layer 40.<br>
[000118] Pan coating may be conveniently used to provide the completed<br>
dosage form, except for the exit orifice. In the pan coating system, the wall-<br>
forming composition for the inner wall or the outer wall, as the case may be, is<br>
deposited by successive spraying of the appropriate wall composition onto the<br>
compressed single, bilayered or trilayered core comprising the drug layer for<br>
the single layer core; the drug layer and the push layer for the bilayered core;<br>
or the drug layer, barrier layer and push layer for the trilayered core,<br>
accompanied by tumbling in a rotating pan. A pan coater is used because of<br>
its availability at commercial scale. Other techniques can be used for coating<br>
the compressed core. Once coated, the wall is dried in a forced-air oven or in<br>
a temperature and humidity controlled oven to free the dosage form of<br>
solvent(s) used in the manufacturing. Drying conditions will be conventionally<br>
chosen on the basis of available equipment, ambient conditions, solvents,<br>
coatings, coating thickness, and the like.<br>
[000119] Other coating techniques can also be employed. For example,<br>
the wall or walls of the dosage form may be formed in one technique using the<br>
air-suspension procedure. This procedure consists of suspending and<br>
tumbling the compressed single, bilayer or trilayer core in a current of air and<br>
the semipermeabie wall forming composition, until the wail is applied to the<br>
core. The air-suspension procedure is well suited for independently forming<br>
the wall of the dosage form. The air-suspension procedure is described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 2,799,241; in J. Am. Pharm. Assoc. Vol. 48, pp. 451-59 (1959);<br>
and, ibid., Vol. 49, pp. 82-84 (1960). The dosage form also can be coated with<br>
a Wurster® air-suspension coater using, for example, methylene dichloride<br>
methanol as a cosolvent for the wall forming material. An Aeromatic® air-<br>
suspension coater can be used employing a cosolvent.<br>
[000120] Dosage forms in accord with the present invention are<br>
manufactured by standard techniques. For example, the dosage form may be<br>
manufactured by the wet granulation technique. In the wet granulation<br>
technique, the drug and carrier are blended using an organic solvent, such as<br>
denatured anhydrous ethanol, as the granulation fluid. The remaining<br>
ingredients can be dissolved in a portion of the granulation fluid, such as the<br>
solvent described above, and this latter prepared wet blend is slowly added to<br>
the drug blend with continual mixing in the blender. The granulating fluid is<br>
added until a wet blend is produced, which wet mass blend is then forced<br>
through a predetermined screen onto oven trays. The blend is dried for 18 to<br>
24 hours at 24°C to 35°C in a forced-air oven. The dried granules are then<br>
sized. Next, magnesium stearate, or another suitable lubricant, is added to the<br>
drug granulation, and the granulation is put into milling jars and mixed on a jar<br>
mill for 10 minutes. The composition is pressed into a layer, for example, in a<br>
Manesty® press or a Korsch LCT press. For a bilayered core, the drug-<br>
containing layer is pressed and a similarly prepared wet blend of the push layer<br>
composition, if included, is pressed against the drug-containing layer. In the<br>
case of formation of the trilayered core, granules or powders of the drug layer<br>
composition, delay layer composition and push layer composition are<br>
sequentially placed in an appropriately-sized die with intermediate compression<br>
steps being applied to each of the first two layers, followed by a final<br>
compression step after the last layer is added to the die to form the trilayered<br>
core. The intermediate compression typically takes place under a force of<br>
about 50-100 newtons. Final stage compression typically takes place at a<br>
force of 3500 newtons or greater, often 3500-5000 newtons. The single,<br>
bilayer or trilayer compressed cores are fed to a dry coater press, e.g., Kilian®<br>
Dry Coater press, and subsequently coated with the wall materials as<br>
described above.<br>
[000121] One or more exit orifices are drilled in the drug layer end of the<br>
dosage form, and optional water soluble overcoats, which may be colored<br>
(e.g., Opadry colored coatings) or clear (e.g., Opadry Clear), may be coated on<br>
the dosage form to provide the finished dosage form.<br>
[000122] In another manufacture the drug and other ingredients comprising<br>
the drug layer are blended and pressed into a solid layer. The layer possesses<br>
dimensions that correspond to the internal dimensions of the area the layer is<br>
to occupy in the dosage form, and it also possesses dimensions corresponding<br>
to the push layer, if included, for forming a contacting arrangement therewith.<br>
The drug and other ingredients can also be blended with a solvent and mixed<br>
into a solid or semisolid form by conventional methods, such as ballmilling,<br>
calendering, stirring or rollmilling, and then pressed into a preselected shape.<br>
Next, if included, a layer of osmopolymer composition is placed in contact with<br>
the layer of drug in a like manner. The layering of the drug formulation and the<br>
osmopolymer layer can be fabricated by conventional two-layer press<br>
techniques. An analogous procedure may be followed for the preparation of<br>
the trilayered core in which the delay layer is present. The compressed cores<br>
then may be coated with the inner wail material and the semipermeable wall<br>
material as described above.<br>
[000123] Another manufacturing process that can be used comprises<br>
blending the powdered ingredients for each layer in a fluid bed granulator.<br>
After the powdered ingredients are dry blended in the granulator, a granulating<br>
fluid, for example, poly(vinylpyrrolidone) in water, is sprayed onto the powders.<br>
The coated powders are then dried in the granulator. This process granulates<br>
all the ingredients present therein while adding the granulating'flu id. After the<br>
granules are dried, a lubricant, such as stearic acid or magnesium stearate, is<br>
mixed into the granulation using a blender e.g., V-blender or tote blender. The<br>
granules are then pressed in the manner described above.<br>
[000124] The dosage form of the invention is provided with at least one exit<br>
60. Exit 60 cooperates with the compressed core for the uniform release of<br>
drug from the dosage form. The exit can be provided during the manufacture<br>
of the dosage form or during drug delivery by the dosage form in a fluid<br>
environment of use.<br>
[000125] Exit 60 may include an orifice that is formed or formable from a<br>
substance or polymer that erodes, dissolves or is leached from the outer wall to<br>
thereby form an exit orifice. The substance or polymer may include, for<br>
example, an erodible poly(glycolic) acid or poly(lactic) acid in the<br>
semipermeable wall; a gelatinous filament; a water-removable poly(vinyl<br>
alcohol); a teachable compound, such as a fluid removable pore-former<br>
selected from the group consisting of inorganic and organic salt, oxide and<br>
carbohydrate.<br>
[000126] An exit, or a plurality of exits, can be formed by leaching a<br>
member selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, lactose, fructose,<br>
glucose, mannose, galactose, talose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
sodium citrate and mannitol to provide a uniform-release dimensioned pore-exit<br>
orifice.<br>
[000127] The exit can have any shape, such as round, triangular, square,<br>
elliptical and the like for the uniform metered dose release of a drug from the<br>
dosage form.<br>
[000128] The dosage form can be constructed with one or more exits in<br>
spaced-apart relation or one or more surfaces of the dosage form.<br>
[000129] Drilling, including mechanical and laser drilling, through the<br>
semipermeable wall can be used to form the exit orifice. Such exits and<br>
equipment for forming such exits are disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 3,916,899,<br>
by Theeuwes and Higuchi and in U.S. Patent No. 4,088,864, by Theeuwes, et<br>
al. It is presently preferred to utilize two exits of equal diameter.<br>
[000130] Dosage forms of this invention exhibit sustained release of drug<br>
over a continuous time period that includes a prolonged time when drug is<br>
released at an ascending release rate as determined in a standard release rate<br>
assay such as that described herein. When administered to a subject, the<br>
dosage forms of the invention provide substantially ascending blood plasma<br>
drug concentrations in the subject that are less variable over a prolonged<br>
period of time than those obtained with immediate release dosage forms.<br>
When the dosage forms of this invention are administered on a continuous<br>
once-a-day basis, the dosage forms of the invention provide therapeutically<br>
effective ascending plasma cyclobenzaprine concentrations while providing<br>
steady-state peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentrations that occur at a later<br>
time following dose administration and that exhibit a lesser magnitude than the<br>
steady-state peak plasma cyclobenzaprine concentrations that occur following<br>
twice or three times a day administration of an immediate-release<br>
cyclobenzaprine dosage form.<br>
[000131] The practice of the foregoing methods of orally administering a<br>
cyclobenzaprine dosage form to a subject once a day is preferred. Other<br>
disease states and conditions, which may be manifested or diagnosed as<br>
muscle spasms, may be treated with the cyclobenzaprine dosage forms and<br>
methods of the invention. In addition, other disease states and conditions<br>
which may or may not manifest in association with depression but which may<br>
be responsive to treatment with cyclobenzaprine may also be treated with the<br>
dosage forms and methods of the invention.<br>
[000132] Preferred methods of manufacturing dosage forms of the present<br>
invention are generally described below. All percentages are weight percent<br>

[000133] Formulation was modified prior to compression on the Korsch<br>
Multilayer press using 7/32" LCT, Deep Concave tooling. The individual layers<br>
were reduced to 168 mg (Push layer), 93 mg (Drug layer) and 56 mg (Delay<br>
layer).<br>
[000134] Prior to wet granulation, the salt (NaCI) and ferric oxide were sieved<br>
using a 20-mesh screen (by hand, except for the push granulation where the<br>
milling was performed in the Quadra Comil equipped with a 21 mesh screen).<br>
For all the granulations, 50% of the povidone was sprayed as an aqueous<br>
solution (13% wt/wt) and the remaining 50% was charged as a powder to the<br>
batch. The drug layer was granulated using 10% excess drug to compensate<br>
for losses during the granulation process. Subsequent to the granulation, the<br>
dried mass was passed through a #7 mesh screen in the Granumill. The milled<br>
mass was then blended with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) for 10 min and<br>
stearic acid for 3 min in the GEMCO blender.<br>
[000135] Compression was performed on the Multilayer Korsch press. The<br>
trilayer cores were membrane coated in the 24" Hi-Coater. Upon coating,<br>
cores were drilled to an orifice diameter of 45 mil using the LCT Laser. Each<br>
orifice was centered on the delay layer dome. Finally, drilled systems were<br>
dried at 45°C/ 45% relative humidity in a Hotpack™ oven for 84 hour followed<br>
by 3 hour of drying at 45°C/ambient humidity to reduce residual acetone levels<br>
from coating. Dried systems were subsequently drug, color and clear coated in<br>
the 24" Aqueous Coater.<br>
[000136] This formulation for a dosage form with an immediate release<br>
overcoat resulted in the release rate profiles and cumulative release rate<br>
profiles as depicted in Figure 10 and Figure 11.<br>
[000137] As outlined in both Example 1 and Example 2 above, both the<br>
hydrated delay layer and the hydrated drug layer have a viscosity that is<br>
substantially similar. This is accomplished using the same or similar material in<br>
both the delay layer and the drug layer. And, this is preferably accomplished<br>
using the same or similar percentage of this material in both the delay layer<br>
and the drug layer. By these examples, the same grade of a material, i.e.<br>
Polyox® WSR N-150 is used and a substantially similar percentage of Polyox®<br>
WSR N-150 is utilized in both the delay layer and the drug layer. For example,<br>
84.35% Polyox® WSR N-150 in the delay layer versus 79.45% Polyox® WSR<br>
N-150 in the drug layer. For purposes of the present invention, this is a minimal<br>
differential in viscosity between the delay layer and the drug layer.<br>
[000138] Additionally, in this embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention, it is also acceptable to use different materials, different grades of<br>
material or even different percentages of a material in both the delay layer and<br>
the drug layer so long as there is a minimal difference in the respective<br>
viscosities of the delay layer and the drug layer.<br>
[000139] In an alternative embodiment in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the dosage form is designed with a notable, distinctive or substantial<br>
difference between the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer and the viscosity of<br>
the drug layer where the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer is less than the<br>
viscosity of the drug layer. This is accomplished by using different materials,<br>
different grades of material or even different percentages of a material in both<br>
the delay layer and the drug layer so long as there is a resulting notable,<br>
distinctive or substantial difference in the respective viscosities of the delay<br>
layer and the drug layer.<br>
[000140] In another embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the<br>
dosage form is designed with a notable, distinctive or substantial difference<br>
between the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer and the viscosity of the drug<br>
layer where the viscosity of the hydrated delay layer is higher than the viscosity<br>
of the drug layer. This is accomplished by using different materials, different<br>
grades of material or even different percentages of a material in both the delay<br>
layer and the drug layer so long as there is a resulting notable, distinctive or<br>
substantial difference in the respective viscosities of the delay layer and the<br>
drug layer.<br>
[000141] Accordingly, in accordance with the present invention the relative<br>
viscosities of the delay layer and drug layer are either higher, lower or the<br>
same or substantially similar.<br>
