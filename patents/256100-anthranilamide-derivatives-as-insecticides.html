variant a). If the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, bases which are employed in excess, such as triethylamine, pyridine, N-methylmorpholine or N,N-diethylaniline, may also act as solvents or diluents.<br>
A compound I can be converted in a manner known per se into another compound I by replacing one or more substituents of the starting compound I in the customary manner by (an)other substituent(s) according to the invention.<br>
Depending on the choice of the reaction conditions and starting materials which are suitable in each case, it is possible, for example, in one reaction step only to replace one substituent by another substituent according to the invention, or a plurality of substituents can be replaced by other substituents according to the invention in the same reaction step.<br>
Salts of compounds I can be prepared in a manner known per se. Thus, for example, acid addition salts of compounds I are obtained by treatment with a suitable acid or a suitable ion exchanger reagent and salts with bases are obtained by treatment with a suitable base or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent.<br>
Salts of compounds I can be converted in the customary manner into the free compounds I, acid addition salts, for example, by treatment with a suitable basic compound or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent and salts with bases, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid or with a suitable ion exchanger reagent.<br>
Salts of compounds I can be converted in a manner known per se into other salts of compounds I, acid addition salts, for example, into other acid addition salts, for example by treatment of a salt of inorganic acid such as hydrochloride with a suitable metal salt such as a sodium, barium or silver salt, of an acid, for example with silver acetate, in a suitable solvent in which an inorganic salt which forms, for example silver chloride, is insoluble and thus precipitates from the reaction mixture.<br>
Depending on the procedure or the reaction conditions, the compounds I, which have salt-forming properties can be obtained in free form or in the form of salts.<br>
The compounds I and, where appropriate, the tautomers thereof, in each case in free form or in salt form, can be present in the form of one of the isomers which are possible or as a mixture of these, for example in the form of pure isomers, such as antipodes and/or diastereomers, or as isomer mixtures, such as enantiomer mixtures, for example racemates, diastereomer mixtures or racemate mixtures, depending on the number, absolute and relative configuration of asymmetric carbon atoms which occur in the molecule and/or depending on the configuration of non-aromatic double bonds which occur in the molecule; the invention relates to the pure isomers and also to all isomer mixtures which are possible and is to be understood in each case in this sense hereinabove and hereinbelow, even when stereochemical details are not mentioned specifically in each case.<br>
Diastereomer mixtures or racemate mixtures of compounds I, in free form or in salt form, which can be obtained depending on which starting materials and procedures have been chosen can be separated in a known manner into the pure diasteromers or racemates on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the components, for example by fractional crystallization, distillation and/or chromatography.<br>
Enantiomer mixtures, such as racemates, which can be obtained in a similar manner can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, for example by recrystallization from an optically active solvent, by chromatography on chiral adsorbents, for example high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on acetyl celulose, with the aid of suitable microorganisms, by cleavage with specific, immobilized enzymes, via the formation of inclusion compounds, for example using chiral crown ethers, where only one enantiomer is com-plexed, or by conversion into diastereomeric salts, for example by reacting a basic end-product racemate with an optically active acid, such as a carboxylic acid, for example camphor, tartaric or malic acid, or sulfonic acid, for example camphorsulfonic acid, and separating the diastereomer mixture which can be obtained in this manner, for example by fractional crystallization based on their differing solubilities, to give the diastereomers, from which the desired enantiomer can be set free by the action of suitable agents, for example basic agents.<br>
Pure diastereomers or enantiomers can be obtained according to the invention not only by separating suitable isomer mixtures, but also by generally known methods of diastereose-lective or enantioselective synthesis, for example by carrying out the process according to the invention with starting materials of a suitable stereochemistry.<br>
It is advantageous to isolate or synthesize in each case the biologically more effective iso-mer, for example enantiomer or diastereomer, or isomer mixture, for example enantiomer mixture or diastereomer mixture, if the individual components have a different biological activity.<br>
The compounds I and, where appropriate, the tautomers thereof, in each case in free form or in salt form, can, if appropriate, also be obtained in the form of hydrates and/or include other solvents, for example those which may have been used for the crystallization of compounds which are present in solid form.<br>
The compounds I according to the invention are preventively and/or curatively valuable active ingredients in the field of pest control, even at low rates of application, which have a very favorable biocidal spectrum and are well tolerated by warm-blooded species, fish and plants. The active ingredients according to the invention act against all or individual developmental stages of normally sensitive, but also resistant, animal pests, such as insects or representatives of the order Acarina. The insecticidal or acaricidal activity of the active ingredients according to the*invention can manifest itself directly, i. e. in destruction of the pests, which takes place either immediately or only after some time has elapsed, for example during ecdysis, or indirectly, for example in a reduced opposition and/or hatching rate, a good activity corresponding to a destruction rate (mortality) of at least 50 to 60%.<br>

The active ingredients according to the invention can be used for controlling, i. e. containing or destroying, pests of the abovementioned type which occur in particular on plants, especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forests, or on organs, such as fruits, flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers or roots, of such plants, and in some cases even plant organs which are formed at a later point in time remain protected against these pests.<br>
Suitable target crops are, in particular, cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize or sorghum; beet, such as sugar or fodder beet; fruit, for example pomaceous fruit, stone fruit or soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries or berries, for example strawberries, raspberries or blackberries; leguminous crops, such as beans, lentils, peas or soya; oil crops, such as oilseed rape, mustard, poppies, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor, cocoa or ground nuts; cucurbits, such as pumpkins, cucumbers or melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit or tangerines; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes or bell peppers; Lauraceae, such as avocado, Cinnamonium or camphor; and also tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplants, sugarcane, tea, pepper, grapevines, hops, the plantain family, latex plants and ornamentals.<br>
The active ingredients according to the invention are especially suitable for controlling Aphis craccivora, Diabrotica balteata, Heliothis virescens, Myzus persicae, Plutella xylostella and Spodoptera littoralis in cotton, vegetable, maize, rice and soya crops. The active ingredients according to the invention are further especially suitable for controlling Mamestra (preferably in vegetables), Cydia pomonella (preferably in apples), Empoasca(preferably in vegetables, vineyards), Leptinotarsa (preferably in potatos) and Chilo supressalis (preferably in rice).<br>
The term "crops" is to be understood as including also crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides like bromoxynil or classes of herbicides (such as, for example, HPPD inhibitors, ALS inhibitors, for example primisulfuron, prosulfuron and trifloxysulfuron, EPSPS (5-enol-pyrovyl-shikimate-3-phosphate-synthase) inhibitors, GS (glutamine synthetase) inhibitors) as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. An example of a crop that has been rendered tolerant to imidazolinones, e.g. imazamox, by conventional methods of breeding (mutagenesis) is Clearfield® summer rape (Canola). Examples of crops that have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by genetic engineering methods include glyphosate- and glufosinate-resistant maize varieties commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady®, Herculex I® and Liberty Link®.<br>
The term "crops" is to be understood as including also crop plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that they are capable of<br>
synthesising one or more selectively acting toxins, such as are known, for example, from toxin-producing bacteria, especially those of the genus Bacillus.<br>
Toxins that can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for example, insecticidal proteins, for example insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus or Bacillus popliae; or insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as 5-endotoxins, e.g. CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), CryllA(b), CrylllA, CrylllB(bl) or Cry9c, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), e.g. VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A; or insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonising nematodes, for example Photorhabdus spp. or Xenorhabdus spp., such as Photorhabdus luminescens, Xenorhabdus nematophilus; toxins produced by animals, such as scorpion toxins, arachnid toxins, wasp toxins and other insect-specific neurotoxins; toxins produced by fungi, such as Streptomycetes toxins, plant lectins, such as pea lectins, barley lectins or snowdrop lectins; agglutinins; proteinase inhibitors, such as trypsine inhibitors, serine protease inhibitors, patatin, cystatin, papain inhibitors; ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIP), such as ricin, maize-RIP, abrin, luffin, saporin or bryodin; steroid metabolism enzymes, such as 3-hydroxysteroidoxidase, ecdysteroid-UDP-glycosyl-transferase, cholesterol oxidases, ecdysone inhibitors, HMG-COA-reductase, ion channel blockers, such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels, juvenile hormone esterase, diuretic hormone receptors, stilbene synthase, bibenzyl synthase, chitinases and glucanases.<br>
In the context of the present invention there are to be understood by 8-endotoxins, for example CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CrylF, CrylF(a2), Cry)IA(b), CrylllA, CryllIB(b1) or Cry9c, or vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIP), for example VIP1, VIP2, VIP3 or VIP3A, expressly also hybrid toxins, truncated toxins and modified toxins. Hybrid toxins are produced recombinantly by a new combination of different domains of those proteins (see, for example, WO 02/15701). Truncated toxins, for example a truncated CrylA(b), are known. In the case of modified toxins, one or more amino acids of the naturally occurring toxin are replaced. In such amino acid replacements, preferably non-naturally present protease recognition sequences are inserted into the toxin, such as, for example, in the case of CrylllAO55, a cathepsin-D-recognition sequence is inserted into a CrylllA toxin (see WO 03/018810).<br>
Examples of such toxins or transgenic plants capable of synthesising such toxins are disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 374 753, WO 93/07278, WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 427 529, EP-A-451 878 and WO 03/052073.<br>
The processes for the preparation of such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above. Cryl-type deoxyribonucleic acids and their preparation are known, for example, from WO 95/34656, EP-A-0 367 474, EP-A-0 401 979 and WO 90/13651.<br>
The toxin contained in the transgenic plants imparts to the plants tolerance to harmful insects. Such insects can occur in any taxonomic group of insects, but are especially commonly found in the beetles (Coleoptera), two-winged insects (Diptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera).<br>
Transgenic plants containing one or more genes that code for an insecticidal resistance and express one or more toxins are known and some of them are commercially available. Examples of such plants are: YieldGard® (maize variety that expresses a CrylA(b) toxin); YieldGard Rootworm® (maize variety that expresses a CrylHB(bl) toxin); YieldGard Plus® (maize variety that expresses a CrylA(b) and a CrylllB(bl) toxin); Starlink® (maize variety that expresses a Cry9(c) toxin); Herculex I® (maize variety that expresses a CrylF(a2) toxin and the enzyme phosphinothricine N-acetyltransf erase (PAT) to achieve tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium); NuCOTN 33B® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) toxin); Bollgard I® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) toxin); Bollgard II® (cotton variety that expresses a CrylA(c) and a CryllA(b) toxin); VIPCOT® (cotton variety that expresses a VIP toxin); NewLeaf® (potato variety that expresses a CrylllA toxin); Nature-Gard® Agrisure® GT Advantage (GA21 glyphosate-tolerant trait), Agrisure® CB Advantage (Bt11 corn borer (CB) trait) and Protecta®.<br>

The term "crops" is to be understood as including also crop plants which have been so transformed by the use of recombinant DMA techniques that they are capable of synthesising antipathogenic substances having a selective action, such as, for example, the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs, see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225). Examples of such antipathogenic substances and transgenic plants capable of synthesising such antipathogenic substances are known, for example, from EP-A-0 392 225, WO 95/33818, and EP-A-0 353 191. The methods of producing such transgenic plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described, for example, in the publications mentioned above.<br>
Antipathogenic substances which can be expressed by such transgenic plants include, for example, ion channel blockers, such as blockers for sodium and calcium channels, for example the viral KP1, KP4 or KP6 toxins; stilbene synthases; bibenzyl synthases; chitinases; glucanases; the so-called "pathogenesis-related proteins" (PRPs; see e.g. EP-A-0 392 225); antipathogenic substances produced by microorganisms, for example peptide antibiotics or heterocyclic antibiotics (see e.g. WO 95/33818) or protein or polypeptide factors involved in plant pathogen defence (so-called "plant disease resistance genes", as described in WO 03/000906).<br>

The invention therefore also relates to pesticidal compositions such as emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, soluble powders, dispersible powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules or encapsulations in polymeric substances, which comprise - at least - one of the active ingredients according to the invention and which are to be selected to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
In these compositions, the active ingredient is employed in pure form, a solid active ingredient for example in a specific particle size, or, preferably, together with - at least - one of the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, such as extenders, for example solvents or solid carriers, or such as surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Examples of suitable solvents are: unhydrogenated or partially hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions C8 to C12 of alkylbenzenes, such as xylene mixtures, al-kylated naphthalenes or tetrahydronaphthalene, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as paraffins or cyclohexane, alcohols such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and their ethers and esters such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol or<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-me-thylpyrrolid-2-one, dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide, water, unepoxidized or epoxidized vegetable oils, such as unexpodized or epoxidized rapeseed, castor, coconut or soya oil, and silicone oils.<br>
Solid carriers which are used for example for dusts and dispersible powders are, as a rule, ground natural minerals such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. To improve the physical properties, it is also possible to add highly disperse silicas or highly disperse absorbtive polymers. Suitable particulate adsorptive carriers for granules are porous types, such as pumice, brick grit, sepiolite or bentonite, and suitable non-sorptive carrier materials are calcite or sand. In addition, a large number of granulated materials of inorganic or organic nature can be used, in particular dolomite or comminuted plant residues.<br>
Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the type of the active ingredient to be formulated, non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants or surfactant mixtures which have good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The surfactants mentioned below are only to be considered as examples; a large number of further surfactants which are conventionally used in the art of formulation and suitable according to the invention are described in the relevant literature.<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants are, especially, polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cyc-loaliphatic alcohols, of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids or of alkyl phenols which may contain approximately 3 to approximately 30 glycol ether groups and approximately 8 to approximately 20 carbon atoms in the (cyclo)aliphatic hydrocarbon radical or approximately 6 to approximately 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety of the alkyl phenols. Also suitable are water-soluble polyethylene oxide adducts with polypropylene glycol, ethylenediaminopo-lypropylene glycol or alkyl polypropylene glycol having 1 to approximately 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and approximately 20 to approximately 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and approximately 10 to approximately 100 propylene glycol ether groups. Normally, the abovementioned compounds contain 1 to approximately 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples which may be mentioned are nonylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol, castor oil polyglycol ether, polypropylene glycol/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylpheno-<br>
xypolyethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol or octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Also suitable are fatty acid esters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
The cationic surfactants are, especially, quarternary ammonium salts which generally have at least one alkyl radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms as substituents and as further substituents (unhalogenated or halogenated) lower alkyl or hydroxyalkyl or benzyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates. Examples are stearyltrimethylammonium chloride and benzylbis(2-chloroethyl)ethyl-ammonium bromide.<br>
Examples of suitable anionic surfactants are water-soluble soaps or water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Examples of suitable soaps are the alkali, alkaline earth or (un-substttuted or substituted) ammonium salts of fatty acids having approximately 10 to approximately 22 C atoms, such as the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which are obtainable for example from coconut or tall oil; mention must also be made of the fatty acid methyl taurates. However, synthetic surfactants are used more frequently, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylaryl sulfonates. As a rule, the fatty sulfonates and fatty sulfates are present as alkali, alkaline earth or (substituted or unsubstituted) ammonium salts and they generally have an alkyl radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms, alkyl also to be understood as including the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals; examples which may be mentioned are the sodium or calcium salts of lignosulfonic acid, of the dodecylsulfuric ester or of a fatty alcohol sulfate mixture prepared from natural fatty acids. This group also includes the salts of the sulfuric esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives preferably contain 2 suifonyl groups and a fatty acid radical of approximately 8 to approximately 22 C atoms. Examples of alkylarylsulfonates are the sodium, calcium or triethanolammonium salts of decylbenzenesulfonic acid, of dibutyl-naphthalenesulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde condensate. Also possible are, furthermore, suitable phosphates, such as salts of the phosphoric ester of a p-nonylphenol/(4-14)ethylene oxide adduct, or phospholipids.<br>
As a rule, the compositions comprise 0.1 to 99%, especially 0.1 to 95%, of active ingredient and 1 to 99.9%, especially 5 to 99.9%, of at least one solid or liquid adjuvant, it being possible as a rule for 0 to 25%, especially 0.1 to 20%, of the composition to be surfactants(% in each case meaning percent by weight). Whereas concentrated<br>
compositions tend to be preferred for commercial goods, the end consumer as a rule uses dilute compositions which have substantially lower concentrations of active ingredient. Preferred compositions are composed in particular as follows (% = percent by weight):<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates: active ingredient: surfactant: solvent:<br>
Dusts:<br>
active ingredient:<br>
solid carrier:<br>
Suspension concentrates: active ingredient: water: surfactant:<br>
Wettable powders:	*<br>
active ingredient: surfactant: solid carrier:<br>
Granulates: active ingredient: solid carrier:<br>
1 to 95%, preferably 5 to 20% 1 to 30%, preferably 10 to 20 % 5 to 98%, preferably 70 to 85%<br>
0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 1% 99.9 to 90%, preferably 99.9 to 99%<br>
5 to 75%, preferably 10 to 50% 94 to 24%, preferably 88 to 30% 1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%<br>
0.5 to 90%, preferably 1 to 80% 0.5 to 20%, preferably 1 to 15% 5 to 99%, preferably 15 to 98%<br>
0.5 to 30%, preferably 3 to 15% 99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br>
The compositions can also comprise further solid or liquid auxiliaries, such as stabilizers, for example unepoxidized or epoxidized vegetable oils (for example epoxidized coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soya oil), antifoams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or tackifiers, fertilizers or other active ingredients for achieving specific effects, for example bactericides, fungicides, nematocides, plant activators, molluscicides or herbicides.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are prepared in a manner known per se, in the absence of auxiliaries for example by grinding, screening and/or compressing a solid active<br>
ingredient and in the presence of at least one auxiliary for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient with the auxiliary (auxiliaries). These processes for the preparation of the compositions and the use of the compounds I for the preparation of these compositions are also a subject of the invention.<br>
The application methods for the compositions, that is the methods of controlling pests of the abovementioned type, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, brushing on, dressing, scattering or pouring - which are to be selected to suit the intended aims of the prevailing circumstances - and the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the abovementioned type are other subjects of the invention. Typical rates of concentration are between 0.1 and 1000 ppm, preferably between 0.1 and 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The rate of application per hectare is generally 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, in particular 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably 10 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the field of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), it being possible to select frequency and rate of application to match the danger of infestation with the pest in question. Alternatively, the active ingredient can reach the plants via the root system (systemic action), by drenching the locus of the plants with a liquid composition or by incorporating the active ingredient in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, for example in the form of granules (soil application). In the case of paddy rice crops, such granules can be metered into the flooded paddy-field.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are also suitable for the protection of plant propagation material, for example seeds, such as fruit, tubers or kernels, or nursery plants, against pests of the abovementioned type. The propagation material can be treated with the compositions prior to planting, for example seed can be treated prior to sowing. Alternatively, the compositions can be applied to seed kernels (coating), either by soaking the kernels in a liquid composition or by applying a layer of a solid composition. It is also possible to apply the compositions when the propagation material is planted to the site of application, for example into the seed furrow during drilling. These treatment methods for plant propagation material and the plant propagation material thus treated are further subjects of the invention.<br>
