The present invention relates especially to a composition for manufacturing an article comprising one or more superposed layers each less than 5 centimetres thick, comprising a hydraulic binder and at least one compound chosen from an organic compound comprising at least two hydrophilic functions and a hydrophobic chain, and a polyamide oligomer.<br>
The use of these additives in the presence of hydraulic binder allows the manufacture of articles and coatings with good protection against water uptake and cracking, satisfactory water resistance and good mechanical properties such as breaking strength.<br>
Hydraulic binders are generally cements based on calcium silicates and/or mineral aluminates or plasters based on calcium sulphate used in numerous industries, particularly in the construction field for making the infrastructure of buildings, works of art, apartment buildings or articles such as paving slabs or boards and tiles.<br>
Hydraulic binders may also be reinforced with fibres for the manufacture of fibrocements used, for example, as a material for making articles for covering roofs, pipework or tanks.<br>
Hydraulic binders are manufactured from natural materials, which are calcined at very high<br><br>
temperature and converted into mineral compounds capable of reacting with water to produce a binder, which, after curing, forms a compact mass with good mechanical properties.<br>
However, the articles obtained with the hydraulic binders known in the prior art react with water over time. The penetration of water causes efflorescences to the surface of the articles, resulting from carbonatation phenomena, and may possibly lead to a degradation in the mechanical properties. The penetration of water is generally accompanied by a low resistance of the structures to the freezing/thawing cycle.<br>
Similarly, during their drying, thin articles encounter problems of cracking, caused especially by evaporation of water.<br>
Such phenomena can affect the mechanical properties and the durability of the articles or works made with such a binder.<br>
As hydraulic binders presenting such drawbacks, mention may be made of: Portland cement, aluminous or high alumina cement, quick-setting cement and natural cements of Vicalpe and Rapide type.<br>
There is thus a need for a hydraulic binder that has good mechanical performance and low water absorption to overcome the drawbacks mentioned previously.<br><br>
It has been found that the use of additives such as an organic compound comprising at least two hydrophilic functions and a hydrophobic chain and/or a polyamide oligomer comprising a low number of repeating units in the presence of hydraulic binder allows the manufacture of articles and coatings with good protection against water uptake and satisfactory water resistance.<br>
The articles or coatings according to the invention obtained using a composition comprising a hydraulic binder and these additives also have good mechanical properties such as breaking strength and resistance to cracking.<br>
Very good results have especially been observed on articles comprising one or more superposed layers each less than 5 centimetres thick.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing an article comprising one or more superposed layers each less than 5 centimetres thick, obtained by using a composition comprising a hydraulic binder and at least one compound chosen from:<br>
an organic compound comprising at least two hydrophilic functions and a hydrophobic chain, and<br>
a polyamide oligomer comprising less than 20 repeating units, preferably less than 10 repeating units.<br>
Processes for manufacturing an article of<br><br>
cement or fibrocement type are widely known in the prior art. Mention may be made, for example, of the Hatscheck process for the manufacture of fibrocements, or any process known to those skilled in the art for the manufacture of cement materials (for example pouring, injection or spraying).<br>
Generally, the hydraulic binder is mixed with a composition comprising water and additives to form the articles. The composition may optionally be heated and/or blended before leaving it to set to a solid, for example in a mould.<br>
Depending on the articles that it is desired to obtain, a person skilled in the art is entirely capable of manufacturing them from a composition according to the invention comprising a hydraulic binder.<br>
According to the invention, additives such as the said organic compound, the polyamide oligomer or fibres, latex and a water-soluble amphiphilic copolymer may be added to the composition extemporaneously at the time of manufacture of the article. It is also possible for these compounds to be added to the dry hydraulic binder.<br>

These two monomers may be used in the oligomer in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric proportions, for example with an excess of one of the two monomers that may be up to 50%. The polyamide oligomers may bear a function chosen, for example, from phosphates, phosphonates, sulphonates, alkoxysilanes, dicarboxylates, aminocarboxylates, anhydrides, epoxys and diols.

With reference to the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig. 1 indicates the curve representing the stress tolerated as a function of the bending of the specimen (fibrocements with polyamide fibres and addition of polyamide oligomers).<br>

Example 1<br>
Cement cakes are prepared according to a process consisting in filtering a suspension of cement, fillers and additives in the presence of 0%, 0.5% or 1%<br><br>
of additives chosen from adipic acid alone, or a mixture of adipic acid and latex powder based on acetate-versatate copolymer (50/50 or 25/75, respectively).<br>
The composition used comprises 30% cement (sold by Lafarge under the reference HTS 52.5) diluted in water with a water/cement ratio = 3 (W/C).<br>
The slurry comprising the additives is filtered to obtain a cement cake. The cakes are left for 24 hours in an air-conditioned room at 25°C and with a relative humidity (RH) of 60% before testing. The cakes are approximately 1 centimetre thick.<br>
The results are given in Table 1.<br><br>
50% by weight of adipic acid and 50% by weight of PAV.<br>
Adipic + PAV 25/75 represents a mixture of 25% by weight of adipic acid and 75% by weight of PAV.<br>
These results show an improvement in the performance of the cement by adding additives such as adipic acid or adipic acid and acetate-versatate latex (PAV) powder.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
The cement objects obtained in Example 1 are subjected to two tests measuring the water uptake and the water absorption.<br>
The water absorption measurement is performed by exposing the additive-containing cement objects obtained in the above example, dried beforehand for one hour in an oven at 80°C and weighed, in a chamber with a relative humidity (RH) of 75% at 25°C for 2, 5 and 12 days.<br>
The water drop test consists in measuring the time required for the penetration of four drops of deionized water deposited, at room temperature and after the same drying process as previously, onto the surface of the cement object obtained in the example.<br>
The results are given in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
These results show that better water resistance is obtained with cement comprising additives such as adipic acid or adipic acid and acetate-versatate latex powder. Example 3<br>
The cement compositions below are prepared using a mixer:<br>
Composition	12        3<br>
Cement sold by Lafarge under<br>
the reference HTS 52.5	100      100      100<br>
Fumed silica sold by Elkem<br>
under the reference 940 U       10       10       10<br>
Adipic acid	0.4       2<br>
PAV22 latex	0.3      1.5<br>
Geropon T36	0.3      1.5<br>
Water	50       50       50<br>
A measurement of the density of these suspensions is then performed (by weighing 250 cm3 of this suspension) and it is found that the additive system according to the invention allows a lowering of this density. Density of the cement paste    1.92     1.64     1.42<br>
This suspension is then cast into 16x4x4 cm moulds, so as to prepare specimens on which several types of measurements will be performed. These specimens are left to age for 30 days at room<br><br>
temperature before performing these measurements, which are:<br>
•	the density of the specimens, to determine the<br>
"lightening" capacity of the additive system<br>
Composition	12        3<br>
Density of the cement article<br>
after setting and ageing for<br>
30 days	1.65     1.47     1.21<br>
•	their behaviour with respect to water (hydrophobicity<br>
or pearling effect) using the water drop test as<br>
described in Example 2, after drying the specimens<br>
under the same conditions as in Example 2. The test<br>
is performed both on the outer surface of the<br>
specimen and on the inner surface of the specimen<br>
after the said specimen has been broken (test<br>
performed at the break).<br>
Absorption Time<br>
Composition	12        3<br>
Outer surface of the specimen 3 min 15 min &gt;30 min<br>
Inner surface of the specimen 15 5 min &gt;30 min<br>

•	the 3-point bending mechanical strength properties,<br>

in Example 4:<br>
Composition	12        3<br>
Maximum stress (a max in kN)    0.3     0.35     0.51<br>
The compression properties of the specimens<br><br>
of compositions 2 and 3 are not prohibitively degraded compared with the specimen of composition 1, despite the lowering in density provided by these compositions 2 and 3 -Example 4<br>
Various composite materials of fibrocement type, 5 millimetres thick, were prepared as indicated below.<br>
The composition of the fibrocement used in the examples is as follows:<br>
cement sold by Lafarge under the<br>
reference HTS 52.5	200 g<br>
fumed silica sold by Elkem under the<br>
reference 940 U	35 g<br>
cellulose extracted from Pinus radiata	10 g<br>
polyamide reinforcing fibres	5 g<br>
additives	2 g<br>
water	750 g<br>
The cellulose is first pulped for one hour with vigorous stirring and the other ingredients are then added. After blending for 15 minutes, the mixture is poured into a mould and a primary gentle suction is applied. The resulting cake is then subjected to a pressure of 10 tons (10 MPa) in order to form the samples. For each formulation, 6 fibrocement specimens are manufactured: 120 x 30 x 5 mm in size.<br>
These specimens are left for 24 hours at room<br><br>
temperature in a chamber saturated with moisture, and are then matured for 24 hours at 60°C in a chamber that is again saturated with moisture, and finally left for at least 24 hours in an air-conditioned room at 20°C with a relative humidity (RH) of 65% before testing.<br>
The mechanical tests are performed in 3-point bending (inter-axis: 100 mm), at a test speed of 0.1 mm/min. This test is a standard 3-point bending test. The force-displacement curve is recorded and the equivalent stress corresponding to the maximum load (a max) is calculated. The equivalent stress corresponding to a 2 mm bend of the specimen is also calculated.<br>
In all cases, no sign of cracking is noted on the edges of the specimens, even during long-term ageing of the products.<br>
Table 3 shows the relative increase in the maximum stress obtained during the test of a fibrocement reinforced with additive, compared with the maximum stress obtained during the test of a fibrocement without additive. This relative increase is noted as Aa max.<br><br><br>
condensation of adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine with an acid stoichiometry of 20% relative to the equilibrium stoichiometry (1 mol of diacid per 1 mol of diamine) comprising about 8 to 14 units.<br>
The PA AISNa oligomer is a sodium salt of sulphonated polyamide oligomer obtained by polycondensation of 3 monomers (adipic acid, hexamethylenediamine and sulphonated isophthalic acid) comprising about 8 to 14 units.<br>
PAV22, of trade name Rhoximat® PAV22, is a latex powder based on acetate-versatate copolymer.<br>
The curves representing the stress tolerated as a function of the bending of the specimen)are given in Figure 1 (fibrocements with polyamide fibres and addition of polyamide oligomers) and in Figure 2 (fibrocements reinforced with polyamide fibres and addition of adipic and/or latex).<br>
In these figures, the x-axes correspond to the bending of the specimen in millimetres, and the y-axes correspond to the bending stress in MPa.<br><br>
The polyamide fibres used are the following:<br>
PA 0.6 dtex fibre: this is a polyamide 66 fibre of thin, round cross section, produced by Rhodia Technical Fibers for Flock application. It is a non-twist fibre chopped to 6 mm, the mechanical characteristics of which are especially an elongation at break of 80%.<br>

fibres (PA 0.6 dtex fibre) and of adipic acid. The maximum stress tolerable by the<br>
fibrocement is increased in the presence of additives.<br>
Furthermore, the ductility of the material may be<br>
substantially increased by adding an additive, which<br>
represents an appreciable improvement in the working<br>
properties.<br>
The results obtained in Figures 1 and 2 show<br>
the advantage of using fibres with a low yarn count to<br>
obtain a maximum gain both in the maximum stress<br>
tolerable by the material and in its ductility.<br>
Example 5<br>
Various composite materials of fibrocement<br>
type, 5 millimetres thick, were prepared as indicated<br>
below.<br>
The composition of the fibrocement used in<br>
the examples is as follows:<br>
cement sold by Lafarge under the<br>
reference HTS 52.5	200 g<br>
fumed silica sold by Elkem under the<br>
reference 940 U	35 g<br>
cellulose extracted from Pinus  radiata	10 g<br>
reinforcing fibres	5 g<br>
additives	2 g<br>
water	750 g<br><br>
The cellulose is first pulped for one hour with vigorous stirring and the other ingredients are then added. After blending for 15 minutes, the mixture is poured into a mould and a primary gentle suction is applied. The resulting cake is then subjected to a pressure of 10 tons (10 MPa) in order to form the samples. For each formulation, 6 fibrocement specimens are manufactured: 120 x 30 x 5 mm in size.<br>
These specimens are left for 24 hours at room temperature in a chamber saturated with moisture, and are then matured for 24 hours at 60°C in a chamber that is again saturated with moisture, and finally left for at least 24 hours in an air-conditioned room at 20°C with a relative humidity (RH) of 65% before testing.<br>
The mechanical tests are performed in 3-point bending (inter-axis: 100 mm), at a test speed of 0.1 mm/min. This test is a standard 3-point bending test. The force-displacement curve is recorded and the equivalent stress corresponding to the maximum load (a  max) is calculated. The equivalent stress corresponding to a 2 mm bend of the specimen is also calculated.<br>
In all cases, no sign of cracking is noted on the edges of the specimens, even during long-term ageing of the products.<br>
The following additive system was used (the percentages given are weight percentages):<br><br>
-	Latex PAV22      40%<br>
-	Adipic	40%<br>
-	Geropon T36      20%<br>
These additives are used at a content of 1% by weight relative to the cement.<br>
The fibres used are polyamide PA 6.6 fibres of 78fl36 type chopped to 6 mm, or APV RM 182® fibres sold by the company Kurarray, chopped to 6 mm.<br>
The maximum stress tolerable by the fibrocement in the presence of fibres (APV or PA) is maintained in the presence of additives.<br>
Furthermore, the density of the materials is substantially reduced.<br>
Finally, the hydrophobic power is markedly improved in the presence of the additives.<br><br><br><br><br>
