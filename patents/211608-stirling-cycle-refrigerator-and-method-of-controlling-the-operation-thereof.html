SPECIFICATION<br>
STIRLING CYCLE REFRIGERATOR AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING THE OPERATION THEREOF<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a Stirling cycle refrigerator, and particularly to a free-<br><br>
I present invention relates also to a method for controlling the operation of such a Stirling cycle<br>
Refrigerator.<br>
Background art<br>
A Stirling cycle refrigerator is a refrigerating system that is designed to offer the desired cooling performance by exploiting a thermodynamic cycle known as the reversed Stirling cycle.    In particular, free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerators that do not employ u<br>
  Relatively easy to design and offer excellent performance, and therefore their development has been quite active in these days with a view to putting them into practical use.<br>
Fig. 11 is a sectional view of an example of a conventional free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator.    First, the structure of this Stirling cycle refrigerator will be described. Inside a cylinder 3 formed substantially in the shape of a cylinder, a piston 1 and a displacer 2, both formed in the shape of a cylinder, are arranged coaxially.    The piston 1 is elastically supported on a pressure vessel 4 by a piston support spring 5.<br>
On the other hand, the displacer 2 has a rod 2a formed so as to extend from a central<br><br>
Portion thereof toward the piston 1, and this rod 2a is put through a slide hole la formed so as to axially penetrate a central portion of the piston 1. The displacer 2 is elastically supported on the pressure vessel 4 by a displacer support spring 6 placed between the tip of the rod 2a and the pressure vessel 4. Between the rod 2a and the slide hole la, a gap is secured to permit the rod 2a to slide smoothly without friction. This gap, however, is made as small as possible to minimize the passage of working gas.<br>
The space formed inside the pressure vessel 4 by the cylinder 3 is divided into two spaces by the piston 1. One of these spaces is a working space 7 formed on the displacer 2 side of the piston 1, and the other is a backspace 8 formed opposite to the displacer 2. The working space 7 is further separated into a compression space 9 and an expansion space 10 by the piston 1 and the displacer 2. The compression and expansion spaces 9 and 10 are connected together by a passage 12 so as to communicate with each other. In this passage 12 is arranged a regenerator 11 filled with a filling (matrix) such as metal mesh. A predetermined amount of working gas is sealed in the pressure vessel 4.<br>
To that side of the piston 1 opposite to the displacer 2 is coupled a sleeve 14 made of a non-magnetic material and formed so as to have an L-shaped section, and to the other end of the sleeve 14 is fitted an annular permanent magnet 15 along the direction in which the piston 1 slides. Thus, inside a gap 19 between an outer yoke 17 enclosing a driving coil 16 and formed so as to have a C-shaped section and an inner yoke 18 fitted around the outer surface of the cylinder 3, the annular permanent magnet 15 slides along the axis of the cylinder 3 in synchronism with the reciprocating movement of the piston 1.<br>
To the driving coil 16, a first lead 20 and a second lead 21 are connected. These leads 20 and 21 are connected, through the wall of the pressure vessel 4 and via a first and a second electric contact 22 and 23, to a PWM output portion 24.    The annular permanent<br><br>
I<br>
Magnet 15, the driving coil 16, the leads 20 and 21, and the yokes 17 and 18 together constitute a linear motor 13.    The PWM output portion 24 feeds the linear motor 13 with in<br><br>
How the conventional refrigerator structured as described above operates will be described. When the PWM output portion 24 supplies  current electric power via the electric contacts 22 and 23 and by way of the leads 20 and 21 to the driving coil 16, the driving coil 16 produces a magnetic field of which the polarities at both ends change at the frequency of the alternating current. In the gap 19, this magnetic field with changing polarities interacts with the annular permanent magnet 15, and causes attracting and repelling forces to act on the annular permanent magnet 15 along the axis of the cylinder 3. As a result, the piston 1, to which the annular permanent magnet 15 is fitted, moves axially inside the cylinder 3.<br>
Suppose that the driving coil 16 is fed with  electric power having a sinusoidal waveform. Then, the piston 1 reciprocates by sliding along the inner wall of the cylinder 3. As a result, the working gas in the compression space 9 is compressed, passes through the regenerator 11, where the heat of the working gas is collected, and moves to the expansion space 10. The working gas that has flowed into the expansion space 10 presses the displacer 2 and is expanded.<br>
As the displacer 2 is pushed back by the resilient force of the displacer support spring 6, the working gas is pressed out in the opposite direction, passes through the regenerator 11, where the working gas receives the heat collected by the regenerator 11 a half cycle ago, and returns to the compression space 9.<br>
In this way, the reversed Stirling cycle is formed, in which the variation in the pressure of the working medium compressed and expanded in the working space 7 causes the piston 1<br><br>
and the displacer 2 to resonate with a phase difference of, typically, 90Â° relative to each other according to the spring constants of the piston support spring 5 and the displacer support spring 6, respectively.<br>
However, during the operation of the refrigerator, if the pressure of the working gas varies abnormally, or the proper gas balance is lost, the piston 1 may move beyond the tolerated amplitude as designed, i.e. out of its permitted range of movement. In the worst case, the piston 1 may collide with the displacer 2 reciprocating with the aforementioned phase difference relative thereto, leading to breakage of a component.<br>
Therefore, in the operation of a free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator, the alternating currentaUemating-current electric power that is fed to the linear motor 13 needs to be controlled carefully so that the piston 1 does not move beyond the tolerated amplitude.<br>
Fig. 12 is a side sectional view of another example of a conventional free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator.<br>
The Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 has a piston 161 and a displacer 162 linearly reciprocating inside a cylinder 163. The piston 161 and the displacer 162 are arranged coaxially. The displacer 162 has a rod 162a formed so as to extend therefrom and penetrate through a slide hole 161a formed in a central portion of the piston 161. The piston 161 and the displacer 162 can slide smoothly along an inner slide surface 163a of the cylinder 163. The piston 161 and the displacer 162 are elastically supported on a pressure vessel 164 by a piston support spring 165 and a displacer support spring 166, respectively.<br>
The space formed by the cylinder 163 is divided into two spaces by the piston 161. One of these spaces is a working space 167 located on the displacer 162 side of the piston 161, and the other is a backspace 168 located on that side of the piston 161 opposite to the displacer 162.    Working gas such as pressurized helium gas is sealed in these spaces.    The<br><br>
Piston 161 is made to reciprocate with a predetermined period by an unillustrated piston driver such as a linear motor. Thus, the working gas inside the working space 167 is compressed and expanded.<br>
The variation in the pressure of the working gas compressed and expanded in the working space 167 causes the displacer 162 to reciprocate Nearly. The piston 161 and the displacer 162 are designed to reciprocate with a predetermined phase difference and with an identical period. Here, the phase difference is determined by the mass of the displacer 162, the spring constant of the displacer support spring 166, and the operation frequency of the piston 161, if the other operation conditions are assumed to be the same.<br>
The working space 167 is further divided into two spaces by the displacer 162. One' of these spaces is a compression space 167a located between the piston 161 and the displacer 162, and the other is an expansion space 167b located at the closed end of the cylinder 163. These two spaces are coupled together through a heat rejector 170, a regenerator 169, and a chiller 171. The working gas in the expansion space 167b produces cold at a cold head 172 located at the closed end of the cylinder 163. The principles of the working of the reversed Stirling refrigerating cycle, such as how it produces cold, is well known, and therefore their explanations will be omitted.<br>
Here, gas bearings are used as bearing mechanisms between the piston slide surface 161b and the cylinder slide surface 163a and between the displacer slide surface 162a and the cylinder slide surface 163a. The bearing effect of these gas bearings results from the working gas compressed by the reciprocating movement of the piston 161 filling the gap between the piston 161, the displacer 162, and the cylinder 163 and thereby permitting their slide surfaces slide without making contact with each other.<br>
Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H7-180919 discloses a method of starting<br><br>
the operation of a crank-type Stirling cycle refrigerator. According to this method, the frequency and the voltage are controlled linearly from the very start of the operation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator so as to prevent excessive current at the start of operation.<br>
However, with a free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 as shown in Fig. 12, in which the spring constant of the displacer support spring 166 and the masses of the displacer 162 and the displacer support spring 166 are so set as to produce resonance at the optimally tuned frequency at which the maximum cooling performance is obtained, starting its operation at previously set fixed frequency and voltage from the start results in greatly missing the resonance point. This causes abnormal oscillation and thus breakage of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115.<br>
Moreover, for example, when a refrigerator-freezer apparatus incorporating the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 has just been installed, and thus the temperature inside the apparatus is close to normal temperature, starting the operation of the refrigerator puts a heavy load on it. Thus, if an excessive input is fed to the refrigerator to make it operate at high power immediately after it starts operating, since the pressure of the working gas has not yet come into a steady state (in which the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 have a predetermined temperature difference), there is a risk of the piston 161 and the displacer 162 interfering and colliding with each other.<br>
When the operation of the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 is stopped, if the supply of electric power thereto is shut down suddenly, the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 stops operating suddenly. This causes a large variation in the pressure of the working gas, and therefore there is a risk of the piston 161 and the displacer 162 interfering and colliding with each other.<br>
When the cooling performance of the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 is<br><br>
adjusted, typically the voltage applied to the piston 161 is varied. The maximum amplitude of the piston 161 depends on the structure of the refrigerator, and the voltage applied to the piston 161 is controlled by a microcomputer so that the piston 161 does not move beyond the maximum amplitude. However, if the input voltage varies, a voltage higher than the rated maximum voltage may be applied to the piston 161. This causes the piston 161 to move beyond the designed amplitude, and therefore there is a risk of the piston 161 and the displacer 162 interfering and colliding with each other.<br>
Moreover, in the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 employing gas bearings, the gas bearing effect is not obtained in low-speed or small-amplitude operation. This causes friction between the piston 161 and the cylinder 163 and between the displacer 162 and the cylinder 163 as they slide, and thus shortens the life of the Stirling cycle refrigerator.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator that prevents collision between the piston and displacer thereof during the operation of the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator.

With this structure, when the position detecting means detects the piston reciprocating having moved out of its-the movable range within which it is permitted to reciprocate, the control means accordingly reduces the input electric power supplied to the driving power source of the piston. This prevents the piston from moving too far out of its movable range and thereby prevents breakage of a component resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer.<br>

Best mode for carrying out the invention<br>
Â«First EmbodimentÂ»<br>
A first embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a sectional view of an example of a free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator according to the invention. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of the controller of the refrigerator.    Fig. 3 is a flow chart of an example of the control method of the refrigerator.<br><br>
Figs. 4 and 5 are diagrams showing the displacement of the piston from the center of its reciprocating movement and the waveform of the pulse voltage fed to the driving coil. In Figs. 1 and 2, such members as are found also in the conventional free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator shown in Fig. 11 and described earlier are identified with the same reference numerals, and their detailed explanations will be omitted.<br>
First, the features unique to the first embodiment will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. On both sides of the driving coil 16, outside the movable range of the annular permanent magnet 15, a pair of position detecting coils 28 and 28 is provided. These position detecting coils 28 simply need to produce a weak electromotive force induced by a change in the magnetic field, and therefore, to save space, they are each formed as a coil of one to two turns.<br>
From the position detecting coils 28 and 28, leads 30 and 30 are laid through the pressure vessel 4, and are connected through an amplifier 31 to a controller 32. The controller 32 includes a memory portion 33 that receives the detection signal (the induced electromagnetic force) from the position detecting coils 28 and stores it, a comparator portion 34 that compares the voltage stored in the memory portion 33 with a previously set voltage, and a PWM output portion 24 that determines an adequate voltage on the basis of the result of comparison and feeds an alternating currentalternating-current electric power having that voltage to the linear motor 13. The PWM output portion 24 is so configured as to output a pulse voltage (see Fig. 4) of which the amplitude is varied stepwise among a plurality of predetermined levels.<br>
Next, an example of the control method of the free-piston-type Stirling cycle refrigerator structured as described above will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 5. When the refrigerator is operating normally, one-to-one correspondence is established<br><br>
between the displacement of the piston 1 from the center of its reciprocating movement and the amplitude of the alternating-current voltage fed from the PWM output portion 24 to the linear motor 13.<br>
However, a sporadic change in the pressure of the working gas or the loss of the proper gas balance causes an irregular change in the undulations of the working gas. As a result, as shown in Fig. 5, the piston 1 may move beyond the tolerated amplitude as designed, i.e. out of its permitted range of movement. In this case, the aforementioned correspondence breaks, and therefore, as long as the -alternating-current electric power is<br>
kept fed to the linear motor 13 at the same power, it is not possible to restore the increased amplitude of the piston 1 to its original level.<br>
Moreover, with the amplitude of the piston I increased, there is even a risk of the piston 1 colliding with the displacer 2, which reciprocates with a phase difference of about 90Â° relative thereto. This may lead to breakage of a component. When the amplitude of the piston 1 increases in this way, the annular permanent magnet 15, which moves in a manner interlocked with the reciprocating movement of the piston 1, passes inside the position detecting coils 28, and thus causes an induced electromotive force to appear in the position detecting coils 28.<br>
Now, how the refrigerator is controlled in this case will be described in more detail with reference to the flow chart of Fig. 3. In step SI, a pulse voltage (see Fig. 4) with a constant period and a constant amplitude is fed from the PWM output portion 24 to the linear motor 13 so as to make the piston 1 reciprocate with the desired amplitude. At this point, in step S2, the detection of the induced electromotive force appearing in the position detecting coils 28 (Fig. 1) is started. The electromotive force is amplified by the amplifier 31 and is then, in step S3, stored in the memory portion 33 in the controller 32.    Then, in step S4, the<br><br>
electromotive force as observed at the moment is compared with a predetermined reference level by the comparator portion 34.<br>
If, in step S4, the electromotive force appearing in the position detecting coils 28 (Fig. 1) is found to be higher than the reference level ("N" in the flow chart), then, in step S5, the amplitude of the pulse voltage fed to the linear motor 13 is set to be one step lower. Then, back in step SI, the pulse voltage, of which the amplitude is now one step lower, is fed from the PWM output portion 24 to the linear motor 13. In this way, it is possible to immediately reduce the amplitude of the reciprocating movement of the piston 1 within its tolerated level.<br>
On the other hand, if, in step S4, the electromotive force is found to be not higher than the reference level C'Y" in the flow chart), then, in step S6, whether the electromotive force is zero or not is checked. If, in step S6, the electromotive force is found to be not zero, then, in step S7, the amplitude of the pulse voltage fed to the linear motor 13 is kept at its current level without being changed. Then, back in step SI, the pulse voltage, of which the amplitude is unchanged, is fed from the PWM output portion 24 to the linear motor 13. In this case, although the piston 1 is reciprocating out of its movable range, there is no risk of its colliding with the displacer 2, and therefore there is no need to bother to change the amplitude of the pulse voltage fed to the linear motor 13.<br>
On the other hand, if, in step S6, the induced electromotive force stored is found to be zero, i.e. no electromotive force is found to have been induced, then it is assumed that the piston 1 is reciprocating within the tolerated amplitude as designed, and therefore, in step S8, the amplitude of the pulse voltage fed to the linear motor 13 is set to be one step higher. Then, back in step SI, the pulse voltage, of which the amplitude is now one step higher is fed from the PWM output portion 24 to the linear motor 13. In this case, the piston 1 is reciprocating within its movable range, but its amplitude may have lowered from the level at<br><br>
the start of operation for some reason. Therefore, the amplitude of the pulse voltage fed to the linear motor 13 is made one step higher by way of precaution.<br>
In the first embodiment, a pair of position detecting coils 28 and 28 is arranged on both sides of the driving coil 16. The same effect is achieved, however, by arranging a position detecting coil 28 on one side of the driving coil 16, because the amplitude increases in the same manner on both sides as long as the center of the reciprocating movement of the piston 1 remains in a fixed position.<br>
In the first embodiment, there is no need to use a driving power source to drive the displacer. This helps simplify the structure of the Stirling cycle refrigerator as compared with a two-cylinder-type Stirling cycle refrigerator that requires energy to make the displacer reciprocate, and also helps reduce the running costs of the refrigerator in operation.<br>
Â«Second EmbodimentÂ»<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. Here, as a Stirling cycle refrigerator, one with a structure similar to that of the conventional one shown in Fig. 12 is adopted.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a block diagram of the operation controller of a refrigerating apparatus provided with a Stirling cycle refrigerator. A voltage supplied from an electric power source 110 is controlled through an input voltage detecting portion 111 by a microcomputer 112, and is then applied through a PWM (pulse width modulation) output portion 113 to a Stirling cycle refrigerator 115. Information on the temperature of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 is fed from a temperature detecting portion 114 to the microcomputer 112.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a flow chart of the operation control of the refrigerating apparatus. First, when the supply of power to the refrigerating apparatus is turned on (step S20), the<br><br>
microcomputer 112 executes an operation start mode, whereby, according to the information on the temperature and the like of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115, the conditions under which to start the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 (step S21) are determined and then its operation is started (step S22). Next, when the temperature detecting portion 114 detects that the temperature of the refrigerating apparatus has reached a predetermined temperature (step S23), the microcomputer 112 executes an operation stop mode, whereby, under the previously set conditions under which to stop the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 (step S24), the operation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 (step S25) is stopped. Thereafter, as time passes, when the temperature detecting portion 114 detects that the temperature of the refrigerating apparatus has risen (step S26), the microcomputer 112 executes the operation start mode (step S21) again to restart the operation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115. Now, various examples of the second embodiment will be described.<br><example><br>
Example 1 is an example of implementation of the procedure performed in the operation start mode (step S21) shown in Fig. 7 in the second embodiment, i.e. an example of the operation start method of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115. In the operation start mode (step S21), the piston starts being operated with a voltage previously stored as the lowest voltage that produces resonance between the piston and the displacer of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 and that permits the gas bearing to function as such, and then the voltage is increased stepwise, for example, every second in predetermined increments until it reaches a predetermined voltage. Here, the predetermined voltage is usually a voltage determined according to the set temperature, and its maximum value is equal to the voltage determined by the structure of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115, i.e. the voltage that produces the maximum<br><br>
amplitude of the piston and the displacer.<br>
The voltage fed to the piston at the start of operation may be any voltage higher than the lowest voltage that permits the gas bearing to function as such. However, the higher this voltage is made, the higher the risk of the piston and the displacer interfering and colliding with each other as result of the pressure of the working gas not being in a steady state.<br>
In this operation start method, the voltage may be increased in any other manner than by being increased stepwise in predetermined increments as time passes as described above; for example, the voltage may be increased gradually with a predetermined gradient.<br>
After the temperature of the refrigerating apparatus has reached the set temperature, the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 may be kept operating, without being stopped, with a somewhat lower voltage fed to the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 so that the refrigerating apparatus is kept at the set temperature. This helps reduce the frequency of the load put on the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 when it starts or stops being operated, and thus helps prolong its life.<br>
With this operation start method, it is possible, in a Stirling cycle refrigerator, to ensure the gas bearing effect, to produce resonance between the piston and the displacer and thereby prevent abnormal oscillation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator, and to increase the voltage applied thereto gradually and thereby prevent breakage resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer.<br><example><br>
Example 2 is an example of implementation of the procedure performed in the operation stop mode (step S24) shown in Fig. 7 in the second embodiment, i.e. an example of the operation stop method of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115.    In this operation stop<br><br>
method, the operation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 is stopped by a reversed version of the procedure performed to start its operation in Example 1. Specifically, in the operation stop mode (S24), the voltage is reduced, for example, every second in predetermined decrements until it reaches the lowest voltage that produces resonance between the piston and the displacer and that permits the gas bearing to function as such, and then the voltage is turned to zero.<br>
The voltage may be turned to zero when it becomes equal to any voltage higher than the lowest voltage that permits the gas bearing to function as such. However, the higher the voltage at which the refrigerator is stopped, the greater the change in the pressure of the working gas, and thus the higher the risk of the piston and the displacer interfering and colliding with each other.<br>
In this operation stop method, the voltage may be reduced in any other manner than by being reduced stepwise in predetermined increments as time passes as described above; for example, the voltage may be reduced gradually with a predetermined gradient.<br>
With this operation stop method, it is possible, in a Stirling cycle refrigerator, to ensure the gas bearing effect, to produce resonance between the piston and the displacer and thereby prevent abnormal oscillation of the Stirling cycle refrigerator, and to reduce the voltage applied thereto gradually and thereby prevent breakage resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer.<br><example><br>
Example 3 is an example of implementation of the operation start method of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115, in which the optimum operation conditions are determined separately by using different procedures between when the operation start mode (step S21) is<br><br>
executed after information on a rise in temperature is given (step S26) in Fig. 7 in the second embodiment and when the operation start mode (step S21) is executed immediately after the supply of power is turned on as in Example 1.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a side sectional view of the Stirling cycle refrigerator of Example 3, and Fig. 9 shows a flow chart of the operation start mode in Example 3. In Fig. 8, such members as are found also in Fig. 12 are identified with the same reference numerals. The chiller 171 and the heat rejector 170 are respectively fitted with, as temperature detecting means, temperature sensors 173 and 174, which are connected to the microcomputer (not shown). The temperatures of the chiller 171 and the heat rejector 170 when the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 is not in operation are measured, and information on these temperatures is fed to the operation start mode, i.e. to step S21 (step S40). Then, the temperature difference between the chiller 171 and the heat rejector 170 is calculated, and, according to the temperature difference, which operation start method to choose is determined (step S41).<br>
When the temperature difference between the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 is large, for example, when only a short period has elapsed after the refrigerator stopped being operated last time, and thus the temperature of the heat rejector 170 is 30Â°C and the temperature of the chiller 171 is -20Â°C, it is judged that quick starting is possible. Thus, the piston starts being operated with the lowest voltage that permits resonance between the piston and the displacer of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115 and that permits the gas bearing to function as such, and then the voltage is increased at shorter intervals than in Example 1, for â¢ example every 0.25 seconds, in predetermined increments until it reaches the predetermined voltage (step S42).<br>
In this way, when the temperatures of the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 are close to their temperatures in a steady state, there is no risk of the piston and the displacer<br><br>
interfering and colliding with each other as may occur when the pressure of the working gas is not in a steady state. Thus, the voltage can be increased quickly to attain the set temperature in a short time.<br>
On the other hand, when the temperature difference between the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 is small, for example, after the refrigerating apparatus has been out of operation for a long period, such as immediately after its installation or after the supply of power thereto has been shut off, and thus the temperatures of the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 are both 20Â°C, it is judged that normal starting is possible, and therefore the voltage is increased in the same manner as in Example 1 (step S43).<br>
In this way, when the temperatures of the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171 are close to each other, the refrigerator starts being operated in the same manner as in Example 1 to prevent breakage resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer resulting from the pressure of the working gas not being in a steady state.<br>
Whether the temperature difference between the heat rejector 170 and the chiller 171<br>
is large or small is checked against a predetermined reference value, for example 40Â°C.<br>
Specifically, if the temperature difference is larger than this value, quick starting is chosen<br>
and, if it is smaller, normal starting is chosen.<br><example><br>
Example 4 is an example of implementation of the procedure performed by the microcomputer 112 when the input voltage detecting portion 111 detects the input vokage causing the piston to move beyond its maximum amplitude in Fig. 6 in the second embodiment, i.e. an example of the operation control method of the Stirling cycle refrigerator 115.    More specifically, in this operation control method, when the detected input voltage is<br><br>
higher than the rated maximum voltage, a voltage lowered down to below the rated maximum voltage is fed to the piston.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a flow chart of the procedure performed by the microcomputer 112. Here, how much the input voltage is higher than the rated voltage is calculated, and the voltage is lowered according to the degree of excess. For example, whether or not the input voltage is higher than the rated voltage by 10 V or more is checked (step S50), and, if the excess is 10 V or more, whether or not the input voltage is higher than the rated voltage by 15 V or more is checked (S51). If the excess is less than 15 V, the output voltage is made one step (for example 10 V) lower (step S52). If the excess is 15 V or more, the output voltage is made two steps (for example 20 V) lower (step S53). If the input voltage is found to be higher than the rated voltage by less than 10 V, it is output intact (step S54).<br>
The output voltage may be lowered when it is higher than the rated voltage by any other voltage, as long as it is controlled not to exceed the rated maximum voltage. Moreover, the output voltage may be lowered in any other steps and in any other decrements.<br>
In Example 4, it is also possible to output a voltage lowered down to the rated maximum voltage whenever the input voltage exceeds it.<br>
With this operation control method, it is possible to control the piston so that it does not move beyond its maximum amplitude and thereby prevent breakage resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer.<br><example><br>
Example 4 deals with an operation control method whereby the output voltage is lowered when the input voltage to the microcomputer exceeds the rated voltage or the rated maximum voltage.    By contrast, Example 5 deals with a method whereby the output voltage<br><br>
is controlled by detecting the input voltage to the piston and thus the stroke of the piston instead of detecting a variation in the input voltage. For example, after the refrigerator starts being operated, the output voltage, which is commensurate with the stroke of the piston, is detected, and, if the microcomputer 112 detects that this voltage is higher than a voltage previously set in consideration of the maximum amplitude of the piston, the microcomputer 112 recognizes that voltage as the limit of the output voltage, and inhibits the voltage from being increased further.<br>
In this way, it is possible to control the piston so that it does not move beyond its maximum amplitude and thereby prevent breakage resulting from collision between the piston and the displacer.<br>
