This invention relates to novel [3-{4-phenylpiperazin-l-yl)propyl] -, [3-(4-phenylpiperazin-l-yl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl]-and [1-(4-phenylpiperazin-l-yl-methyl)cycloprop-1-ylmethyl]-2,4{IH, 3H) -pyrimidinedione, 2,4,6(IH,3H,5H)-pyrimidinetrione, 5,6-dihydro-2,4(IH, 2H) -pyrimidinedione, 1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2^/, 4ii')-dione and 5 , 6, 7 , 8-tetrahydro-2 , 4 (Iff, 3H)-quina-zolinedione derivatives as a^-adrenoceptor antagonists, their<br>
uses as therapeutic agents, and the methods of their making.<br>
a^-Adrenoceptors mediate the contractile state of smooth muscle tissue. For example, hypersympathetic activity produces contraction of vascular smooth muscle which leads to elevated blood pressures.  Thus, a1-adrenoceptor antagonists find use as anti-hypertensive agents.  ai-Ad;renoceptor stimulation also produces contraction of urethral and bladder neck smooth muscle, leading to increased resistance in urinary outflow. Thus, a1-adrenoceptor antagonists are useful in treating<br>
conditions which relate directly or indirectly to obstructive uropathies, particularly obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Lepor, H. The Prostate Supplement.   1990, 3, 75-84).  However, the amount of a1-adrenoceptor antagonist<br>
required to produce a therapeutic effect with regard to urinary outflow, can produce an excessive decrease of blood pressure and/or an inhibition of the mechanism by which normal blood pressure is maintained during changes in posture (i.e., postural hypotension).  Thus, a^^-ant agonists which can selectively reduce a]_-adrenoceptor hyperactivity in prostatic and/or lower urinary tract smooth muscle, without affecting blood pressure or causing postural hypotension, are desirable.<br>

Isomerism is the phenomenon wherein compounds have identical molecular formulae but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space.  Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images are l^ermed "enantiomers" or sometimes optical isomers.  A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a "chiral center".<br>
A compound with one chiral center has two enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality and may exist as either an individual enantiomer or as a mixture of enantiomers.  A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a "racemic mixture".  A compound that has more than one chiral center has 2^~^ enantiomeric pairs, where n  is the number of chiral centers. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist as either an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed a "diastereomeric mixture".<br>
When one chiral center is present a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration of that chiral center.  Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn,<br><br>
Ingold and Prelog and the absolute descriptor i? or S is cited in parentheses followed by a hyphen and the chemical name of compound.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can exist as individual stereoisomers or mixtures of stereoisomers.  For example, compounds of Formula I in which R^ is a group of Formula (c) or (d) can contain chiral centers at the 5- and/or 6-positions of the 5,6-dihydro-2,4(IH, 3H)-pyrimidinedione moiety.  When chiral centers are present at both the 5- and 6-positions two enatiomeric pairs are possible (i.e., the 5^,65/55,61? enatiomeric pair, also referred to as the cis-isomers, and the 5R,6R/5S,6S  enatiomeric pair, also referred to as the trans-isomers). For the purposes of the present application when referring to a compound of F^ormula I by name or by formula and the configuration is not designated, it is to be understood that the reference is to all possible configurations of the compound.     ,<br>
The compounds of Formula I are named in accordance with acceptable nomenclature rules generally consistent with "Chemical Abstracts".  For example, the compound of Formula I in which R^ is methoxy and R2 , R3 and R** are each hydro: is named 3-{3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-l-yl]propyl}-5-methyl-2 , 4 (lif,3H)-pyrimidinedione when R^ is a group of Formula (a), wherein Z is CH and R^ is methyl; is named 3-{3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-l-yl]propyl}-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2,4(IH, 3H)-quinazolinedione when R^ is a group of Formula (a), wherein Z is C(R9) and R"^ and R^ together are tetramethylene;<br>
is named 4-{3-[4-{2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-l-yl]propyl}-6-methyl-l,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H, 4H)-dione when R^ is a group of Formula (a) , wherein Z is N and R"^ is methyl; and is named 3-{3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-l-yl]propyl}-5, 5-dimethyl-2, 4, 6 (Iff, 3H, 5/f)-pyrimidinetrione when R^ is a group of Formula (c) and each R^ is methyl.<br><br>
PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS:<br>
While the broadest definition of this invention is set forth in the Summary of the Invention, certain compounds of Formula I are preferred.  For example, preferred compound of Formula I are those in which R^ is (Ci-g)alkyloxy (optionally<br>
further substituted with one to three fluorine atoms) or heteroaryl; R2 is hydro, halo, hydroxy or (Ci-g)alkyl; and R^<br>

phenyl (which group is optionally further substituted with one to three radicals selected from halo, (C^.g)alkyloxy, (C]__6)alkyl and aryl) and R'^ is carbamoyl, cyano, halo, hydro, hydroxyiminomethyl, hydroxymethyl or (C^.g)alkyl (which alkyl is optionally substituted with one '.to three fluorine atoms) or together with R^ is tetramethylene.<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of Formula I are those in which R-^ is methoxy, ethoxy, 2, 2,2-trifluoroethoxy, oxazolyl or pyrrolyl; R^ is hydro, chloro, fluoro, hydroxy or methyl; and R^ is a group selected from Formulae (a), (b) or (c), in which R^ is hydro, methyl, cyclohexylmethyl, pyridylmethyl, pyrazinylmethyl, furylmethyl, thienylmethyl, biphenylmethyl or a group selected from benzyl and phenyl (which group is optionally further substituted with one to three radicals selected from chloro, fluoro, methyl or methoxy) and R"^ is carbamoyl, cyano, halo, hydro, hydroxyiminomethyl, hydroxymethyl, methyl, ethyl, propyl, trifluoromethyl or together with R^ is tetramethylene; X is CH2 and each of the R^ radicals are hydro or X is CH(OH) and<br>

PHARMACOLOGY AND UTILITY: )<br>
The «!-adrenoceptor pharmacology of the compounds of this<br>
invention was determined by art-recognized procedures. In vitro  assays for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on a]_-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of rat<br>
1  isolated aortic and rabbit isolated urinary bladder smooth muscle are described in Example 38.\ In vitro  assays for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on a]_-adrenoceptor mediated contraction ^of human isolated<br>
arterial, prostatic and urinary bladder smooth muscle are described in Example 39.  An in vivo  assay for measuring the blood pressure lowering effects of test compounds in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats is described in Example 40.  An in vivo  assay for measuring the effect of test compounds on the reflex maintenance of basal blood pressure in response to postural change from supine to vertical is described in Exeimple 41.  An in  vivo  assay for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on a]_-adrenoceptor mediated increases in blood and intraurethral<br>
pressures is described in Example 42.<br>
In summary, the compounds of this invention were tested by the procedures described above and found to selectively inhibit the ai-adrenoceptors which mediate the contractile<br>
state of prostatic and lower urinary tract smooth muscle.  The compounds of this invention will decrease resistance in urinary outflow, without producing the blood pressure lowering effects and/or the postural hypotension that are associated with previously described a]_-adrenoceptor antagonists.<br><br>
Accordingly, the compounds of this invention are useful in treating conditions which relate directly or indirectly to obstructive uropathies, particularly obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br>
ADMINISTRATION AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION:<br>
In general, compounds of Formula I will be administered in therapeutically effective amounts via any of the usual and acceptable modes known in the art, either singly or in combination with another compound of Formula I or with another therapeutic agent.  A therapeutically effective amount may vary widely depending on the severity of the disease, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used and other factors. , Therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of Formula I iti^y range from 0.1 micrograms per kilogram body weight ((Xg/kg) per day to 1 milligram per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) per day, typically 1 |J.g/kg/day to 10 ^ig/kg/day.  Therefore, a therapeutically effective amount for a 80 kg human may range from 8 jxg/day to 800 mg/day, typically 80 |a,g/day to 0.8 mg/day.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I for a given disease.<br>
In general, compounds of Formula I will be administered as pharmaceutical compositions by one of the following routes: oral, systemic (e.g., transdermal, intranasal or by suppository) or parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous or subcutaneous).  Compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate composition and are comprised of, in general, a compound of Formula I in combination with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.  Acceptable<br><br>
excipients are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the compound of Formula I.  Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semisolid or, in the case of an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one of skill in the art.<br>

Alternatively, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by reacting the free acid forms of compounds of Formula I with pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases. Inorganic and organic acids and bases suitable for the preparation of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula I are set forth in the definitions section of this application.  Alternatively, the salt forms of<br><br>
the compounds of Formula I may be prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates.<br>
The free acid or free base forms of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt form. For example, compounds of Formula I in an acid addition salt form may be converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (e.g., ammonium hydroxide solution, sodium hydroxide, etc.). Compounds of Formula I in a base addition salt form may be converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, etc).<br>
The W-oxides of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared by treating an unoxidized form of the compound of Formula I with an oxidizing agent ('e.g., trifluoroperacetic acid, permaleic acid, perbenzoic acid, peracetic acid, ineta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, etc.)^in a suitable inert organic solvent (e.g., a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride) at approximately 0°C.

As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art, compounds of Formula I may be prepared as individual isomers or mixtures of isomers.  Isomers which are diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities.  For example, diastereomers can be separated by chromatography or.<br><br>
preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility.  Optical isomers can be separated by reacting the racemic mixture with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereomeric compounds. The isomers are then separated by any of the techniques described above for the separation of diastereomers and the pure optical isomer recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. While resolution of optical isomers can be carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of compounds of Formula I, dissociable complexes are preferred, e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts.  Suitable resolving acids include tartaric acid, o-nitrotartranilic acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, the 2-arylpropionic acids in general, and camphorsulfonic acid.<br>
Individual isomers of compounds of Formula I can also be separated by such methods as direct Qr selective crystallization or by any other method known to one of ordinary skill in the art.  A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds of Formula I can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. (1981).  Alternatively, individual isomers of compounds of Formula I can be prepared using the isomeric forms of the starting materials.<br>

Gis-3-(3-{4-[4-Fluoro-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl]-piperazin-l-yDpropyl) -5, 6-dihydroxy-5-methyl-5 , 6-dihydro-2,4(IH,3H)-pyrimidinedione fumarate, prepared as above, was dissolved in ethanol to a concentration of 20 mg/ml. A 2.0 ml fraction was injected onto a Chiralpak AS (2 x 250 cm) column, and was eluted with hexane/ethanol/diethylamine (90:9.9:0.1) at 8.0 ml/min, monitoring the eluate by UV absorption at 238 nm. The (+)-enantiomer eluted first, and the (-)-enantio-mer second.<br>
After repeated injections and elutions, the fractions highly enriched in the (+)-enantiomer were pooled and concentrated to give 610 mg (1.28 rtimol) of the free base. This material was dissolved in warm methanol (10 ml), and fumaric acid (148 mg, 1.28 mmol) added and d:i.ssolved. A suspension of a fine powder was obtained on the addition of ethyl acetate (15 ml). The suspension was aged at room temperature, filtered and dried in vacuo, and the solids recrystallized to give 400 mg of the (+)-enantiomer of cis-3-(3-(4-[4-fluoro-2-(2j2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl]-piperazin-l-yl}propyl)-5,6-dihydroxy-5-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2,4(IH,3H)-pyrimidinedione fumarate: m.p. 183.5-192.1°C, [aJn +13.2° (c=0.34, MeOH). The<br>
product was analyzed using an analytical Chiralpak AS column, and found to consist of 94.9% (+)-enantiomer and 5.1% (-)-enantiomer.<br>
Similarly, the fractions highly enriched in the (-)-enantiomer were pooled and concentrated to give 540 mg of the free base. This material was dissolved in warm methanol (10 ml), and fumaric acid (130 mg) added and dissolved. A suspension of a fine powder was obtained on the addition of ethyl acetate (15 ml). The suspension was aged at room temperature, filtered and dried in vacuo, to give 3 56 mg of the (-)-enantiomer of cis-3-(3-(4-[4-fluoro-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenyl]-piperazin-l-yl}propyl)-5,6-dihydroxy-<br><br>
5-methyl-5,6-dihydro-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione fumarate: m.p. 169.5-178.0°C, [aJD -15.6° (c=0.48, MeOH). The product was<br>
analyzed using an analytical Chiralpak AS column, and found to consist of 91.9% (-)-enantiomer and 8.1% (+)-enantiomer. &gt;<br>

a]_-Adrenoceptor In  Vitro,   Functional Assay-in Tissue Isolated from Rabbit and Rat<br>
The following describes in vitro  assays for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on a]_-adrenoceptor mediated<br>
contraction of rat, isolated aortic smooth muscle and rabbit, isolated urinary bladder smooth muscle.<br>
Thoracic aorta were isolated from rats and immediately immersed in Krebs' solution (comprising in mM concentrations: NaCl, 118.5; NaHC03, 25; dextrose, 5; KCl, 4.8; CaCl2, 2.5; MgS04, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; cocaine, 0.03; corticosterone, 0.03; propranolol, 0.001; ascorbic acid, 0.1; and indomethacin, 0.01).  The aortas were dissected free from extraneous tissue and then a cross sectional ring approximately 3 mm in length was cut from the most proximal segment.  The aortic rings were suspended vertically in 10 ml tissue baths and bathed in Kreb's solution maintained at 37°C and constantly aerated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture.  A resting tension of 1 g was<br>
applied to each aortic ring and thereafter periodically readjusted to maintain a 1 g resting tension throughout the duration of the assay.<br>
Urinary bladders were emptied and isolated from rabbits. Bladders were dissected free from extraneous tissue and then a cross sectional ring of bladder neck tissue was cut above the urethra to approximately one third of the way up the bladder. The bladder neck was cut parallel to the longitudinal muscle fibers to give flat section of muscle tissue and then the flat section was cut parallel to the longitudinal muscle to give several flat strips.  Strips of bladder tissue were suspended vertically in 10 ml tissue baths and bathed in Kreb's solution maintained at 33'C and constantly aerated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture.  A resting tension of 5 g was applied to each urinary bladder strip.  The strips were allowed to relax to a resting tension of 1 g and thereafter periodically<br><br>
readjusted to maintain the 1 g resting tension throughout the duration of the assay.<br>
The aortic ring or urinary bladder strip preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 60 minutes during which period the bath solution was replaced every 15 minutes.  The tissue was then exposed to bath solution containing norepinephrine (0.1 to 10 |iM) and once a steady state contraction was produced the tissue was exposed to bath solution free of norepinephrine, replacing the solution twice every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.  The aortic rings were exposed to norepinephrine and the urinary bladder strips to phenylephrine in a cumulative concentration fashion.  That is, the isolated tissue was exposed to bath solution containing a threshold concentration of either norepinephrine or phenylephrine until a steady state contractile response-, was attained and then the concentration of agonist was cvimulatively increased by 0.5 log increments until a maximal or near maximal response was attained.  Norepinephrine produced a concentration-dependent, ai-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of the aortic rings.<br>
Phenylephrine produced a concentration-dependent, a^-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of the urinary bladder<br>
strips.<br>
The tissue was then exposed to solution free of agonist, replacing the solution twice every 5 minutes for 30 minutes. After baseline tension was established and readjusted to 1 g, the tissue was exposed to bath solution containing the test compound, replacing the solution every 15 minutes for 60 minutes.  In the presence of the test compound, the tissue again was exposed to either norepinephrine or phenylephrine in a cumulative concentration fashion, increasing the agonist concentration until a maximal or near maximal response was achieved.<br>
The concentration ratio (CR) of agonist necessary to produce equiactive responses in the absence and presence of the test compound was determined.<br><br>
Relying on the concentration ratio, the assay concentration (molar) of the test compound, and the relationship:<br>
pA2 = - log ftest compound 1<br>
CR - 1<br>
the negative log of the dissociation constant (PA2) for each test compound at a^-adrenoceptors were estimated for both ) aortic tissue and urinary bladder tissue.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 38, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to selectively inhibit the a^-adrenoceptor<br>
mediated contractions of rabbit, isolated urinary bladder 3  smooth muscle.  In contrast, prazosin, an «]_-adrenoceptor<br>
antagonist that has been proscribed for treating BPH, selectively inhibited the ai-adrenobeptor mediated<br>
contractions of rat, isolated aortic smooth muscle.<br>

«]_-Adrenoceptor In  Vitro,   Functional Assay in Tissue Isolated from Human<br>
The following describes in vitro  assays for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on a^-adrenoceptor mediated<br>
contractions of human, isolated arterial and urinary bladder smooth muscle.<br>
Human arterial blood vessels were obtained post-mortem and immediately immersed in cold physiological saline solution.  Within 24 hours of removal the isolated arterial tissue was placed in Krebs' solution (comprising in mM concentrations: NaCl, 118.5; NaHC03, 25; dextrose, 5; KCl, 4.8; CaCl2, 2.5; MgS04, 1.2; KH2PO4, 1.2; cocaine, 0.03; corticosterone, 0.03; propranolol, 0.001; ascorbic acid, 0.1; and indomethacin, 0.01).  The arteries were dissected free from extraneous tissue and then cut into cross sectional rings approximately 3 mm in length.  The arterial rings were<br><br>
suspended vertically in 10 ml tissue baths and bathed in Kreb's solution maintained at 37°C and constantly aerated with a 95% ©2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture.  A resting tension of<br>
1 to 1.5 g was applied to each ring and thereafter periodically readjusted to maintain a 1 g resting tension throughout the duration of the assay.<br>
Human prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle tissue was obtained following radical cystoprostatectomies or radical prostatectomies and immediately immersed in Krebs' solution. The prostatic and bladder tissue was dissected free from extraneous tissue and then strips of tissue 0.8 to 1.2 cm in length and 3 to 5 mm in width were cut and suspended vertically in 10 ml tissue baths and bathed in Kreb's solution maintained at 37°C and constantly aerated with a 95% O2 and 5% CO2 gas mixture.  A resting tension of 0.75 to 1 g was applied to each muscle strip and thereafter periodically readjusted to maintain a 1 g resting.tension throughout the duration of the assay.<br>
I<br>
The arterial ring and prostatic and bladder neck strip preparations were allowed to equilibrate for 60 minutes during which period the bath solution was replaced every 15 minutes. The tissue was then exposed to bath solution containing<br>
^  norepinephrine (1 to 10 |iM) and once a steady state<br>
contraction was produced the tissue was exposed to bath solution free of norepinephrine, replacing the solution twice every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.  The arterial ring and prostatic and bladder neck strip preparations were exposed to norepinephrine in a cumulative concentration fashion.  That is, the isolated tissue was exposed to bath solution containing a threshold concentration of norepinephrine until a steady state contractile response was attained and then the concentration of norepinephrine was cumulatively increased by<br>
5  0.5 log increments until a maximal or near maximal response was attained.  Norepinephrine produced a concentration-dependent, a]_-adrenoceptor mediated contraction of the<br>
arterial ring and of the prostatic and bladder neck strip<br><br>
preparations.<br>
The tissue was then exposed to solution free of norepinephrine, replacing the solution twice every 5 minutes for 3 0 minutes.  After baseline tension was established and readjusted to 1 g, the tissue was exposed to bath solution containing the test compound, replacing the solution every 15 minutes for 60 minutes.  In the presence of the test compound, the tissue again was exposed to norepinephrine in a cumulative )  concentration fashion, increasing the norepinephrine<br>
concentration until a maximal or near maximal response was achieved.<br>
The concentration ratio (CR) of norepinephrine necessary to produce equiactive responses in the absence and presence of the test compound was determined.  Relying on the concentration ratio, the assay concentration (molar) of the test compound, and the relationship:^<br>
pj^P = _ log   ftest compoundl<br>
CR - 1<br>
the negative log of the dissociation constant (pA2) for each test compound at a]_-adrenoceptors were estimated for the arterial ring and prostatic and bladder neck strip preparations.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 39, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to selectively inhibit the a^-adrenoceptor<br>
I mediated contractions of human, isolated prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle.  In contrast, prazosin non-selectively inhibited the tti-adrenoceptor mediated contractions of both<br>
human, isolated prostatic/bladder neck smooth muscle and isolated arterial smooth muscle. 5<br><br>
Example 40<br>
Rat In  Vivo,   Blood Pressure Assay<br>
The following describes an in vivo  assay for measuring the effect of test compounds on blood pressure in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats.<br>
Normotensive or spontaneously hypertensive rats (0.25 to 0.45 kg) were fasted for 18 hours and anesthetized with ether.  The right femoral vein was isolated and cannulated with a fluid filled polyethylene cannulae for bolus administration of test substances.  The right femoral artery was isolated and cannulated with a fluid filled polyethylene cannula connected to an external pressure transducer for monitoring mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).<br>
The rats were placed in restraimers and allowed to recover from anesthesia.  Following a 30 minute period for stabilization, test compounds or vehicle were administered, i.v., and blood pressure was monitored continuously for at least 4 hours post-administration.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 40, compounds of Formula I were j  tested and found to be considerably less potent than prazosin at producing blood pressure lowering effects.<br>
Example 41<br>
Rat In  Vivo,   Tilt-Response Assay<br>
The following describes an in vivo  assay in normotensive rats for measuring the propensity of test compounds to inhibit the reflex maintenance of basal blood pressure levels in response to vertical tilt.<br>
Normotensive rats (0.25 to 0.45 kg) were fasted for 18 hours and anesthetized with ether.  The right femoral vein<br><br>
was isolated and cannulated with a fluid filled polyethylene cannulae for bolus administration of test substances.  The right femoral artery was isolated and cannulated with a fluid filled polyethylene cannula connected to an external pressure transducer for monitoring mean arterial blood pressure (MAP).<br>
The rats were restrained in a supine position and allowed to recover from anesthesia.  Following a 30 minute period for stabilization, test compounds or vehicle were administered, i.v., and blood pressure was monitored continuously while the rats were tilted vertically at 30 to 60 degrees from supine at 15, 3 0 and 45 minutes post-administration.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 41, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to be considerably less potent than prazosin at inhibiting the reflex maintenance of basal blood pressure levels in response to vertical tilt.<br>
Example 42 I<br>
Dog In  Vivo,   Blood and Intraurethral Pressure Assay<br>
The following describes an in vivo  assay for measuring the relative effect of test compounds on hypogastric nerve stimulation-induced increases in intraurethral pressure and phenylephrine-induced increases in diastolic blood pressure in anesthetized dog.<br>
Mongrel dogs (10 to 20 kg) were fasted for 12 to 18 hours &gt;     and anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (35 mg/kg, i.v.). An endotracheal tube was inserted and thereafter the lungs were mechanically ventilated with room air.  The right femoral vein was isolated and cannulated with two polyethylene cannulae, one for the administration of a continuous infusion 5  of pentobarbital sodium (5 to 10 mg/kg/hr) and the other for bolus administration of test substances. The right femoral artery was isolated and cannulated to the abdominal aorta with a fluid filled polyethylene cannula connected to an external<br><br>
pressure transducer for monitoring diastolic aortic pressure (DAP).  The bladder was exposed via a ventral midline abdominal incision and emptied of urine through a 22 gauge needle.  The bladder was cannulated through a stab incision with a water filled balloon catheter connected to an external pressure transducer for monitoring prostatic intraurethral pressure (lUP).  The right hypogastric nerve (HGN) was carefully isolated and attached to a Dastre's electrode for nerve stimulation.<br>
The preparation was allowed to stabilize for a least 30 minutes and must have had a stable basal lUP for not less than 15 minutes prior to commencement of the assay protocol.  The HGN was stimulated (20-50 V, 10 Hz, 10 msec pulse train for 10 sec) to induce a measurable increase in lUP and then phenylephrine (PE) was administered, by bolus injection (0.5 to 0.6 |i.g/kg, i.v.) to induce a measurable increase in DUP.  The HGN stimulation and PE bolus injection were repeated every 5 minutes until three consecutive reproducible increases in lUP and DAP were achieved.  Vehicle (0.1 to 0.3 ml/kg) was administered and 20 minutes later the HGN stimulation and PE bolus injection were repeated.  Test compound was then administered and 20 minutes later the HGN stimulation and PE bolus injection were repeated.  Test compound was administered approximately every 20 minutes, increasing the dose until maximal or near maximal inhibition of the increases in lUP and DAP was attained.<br>
Proceeding as in Example 42, compounds of Formula I were tested and found to selectively inhibit the HGN stimulation-induced increases in lUP.  In contrast, prazosin inhibited increases in lUP and DAP in a similar fashion.<br><br><br>
