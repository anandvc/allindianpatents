				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of. is--D-glucan enriched fraction from cereal flour.<br>
Important cereal grains of  the world  include wheat, rice,  ragi,  barley,  oat.b,  maize,  sorghum and a few minor m: J lets.   Starch and non-starch carbohydrates are the major ons 11 tuent s of cereals.   Horn i ce !. 1 u1os; s represent non-starchy and non-cellulosic polysaccharides, which are quite diverse  in their chemical  structure,  varying  from simple sugars to polymers containing pentoses, hexoses, proteins and phenolics.  Hemicelluloses include fructans, (1-&gt;3)/(1-&gt;4) -S-D-qlucan,  arabinoxylans  and glucomannans  ;soluble  dietary fibres) .    Reference  may  be  made  to  Fleming,M.  and Kawakami,K.,  Carbohydr.  Res.,  5 7  (1977)  15,  for  the information on fS-D-glucan linear molecules associated with peptide  sequences  especially  in endosperm  ceil  walls. Aleurone and sub-aleurone leiyers are the major sites of location, of  these mixed-linkage S-D-glucans  in the cereal grains.<br>
Mixed-linkage S-D-glucans have been reported to contain 70% (1~&gt;4) and. 30% (l-&gt;3) linkages. These linear molecules consist of blocks of (1 - &gt;4) -fS-D-oligoglucosides joined by isolated <l->3) linkages. Thus runs of two or three contiguous (l-&gt;4) linkages are separated by (l-&gt;3) linkages which has been reported by Parrish,F.W., Perlin,A.S. and Reese, E.T., Can. J. Chem., 3 8 (1960) 2094. More than three upto ten contiguous (l-&gt;4) linkages have been observed in barley. It has been suggested that the number and length of the blocks of adjacent (l-&gt;4) linkages alter the properties,<br><br>
particularly viscoelasticity of (l-&gt;3, 1 - &gt;4) -D-glucans as reported by Macgregor,A.W. and Fincher,G.B. in "Barley Chemistry and Technology", Macgregor,A.W. and Bhatty,R.S. ieds. , 1993, AACC, St. Paul, Mmnisota, pp.73. According to recent studies, oat E-D-glucan is mainly ft-(l-&gt;3) linked ceilotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units with 15% by weight consisting of regions containing more than three consecutive S(l-&gt;4) linkages.<br>
These  mixed  linkage  fi-D-glucans  have  beneficial implications in nutrition and health of the consumer. Reference  may  be  made  to  Newman,R.K.,   Lewis,S.E., Newman,C.W., Boik,R.J. and Ramage,R.T., Nutr. Rep. Int., 39 (1987) 749  wherein the hypocholesterolemic effect of barley foods on humans has been observed.   Beneficiary effects of barley S-D-glucan on blood glucose,  blood cholesterol, hormone  responses,  colonic  cancer  and  micronutrient availability are also reported by Bhatty,R.S.  in  "Barley Chemistry and Technology, Macgregor,A.W, and Bhatty.R.S. feds,), 1993, AACC, St.Paul, Minn., pp. 355.  Experiments in chicks and rats and clinical trials in humans have shown that dietary oat. gum to be instrumental in selectively lowering total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol as reported by chen,W-J.L., Anderson,J.W. and Gould,M.R., Nutr. Rep. Int., 24 (1981)  1093. The actual mechanism of cholesterol lowering properties of these S-D-glucans is not completely understood.<br>
Bacterial fermentation of these "soluble dietary fibres" in colon, results in the formation of short chain fatty acids, which in turn will be utilised by the host for<br>
its  own   benefits.      Reference   may   be   made   to .opt enste i a , C , F . ,  Cereal  Foods  Wot id,        (1988  865, ROI-CI J qer , W , E . W . , Cast r oen - ero iogy ,  8 ' I9H2)  424 wherein butyric: acid has been found to be involved m    inhibition of. coi.oi. cancer'.   In view of these beneficial properties there is a demand for soluble S-D-glucans  in pharmaceutical industries.   In this regard,  "oatrim",  a  fat  substitute, consisting of soluble S-D-glucans and amylodextrins from oat flour has gained much attention  as reported by Inglett,G.E . , J.  Food Chem.,  47  (1993)  133.   Reference may be made to Inglett,G.E., Warner,K. and Newman,R.K., Cereal Foods World, 39  (1994)  755 wherein applications of oatrin, a heat-stable gel,  in processed meat,  pasteurized cheeses and packed products including breads, cookies, muffins, and cakes have been documented.   Similarly, barleytrim (soluble S-D-glucan and amylodextrins from barley flour) is getting attention of late.   Hydrolysed S-D-glucan can also be used as a bulking agent for replacement of sucrose.   Barley 6-D-glucan has application as a thickening agent in food industry and it has potential as an industrial hydrocolloid.<br>
The existing methods available for the extraction of S-D-glucans are mostly been used for barley or oats. Reference may be made to Preece,I.A. and Mackenzie, K. G. , J. Inst. Brewing, 58(1952) 353; and Bourme,D.T. and Pierce,J.S., J. Inst. Brewing, 76 (1976) 328 wherein ammonium sulphate has been used for precipitation of S-D-glucan from the aqueous extracts done at 40° and 60°C of the ethanol-refluxed barley flour,  respectively.   The drawbacks are low yield of S-D-<br>
gjucan and involvement of other steps such as dialysis and subsequent; freeze drying.  Reference may be made to Bass, E.J. and Merethi,W.O.S.,  Cereal (hem. ,  3 2 (1955)      374,  wherein papain,  trichloroacetic acid  (54%)  and ammonium sulphate-have   been  used   for   extraction,   precipitation   and fractionation.   The drawbacks are involvement of series or steps such as use of enzyme, acid and salts which need to be removed from the final product.   Reference may be made to Fleming,M. and Kawakami,K., Carbohydr. Res., 57(1977) 15 wherein the ethanol refluxed barley flour was extracted with water at 40°, 65° and 100°C followed by filtration, dialysis, ammonium sulphate precipitation and reprecipitation with acetone.   Although high recovery values are reported, the extraction method seems  to be  tedious  because  of  the involvement of so many steps.   Reference may be made to Fleming,M.,  Manners,D.J.,  Jackson,R.M.  and  Cooke,S.C.,  J. Inst. Brewing, 80 (1974) 399 wherein aqueous extraction is done at 40°C and no prior amylolysis is done.  The drawbacks are alpha-glucan  (starch)  contamination and also very low yield of the product.  Reference may be made to Palmer,G.H., Proc. Amer. Soc. Brewing Chem., 33 (1975) 174, wherein sodium hydroxide (4%) is used at 20°C for extraction.  The drawback is  alkaline  degradation,  resulting  in  ': he  decrease  in molecular weight and solution viscosity which may reduce its bio-pharmacological activity.  Due to involvement of various chemicals and steps in the above said procedures for the extraction of pure 6-D-glucan fraction, the final cost of the<br>
product escalates.   Thus commercially available  (to be imported) S-D-glucans are quite expensive.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of ß-D-glucan enriched fraction from cereal flour which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process which is simple and economical.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of P - D-glucan enriched fraction from cereal flour , which comprises refluxing cereal flour with alcohol for a period of 4 - 6 hours to obtain an extract , separating the alcohol-insoluble residue from the extract by conventional manner , subjecting the residue so obtained to simultaneous hot water gelatinisation and amylolysis using heat stable amylase enzyme in the range of 0.4 - 0.6 ml per 100 g flour to obtain a slurry , allowing the slurry to stand at boiling water bath for a period of 2 hours , separating the residue by conventional method as herein described , precipitating the supernatant with alcohol to obtain P -D-glucan , the said process is characterized in using heat stable amylase enzyme.<br>
