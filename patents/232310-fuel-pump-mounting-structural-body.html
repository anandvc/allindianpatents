[Title of the Invention]<br>
Fuel Pump Mounting Structural Body<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates generally to a fuel pump mounting structural body and, more particularly, to a fuel pump mounting structural body that allows a mounting space and the number of manufacturing processes to be reduced.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
A known example, in a mounting structure for a fuel pump built into a fuel tank, of technique for securing the fuel pump in the fuel tank is inserting the fuel puir.p of a substantially cylindrical shape through an opening portion included in the fuel tank and fastening a flange portion formed on a first end of the fuel pump with a flange portion formed on the opening portion using a mounting bolt.<br>
r - -, r ^ 1<br><br><br>
of the fuel tank and that on the side of the fuel pump. An edge of the flange portion on the side of the fuel pump is bent onto the side of the fuel tank.  The bent portion is then adapted to have a height that results in the sealing member exhibiting a predetermined sealing effect. According to the fuel pump case, the mounting bolt is tightened until the bent portion abuts against the flange portion on the side of the fuel tank, at which the predetermined sealing effect is exhibited. Accordingly, control of a tightening margin of the mounting bolt that achieves the predetermined sealing effect can be easily made by adjusting the height of the bent portion.<br>

[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
In the art disclosed in Patent Document 1, however, an annular surface seal formed of a flat material is used for the sealing member,  ^'nz^s makes it necessary to weld an annular member having a diameter larger than that of<br><br><br>
space required for the fuel pump. Still another problem is an increase in the number of parts used and manufacturing processes involved because of a plurality of mounting bolts for tightening the fuel pump. [0005]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel pump mounting structural body that allows the mounting space and the number of manufacturing processes to be reduced by solving the aforementioned problems of the known art.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems] [0006]<br>
To achieve the foregoing obj ecr, a first aspect of the present invention provides a fuel pump mounting structural body accommodating a fuel pump unit in an opening portion disposed in a fuel tank. The fuel pump mounting structural body includes a step portion, a lid portion, and a guide member.  Specifically, the step portion is disposed in the opening portion and formed one step lower than a wall surface of the fuel tank. The lid pcrrion of the fuel punp unit, is fittingly attached to the s"ep portion ar.d includes a delivery port of fuel.<br><br><br>
present invention, the guide member includes a holding member that holds the lid portion and the holding member is mounted removably, whereby the fuel pump unit is held in position. [0007]<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, the holding member is formed of a sheet-like elastic body, and the holding member includes an engagement portion engaged with the guide member and a pressure portion pressing the lid portion. [0008]<br>
According to a third aspect of the present<br>
invention, the holding member includes a substantially U-shaped engagement portion including the engagement portion and a substantially U-shaped pressure member including the pressure portion. The pressure merrier is disposed on an inside of the engagement member.  Further, the engagement portion and the pressure portion are connected together by a connection portion.<br>
t u <j j></j>
According to a fourzh aspect of the present invention, the pressure ~eirÂ±;er includes a lock portion<br><br><br>
portion is arranged so as not to be released from a condition of being locked with the guide member unless a predetermined operation is executed.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, the lid portion includes at least one protruding portion that abuts on the pressure member to produce a pressing force acting on the lid portion.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, the step portion includes a sealing member disposed on an inner peripheral portion thereof. The lid portion has a bottom portion thereof abutred against a bottom portion of the step portion.  Further, the sealing member is in=de to abut against an outer peripheral portion of the lid portion and the step portion. A sealing effect is thereby produced.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, the sealing member includes an O-ring having a substantially circular cross section.<br>
ICC13]<br><br><br>
separate from the fuel tank.  Further, the base member is attached to the opening portion through a projection welding process.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, the step portion is formed by processing a sheet-like member constituting the fuel tank.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0015]<br>
According to the first aspect of the present invention, the fuel pump unit can be secured in position by the holding member.  This eliminates the need for mounting boles and allows parts involved in mounting to be made more compact.  As a result, the fuel pump unit requires an installation space that is substantially reduced. The arrangement further eliminates the need for a step of tightening the mounting bolts, thus reducing the number of assembly processes.<br>
[0016]<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention, the holding :se:r;ber can be assigned with two following functions simultaneously, namely, a function of<br><br><br>
[0017]<br>
According to the third aspect of the present invention, the holding member can be formed as a single component that connects the substantially U-shaped engagement portion having the function of being engaged with the guide member and the substantially U-shaped pressure member having the function of pressing the lid portion.<br>
[001S]<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the structural body includes ~he lock function that allows the holding member to be moved from a predetermined position only when a predetermined operation is executed.  This allows the fuel pump unit to be removed and reinstalled reliably and easily.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the fifth aspect of the present invention, the protruding portion disposed on the lid portion allows the lid portion to produce a pressing force.<br>
[CC201<br><br><br>
predetermined sealing effect to be stably exhibited.  In addition; the shape of the bottom portion of the lid portion and the step portion of the opening portion defines a specific location at which the sealing member is disposed. This helps reduce the number of assembly processes.<br>
[0021]<br>
According to the seventh aspect of the present invention, space requirements for installing the fuel pump unit can be substantially reduced, as compared with an annular seal by means of a flac member.<br>
[0022]<br>
According to the eighth aspect of the present: invention, it is not necessary to process the opening portion of the fuel tank into a complicated shape having a step portion. As a result, the number of manufacturing processes can be reduced.<br>
[0023]<br>
According to the ninth aspect of the present invention, the arrangement eliminates the need for any base members. This contributes to not only a reduced number of parts used, b*u~ also a reduced overall height,<br><br><br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0024]<br>
A preferred embodiment to which the present invention is applied will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

A rear wheel WR as a drive wheel is rotatably supported on a distal end portion of the swing arm 91. A fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied to the fuel tank 1. [0025]<br>
Fig. 2 is a view illustrating generally the fuel tank 1, to which the fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present invention is applied.  The fuel tank 1 includes an upper member 2, a lower member 3, and a peripheral edge portion 4 of each of the upper and lower members 2, 3.  The upper member 2 and the lower member 3, both pressformed from a steel sheet, are welded together at the peripheral edge portions 4. The fuel tank 1 is thus formed into an integrated container.  The upper member 2 includes a fuel filler port 5 and an opening portion 6 for mounting a fuel pump unit 10, disposed on an upper surface portion thereof. A detachable or openable lid is fitted, when th
 <br><br>
pump unit 10 is serviced or otherwise handled, once the fuel pump unit 10 is mounted at the time of assembly of the fuel tank 1.<br>
[0026]<br>
The fuel pump unit 10 includes a lid portion 13, a main body portion 11, and a strainer 12. The lid portion 13 includes a delivery nozzle 14 that delivers fuel and a connector 15 that receives a drive signal of a drive motor.  The main body portion 11, of a substantially cylindrical shape, includes the drive motor built therein. The drive motor sends fuel in the fuel tank 1 under pressure.  The strainer 12 includes a filter built therein for filtering impurities and the like contained in the fuel.  The main body portion 11 and the strainer 12 are connected zo a lower portion of the lid portion 13.<br>
[0027]<br>
A base 7 and a plate 8 are joined to the opening portion 6. The base 7 serves as a base member for mounting the fuel pump unit 10. The plate 8 serves as a guide member.  The base 7 is joined to the upper member 2 Through a projection welding process as detailed below. Specifically, projections are provided on components of a<br><br><br>
thus localized at the projections, so that melt or plastic flow occurs in the projections to make the weld. The plate 8 is joined to an upper surface of the base 7 through spot welding at four spots. [0028]<br>
An 0-ring 16 is disposed between an inner wall surface of the base 7 and the lid portion 13.  The 0-ring 16 having a substantially circular cross section is formed from an elastic resin or the like and serves as a hermetic seal. The entire fuel pump unit 10 is inserted through the opening portion 6 and then a retainer 20 as a retaining bracket is mounted, so that the fuel pump unit 10 is secured to the fuel tank 1 in a hermetically sealed state. [0029]<br>
Fig. 3 is a side elevational view showing the fuel tank 1.  Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in Fig. 2. A steel sheet 2a forming the upper member 2 is bent substantially at right angles in a direction of the lower member 3 at a peripheral edge portion of the opening portion 6. Projection welding between tie steel sheet 2a and the<br><br><br>
the plate 8 includes a step for allowing a gap from the base 7, through which the retainer 20 can be inserted. [0030]<br>
Fig. 4 is a view illustrating generally the fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present invention. Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in Fig. 2.  Referring to Fig. 4 that is a view seen from a direcrion in which the retainer 2 0 is inserted, installation procedures for the fuel pump unit 10 will be described. The O-ring 16 is first disposed so as to be fitted in a step portion 50 formed in an inner peripheral portion of the base 7. The fuel pump unit 10 is next inserted into the opening portion 6, while being tilted with a leading end of the strainer 12 first. When the whole main body portion 11 is placed in the opening portion 6, the O-ring 16 is designed to exhibit a sealing effect between an outer peripheral portion of the lid portion 13 and the step portion 50 in the base 7.  The retainer 20 is then inserted into a gap 18 between the base 7 and the plate &amp; in tiis condition. This causes a leading end portion of the retainer 20 to slide over an<br><br><br>
direction. Through the arrangements as described heretofore, the fuel pump unit 10 retains a condition of being fixed to the fuel tank 1 unless the retainer 20 is removed. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the plate 8 and the base 7 are spot-welded together at four locations of spot welds 17.  It should, however, be noted that the number of spot welds is not limited to four. [0031]<br>
Fig. 5 is a cross-sectional view showing the fuel pump unir 10 according to the embodiment of the present, invention.  Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in Fig. 2.  The fuel pump unit 10 has a drive motor 3 0 built into the main body-portion 11 that is a cylindrical housing. A vaned disc impeller 3 2 is mounted on a rotary shaft 31 of the drive motor 3 0. When the connector 15 receives a drive signal from an ECU (not shown), thus rotating the drive motor 3 0, the impeller 32 is rotated to draw fuel from the strainer 12. Fuel drawn by a rotating force of the impeller 32 is sent under pressure upward -he fuel pump unit 10, while Lubricating internal parrs cf zhe drive motor 3 0.  The<br><br><br>
fuel. The fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present invention uses the O-ring 16 having a substantially circular cross section as the sealing member for providing a hermetic seal relative to the plate 8. This allows a step portion 40 in abutment with the O-ring 16 to be made substantially compact as compared with a counterpart used in the known system that uses the annular surface seal formed of a flat material. In response to this, the fuel pump unit 10 is configured as having wupward delivery specifications," with which the delivery nozzle 14 and the connector 15 are disposed on the upper surface of the lid portion 13. [0032]<br>
Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) are a plan view and a side elevational view, respectively, showing the lid portion 13.  Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in Fig. 5.  The fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present invention is designed such that, as long as rhe retainer 20 being inserred is once fixed at a predetermined position, rhe retainer 20 can no longer be removed ("hat is, rhe retainer 2 0 is locked in position)<br><br><br>
shapes of the lid portion 13 and the retainer 20.  The lid portion 13 shown in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) includes slopes 13a, 13b as protruding portions at three locations that are brought in abutment with any arbitrary portions of the substantially U-shaped retainer .2 0 as the retainer 20 is inserted.  Each of these slopes 13a, 13b is inclined to rise moderately from the direction, in which the retainer<br>
20	is inserted.<br>
[0033]<br>
Figs. 7 (a) and 7 (b) are a plan view and a side elevational view, respectively, showing the retainer 20. Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in Fig. 2.  The retainer 20 is fanned from a thin steel sheet or the like that undergoes elastic deformation when an external stress is applied thereto and restores to its original shape when released from the stress.  The retainer 20 is supposed to be a flat portion except for a bent portion 25 serving as *a handle. The flat portion of the retainer 20 includes a main plate<br>
21	and sub-plates 23, 24.  The sub-plates 23, 24, which<br>
serve as a pressure member, are connected by a connection<br>
portion 22 with the main plate 21. The sub-plate 23 has a<br><br><br>
of the main plate 21.  xn addition, the sub-plate 24, which is substantially U-shaped, includes a protruding portion 24c at a central portion thereof. The protruding portion 24c protrudes in a direction of inserting the retainer 20. The sub-plate 24 also includes a substantially straight lock portion 24b on an outer peripheral side of each of two bent portions 24a thereof. [0034]<br>
Fig. 3 is a plan view showing the fuel pump mounting structural body according to the embodiment of the present: invention. Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those shown in the foregoing Figs.  Fig. S shows a condition, in which the fuel pump unit 10 is secured in position to the fuel tank 1.  The lock function of the retainer 20 will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to Fig. 8, and Fig. 9 that is a cross-sectional view taken along line A to A cf Fig. 8.<br>
rondel<br>
First, the fuel pump unit 10 is inserted in the cper.ir.g portion 6 (see Fig, 4: and pushed thereinto until a bottom surface of the lid porricn 13 abuts on the step<br><br><br>
the retainer 20 is then inserted into the gap 18 (see Fig. 4) formed between the base 7 and the plate 8 from the left in Fig. 8, the leading end portions 21a of the main plates 21 of the retainer 2 0 slide along the upper surface of the lid portion 13 to be engaged with the plate 8 as the guide member, then reaching the gap IS on the right in Fig. 8. At this time, the leading end portions 23a of the sub-plates 23 follow along the slopes 13b to be varped upward, thus elastically deforming the sub-plates 23.  As a result, the sub-plates 23 press the lid portion 13 with the leading end portions 23a thereof abutting or substantially abutting on a side surface portion on an inner periphery of the plate 8. [0036]<br>
The procrudina oortion 24c of the sub-plate 24. on the other hand, follows the slope 13a of the lid portion 13 to be warped upward, thus elastically deforming the sub-plate 24. As a result, the sub-plate 24 presses the lid portion 13 and the lock portions 24b thereof abut or substantially abut on the side surface portion on the imer periphery of the place 3. Through these operations, "he retainer 20 is subjected zo a lock function, with<br><br><br>
the sub-plates 23, 2 4 warped upward by the slopes 13a, 13b.  It is to be noted that the fuel pump unit 10 may be removed from the fuel tank 1 through the following procedure.  Specifically, a predetermined operation is executed, that is, pressing downward areas near the lock portions 24b of the sub-piate 24.  While the sub-plate 24 is elastically deformed to disengage the lock portions 24b by the predetermined operation, the retainer 20 is pulled out in the withdrawal direction. [0037]<br>
Fig. 10 is a cross-sectional view showing a fuel pump mounting structural body according to a second embodiment of the present invention.  Like reference symbols represent the same or equivalent parts as those of the fuel pump mounting structural body according io the first embodiment of the present invention. A cross-sectional line in Fig. 10 corresponds to line A to A of Fig. S.  The fuel pump mounting structural body according to the second embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that a steel sheet 2b that forms an upper -ember 2 of a fuel tank 1  see Fig. 2) is formed so<br><br><br>
sheet 2b through pressforrning or the like, so that a lid portion 13 and an O-ring 16 are directly engaged with the step portion 51. The fuel pump mounting structural body according to the second embodiment of the present invention eliminates the base 7 separate from the upper member 2 and reduces the manufacturing process of welding the base 7 to the upper member 2.  Further, a reduced thickness corresponding to that of the base 7 reduces a protruding height of a delivery nozzle 14 and a connector 15 with respect to the upper member 2. [0038]<br>
As described heretofore, the fuel pump mounting structural body according to the second embodiment of rhe present invention uses the O-ring having a substantially circular cross section for the sealing member and eliminates the need of mounting bolts. Accordingly, parts involved in mounting the fuel pump unit can be made smaller in diameter, which substantially reduces space requirements for installation.  In addition, the fuel pump unit can be secured in position in a hermetically sealed state by simply inserting rhe retainer, while eliminating<br><br><br>
embodiment of the present invention is adapted to offer the lock function that requires that a predetermined operation be executed before the retainer can be removed because of the shapes of the lid portion and the retainer. This helps remove and reinstall the fuel pump unit reliably and easily.<br>
[0039]<br>
It is co be noted herein that the present invention can be implemenred in a variety of other manners, in terms of rhe shape and material used of the fuel tank, disposition, shape, and construction of the O-ring and retainer.  For example, the fuel pump unit may be mounted on a lower surface side of the fuel tank.<br>
