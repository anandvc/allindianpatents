				<td>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority to and all benefits accruing from a provisional<br>
application filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office on May 5, 2003,<br>
I and there assigned serial number 60/467,995.<br>
j	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a technique for controlling an external device, and more particularly, to a method and apparatus for controlling an external device such as a digital recording/reproduction device via a digital data bus by using auto-play and/or auto-pause functions. Background Information<br>
A digital data bus can be utilized for transmitting digital data in a network among digital devices, such as television signal receivers, personal computers (PCs), display devices, digital video cassette recorders (DVCRs), digital versatile disk (DVD) players, audio/video hard disk drives (AVHDDs), direct broadcast satellite (DBS) receivers, home control devices (e.g., security systems, temperature control devices, etc.), and/or other devices. A digital data bus is typically compliant with a particular standard or specification. An example of a wired digital bus standard includes the Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1394 High Performance Serial Bus standard, which is well known in the art. Wireless digital bus standards, such as Hiperian2, are also known in the art.<br>
In a digital bus network, certain problems may occur when one device, such as a television signal receiver, disconnects from an external device in the network, such as an AVHDD, and later re-establishes the connection with the external device. Such a disconnection and connection in a digital bus network may involve a specific signal protocol (e.g., disconnect request - disconnect response, connect request - connect response, etc.), and may occur when a user causes a network device to switch from one input to another input. For example, problems may occur in that when the connection with the external device is re-established, the external device may restart playing the track it was playing at the time of disconnection from the beginning. It is<br>
likewise problematic if the external device continues to play after the disconnection is made. In particular, both of the foregoing situations are generally undesirable since users are unable to continue playing a track from its then-current point at the time of disconnection, and must either advance and/or reverse within the track to find the exact point where they left off. This process can be imprecise, inconvenient, time-consuming and frustrating for users.<br>
One approach for addressing the foregoing problems is for devices to store and maintain a list of all other network devices that indicates the last state such network devices are in at the time of disconnection. This approach, however, is not optimal since it may be rather complex to implement, and also consumes valuable memory capacity of a device. Another approach for addressing the foregoing problems is to maintain a connection with a network device when switching away from that device. This approach is likewise not optimal since maintaining a connection with a device in a digital bus network may lead that device to falsely believe that it has an avenue to communicate with the other connected device.<br>
Other problems may also occur in a digital bus network as the result of a power interruption (e.g., device turned off, device unplugged, etc.). For example, if a device is connected to another network device at the time of a power interruption, when power to the device is restored, the device may be automatically switched to a non-network input (e.g., antenna input), and away from the network device. This may be inconvenient in that it requires users to manually switch back to the network device.<br>
The present invention addresses the foregoing and/or other problems by providing a method and apparatus for controlling an external device such as a digital recording/reproduction device via a digital data bus using auto-play and/or auto-pause functions.<br>

Referring now to FIG. 3, a flowchart 300 illustrating exemplary steps according to one aspect of the present invention is shown. In particular, the steps of FIG. 3 illustrate how the auto-play function may be used for device control according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of example and explanation, the steps of FIG. 3 will be described with reference to the elements shown in environment 100 of FIG. 1. The steps of FIG. 3 are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the present invention in any manner.<br>
At step 310, apparatus 20 detects the initiation of a disconnection process from external device 40. According to an exemplary embodiment, processor 14 detects the initiation of the disconnection process from external device 40 at step 310 responsive to a user input via user input device 10 which switches the current input of apparatus 20 away from external device 40. For example, a user may provide an input, which causes apparatus 20 to switch its input to a device that is not connected to digital data bus 30.<br>
At step 320, apparatus 20 determines whether external device 40 is in the play mode. According to an exemplary embodiment, apparatus 20 provides a digital command signal to external device 40 via digital data bus 30 under the control of processor 14 at step 320, which enables apparatus 20 to read operating mode data indicating the current operating mode of external device 40, and thereby determine whether external device 40 is in the play mode. For example, with AV/C protocol, a READ INFO BLOCK command signal may be provided to external device 40 to thereby read such operating mode data.<br>
If the determination at step 320 is positive, process flow advances to step 330 where apparatus 20 provides a pause command signal to interrupt operation of external device 40 via -digital data bus 30 under the control of processor 14. According to an exemplary embodiment, the pause command signal provided at step 330 may be implemented using an AV/C protocol PLAY command with a speed variation, although a different signal protocol could also be used.<br>
From step 330, and also when the determination at step 320 is negative, process flow advances to step 340 where apparatus 20 disconnects from external device 40 under the control of processor 14. According to an exemplary embodiment, the disconnection from external device 40 at step 340 may involve a specific signal protocol (e.g., disconnect request - disconnect response, etc.)<br>
associated with digital data bus 30. For example, the disconnection from external device 40 at step 340 may be performed in accordance with the asynchronous and isochronous characteristics prescribed by the IEEE-1394 standard. From step 340, process flow advances to step 350 where apparatus 20 continues with normal operation.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a flowchart 400 illustrating exemplary steps according to another aspect of the present invention is shown. In particular, the steps of FIG. 4 illustrate how the auto-pause function may be used for device control according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of example and explanation, the steps of FIG. 4 will also be described with reference to the elements shown in environment 100 of FIG. 1. The steps of FIG. 4 are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the present invention in any manner.<br>
At step 410, apparatus 20 detects the initiation of a connection process to external device 40. According to an exemplary embodiment, processor 14 detects the initiation of the connection process to external device 40 at step 410 responsive to a user input via user input device 10 which switches the current input of apparatus 20 to external device 40. For example, a user may provide an input, which causes apparatus 20 to switch its input to external device 40 and away from a device that is not connected to digital data bus 30.<br>
At step 420, apparatus 20 connects to external device 40 under the control of processor 14. According to an exemplary embodiment, the connection to external device 40 at step 420 may involve a specific signal protocol (e.g., connect request -connect response, etc.) associated with digital data bus 30. For example, the connection to external device 40 at step 420 may be performed in accordance with the asynchronous and isochronous characteristics prescribed by the IEEE-1394 standard.<br>
At step 430, apparatus 20 determines whether external device 40 is in the pause mode. According to an exemplary embodiment, apparatus 20 provides a digital command signal to external device 40 via digital data bus 30 under the control of processor 14 at step 430, which enables apparatus 20 to read operating mode data indicating the current operating mode of external device 40, and thereby determine whether external device 40 is in the pause mode. For example, with AV/C<br>
protocol, a READ INFO BLOCK command signal may be provided to external device 40 to thereby read such operating mode data.<br>
If the determination at step 430 is negative, process flow advances to step 450 where apparatus 20 continues with normal operation. Alternatively, if the determination at step 430 is positive, process flow advances to step 440 where apparatus 20 provides a play command signal to resume the operation of external device 40 via digital data bus 30 under the control of processor 14. According to an exemplary embodiment, the play command signal provided at step 440 may be an AV/C protocol PLAY command signal although a different signal protocol could also be used. From step 440, process flow advances to step 450 where apparatus 20 continues with normal operation.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a flowchart 500 illustrating exemplary steps according to still another aspect of the present invention is shown. In particular, the steps of FIG. 5 illustrate how the auto-play function may be used for device control according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. For purposes of example and explanation, the steps of FIG. 5 will also be described with reference to the elements shown in environment 100 of FIG. 1. The steps of FIG. 5 are merely exemplary, and are not intended to limit the present invention in any manner.<br>
At step 510, apparatus 20 detects a power interruption. According to one exemplary embodiment, processor 14 detects the power interruption at step 510 responsive to a user input via user input device 10 which switches apparatus 20 from an on state to an off/standby state. During the off/standby state, certain elements of apparatus 20 may still receive power, and apparatus 20 may be switched back to the on state responsive to another user input via user input device 10. According to another exemplary embodiment, processor 14 detects the power interruption at step 510 responsive to a complete removal of power from apparatus 20. This type of power interruption may occur for example if apparatus 20 is unplugged from its power source (e.g., wall outlet), or a power outage occurs as the result of conditions such as adverse weather conditions, utility company problem, etc.<br>
At step 520, apparatus 20 detects a restoration of power. According to one exemplary embodiment, processor 14 detects the restoration of power at step 520 responsive to a user input via user input device 10 which switches apparatus 20 from the off/standby state to the on state. According to another exemplary embodiment,<br>
processor 14 detects the restoration of power at step 520 responsive to apparatus 20 being plugged back in to its power source, or when a power outage attributable to conditions such as adverse weather conditions, utility company problems, etc. is corrected.<br>
At step 530, apparatus 20 determines whether external device 40 is selected as its initial input. According to an exemplary embodiment, apparatus 20 includes an initial input selection setting as part of its user setup process, which allows users to select a particular input of apparatus 20 that is automatically switched to whenever power is applied to apparatus 20. Accordingly, at step 530, processor 14 checks the current user setup data in memory 15 to determine whether the user has selected external device 40 as its initial input.<br>
If the determination at step 530 is negative, process flow advances to step 540 where apparatus 20 switches to its default input (e.g., an antenna input, etc.) under the control of processor 14. From step 540, process flow advances to step 570 where apparatus 20 continues with normal operation. Alternatively, if the determination at step 530 is positive, process flow advances to step 550 where apparatus 20 performs an initialization process in order to enable communication with external device 40 via digital data bus 30. According to an exemplary embodiment, processor 14 executes software code (e.g., IEEE-1394 software code, etc.) to perform the initialization process at step 550 and thereby receives notification when external device 40 is detected on digital data bus 30.<br>
Next, at step 560, apparatus 20 provides a play command signal to start operation of external device 40 via digital data bus 30 under the control of processor 14, which causes external device 40 to begin playing. According to an exemplary embodiment, the play command signal provided at step 560 may be an AV/C protocol PLAY command signal although a different signal protocol could also be used. From step 560, process flow advances to step 570 where apparatus 20 continues with normal operation.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the principles of the present invention reflected herein may be combined in any suitable manner. For example, any aspects of the present invention represented in the flowcharts of FIGS. 3 to 5 may be combined according to design choice.<br>
