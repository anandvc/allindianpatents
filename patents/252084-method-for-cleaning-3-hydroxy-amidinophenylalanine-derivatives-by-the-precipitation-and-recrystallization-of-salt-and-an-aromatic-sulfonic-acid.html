				<td>METHOD FOR CLEANING 3-HYDROXYAMIDINOPHENYLALANINE<br>
DERIVATIVES BY THE PRECIPITATION AND RECRYSTALLIZATION<br>
OF SALT AND AN AROMATIC SULFONIC ACID<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to the preparation of 3-hydroxyamidino-<br>
phenylalanine derivatives in highly pure form which can be used for<br>
example as urokinase inhibitors. The present invention further relates to<br>
the use of high-purity 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivatives for<br>
preparing 3-amidinophenylalanine derivatives.<br>
The urokinase-plasminogen activator system (UPA system) plays a central<br>
role in the metastasis and, in addition, in the growth of primary tumors, for<br>
example in breast, stomach, bowel, pancreatic, ovarian cancer and other<br>
solid tumors. A medical effect can be displayed at two levels through<br>
inhibition of the UPA system: firstly blocking of metastasis, and secondly<br>
reduction of primary tumor growth. 3-Amidinophenyralanine derivatives<br>
represent a class of highly effective urokinase inhibitors.<br>
Preparation of 3-amidinophenylalanine derivatives, in particular of N-a-<br>
(2,4,6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl)-3-amidino-(L)-phenylalanine 4-ethoxycar-<br>
bonylpiperazide (WX-UK1), and the use thereof as urokinase inhibitors is<br>
described for example in CH-A 689611, WO 00/04954 and WO 00/17158<br>
and in the publication by Sturzebecher et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let 9<br>
(1999), 3147-3152). However, the synthetic methods used therein<br>
generally afford relatively low yields of product, because hydrolyzed<br>
TIPPS-OH results as unwanted by-product. One problem is that the<br>
desired reaction product can be separated from by-products only by<br>
elaborate chromatographic methods.<br>
PCT/EP03/08230 describes methods for preparing 3-amidinophenylalanine<br>
derivatives via a 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine intermediate. These<br>
oxamidine derivatives represent highly specific and selective urokinase<br>
inhibitors and additionally have the advantage of oral bioavailability.<br>
However, the problem in the preparation method disclosed in<br>
PCT/EP03/08230 is that the oxamidine intermediates are not obtained in<br>
pure form, and elaborate purification methods are necessary in order to<br>
remove for example amide by-products. However, both for the further<br><br>
synthesis of 3-amidinophenylalanine derivatives and for a pharmaceutical<br>
use of the oxamidine derivatives, it would be advantageous for a method to<br>
be available to allow these oxamidine derivatives to be prepared in good<br>
yield and with high purity.<br>
It was therefore the object of the present invention to provide such a<br>
method in order to obtain oxamidine derivatives in highly pure form.<br>
This object is achieved by a method for purifying 3-hydroxyamidinophenyl-<br>
alanine derivatives, comprising the steps:<br>
(a)	addition of an aromatic sulfonic acid to a solution of an optionally<br>
contaminated 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative in order to<br>
form a salt,<br>
(b)	separation of the precipitate formed in step (a), and<br>
(c)	recovery of the 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative from the<br>
precipitate.<br>
The meaning of "aromatic sulfonic acid" in the sense of the present<br>
invention is an aromatic or heteroaromatic mono- or oligocyclic ring system<br>
which is substituted by at least one sulfonic acid group and/or sulfonate<br>
group. The aromatic or heteroaromatic ring system may additionally have<br>
further substituents which may be selected for example from C1-C6-alkyl,<br>
C1-C3-alkoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonyl, nitro, cyano, oxo or/and halogen.<br>
Suitable aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems include for example<br>
mono- and bicycles having 6 to 20 carbon atoms and 0 to 4 heteroatoms,<br>
which may preferably be selected from N, O and S.<br>
Examples of suitable aromatic sulfonic acids are toluene- and benzene-<br>
mono- or/and -disulfonic acids, and naphthalene-mono- or/and -disulfonic<br>
acid derivatives. Disulfonic acids with a good tendency to crystallize, for<br>
example naphthalene disulfonic acids, are preferred. Naphthalene-1,5-<br>
disulfonic acid (Armstrong's acid) is most preferred. Aromatic disulfonic<br>
acids are frequently employed in the dye industry and there represent<br>
intermediates and coupling reagents for various, especially naphthalene-<br>
based, dyes.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that aromatic sulfonic acids, and in<br>
particular Armstrong's acid, are particularly suitable for precipitating<br>
3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivatives (oxamidines) in the form of a<br><br>
corresponding salt. Salts formed in this way precipitate from a solution of<br>
optionally contaminated 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative crude<br>
products. Suitable solvents in this connection are, for example, ketones<br>
such as acetone and pentanone, esters such as ethyl acetate, polar ethers<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran, bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether (diglyme), dioxane and<br>
methyl tert-butyl ether, halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane, but<br>
also nitriles and nonpolar alcohols. The precipitates can be separated in a<br>
simple manner from the solution in a subsequent step (b), for example by<br>
filtration.<br>
The removed salt can then be purified further by purification methods<br>
customary in the state of the art, and be dried. It is possible in this way<br>
according to the invention to improve the purity of the 3-hydroxyamidino-<br>
phenylalanine derivative even further.<br>
Subsequently, in step (c), the 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative is<br>
recovered. It is possible for this purpose according to the present invention<br>
to react the corresponding sulfonic acid salt for example with bases which<br>
are more basic than the hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivatives, e.g. with<br>
sodium bicarbonate, but also with inorganic and organic bases.<br>
The present invention thus makes it possible in a simple and elegant<br>
manner to remove contaminated reactants, intermediates and unwanted<br>
products, especially unwanted amide contaminants, from the oxamidine.<br>
The method of the present invention is particularly suitable for purifying<br>
oxamidine compounds of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
which may be in the form of racemates as well as in the form of the L or D<br>
configuration compounds, and in which<br>
R1 is a group of the formula<br><br>
in which R4 is<br>
(i) an optionally for example C1-C6-alkyl-, C1-C3-alkoxy-, hydroxyl-,<br>
carboxyl-, sulfonyl-, nitro-, cyano-, oxo- or/and halogen-substituted<br>
C1-C6-alkyl residue such as, for example, ethoxycarbonyl or aryl<br>
residue such as, for example, phenyl, p-halophenyl, naphthyl,<br>
(ii) a saturated or unsaturated branched or unbranched C1-C6-alkoxy<br>
residue or<br>
(iii) an optionally for example C1-C6-alkyl-, C1-C3-alkoxy-, hydroxyl-,<br>
carboxyl-, sulfonyl-, nitro-, cyano-, oxo- or/and halogen-substituted<br>
phenoxy or benzyloxycarbonyl residue,<br>
R2 is an optionally for example C1-C6-alkyl-, C1-C3-alkoxy-, hydroxyl-,<br>
carboxyl-, sulfonyl-, nitro-, cyano-, oxo- or/and halogen-substituted phenyl<br>
residue, such as, for example, phenyl, 4-methylphenyl, 2,4,6-<br>
trimethylphenyl, 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenyl,<br>
R3 is H or branched or unbranched C1-C4-alkyl, and<br><br>
n is0or 1,<br>
Z is N or CR9 where R9 is H or branched or unbranched C1-C4-alkyl.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, it can preferably be employed in<br>
order to isolate N-α-(2,4,6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl)-3-hydroxyamidino-<br>
(L)-phenylalanine 4-ethoxycarbonylpiperazide in highly pure form.<br>
In the synthetic methods disclosed to date for preparing oxamidine<br>
derivatives, the oxamidine compound results in a low degree of purity and<br>
comprises a large proportion of up to 30% of amide contaminant and<br>
further contaminations by reactants and unknown compounds. It is possible<br>
with the method of the present invention to obtain pure oxamidine. The<br>
oxamidine preferably results in a purity of more than 90%, more preferably<br>
more than 95% and most preferably more than 99%.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, no racemization<br>
takes place in the purification method of the invention, so that enantiopure<br>
oxamidine products are obtained.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the purification according to the<br>
invention can be part of a method for preparing 3-hydroxyamidinophenyl-<br>
alanine derivatives. A preferred preparation method includes the steps:<br>
(i) reaction of an N-protected 3-cyanophenylalanine with a piperazine<br>
derivative to form an N-protected 3-cyanophenylalanine piperazide,<br>
(ii) reaction with an optionally substituted phenylsulfonyl halide, in<br>
particular a TIPPS halide;<br>
(iii) conversion of the cyano group into a hydroxyamidino group<br>
(iv) purification with an aromatic sulfonic acid as described above.<br>
In step (i) of the method of the invention, an N-protected 3-cyanophenyl-<br>
alanine is reacted with a piperazine derivative. The term "piperazine<br>
derivative" includes in the sense of the present invention piperazine and its<br>
derivatives, wherein optionally up to four carbon positions in the ring and/or<br>
not more than one nitrogen atom in the ring may be substituted. Piperazine<br>
derivatives preferably employed have a substituent on one of the two<br>
nitrogen atoms in the ring.<br>
Examples of suitable substituents include C1-C6-alkyl residues, saturated<br>
or unsaturated branched or unbranched C1-C6-alkoxy residues, phenoxy<br><br>
and phenyloxycarbonyl residues, and aryl residues such as, for example,<br>
phenyl, p-halophenyl and naphthyl. These may in turn be optionally<br>
substituted in each case independently, for example by C1-C6-alkyl, C1-C3-<br>
alkoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonyl, nitro, cyano, oxo or/and halogen.<br>
It is possible according to the present invention to employ any protective<br>
group for protecting the amino nitrogen atom of the 3-cyanophenylalanine<br>
employed in step (i). Examples of suitable protective groups for amino<br>
functions are known in the prior art and include for example Cbz<br>
(benzyloxycarbonyl), Boc (T-butyloxycarbonyl), DIMOZ (dimetoxybenzyl-<br>
oxycarbonyl), Tfac (trifluoroacetyl), CyOC (cyano-t-butyloxycarbonyl), Phth<br>
(phthaloyl), Bpoc (2-biphenyl-4-isopropoxycarbonyl), Ddz (3,5-dimethoxy-<br>
phenylisopropoxycarbonyl), Fmoc (fluorenyl-9-methyloxycarbonyl), PALOC<br>
(3-(3-pyridyl)allyloxycarbonyl), Tos (p-toluenesulfonyl), NPS (2-nitrophenyl-<br>
sulfenyl), DNPS (2,4-dinitrophenylsulfenyl). Boc is particularly preferably<br>
employed as protective group according to the present invention.<br>
The reaction in step (i) of the method according to the invention forms an<br>
N-protected 3-cyanophenylalanine piperazide.<br>
It is subsequently possible in one embodiment of the invention to remove<br>
the N-protective group again. The conditions necessary for eliminating the<br>
respective protective group are known to a skilled worker. The Boc<br>
protective group which is particularly preferably used according to the<br>
invention can be eliminated for example in acidic medium, e.g. in an<br>
organic solvent such as dioxane or methanol which is saturated with HCI<br>
gas or trifluoroacetate, particularly preferably with 4M HCI (g) in dioxane.<br>
An alternative possibility is to choose the conditions in the subsequent<br>
reaction step (ii) so that elimination of the protective group takes place in<br>
situ.<br>
In step (ii), the 3-cyanophenylalanine piperazide formed in step (i) is<br>
reacted with a phenylsulfonyl halide, which may optionally be substituted.<br>
Preferred halides in this connection are fluoride, chloride, bromide and<br>
iodide. Examples of substituents on the phenylsulfonyl halide include C1-<br>
C6-alkyl, C1-C3-alkoxy, hydroxyl, carboxyl, sulfonyl, nitro, cyano, oxo and<br>
halogen. Phenylsulfonyl halides which are preferably employed are<br>
phenyl-, 4-methylphenyl-, 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl-, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-<br><br>
trimethylphenyl- and especially 2,4,6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl (TIPPS)<br>
halides.<br>
In step (iii), the cyano group is converted into the hydroxyamidino function.<br>
This conversion can be carried out for example by means of hydroxylamine<br>
hydrochloride in the presence of sodium carbonate or triethylamine.<br>
Suitable methods for such reactions are known in the prior art and are<br>
described for example in WO 03/072559.<br>
The 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative formed in step (iii) is<br>
subsequently obtained in highly pure form in accordance with the<br>
purification method described above using an organic sulfonic acid. It is<br>
unnecessary in this connection first to isolate the 3-hydroxyamidinophenyl-<br>
alanine derivative from step (iii).<br>
3-Hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivatives are obtained in this way with<br>
little expenditure on apparatus and in high chemical yield and purity.<br>
The oxamidine compounds obtained in highly pure form with the method of<br>
the invention can be employed for example as orally available urokinase<br>
inhibitors.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, the oxamidine<br>
compounds can be reacted further to give 3-amidinophenylalanine<br>
derivatives. Since oxamidine is in highly pure form according to the present<br>
invention, the yield of amidino final product in the further course of the<br>
synthesis is also distinctly increased.<br>
The present invention thus provides a method for preparing 3-amidino-<br>
phenylalanine derivatives including the steps:<br>
(i) preparation of a 3-hydroxyamidinophenylalanine derivative by a<br>
method described above, and<br>
(ii) conversion of the hydroxyamidino group into an amidino group.<br>
The hydroxyamidino group can be converted into the amidino derivative by<br>
reduction. This normally takes place by catalytic hydrogenation in reactions<br>
familiar to the skilled worker, for example as indicated in WO 03/076391,<br>
WO 03/072559, EP 1 294 742, and in Steinmetzer et al., J. Enzyme<br><br>
Inhibition, 16, 2001, 241-249, Kent et al., J. Peptide Res., 52, 1998, 201-<br>
207 and Stuber et al., peptide Res. 8, 1995, 78-85.<br>
It is thus possible by the method of the invention to isolate the<br>
corresponding 3-amidinophenylalanine derivative with a yield which is<br>
distinctly improved by comparison with methods known in the prior art, and<br>
in highly pure form.<br>

conventional synthesis of N-alpha-(2,4,6-triisopropylphenylsulfonyl)-3-<br>
hydroxyamidino-(L)-phenylalanine 4-ethoxycarbonylpiperazide. The<br>
oxamidine is detected at a retention time of about 21.4 minutes, followed<br>
by the amide contaminant at 24.3 minutes.<br>

Diethyl acetamidomalonate (407 g) is added to ethanol (1 I) at room<br>
temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. The suspension is heated to about<br>
70°C, and a solution of sodium ethoxide (130 g) in ethanol (900 ml) is<br>
added. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for a further<br>
30 minutes. A suspension of 3-bromomethylbenzonitrile (300 g) in ethanol<br>
(1.4 I) is then added to the reaction vessel. The temperature in the reaction<br><br>
vessel is kept at about 70°C for a further 2.5 hours. Then, over the course<br>
of 1.5 hours, dilute sodium hydroxide solution (2N; 2.2 I) is added dropwise.<br>
The suspension is stirred at about 70°C for a further 30 minutes and then<br>
cooled to room temperature. The pH of the reaction mixture is slowly<br>
reduced at room temperature to about 7 by adding concentrated<br>
hydrochloric acid (over the course of about 1 hour). The organic solvent is<br>
removed by distillation under reduced pressure (
The remaining residue is dissolved in 1N NaOH (1 I). The aqueous solution<br>
is extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate (350 ml each time). This is followed<br>
by cooling to 10°C. The aqueous solution is acidified with cone. HCI<br>
(pH = 1). The desired product is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 extractions<br>
with 1.2 I of ethyl acetate each time). The combined organic phases are<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure. The desired product precipitates as<br>
a white solid. The crystals are collected in a suction funnel at 5°C, washed<br>
with small amounts of ethyl acetate and dried at 45°C in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Yield: 243 g (68%).<br><br>
Acetylcyanophenylalanine (940 g) is dissolved in 1N NaOH (4 I) at 37°C.<br>
The initial pH of 12.8 is reduced to 7.2 by adding 4N HCI (approximately<br>
120 ml). Acylase I (37.8 g) is added. In order to keep the pH of the reaction<br>
mixture constant at about 7.2, NaOH (1N) is continuously added to the<br>
reaction mixture. After 72 hours at 37°C, the precipitated product is isolated<br>
by filtration at 20°C. The crystals are washed with water and dried under<br>
reduced pressure at about 40°C. Concentration of the filtrate under<br>
reduced pressure to one third of the original volume leads to precipitation<br>
of further product.<br><br>
Overall yield: 261 g (34%).<br><br>
Triethylamine (310 ml) is added to a suspension of cyanophenyl-L-alanine<br>
(425 g) in methanol (4.5 I). At 25°C, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (488 g) is<br>
added. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight. The organic solvent is<br>
removed under reduced pressure at 40°C. The remaining orange-colored<br>
oil is diluted with ethyl acetate (3 I). 1N HCI (2.3 I) is added, and the<br>
heterogeneous solution is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. A phase<br>
separation is carried out. The organic phase is isolated, extracted with<br>
water and dried with MgSO4. After filtration, the organic phase is<br>
evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at 40°C. Crystals are<br>
obtained on addition of dichloromethane to the residue. The crystals are<br>
collected by filtration and dried under nitrogen at 45°C.<br>
Yield: 554 g (85%)<br><br><br>
Boc-Cyanophenylalanine (554 g) and HOBT (52 g) are suspended in<br>
dichloromethane (2.7 I). A solution of DCC (453 g) in dichloromethane (1 I)<br>
is added. The suspension is then cooled to 10-15°C, and ethoxycarbonyl-<br>
piperazine (347 g) is added dropwise over the course of 30 minutes while<br>
maintaining the above temperature range. The reaction mixture is stirred<br>
overnight. The urea is filtered off and discarded. Saturated NaHCO3<br>
solution (1.8 I) is added to the filtrate. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred<br>
for 30 minutes and then the phases are separated. The organic phase is<br>
extracted with water (2 I) and then dried with MgSO4. The MgSO4 is filtered<br>
off and the solution is concentrated under reduced pressure at 30°C. The<br>
remaining oil is dissolved in ethyl acetate (300 ml). The solution is heated<br>
to the boiling point. Diisopropyl ether (750 ml) is slowly added until the<br>
solution becomes cloudy. The temperature is reduced to 50°C, and the<br>
mixture is left to settle. The temperature is then reduced over the course of<br>
5 hours to 25°C. The product is filtered off and washed with diisopropyl<br>
ether and then dried under nitrogen at 40°C.<br>
Yield: 660 g (80%)<br><br>
Boc-L-Cyanophenylalanine pipamide (442 g) is dissolved in a solution of<br>
HCI in dioxane (4N; 1.2 I). The temperature rises during the addition from<br>
25°C to 32°C. The reaction is complete after 3 hours, and dichloromethane<br>
(1 I) is added to the solution. The desired product starts to precipitate. The<br>
suspension is stirred overnight. An excess of HCI is removed by evacuating<br>
the mixture. The product is isolated by filtration, washed with diisopropyl<br>
ether (0.7 I) and dried under high vacuum at 45°C.<br>
Yield: 552 g (98%)<br><br><br>
2,4,6-Triisopropylphenylsulfonyl chloride (212 g) is added to a suspension<br>
of cyanophenyl-L-alanine pipamide HCI (257 g) in dichloromethane (1.6 I)<br>
at 25°C. Addition of N-ethyldiisopropylamine (238 ml) results in a clear<br>
solution. The addition proceeds exothermically (temperature increase from<br>
25°C to 35°C). Water (1.1 I) is added to the reaction mixture after it has<br>
been stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The phases are separated,<br>
and the organic phase is extracted once with saturated NaHCO3 solution<br>
(1.6 I) and once with water (0.5 I). The organic phase is dried with MgSO4,<br>
filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. A colorless oil is<br>
obtained and slowly crystallizes on standing at room temperature.<br>
Yield: 423 g (-100%)<br>

ethoxycarbonylpiperazide<br><br><br><br>
TIPPS-L-Cyanophenylalanine pipamide (50 g) is dissolved in ethanol<br>
(350 ml). Hydroxylamine HCI (7.3 g) and triethylamine (14.5 ml) are<br>
successively added. The reaction mixture is heated to the boiling point<br>
(~75°C) and heated under reflux for 6 hours. It is then cooled to 40°C, and<br>
the solvent is replaced. Ethanol is removed under reduced pressure and<br>
dichloromethane (300 ml) and water (100 ml) are added to the residue. A<br>
phase separation is carried out. The organic phase is dried with MgSO4.<br>
Filtration is followed by removal of the solvent under reduced pressure.<br>
A white solid (57 g) is obtained and is dissolved in acetone (200 ml). A<br>
solution of Armstrong's acid (15 g) in acetone (150 ml) is added. The<br>
mixture is heated at the boiling point of acetone for 30 minutes. The<br>
Armstrong salt of the desired product crystallizes as white solid. The<br>
suspension is cooled to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour before<br>
subsequently carrying out a filtration. The crystals are washed with acetone<br>
(75 ml), dried and then dissolved in dichloromethane (600 ml). Saturated<br>
NaHCO3 solution (400 ml) is added. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred<br>
vigorously for 20 minutes and then the phases are separated. The organic<br>
phase is extracted with water (400 ml), and then the dichloromethane is<br>
removed by distillation. A white solid (45 g) is obtained. The product is<br>
recrystallized from ethyl acetate/diisopropyl ether, dissolving 45 g in ethyl<br>
acetate (60 ml). Diisopropyl ether (250 ml) is added. The suspension<br>
formed in this way is heated at the boiling point for 30 minutes and then<br>
slowly cooled to room temperature. The amorphous white solid is filtered<br>
off, washed with diisopropyl ether and dried in vacuo at 45°C.<br>
