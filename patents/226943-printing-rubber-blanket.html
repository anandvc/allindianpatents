				<td>The present invention relates to a printing rubber blanket<br>
Background Art<br>
As a printing rubber blanket, one having a surface rubber layer with a smooth surface and a reinforcing layer which is bonded to the surface rubber layer and formed of two to four woven fabrics is known. The printing blanket is used as it is wound around a cylinder.<br>
For example, in printing that uses a lithographic printing rubber blanket, printing ink is applied to a roll-like plate cylinder on which characters and images are formed.  The characters and images are transferred onto the smooth rubber surface of the surface layer of a rubber blanket that rotates in tight contact with the plate cylinder.  Then, the same characters and images as those on the rubber blanket are transferred onto a sheet surface to obtain a printed product.  In printing that uses the rubber blanket, if expansion and shrinkage, i.e., a "shift", occur on the surface of the rubber blanket, the characters and images on the plate cylinder are not transferred onto the printing sheet<br><br>
correctly.<br>
Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 7-81267 has<br>
the following description. In a printing blanket<br>
formed of a support layer including a plurality of<br>
woven fabrics, and a surface layer, of the woven<br>
fabrics that form the support layer, at least one which<br>
is close to the surface layer is formed of a woven<br>
fabric in which the warp which is to extend in the<br>
rotational direction of a blanket cylinder is formed<br>
from polyester mixed yarns. The residual elongation in<br>
the warp direction of the woven fabric is set to 20% or<br>
more. Then, durability against repeated compression in<br>
high-speed printing is increased.<br>
In the printing blanket described in the above<br>
reference, when printing pressure is applied, a large<br>
shift occurs. Particularly, in printing with a highspeed<br>
newspaper press, as the "shift" occurs, the paper<br>
feeding ratio (increasing circumference ratio) of the<br>
rubber blanket increases, leading to problems such as<br>
travel instability of the printing sheet.<br>
According to Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication<br>
No. 2000-343852, paragraph [0009], PVA-based fiber is<br>
used. In the PVA-based fiber, first recessed and<br>
projecting ridges are formed on the fiber surface along<br>
the axial direction of the fiber, and second recessed<br>
and projecting fine ridges are formed in the first<br>
recessed and projecting ridges. This suppresses<br>
a shift between fibers, and the dimensional stability<br>
of the base fabric is increased.<br>
When recesses and projections are formed in<br>
the PVA-based fiber as in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI<br>
Publication No. 2000-343852, the paper feeding ratio<br>
(increasing circumference ratio) accompanying a "shift"<br>
in printing with the high-speed rotary printing press<br>
cannot be controlled to be small. Thus, problems such<br>
as travel instability of the sheet are caused.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present inventors have made extensive studies<br>
and reached the following findings. When the thickness<br>
of the first base fabric layer containing at least one<br>
type of fiber selected from the group consisting of<br>
nylon-based fiber, polyester-based fiber, polyvinylalcohol-<br>
based fiber, polyolefin-based fiber, rayon<br>
fiber, and cotton fiber is 0.17 to 0.33 mm, and its<br>
breaking strength in the printing direction is 20 to<br>
70 kgf/cm, a correlation exists between the residual<br>
elongation of the first base fabric layer of the rubber<br>
blanket and the paper feeding ratio of the rubber<br>
blanket during printing. If the residual elongation is<br>
7% (inclusive) to 15% (exclusive), the shift of the<br>
first base fabric layer during printing can be<br>
suppressed. Consequently, the travel stability of the<br>
printing sheet in high-speed printing can be increased,<br>
and simultaneously the durability can be improved.<br>
An example of a printing rubber blanket according<br>
to the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to FIGS. 1 and 2.<br>
A printing rubber blanket shown in FIGS. I and 2<br>
is substantially formed of a band-like multilayered<br>
material including a surface rubber layer I, a first<br>
base fabric layer 3, an adhesive layer 2 adhered to<br>
the lower surface of the surface rubber layer 1 and<br>
the upper surface of the first base fabric layer 3,<br>
a compression layer 4 adhered to the first base fabric<br>
layer 3, a second base fabric layer 5 adhered to the<br>
compression layer 4, an adhesive layer 6 adhered to the<br>
second base fabric layer 5, a third base fabric layer 7<br>
adhered to the adhesive layer 6, an adhesive layer 8<br>
adhered to the third base fabric layer 7, and a fourth<br>
base fabric layer 9 adhered to the adhesive layer 8.<br>
This printing rubber blanket 10 has one end fixed to<br>
a bar portion 12a of a cylinder 11 and the other end<br>
fixed to a bar portion 12b of the cylinder 11. Thus,<br>
the rubber blanket 10 is wound around the cylinder 11<br>
with a tension being applied to it.<br>
FIG. 2 partially enlarges the wound corner portion<br>
of the rubber blanket of FIG. 1. As the rubber blanket<br>
is largely bent at an acute angle at the corner portion<br>
of the cylinder, a woven fabric layer closer to the<br>
surface of the rubber blanket has a higher tension.<br>
In particular, the first base fabric layer adhered to<br>
the lower surface of the surface rubber layer is highly<br>
likely to be in danger of being broken by a dynamic<br>
impact applied to it during use. Hence, it is<br>
desirable to increase the residual elongation of the<br>
first base fabric layer than that of a base fabric<br>
layer (in this case, second to fourth base fabric<br>
layers) located inside the first base fabric layer.<br>
The first base fabric layer will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
A practical example of nylon-based fiber can<br>
include 6,6-nylon, 6-nylon, and the like.<br>
A practical example of polyester-based fiber can<br>
include polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, and the<br>
like.<br>
A practical example of polyolefin-based fiber can<br>
include polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like.<br>
A practical example of rayon fiber can include<br>
polynosic fiber and the like.<br>
A practical example of polyvinyl-alcohol-based<br>
fiber can include vinylon manufactured by Kuraray Co.,<br>
Ltd, K2 vinylon manufactured by Kuraray Co., Ltd, and<br>
the like.<br>
Above all, a first base fabric layer containing<br>
at least one type of fiber selected from the group<br>
consisting of cotton fiber, nylon-based fiber,<br>
polyvinyl-alcohol-based fiber, and polyester-based<br>
fiber is preferable because it can increase the<br>
durability of the rubber blanket.<br>
The reason why the thickness of the first base<br>
fabric layer is limited within the above range will<br>
be described. If the thickness is less than 0.17 mm,<br>
the durability against dynamic stress that acts on<br>
the rubber blanket due to repeated high-speed printing<br>
is insufficient. If the thickness exceeds 0.33 mm,<br>
cloth marks tend to appear on the printed surface.<br>
The further preferable range of the thickness is 0.17<br>
to 0.25 mm.<br>
The reason why the breaking strength of the first<br>
base fabric layer in the printing direction is limited<br>
within the above range will be described. The rubber<br>
blanket is mounted on the cylinder as it is largely<br>
bent at an acute angle as shown in FIG. 1 described<br>
above. If the breaking strength is less than<br>
20 kgf/cm, the rubber blanket can be broken easily at<br>
its bent portion. If the breaking strength exceeds<br>
70 kgf/cm, the base fabric becomes rigid (the rigidity<br>
increases), and accordingly the blanket cannot be<br>
mounted well. The further preferable range of the<br>
breaking strength is 30 to 70 kgf/cm.<br>
The reason why the residual elongation of the<br>
first base fabric layer in the printing direction is<br>
limited within the above range will be described. If<br>
the residual elongation is less than 7%, that portion<br>
of the rubber blanket which abuts against the corner<br>
portion of the cylinder tends to be broken easily.<br>
If the residual elongation is 15% or more, the paper<br>
feeding ratio of the rubber blanket during printing<br>
increases. The further preferable range of the<br>
residual elongation is 7% to 11%.<br>
The surface rubber layer, compression layer, and<br>
second base fabric layer will be described.<br>
1) Surface Rubber Layer<br>
The surface rubber layer controls reception of the<br>
ink.<br>
As the surface rubber layer, for example, one<br>
obtained by vulcanizing a rubber compound sheet can<br>
be used. As the rubber material contained in the<br>
rubber compound, for example, nitrile rubber can be<br>
enumerated.<br>
The thickness of the surface rubber layer is<br>
desirably within the range of 0.15 to 0.45 mm. This is<br>
due to the following reason. If the thickness of the<br>
surface rubber layer is less than 0.15 mm, recesses and<br>
projections corresponding to the cloth marks of the<br>
first base fabric layer tend to be formed on the<br>
10<br>
surface of the surface rubber layer easily. Then,<br>
the cloth marks of the first base fabric layer may be<br>
reproduced on the printed product, rendering the<br>
printed product defective. If the thickness of the<br>
surface rubber layer exceeds 0.45 mm, the deformation<br>
and distortion of surface rubber of the blanket may be<br>
increased by the pressure applied during printing.<br>
Then, the paper feeding ratio may increase. The<br>
further preferable range of the thickness of 0.2 to<br>
0.35 mm.<br>
2) Compression Layer<br>
The compression layer desirably contains a porous<br>
oil-resistant rubber matrix as a major component.<br>
An oil-resistant rubber matrix is obtained by<br>
vulcanization. When printing is to be performed with<br>
ink that uses a non-polar solvent, as the rubber<br>
material, for example, a polar polymer such as<br>
acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), chloroprene<br>
rubber (CR), fluororubber (FKM), or polyurethane rubber<br>
(UR) can be used. When printing is to be performed<br>
with ink that uses a polar solvent, as the rubber<br>
material, for example, a non-polar polymer such as<br>
ethylene propylene rubber (EPDM) or butyl rubber (IIR)<br>
can be used. The rubber compound desirably contains,<br>
in addition to the rubber material, an additive which<br>
makes a rubber elastic body. As the additive,<br>
for example, a vulcanizing agent, vulcanization<br>
accelerator such as D.M (dibenzothiazole, disulfide)<br>
or M (2-mercaptobenzothiazole), aging inhibitor,<br>
strengthening agent, filler, or plasticizer can be<br>
enumerated.<br>
To obtain porous oil-resistant rubber matrix, for<br>
example, microcapsules may be added, impregnated paper<br>
may be used, or a salt elution method or foaming agent<br>
method may be employed.<br>
The thickness of the compression layer is<br>
desirably within the range of 0.2 to 0.5 mm. This is<br>
due to the following reason. If the thickness of the<br>
compression layer is less than 0.2 mm, the compression<br>
properties may be impaired. If the thickness of the<br>
compression layer exceeds 0.5 mm, tinking down or<br>
packing down of the rubber blanket may undesirably<br>
increase. The further preferable range of the<br>
thickness of the compression layer is 0.25 to 0.45 mm.<br>
3) Second Base fabric Layer<br>
As the second base fabric layer, for example,<br>
woven fabric, unwoven fabric, or the like can be used.<br>
As the constituent materials of the respective base<br>
fabric layers, ones similar to those described<br>
above regarding the first base fabric layer can be<br>
enumerated. The first and second base fabric layers<br>
may be made of the same type of materials, or of<br>
different types of materials.<br>
The breaking strength in the printing direction of<br>
the second base fabric layer is desirably within the<br>
range of 20 to 70 kgf/cm. This is due to the following<br>
reason. If the breaking strength is less than<br>
20 kgf/cm, a sufficient durability may not be obtained<br>
against dynamic stress that acts on the rubber blanket<br>
repeatedly due to repeated high-speed printing. If the<br>
breaking strength exceeds 70 kgf/cm, the base fabric<br>
.becomes rigid (the rigidity increases), and accordingly<br>
the blanket may not be mounted well. The further<br>
preferable range of the breaking strength is 30 to<br>
70 kgf/cm.<br>
The residual elongation in the printing direction<br>
of the second base fabric layer is desirably within<br>
the range of 3% to 7.5%. This is due to the following<br>
reason. If the residual elongation is less than 3%,<br>
the flexibility of the base fabric decreases, and<br>
accordingly the blanket may not be mounted well.<br>
If the residual elongation exceeds 7.5%, as the blanket<br>
is used over time, it tends to meander on the printing<br>
press, causing printing trouble. The further<br>
preferable range of the residual elongation is 3.5%<br>
to 6.5%.<br>
The residual elongation in the printing direction<br>
of the second base fabric layer is desirably equal to<br>
or smaller than the residual elongation in the printing<br>
direction of the first base fabric layer. Then,<br>
a positional shift of the surface rubber layer that<br>
occurs when a printing pressure is applied to the<br>
rubber blanket can be further decreased. Hence,<br>
a change in paper feeding ratio during high-speed<br>
printing can be further decreased, and the registration<br>
can be further improved.<br>
The thickness of the second base fabric layer is<br>
desirably within the range of 0.2 to 0.5 mm. This is<br>
due to the following reason. If the thickness is less<br>
than 0.2 mm, it is difficult to maintain the strength<br>
of the base fabric. If the thickness exceeds 0.5 mm,<br>
tinking down or packing down of the base fabric may<br>
undesirably increase. The further preferable range of<br>
the thickness is 0.25 to 0.45 mm.<br>
4) Third and Fourth Base fabric Layers<br>
The material, thickness, breaking strength, and<br>
residual elongation of each of the third to fourth<br>
base fabric layers can be the same as those described<br>
regarding the second base fabric layer described above.<br>
The second to fourth base fabric layers can have the<br>
same composition or different compositions.<br>
5) Adhesive Layer<br>
The adhesive layers are used to adhere respective<br>
layers that form the printing rubber blanket.<br>
Each adhesive layer contains an oil-resistant<br>
rubber matrix as a major component. As the rubber<br>
material used in the oil-resistant rubber matrix, the<br>
same one as that described regarding the compression<br>
layer can be used.<br>
In FIG. 1, the first base fabric layer is adhered<br>
to the surface rubber layer, but the present invention<br>
is not limited to this arrangement. As far as the<br>
first base fabric layer is arranged between the surface<br>
rubber layer and second base fabric layer, the shift of<br>
the surface rubber layer during printing is suppressed<br>
without impairing the durability, that is, without<br>
breaking the blanket when it is wound around the<br>
cylinder, and the travel stability of the printing<br>
sheet in high-speed printing can be increased.<br>
An example will be described with reference to FIG. 6<br>
in which a first base fabric layer is arranged between<br>
a surface rubber layer and second base fabric layer and<br>
a compression layer is arranged between the first base<br>
fabric layer and surface rubber layer. In FIG. 6, the<br>
constituent members equivalent to those described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2 will be denoted by the same<br>
reference numerals.<br>
A printing rubber blanket exemplified in FIG. 6<br>
has a surface rubber layer 1, a compression layer 4<br>
adhered to the lower surface of the surface rubber<br>
layer 1, a first base fabric layer 3 bonded to the<br>
compression layer 4 through an adhesive layer 10,<br>
a second base fabric layer 5 bonded to the first base<br>
fabric layer 3 through an adhesive layer 10, a third<br>
base fabric layer bonded to the second base fabric<br>
layer 5 through an adhesive layer 10, and a fourth base<br>
fabric layer 9 bonded to the third base fabric layer 7<br>
through an adhesive layer 10.<br>
According to the printing rubber blanket with<br>
this arrangement, the elongation of the compression<br>
layer 4 upon application of a printing pressure can be<br>
suppressed by the first base fabric layer 3, so that<br>
the positional shift of the surface rubber layer 1 can<br>
be suppressed. Consequently, a change in paper feeding<br>
ratio which occurs when the printing speed is increased<br>
can be decreased while ensuring necessary durability.<br>
Also, the registration properties can be improved.<br>
In the printing rubber blanket according to the<br>
present invention, the number of base fabric layers<br>
can be four, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 6. However, the<br>
number of base fabric layers is not limited to four,<br>
but can be two (only the first and second base fabric<br>
layers) or three (the first to third base fabric<br>
layers).<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
First, rubber blankets A and B were fabricated<br>
with the method described as follows,<br>
fabrication of Rubber Blanket A&gt;<br>
Sulfur, a vulcanization accelerator M<br>
(2-mercaptobenzothiazole), aging inhibitor,<br>
strengthening agent, and plasticizer were mixed in<br>
100 parts by weight of medium or high nitrile rubber<br>
(NBR). The obtained mixture was dissolved in methyl<br>
ethyl ketone to form rubber cement I.<br>
Ten parts by weight of microcapsules (Trade name:<br>
Exbancell 092DE with an average particle size of<br>
80 /zm, manufactured by Novel Industries Inc.) made of<br>
a copolymer of methacrylonitrile and acrylonitrile was<br>
added to the rubber cement I described above, thus<br>
obtaining rubber cement II.<br>
A 0.27-mm thick cotton woven fabric having a warp<br>
thread count of 72 threads /inch with 30-strand threads<br>
and a weft thread count of 108 threads/inch with<br>
30-strand threads was subjected to heat (150°C) stretch<br>
forming in the longitudinal direction which is the<br>
rotational direction (printing direction) of the rubber<br>
blanket cylinder. A first base fabric layer having<br>
a residual elongation of 35% in the longitudinal<br>
direction which is the rotational direction (printing<br>
direction) of the blanket cylinder and a breaking<br>
strength of 10 kgf/cm in the longitudinal direction<br>
was obtained. The measuring method for the residual<br>
elongation and breaking strength will be described as<br>
follows.<br>
The breaking strength and residual elongation were<br>
measured by a method to be described.<br>
Measuring Machine: Tensilon (Orientec CRTC-1250A)<br>
Measuring Conditions: Sample had a width of 20 mm<br>
and a length of 200 mm (between chucks).<br>
Measuring Method: Pulling speed was 50 mm/min.<br>
As second to fourth base fabric layers, cotton<br>
woven fabrics each having a thickness of 0.35 mm,<br>
a breaking strength of 30 kgf/cm in the longitudinal<br>
direction, and a residual elongation of 6% in the<br>
longitudinal direction were prepared.<br>
One surface of the second base fabric layer was<br>
coated with rubber cement II to a thickness of 0.3 mm.<br>
The first base fabric layer was adhered to the coated<br>
rubber cement II (unvulcanized compression layer).<br>
The other surface of the second base fabric<br>
layer was coated with rubber cement I to a thickness<br>
of 0.1 mm to form an unvulcanized adhesive layer.<br>
The third base fabric layer was adhered to the adhesive<br>
layer. The surface of the third base fabric layer<br>
was coated with the rubber cement I to a thickness<br>
of 0.1 mm to form an unvulcanized adhesive layer.<br>
The fourth base fabric layer was adhered to the<br>
adhesive layer.<br>
Finally, the surface of the first base fabric<br>
layer was coated with the rubber cement I to a<br>
thickness of 0.05 mm to form an unvulcanized adhesive<br>
layer. A nitrile rubber compound sheet was formed as<br>
an unvulcanized surface rubber layer on the adhesive<br>
layer. An unvulcanized compressive rubber blanket<br>
(blanket precursor) having a thickness of about 2.2 mm<br>
was obtained.<br><vulcanizing process><br>
The unvulcanized compressive rubber blanket was<br>
heated at 150°C for 6 hours, and vulcanization was<br>
completed.<br>
Successively, the vulcanized compressive rubber<br>
blanket was cooled. The surface rubber layer was<br>
polished with 320-mesh sand paper. The 2.06-mm thick<br>
offset printing rubber blanket A having a structure as<br>
shown in FIG. 2 described above was obtained,<br>
fabrication of Rubber Blanket B&gt;<br>
The rubber blanket B having the same structure<br>
as that of the rubber blanket A described above was<br>
prepared, except that the thickness, residual<br>
elongation, and breaking strength of the first base<br>
fabric layer were changed as shown in the following<br>
Table 1.<br>
The paper feeding ratios of the obtained rubber<br>
blankets A and B were measured while changing the<br>
printing pressure. The results are shown in FIG. 3.<br>
As is apparent from FIG. 3, it can be understood<br>
that a change in paper feeding ratio accompanying an<br>
increase in printing pressure is smaller in the rubber<br>
blanket B having a smaller residual elongation.<br>
In actual multi-color printing, the printing<br>
pressure of each printing unit is not always constant.<br>
A change in thickness occurs in the rubber blanket of<br>
each printing unit is used over time. The change in<br>
thickness is not necessarily the same among the<br>
respective units, and accordingly a change occurs in<br>
printing pressure among the units. The change in<br>
printing pressure among the printing units causes<br>
a difference in paper feeding ratio (increasing<br>
circumference ratio of the rubber blanket) among the<br>
units. Consequently, with the rubber blanket B<br>
described above, problems such as travel instability of<br>
the printing sheet and defective registration occur.<br><fabrication of rubber blanket c><br>
A rubber blanket C having the same structure as<br>
that of the rubber blanket A described above was<br>
prepared, except that the thickness, residual<br>
elongation, and breaking strength of the first base<br>
fabric layer were changed as shown in the following<br>
Table 1.<br>
The paper feeding ratios of the obtained rubber<br>
blankets B and C were measured while changing the<br>
printing pressure. The results are shown in FIG. 4.<br>
As is apparent from FIG. 4, it can be understood<br>
that, with the blanket C (Example 1) which uses the<br>
first base fabric layer having a breaking strength<br>
within the range of 20 to 70 kgf/cm and a residual<br>
elongation of 7% (inclusive) to 15% (exclusive), when<br>
compared to the blanket B (Comparative Example 2) which<br>
uses the first base fabric layer having the breaking<br>
strength within the range of 20 to 70 kgf/cra but the<br>
residual elongation exceeding 15%, a change in paper<br>
feeding ratio accompanying an increase in printing<br>
pressure is much smaller.<br>
According to the finding of the present inventors,<br>
when the printing speed varies, the paper feeding ratio<br>
of the rubber blanket (the increasing circumference<br>
ratio of the rubber blanket) also varies. In actual<br>
printing, the printing speed changes at the start and<br>
end of the printing process. When the printing speed<br>
changes continuously, if the paper feeding ratio of the<br>
rubber blanket (the increasing circumference ratio of<br>
the rubber blanket) varies, the travel of the sheet<br>
becomes unstable, and the amount of waste paper<br>
increases. It was also clear that, when the printing<br>
speed changed continuously, the residual elongation of<br>
the first base fabric layer influenced the paper<br>
feeding ratio (the increasing circumference ratio of<br>
the rubber blanket).<br><fabrication of rubber blankets e and d><br>
Rubber blankets E and D having the same structures<br>
as that of the rubber blanket A described above were<br>
prepared, except that the thicknesses, residual<br>
elongations, and breaking strengths of the first base<br>
fabric layers were changed as shown in the following<br>
Table 1.<br>
The paper feeding ratios of the obtained rubber<br>
blankets E and D were measured while changing the<br>
rotational speed of the rubber blanket cylinder.<br>
The results are shown in FIG. 5.<br>
As is apparent from FIG. 5, with the blanket E<br>
(Example 2) which uses the first base fabric layer<br>
having a breaking strength within the range of 20 to<br>
70 kgf/cm and a residual elongation of 7% (inclusive)<br>
to 15% (exclusive), as the rotational speed of the<br>
cylinder increases, the paper feeding ratio increases<br>
at a substantially constant rate.<br>
In contrast to this, with the blanket D<br>
(Comparative Example 3) which uses the first basic<br>
layer having the residual elongation exceeding 15%, no<br>
regularity is found between a change in rotational<br>
speed of the cylinder and a change in paper feeding<br>
ratio,<br>
fabrication of Rubber Blankets F, G, H, and I&gt;<br>
Rubber blankets F to I having the same structures<br>
as that of the rubber blanket A described above were<br>
prepared, except that the thicknesses, residual<br>
elongations, and breaking strengths of the first base<br>
fabric layers were changed as shown in the following<br>
Table 1.<br><fabrication of rubber blankets j k and l><br>
Rubber blankets J, K, and L were prepared by<br>
following the same procedure as that described with<br>
reference to the rubber blanket A, except that as<br>
each first base fabric layer, a woven fabric having<br>
a residual elongation, breaking strength, and thickness<br>
as shown in the following Table 1 and made of mixed<br>
fiber of cotton fiber and polyvinyl alcohol fiber (PVA<br>
fiber) was used.<br>
Example 7<br>
fabrication of Rubber Blanket M&gt;<br>
A first base fabric layer having a thickness, type<br>
of constituent fiber, residual elongation, and breaking<br>
strength as shown in the following Table 1, and second<br>
to fourth base fabric layers of the same type as that<br>
described regarding the rubber blanket A described<br>
above were used. The first to fourth base fabric<br>
layers were adhered in the same manner as that<br>
described regarding the rubber blanket A described<br>
above.<br>
Four parts by weight of microcapsules of the same<br>
type as that described regarding the rubber blanket A<br>
described above were added to the rubber cement I<br>
described above. Thus, rubber cement III was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, the surface of the first base fabric<br>
layer was coated with the rubber cement I to a<br>
thickness of 0.05 mm to form an unvulcanized adhesive<br>
layer. The adhesive layer was coated with the rubber<br>
cement III to a thickness of 0.25 mm. A nitrile rubber<br>
compound sheet was formed as an unvulcanized surface<br>
rubber layer on the coated rubber III. An unvulcanized<br>
compressive rubber blanket (blanket precursor) having<br>
a thickness of about 2.2 mm was obtained.<br>
The unvulcanized compressive rubber blanket was<br>
subjected to vulcanization, cooling, and polishing in<br>
the same manner as that described regarding the rubber<br>
blanket A described above. A rubber blanket M for<br>
offset printing was obtained.<br>
Comparative Example 7<br><fabrication of rubber blanket n><br>
First to fourth base fabric layers of the same<br>
type as that described regarding the rubber blanket A<br>
described above were adhered in the same manner as that<br>
described regarding the rubber blanket A described<br>
above.<br>
Subsequently, the surface of the first base<br>
fabric layer was coated with the rubber cement I to<br>
a thickness of 0.05 mm to form an unvulcanized adhesive<br>
layer. The adhesive layer was coated with the rubber<br>
cement III to a thickness of 0.25 mm. A nitrile rubber<br>
compound sheet was formed as an unvulcanized surface<br>
rubber layer on the coated rubber III. An unvulcanized<br>
compressive rubber blanket (blanket precursor) having<br>
a thickness of about 2.2 mm was obtained.<br>
The unvulcanized compressive rubber blanket was<br>
subjected to vulcanization, cooling, and polishing in<br>
the same manner as that described regarding the rubber<br>
blanket A described above. A rubber blanket N for<br>
offset printing was obtained.<br>
The characteristics of the rubber blankets A to N<br>
were evaluated in accordance with a method described<br>
below. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br><change in paper feeding ratio upon speed change><br>
The speed was changed from 0 to 500 rpm stepwise<br>
for each rubber blanket. The paper feeding ratio upon<br>
application of a printing pressure of 0.2 mm was<br>
measured for each rotational speed, and its change was<br>
observed. Those in which the change amount of the<br>
paper feeding ratio (a difference between the maximum<br>
and minimum paper feeding ratios) was of less than 0.2%<br>
upon a speed change are indicated by ©, those in which<br>
the change amount was 0.2% (inclusive) to 0.3%<br>
(exclusive) are indicated by O, and those in which the<br>
change amount was 0.3% or more are indicated by X.<br><presence of cloth mark during printing><br>
Whether or not a cloth mark appeared in the<br>
printed product test with a printing test using an RI<br>
tester (portable printing tester: Akira Seisakusho) was<br>
determined for each rubber blanket. Those which<br>
produced no cloth marks are indicated by O, and those<br>
which produced cloth marks are expressed as X .<br><durability of first base fabric layer><br>
The durability was tested with a blanket<br>
durability tester. Those which caused no problems<br>
with the blanket durability tester until 5,000,000<br>
revolutions are indicated by O, and those which caused<br>
a problem in durability before 5,000,000 revolutions<br>
are indicated by X .<br>
Registration Properties&gt;<br>
Registration properties refer to the overlaying<br>
alignment accuracy in multi-color printing. Those with<br>
which no "blur" or "shift" occurred in the register<br>
mark (registration index printed in the margin of the<br>
printing product during printing) are indicated by O,<br>
and those which had poor registration properties are<br>
indicated by X .<br><br>
In the overall evaluation of Table 1, those in<br>
which all of the four items, i.e., a change in paper<br>
feeding ratio, presence/absence of a cloth mark,<br>
durability, and registration properties are O are<br>
indicated as O, of which those which had any © are<br>
indicated as ©. Those which had X for at least one of<br>
four items are indicated as X .<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As is apparent from Table 1, it can be understood<br>
that the rubber blankets (blankets C, E, H, J, K, L,<br>
and M) of Examples 1 to 7, each including the first<br>
base fabric layer having a thickness within the range<br>
of 0.17 to 0.33 mm, a residual elongation within the<br>
range 7% (inclusive) to 15% (exclusive) in the printing<br>
direction, and a breaking strength within the range<br>
of 20 to 70 kgf/cm in the printing direction, are<br>
excellent in all of a change in paper feeding ratio<br>
upon a speed change, the presence/absence of a cloth<br>
mark during printing, the durability of the first base<br>
fabric layer, and the registration properties of the<br>
rubber blanket. Above all, each of the rubber blankets<br>
of Examples 4 to 6 which had a thickness of 0.17 to<br>
0.25 mm, a residual elongation of 7% to 11%, and a<br>
breaking strength of 30 to 70 kgf/cm was excellent as<br>
its change in paper feeding ratio upon a speed change<br>
was less than 0.2%. The smaller the change amount of<br>
the paper feeding ratio upon a speed change, the better<br>
the printing product that does not depend on the<br>
printing speed that can be obtained.<br>
In contrast to this, the rubber blanket (blanket<br>
A) of Comparative Example 1, which had a residual<br>
elongation of 15% or more and a breaking strength of<br>
less than 20 kgf/cm, was inferior in the change in<br>
paper feeding ratio upon a speed change, durability,<br>
and registration properties. If the change amount of<br>
the paper feeding ratio is 0.3% or more, the resulting<br>
printed product has a problem. The rubber blankets<br>
(blankets B and D) of Comparative Examples 2 and 3,<br>
each of which had a residual elongation of larger<br>
than 15%, were inferior in registration properties.<br>
The rubber blanket (blanket I) of Comparative Example 4<br>
which had a residual elongation of less than 7% was<br>
inferior in durability. With the rubber blanket<br>
(blanket F) of Comparative Example 5 which had a<br>
thickness exceeding 0.33 mm, a cloth mark appeared on<br>
the printed product. When the rubber blanket (blanket<br>
G) of Comparative Example 6 had a thickness of less<br>
than 0.17 mm and a breaking strength of less than<br>
20 kgf/cm, the change in paper feeding ratio upon<br>
a speed change was small, and the durability was low.<br>
In Comparative Example 7 (rubber blanket N),<br>
although the first base fabric layer was arranged<br>
between the surface rubber layer and second base fabric<br>
layer, the first base fabric layer had a residual<br>
elongation of 15% or more and a breaking strength of<br>
smaller than 20 kgf/cm. Thus, this rubber blanket was<br>
inferior in change in paper feeding ratio, durability,<br>
and registration properties.<br>
