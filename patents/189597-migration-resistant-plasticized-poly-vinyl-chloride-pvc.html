The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of migration resistant plasticized poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC). Plasticized PVC is one of the most widely used polymeric material in the medical field for the manufacture of blood bags, trans¬fusion tubings, urine bags, crystalloid sets, etc. and also for packaging food stuffs and pharmaceuticals. Plasticizers are chemicals that are added to a polymer to increase its work¬ability, distensibi1ity, flexibility and low temperature proper¬ties. A plasticizer is a molecule which modifies a resin so that one can start with a basic resin, develop different products with different properties and applications. Briefly, piasticization on the molecular level is the weakening or masking of selective bonds between polymer chains, while leaving others strong, to make possible the shaping, flexing or molding of the material. This is accompanied by an increase in intermolecular space, which allows the change in shape. There are many different kinds of plasticizers and di-
DEHP which is a moderately high molecular weight plasticizer ( M W 390) is commonly employed in the production of plasticized PVC. Without plasticizer P^C is a rigid plastic. Plasticized PVC usually contains upto 40% by weight of this plasticizer (Ljunggren,  Artif.  Organs., 8, 99,  1984).  Plasticizers  often<br><br>
possess, high mobility, and they can easily migrate from PVC to the environment. This not only results in the deterioration of PVC, but also in the contamination of the product by the plas— ticizer if PVC is used in food packaging or medical applications such as blood bag. DEHP can produce adverse effects in putuitary gland tissues, liver abnormalities, testicular damage (Lake et al.. Environ. Health, pers., 67, 203, 1986) and also can act as a potential carcinogen (Kluwe et al., Toxicol. Environ. Health, 10, 797, 1982).<br>
Several different approaches have been made to retard or prevent the migration of DEHP from plasticized PVC. Coating the PVC surface with various polymers, crosslinking PVC during processing using peroxides, irradiation in presence of multifunctional monomers (See for eg. Duvis et al., J Appln. Polym. Sci., 42, 191, 1991 and reference therein), grafting hydrophilic monomers onto the surface of PVC by gamms irradiation (Krishnan et al. , Biomaterials, 12, 489, 1991) plasma treatment of PVC surface (Iriyama and Yasuda, J Appl. Polym. Sci., Appl. Polym. (Symp., 42, 97, 1986), coating with dithiocarbamate substituted PVC and heating to crosslink the surface of PVC (Levinf US Patent 4806393, 1986) are some of the methods reported in the published and patent literature to retard the migration of the plasticizer. However, all these techniques have severe limitations and none of them prevents the migration completely or near completely.<br><br>
An  object  of  this invention is to propose a  process  for  the<br>
preparation of miciration resistant polyvinyl chloride by  surface<br>
modification using phase transfer catalysis.<br>
Thus  according to this invention is provided a process  for  the<br>
preparation  of  migration  resistant  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)<br>
comprising  in  the  steps of treating  cleaned  plasticized  PVC<br>
tubing  with a solution of an alkali metal salt of a  nucleophile<br>
selected  from  thiosulphate and sulphide, in the presence  of  a<br>
phase  transfer  catalyst (PTC) such as herein  described,  at  a<br>
o temperature  in  the range of 60 to 80 C for 5 hrs.  followed  by<br>
washing  the  tubings and drying to  obtain  migration  rf<istant></istant>
polyvinyl  chloride  wherein said alkali metal salt  is  selected<br>
from sodium, potassium and ammonium salt.<br>
In  accordance with this invention, there iS, provided  a  process<br>
for  the preparation of migration-resJ«tant poly(vinyl  chloride)<br>
(PVC)  by the nucleophilic substitution of the chlorine atoms  on<br>
PVC by nucleophiles such as thiosulphate and sulphide on  plasti-<br>
cizers PVC by phase transfer catalysis.<br>
PTCs  are  those wich can transfer one reactant from  its  normal<br>
phase  ir«;o the normal phase of the second reactant and that  the<br>
transferred  reagent will be available in a highly  active  form.<br>
The  reaction  is conducted using any alkali salts  of  the  said<br>
nucleophiles  such  as sodium, potassium or ammonium  salts.  The<br>
plasticized PVC is in a physical form such as sheets, tubings  or<br><br>
any devices made out of sheets, and tubings or plasticized PVC molded in any physical form. By way of example, the plasticized PVC tubes or sheets are claned by sonication in a bath type sonicator and treated with the alkali metal solution of thio-sulphate or a sulphide in water in presence of a PTC. The PTC is Euch as tetrsbutyl ammonium hydrogen sulphate (TBAH), or any other compound which has the characteristics of a typical PTC such as tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (TABI), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB), he&gt;:a—decyl trimethyl ammonium bromide v'HTMAB), benzyl tri ethyl ammo-nium chloride (BTAC) and 1.8 crown-6 (1SC6) . The concentration of the aqueous alkali metal salt solution of thiosulphate is 2.5 to 5.0li, preferably 5.0li and the concentra¬tion  of  the alkali metal salt solution of sulphide is  4.0M  to<br>
9.0M, preferably 7.0M. The reaction is carried out in the  tempe-<br>
o rature  range of 60—80 C for various periods of time.  Here,  the<br>
2-PTC  (TBAH)  will bring S     O  Na or S.   groups from  the  aqueous<br>
2 3 phase  to the solid PVC, where exchange of anions  with  chlorine<br>
atom  takes place. These chlorine atoms are taken to the  aqueous<br>
phase  by PTC. A concentration of PTC from 0.05 to 0.30M is  used<br>
with the alkali metal thiosulphate and from 0.01 to 0.20M is used<br>
with the alkali metal sulphide solution. The treated PVC  tubings<br>
or  sheets are   finally washed and dried in a vacuum oven at  room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
It  is presumed that -S-S- type or crosslinking is formed on  the<br>
surface  of PVC   using thiosulphate and —S- type in the  case  of<br>
sodium sulphide.<br>
SURFACE MODIFICATION WITH SODIUM THIOSULPHATE<br>
Example<br>
Medical grade PVC tubing was cleaned by sonication in a bath type<br>
sonicator in distilled water for 5 mins.. Pieces of tubes  having<br>
approximately  1.5 cm in length were treated with a  solution  of<br>
sodium  thiosulphate  having  a  concentration  of  3.(3M  in  the<br>
o presence  of  0-15M TBAH in 10 ml distilled water at 30 C  for  5<br>
hrs. with occasional shaking. After the reaction, the tubes  were<br>
washed well with water.<br>
SURFACE MODIFICATION WITH SODIUM SULPHIDE<br>
Example<br>
About 1.5 cm long PVC tubes were treated with 10 mL of 7M  sodium<br>
o sulphide  0.15M TBAH 80 C for 5 hrs.. The tubes were then  washed<br>
well with water and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature.<br><br><br>
