INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates generally to wireless communication systems, and more particularly to a method and system for detecting the presence of on-off signaling in a wireless communications network.<br>
Quick paging channel (QPCH) is an uncoded channel used in CDMA based telecommunication networks for transferring on-off signaling. The channel carries various indicators such as paging indicators, broadcast indicators, and configuration change indicators. The discussion below will use a specific indicator such as the paging indicator as an example, it is understood that whatever can be applied to paging indicator can also be applied to other indicators carried by the QPCH.<br>
In a wireless communications network, a mobile terminal remains in an idle mode to conserve battery power when there is neither voice nor data call. In the idle mode, the mobile terminal wakes up periodically for a short period, typically in the<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
-2-<br><br>
order of milliseconds, to monitor a paging indicator to detect whether there is a paging made to the mobile terminal. A relative simple predetermined algorithm is typically used to decide whether the paging indicator indicates that there is an ongoing or an up-and-coming voice or data call. If the outcome of the predetermined algorithm is affirmative, the mobile terminal switches on to decode information communicated through a common channel, which may contain a dedicated or broadcast message in a temporal period of up to 100ms. If the final determination based on the simple algorithm is negative, the mobile terminal returns to a "sleep mode", wherein most of the mobile terminal's components are turned off to conserve battery power while keeping a few critical components on to maintain basic timing requirement during the "sleep mode". As known by those skilled in the art, the more often the mobile terminal has to decode information in the common channel, the more power the mobile terminal must consume. As such, there is a need to increase standby time, or the amount of time that the mobile terminal is in "sleep mode".<br>
To increase the standby time, a wireless communication system that regularly communicates with the mobile terminal transmits the same paging indicator several times over time to indicate whether there is a paging to the mobile terminal. For example, 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 describes a quick paging channel designed for this purpose in a CDMA2000 environment. "Physical Layer Standard for CDMA2000 Spread Spectrum Systems," 3GPP2 C.S0002, March, 2000. See also "Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signaling Standard for CDMA2000 Spread Spectrum Systems (2000)", 3GPP2 C.S0005, March, 2000. The QPCH indicators are normally on/off keyed to reduce transmission power. The paging indicators are used to signal the mobile terminal about the presence of a paging message in a predetermined paging slot in the QPCH.   If the paging indicator is on, the mobile<br><br><br><br>
-3-<br><br>
terminal should wake up and be able to receive the paging. If the paging indicator is off, the mobile terminal can continue to stay in idle to save power. The indicator is repeated once to obtain temporal fading diversity information.<br>
To conserve battery power, it is critical to detecting the presence of the paging indicator reliably and efficiently. Due to the presence of noise and fading in aerial communications, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may become very low, a condition that renders any detection mechanism a challenging task. There are generally two types of errors associated with paging. A type I error, a false alarm error, is an incorrect paging detection that may cause a false alarm that in turn causes more battery power. A type II error, a miss error, is an incorrect detection that missed a voice/data call. In wireless communication systems, the detection mechanism has to be designed such that false alarms are minimized without exponentially increasing the miss rate.<br>
A single-stage detection mechanism is disclosed in prior art references wherein one threshold is set for a given false alarm and is to maximize the detection probability. See more in "Fundamentals of Statistical Signal Processing: Detection Theory", Prentice Hall PTR, 1st Edition, March 1993. However, because only a single threshold is used while the channel gain ratio is changing, the mechanism cannot feasibly minimize the false alarm and miss rate simultaneously for multi-stage paging indicator detection. Other prior methods, while addressing some of the aforementioned issues, are not efficient in a multi-stage detection of paging indicators.<br>
Existing paging detection methods don't utilize the known Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) information to enhance the detection performance. In fact, most of the designs are usually made for dealing with the worst-case scenario. For example, if<br><br><br><br><br>
-4-<br><br>
the design was to maintain the false alarm probability constant over the operating ranges, the missed detection probability will be virtually zero at high SNR. Even if it is possible to lower the false alarm probability to a number that is lower than the designed target, practically without sacrificing the missed detection probability at high SNR, existing methods don't have ways to use different thresholds to change detection performance since existing methods use a fixed threshold regardless of the SNR.<br>
Without an efficient detection mechanism, either more battery power is consumed, or a high miss rate is inevitable, thereby giving a poor communication performance. As such, there exists a need for improving existing methods for detecting paging indicators.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In view of the foregoing, the following provides a method for detecting a paging indicator in a wireless communication system.<br>
A method and system is disclosed for detecting paging indicators using a multi-stage and multi-threshold detection mechanism so that a mobile terminal can be removed from an idle mode appropriately. After receiving a first paging indicator, it is determined whether a first indicator metric corresponding to the first paging indicator is between a first and a second predetermined thresholds. If it is, a second indicator metric is derived based on a second paging indicator, and a predetermined function of the first and second paging indicator metrics is compared against a third predetermined threshold, wherein the first and second predetermined thresholds are based on a square root of a signal-to-noise ratio of the<br>
-5-<br><br>
first paging indicator, and the third predetermined threshold is based on a square root of a signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to the second paging indicator.<br>
The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
The following will provide a detailed description of a method and system for determining the presence of an indicator carried on a quick paging channel in a wireless communications network. The subject matter set forth herein is applicable to wireless communication systems that multiplex signals using techniques of time<br><br>
-6-<br><br>
division multiplexing (TDM), code division multiplexing (CDM), and frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For explanation purposes, a CDMA2000 system is used as one example. In a wireless communications system such as a CDMA2000 system, several paging indicators are implemented. A paging indicator is understood by those skilled in the art to be a signal for detecting the presence of a paging signal, and to be broadly defined to include but not limited to the following paging indicator examples. For example, a quick paging channel paging indicator is designed for the quick paging channel (QPCH). Another quick paging channel configuration change indicator is designed for the common control channel (CCCH). Yet another quick paging channel broadcast indicator is designed for the broadcast control channel (BCCCH).<br>
The present invention estimates the SNR of the QPCH and computes detection thresholds based on the estimated SNR. The operating range in SNR is divided into two ranges: the high SNR and low SNR ranges. For each range, different decision mechanism is used with SNR dependent thresholds. For example, in the high SNR range, it is possible to meet both the target missed detection probability and the target false alarm probability with a single threshold since the signal quality is good. In fact, having a high SNR range enables the detector to tailor the detection performance between the missed detection probability and the false alarm probability with a single SNR dependent threshold. More specifically, a binary decision mechanism is used in the high SNR range. In the low SNR range, it is not possible to meet both the target missed detection probability and the target false alarm probability with a single threshold.   It is therefore necessary to use two thresholds and this introduces an erasure or undetermined state. When a first paging indicator falls into this erasure state, the subsequent paging indicator is<br>
-7-<br><br>
tested for detection, possibly combined with the first indicator.   Thus a ternary decision mechanism is used within the low SNR range.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, in each paging slot cycle in a CDMA2000 system, two paging indicators, II and 12, are transmitted, wherein 12 is a temporal diversity counterpart of II. In one example, the two paging indicators are spaced apart in time by approximately 20 milliseconds in a CDMA2000 communication system. [khhsiehi]These two indicators span over the channel coherence length (about 20ms) to gain temporal diversity. Assuming that the received symbol signal is expressed as n,k,i, where i is the paging indicator index (1 or 2 for II or 12, respectively), k is the index of the multi-path including diversity branch, and I is the quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) symbol index, where QPSK is understood to be a digital frequency modulation technique for sending digital data over a communication channel, its corresponding estimated radio channel information is a\,u, which represents the channel condition. Measurement metrics corresponding to the paging indicators can then be obtained through a predetermined combining method. For example, through a simple pilot weighted combining methodology, three normalized measurement metrics (or paging indicator metrics) xi, xi and X3 are denoted as:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
-8-<br><br><br><br>
3)<br>
where K2, K2 are respectively the number of multi-paths (including diversity branches) for II and 12, L is the number of QPSK symbols per paging indicator, QPR is a ratio between the powers of the quick paging indicator and a pilot signal and also known as the channel gain informed by the base station. In CDMA2000 systems, QPR has a mathematical representation of <br><br>
indicator modulation symbol power level relative to that of the forward pilot channel, which is also defined in CDMA2000 standard.<br>
It is understood that to derive the measurement metrics based on channel gain informed by the base station and the estimated radio channel information provides a significant advantage over the prior art reference. The above described method may be referred to as a pilot weight combining method. Using this method, no explicit noise reduction weights are designed to address the noise issue as the effect of the weighting is already achieved. As it is shown, since the x\, X2 and x?, are all a function of and normalized over QPR, there is an inherent adaptive mechanism built in that can work with any communications systems. The summations corresponding to the radio channel information represented by the above equations provides one normalization process so that the analysis can be simplified. It is also understood that the measurement metrics do not have to be normalized, and in fact, the consideration of QPR can be done while determining thresholds that the measurement metrics are going to be compared against (which will be further<br>
-9-<br><br>
explained below).   By integrating the considerations of QPR and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the derivation and analysis of these measurement metrics and their corresponding thresholds, both the channel condition and channel configuration are factored in so that the paging detection can be very adaptive to various communication environments.<br>
In another embodiment, wherein a maximal ratio combining methodology is used, three similar normalized indicator metrics xi, X2 and X3 are given as follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
3')<br><br><br><br><br>
where a]ki is the noise variance for the z'th paging indicator, the /cth multi-path, and<br>
the /th symbol. In this method to derive xi, xi and X3, the noise is factored in and the weighting applied is also appropriately considered. In general, if the noise is higher,<br>
-10-<br><br>
the weighting applied should be lower. As seen from the matrix above, the noise variances are placed in the denominator portions to indicate the "reverse proportionate" relation. In this maximum ratio combining method, specific weights are applied as explained above to reduce the noise interference, thereby improving the performance of the system.<br>
The effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the paging indicators II and 12 are referred to as SNRl and SNR2, respectively. SNR3 is defined to be the combined SNR for II and 12. In communication systems, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the SNR is often determined depending on the characteristics of the mobile terminal demodulator, channel condition, and intrinsic noise. For the purpose of this application SNR are used interchangeably with Eb/Nt, which is the ratio of the energy per bit to the effective noise spectral density, since the QPCH power is known in advance based on the pilot channel power.<br>
Any decision rule for the determination of paging indicators requires some form of SNR estimation. For example, SNR can be estimated from the pilot signal. The total received power-to-interference ratio, Ecp/Io, expressed in dB, wherein Ecp and Io are the pilot chip energy and the total received input power spectral density including both signal and interference, respectively. This ratio is readily obtained from the mobile terminal searcher. The noise factor represented by SNR is then given by:<br>
SNR=QPCH_Ec/Ioc=(QPR)2*Ecp/Io   (Eq. 4)<br>
where Ecp and Ioc are the chip energy for the pilot signal and the power spectral density of a band-limited white noise and interference from other cells including multi-path interferences. QPCH_Ec is the total chip energy for the paging indicator.<br>
-11-<br><br>
Since /„ = /„, + Ioc, an approximation Ioc = \ I0 can be obtained for the bad radio channel condition where Ior =1 oc, where the term lor is the post-channel transmitted power spectral density. In the forward link, lor is the total transmitted power spectral density for base station(s) in soft hand off.  The ratio lor/Ioc is called geometry in CDMA2000 systems.<br>
Therefore, the SNR approximations for II and 12 are as follows:<br>
SNRl=2R*(QPR)2*Ecpi/Ioi (Eq. 5)<br>
SNR2=2R*(QPR)2*Ecp2/Io2 (Eq. 6)<br>
The SNR approximation for the combined II and 12 are as follows:<br>
SNR3=2R*(QPR)2*[ Ecpi/Ioi + Ecp2/Io2 ]   (Eq. 7)<br>
where R = 256 or 512 for quick paging channel data rate of 4,800 bps or 2,400 bps, respectively, for the CDMA2000 system. The approximation error is about zero when the signal equals to noise plus interference. The estimation is relatively accurate when the geometry (Ior/Ioc)is low (e.g., from -5dB to 5 dB), which corresponds to a low SNR region and matters mostly in terms of detection and decoding. In the decision rule discussed below, the decision thresholds are constant at a high SNR region, which corresponds to a high geometry.<br>
The estimated indicator SNR is compared against an SNR threshold that determines the boundary between the high SNR and low SNR ranges. The SNR threshold is the SNR at which both the target false alarm probability and the target missed detection probability can be met in the first indicator detection. The SNR threshold that divides the SNR range into high or low SNR is obtained for the given<br>
-12-<br><br>
false alarm probability (PF) and the missed detection probability (PMD) by solving the following joint equations:<br><br><br><br><br>
where "T" is the threshold and x is the indicator. In essence, T can be derived from a<br>
predetermined false alarm probability and the SNR in the above equation is derived<br>
based on both T and a predetermined missed detection probability.   As such, the<br>
threshold is SNR dependant.<br>
Fig. 1 is a graphic representation for showing selection regions for the high SNR range according to one example of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the SNR dependent thresholds can be expressed by a function of the square root of the indicator SNR (which is the horizontal axis). If thresholds are expressed in a linear function, the desired detection performance is obtained by adjusting the slopes and the intercepts of the thresholds. In the high SNR range, only one detection threshold is needed. The threshold (Tf) meeting the given false alarm probability is constant (as shown by the dash line) regardless of the SNR while the threshold (Td) meeting the given missed detection probability is a linear function of the square root of SNR (as shown by the solid line). A detection threshold within the high SNR range can be viewed as a non-decreasing function of the square root of SNR in the region between Tf and Td beyond the intersection of Tf and Td toward the right. For illustration, this particular region is shaded to show where any detection threshold for high SNR can fit in.<br>
-13-<br><br>
When in the low SNR range, the detection is a multiple stage detection mechanism in which at least two quick paging indicators are detected in a combined way. There will be two thresholds Ti and T2 for detecting the paging indicator based on the SNR, but will have a third threshold T3 for detection based on the combined paging indicators. Ti indicates a boundary for tolerating a missed call while T2 indicates a boundary for tolerating a false alarm. According to one example of the present invention, the detection thresholds determination within the low SNR range can be selected as:<br><br><br><br>
f is a non-decreasing function.<br>
If the threshold T3 is expressed as a linear function, T3 can be shown as:<br><br>
wherein the SNR range of (Es/Nt)l is divided into several regions with a3 and h? are pre-computed and saved in memory for given regions.<br>
FIG. 2 provides a flow chart 100 illustrating an improved detection process according to one embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 2, xi and X2are the first and second indicator detection metrics, and X12 is the combined indicator metric (X12 = wl*xi + w2*X2 with wl and w2 being selective weights). (Es/Nt)i is the first indicator symbol energy to noise ratio and (Es/Nt)2 is the second indicator symbol energy to noise ratio. SNR_threshold is the overall SNR threshold, and Ti, T2, T3 are<br>
-14-<br><br>
three thresholds as discussed above, ai, a2, a3 are constants representing the slopes of the linear function and bi, b2, h? indicates the intercepts between Tf and Td.<br>
The flow chart 100 starts in a first stage by going through a decision step 102. If the overall SNR of the QPCH (i.e., QPCH(Es/Nt)) is no less than the predetermined overall SNR based threshold SNR_threshold, the values of Ti and T2 will be set as the same, and mathematically will be determined in step 104 as:<br><br>
On the other hand, if the overall SNR of the QPCH (i.e., QPCH(Es/Nt)) is no less than the predetermined overall SNR based threshold SNR_threshold, Ti and T2 are set at different values in step 106, and mathematically is determined as follows:<br><br>
It can be seen that, although still only based on the first indicator, the Ti and T2 are set at different values based on the different weight constant a and b.   With Ti and T2 set initially, the process move on to step 108 in which the first indicator detection metric xl is compared against the set Ti, and if it is smaller than Ti, the mobile terminal should stay in idle (step 110). If it is determined that the first indicator detection metric xl is larger than Ti in step 108, it is further determined whether the first indicator detection metric x1 is larger than or equal to T2 in step 112. If it is, there is a strong indication that the mobile terminal should be turned on in step 114. This means that if the first indicator detection metric xl is larger than both Ti and T2, it is unlikely that it is a false alarm.<br>
-15-<br><br>
In the event that xi is between Ti and T2, the second detection indicator metric xi is introduced for further detection. The second detection indicator metric X2 is derived from the second paging indicator 12, which may be a temporal counterpart of the first paging indicator II. A combined threshold T3 is derived first based on the square root of the SNR of the second paging indicator. That is,<br><br>
wherein a$ and bz are all predetermined constants that can be stored in the mobile terminal first. A selected non-decreasing function/with xi and X2 as its variables is then compared against T3 in step 116. If it is determined in step 116 that it is below the threshold T3, the mobile terminal is turned off. Otherwise, it will be turned on in step 120. At this point, the two staged indicator detection process is completed.<br>
It is noticed that in step 102, the SNR_threshold is a artificial dividing line that carve the operating range of the SNR into the high SNR and low SNR ranges. As stated above, if it is in the high SNR range, a single threshold suffices to serve the satisfaction of both the target missed detection probability and the target false alarm probability. On the other hand, if it is below that overall threshold, it is deemed to be in the low SNR range, and the ternary decision process is employed. The two different thresholds Ti and T2 introduce an erasure state in which xi is larger than Ti, but smaller than T2. At this point, it is warranted that a further determination should be introduced as seen in step 116 above that a second indicator is used to further decide whether the mobile terminal should be turned on. It is further noticed that the values of Ti, T2, and T3 are all somewhat based on the square root of the SNRs of the respective paging indicators.<br>
-16-<br><br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a hardware schematic 300 that has various components to achieve the paging indicator detection. There is a signal receiver or detector 302 in the mobile terminal that will receive the QPCH signals as well as other signal from other communication channels such as the pilot channel. At least one comparator module 304 is located in the mobile terminal that will perform the multiple rounds of comparison as stated above. An SNR calculator 306 will provide SNR value based on the received signals, and a threshold generator 308 will perform the processing for calculating the thresholds needed. When the SNR and thresholds are fed into the comparator based on the detected signals, the comparator performs the comparison in coordination of a processing unit such as a microcontroller 310. Based on the comparison result, the controller 310 provides a decision signal for the mobile terminal to wake up or stay idle.   It is further understood that the various calculators, generators can be implemented either in hardware or software means. For example, all the processing power can be provided by a microprocessor such as a controller in the mobile terminal without separating into different units. Alternatively, certain modules can be implemented by separate hardware modules that are operated independently from the controller.<br>
