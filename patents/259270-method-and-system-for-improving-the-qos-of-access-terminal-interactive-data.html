				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communication, and particularly to a<br>
method and a system for improving QoS of AT (access terminal) interactive data.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
At present, many communication systems support high-speed transmission of<br>
wireless data services, such as CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) 2000 lxEV-DO<br>
(Evolution Data Only) system. During high-speed transmission of a data service, for a single<br>
AT, the maximum rate of forward transmission that can be reached is 2.4Mbps, and the<br>
maximum rate of reverse transmission that can be reached by an AT is 153.6kbps. However,<br>
the CDMA2000 system is a self-interference system with limited capacity. When the forward<br>
transmission is performed, multiple ATs using the same sector carrier share and compete for<br>
the forward bandwidth of 2.4Mbps. When the reverse transmission is performed, because the<br>
total bandwidth of a sector carrier is only 400k, if the number of ATs is large, the reverse load<br>
will rise, which leads to competition between the ATs and power increasing. Hence, both the<br>
total throughput of the sector and the throughput of each AT will be reduced, and the Quality<br>
of Service (QoS) for the ATs cannot be ensured.<br>
From the purpose of the ATs employing wireless data service transmission, the<br>
demands of the ATs are hierarchical. The demands of some ATs are not very high. For example,<br>
chatting on QQ demands a very low rate, sending e-mails demands a higher rate than the rate<br>
of QQ but does not necessarily has demand on real-time and real-time wireless video service,<br>
demands a very high rate. Therefore, and operator needs to have the ability to provide<br>
hierarchical inter-user QoS service to meet the various AT demands. While satisfying the<br>
demands of ATs, the operator can also improves operating outcome by charging according to<br>
levels, for example, the highest rate is provided for a VIP; a middle rate is provided for a<br>
high-level AT; and a basic rate is provided for a common AT.<br>
The prior art provides a technical solution for implementing forward inter-user QoS<br>
as follows.<br>
2<br><br>
The forward channel of CDMA2000 lx EV-DO is a time-division system, in which<br>
an Access Network (AN) provides a real-time scheduling module for deciding when and for<br>
how long each AT will obtain the service according to some factors such as requested rate,<br>
historical throughput and AT function. Shares of the service obtained by different ATs can be<br>
adjusted in real time by means of the AT function. The higher the level of the AT is, the larger<br>
the share is, the more the chances to be scheduled can be obtained, and the higher the rate is.<br>
In the prior art, only forward inter-user QoS can be realized. The priority or level of<br>
an AT can not be considered in the reverse direction, e.g., corresponding reverse highest rates<br>
and reverse average rates cannot be provided for ATs of different levels. So, in the reverse<br>
direction, when the ATs are not many and the system capacity has not been saturated, the<br>
service demand of each AT can be satisfied; once the reverse load is relatively high,<br>
competition will occur among the ATs, leading to a widely decreasing of the reverse rate of<br>
each AT. The ATs closer to the base station are more competitive than that far away from the<br>
base station, but the high-speed service demands of some ATs cannot be satisfied.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides a method for improving the QoS of the AT<br>
interactive data, including adjusting the transmission rate of the ATs by setting corresponding<br>
reverse attribute parameters of inter-user QoS such as reverse transition probability matrix<br>
and/or maximum rate limit etc. for ATs of different QoS levels, thereby the object of<br>
improving the QoS of the AT reverse data is achieved.<br>
QoS levels of ATs are generally partitioned by operators according to the demands<br>
of their service operating. For example, the ATs can be divided into three classes according to<br>
the QoS levels: VIP ATs, high-priority ATs and common ATs. Of course the classification is<br>
not limited to this. An AT registers the QoS level he/she demands when the account of the AT<br>
is established.<br>
Take the above-mentioned classification result for example, as shown in Fig.l, a<br>
first embodiment provided by the present invention includes:<br>
9<br><br>
Block S101, a reverse maximum rate limit is set for the AT and a corresponding<br>
attribute parameter of reverse transition probability matrix is set for the AT according to the<br>
QoS level of the AT.<br>
For the reverse transmission rate, possible rate levels are 9.6kbps, 19.2kbps,<br>
38.4kbps, 76.8kbps and 153.6kbps.<br>
Considering the possible rate levels, when the corresponding attribute parameter of<br>
maximum rate limit is set for the AT, it can be set either to all the ATs in a system uniformly or<br>
to each AT in the system respectively.<br>
Considering the possible rate levels, when setting the corresponding attribute<br>
parameter of reverse transition probability matrix for the AT, possible transition probabilities<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
Transition009k6_019k2<br>
Transition019k2_038k4<br>
Transition038k4_076k8<br>
Transition076k8_153k6<br>
Transition019k2_009k6<br>
Transition038k4_019k2<br>
Transition076k8_038k4<br>
Transition 153k6_076k8<br>
Each attribute parameter in Table 1 is larger than 0 and less than 1, and from the<br>
representation of each attribute parameter it can be seen that two rate levels are identified in<br>
each attribute parameter. For example, 0<transition038k4_019k2 the two rate levels></transition038k4_019k2>
identified in this attribute parameter are respectively 19.2kbps and 38.4kbps. The transition<br>
probability matrix may configured for each AT (Access Terminal).<br>
For example, when dividing the ATs into VIP ATs, high-priority ATs and common<br>
10<br><br>
ATs according to the above-mentioned QoS levels of the ATs, the attribute parameters of<br>
transition probability matrix set for respective levels are shown in Table 2:<br>
Table 2<br><br>
	VIP ATs	high-priority ATs	Common ATs<br>
Transition009k6_019k2	Y11	Y12	Y13<br>
Transition019k2_038k4	Y21	Y22	Y33<br>
Transition038k4_076k8	Y31	Y32	Y33<br>
Transition076k8_153k6	Y41	Y42	Y43<br>
Transition019k2_009k6	Y51	Y52	Y53<br>
Transition038k4_019k2	Y61	Y62	Y63<br>
Transition076k8_038k4	Y71	Y72	Y73<br>
Transition 153k6_076k8	Y81	Y82	Y83<br>
All the data in this table satisfy:<br><br>
From the above-mentioned setting, it can be seen that according to the QoS levels of<br>
the ATs, the AN sets a high attribute parameter of transition probability matrix for an AT of<br>
high QoS level, and sets a low attribute parameter of transition probability matrix for an AT of<br>
low QoS level.<br>
In block S102 of Figure 1, the AT accesses the system by a connection request<br>
message which carries the identity information of the AT.<br>
In block S103, the AN queries the QoS level subscribed by the AT in account<br>
information of the AT according to the identity information; and obtains the corresponding<br>
attribute parameter of transition probability matrix according to the QoS level.<br>
After the above process, the AN is able to adjust the transmission rate of the AT of<br>
11<br><br>
each QoS level based on the attribute parameter, thereby the QoS of the AT interactive reverse<br>
data is improved.<br>
Block S104, the AN notifies the AT to update the transition probability matrix by<br>
negotiating the attribute parameter of rate, such as RateParameterAttribute, and updates the<br>
reverse maximum rate limit using the attribute parameter of maximum rate limit set for the AT<br>
by transmitting a the reverse rate limit message, such as ReverseRateLimit.<br>
Block S105, the AN determines whether the load on the reverse traffic channel is<br>
overloaded according to the total noise received on the reverse channel, if Yes, block S106 is<br>
performed, the AN transmits an indication, such as Reverse Activity Bit, characterized as<br>
overloaded to the Access Terminal of the user, and then block S108 is performed; otherwise,<br>
block S107 is performed, the AN transmits the Reverse Activity Bit characterized as not<br>
overloaded to the AT, and then block S108 is performed.<br>
During block S105, on determining whether the reverse traffic channel is<br>
overloaded according to the total noise received on the reverse direction, the AN transmits the<br>
information regarding whether the reverse traffic channel is overloaded to the AT by<br>
transmitting an indication, such as Reverse Activity Bit RA, where 'RA=1' represents<br>
overloaded and 'RA=0' represents not overloaded.<br>
The RA bit transmitted by the AN is identical to all the ATs in one sector carrier.<br>
Block S108, the AT receives the Reverse Activity Bit, and determines whether the<br>
reverse traffic channel is overloaded according to the characteristic of the Reverse Activity Bit,<br>
if Yes, block S109 is performed; otherwise, block S110 is performed.<br>
The AT demodulates the RA, if the load is overloaded, it indicates that the rate<br>
should be reduced by a certain probability; if the load is not overloaded, it indicates that the<br>
rate should be increased by a certain probability. The RA bit is identical for all the ATs in one<br>
system, but not all of the ATs increase the rates or reduce the rates simultaneously after the AT<br>
receive the RA bit, while each AT determines whether to increase the rate or reduce the rate<br>
finally according to the transition probability matrix.<br>
12<br><br>
Block S109, reducing the reverse transmission rate according to the updated<br>
attribute parameter of transition probability matrix. The specific implementation process may<br>
be:<br>
Firstly, the AT selects an attribute parameter of transition probability according to<br>
the current transmission rate.<br>
Then, the AT compares a random number it generated with the selected attribute<br>
parameter of transition probability, if the random number is less than the transition probability,<br>
the AT reduces the current rate to the transmission rate of the next lower grade described in the<br>
attribute parameter of transition probability matrix; otherwise, keeps the original rate.<br>
Block S110, improving the reverse transmission rate within the range permitted by<br>
the maximum rate limit according to the updated attribute parameter of reverse transition<br>
probability matrix. The specific implementation process may be :<br>
At first, the AT selects an attribute parameter of transition probability according to<br>
the current transmission rate;<br>
Then the AT compares a random number it generated with the selected attribute<br>
parameter of transition probability, if the random number is less than the transition probability,<br>
the AT increases its current rate to the transmission rate of the next higher grade described in<br>
the attribute parameter of transition probability matrix within the range permitted by the<br>
maximum rate limit; otherwise, keeps the original rate.<br>
Now blocks S109 and S110 will be described in detail still taking the attribute<br>
parameters in Table 1 for example:<br>
Assuming the current rate of the AT is 38.4kbps, the attribute parameter of transition<br>
probability is selected as Transition038k4_019k2.<br>
When the AT demodulates the RA bit and finds that the bit indicates reducing the<br>
rate, the AT will generate a random number x, and 0<x when x transition038k4_019k2></x>
the rate of the AT is reduced from 38.4kbps to 19.2bps, otherwise, the original rate is kept.<br>
13<br><br>
When the AT demodulates the RA bit and finds that it indicates increasing the rate,<br>
the AT will generate a random number x, and 0<x when x transition038k4_076k8 the></x>
rate of the AT is improved from 38.4kbps to 76.8kbps within the range permitted by the<br>
maximum rate limit, otherwise, the original rate is kept.<br>

the reverse direction. Here assuming the reverse load is divided into 3 grades, e.g. high-load<br>
status, middle-load status and low-load status. Two thresholds, NoiseThreshl and<br>

bandwidth of the system: sets a high reverse maximum rate limit for the an AT of a high QoS<br>
level, and sets a low reverse maximum rate limit for an AT of a low QoS level;<br>

maximum rate limit by one grade for the AT of the high QoS level, and sets a reverse<br>
maximum rate limit lower than the current maximum rate limit by one grade for the AT of the<br>
low QoS level.<br>

the current transmission rate.<br>
Then, the AT compares a random number it generated with the selected attribute<br>
parameter of transition probability, if the random number is less than the transition probability,<br>

the values of the "reverse inter-user QoS" attribute parameters can also be modified<br>
dynamically according to the demand, and the attribute parameters of maximum rate limit and<br>
transition probability matrix of the ATs demanding different service levels can also be adjusted.<br>

different levels, the difference between the parameters of the ATs with different levels in<br>
Tables 1, 2 and 3 can be made bigger; on the contrary, the difference between the parameters<br>
can be made less.<br>
It can be seen from the embodiments of the present invention, the invention is able<br>
to provide reverse inter-user QoS service for CDMA2000 1XEV-DO system, making the ATs<br>
with different levels enjoy different reverse highest rates and reverse average rates; in each<br>
reverse load statuses, different highest rates are set to facilitate the stability of the system; the<br>
present invention can satisfy demands of different ATs, the ATs with only low-rate demand<br>
may pay less fee and save the spending, while the ATs with high-rate demands may purchase<br>
high-rate services. Therefore, not only the satisfaction degree of the terminal users is improved,<br>
20<br><br>
but also the service categories of the operator is enriched, by which the ATs are attracted by the<br>
operator and the operating income is obtained.<br>

Dated this 23rd day of October 2007<br>
31<br><br>
A method and a system for improving the QoS of AT interactive data, including: by setting<br>
corresponding reverse inter-user QoS attribute parameters of reverse transition probability<br>
matrix and/or maximum rate limit etc. for ATs of different QoS levels, the transmission rate of<br>
the ATs are adjusted, thereby the ATs of different QoS levels are allowed to enjoy different reverse highest rates and reverse average rates, and the QoS of the AT interactive reserve data is improved. This invention can not only meet the demands of different terminal ATs, but also provide a QoS solution of leveled charging service for network operators, satisfying different AT demands and improving operating income at the same time.<br></td>
