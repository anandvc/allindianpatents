				<td>ANTI-SWAY CONTROL OF A CRANE UNDER OPERATOR'S COMMAND<br>
Field Of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to systems and methods for controlling cable suspended, peyload transfer systems. More particularly, this invention relates to anti-sway control systems and methods for a payload undergoing both horizontal trolley and vertical hoisting motions.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Gantry-style cranes are used extensively for the transfer of containers in port operation.  Typically, a crane has two inputs in the form of velocity commands*. These two velocity commands independently control horizontal trolley and vertical hoisting motions of a payload,  Undesirable swaying of a payload at the end of the transfer is one difficulty in accomplishing a transfer movement.  Loading or unloading operations cannot be accomplished when a payload is swaying. Presently, only an experienced operator can efficiently bring the container to a swing-free stop. Other operators must wait for the sway to stop.  Typically, the time spent waiting for the sway to stop, or the<br><br>

various maneuvers to fine position the load. and talco up to one-third of the total transfer time.<br>
Various prior art patents teach sway reduction<br>
systems. these patents relate to different aspects of payload transfer with reduced sway.  For example, several patents describe operation in autonomous mode where system uses the starting and ending positions of the payload to generate the necessary control signals to achieve the payload transfer. Other non-autonomous systems attempt to minimise the amount of payload sway while following the operator's commands for horizontal trolley and vertical hoisting actions.<br>
Autonomous systems are suitable for structured environments where positions of a payload are well identified,  In a typical port environment, a container's position 'depends on the relative positioning of the ship relative to the crane. Therefore, the position of the container is rarely precisely known. In such an environment, a non-autonomous mode of operation is preferred. The present invention relates to such non-autonomous systems.<br>
Several references disclose non-autonomous modes of operation. Many of these references use a fixed-<br><br>
WO 02/070388	PCT/SC02/0OG33<br>
length pendulum model as the basis for their sway reduction method and/or system. Consequently, these strategies do not eliminate sway when the cable length changes during horizontal motion. Several other references handle the effect of changing vertical cable length by using approximations. The present invention uses the full dynamical equation of a crane system without approximation in order to avoid error and to eliminate sway.  In particular, the present invention uses cancellation acceleration for sway control. The computation of a cancellation signal is exact as it is based on the full dynamical equation of the crane model. This is particularly significant during simultaneous trolley and hoist motions.  For the ease of discussion, the angle of sway of the load and the<br>
velocity of sway of the load are shown as 0 and 0, respectively, and the acceleration of the trolley is referred to as X . All control systems use the horizontal acceleration of the trolley as the control for sway.  Hence, horizontal acceleration is also termed the control.<br><br>
WO 02/070388	PCT/SG02/00033<br>

There are two general approaches for sway minimization.  In first approach, the trolley-acceleration is given in the foxm. r=r+k10+k20 or something similar.  Here, the value r is a time function that depends on the desired motion of the trolley.  The use of this approach Introduces additional damping into the system to control sway. The resultant system can be made to have any desirable damping ratio and natural frequency using the<br>
appropriate values of Jt, and kz.<br>
Several-references adopt this first approach. These references differ" in the profile of the motion dependent time function/ r, and the specific procedure by which values of the damping ratios#o ^ and k2, are<br>
determined*  In the U.S. Patent 5,Ji3,_5j&gt;6 to Rushmer, sway angle and-sway angle velocity are estimated using a fixed-length cable model of the crane. Estimates of the sway angle, Q, and the sway an^le velocity, 0, are used together with the input velocity demand from the operator, xrf/ to compute the control<br>

the trolley is of the fona ±d=kfi'rk28-¥k^(xd~-x) where Xd is the desired position of the trolley. The values of i^, k}, and kj are determined experimentally.<br>
This first approach can effectively damp out sway. The approach is based on standard jnechanisra of feedback and is therefore robust against model inaccuracies. The main disadvantage of this approach is its lacfc of intuitive control by the operator. As the trolley<br>
acceleration depends on &amp;*,&amp; and the operator's de^ixed velocity, the motion of the trolley can be unpredictable and counter*intuitive to the operator. As a result, several manuevers may be needed to bring the system to a proper stop. As such, this first approach<br><br>
WO 02/07Q38S	PCT/SGO2/ft0033<br>

is suitable for an unmanned crane In a structuz-ed environment where psyload position is well identified.<br>
A second approach is based on the principle of sway cancellation.  This ±s the mechanism used by roost human operators for sway damping. The basic idea of this approach for a fixed-length pendulum is described in Feedback Control Systems, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1958, by 0.J- Smith.  In a fixed-length pendulum, the sway motion is a nearly sinusoidal time function with a<br>
frequency &amp;, defined by M = *Jgf£ .  Suppose that a short<br>
pulse of horizontal acceleration is applied at time /=0, this pulse will induce a sway oscillation of frequency o.. It is possible to cancel this oscillation using a second short pulse of the same magnitude and duration applied at time t^itlm* After the application of the second pulse, the system will have no sway for the time thereafter.  This method, known as double-pulse control or .cancellation control, gives the shortest possible settling time for a constant length cable. While this method is readily applicable to a fixed-length pendulum, extensions to<br><br>

pendulums with varying cable length extension are not easy.<br>
Several references teach the general approach of, cancellation control,  in U.S. Patent No,* A+JJSGriSZ- -to. Kawashima et ai., it appears that double-pulse control is used in both the acceleration and deceleration phases of the trolley motion. For a specified final trolley location, the timing and magnitude of these pulses are .computed based on a .fixed-length pendulum. One double-pulse is used in each of the acceleration and deceleration phases-  In between these two phasesf the trolley travels at constant velocity and does not sway.  In order for this method to work, the operator must provide the final position of the trolley to accurately determine the timing and magnitude of the pulses.  This system works reasonably well when the cable length is constant during, horizontal motion.<br>
In a.S. Patent. No, ^5,219,420 to KiisJci et al., it appears that the sway angle is measured and a best fit sinusoidal time function is made of the sway motion. With this estimated sinusoidal function/ a cancellation pulse is generated to eliminate sway. The method assumes the presence of only one sinusoidal frequency.<br><br>

^^ such, fch" method In not *£X*CL1VU £oz systems vhi^u the cable length changes during horizontal motion of the trolley.<br>
In D.S. Patent No. 5,960,963 to Habisofen, a digital filter is used for damping oscillation. It appears that components of the input signal close to the crane oscillation frequency are filtered off.  In particular, the filtered output is a simple average of the input signal and the input signal delayed by a one-half period of the load pendulum motion.  Several other filter vexsXo&amp;M based on. linear combinations of input signals with different delays are used- These input signals are computed usinqr the^ constant length .vers4-~©n of the crane equation.<br>
The methods in the above references rely on constant-length pendulum systems for cancellation. The following references review other attempts to extend cancellation control to varying-length cable systems.<br>
In U.S. Patent No- 5,785/191 to Feddema et al-, an inipttlse response filter and a proportional-integral controller is disclosed for the control of the crane under the operator's intmt.  The-impulse filter based on a digital implementation of an inverse dynamics idea<br><br>

In D.S. Patent Not 5,127/533 to VirrkJcumen, an attempt to adapt a control design for a crane having a fixed-length cable to a control design for a crane having a variable-length cable is disclosed-  It is well known that the period of oscillation off a pendulum is proportional to the square root Of the pendulum length.  The reference shows that a control signal applicable for a crane having a fixed cable length, referred to as Z,, can be used for the crane having another cable length, referred to as l^, by a suitable delay.  For example, suppose the control signal is based on a crane design for a fixed length, Z&gt; / and the control signal is applied at a first time/ tx . VirrJcJcumen teaches that the same effect can be achieved on the crane having another fixed length, I? r when, the control signal is applied at time:<br><br><br>
WO 02/970398	PCT/SGO2/OC033<br>
-   10   -<br>
While the method of Virrkkumen is -reasonable for two fixed-length pendulums, it is not accurate for a single pendulum, or a single crane, undergoing a change in cable length.  For example, the hoisting rate of the cable affects the sway angle, and nhis is not accounted for in Virrkkumen-  In addition, there is the uncertainty in the determination of the second cable length, Ij, as the length may be changed continuously during a typical horizontal motion.<br>
In U.S. Patent No. 5,526,946- to Qverton, the basic sway control teaching is an extension of Kavashima and Virrkkumen.  Instead of a fixed double-pulse at the acceleration and deceleration phases, Overton teaches the use of double-pulse whenever there is a change in the velocity input.  For a sequence-of continuously changing velocity ingut, two sequences of pulses are generated.  The first sequence isjsynchronized with the input velocity change. The second sequence is also generated and then stored.  The secon_d,_s_equence corresponds to a second pulse of the double pulse., control method. Each of the signals in the second sequence is applied to the horizontal acceleration of<br><br>
WO 02/070388	PCT/SC02/0O033<br>
-l1the trolley at about one-half of a pendulum period after the signal in the first sequence. Overtcn adapts Virrkkumen in calculating the timing of these signals. This second sequence is processed (or sent as trolley acceleration) at a variable rate proportional to the current length of the cable. The shorter the cable length, the faster the entries of the seguence are sent. out. As Overton is an adaptation of Virrkfcumen, it suffers from similar deficiencies.<br>
The present invention uses double pulse control for sway cancellation. However, the present invention differs from the references above in several significant aspects.  The present invention computes the exact timing and magnitude of a second pulse using the full dynamic equation of the crane system.  The application of this second pulse eliminates sway even during changing cable length. This precise cancellation pulse computation is crucial for proper sway elimination.  The present invention also ensures that physical constraints, in the form of acceleration and velocity limits of the trolley, are never exceeded. The present invention also includes a feedback<br><br>
WO 02/070388	PCT/SG02/90033<br>
-   12   -<br>
mechanism to eliminate sway due to external forces, such as wind load and other external disturbances.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a computer-controlled svstam for the control of sway in a crane-  The present invention uses cancellation pulses for sway control. Sway is incrementally canceled after being induced by prior commands for trolley acceleration. The timing and magnitude of these cancellation pulses are critical components to the effectiveness of the present anti-sway method. The present invention also takes into account the full dynamic effect of the varying Cable length in the computation of these cancellation signals.<br>
Another object of the .present invention is to determine precise cancellation acceleration pulses.  By using a family of ordinary differential equations, the precise cancellation acceleration" pulses are determined.<br>
A further object of the present invention is the operation of the anti-sway system and method within the acceleration and velocity limits of the trolley drive<br><br>
WO 02/870J88	PCT/SG02/00033<br>
- 13 -<br>
system. Sway control can be adversely effected when acceleration saturation or velocity saturation of the trolley drive system occurs.  The present invention includes a system and method to ensure the proper functioning of the anti-sway mechanism within these limits.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an anti-sway controller unit or kit for incorporation into an existing crane system. The anti^sway controller unit is connected between the operator's velocity commands and the existing variable .speed controllers-  This anti-sway controller follows an operator's input commands for both horizontal trolley travel and vertical payload hoisting.  The controller unit can be switched off, if so desired, to restore manual operator control of the crane.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is residual sway eliiaination. Using sensory measurement of the sway the present invention is further enhanced by A feedback mechanism. This feedback mechanism complements the anti-sway controller and eliminates residual sway due to external factors.<br><br>

Referring to Fig. 1, a model of a crane systeni 10 ig shown. Crane system 10 includes a trolley 20 having a hoist (not shown! to adjustably suspend a payload 30. from a cable 40. A sway angle 0 is created between the position of cable 40 at rest and the,position of cable 40 during sway oscillation. A differential<br><br>

For the ease of presentation, these initial conditions are chosen*  It is also possible to extend this derivation for a more general set of initial conditions.<br>
Since the magnitude of sway angle 8(f) is fairly small throughout the ensuing motion, an approximation is possible.  Following the standard engineering practice of assuming that Eta0(/)s0(O and W30Qi)&amp;\, an approxijnation is made.  Thus, the equation of motion is approximated by:<br><br>

equations allows system 50 to handle, in a highly accurate way7 the effect of sway created by operator commands for tijne-varying horizontal trolley position and vertical cable length.<br>
Still looking at FIG- 3, a preferred embodiment of anti-sway system 50 block diagram is shown. An anti-sway controller_60 implements the multiple ODE system using the system described above. Anti-sway controller 60 has two inputs and three outputs. The principal input is an adjusted operator's command acceleration,<br>
a^. Another input providing a measurement signal of cable length 40 arid a time derivative of cable length<br>
40, £(t) and t(f), respectively, is* received from a sensor 70 as needed for the ODE solver.  The principal output is a. cancellation acceleration signal, ac, the<br>
equivalent of correction pulse, ij in equation (8). Two other outputs from anti-sway controller 60 are connected to a prediction module 80 and a feedback module 90, respectively.  The functions of prediction module 80 and feedback module 90 are discussed below.<br>
A pair of saturation and filter components 100f 105 each filter the high frequency components of an<br><br><br>

operator's command horizontal trolley and vertical hoist velocity input signals, VM (see Fig. 3) and Vex. (see Fig. 4), respectively. The input signals_are received from a pair of joysticks (not shown.). Saturation and filter components 100, 105 also set the maximum allowable velocities of the horizontal trolley and the vertical hoist motions, respectively-Referring now to FIG. 4r saturation and filter 105 also converts the vertical velocity input, V^,, into a<br>
cable velocity demand signal, t^.  The cable velocity demand signal, t^ is then sent to a velocity<br>
controller 107 of the existing crane system for the hoisting drive system of the cable.<br>
Looking again at FIG.. 3, a filter component 110 is shown. Filter component 110 reduces a velocity demand signal, referred to as v^-, by one-half to account for<br>
the delayed effect of the cancellation signal, a±. Filter 110 also converts the velocity demand, v^., into corresponding acceleration demand signals, a^, by differentiation.  The velocity demand signal, v^., has two components, a filtered operators command velocity.<br><br>

referred to as vJf  and a compensation signal,  referred to as   v^^.     The compensation  signal component,   v,^,   is<br>
needed to compensate for the discrepancy between the desired velocity of the operator's command velocity, vr/   and a  velocity output signal,   referred to as  v".<br>
This discrepancy arises from the action of-anti-sway controller 60.<br>
The overall anti-sway system 50 output is the<br>
velocity output signal,   v#,   and is sent to an existing velocity controller 112 for the drive system of the trolley 20.     An'output  signal,   va/   is the integral sum,<br>
shown as  115,   of three signals:     the adjusted operator's command acceleration,   o^,  the cancellation<br>
acceleration siqnal,   a,,   and the external factor reduction acceleration,   at.     The acceleration signal, a^f   results from the operator*s command.    The cancellation acceleration signal,   ac,  cancels sway induced by prior adjusted operator's command acceleration a^.    The external factor reduction<br><br>

acceleration signal, a2, reduces sway due to external<br>
factors such as wind load-<br>
Anti-sway system 50 fails to operate properly if the input demand, vrd to the system exceeds the<br>
velocity or acceleration limits on trolley 20. A saturation controller 120 functions as a velocity and acceleration limit to handle this situation. Controller 120 enforces the velocity and acceleration<br>
limits, vthax and dmm respectively, of trolley 20. These limits are usually known, or can. be easily estimated.  Hence, it is necessary to ensure that<br>
|"fc(0|-ym* and fvo(O|^tfw at all times.  Since the signals<br>
for the adjusted operator's command acceleration, the acceleration cancellation, and the external factor<br>
reduction acceleration, a^, aef and ast respectively, are piecewise constant and change only at the sample time hT it follows that the velocity output, vn(i), is piecewise linear and continuous. This is useful for the design of the saturation controller 120,<br>
Continuing to look at Fig. 3, saturation controller 120 receives the following input signals:<br><br><br>
WO G2fl&gt;70388	PCT/SGO2/QQfl33<br>

the acceleration demand reference signal,   a^.,   the cancellation acceleration signal,   ae,   and the external<br>
factor reduction acceleration feedback signalf   aM+ Saturation Controller 120 produces the adjusted . operator's command acceleration,   a^t   as an output signal.     The basic idea is to let;<br><br>
and to choose the value of a constraint factor, referred to as  X,   as close to 1 as possible subject  to the acceleration and velocity constraint limits.     The acceleration and velocity constraints can be stated as:<br>

The output velocity variable v~ refers to the output velocity, *t,-at a previous time, such as vo(kT- 7), while the rest of the variables are all "signals at a current time kT "  These two Constraints can be equivalently stated as;<br><br><br><br>

The objective is to find,an optimal constraint factor, referred to as Xm, which is<br><br>
the optimal X for the following optimization problem ;<br>
subject to the constraints of equation (11). since the optimization problem is for a single variable subject to two constraints, the optimal constraint factor, Xm, can be easily computed. The exact expression for the adjusted operator's command acceleration, aadj, can be shown to be :<br><br><br>
Again looking at Fig. 3 prediction mode! 80 and the connections of the prediction model velocity change component signal, vPm, the estimated velocity of the velocity output signal, vP, and the velocity compensation signal, Vcomp, are arranged   to   create   a   steady-state value of the output velocity signal,  Vo,<br><br>

equal to the steady-state value of the filtered operator's velocity command, v,.  In other words, the<br>
system velocity output, vae is responsive to the<br>
filtered operator's velocity command, v,.  The input of prediction module 80 is the entire collection of ODEs residing in anti-sway_contr_oller-i6Q-at the current tins. A bold arrow from anti-sway controller 60 to prediction model 80 displays this relationship. The output of prediction module 80 is the prediction model velocity change component signal, v^ .  The value of<br>
prediction model velocity change component, v^,, is the<br>

Suppose-there are M ODEs in anti-sway controller €0 at the current time of t = kT and they are represented as a collections^ state vectors [SOAkT)  S$,(krj] for i = l,-.,M.  Prediction module 80 assumes that the length of cable 40 rewaijis unchanged after the current: time, / = *7".  The<br><br>

representing additional future velocity demand-due to the anti-sway controller €0,<br>
Additionally* when the operator's hoisting velocity command becomes zero, the cable length remains constant thereafter. Thus, the constant cable length assumption used in the prediction module 80 is satisixea in tne final phase of the transfer motion. This is all that is needed to eliminate terminal sway.<br><br>

In the above" computation, the prediction module correction acceleration signal, if, is computed using the ODE solver- Assuming a constant length of cable 40, an energy approach is more computational efficient to compute the prediction module correction<br>
acceleration signal, x/*9.  When the length of cable 40 remains unchanged, the crane 10 is a pendulum with constant total energy in a conservative system. Again,<br>
suppose the initial condition is \s^{iT)  5#,(*r&gt;] at a time, t=JiT, the total energy is<br>

Using equation {14), the corresponding prediction module correction acceleration signal, */"/ can be computed from equation (8) with £(F)t*£(kT)*<br>
The estimated velocity signal/ vp/ is the<br>

The configuration of anti-sway system 50 using the various components described above is sufficient to cancel sway induced by the operator's commands in both horizontal and vertical velocity input signals, v<x and vow respectively. sway can also be induced by external factors such ss wind load or lateral ijnpact forces on the payload during loading unloading. however anti-sway controller using cancellation methods system described above does not eliminate caused factors. a feedback module is provided to due resulting from any nonconformity between parameters of model actual physical system.></x><br>

Feedback module 90 generates a feedback external factor reduction acceleration signal, "".  Feedback control law converts the external factor sway angle and the external factor sway angle velocity, &amp;g and &amp;f, respectively, to an extended factor reduction acceleration, represented as Q€*  This conversion can be accomplished in several ways.  In the preferred embodiment, a simple control law_is used. A person having ordinary skill in the art of control, or related discipline, can easily modify or replace this control law using various techniques.  One choice for such a control law is:<br><br><br>
WO02/070388	"33-	PCT/SG02/00033<br>

For an appropriate choice of kCl this control law will damp out sway induced by external factors. If the effect of the external factors is large, the acceleration signal, aCl may cause the trolley to oscillate. Therefore, it is advisable to limit the magnitude of the acceleration signal, ac.<br>
In another modification of the preferred embodiment, the trigonometric approximations that have been made in going from the original system representation of equation (1) of the approximate representation of equation (2) are considered. These approximations can be eliminated if the following transformation is substituted into equation (1):<br><br>

The embodiment as described above is easily modified to control a crane having multiple hoisting cables attached to the payload*  There are several ways of doing this. One way is to change the form of the differential equation to agree with the dynamics of the tnultiple-cable system. Another is to represent the dynamics of a multiple-cable system with the dynamics of an equivalent single-cable system using an appropriate length of the cable.  The equivalent length to be used for the-multi-cable system depends on the arrangement of the cables-  It can be obtained either analytically or via a calibration process on. an actual crane.<br>
A preferred embodiment described above includes a feedback module 90 to handle sway induced by external disturbances- If the operating environment of a crane is such that the external disturbances are negligible, or highly predictable, the invention can be implemented without the feedback module 90 and the associated sway sensor 125.<br><br>
