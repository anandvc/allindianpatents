TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amines including tetrazole represented by following formula 1, method for preparing thereof and pharmaceutical composition containing<br>
them.<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
Wherein, ri, R2, rs, R4, rs, Re/ n, m and * are as defined in the description.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Neurons in the mammalian CNS (central nervous system) are highly sensitive to the availability of oxygen. It is well known that a transient critical reduction of oxygen within the intact brain, triggers a various pathological phenomena, finally a fatal brain damage [K. Nieber, Pharmacol. Ther. 1999, 82, 71]. Oxygen can become<br>
unavailable to the brain through a loss of blood flow (ischemia)  following  cardiac  arrest  or  occlusion  of intracranial vessels by thrombosis and embolism, or through an insufficient oxygen concentration in the blood (hypoxia). Ischemic  cell  injury  may  arise  from  complex interactions  biochemical  cascades,  which  includes disturbances    in    among    electrophysiological, hemodynamical and energy metabolism [W. Paschen and B. Djuricic,   J.   Neurochem.   1995,   65,   1692]   and modifications in synaptic transmission[H. J. Luhmann, Prog. Neurobiol.  1996,  48,  131].  The disturbed ion homeostasis  characterized  by  enhanced  cellular  K+ efflux  and Na+  and Ca2+ influx  is  followed by  a substantial  extracellular  acidosis,   free  radical formation,  cell swelling,  and inhibition of protein synthesis, which are connected with excitatory amino-acid receptor, Ca-dependent or ATP-dependent K-channel, etc.  As explained above,  the ischemic cell damage occurred by a cascade of biochemical events, not by single event. So, several strategies are suggested for the development of neuroprotective agents and it is also suggested that that the effective intervention on several key steps during ischemic cascade is necessary to be an effective therapeutic agent for brain ischemia<br>
[De Keyser  et al. Trends Neurosci., 1999, 22, 535;<br>
Dirnagl  et  al.  Trends  Neurosci.,  1999,  22,  391;<br>
Gladstone et al. Stroke, 2002, 33, 2123] .<br>
Even after blood flow is restored, oxygen can also enhance the biochemical reactions that generate free radicals, which can lead to a potential for "reperfusion injury" to occur. Both acute and chronic injury of tissues and organs are known to be caused by ischemia-reperfusion or by endotoxins via bacterial infection. In order to prevent the brain injury caused by ischemia-reperfusion, the brain must be protected during ischemic period to avoid additional injury and pathological progressive cellular changes have to minimize.<br>
For that purpose, the development of several neuroprotectives such as excitatory amino acid antagonists, anti-oxidants, adenosine agonists and KATP channel openers are being pursued.<br>
Damage or death of neurons is known to be a main cause for various neurological disorders such as stroke, head trauma, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infant asphyxia, glaucoma and daiabetic neuropathy, etc[G. J. Zoppo et al., Drugs 1997, 54, 9: I. Sziraki et al. , Neurosci, 1998, 85, 1101].<br>
Neurons are damaged by various  factors  including<br>
increases in iron concentration, reactive oxygen species, and peroxidants within neurons[M. P. Mattson et al., Methods Cell Biol. 1995, 46, 187; Y. Goodman et al., Brain Res. 1996, 706, 328] .<br>
Free radicals are generated in cells by the oxidative stress. An excess of oxygen free radicals facilitates lipid peroxidation, so that peroxidants are accumulated in neurons and it also causes the change in protein synthesis and DNA. The reactive free radicals accumulated in cells are known to be responsible for a variety of diseases[J. M. McCord, Am J. Med. 2000, 108, 652] . Including inflammatory diseases such as arthritis; atherosclerosis; cardiac infarction; and neurodegenerative disease such as dementia, allergy, cancer as well as acute and chronic injury of tissues and organs.<br>
Therefore, therapeutic approaches to minimize the damage or death of neurons have been pursued, including the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, NO formation, and reactive oxygen species induced by endotoxins. To date, anti-oxidants are reported to ameliorate the neuronal damage and death caused by an increase of iron concentration within neurons. Much effort has been<br>
continued to develop pharmaceutical drugs which are able to prevent neuronal damage by oxidative stress (Y. Zhang et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993, 13, 378).<br>
There are reports that KATP opening is related to the induction of anti-oxidant enzymes [S. Okubo et al., Mol. and cell Biochem. , 1999, 196, 3], and to decrease the release of excitatory amino acid[J-L Moreau, G. Huber, Brain Res., 1999, 31, 65].<br>
Diazoxide, a katp channel opener, has been reported to reversibly oxidize flavoproteins in mitochondria, resulting in inhibition of the formation of oxygen free radicals, which may protect cell injury by oxidative stress [A. A. Starkov, Biosci, Rep. 1997, 17, 273; V. P. Skulachev, Q. Rev. Biophus. 1996, 29, 169].<br>
Infant asphyxia (IA), triggered by transient deficiency of oxygen supply during delivery, was reported to be caused by the reduction of energy production, damage of cell membrane due to oxygen free radical, release of excitatory neurotransmitters, change of intracellular ion concentrations including calcium, zinc, etc. IA is a major worldwide problem, because if IA is severe, the chances of mortality are high(approximately 1/3 of the total infant<br>
mortality).  In addition, it can produce long term sequela such as movement disorders, learning disabilities, epilepsy, dystonia, mental retardation, and spasticity[C. F. Loid et. al. Physiology and Behavior, 2000, 68,  263-269].<br>
Antioxidant enzymes, allopurinol, Vitamine C &amp; E, free radical scavengers, inhibitors of excitatory neurotransmitters, calcium channel blockers such as nimodipine and flunarizine, inhibitors of NO formation, hyperglycemic and hypothermic therapy may be beneficial for the protection of brain injury, but their clinical application is still limited.<br>
Glaucoma, one of the leading causes of blindness, is defined   as   an   optic   neuropathy   associated  with characteristic changes in optic nerve.   In humans,  the optic nerve consists of 1 million axons from neurons whose perikarya reside primarily in the ganglion cell layer and, to a less extent, in the inner part of the inner nuclear layer. The excavated appearance of the optic nerve head in glaucoma  is  thought  to  be  caused  by  the  death  and subsequent loss of ganglion cells and their axons [N.N. Osborne, et. Al. Survey of Ophthalmology, 43; suppl. 1999, S102-S128].<br>
Neuroprotective agents in glaucoma may protect death of retinal neurons,  in particular the ganglion cells, either directly or indirectly.  A variety of agents such as NMDA(N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor antagonist, p-blockers, calcium antagonists,  and antioxidants  can be  used  to protect the death of retinal neurons induced by ischemia and damage of optic nerves.<br>
Although the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy has not been clearly established, two main hypotheses have been proposed for it. One is metabolic abnormalities, and the other is blood flow deficits in peripheral nerve [K. Naka et. Al. Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 1995, 30 153-162]. Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) by stimulating metabolism of lipid and improving impaired nociceptive responses of neurons, and Prosaptide by releasing neutrophic factors are in clinical trials. In addition, Memantine, showing good effects on vascular dementia through the regulation of NMDA receptor, is pursuing clinical trial. Then, neuroprotectlve agents having a variety of mechanisms of action may be developed to treat diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Ischemic  heart  diseases  are  usually  caused  by myocardial   ischemia,   when   the   oxygen   supply   is<br>
significantly decreased compared to the oxygen demand due to the imbalance between them [G. J. Grover, Can. J. Physiol., 1997, 75, 309; G. D. Lopaschuk et al. Science &amp; Medicine, 1997, 42]. Myocardial ischemia triggers various pathophysiological changes progressively that will ultimately lead to irreversible myocardial injury, cell death and tissue necrosis. At a stage where the injury to the cells is reversible, this process can be prevented by early reperfusion of the myocardium. However, there is potential for "reperfusion-injury" to occur [D. J. Hearse, Medicographia, 1996, 18, 22].<br>
To delay the ischemic cascade and to minimize the reperfusion-injury, the use of adenosine agonists, inhibitors of Na^-K"1" antiport, oxygen free radical scavengers and KATP (ATP sensitive potassium channel) openers are investigated as well as ACE (Angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors and calcium antagonists. In addition, global ischemia occurs during cardiac surgery or during heart storage prior to transplantation. Recent studies reported that the addition of katp openers to a hyperkalemic cardioplegic solution, improved the recovery of postischemic contractile function after normothermic or short periods of hypothermic ischemia [D. J. Chambers, D. J. Hearse, Ann. Thoar. Surg., 1999, 68,<br>
I960.]. The use of those compounds as protectants or curatives for the organs related to "ischemia-reperfusion injury" such as retina and skeletal muscles besides heart and brain, in being investigated.<br>
As mentioned above, since ischemic cascades proceed by complex interactions, it may be a useful strategy to develop the compound acting at more than one target site in ischemic cascade.<br>
katp is found in a variety of tissues including cardiac muscle, smooth muscle skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreatic (3-cells, the brain and central nerve system, which makes it attractive as a drug target. However, the same diversity poses a difficulty of finding tissue selective agents.<br>
Differently from conventional potassium channel openers, the benzopyranyl cyanoguanidine compound (BMS-180448) represented by the following formula 4 and benzopyranyl imidazole compound (BMS-191095) represented by the following formula 5, have been reported to show modest antiischemic potency with excellent cardiac selectivity. Although the compound represented by formula 5 had all desirable features to serve as a lead compound, it still<br>
retains some degree of vasorelaxant and hypotensive activities [K. S. Atwal et al. , J. Med. Chem. , 1995, 38, 3236; K. S. Atwal et al., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 40, 24; K. S. Atwal et al., Current Pharmaceutical Design, 1996, 2, 585]. Therefore, more cardioselective compounds which have cardioprotective potency without lowering of blood pressure significantly, still give the prospects for the development of a novel cardioprotectant.<br>

FORMULA 5<br><br>
The ratio of cancer in human diseases is being gradually increased. Angiogenesis, formation of new blood vessels, is recognized as the core process for growth and metastasis of solid tumors (Folkma, J. et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 1992, 267, 10931-10934). Angiogenesis is controlled<br>
by inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis. When the balance between them is broken, that is, when angiogenesis inducers prevail over angiogenesis inhibitors, a large quantity of new blood vessels are formed. Angiogenesis is closely related to various physiological phenomena, such as embryonic development, wound healing, chronic inflammation, hemangiomas, diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, AIDS complications, and the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors (Forkman, J., Klagsbrun. M. Science, 1987, 235, 442-447). Angiogenesis includes a series of processes such as the migration, proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells, and is an important prerequisite for the growth and metastasis of cancers. In detail, because the growing tumor cells require the formation of blood vessels from host cells, angiogenesis promoters derived from tumors stimulate to induce the angiogenesis into the tumor mass. Afterwards, the blood vessels formed around the malignant tumors facilitate to metastasize the tumor cells to other sites. Therefore, the inhibition of angiogenesis leads to the prevention of the growth and metastasis of cancers. As one of the important research areas for the developing of anti-cancer drugs, extensive attention is paid to the finding of angiogenesis inducers and angiogenesis inhibitors, and the<br>
revealing of their working mechanisms.<br>
Thus far, proteins such as prostamine and tumor necrotic factors, factors derived from cartilage tissues, and cortisone called angiostatic steroids and various steroid derivatives, have been found to be able to play roles as angiogenesis inhibitors. In particular, hydrocortisone exhibits anti-angiogenetic activity by cotreatment with heparin (Lee, A. et al., Science, 1983, 221, 1185-1187; Crum, R. et al. , Science, 1985, 230, 1375-1378). However, these compounds have a potential problem to treat cancers effectively owing to their cytotoxicity.<br>

The experiment confirming the pharmacological effect of the compounds of formula 1 according to the present invention was accomplished in the below.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE  1&gt; Vasodilating effect  on blood vessel excised from rats<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of formula 1 according to the present invention have the vasodilating effect on blood vessel was accomplished in the below.<br>
Rats(350 ~  450 g,  obtained from the Experimental<br>
Animal Team of the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology)were knocked to be unconscious by hitting the occipital region, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and underwent thoracotomy. After being quickly removed, the thoracic aorta was deprived of the adipose tissue and cut into aortic rings of 3 mm width. The aorta was lightly rubbed with cotton club soaked in a modified Krebs Henseleit buffer (Physiological salt solution) to remove the inner epithelial layer therefrom. While being hung in an organ bath containing a physiological buffer, the vascular smooth muscle was allowed to equilibrate under a<br>
resting tension of 2g and then, stand for 1 hour at 37°C for stabilization, supplying a carbogen consisting of 95%<br>
02 ~ 5% C02.<br>
Thereafter, the vascular smooth muscle was constricted with 1CT5M phenylephrine and washed several times with physiological saline solution. The said procedure was repeated again to ensure the stable reactivity of vascular smooth muscle to repetitive constriction/relaxation.<br>
Thereafter, 3 x 10~6 M methoxamine was applied to induce an intensive constriction in the vascular smooth muscle. When the vasoconstriction induced by the methoxamine was reached and maintained to a maximum, test compounds and control material was cumulatively added to<br>
the organ bath in concentration of 1, 3, 10 and 30 \i M,<br>
respectively, to examine the vasodilating effect. Cromakalim, BMS-180448(the compound of formula 4) and BMS-191095 (the compound of formula 5), known to be the first generation KATP opener with potent vasodilating effect were used as control materials.<br>
The change rate of constriction by the addition of the drugs compared to the maximal constriction induced by methoxamine was calculated to plot a concentration-<br>
relaxation response curve. Through a least linear regression analysis, IC50 that the drug concentration at which the vascular tissue is relaxed to 50% extent of the maximal constriction, was obtained for each drug. The results are shown in table 2, below.<br>

As shown in the above table 2, Cromakalim represented a potent vasorelaxation effect having 0.067 |UM of ICso on the isolated rat aorta constricted with methoxamine (3 |OM) while IC50s of BMS-180448 and BMS-191095 were 1.38 ^M and 2.14 jxM, respectively, showing twenty and thirty times weaker vasorelaxation effects than that of Cromakalim. On the other hand, the compounds of the present invention ranged, in IC5o, from 5.59 ^M to greater than 30 ^M, so that their vasorelaxation effects were significantly weaker than those of the controls, Cromakalim, BMS-180448 and BMS-191095.<br>
When exerting their actions on the KATP present in the heart, the compounds according to the present invention play a role in protecting the heart. On the other hand, the KATP openers acting on the KATP present in peripheral vascular smooth muscle dilate the blood vessels, lowering the blood pressure. Hypotension may mask any cardioprotective effects due to reduction in coronary artery perfusion pressure, and would limit utility in treating myocardial ischemia. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention may be more optimal for<br>
cardioprotectives by virtue of their weak vasorelaxation<br>
activity.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2&gt; Protective effect on iron-induced neuronal cells<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of formula 1 according to the present invention suppress the iron-induced neuronal cells was accomplished in the below.<br>
From the brains of 17 ~ 18 day-old embryos, cortical neuron cells were isolated and then, cultured at 37°C for 7<br>
~  9 days in a 5% CC&gt;2 incubator. The said cortical cell<br>
cultures were washed twice with MEM(Minimum essential medium) to reduce the serum level to 0.2%. Test compounds were serially diluted four times to make the final<br>
concentration of 30, 7.5, 1.875 and 0.469 \i M, respectively.<br>
Then, the compound of the said concentration was pre-treated for 30 min, respectively. For the experiment, test compound was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in a medium. At this time, the final concentration of DMSO was not allowed to exceed 0.1%. For control group, only vehicle was applied.<br>
After the said pre-treatment, FeS04 was added to the<br>
medium for a final concentration to be 50 [i M. The medium<br>
was cultured in C02 incubator for 24 hours. During the incubation, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) was released by iron. The serum level of lactate dehydrogenase released into the medium was measured to assess necrosis of neuronal cell by the oxidative toxicity of iron. The protective effect on neuron cells of the test compounds was evaluated by calculating the LDH reduction rate of treatment-group compared with that of the control group. The concentration-protective effect curve was generated and IC5o value, drug concentration producing 50% of the maximal effect, was calculated from a least linear regression analysis. The results are shown in table 3, below.<br>

As shown in table 3, the compounds of the present invention had the protective effect on iron-induced neuronal cell injury. Preferably, ICso of the compounds prepared in example 11, 17, 31, 32, 54 ,59, 61, 70, 75, 77,<br>
79, 81, 82 and 85 were below 2 ^ M. More preferably, IC50 of the compounds prepared in example 60 and 71 were below 1 \t, M. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention had<br>
the strong protective effect on iron-induced neuronal cell injury.<br>
Since  benzopyran  derivatives   substituted  with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had a strong protective effect on iron-induced neuron toxicity, they can be used as agents for prevention or treatment of the neurological disorders caused by the neuronal injury, such as cerebral stroke and dementia as well as inflammatory disease such as arthritis, cardiac infarction, and acute /chronic tissue damage (S.

The same procedure as example 2 was accomplished, except for that concentration of test compound was added to<br>
be 30 fi M, and the final concentration of hydrogen peroxide<br>
was 30 [.i M. The result was shown in table 4.<br>

As shown in the above,  the reference compound of formula 5(BMS-191095) exerted a protective effect (27%) at<br>
concentration of 30 \i M. However, the compound of formula<br>
11 according to the present invention had a high inhibitory rate (96%). Therefore, benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had the similar protective effect to common antioxidants such as propyl gallate and promethazine. Also, the compounds of the present invention had a strong protective effect on neuron cells to the hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal toxicity, they can be used as a therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of the neurological disorders caused by oxidative stress-induced neuronal ' death, the hydrogen peroxide-induced damage or necrosis of neurons, such as cerebral stroke and dementia as well as inflammatory disease such as arthritis, cardiac infarction, and acute/chronic tissue damage(S.

McCord, The Evolution of Free Radicals and Oxidative Stress. Am J Med, 2000, 108, 652-659) .<br><experimetal example> Inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation by iron<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compound of formula 1 according to the present invention suppresses the iron-induced lipid peroxidation was accomplished in the below.<br>
The rat brain was homogenized in a Krebs buffer(15 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 140 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KC1, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 1.4 mM KH2P04, 0.7 mM MgCl2, PH 7.4) and the supernatant separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min was used for further experiments. FeCl2 was added for the final<br>
concentration to be 400 \i M. Then the brain homogenate was<br>
allowed to stand at 37 °C for 30 min for the facilitation of oxidation. Each of the test compounds was added at a concentration of 100 \i M. For control group, only vehicle<br>
was applied.<br>
Iron facilitates the oxidation of the said brain homogenate to produce malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation product. Thus, the lipid peroxidation was determined by MDA quantification. The inhibitory effect<br>
against lipid peroxidation of the test compounds was evaluated by calculating MDA reduction rate of the test compounds compared with that of the control group.<br>
Typically, the MDA quantification is achieved by reacting samples with 2-thiobarbituric acid(TEA) and measuring the absorbance at 530 nm. However, this method is unsuitable to treat samples on a large scale because of a boiling step. Thus, in this experiment, N-methyl-2-phenylindole was used instead of TEA. In this case, one molecule of MDA reacts with two molecules of N-methyl-2-phenylindole to form a chromagen which shows a maximal absorbance at 586 nm and requires no boiling steps. BioxytechR LPO-586 Kit was used for MDA quantification. The result was shown in table 5, below.<br>

As shown in the above, the compounds prepared in ex ample 10, 11, 22, 24, 26, 34, 57, 70, 71, 83, 85 and 108 had very potent inhibitory effect against the iron-induced lipid peroxidation with higher than 90% of inhibitory effect. Also, the compounds prepared in example 11, 17, 32, 54, 59, 60, 61, 70, 71, 81 and 85 had simultaneously inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation as well as protective effect on oxidative stress induced neuronal injury by iron or copper (table 3 and 4) . Therefore, the compounds of the present invention can be used as a therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of the<br>
neurological disorders caused by the accumulation of oxidation product with facilitation of lipid peroxidation, such as cerebral stroke and dementia as well as inflammatory disease such as arthritis, cardiac infarction, and acute /chronic tissue damage (Chul Lee, Antioxidant ability of caffein and its metabolites based on the study of oxygen radical absorbing capacity and inhibition of LDL peroxidation.

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 5&gt; Inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation induced by copper<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of formula 1 according to the present invention suppress the copper-induced low density lipoprotein(LDL) oxidation was accomplished in the below.<br>
Low density lipoprotein of human(human LDL, sigma) was dissolved in water to be final concentration of 1 mg/ml. To remove EDTA(ethylenediamine tetraacetate), the aqueous<br>
solution was dialyzed in phosphate buffer at 4°C  for 18<br>
hours. At this dialysis, phosphate buffer was changed three times. Phosphate buffer was added to LDL (100 [i g LDL protein/ml) which EDTA was removed from the aqueous solution, additionally thereto CuS04 10 ^i M as oxidant was<br>
added. Thus, the final concentration of tocopherol for test compounds and control material was 10~9, 10~7 and 10~5 M, respectively. Group to which CuSC&gt;4 was not added was used as blank group. Group to which CuSC^ and vehicle were added in place of test compounds was used as control group. The<br>
mixture was incubated at 37°C for 18 hours. EDTA 200 ^ M was<br>
added to the mixture to terminate the oxidation reaction.<br>
As shown in example 4, Cu2+ facilitates the oxidation reaction to produce malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation product. The MDA quantification is achieved by reacting samples with 2-thiobarbituric acid(TEA) and measuring the absorbance at 530 nm. Also, 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane purchased from sigma was used as standard materials. Inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation of the test compounds was measured by MDA(nmol) to protein(mg). Decrease of MDA to that of control group was calculated. The result was shown in table 6, below.<br>

As shown in table 6, the compound of formula 11 of the present invention had significant inhibitory effect against lipid peroxidation induced by copper depending upon the concentration of the compounds. Also, the compound of the present invention had inhibitory effect twice as much as that of tocopherol(reference compound) at a concentration of 1(T5M. Also, the compound of the present invention had inhibitory effect similar to that of probucol.<br>
Since benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had very potent inhibitory effect against the copper-induced lipid peroxidation, they can be used as an agent for prevention or treatment of the<br>
the experiment. A7r5(Rat thoracic aorta smooth muscle cell line, ATCC), as smooth muscle cell was incubated in DMEM(Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) containing 10% of FBS(fetal bovine serum). Thereafter, the cell was incubated in 48 well plate for two days, then was incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours to use for experiment. Krebs-linger buffer (Krebs-Ringer(K-R), 99.01 mM NaCl, 4.69 mM KC1, 1.87 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM. MgS04, 1.03 mM K2HP04, 25 mM NaHC03, 20 mM Hepes, 11.1 mM D-glucose, pH 7.4) was used for washing and process of cell monolayers. After cell monolayers media was<br>
removed, each of test compounds (0.2 D ) was pre-treated to media, then incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Final<br>
concentration was 50 \i M, hydrogen peroxide was added. The<br>
media was allowed to stand for 30 min. The said solution from media was removed. The media was washed one time.<br>
H2DCFDA 20 [i M was added to the media.  The media was<br>
allowed to stand for 30 min. the media was washed two times. Thereafter,   oxidation  of  H2DCFDA  was  measured  by Fluorescence reader  (FL600,  Biotech Instruments,  485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission). The result was shown in table 7.<br>

If hydrogen peroxide was added to A7r5 cells, cell damage was induced by reactive oxygen species, which led to the increase in DCF fluorescence. However, the increase in DCF fluorescence induced by hydrogen peroxide was inhibited by treatment of the compound of formula 11 of the present invention, in a dose dependent manner. Most preferably, DCF fluorescence was completely inhibited by treatment of 30<br>
j-i M.  Since the compound of formula 11 of the present<br>
invention had potent inhibitory effect against reactive oxygen species accumulation induced by hydrogen peroxide, they can be used as a therapeutic agent for prevention or treatment of the neurological disorders caused by the accumulation of oxidation product with facilitation of lipid peroxidation, such as cerebral stroke and dementia as well as inflammatory disease such as arthritis, cardiac infarction, and acute /chronic tissue damage (G.

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 7&gt; Protective effect on brain damage induced by brain ischemia-reperfusion<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compound of formula 1 according to the present invention has the protective effect on brain damage induced by ischemia-reperfusion was accomplished in the below.<br>
Male rat (Sprague-Dawley Rat, 350 ±50 g, Samyook) was<br>
anesthetized by administration of Pentobarbital sodium 40 mg/Kg. PE-19 tubing was inserted to the femoral vein and the artery, left carotid artery was exposed. Before the<br>
operation,  heparin sulfate  20 D  was  injected  to  the<br>
peritoneal cavity. Blood pressure measuring device was inserted to the femoral artery for the continuous<br>
measurement of arterial pressure. Blood(10 D ) was collected from the femoral vein to decrease blood pressure<br>
to 30 mmHg. If blood pressure is not decreased to 100 mmHg by collection of blood (7 D ), it is evaluated that<br>
sympathetic tone is very high. The said case was excluded for experiment, for mortality of rats is high 30 mmHg or even after success in reducing the blood pressure, the rats showed high mortality after the operation.<br>
With blood pressure maintaining to be 30 mmHg, left carotid artery was closed by aneurysm clamp for 20 min to induce ischemia. Reperfusion was accomplished by the<br>
collected blood and 0.84% bicarbonate saline(5 D ). Body temperature of rats was constantly maintained to be 37 ±0.5°C, by using thermal blanket and incandescent light<br>
bulbs during the ischemia. After the operation, in recovering period, body temperature was constantly maintained for more than 2 hours. If rats were recovered entirely, they were transferred to animal laboratory. Condition of animal laboratory, such as temperature, humidity and light cycle was constantly maintained to be<br>
27 °C, 60% and 12-21 hours, respectively.<br>
After  24  hours  from  the  operation,  rats  were sacrificed. Then brain was enucleated from rat within 3 min. Enucleated brain was excised on the ice at the interval 2 mm by using brain matrix to produce six coronal sections.<br>
The said coronal sections were dyed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution at 37 °C for 30 min.<br>
The said dyed coronal section was developed and printed. Thereafter, the ratio of necrosis area to brain area was measured by using Image Analyzer.<br>
Otherwise, test compounds were four times administrated to abdominal cavity at a dose 30 mg/kg. Particularly, test compounds were administrated before 30 min prior to operation as well as after 2, 4, 16 hours from carotid artery closing. For a control group, vehicle was only administrated to the rat in place of test compounds. For a comparative group, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate(MK 801) as noncompetitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) was administrated to the rats.<br>
The protective effect on brain damage induced by brain ischemia-reperfusion was evaluated by calculating reduction of necrosis area to that of brain for a control group. The result was shown in table 8. TABLE 8<br>

Example 11 	30 	14 	21.5±2.6 	46.3 	 <br>
As shown in table 8, infarct volume of comparative group to which MK 801 was administrated at a dose of 30 mg/Kg was 29.8%, which resulted in reduction of the infarct volume by 24.8% relative to that of control group.<br>
Otherwise, infarct volume of test group to which the compound of formula 11 was administrated at a dose of 30mg/kg was 21.5%, which resulted in reduction of the infarct volume by 46.3% relative to that of control group. Therefore, the compound of the present invention had the protective effect on the brain damage induced by brain ischemia-reperfusion two times as much as the reference compound, MK 801 did.<br>
Also, in MK 801-treated group as the comparative group, the side effect such as decrease in mobility in rats was observed. However, in the group to which the compound of formula 11 was administrated, the side effects including changes in motility were not observed. As shown in the<br>
table 2, due to the weak vasodilating effect(ICso &gt; 30 \i M)<br>
of the compound of the present invention, side effect induced by decrease in perfusion to the ischemic brain was greatly reduced.<br>
Since   benzopyran  derivatives   substituted  with secondary  amine,  containing  tetrazole  group  had  the excellent protective effect on the brain damage indeced by brain ischemia-reperfusion, they can be used as an agent for the prevention or treatment of disease caused by brain damage, such as cerebral stroke or dementia (E.V. Golanov, J.D. Christensen, D.J. Reis, Role of potassium channels in the  central  neurogenic  neuroprotection  elicited  by cerebellar stimulation in rat. Brain Research, 1999, 842, 496-500).<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 8&gt; Protective effect on i schema, c-hypoxic brain injury<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compound of formula 1 of the present invention had protective effect on ischemic-hypoxic brain injury, using MRS(magnetic resonance spectrum) was accomplished in the below.<br>
It was reported that in ischemic-hypoxic model of rats, histological test result was significantly correlated to the change of magnetic resonance spectrum. By using the said report, the protective effect on brain damage induced by hypoxia in vitro was investigated. [Van der A. Toorn et al. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 1996, 36, 914-922]. It<br>
was reported that the lipid peak was increased in MRS by ischemic neuronal cell injury due to the destruction of cell membrane including blood-brain barrier. Also, it was reported that increase of lipid concentration was correlated to apoptosis. [A. Bizzi et al. , Magnetic Resonance Imaging, 1996, 14, 581-592]. Therefore, it was reported that Lipid/NAA and Lipid/Cr obtained by comparing lipid with N-acetylaspartate(NAA) and creatine(Cr) as marker of neuronal cell was correlated to morphological changes and severity of apoptosis on hypoxic brain damage.<br>
In new born rats (within 7 days, 10 ~  15 g) , left<br>
carotid artery were intermitted for 3 hours to induce hypoxia.  Test compounds were intraperitoneally injected before 1 hour of hypoxia. Left eye of which the carotid artery was intermitted was used as ischemic-hypoxic model, right eye of which the carotid artery was not intermitted was used as hypoxic model. Magnetic resonance spectrum was obtained  from  both  models,  after  histological  test, accomplished in one day from damage. From the said result, Lipid/NAA or Lipid/Cr was measured. Also, viability and morphological score by macroscopic observation of infarct volume was calculated. The result was shown in table 9. TABLE 9<br>

Survival 	13/26(50%) 	19/24(79%) 	   <br>
Morphological score 	3.0 	1.4 	 <br>
As shown in table 9, the compound of formula 11 of the present invention reduced Lip/NAA and Lip/Cr obtained from magnetic resonance spectrum in ischemic-hypoxic or hypoxic new born rat model, two times or three times as much as that of control group, respectively. Therefore, the compound of the present invention had protective effect on brain damage. Also, in the comparison of viability, the compound of formula 11 significantly increased viability to 79%, more than that of control group (50%) . The compound of formula 11 decreased morphological score obtained from macroscopic observation of infarct volume two times as low as that of control group.<br>
Since benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had protective effect on brain damage induced by ischemic-hypoxic or hypoxia. Therefore, the compound of the present invention can be used as an agent<br>
for prevention or treatment of newborn hypoxia (C. C. Huang et al Measurement of the urinary lactateccreatinine ratio for the early identification of newborn infants at risk for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. New England J. of Medicine, 1999, 341 (5), 328-335).<br><experimental example> Protective effect on neuronal cells damage by axotomy of optic nerve<br>
The experiment whether the compound of formula 1 of the present invention had protective effect on the cell neuronal damage induced by axotomy of optic nerve was shown in the below.<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to prepare stock solution (100 mM) , which was diluted with<br>
physiological saline to the 20 |i M. 10 D of stock solution was injected vitreously.<br>
Adult rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/Kg), then optic nerve was exposed by bulbar conjunctiva. Thereafter, nerve corresponding to 0.5 mm or 3 mm from eye ball was excided, respectively. Or through upper eyelid cutaneous amputation was accomplished, then part of lacrimal gland was removed. Onto eye ball superior<br>
rectus muscle was excised in the ocular muscles to expose the optic nerve. The optic nerve was excised about 5 mm back from eye ball.   Blood vessels of retina supplying blood to retina was not impaired.  Condition of blood vessels of retina was checked with funduscope. Fluorogold (Fluorochrome Inc. 5% in PBS(phosphate buffered solution) was administrated to Half of test group, in the retrograde after axotomy of optic nerve. To investigate cell survival of the ganglion after axotomy, eyes was removed from rats, then retina was isolated in 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks,  2 months,  4 months,  and 6 months. The isolated retina was investigated by transmission electron microscope. For quantitative analysis,  at the same time tissue of retina was prepared. The prepared tissue was investigated by immunochemical dyeing or fluorescent microscope to which<br>
530 ~ 560 run filter was installed. The results were shown<br>
in table 10.<br>

Example 11  (20 |i M) 	43% 	 <br>
As shown in table 10, after axotomy of optic nerve, survival rate of retina ganglion cell from control group was 22%. However, survival rate of retina ganglion cell from test group to which the compound of formula 11 was<br>
administrated at a concentration of 20 ^M   was  43%.<br>
Therefore,  the  compound  of  formula  11  significantly increased survival rate.<br>
Since benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group had the protective effect on death of retina ganglion cell injury induced by axotomy of optic nerve, they can be used as an agent for prevention or treatment of glaucoma induced by impairment of ganglion cell(P. Hardy et al. Oxidant, nitric oxide and prostanoids in the developing ocular vasculature: a basis for ischemic retinopathy Car diovascular Research, 2000, 47, 489-509).<br><experimental example> Effect on motor nerve conduction velocity in diabetic rats<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of formula 1 improve impaired motor nerve conduction velocity in diabetic rats was accomplished in the below.<br>
Diabetes was induced with injection of Streptozotocin<br>
(65mg/kg) in rats, then test compounds dissolved in 2 D of<br>
media(physiological saline : ethanol: tween 80=8:1:1) were orally administrated once a day. Rats were anesthetized with pentotal, then the sciatic nerve was exposed to measure motor nerve conduction velocity. The nerve was stimulated at two points. The first stimulus electrode was inserted at proximal end, and second electrode stimulus electrode was inserted at the distal notch. The coaxia needle electrode was inserted into interdigitala muscle, then the muscle action potential induced by two points stimulation. The conduction velocity was calculated by dividing the distance between two stimulus points by the latency differences. Lipoic acid (100 mg/kg) was used in comparison with the compound of the present invention in recovery of impaired Motor Nerve Conduction Velocity (MNCV) in diabetic rats. The recovery (%) of Motor Nerve Conduction was calculated according to the following mathematical formula 1. The results were shown in table 11. MATHEMATICAL FORMULA 1<br>

As shown in table 11, MNCV of diabetic rats were significantly decreased compared to that of normal control group. Administration of the compound of formula 11 at the dose of 50 mg/kg significantly improved MNCV in diabetic rats.<br>
Since benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention improved MNCV in diabetic rats, they can be used as an agent for prevention or treatment of diabetic neuropathy or diabetic peripheral nerve disorder (K. Naka et al. Effects of stazol on development of experimental diabetic neuropathy: functional and structural studies, and Na+-K+-ATPase acidity in peripheral nerve in rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes.

EXPERIMENTAL  EXAMPLE  11&gt;  Inhibitory  effect  on  NO production<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of formula 1 had an inhibitory effect on NO(nitric oxide) was<br>
accomplished in the below.<br>
Using RPMI1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum(FBS), RAW 264.7 cells(obtained from American Type Culture Collection), a murine macrophage cell line,,<br>
were cultured at 37°C in a 5% C02 incubator. The RAW 264.7 cells were harvested and cell density was adjusted to 5 xlO5 cell/D with a RPMI media supplemented with 0.5% FBS<br>
and plated at 5xl04 cell/well to 96-well plate, which were then cultured for 20 hours in a CC&gt;2 incubator. After removal of the media, the cells were pre-treated for 1 hour<br>
with fresh media containing 30 \.i M. The test compounds were<br>
dissolved in DMSO and diluted to respective concentration in the media. In order to minimize DMSO effect on the nitric oxide formation by the RAW 264.7 cells in the walls, the media were allowed to contain DMSO at a concentration of 0.1% or less.<br>
After   completion   of   one-hour   pre-treatment, Lipopolysaccharide(E. coli serotype 055:B5) was added to<br>
activate the cells at a final concentration of 1 D /Q ,<br>
which were maintained for 24 hours in a C02 incubator. As a result of the activation of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS, NO was formed. The NO release into the media was in a form of<br>
nitrite(N02 ) and quantitatively measured using the Griess reagent. A control group was treated only with vehicle instead of test compounds. Using nitrite standard, it was shown that the test drugs themselves do not hinder the quantification of NO.<br>
The inhibitory effect of the test compounds against NO production were determined as the reduction of NO quantity compared with that of the control group. The results were shown in table 12.<br>

As shown in table 12, benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazol group according to the present invention had inhibitory effect against production of NO induced by endotoxin such as LPS.<br>
Preferably, the compounds prepared in example 29, 45, 58, 60 and 70 had inhibitory effect more than 75% at the<br>
concentration of 30^ M . Most preferably,  the compounds<br>
prepared in example 51 and 53 had inhibitory effect more than 90% at the same concentration.<br>
Since  benzopyran  derivatives   substituted  with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had potent inhibitory effect against NO production, they can be used as an agent for prevention or treatment of the neurological disorders caused by excess production of NO, such as cerebral stroke and dementia as well as inflammatory disease such as arthritis,  cardiac infarction, and acute /chronic tissue damage(J.F. Kerwin Jr. Nitric Oxide: A New Paradigm for second Messengers J. Med. Chem, 1995, 38, 4343-4362).<br>
EXPERIMENTAL  EXAMPLE  12 &gt;  Cardioprotective  effect  in ischemia heart models of rats<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compound of formula 1 had the protective effect (anti-ischemic effect) on ischemic heart was accomplished in the below.<br>
Male  rats(300  ~   450   g,   obtained   form  the<br>
experimental animal team of the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology) were anaesthetized by the intra-peritoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Heparin (1,000 U/kg) was injected to the tail vein and then the heart was enucleated. Particularly, cannula(PE 240) was inserted to the organ. Rats were mechanically ventilated with a rodent ventilator, in situ aorta cannula was inserted into their aorta. In retorograde perfusion, their hearts were enucleated, then just hung onto Langendorff Apparatus. Tissue attached at the heart was removed. Heart was perfused in oxygenated modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer(composition<mm> 116 NaCl, 4.7 KC1, 1.1 MgS04, 1.17 KH2P04, 24.9 NaHC03, 2.52 CaCl2, 8.32 Glucose, 2.0 Pyruvate) at a constant perfusion pressure (85mmHg). A metal cannula attached to latex balloon filled with solvent (ethanol: water=l:1(v/v)) was placed in the left ventricle through pulmonary vein and connected to a isovolumetric pressure transducer (H.S.E., Germany) for measurement of left ventricular pressure(LVP). The hearts were allowed to equilibrate for 15 min, at which time left ventricular end-diastolic pressure(EDP) was adjusted to 5 mmHg and this balloon volume was maintained throughout the experiment.<br>
Baseline cardiac contractile function, heart rate(HR),<br>
and coronary flow(CF) were measured. Cardiac contractile function was calculated by substracting LVSP(left ventricular peak systolic pressure) from LVEDP(left ventricular end diastolic pressure), yielding LVDP (left ventricular developed pressure). Double product RPP(rate-pressure product)(DP), another important parameter for indirectly assessing cardiac performance in Langendorff heart impossible to measure cardiac output was calculated by multiplying HR by LVDP.<br>
Throughout the experiment, total coronary blood flow was measured by the use of coronary flow probe (diameter: 1.0 mm) installed in aortic cannula with electromagnetic flowmeter. Temperature of heart was steadily maintained by<br>
immersing  the  heart  at  37°C  in  physiological  saline<br>
solution to which 95% 02/5% C02 was constantly supplied. After stabilization for 15 min, the hearts were pre-treated for 10 min in vehicle (0.04% DMSO) or mixture containing the compound of the present invention or control material. Thereafter, cardiac contractile function, HR and CF were repeatedly measured. Global ischemia was induced by completely shutting off the perfusate for 30 min. Severity of ischemia was determined as the time to contracture (TTC, min) during global ischemia in which the first 5 mmHg increase in EDP was observed. Then, the hearts were<br>
reperfused and, 30 min later, contractile functions (LVDP, HR and CF) was repeatedly measured. After reperfusion was accomplished for 30 min, LDH(lactate dehydrogenase) was measured as a sensitive index for loss of cell viability with a kit. The results were shown in table 13.<br>
TABLE 13 cardioprotective effect in ischemic heart models of rats<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
In vehicle-treated group, reperfusion DP( LVDP X HR) , a index for contractility function, was decreased to 23.0% of pre-treatment DP, and EDP was increased to 43.3 mmHg from 5 mmHg, and TTC was 20.3 min, and reperfusion LDH release was 29.9 u/g as shown in the above.<br>
In BMS-180448 treated group, reperfusion contractile function (DP, LVDP x HR) was 67.6% of pre-treatment DP, which was significantly improved compared to vehicle treated group. EDP was 16.5 mmHg, significantly lower than<br>
control, and TTC was 27.8 min, prolonged than control, and reperfusion LDH release was 17.2 U/g, decreased than control. Then, in BMS-180448 treated group all parameters showed significant protective effect on ischemic heart.<br>
When compared only in anti-ischemic effect from those parameters, cardiac contractile function, EDP, TTC, and LDH release, the compounds of the present invention were similar to or superior to BMS-180448. However, because the compounds of the present invention are remarkably lower vasorelaxant effect than BMS-180448 dose, they are far superior to the conventional drug in cardioselective antiischemic activity. Especially, the compound of example 32 showed a good cardioprotective effect, of which contractile function(LVDP x HR) was improved to 64.7% of pre-treatment index, and EDP was 17.0 mmHg, and TTC was 27.9 min, and reperfusion LDH release was 15.7 U/g, with very low vasodilation activity. So, it shows much better cardioselectivity upon vasodilation than is BMS-180448. Consequently, the compounds of the present invention can be used for the treatment of ischemic heart disease by virtue of their excellent selectivity and protective activity against ischemic cardiovascular disease. In addition, the compounds prepared in example 1, 11 and 32 of the present invention had the excellent protective effect against the<br>
cell   damage  by  ischemia-reperfusion  by  decreasing reperfusion LDH release.<br>
Since benzopyran derivatives substituted with secondary amine, containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had the protective effect on ischemic heart, similar to or superior to that of BMS-180448, more preferably they had low vasodilating effect relative to BMS-180448, they can be used as an agent for prevention or treatment of heart infarction, heart failure or angina by virtue of their excellent selectivity and protective activity(T. Miura et al. Roles of Mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K Channels and PKC in Anti-Infarct Tolerance afforded by Adenosine Al receptor Activation. J Am Coll Cardiol, 1999, 35, 238-45; D. J. Chambers, D. J.

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 13&gt; Inhibitory effect against HUVEC tube formation<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compounds of the present invention had inhibitory effect against HUVEC tube formation was accomplished in the below.<br>
HUVEC(Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell)were cultured, and tubulogenesis(tube formation) was induced in vascular endothelial cells by plating them onto the surface of Matrigel for several hours. The effect on tube formation of the test compounds were compared with the vehicle -treated control group, then confirmed their in-vitro anti-angiogenic effect indirectly. The results were shown in table 14.<br>

(Table Remove)<br>
As  shown  in  table  14,  HUVEC  tube  formation was inhibited  at  concentration  of  10  \i M,  and  strongly<br>
inhibited at concentration of 100 \i M in the compound<br>
prepared in example 2, in a concentration dependent manner. Also, the compound prepared in example 28 had inhibitory effect against tube formation, to suppress angiogenesis<br>
Since  benzopyran  derivatives   substituted  with<br>
secondary amine,  containing tetrazole group according to the present invention had potent inhibitory effect against angiogenesis, they can be used for the medical treatment of various  diseases  related  to  angiogenesis,   such  as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, AIDS complication, cancers, diabetic  retinopathy,  etc(P.  A.  Burke,  S.J.  DeNardo Antiangiogenic agents and their promising potential  in combined therapy. Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology, 2001, 39, 155-171).<br>
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 14&gt; Acute oral toxicity test in rats<br>
The experiment confirming whether the compound of formula 1 of the present invention had acute oral toxicity was accomplished in the below.<br>
In this test, six-week old SPF SD rats were used with two rats assigned to each group. Each group was consisted of two rats. The compounds prepared in example 1, 7, 11, 17, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 42, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 70, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, and 89 were suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose, respectively. Then, the suspensions were administrated orally at a single dose of 1 g/kg/15 ml. after the administration,  the animals were observed for clinical signs of toxicity or mortality and the body weight<br>
changes were measured. Also, hematological test and biochemical analysis were accomplished. After sacrificing the animals, autopsy was performed for macroscopic observations of the organs and tissues. As a result, there was no significant changes in clinical symptoms, body weight and mortalities. Also in hematology, serum chemistry parameters, macroscopic observation and drug-related changes were not observed. As a result all the compounds tested did not show toxicity in rats up to a dose of 2 g/kg, and the lethal dose(LDBo) for oral administration was determined to be over 2 g/kg.<br><br>
