				<td>Method for production of optically active (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)-propan-1-ol<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing optically active (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol by enzymatic reduction.<br>
Prior art:<br>
(1S)-3-Chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol is a direct precursor for the preparation of (1S)-3-methylamino-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol ("Duloxetine alcohol"), which is in turn an in¬termediate in Duloxetine synthesis. Duloxetine® is an active pharmaceutical ingredient v\/hich is currently in the process of being approved and is intended for use for indica¬tions of depression and incontinence.<br>
EP-B-0273658 describes a process for preparing the corresponding base for Duloxet¬ine by reacting 2-acetylthiophene in a Mannich reaction w\\h formaldehyde and di-methylamine, reduction of the keto group of the resulting Mannich base to the racemic (S)-3-N,N-dimethylamino-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-ol, etherification of the alcohol function with naphthyl fluoride and finally conversion of the dimethylamino group to a methyl-amino function. The desired enantiomer of the naphthyl ether is obtained by use of chiral starting materials or by racemate separation at the stage of the end product, for example via the salts with optically active acids or chromatography on a chiral station¬ary phase.<br>
US-5,362,886 describes an analogous process in which the racemic propanol obtained at reduction of the keto group is admixed with S-mandelic acid. The resulting S-enantiomer of the alcohol is used in the subsequent reaction stages.<br>
EP-A-0457559 likewise describes a process analogous to EP-B-0273658. Here, the keto group of the Mannich base is reduced with the asymmetric reduction system LAH-Icb (lithium aluminum hydride-[(2R,2S)-(-)-4-dimethylamino-1,2-diphenyl-3-methyl-2-butanol]) to the alcohol in the form of the S-enantiomer. A disadvantage here, in addi-<br><br>
tion to the costs, is the sensitivity of the LAH-lcb reduction system which is stable for only a few minutes.<br>
In Joumal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals, Volume XXXVI, 3, page 213 to 223, W. J. Wheeler and F. Kuo describe a process for preparing Duloxetine. For this purpose, thiophene-2-carbonyl chloride is reacted in a Stille coupling with vinyltri-n-butylstannan in the presence of catalytic amounts of benzylchlorobis(triphenylphos-phine)palladium(ll) in DMPU (dimethylpropyleneurea) to give 1-(thien-2-yl)propenone of the formula (V)<br><br>
The alcohol thus obtained is converted by successive reaction with sodium iodide and then with methylamine to (S)-3-methylamino-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-ol. Subsequent successive reaction with sodium hydride, 1-fluoronaphthalene and hydrogen chloride affords Duloxetine in the form of the hydrochloride.<br><br>

In Chemie IngenieurTechnIk (74) pages 1035-1039, 2002, T. Stillger et al. describe substrate-coupled cofactor regeneration processes for enzymatic enantioselective re¬duction of etiiyl 5-oxohexanoate to etiiyl (S)-5-hydroxy-hexanoate.<br>
Brief description of the invention:<br>
It was an object of the invention to find a route for stereospecific reduction of optically active (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol, in which the reaction process should lead highly quantitatively to the product by an inexpensive route.<br>
This object is achieved by virtue of the surprising finding that it is possible to prepare enzymes with dehydrogenase activity from the Thermoanaerobacter genus, which are capable of stereospecific catalysis of the above reaction.<br>
Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The invention provides a process for preparing optically active (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-<br>
thienyl)propan-1-ol of the formula I<br><br><br>
reducing this compound to tlie compound of the formula I by means of an alcohol de¬hydrogenase from the Thermoanaerobacter genus, and isolating the product formed in substantially enantiomerically pure form.<br>
The enzymes with dehydrogenase activity used in accordance with the invention can be used in the process according to the invention as free or immobilized enzyme.<br>
The process according to the invention is advantageously carried out at a temperature between 0°C to 95°C, preferably between 10°C to 85°C, more preferably between 15°Cto75°C.<br>
The pH in the process according to the invention is advantageously kept between pH 4 and 12, preferably between pH 4.5 and 9, more preferably between pH 5 and 8.<br>
In the process according to the invention, enantiomerically pure or chiral products or optically active alcohols are understood to mean enantiomers which exhibit enanti¬omeric enrichment. In the process, preference is given to achieving enantiomeric puri¬ties of at least 70% ee, preferably of min. 80% ee, more preferably of min. 90% ee, most preferably min. 98% ee.<br>
For the process according to the invention, it is possible to use growing cells which comprise the inventive nucleic acids, nucleic acid constructs or vectors. It is also possi¬ble to use quiescent or disrupted cells. Disrupted cells are understood to mean, for example, cells which have been made permeable by means of a treatment with, for example, solvents, or cells which have been disrupted by means of an enzyme treat¬ment, by means of a mechanical treatment (for example French Press or ultrasound) or by means of another method. The crude extracts thus obtained are suitable in an ad¬vantageous manner for the process according to the invention. It is also possible to use purified or partly purified enzymes for .the process. Immobilized microorganisms or en¬zymes, which can advantageously find use in the reaction, are likewise suitable.<br>
When free organisms or enzymes are used for the process according to the invention, they are appropriately removed before the extraction, for example by means of a filtra¬tion or centrifugation.<br><br>
The (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol prepared in the process according to the invention can advantageously be obtained from the aqueous reaction solution by means of extraction or distillation. To increase the yield, the extraction can be repeated more than once. Examples of suitable extractants are solvents such as toluene, me¬thylene chloride, butyl acetate, diisopropyl ether, benzene, MTBE or ethyl acetate, without any restriction thereto.<br>
Alternatively, the (1S)-3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-ol product prepared in the proc¬ess according to the invention can advantageously be obtained from the organic phase of the reaction solution by means of extraction or distillation or/and crystallization. To increase the yield, the extraction can be repeated more than once. Examples of suit¬able extractants are solvents such as toluene, methylene chloride, butyl acetate, diiso¬propyl ether, benzene, MTBE or ethyl acetate, without any restriction thereto.<br>
After concentration of the organic phase, the products can generally be obtained in good chemical purities, i.e. greater than 80% chemical purity. After extraction, the or¬ganic phase comprising the product can also be concentrated only partly and the prod¬uct can be crystallized out. To this end, the solution is advantageously cooled to a tem¬perature of from 0°C to 10°C. The crystallization can also be effected directly out of the organic solution or out of an aqueous solution. The product which has been crystallized out can once again be taken up in the same solvent or in another solvent for another crystallization and crystallized once again. The subsequent advantageous crystalliza¬tion carried out at least once can further increase the enantiomeric purity of the product if required.<br>
In the workup methods mentioned, the product of the process according to the inven¬tion can be isolated in yields of from 60 to 100%, preferably from 80 to 100%, more preferably from 90 to 100%, based on the substrate used for the reaction, for example from 3-chloro-1-(2-thienyl)propan-1-one. The isolated product features a high chemical purity of &gt; 90%, preferably &gt; 95%, more preferably &gt; 98%. Moreover, the products have a high enantiomeric purity which can advantageously, if required, be increased further by the crystallization.<br><br>
The process according to the invention can be conducted batchwise, semibatchwise or continuously.<br>
The process can advantageously be carried out in bioreactors, as described, for exam¬ple, in Biotechnoiogy, volume 3, 2nd edition, eds. Rehm et al. (1993), in particular chapter II.<br>
The above description and the examples which follow serve only to illustrate the inven¬tion. The numerous possible modifications apparent to the person skilled in the art are likewise comprised by the invention.<br>
The advantage of the process according to the invention lies in the particularly high yield of the optically active alkanol of the formula (I) and of virtually quantitative conver¬sion of alkanone (II).<br>
The enzymatic reduction by means of alcohol dehydrogenase requires cofactors which are consumed in the course of the reaction. I.e. oxidized. A preferred cofactor is NADPH which is oxidized to NADP.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention regenerates the cofactors by coupling them with a simultaneous oxidation reaction. For this purpose, particular preference Is given to the alkanol/ketone system, in particular isopropanol/acetone, since this is likewise catalyzed by the alcohol dehydrogenase.<br>
The NADPH consumed In the reduction of compound (II) to compound (I) is regener¬ated again by the enzymatic oxidation of isopropanol to acetone. It should be ensured here that sufficient Isopropanol (so-called sacrificial alcohol) is available, and that no excessively high concentrations of acetone which might damage the enzyme are form¬ed.<br>
Experimental part:<br><br>
Enzyme<br>
The alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter spec, used hereinafter (abbre¬viated hereinafter to ADH-T) is commercially available and was purchased from Julich Fine Chemicals (Order No. 90112610, alcohol dehydrogenase Tfrom Thermoanaero-bacter spec). The ADH-T was used without further purification.<br>
Incubation with NADPH<br>
In one ml of 50 mM NaH2P04 buffer (pH 5), 10 //mol of NADPH, 10 /ymol of 3-chloro-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-one and ADH-T (0.58 mg of protein) were incubated at 30°C. After 60 min, the reaction was ended by adding HCIconc. and the denatured protein was re¬moved by means of centrifugation. After centrifugation, the supernatant was analyzed by chromatography. With reference to the peal
Incubation with NADP and isopropanol (cofactor regeneration)<br>
The NADPH cofactor is consumed during the reaction. It is known that the ADH-T per¬forms the oxidation of i-propanol to acetone and can thus regenerate the consumed cofactor. This method is advantageous because NADPH has to be added to the reac¬tion mixture only in catalytic amounts.<br>
In one ml of buffer (50 mM NaH2P04 (pH 5) with 10% 2-propanol), 0.2 //mol of NADP, 10//mol of 3-chloro-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-one and ADH-T (0.58 mg of protein) were incubated at SOX. After 60 min, the reaction was ended by adding HCIconc. and the denatured protein was removed by means of centrifugation. Workup and analysis are effected as described above.<br>
Analysis of (1S)-3-chloro-1-(tliien-2-yl)propan-1-ol<br>
The concentration of 3-chloro-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-one and 3-chloro-1-(thien-2-<br>
yl)propan-1-ol can be determined by means of HPLC. Depending on the selection of<br>
the stationary and mobile phase, it is also possible to determine ee value in addition to<br>
the concentration.<br>

Authentic material is used to generate a calibration curve, with the aid of which the concentration of unknown samples can be determined.<br>
Result<br>
Reaction without cofactor regeneration<br>
After incubation for 60min, 2.1 mM (1S)-3-chloro-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-ol was deter¬mined in the reaction mixture. The specific activity of the ADH-T at the start of the reac¬tion is 98 U/g of protein. The resulting alcohol has an ee value of 95%.<br><br>
Reaction with cofactor regeneration<br>
In this system too, the ADH-T is capable of catalyzing both reduction and oxidation reaction by substrate coupling. After incubation for one hour, however, only 0.7 mM (1S)-3-chloro-1-(thien-2-yl)propan-1-ol was found in the reaction mixture. The specific activity of the enzyme at the start of the reaction is also very low at 23 U/g of protein. The resulting alcohol has an ee value of 94%. The relatively low activity can be ex¬plained by the possibility that the optimal conditions of the isopropanol oxidation were not present. Possibly, the equilibrium position of the overall reaction is also unfavor¬able.<br>
Alternatively, the cofactor regeneration can also effect the addition of an auxiliary en¬zyme, for example a glucose dehydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase. In this case, another second substrate such as glucose or formate is needed instead of isopropanol. Glucose dehydrogenase oxidizes glucose to gluconic acid and, in doing so, reduces the cofactor during the cofactor regeneration with formate dehydrogenase to CO2 as the end product.<br><br><br>
