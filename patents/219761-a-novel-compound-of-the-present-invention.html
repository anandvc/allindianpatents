(1-4-PIPERIDINYLJBENZIMIDAZOLE   DERIVATIVES   USEFUL  AS   HISTAMINE   H3   ANTAGONISTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted benzimidazoles and aza- and diaza-derivatives thereof useful as histamine H3 antagonists. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds and their use in treating inflammatory diseases, allergic conditions and central nervous system disorders. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of novel histamine H3 antagonists of this invention with histamine H1compounds for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and allergic conditions, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising a combination of one or more novel histamine H3 antagonist compounds of the invention with one or more histamine H1compounds.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The histamine receptors, H1, H2 and H3 are well-identified forms. The H1 receptors are those that mediate the response antagonized by conventional antihistamines. H1receptors are present, for example, in the ileum, the skin, and the bronchial smooth muscle of humans and other mammals. Through H2 receptor-mediated responses, histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion in mammals and the chronotropic effect in isolated mammalian atria.<br>
H3 receptor sites are found on sympathetic nerves, where they modulate sympathetic neurotransmission and attenuate a variety of end organ responses under control of the sympathetic nervous system. Specifically, H3 receptor activation by histamine attenuates norepinephrine outflow to resistance and capacitance vessels, causing vasodilation.<br><br>
Imidazole H3 receptor antagonists are well known in the art. More recently, non-imidazole H3 receptor antagonists have been disclosed in PCT US01/32151, filed October 15, 2001, and US Provisional Application 60/275,417, filed March 13, 2001.<br>
US 5,869,479 discloses compositions for the treatment of the symptoms of<br>
allergic rhinitis using a combination of at least one histamine H1receptor antagonist<br>
and at least one histamine H3 receptor antagonist.<br>

The compounds of this invention are ligands for the histamine H3 receptor. The compounds of this invention can also be desC1ibed as antagonists of the H3 receptor, or as H3 antagonists.<br>
The compounds of the invention are basic and form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic aC1ds. Examples of suitable aC1ds for such salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, C1tric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, sucC1nic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral<br><br>
and carboxylic aC1ds well known to those skilled in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a suffiC1ent amount of the desired aC1d to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their corresponding salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their corresponding free base forms for purposes of this invention.<br>
Depending upon the substituents on the inventive compounds, one may be able to form salts with bases. ThusP for example, if there are carboxylic aC1d substituents in the molecule, salts may be formed with inorganic as well as organic bases such as, for example, NaOH, KOH, NH4OH, tetraalkylammonium hydroxide,<br>
and the like.<br>
The compounds of formula I can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, e.g., hemi-hydrate. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol and the like are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention can be combined with an H1receptor antagonist (i.e., the compounds of this invention can be combined with an H1receptor antagonist in a pharmaceutical composition, or the compounds of this invention can be administered with H1receptor antagonist).<br>
Numerous chemical substances are known to have histamine H1receptor antagonist activity and can therefore be used in the methods of this invention.

in DMF (13 ml) was added solid EDC1 (163 mg; 0.851 mmol). The cloudy reaction mixture was placed in a preheated oil bath and was stirred at 50 °C for 30 min, after which the resultant clear, amber solution was stirred for 23.5 h at RT. A few drops of water were added, and the reaction mixture was concentrated at 60 °C under vacuum. The concentrate was partitioned between EtOAc (20 ml) and water (5 ml)-brine (2.5 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (2x5 ml). Combined extracts were washed with brine (2.5 ml) and filtered through anhydrous MgS04. The filtrate was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with a gradient of CH2C12-CH3OH-NH4OH (97:3:0.5 -&gt; 96:4:0.5). Product 6D (222 mg; 47%) was obtained as pale yellow powder. FABMS: 689 (MH+; -93%); 578 (-58%); 478 (100%). Step 5:<br>
To a solution of 6D (208 mg; 0.302 mmol) in CH2C12 (3 ml) was added TFA (928 miC1oliters; 1.37 g; 12.1 mmol) with swirling of the flask, which was then flushed with dry N2, sealed and allowed to stand at RT for 6 h. The reaction solution was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc (20 ml) and 2M Na2CC3 (3 ml) plus suffiC1ent water to produce two clear phases. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (3x5 ml). Combined extracts were washed with brine (3 ml) and filtered through anhydrous MgS04. The filtrate was stripped of solvent in vacuo, and the residue was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with CH2ClrCH3OH-NH4OH (97:3:0.5). The title compound (130 mg; 72%) was obtained as pale yellow powder. FABMS: 589 (MH+; -64%); 478 (100%).<br>
Using procedures similar to those desC1ibed above, employing the appropriate starting materials, compounds in the following tables are prepared:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
A solution of 388B (0.66 g, 2.2 mmol) in DMF (15 ml) was treated with 5C (0.62 g, 2.5 mmol), 1-propanephosphonic aC1d cyclic anhydride (3.3 ml, 11.2 mmol, 50 wt. % in EtOAc) and N-ethylmorpholine (1.4 ml, 10.7 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 3h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and diluted with EtOAc. The solution was washed three times with 5% aqueous NaOH, dried over Na2S04, concentrated and subjected to flash chromatography (10% 2N NH3-CH3OH/EtOAc). The material was then taken up in CH2C12 (20 ml) and treated with 4 M HC1-dioxane (4 ml). After stirring overnight at 20 °C, the reaction was carefully basified with 10% aqueous NaOH and extracted with CH2C12. The combined organic layers were dried over Na2S04, concentrated and subjected to flash chromatography (30% 2N NH3-CH3OH/EtOAc) to provide 388C as a white solid (0.08g, 10%).<br><br>
To a stirred, cloudy solution of 389A (300 mg, 1.14 mmol) in THF (15 ml) were added a solution of 389B (292 mg, 1.37 mmol) in THF (1 ml), followed by NaBH(OAc)3 (483 mg, 2.28 mmol). After stirring at RT for 39 h, TLC revealed the presence of unchanged starting materials in the cloudy white reaction suspension. Therefore, another quantity of NaBH(OAc)3 (242 mg, 1.14 mmol) was added and stirring at RT continued for a total of 113 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered and collected solids washed thoroughly with CH2C12. The combined filtrate and washings were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc (60 ml) and a solution consisting of water (2.5 ml), 2M Na2C03 (6.5 ml) and 6N NaOH (5<br><br>
mi). The aqueous layer was further extracted with EtOAc (3x15 ml). The combined extracts were washed with brine (5 ml) and dried over anhydrous MgS04. Drying agent was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes = 1:1) to obtain 389C as a mixture of colorless gum and white foam (368 mg, 70%), homogeneous to TLC, which solidified upon standing. ES-MS: 461 (MhT; 100%).<br><br>
F To a stirred, ice-cold solution of 389C (358 mg, 0.777 ml) in CH2C12 (7 ml) was<br>
added via syringe cold, neat TFA (576 miC1oliters, 886 mg, 7.77 mmol). The resultant<br>
solution was stirred in an ice-water bath for 30 min, then at RT for 29.5 h. Volatiles<br>
were removed under vacuum, and the gummy residue was triturated (magnetic stirrer)<br>
with Et20 (35 ml) for 16 h. Filtration and washing with Et20 yielded the bis-<br>
trifluoroacetate salt of 389D as a white powder (449 mg, 98%).<br>
Step 3:<br>
To a stirred suspension of 389D (100 mg, 0.170 mmol) in CH2C12 (5 ml) was added Et3N (47.4 miC1oliters, 34.4 mg, 0.340 mmol), whereupon all solids dissolved. To the stirred solution were then added 5G (25.1 mg, 0.204 mmol), followed by NaBH(OAc)3 (72.1 mg, 0.340 mmol). After stirring at RT for 66 h, TLC revealed the presence of unchanged starting materials in the light yellow reaction suspension. Therefore, another quantity of NaBH(OAc)3 (72.1 mg, 0.340 mmol) was added and stirring at RT continued for a total of 90 h. The reaction mixture was then filtered and '    collected solids washed thoroughly with CH2C12. The combined filtrate and washings were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc (20 ml) and a solution consisting of water (0.6 ml), 2M Na2C03 (1.5 ml) and 6N NaOH (1.2 ml). The aqueous layer was further extracted with EtOAc (3x5 ml). The combined extracts were washed with brine (2 ml) and dried over anhydrous MgSO-*. Drying agent was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by preparative TLC (silica gel; CH2C12/CH3OH/conc. NH4OH = 90:9:1) to obtain the title compound as a light beige foam (36 mg, 45%). FABMS: 468 (MH+; 100%).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

General Procedure for H3-Receptor Binding Assay<br>
The source of the H3 receptors in this experiment was guinea pig brain. The<br>
animals weighed 400-600 g. The brain tissue was homogenized with a solution of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. The final concentration of tissue in the homogenization buffer was 10% w/v. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 10 min. in order to remove clumps of tissue and debris. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 50,000 x g for 20 min. in order to sediment the membranes, which were next<br><br>
washed three times in homogenization buffer (50,000 x g for 20 min. each). The membranes were frozen and stored at -70°C until needed.<br>
All compounds to be tested were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted into the binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5) such that the final concentration was 2 pg/ml with 0.1% DMSO. Membranes were then added (400 pg of protein) to the reaction tubes.<br>
The reaction was started by the addition of 3 nM [3H]R-a-methyl histamine (8.8<br>
C1/mmol) or 3 nM [3H]Na -methyl histamine (80 C1/mmol) and continued under incubation at 30°C for 30 min. Bound ligand was separated from unbound ligand by filtration, and the amount of radioactive ligand bound to the membranes was quantitated by liquid sC1ntillation spectrometry. All incubations were performed in duplicate and the standard error was always less than 10%. Compounds that inhibited more than 70% of the speC1fic binding of radioactive ligand to the receptor were serially diluted to determine a Kj (nM).<br>
