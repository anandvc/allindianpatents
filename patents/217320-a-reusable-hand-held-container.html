FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to containers. More specifically, the current invention relates to containers for predissolving a composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a known and wide-spread consumer habit to predissolve cleaning compositions, especially in countries where hand-washing is common. Consumers typically predissolve granular cleaning compositions such as granular laundry detergents. But, there are few tools and containers made specifically for the purpose of predissolving cleaning compositions. In addition to being messy, the containers habitually used by some consumers tend to be large and bulky containers, such as mop buckets or wash basins. Some consumers usually use large amounts of water to completely predissolve detergents, believing that detergents must be completely dissolved to achieve greater performance. These large containers are inconvenient to use, and store.<br>
To adequately clean certain areas of garments, such as heavily soiled areas, spots, and collars, it is a common habit to pre-treat specific areas with cleaning products. Pre-treating usually entails washing or scrubbing a soiled area with a detergent and/or bleach product which is specifically intended for pre-treating. These "pre-treaters" include spray-on pre-treaters contained in a spraying applicator, gel-type pre-treaters, and stick-type pre-treaters. Such pre-treaters typically include the detergent and/or bleach product within a specific pre-treater container. When the pre-treatment composition is completely consumed, the pre-treater container itself is typically discarded as waste. As such disposable pre-treater containers may be formed of certain plastics, or other non-biodegradable materials, some consumers find them environmentally undesirable.<br>
Alternatively, certain re-usable pre-treaters are known which predissolve a detergent to provide a pre-treating solution. However, these pre-treaters may be complicated to assemble, and/or may be expensive to fabricate. For example, a pre-treater which contains a filter may be excellent at preventing clogging; however, the filter itself may be expensive, or may require additional steps in order to assemble within the pre-treater. Also, known pre-treaters may require that the manufacturing tolerances of the container be very closely followed, so as to prevent leaking. Such inflexible manufacturing tolerances require an increased level of technological complexity, and tight control over manufacturing processes. These additional features and/or fabrication steps may significantly ' increase the pre-treater's manufacturing costs. Such pre-treaters may therefore be too expensive to produce and sell in countries where hand washing, pretreating, and/or predissolving is most common.<br>
Accordingly, the need exists for a pre-treater for predissolving a detergent and/or bleaching composition, which is easy to use, and inexpensive to produce and assemble. The need also exists for a re-useable pre-treater having one or more of these characteristics.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a hand-held container for predissolving a detergent composition including a housing and an aperture cover. The housing is for containing a predetermined amount of a detergent composition and a solvent, and includes a dispensing passage. The dispensing passage includes a distal end and a flow restriction portion at the distal end. The flow restriction portion includes at least one aperture. The aperture cover includes an aperture plug corresponding to each aperture. When the aperture cover covers the distal end, each aperture plug passes substantially through one aperture.<br>
It has now been found that a hand-held container having a flow restriction portion including an aperture and an aperture cover with an aperture plug which passes substantially through the aperture avoids the need for a filter to prevent clogging. The container is easy to assemble, inexpensive to produce, and/or easy to use. The hand-held container is preferably re-useable, in order to reduce waste.<br>
These and other features, aspects, advantages, and variations of the present invention, and the embodiments described herein, will become evident to<br>
those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure with the appended claims, and are covered within the scope of these claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from the following description of preferred embodiments which is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a cut-away view of an embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a close-up cut-away view of an embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (°C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention. The drawings herein are not necessarily drawn to scale.<br>
As used herein, the term "blockage" typically indicates a mixture of detergent and/or solvent which either partially, or completely blocks, occludes, or obstructs the aperture to reduce or eliminate flow of the detergent composition and solvent through the aperture. The blockage is typically a partially-dissolved gel or paste-like mass. Alternatively, the blockage may be contain dirt, or other impurities which have been accidentally, or purposely introduced into the container.<br>
As used herein, the term "inwardly" indicates towards the bottom of the housing and thus, away from the aperture, with respect to the referenced point.<br>
Referring to the figures, Fig. 1 shows a cut-away view of an embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 1, the container, 10, is formed by a housing, 12, for containing a predetermined amount of a detergent composition and a solvent, 14. In the preferred embodiment of Fig. 1, the housing further includes a cap member, 16, which includes a dispensing passage, 18, through which the detergent composition and solvent, 14, must pass in order to exit the container,<br>
10.   The housing, 12, and the optional cap member, 16, form a substantially water-tight seal so as to avoid leakage and messiness during use.<br>
The dispensing passage, 18, contains a distal end, 20, situated distal from the detergent composition and solvent, 14. The distal end, 20, contains a flow restriction portion, 22, which prevents the detergent composition and solvent, 14, from flowing out of the container, 10, too quickly and messily. The flow restriction portion, 22, includes at least one aperture, 24, through which the detergent composition and solvent, 14, may exit the container, 10, when it is properly aligned so as to dispense the detergent composition and solvent, 14, out of the aperture, 24.<br>
The term "aperture" as used herein does not include open-cell structures and porous structures, such as sponges. Such open-cell and convoluted porous structures are not intended to be within the scope of the present invention, because the aperture plug can not clear a blockage from such a structure when the aperture cover is replaced on the distal end. The number and size(s) of the aperture(s) should be tailored to specific physical characteristics of the detergent solution to be dispensed, the solvent used, and consumer preferences. For example, a viscous fluid requires either a larger aperture or a greater number of apertures, for easy and effective dispensing; conversely, a low viscosity fluid would require either a small aperture or relatively few of them, so as to prevent too much detergent and solvent from being dispensed too quickly. A preferred aperture size is from about 0.2 mm2 to about 500 mm2, more preferably from about 0.7 mm2 to about 150 mm2, and even more preferably from about 1.7 mm2 to about 60 mm2 in area. If more than one aperture is present, then the total area of all apertures is preferably within these ranges.<br>
In Fig. 1, the single aperture, 24, is covered with and enclosed by an aperture cover, 26, which prevents leaking of the detergent composition and solvent, 14. The aperture cover, 26, is placed on the distal end, 20, to cover the aperture, 24, when the container, 10, is not being used to apply the detergent composition and solvent, 14. However, when the detergent composition and solvent, 14, is to be applied to an item. the aperture cover. 26, should be removed, and the container, 10, tilted and optionally squeezed to dispense the detergent composition and solyent, 14, out of the aperture. 24. Thus, the aperture cover, 26, removably covers the distal end, 20, the flow restriction portion, 22, and the aperture, 24.<br>
When in place, the aperture cover reduces messiness if the container is shaken, dropped, or falls over; however, when removed, the aperture cover should not block, hinder, or interfere with dispensing of the detergent composition and solvent from the container. As the container may often be shaken in order to predissolve the detergent composition and/or to mix the detergent composition and solvent, it is highly preferred that the aperture cover forms a water-tight seal with a container portion. When the aperture cover covers the distal end, this water-tight seal may be formed between the aperture cover and the aperture itself, between the aperture cover and the applicator, between the aperture cover and the cap member, and/or between the aperture cover and any other suitable portion of the container. In a highly preferred embodiment, when the aperture cover covers the distal end, the aperture and the aperture plug (see below, at 28) form a substantially water-tight seal. For similar reasons, it is preferred that the housing and the optional cap member also form a water-tight seal.<br>
The aperture cover, 26, further contains an aperture plug, 28. When the aperture cover, 26, covers the distal end, 20, the aperture plug, 28, passes substantially through the aperture, 24, to the inside of the container, 10, at the distal end, 20. This allows the aperture plug, 28, to dislodge any detergent composition and solvent, 14, which may otherwise clog up the aperture, 24. Accordingly, if the aperture, 24, clogs because of a blockage during use, merely closing the aperture cover, 26, and removing it will typically clear the blockage by pushing it back into the dispensing passage, 18. The blockage then falls back into the dispensing passage, 18, and/or the bottom of the housing, 12. Thus, an aperture plug, 28, which passes substantially through the aperture, 24, significantly reduces or even eliminates blockages when the aperture cover is removably placed on the distal end. Preferably the aperture contains an interior aperture edge (Fig. 2 at 34), and the aperture plug extends beyond the interior aperture edge and into the distal end, more preferably the aperture plug extends at least 0.1 mm beyond the interior aperture edge and into the distal end, and even more preferably the aperture plug extends from about 0.1 mm to about 10 mm beyond the interior aperture edge and into the distal end. The aperture plug described herein eliminates the need for a filter (not shown). As a filter is typically expensive, and the installation of a filter requires additional attachments and/or assembly steps (e.g., gluing, or sealing) which may significantly increase<br>
the complexity and expense of fabricating the container, it is highly preferred that the container herein does not contain a filter.<br>
Multiple apertures (not shown) and aperture' plugs (not shown) are also useful in the present invention. If multiple apertures are present at the distal end, then the aperture cover includes an aperture plug corresponding to each aperture, and each aperture plug passes substantially through one aperture (i.e., the corresponding aperture). Preferably, one aperture plug passes substantially through each aperture, and each aperture plug forms a substantially water-tight seal with the corresponding aperture. Preferably the number of apertures and corresponding aperture plugs is from about 1 to about 10, more preferably from about 1 to about 6, and even more preferably from about 1 to about 3. Multiple apertures and their corresponding aperture plugs may be arranged together, in a pattern, or separately, and are preferably arranged together.<br>
In Fig. 1, the aperture, 24, is surrounded by a brush, 30, which is used as an applicator to apply the detergent composition and solvent to the item to be cleaned. The applicator is preferably associated with at least one aperture such that when the detergent composition and solvent exit the aperture, they immediately commingle with the applicator to allow convenient, accurate, and easy application of the detergent composition and solvent to the item to be cleaned. Nonlimiting examples of the applicator useful herein includes a brush, a roller ball, a sponge, a nozzle, bristles, and combinations thereof, of which a brush, and bristles are preferred. It is preferred that at least one applicator be utilized herein, preferably one or two applicators. The applicator may be made of any applicable material, such as plastics, fur, cloth, polymers, rubber, wooden materials, and combinations thereof. Preferred materials for the applicator include polyesters, polyethylene, polypropylene, plastics, and combinations thereof.<br>
If the applicator includes a brush or bristles, the brush/bristle strength and length may be tailored to the type of cleaning to be performed. For example, in cleaning fabrics, bristles which are too stiff may ham the fabrics to be cleaned, especially delicate fabrics such as silk. Accordingly, either longer bristles, or softer bristles are preferred. For fabrics, preferred brushes have a bristle strength of less than about 200 N/cm2, preferably less than about 150 N/cm2. Bristle strength is measured using the method of JIS S 3016, except that a press head speed of 12.5 mm/min, and a bristle area of about 5.5 cm2 are used; JIS S<br>
3016 is a Japanese Industrial Standard for measuring toothbrush bristle strength. The compression testing machine used herein is a Compression Tester, model YLM-5, made by Toyo Tester of Osaka, Japan. For non-fabric cleaning applications, or less sensitive surfaces, stiffer bristles may be desirable.<br>
In Fig. 1, the dispensing passage, 22, contains an optional neck portion, 32, which forms part of the dispensing passage, 18. The neck portion, 32, is disposed inwardly of the distal end, 20, i.e., between the distal end, 20, and the bottom of the housing, 12. The neck portion may be curved, as shown in Fig. 1, or may be straight (not shown).<br>
Fig. 2 shows a close-up cut away view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 2, the neck portion, 32, is curved and aligns the aperture, 24, along an aperture angle, a. If present, the aperture angle is measured between the vertical line drawn through the container (a-a), and a line going through and parallel to the orientation of the aperture (b-b). The aperture angle useful herein is of from about 90 degrees to about 180 degrees, and a preferred aperture angle useful herein is an obtuse angle of from about 120 degrees to about 150 degrees. It has been found that an aperture angle of less than 120 degrees becomes cumbersome to manufacture, while an aperture angle of greater than 150 degrees is inconvenient because it increases the likelihood of blockages forming. A more preferred aperture angle is from about 120 degrees to about 140 degrees.	<br>
In Fig. 2, the aperture, 24, contains an interior aperture edge, 34. In this embodiment, the aperture plug, 28, extends beyond the interior aperture edge, 34, and into the distal end, 20. As noted above, when the aperture cover, 26, is removably placed over the distal end, 20, the aperture plug, 28, helps to clear blockages from obstructing the flow of detergent composition and solvent (see Fig. 1 at 14) through the aperture, 24.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 2, the aperture, 24, is surrounded by a brush, 30, with which the detergent composition and solvent (Fig. 1 at 14) commingles upon exiting the container, 10. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that even if such detergent composition is not completely dissolved, and/or remains in a gel-like state after exiting the container, by commingling with an applicator, such as a brush, it may be easily applied to and rubbed onto the item to be cleaned. This allows the user to selectively apply a potion of the detergent composition and solvent to a specific place on the item, which in turn<br>
concentrates the cleaning power for the detergent composition and solvent to the specified area.<br>
Fig. 2 also shows a notch, 36, in the neck portion, 32, of the cap member, 16, and adjacent to the removable aperture cover, 26. The notch, 36, allows the user to press the edge of their finger, fingernail, etc., against the aperture cover, 26, in order to easily remove it from the cap member, 16. The aperture cover, 26, also contains an optional frictional surface, 38. Preferably, as shown in Fig. 2, the aperture cover contains a plurality of frictional surfaces, 38. The housing, the cap member, the neck portion, the aperture cover, or any other container component may contain at least one frictional surface to improve the user's grip, for aesthetic reasons, or for any other reason. For example, if detergent or fluid spills on the outside of the container, a frictional surface helps the user maintain their grip. Alternatively, the frictional surface may help the user to easily remove and replace the aperture cover. Nonlimiting examples of the preferred frictional surface useful herein include a ridge, a depression, a rubber grip, and combinations thereof. The frictional surface may be formed integrally with the container component(s), or added separately. A frictional surface is especially preferred on both the housing and the cap member, if present, because these portions of the container may become slippery during use. In a preferred embodiment, raised or lowered usage instructions serve the dual purpose of also acting as a frictional surface.<br>
The aperture cover may be attached to the neck portion, the cap member, and/or the housing via a variety of closures, such as the snap-type closure of Fig. 2. Other types of closures are also useful herein, and preferably form water-tight seals. Nonlimiting examples of a preferred closure is a screw-type closure, a snap-type closure, a hinge-type closure, a sliding closure, and combinations thereof. From a manufacturing standpoint, a snap-type closure, and a screw-type closure are preferred, as they are inexpensive to form, even if they are water-tight seals. An optional feature which may be included wherever a watertight seal is desired is an inner plug seal, a trigger seal, and/or any of many well-known contact-ring seals. These types of gasketless seals are surprisingly water-tight. Alternatively, a separately-formed, or an integrally-formed gasket-type seal may also be used herein. Fig. 2, at 40, shows an inner plug seal on the cap member, 16. The inner plug seal, if present, runs around substantially the entire inner circumference of a female member to be sealed, and is received by a<br>
reciprocal fitting on the male sealing member. Inner plug seals and gasket-type seals are preferred as they are inexpensive to form, and are surprisingly watertight.<br>
An inner plug seal is especially water-tight, if the female member to be sealed is formed of a softer or more resilient material than the reciprocal male member. Alternatively, the female member may be formed of a harder or less resilient material than the reciprocal male member. This combination of a harder and a softer material may also provide substantial additional advantages, such as a reduction in the amount of torque required to form a water-tight seal with a screw-type closure. A contact-ring seal (not shown), which runs along the inner surface of a female member and forms a seal with the very tip of the male member, is also preferred herein. Additional seals and closures useful herein are described as "Closures, Bottle and Jar," in The Wilev Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology." A. L. Brady and K. S. Marsh, editors, pp. 206-20, (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2nd Ed. 1997).<br>
Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the present invention, showing a container, 10, having a housing, 12, a cap member, 16, attached to the housing, 12, and an aperture cover, 26, attached to the cap member, 16. On the housing, 12, the cap member, 16, and the aperture cover, 26, are a plurality of frictional surfaces, 38. Also seen in Fig. 3 is an optional lip, 42, running along the circumference of the housing, for improving structural rigidity of the closure area. If the lip is placed on the outside of the housing, then it may also serve to catch drips as well as to act as a frictional surface.<br>
The container may be formed in a variety of shapes and sizes, preferably the shape and size of the housing allow the container to be easily, comfortably, and conveniently held in the hand. More preferably, the housing is shaped in an easy-to-form shape which reduces container fabrication costs. Such easy-to-form shapes include those having a circular cross-section (such as cylindrical shapes), a square or rectangular cross-section, an oval cross-section, and combinations thereof, and more preferably those having a circular cross-section. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that a cylindrical-shaped container having a circular cross-section with thin walls is especially preferred as it is easy and inexpensive to fabricate, provides good resiliency and squeezability, does not require mold timing-orientation during molding, does not require a specific orientation during use, and simultaneously balances significant<br>
structural benefits such as acceptable rigidity and consumer-desirable resiliency. Such circular cross-sectioned containers are also easily adapted to contain a water-tight, screw-type closure. The container shape may be tapered, or remain the same width throughout.<br>
Preferred container materials include plastics and polymers, flexible materials such as films and laminated papers, rubber, glass, metal, and combinations thereof. More preferred container materials include rubber, plastic, polyesters, and combinations thereof, and even more preferred container materials include polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and combinations thereof. Preferred production processes are blow molding, injection molding, injection blow molding, vacuum forming, thermoforming, and combinations thereof. The various individual container portions may be formed with different materials, and/or by different processes, as desired.<br>
Optional, but preferred characteristics of the container material include translucency, transparency, or opaqueness, easy formation to the desired shape(s), resistance to detergent solutions and applicable pH ranges, durability, coloration, and softness to allow the container to be added to the wash cycle without causing undue noise. It is highly preferred that the container material be transparent or translucent, to allow the user to visibly gauge the level of detergent composition and/or solvent. If the container is to be placed inside the wash cycle, then the material chosen should be both water resistant and temperature resistant to those temperatures at which detergent solutions are used, i.e., typically from about 5°C to about 60°C. Ideally, the container material selected should be resistant to temperatures ranging from below freezing up to above the temperatures at which clothes dryers operate. These optimal ranges may be relevant, for example, where consumers store cleaning supplies outside during the winter, and where the container may be transferred, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a clothes dryer.<br>
For convenient use, the housing which attaches to the cap member should be of sufficient width to easily add the detergent composition and solvent into the housing without spilling. The preferred size and shape of the housing depends upon many factors such as the type of detergent composition intended for use therein. The preferred detergent composition useful herein is typically selected from the group consisting of a granular detergent composition, a solid detergent composition, a detergent tablet composition, a liquid detergent composition, a<br><br>
gel-type detergent composition, a paste detergent composition, and combinations thereof, preferably a granular detergent composition, a detergent tablet composition, a gel-type detergent composition, a paste detergent composition, and combinations thereof. For example, in containers intended for use with granular detergent compositions, which usually come with some type of measuring device, e.g., a scoop or a cap, it is preferred that the housing be wide enough to accept a scoop and even a "heaped" scoop. Accordingly, preferred mouth sizes for such containers are from about 30 mm to about 120 mm, preferably from about 50 mm to about 105 mm, and more preferably from about 60 mm to about 95 mm in width, as measured at the widest point of the housing. Preferred housing sizes for containers for use with liquid, gel-type, tablet, paste detergent compositions are from about 20 mm to about 95 mm, preferably from about 35 mm to about 85 mm, and more preferably from about 45 mm to about 80 mm in width, as measured at the widest point of the housing. The preferred housing thickness is less than about 3 mm, more preferably less than about 1.5 mm, and even more preferably less than about 0.8 mm, for improved resiliency and squeezability.<br>
It is preferred that the housing and the container be of a reusable type, and the design should therefore facilitate easy reuse, refilling, and cleaning. It is also preferable that the container be shaped and balanced such that it may remain standing upright, without leaking, when placed on a flat surface.<br>
The container of the present invention is not limited to use with a detergent composition and a solvent, but may also be used to apply, for example, a bleach composition, a gel composition, and a colorant composition. Accordingly, in the present description, any of these other compositions may replace the words "detergent composition". Preferably a composition selected from the group consisting of a bleaching composition, a detergent composition, and a mixture thereof are used in the container described herein, and more preferably a detergent composition is used in the container described herein.<br>

The typical solvent useful herein to predissolve the detergent composition will be water, such as tap water, wash water, or water from other sources. However, other solvents may also be useful herein, as desired, such as alcohol, water, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Another optional feature is a pressure-release mechanism which allows any pressure built-up inside of the housing, e.g., from an oxygen bleach, to slowly equalize with the ambient pressure. This can be achieved through a small release valve, a water-tight, but not-airtight seal, a threaded aperture cover which requires many rotations to release, or any means known in the art.<br>
Preferably, when a predetermined amount of a detergent composition and a predetermined amount of a solvent are placed in the container, they form a fluid having a viscosity of less than about 500 centipoise (cP), preferably less than about 250 cP, as measured at about 21 °C, by means of a Brookfield Viscometer at a shear rate of 1.0 rpm. Centipoise is the cgs-metric system unit of viscosity and has the dimensions of dyne-seconds per square centimeter or grams per centimeter-second. Preferably, the dispensing passage size and/or aperture size is coordinated to this viscosity such that when no manual pressure is exerted on the container, and the container is in a dispensing orientation, the fluid flow rate through the passage is a rate from about 0 mL/min to about 300 mL/min, preferably from about 0 ml/min to less than about 100 mL/min, and more<br>
preferably from about 0 mL/min to less than about 25 mL/min. However, if the container and/or housing is formed of a resilient material, manual pressure exerted upon the container and/or housing may cause the flow rate to increase beyond 300 mL/min.<br>
Another preferred optional feature is at least one level indicator which informs the user as to how much detergent, and/or solvent should be added to the container. In a preferred embodiment, the level indicator is molded onto the housing during the production process. In a preferred embodiment, the container has more than one level indicator, preferably more than two level indicators. In a more preferred embodiment, the container has a set of level indicators for treating normally-soiled items, and a separate set of level indicators for treating heavily-soiled items. The level indicators may also serve the dual purpose of acting as a frictionai surface. The level indicators may serve as a set of usage instructions for using the container, and/or the detergent composition and solvent in combination. Accordingly, a highly preferred embodiment of the container herein contains usage instructions, either actually on the container, or otherwise provided with the container, e.g., as part of a kit. Preferably, the level indicator(s), usage instructions, etc. are printed, silk-screened, etched, molded into, or otherwise attached to the container, via, for example, a sticker, or label.<br>
Examples of the invention are set forth hereinafter by way of illustration and are not intended to be in any way limiting of the invention, as many variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is described in Fig. 1, and has the following additional characteristics: The housing is a cylindrical housing having a circular cross-section, which is formed of an injection-molded translucent polypropylene and has a plurality of frictional surfaces on the outside thereof. The housing is transparent such that the user can easily and quickly judge the level of detergent and solvent therein. The housing is about 0.8 mm thick, and is slightly resilient so as to allow a user to increase the flow rate of detergent and solvent through the aperture, by squeezing the container housing during use. This flow control method is easy and intuitive for the user. The housing has a cap member attached thereto. The housing is about 65 mm in diameter where it meets the cap member, and tapers to about 55 mm at the base of the housing. This tapered cylindrical housing has a circular cross-section throughout, and is inexpensive to fabricate. The housing readily maintains a round shape and easily join with the cap member to form a water-tight seal. The housing contains a plurality of level indicators to indicate the amount of detergent composition and solvent to be added thereto.<br>
The cap member is formed of opaque high density polyethylene which is slightly softer than the polypropylene of the rest of the housing. The housing and the cap member join together with a screw-type closure and contain an inner plug seal. The combination of this softer cap member and a harder housing allows the formation of a water-tight seal without additional rubber or formed plastic gaskets, or expensive closures, such as those which require very close manufacturing tolerances in order to prevent leaking. A round brush and a flow restriction portion are formed as a single piece of high density polyethylene blended with low density polyethylene, which is permanently fastened to the distal end of the cap member. The flow restriction portion contains a single round aperture of about 2.8 mm in diameter in the center of the brush (and therefore an aperture area of about 6.1 mm2). The neck portion is curved, and aligns the aperture at an aperture angle of about 135 degrees. Adjacent to the brush on the exterior of the cap member is a notch which allows a user to easily remove the aperture cover, discussed below. The cap member has a plurality of frictional surfaces on the exterior thereof, to allow a user to easily seal and unseal the cap member and the housing.<br>
A round aperture cover formed of translucent polypropylene covers the aperture and brush. The aperture cover contains an aperture plug which extends through the aperture, and about 1 mm past the interior aperture edge into the distal end of the cap member. The aperture plug and the aperture form a watertight seal, as does the aperture cover and the cap member. The aperture cover has a plurality of frictional surfaces which allow a user to easily grip the aperture cover and remove it from the cap member. The container does not contain a filter.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
About 25 g of the granular detergent compositions below are added to a container as described in Example 1, along with about 60 ml_ tap water. The detergent and water are vigorously shaken for 1 minute, and used to pre-treat specific areas of a fabric before laundering in a regular laundering cycle.<br>
