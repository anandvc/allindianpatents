The additives of the present invention are for example applied to textiles in a dyeing or printing process, or in a finishing process. For instance, the additives may be applied as part of a dye formulation. The additives may be applied to textiles for example in an ink-jet printing process. The additives are for example applied as part of an aqueous dye solution or printing paste. They may be applied in an exhaust method or dyeing by the padder dyeing method, in which the textiles are impregnated with aqueous dye solutions, which may contain salts, and the dyes and additives are fixed, after an alkali treatment or in the presence of alkali, if appropriate with the action of heat or by storage at room temperature for several hours. After fixing, the dyeings or prints are rinsed thoroughly with cold and hot water, if appropriate with the addition of an agent which has a dispersing action and promotes diffusion of the non-fixed portions.<br>
The dye or ink formulations for application to textiles may comprise further customary additves, for example surfactants, antifoams, antimicrobials and the like, for example as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,281,339, 6,353,094 and 6,323,327, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
