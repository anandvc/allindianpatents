Gary L. Long<br>
This application incorporates by reference and claims priority to US Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/310,365 "Locally -Propelled Intraluminal Device with<br>
Cable Loop Track and Method of Use" filed December 5, 2002.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a medical device, and more particularlv to a<br>
medical device that can be advanced along a track located within a lumen of a<br>
patient's body.<br>
Background<br>
A physician typically accesses and visualizes tissue within a patient's<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a long, flexible endoscope. For the upper GI, a<br>
physician may insert a gastroscope into the sedated patient's mouth to examine and<br>
treat tissue in the esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum. For the lower GI, a<br>
physician may insert a colonoscope through the sedated patient's anus to examine the<br>
rectum and colon. Some endoscopes have a working channel, typically about 2.5-<br>
3.5mm in diameter, extending from a port in the handpiece to the distal tip of the<br>
flexible shaft. A physician may insert medical instruments into the working channel<br>
to help diagnose or treat tissues within the patient. Physicians commonly take tissue<br>
biopsies from the mucosal lining of the GI tract using a flexible, biopsy forceps<br>
through the working channel of the endoscope.<br>
Insertion of a flexible endoscope, especially into the colon, is usually a very<br>
time-consuming and uncomfortable procedure for the patient, even when sedated<br>
with drugs. A physician often needs several minutes to push a flexible endoscope<br>
through the convoluted sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending portions of<br><br>
END 894cip<br>
the colon. The physician may diagnose and/or treat tissues within the colon either<br>
during insertion or removal of the endoscope. Often the flexible endoscope "loops"<br>
within the colon, such as at the sigmoid colon or at the splenic flexure of the colon,<br>
so that it becomes difficult to further advance the endoscope along the colon. When<br>
a loop is formed, the force exerted to push the scope stretches the mesentery and<br>
causes pain for the patient. Depending on the anatomy of the patient and the skill of<br>
the physician in manipulating the flexible endoscope, some portions of the colon<br>
may be unexamined, thus increasing the risk of undiagnosed disease.<br>
Given® Engineering LTD, Yoqneam, Israel sells a device in the U.S. called<br>
the M2A™ Swallowable Imaging Capsule. The device contains a tiny video camera,<br>
battery, and transmitter. It is propelled through the gastrointestinal tract by natural<br>
peristalsis. The device is currently used for diagnostic purposes and passes through<br>
the intestinal tract with a velocity determined by the natural, peristaltic action of the<br>
patient's body. World Publication No. WO 0108548A1 filed by C. Mosse, et al.<br>
describes a self-propelling device adapted to travel through a passage having walls<br>
containing contractile tissue. The applicants disclose that the device is particularly<br>
useful as an enteroscope and may also carry objects such as feeding tubes, guide<br>
wires, physiological sensors or conventional endoscopes within the gut. A summary<br>
of other alternatives to push endoscopy can be found in "Technical Advances and<br>
Experimental Devices for Enteroscopy" by C. Mosse, et al, published in<br>
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America, Volume 9, Number 1, January<br>
1999: pp. 145-161.<br>
Scientists and Engineers continue to seek improved methods and devices for<br>
accessing, diagnosing and/or treating tissre within body lumens uncluding the GI<br>
tract.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Applicant has recognized the desirability of a low cost, potentially disposable<br>
medical device which may provide physicians with a desirable alternative to using a<br>
conventional, reusable, flexible endoscope. Eliminating the need for the operator to<br>
make constant adjustment of the articulation controls of an endoscope may reduce<br>
the skill required to intubate the device, allowing operators other than physicians to<br><br><br>
use the device. This is advantageous because gastroenterologists currently do not<br>
have the capacity to handle ail of the patients that need colonoscopies, so equipment<br>
that enables other staff, such as nurses, to help with the procedure could increase the<br>
capacity and allow gastroenterologists to treat more patients.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a medical device<br>
comprising an elongate flexible member which can be advanced through a body<br>
lumen on a track. The track can have a loop portion which is advanced distally of<br>
the flexible member, and the member is then advanced along the track. The flexible<br>
member can include visualization means, light means, and channels for fluids (gas or<br>
liquid) and instruments.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of moving a medical apparatus<br>
through a patient's body, such as through the GI tract. The method can comprise the<br>
steps of positioning a portion of the medical device within the body lumen;<br>
advancing a length of track distally of the medical device; and advancing the medical<br>
device on the track to move distally within the lumen. The medical device can be<br>
advanced distally while simultaneously retracting a portion of the track proximally.<br>
The invention can be used to assist in diagnosis and treatment of tissue,<br>
including the placement of medical instruments (including without limitation<br>
balloons, dilators, tissue graspers, tissue cutting devices, tissue stapling devices,<br>
tissue staining or treatment devices, vessel ligation devices, and tissue ablation<br>
devices) at a desired tissue site.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
By way of example, the present invention is illustrated and described for<br>
application in the colon of the lower GI tract of a human patient. However, the<br>
present invention is applicable for use in the body lumens of other hollow organs in<br>
humans and in other mammals.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a medical device 70. The medical device 70 can include a<br>
movable apparatus, such as a capsule 80 shaped and sized for movement through a<br>
body lumen, a compressible sleeve 40, a fixing plate 50, an umbilicus 30, a cable 25,<br>
a video unit 72, and a handpiece 20.<br>
Capsule 80 generally has a leading end 64 that is smooth for atraumatic<br>
passage through a tortuous path of a gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as a colon. In<br>
one embodiment of capsule 80, leading end 64 is hemispherical and a trailing end 65<br>
is flat to accept the contents contained in umbilicus 30. Other shapes of capsule 80<br>
are possible, such as but not limited to tapered, cylindrical, ovoid, or egg-shaped<br>
configurations, to facilitate navigation through the colon.<br>
Compressible sleeve 40 can extend from trailing end 65 of capsule 80 to<br>
fixing plate 50. Fixing plate 50 can be anchored to the patient with adhesive. Other<br>
methods of attachment to the patient include, but are not limited to glue, tape, or a<br><br>
close-fitting wrap. Suture or staples may also be used, but are less desirable because<br>
of the pain involved in their placement or removal. In applications related to the<br>
lower GI tract, fixing plate 50 can extend into the patient's anus. A secure<br>
attachment of plate 50 to the patients body or other fixture is desirable so that fixing<br>
plate 50 provides an anchor, thereby enhancing movement of capsule 80 deeper<br>
into the colon.<br>
The proximal portion of umbilicus 30 can extend outside the body and can be<br>
connected to equipment, including video unit 72 and handpiece 20. The distal<br>
portion of umbilicus 30 can be connected to trailing end 65 of capsule 80 inside the<br>
colon. Umbilicus 30 can extend through openings in plate 50 and sleeve 40, and<br>
umbilicus 30 can slide through the openings relative to plate 50 and sleeve 40.<br>
Umbilicus 30 is preferably made from a lightweight, flexible, plastic, multilumen<br>
tube. For example, umbilicus 30 may have four lumens: a 3mm lumen for a working<br>
channel 36, a 3mm diameter lumen for the wiring assembly 34, a 5mm diameter<br>
lumen to receive a drive cable 32, and a 3mm lumen to receive cable 25. Many<br>
other sizes and combinations of lumens are possible. Umbilicus 30 may also<br>
comprise separate thin-wall, flexible plastic tubes that are bundled together with<br>
straps, shrink-wrap, or the like.<br>
Cable 25 can provide a track on which capsule 80 is supported and propelled.<br>
Cable 25 may be constructed in numerous shapes, including a braided strand of<br>
fibers, a coated wire, a flat band, or may have a constant cross sectional shape<br>
including circular, triangular, or rectangular. Cable 25 may include a periodic and/or<br>
non periodic pattern of features that assist in traction, such as teeth, holes, or<br>
grooves. Cable 25 may be made from any suitable material, including without<br>
limitation one or more metals including steel, nitinoi, aluminum, or titanium, and<br>
have diameters including, but not limited to, 0.5mm to 2.5mm.<br>
One suitable material for use as a cable 25 is a guidwire having a nitinoi<br>
core with a diameter of about 0.021 inch to about 0.025 inch surrounded by a<br>
stainless steel wire coil having a diameter of about 0.008 inch. The overall diameter<br>
can be between about 0.037 inch and about 0.041 inch, and the stainless steel coil<br>
may be soldered or otherwise attached at about 50 cm intervals to hold the stainless<br>
steel coil in place relative to the nitinoi core. Another suitable material for use as a<br><br>
cable 25 is a guidwire marketed as Elite Protector™ Elite 480 wire guide available<br>
from Wilson-Cook Medical, Inc. of Winston Salem, NC, and having a diameter of<br>
about 0.035 inch.<br>
A proximal portion of cable 25 extends outside the body, so that an operator<br>
can handle it. Cable 25 is fed through umbilicus 30, though capsule 80, to form a<br>
cable loop 54 ahead (distally) of capsule 80. As described below, cable loop 54 can<br>
be used to navigate around the tortuous path of the colon, eliminating the need for<br>
the operator to make constant adjustment of the articulation controls of an<br>
endoscope, thus reducing the skill required to intubate the device. As alternatives to<br>
cable 25, other suitable track configurations can be used, including without<br>
limitation flexible rails, chains, slides, and belts.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 1, video unit 72 supplies power to a lighting device 96<br>
(FIG. 9), and processes video images taken by a visualization device 95 (FIG. 9) in<br>
capsule 80 as it moves through the colon so that the operator is able to view the<br>
inside surface of the lumen. Lighting device 96 may include a bulb or LED (Light<br>
Emitting Diode) contained within capsule 80, or include a fiberoptic, a light pipe, or<br>
a lens of a light source contained in video unit 72. One example of a bulb that could<br>
be located in capsule 80 is Xenon #724 from Carley Lamps (Torrance, CA).<br>
Visualization device 95 may be a CMOS (Complementary Metallic Oxide<br>
Semiconductor) or CCD (Charged Coupled Device) camera, either of which are<br>
commercially available in sizes adaptable to use in capsule 80. For example, a<br>
CMOS chip such as #OV7620 from Omni vision Technologies (Sunnyvale, CA)<br>
could be used. Wiring assembly 34 transfers signals between video unit 72 and<br>
lighting device 96 and between video unit 72 and visualization device 95.<br>
Handpiece 20 provides a motion control 58 to activate the propulsion of<br>
capsule 80 along cable 25. Capsule 80 can be propelled along cable 25 in any<br>
suitable manner. In one embodiment, handpiece 20 contains a motor and operably<br>
controls a flexible drive cable 32, which is constructed to transmit torque, to operate<br>
a propulsion mechanism 44 (FIG. 7) located inside capsule 80 to move medical<br>
device 70 further into the colon. In one embodiment, motion control 58 has a<br>
forward and reverse setting to change the rotation of a motor within handpiece 20 so<br>
that capsule 80 moves in a forward and backward direction along cable 25.<br><br>
The proximal portion of working channel 36 extends out of the body to a<br>
location near handpiece 20, so that the operator can pass medical instruments in and<br>
out of the colon numerous times. The distal portion of working channel 36 extends<br>
through capsule 80 to an opening in the outer surface of the leading edge 64 of<br>
capsule 80. Medical instruments can be inserted into the proximal end of working<br>
channel 36 and be directed through working channel to the opening in the outer<br>
surface of the capsule 80 without removing the capsule 80 from the body lumen.<br>
Accordingly, the operator can access lumen tissue adjacent the capsule 80 with the<br>
medical instruments as the capsule is moved through the lumen. Medical<br>
instruments which can be directed through a working channel include without<br>
limitation tissue graspers, staplers, cutters, clip appliers, tissue ablation devices,<br>
tissue staining devices, and devices for dispensing pharmaceutical agents.<br>
FIG. 2 shows medical device 70 of FIG. 1 including a cable spool 74 outside<br>
the body, and cable loop 54 ahead (distal) of capsule 80. Cable spool 74 stores a<br>
proximal portion of cable 25, and may be used to unwind an additional length of<br>
cable 25 through umbilicus 30 and a sliding channel 90, to increase the size of cable<br>
loop 54 ahead of capsule 80 in the colon.<br>
Cable loop 54 is formed ahead of capsule 80 from a middle portion of cable<br>
25. One end of cable loop 54 is formed by cable extending distally outward from a<br>
sliding channel 90, and the other end (the return end) of cable loop 54 is formed by<br>
cable extending proximally into an opening in the outer surface of the capsule 80,<br>
where the cable is fed though (and is engaged by) a gripping channel 91 in the<br>
capsule 80. The cable extends from the gripping channel 91 proximally through<br>
compressible sleeve 40 (outside of umbilicus 30) to cable anchor 52. This<br>
arrangement allows an operator to feed an additional portion of cable 25 through<br>
sliding channel 90 to increase the size of cable loop 54 (other end of loop is held by<br>
gripping channel 91). As cable loop 54 increases in size, it "unfurls" inside the<br>
lumen directly ahead of capsule 80, and generally conforms to bends or curves in the<br>
lumen, thereby laying a track along and/or distal to the bend on which to propel the<br>
capsule. This arrangement of cable loop 54 can be advantageous in simplifying the<br>
process of navigating the colon. The operator can simply add length to the loop<br>
portion of the cable to negotiate bends and turns in the GI tract, rather than trying to<br>
manipulate the end of a guide tube or guide wire through the three dimensional<br><br>
curvature of the lumen. The operator then uses motion control 58 (FIG. 1) to<br>
advance capsule 80 in a forward direction along the track (the cable loop 54) to<br>
move the capsule 80 through the bend in colon.<br>
FIG. 3 shows medical device 70 positioned in the colon. Cable loop 54 is<br>
introduced first, with capsule 80, compressible sleeve 40, and fixing plate 50 trailing<br>
behind it. Fixing plate 50 can then be securely affixed to the anus or other suitable<br>
location with adhesive or by other means, creating an anchor point relative to the<br>
patient.<br>
Cable loop 54 is shown deployed around a bend in the sigmoid colon 100.<br>
The operator monitors progress of capsule 80 and cable loop 54 by viewing video<br>
unit 72 (FIG. 1), which displays images taken by visualization device 95 (FIG. 9).<br>
When cable loop 54 reaches a sufficient orientation to navigate a bend in the colon,<br>
capsule 80 is propelled a short distance along cable 25 by propulsion mechanism 44<br>
(FIG. 7) under control of the operator who activates motion control 58 (FIG. 1).<br>
This process shortens the length of cable loop 54 ahead (distal) of capsule 80.<br>
To further advance capsule 80 deeper into the colon, the operator slides more<br>
of the proximal portion of cable 25 through umbilicus 30 and sliding channel 90 to<br>
again increase the size of cable loop 54 ahead of capsule 80. This procedure lays<br>
additional track through additional bends that are deeper in the colon, such as the left<br>
splenic flexure 112 or the hepatic flexure 110. The operator continues to slide<br>
cable 25 and activate motion control 58 (FIG. 1), in sequence, to incrementally<br>
move capsule 80 through the descending colon 102, transverse colon 104, and<br>
ascending colon 106 to cecum 108.<br>
As capsule 80 advances along cable 25,compressible sleeve 40 begins to<br>
uncompress (increase in length) so that a smooth, uninterrupted surface is<br>
maintained from fixing plate 50 to capsule 80.<br>
FIG. 4 is a detailed view of medical device 70 generally comprising capsule<br>
80, compressible sleeve 40, fixing plate 50, and umbilicus 30. In this embodiment,<br>
capsule 80 is comprised of three sections (a 1st section 77, a 2nd section 78, and a 3rd<br>
section 79) for assembly and contains propulsion mechanism 44 (FIG. 7). Other<br>
embodiments with a different arrangement or number of sections, or other locations<br>
of propulsion mechanism 44 are possible. Visualization device 95 (FIG. 9) and<br><br>
lighting device 96 (FIG. 9), located near leading end 64 of capsule 80, communicate<br>
with video unit 72 through wiling assembly 34 to allow visualization of the inside of<br>
the lumen in the vicinity of capsule 80. Working channel 36 allows an operator to<br>
repeatedly pass medical instruments in and out of the patient to perform treatment in<br>
the vicinity of capsule 80, without removing capsule 80 from the body lumen.<br>
Compressible sleeve 40 can perform at least two functions. First,<br>
compressible sleeve can provide a smooth, uninterrupted, flexible connection<br>
between fixing plate 50 and capsule 80 as it advances deeper into the colon, to<br>
thereby assist in protecting the body lumen from damage as medical device 70<br>
navigates the colon. Additionally, compressible sleeve 40 can act to radially confine<br>
a portion of cable 25 located between gripping channel 91 and cable anchor 52 to<br>
assist in the propulsion of capsule 80 in a forward direction deeper into the colon.<br>
By radially confining a portion of cable 25 between gripping channel 91 and anchor<br>
52, the sleeve 40 can assist in preventing a secondary loop from forming in cable 25<br>
between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50 (prevents formation of a cable loop behind<br>
(proximal) of capsule 80). Compressible sleeve 40 may be made from any suitable<br>
material, including without limitation ePTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene), or<br>
other suitable flexible material that stretch or otherwise increase in length to<br>
accommodate the increased distance between the anchor 52 and the capsule 80 as the<br>
capsule moves deeper into the GI tract.<br>
Propulsion mechanism 44 uses a portion of cable 25 inside gripping channel<br>
91 to propel capsule 80 further into the colon. As motion control 58 (FIG. 1) is<br>
activated, propulsion mechanism 44 moves a portion of cable 25, initially<br>
comprising cable loop 54, back through gripping channel 91 to a position between<br>
capsule 80 and fixing plate 50. Therefore, the length of cable 25 between capsule 80<br>
and fixing plate 50 increases. Because cable 25 is anchored to the patient by fixing<br>
plate 50 and radially confined by compressible sleeve 40, cable 25 supplies an axial<br>
force to counteract a traction force applied by propulsion mechanism 44, resulting in<br>
capsule 80 being propelled further into the colon.<br>
The location of propulsion mechanism 44 inside capsule 80 is advantageous<br>
because it locally propels capsule 80 a short distance from a position already within<br>
the colon. This decreases the forces needed to push an entire length of endoscope or<br>
other long flexible extension through the tortuous colon. However, other<br><br>
mechanisms or locations for mechanisms may be used to accomplish the propulsion.<br>
For example, propulsion mechanism 44 can be positioned anywhere that allows the<br>
length of cable 25 between fixing plate 50 and capsule 80 to vary in length,<br>
including a separate pod between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50, a separate housing<br>
attached to fixing plate 50, or contained within a portion of fixing plate 50.<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross section of medical device 70 taken at line 5-5 of FIG. 1,<br>
showing one embodiment of fixing plate 50 having a relatively large diameter sized<br>
for securing it to a patient's anus. Cable anchor 52 is shown as a rigid attachment to<br>
fixing plate 50, so that the distal portion of cable 25 does not move relative to fixing<br>
plate 50. Centering attachment 56 holds umbilicus 30 in the center of fixing plate 50<br>
for alignment through the anus into the colon.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a detailed view of the cross section of umbilicus 30 from FIG.<br>
5, including a lumen for cable 25, a lumen for wiring assembly 34, a lumen for drive<br>
cable 32, and working channel 36. FIG. 6 indicates the relative positions and sizes<br>
of these lumens and elements in this embodiment of umbilicus 30. Numerous other<br>
sizes and arrangements are possible. For example, additional working channels<br>
could be added, working channel 36 could be sized larger to allow for passage of<br>
larger instruments, or the lumen for drive cable 32 could be smaller. In general, it is<br>
advantageous to have a small diameter and lightweight umbilicus 30 so that capsule<br>
80 has as little drag as possible when advancing through the colon.<br>
FIG. 7 is an isometric view of one embodiment of compressible sleeve 40<br>
and capsule 80 including sliding channel 90, gripping channel 91, working channel<br>
36, and propulsion mechanism 44 including a first miter gear 82, a second miter gear<br>
83, a pulley 86, and a pulley grip 87. This illustration shows the relative positions<br>
of these elements in three-dimensional space.<br>
Propulsion mechanism 44 works by changing the length of cable 25 between<br>
capsule 80 and fixing plate 50, which has been secured to the patient's body. In this<br>
manner, capsule 80 can move deeper into the colon when this length of cable 25<br>
increases, and moves backward out of the colon when this length decreases. In this<br>
embodiment, propulsion mechanism 44 comprises a gear system described below<br>
contained within capsule 80, but other locations and systems are possible<br>
FIG. 8 is a cross sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 8-8 of FIG. 7,<br>
showing an arrangement of gears in this embodiment of propulsion mechanism 44<br><br>
(FIG. 7). The distal portion of drive cable 32 passes through trailing end 65 of<br>
capsule 80 and coaxially connects to first miter gear 82. Drive cable 32 is<br>
constructed to transmit torque from handpiece 20 to first miter gear 82, so that when<br>
the operator activates motion control 58 (FIG. 1), first miter gear 82 rotates around<br>
an axis collinear with drive cable 32.<br>
In the embodiment shown, miter gears 82 and 83 are supported in the capsule<br>
80 (such as by a suitable bearing or bushing) for rotation about their respective axes<br>
of rotation, which are generally perpendicular to one another. The teeth of first miter<br>
gear 82 and second miter gear 83 are each cut at a 45-degree angle, so that rotational<br>
motion around the axis of drive cable 32 is converted to rotation around another axis<br>
90 degrees to the first. Therefore, when the operator activates motion control 58,<br>
first miter gear 82 rotates about its axis of rotation, and transmits torque to second<br>
miter gear 83, causing gear 83 to rotate about its axis of rotation.<br>
Pulley 86 is coaxially coupled to second miter gear 83, and pully 86 is<br>
supported for rotation about the axis of rotation of miter gear 83. When second<br>
miter gear 83 rotates, pulley 86 rotates with gear 83 around its axis of rotation. A<br>
portion of cable 25 contained within gripping channel 91 is in contact with pulley<br>
86. Gripping channel 91 and pulley grip 87 act in concert to prevent slippage and<br>
apply a traction force from pulley 86 to cable 25, as pulley 86 rotates. In a fashion<br>
similar to a train wheel propelling a locomotive along a railroad track, pulley 86<br>
propels capsule 80 along cable 25. The result of this motion increases the length of<br>
cable 25 between capsule 80 and fixing plate 50 to propel capsule 80 further into the<br>
colon.<br>
FIG. 9 is a sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 9-9 of FIG. 8. It shows<br>
the relative positions of visualization device 95, lighting device 96, cable 25, and<br>
pulley 86 within capsule 80. In this embodiment, wiring assembly 34 divides into<br>
two bundles before it passes through trailing end 65 of capsule 80. One bundle<br>
communicates with lighting device 96, and the other bundle communicates with<br>
visualization device 95. Lighting device 96 shines light to illuminate the region of<br>
the lumen in the vicinity of capsule 80. Visualization device 95 transmits images<br>
taken at this location back through wiring assembly 34 to video unit 72 for the<br>
operator to view.<br><br>
FIG. 10 is a cross sectional view of capsule 80 taken at line 10-10 of FIG. 9.<br>
As shown in this view gripping channel 91 is positioned and aligned so as to direct<br>
cable 25 into the pulley grip 86, and pulley grip 86 holds cable 25 in contact with<br>
pulley 86. Sliding channel 90 is also shown in a position within the GI tract which is<br>
free of obstructions (e.g. sharp curves or bends in the colon) so that the operator can<br>
slide cable 25 in a forward direction to increase the size of cable loop 54 (FIG. 2)<br>
ahead of capsule 80. This embodiment shows wiring assembly 34 split into two<br>
bundles, one bundle on either side of first miter gear 82. One of the bundles<br>
connects to visualization device 95, and the other bundle connects to illuminating<br>
device 96.<br>
Generally, medical device 70 is propelled through the colon under control of<br>
the operator for examination and treatment of sites within the lumen. Medical<br>
device 70 is placed into a patient's colon through the anus. Fixing plate 50 is affixed<br>
to the patient at this location. The operator advances a proximal portion of cable 25<br>
through umbilicus 30 and sliding channel 90 to increase the size of cable loop 54<br>
ahead of capsule 80. As described above, this process provides a path around the<br>
tortuous bends of the colon for capsule 80 to follow.<br>
While viewing video unit 72, the operator sees the inside of the lumen in the<br>
vicinity of capsule 80. Motion control 58 of handpiece 20 is activated to advance<br>
capsule 80 along cable 25, moving it deeper into the colon. To further advance<br>
capsule 80, the operator again feeds cable 25 to further increase the size of cable<br>
loop 54, and again activates motion control 58. These steps are repeated until<br>
capsule 80 reaches a depth deemed sufficient by an operator, which is cecum 108 in<br>
many cases. At any time during the procedure, the operator may introduce and<br>
remove medical instruments through working channel 36 to treat a site in the patient.<br>
Medical device 70 is therefore useful for diagnosis as well as therapy.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates a medical device 210 according to another embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Medical device 210 includes an elongate, flexible member<br>
230 extending distally from a handpiece 220. Flexible member 230 can be attached,<br>
directly or indirectly, to handpiece 220, and can be in the form of an umbilicus. By<br>
"flexible" it is meant that the member 230 has sufficient bending flexibility to allow<br>
the member 230 to be inserted into and advanced along a body lumen, such as the GI<br><br>
tract, without trauma to the patient. Member 230 is elongate in the sense that it has a<br>
length sufficient to permit a proximal end 232 of the member 230 associated with<br>
handpiece 220 to be positioned outside the body, or near the entrance to the body<br>
lumen, while a distal end 234 of the member 230 is advanced into the body lumen.<br>
In one embodiment, the flexible member 230 can have a length of at least about 36<br>
inches, and more particularly for use in the colon, a length of at least about 100<br>
inches. Flexible member 230 can have an outer diameter of between about 0.1 and<br>
about 1.0 inches to be positionable and advancable within the GI tract. In one<br>
embodiment, flexible member 230 can be in the form of a catheter, or have a<br>
catheter-like configuration, and can have an outer diameter of between about 4-6<br>
mm, more particularly about 5 mm.<br>
Flexible member 230 can include an outer sheath 236 which extends along<br>
substantially the full length of flexible member 230. A suitable sheath can be made<br>
of a thin, flexible polymeric film or other suitable flexible material. One suitable<br>
sheath material is porous teflon tubing (PTFE) having a thickness of about 0.02<br>
inches. A suitable material is manufactured by International Polymer Engineering of<br>
Tempe Arizona.<br>
In Figure 11, a portion of the sheath 236 at the distal end 234 of the flexible<br>
member 230 is shown in phantom to reveal internal features of the flexible member<br>
230 and components associated with the distal end 234 of flexible member 230.<br>
Flexible member 230 includes a track guide for receiving a track 250 upon which the<br>
flexible member 230 can be advanced. In Figure 11 the track guide is shown in the<br>
form of two track guide tubes 242 and 244. Track 250 is received in track guide<br>
tubes 242 and 244, and can slide within tubes 242 and 244. Track guide tubes are<br>
disposed within the sheath 236, and can extend from proximal guide tube ends<br>
associated with the handpiece 220 to distal ends associated with the distal end of<br>
flexible member 230. In Figure 11, the distal ends of the track guide tubes are<br>
shown cut at a bevel angle to accommodate the track 250 extending from the flexible<br>
member 230 at an angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the flexible member<br>
230.<br>
Track guide tubes 242 and 244 can be joined, directly or indirectly, in any<br>
suitable manner (e.g. with adhesive, elastic bands, ultrasonic bonding) to the sheath<br>
236 and/or to handpiece 220 so that the tubes 242, 244, the sheath 236, and the<br><br>
handpiece 220 move together. Track guide tubes 242 and 244 can also fit tightly in<br>
sheath 236 and can be fixed to sheath 236 at either end by heat shrink tubing (not<br>
shown).<br>
A visualization device and a light source can also be associated with the<br>
distal end of the flexible member 230. In Figure 11 and Figure 12, an optical fiber<br>
320 extends from a light source 324, through handpiece 220 and through flexible<br>
member 230 to terminate at the distal end of flexible member 230. Optical fiber 320<br>
carries light from light source 324 to illuminate lumen tissue adjacent the distal end<br>
of flexible member 230. A camera 420 and associated camera optics 424 can be<br>
disposed at the distal end of the flexible member 230. A camera can include built in<br>
optics and electronics, and can include CCD or CMOS capability. A suitable camera<br>
is an MVC-Snake-1 camera manufactured by Micro Video Products having a self<br>
contained CCD camera with built in optics and electronics. Alternatively, a CMOS<br>
camera such as one manufactured by Welch Allyn of Schenectady New York could<br>
be used. Signal cable 426 extends proximally from camera 420 through flexible<br>
member 230 and handpiece 220 to provide a signal to a monitor 428 or other<br>
suitable receiver/recorder.<br>
Flexible member 230 can also include various channels/passageways for<br>
conveying gases, liquids, or working devices from a point outside the patient to the<br>
tissue adjacent the distal end 234 of flexible member 230. Referring to Figures 11<br>
and 12, a vacuum tube 600 can extend through flexible member 230 and handpiece<br>
220 to be in communication with a vacuum source 620 for providing vacuum to the<br>
distal end of flexible member 230. Likewise, a fluid tube 700 can extend through<br>
member 230 and handpiece 220 to a supply 720 of fluid (e.g water, saline solution,<br>
lubricating fluids). Figure 12 also shows the opening of a working channel tube 800<br>
at the distal end of flexible member 230. Working channel tube 800 can extend<br>
through member 230 and handpiece 800 to receive a medical instrument 900. For<br>
instance, once the distal end of flexible member 230 is positioned at a desired<br>
location in the body lumen, a medical instrument 900, such as one having a forceps<br>
end 902 as shown in Figure 11, can be introduced through channel tube 800 to<br>
access tissue adjacent the distal end of flexible member 230. In Figure 11 and 12, a<br>
band 500 is shown holding the optical fiber 320 and tubes 600, 700, and 800 against<br>
camera 420.<br><br>
Track 250 can extend the length of flexible member 230. In Figure 11, Track<br>
250 is shown to include first and second ends 252 and 254, and a loop portion 256<br>
disposed along the track intermediate the first and second ends 252 and 254. Loop<br>
portion 256 is disposed distally of the distal end of flexible member 230. First and<br>
second ends 252 and 254 can extend proximally from the handpiece 220. If desired,<br>
the ends of the track extending proximally from the handpiece 220 can be wound,<br>
coiled, or otherwise supported on a suitable spool or receiver to prevent tangling of<br>
the ends 252 and 254. The track 250 extends in a generally continuous manner<br>
distally of the flexible member 230 (there are no track ends in the lumen distal of the<br>
flexible member 230).<br>
First and second ends can be manually manipulated by an operator's hands<br>
to advance either end 252 or 254 toward handpiece 220 to advance the track 250<br>
through flexible member 230, to thereby enlarge the loop portion 256. Alternatively,<br>
the ends 252 and 254 can be associated with a control unit 260 as shown<br>
schematically in Figure 11. In an embodiment shown in Figure 14, handpiece 220<br>
can include two switches 2210 and 2220 for independently controlling reversible<br>
motors 2240 and 2260, which can be mounted within handpiece 220. The motor<br>
speed and/or torque can be controlled by control unit 260, and the motors can<br>
include a coupling mechanism which applies frictional force to the track 250 to drive<br>
the track ends forward (distally toward flexible member 230) or backward<br>
(proximally away from flexible member 230) depending on the position of switches.<br>
In the embodiments shown, track 250 is a single piece which extends from<br>
first end 252, passes through handpiece 220 and extends distally through guide tube<br>
242 to exit guide tube 242 near the distal end 234 of flexible member 230. Track<br>
250 extends from the bevel cut distal end of guide tube 242 to extend around loop<br>
portion 256 and enters the bevel cut distal end of guide tube 244 on substantially the<br>
opposite side of flexible member 230 from which track 250 exits guide tube 242.<br>
The loop portion 256 comprises a smooth, rounded arc or other curve in which the<br>
track 250 turns through (subtends) an angle of at least about 90 degrees, more<br>
particularly at least about 180 degrees. In Figure 11 of the drawings, the track 250<br>
turns through an angle of more than 180 degrees in loop portion 256. Track 250<br>
extends proximally through guide tube 244 and back through handpiece 220 to<br><br>
second end 252. In Figure 11, a portion of guide tube 244 is shown cut away to<br>
illustrate track 250 extending through the guide tube 244.<br>
In order to advance the flexible member 230 (and its associated components)<br>
into the body lumen, the distal end of the flexible member 230 can be positioned in<br>
the entrance of the lumen. One (or both) track ends 252 and 254 can be advanced<br>
toward handpiece 220 (e.g. by pushing gently on the track ends), while the handpiece<br>
220 and flexible member 230 are held stationary. Advancing either end of the track<br>
250 causes the loop portion 256 to increase in length and the track to"unfurl"as it<br>
advances out of the confines of the distal end of flexible member to advance within<br>
the lumen while following the curvature of the lumen. Once the loop portion 256<br>
has been advanced distally from the flexible member 230 (as can be viewed with<br>
camera 420), the flexible member 230 can be advanced distally along the track 250.<br>
Flexible member 230 (and associated camera 420 and optical fiber 320) are<br>
advanced further into the body lumen by pushing distally on the handpiece 220, and<br>
simultaneously pulling proximally on either track end 252 or track end 254. Without<br>
being limited by theory, it is believed that by pushing the handpiece 220 and<br>
attached flexible member 230, while at the same time pulling back (proximally) on<br>
one of the track ends 252 and 254, the force required to advance flexible member<br>
230 through the lumen (e.g. GI tract) is reduced. In particular, in one embodiment,<br>
the handpiece 220 can be pushed distally while pulling back on one, but not both,<br>
ends 252/254.<br>
Figures 13A-E illustrate schematically how the track 250 can be advanced in<br>
the colon, and how the flexible member 230 can then be advanced along the track to<br>
position the distal end of the flexible member 230 at a desired location in the colon.<br>
In Figure 13A, the track 250 is shown in a relatively retracted configuration after<br>
initial insertion of the medical device into the GI tract. In Figures 13B-13D, the<br>
track is advanced distally through the flexible member 230 (by pushing one or both<br>
the ends 252 and 254 toward handpiece 220). Advancing track 250 through<br>
handpiece 220 and member 230 enlarges loop portion 256, and unfurls loop portion<br>
256. In Figure 13D the loop 256 is shown unfurled to a position associated with the<br>
beginning of the transverse colon. The flexible member 230 and associated camera<br>
and light source can then be advanced to the transverse colon, as shown in Figure<br>
13E, by pushing the handpiece/flexible member 230 distally into the GI tract, while<br><br>
simultaneously pulling back (proximally) on one of the ends 252 and 254 of the<br>
track 250. In Figure 13E the loop portion 256 has retracted proximally in the colon<br>
relative to its position in Figure 13D as a result of pulling back on one of the ends<br>
252/ 254. The steps shown in sequence in Figures 13B-E can be repeated, as<br>
desired, to position the distal end of the flexible member 230 at a desired location.<br>
Track 250 can be a guide wire having a generally round cross section. One<br>
suitable material for use as track 250 is a guidwire having a nitinol core with a<br>
diameter of about 0.021 inch to about 0.025 inch surrounded by a stainless steel wire<br>
coil having a diameter of about 0.008 inch. The overall diameter can be between<br>
about 0.037 inch and about 0.041 inch, and the stainless steel coil may be soldered<br>
or otherwise attached at about 50 cm intervals to hold the stainless steel coil in place<br>
relative to the nitinol core. Another suitable material for use as a track 250 is a<br>
guidwire marketed as Elite Protector™ Elite 480 wire guide available from Wilson-<br>
Cook Medical, Inc. of Winston Salem, NC, and having a diameter of about 0.035<br>
inch. The track can have length of about 15 feet or more, depending on the length of<br>
lumen being investigated<br>
Track 250 slides within track guide tubes 242 and 244. Track guide tubes<br>
242 and 244 can be formed of a low friction material, or be treated to have a low<br>
friction coating. In one embodiment, tubes 242 and 244 can be reinforced Teflon<br>
tubing to provide low friction interface with track 250. The tubing can be a wire re-<br>
inforced Teflon tube, such as is manufactured by International Polymer Engineering<br>
of Tempe Arizona The outer diameter can be less than or equal to about 0.10" and<br>
the wall thickness can be about 0.016".<br>
While the track guide in Figure 11 is shown as a tube, it will be understood<br>
that other guide geometries can be employed, including without limitation channels,<br>
rails, and grooved surfaces, as guides for supporting and guiding track 250. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the interior diameter of the sheath 236 can be adapted to<br>
provide a track guide.<br>
While two guide tubes are illustrated in Figure 11, in an alternative<br>
embodiment, a single guide tube could be used (e.g. guide tube 242), and the track<br>
250 could extend from a first end (located outside the patient) through handpiece<br>
220 and guide tube 242, extend around loop portion 256, and then re-enter guide<br><br>
tube 242. Alternatively, the track 250 could extend from a first end located outside<br>
the patient, through the handpiece 220 and guide tube 242, extend around the loop<br>
portion 256, and have a second end fixed at or near the distal end of the flexible<br>
member 230 (in which case a single track end would extend outside the patient, and<br>
this track end would be advanced toward handpiece 220 to increase loop portion<br>
256).<br>
The camera and light source located at the distal end of flexible member 230<br>
can be built into the flexible member 230, so as not to be removed. Alternatively,<br>
the camera and light source could be a sealed assembly which is releasably attached<br>
to the flexible member 230 (such as by threaded attachment, snap ring attachment,<br>
bayonet style attachment, and the like). In one embodiment, the flexible member<br>
230 (with associated guide tubes, fluid tubes, and working channel) can be<br>
disposable, and the camera and optics can be reusable.<br>
Figure 15 and Figure 16 (an end view taken at section 15-15) illustrate an<br>
embodiment having a single guide tube 242, along with a camera unit and light<br>
source in self contained unit 420. In Figure 15, a portion of sheath 236 is shown cut<br>
away. The track 250 extends from guide tube 242, turns through loop portion 256,<br>
and is attached at the distal end of flexible member 230, such as by being fixed to an<br>
end piece 285 positioned at the distal end of flexible member 230.<br>
Figures 17 and 18 illustrate an embodiment comprising two tracks 250A and<br>
250B, and corresponding track loop portions 256A and 256B which are disposed in<br>
generally perpendicular planes. In Figure 17, the sheath 236 is shown in phantom to<br>
reveal guide tracks 242A, 242B, and 244B (guide track 244A not visible), as well as<br>
optical fiber 320 and camera unit 420. In the embodiment shown in Figures 17 and<br>
18, optical fiber 320 can pass through an aperture hole in a band 500, and band 500<br>
can hold optical fiber 320 adjacent camera 420. Other tubes passageways (e.g. 600,<br>
700, 800 not shown in Figures 17 and 18) can also be supported in apertures in band<br>
500. Track retainer ring 257 is provided to hold and/or space tracks 250A and 250B<br>
in a desired position. Track retainer ring 257 can include apertures spaced<br>
circumferentially at 90 degree intervals around ring 257 (apertures not shown )<br>
through which tracks 250A and 250B can slide. Accordingly, track retainer ring 257<br>
can support track loop portion 256A in a first plane, and loop portion 256B in a<br>
second plane which is generally perpendicular to the first plane. Spokes 259 can be<br><br>
used to support retainer ring 257 on band 500. If desired, sheath 236 can be attached<br>
to retainer ring 257 if tracks 250A and 250B are supported to slide through ring 257<br>
(eg. if tracks 250A and 250B pass through apertures in ring 257.)<br>
In yet another embodiment, track 250 can comprise a wire or other suitable<br>
track piece having no distinct ends (i.e. no ends 252/254), but instead may comprise<br>
a smooth, uninterrupted track having a closed configuration (e.g. race track, oval,<br>
etc.) with a loop portion of the closed configuration track extending through the<br>
flexible member 230 to extend distally of the distal end 234 of the flexible member<br>
230, and another loop portion of the closed configuration extending proximally of<br>
the handpiece 220. In such an embodiment, the loop portion extending proximally<br>
of the handpiece 220 can be manipulated by hand or by a controller to advance the<br>
loop portion distal of the flexible member 230 within the body lumen.<br>
In each of the embodiments, it will be understood that one or more seals may<br>
be provided, as desired, to restrict gas or liquid flow through or around the flexible<br>
member 230, such as from a point outside the patient to a point within the lumen,<br>
especially if there is a desire to provide vacuum at the distal end of flexible member<br>
230, or to otherwise isolate conditions in the lumen from conditions outside the<br>
lumen. For instance, with reference to Figures 11 and 12, it may desirable to provide<br>
a seal in association with guide tracks 242 and 244, and in channel 800 to prevent air<br>
from passing through the guide tracks or the channel 800. Seals for channels can be<br>
in the form of a small, flexible silicone rubber boot having an aperture through<br>
which a track 250 or instrument 900 can pass. Similarly, a flexible cuff or collar can<br>
be positioned over the flexible member 230 and can provide a seal between the<br>
flexible member 230 and the portion of the patient's body adjacent the opening to<br>
the patient's lumen. Lubricating gels and other lubricating products can also be<br>
utilized to enhance or provide sealing.<br>
