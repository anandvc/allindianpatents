				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pneumatic structural<br>
component in accordance with the preamble to Claim 1.<br>
Several pneumatic structural components in the form of<br>
inflatable tube shaped hollow bodies have become known, for<br>
example from US 3,894,307 (D1), US 4,712,335 (D2), US<br>
5,735,083 (D3), and FR 2,741,373 (D4). If such a component<br>
is loaded transversally, then the aim to be addressed lies<br>
principally in containing the tensional and shear forces,<br>
without the component collapsing. Whilst solutions are known<br>
primarily from D3 and D4, which can contain the tensile<br>
forces, in Dl and D2 solutions are published additionally for<br>
the containment of shear forces.<br>
In D2 the shear forces are contained by numerous carbon<br>
fibre rods, which are held in tension between two separately<br>
constructed abutments - for instance from reinforced<br>
concrete. The pneumatic part of the components described<br>
there has the aim only of stabilising the pressure rods<br>
against primarily sideways buckling.<br>
In Dl several of the components described are joined<br>
together parallel to each other into a bridge. The tensile<br>
forces are contained by cables led separately underneath, the<br>
shear forces by the bridge plates of elements set in rows<br>
against each other. Each element itself must here be secured<br>
against buckling to two further cables running parallel to<br>
the pneumatic elements.<br>
In the documents closest to the present invention, D1,<br>
D2, arrangements are described which indeed have both tensile<br>
and shear elements, but are, however, very expensive both in<br>
production and also in application. Apart from this the<br>
individual pneumatic elements are only applied as holders of<br>
the separation between tensile and shear elements and could<br>
be replaced in this function by other light components. The<br>
aim of the present invention comprises the production of<br>
pneumatic structural components with tensile and shear<br>
elements, which can be produced simply and cost effectively,<br>
can be easily assembled to complex structural components and<br>
constructions such as roofs and bridges and whose erection<br>
can also be very quickly accomplished.<br>
The addressing of this aim is given in the<br>
characterising part of Claim 1 with regard to its essential<br>
features, in the following claims with regard to further<br>
advantageous features.<br>
The subject of the invention is more clearly explained<br>
using the attached/drawing by means of several embodiments.<br>
Shown are:<br>

embodiment of a pneumatic structural component<br>

embodiment,<br>

Fig. 9 an example of the combination of components<br>
according to Fig. 8,<br>
Fig. 10 a fifth embodiment.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of a first<br>
embodiment of the inventive idea. The component shown here<br>
comprises an elongate, essentially cylindrical hollow body 1<br>
inflated with compressed air, of length L and with a<br>
longitudinal axis A, which is manufactured from a flexible<br>
and airtight material. On its upper side a pressure rod 2 is<br>
attached which can be impacted with axial forces. Its ends<br>
are formed as nodes 3, onto which two tension elements 4 are<br>
fastened in each case. The axial ends of the hollow body 1<br>
carry a cap 5 in each case; for instance one of these caps 5<br>
is equipped with a valve 6 for inflating and deflating the<br>
hollow body 1.<br>
The two tension elements 4 each embrace the hollow body<br>
1 in the form of a screw with opposite circulating senses for<br>
instance once each with a constant pitch. They therefore<br>
intersect each other at a position 8 in the centre of a<br>
surface line 7 opposite to the pressure rod 2. The pressure<br>
rod 2 and the surface line 7 both lie on a plane of symmetry<br>
E, which similarly includes the longitudinal axis referenced<br>
A of the hollow body 1. The pressure rod 2 is attached onto<br>
the hollow body 1 such that for instance in the slack<br>
condition of the hollow body 1 it can be pushed in as is<br>
shown in Fig. 3a, b. In this way it is secured against<br>
sideways buckling. Various types of construction of the<br>
nodes 3 are known and familiar to the construction engineer,<br>
so that their representation can be omitted here.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an example of the loading of the component<br>
according to Fig. la, b. A force Fm lying in the plane of<br>
symmetry E works on the centre of the pressure rod 2. This<br>
is supported in the nodes 3. Neglecting the self weight of<br>
the component, then bearing pressures FA work on each node 3.<br>
As is known to the specialist, pure pressure forces Fs are<br>
now exerted from both nodes 3 on the pressure rod 2 and pure<br>
tensile forces Fz in the tension elements 4, whereby the<br>
vector components of these tensional forces, which are<br>
perpendicular to the plane of symmetry E always compensate to<br>
null, however provide a great stiffness and buckling<br>
resistance to the component perpendicular to the plane of<br>
symmetry E. The limit loading of such a component is<br>
obtained in that the surface pressure (in N/m2) of the hollow<br>
body 1 caused by the tension of the tension elements 4 must<br>
be smaller than the overpressure p acting in the hollow body<br>
1.<br>
Fig. 3a, b, c are representations of some constructional<br>
details of the hollow body 1. In the cross section according<br>
to Fig. 3a the hollow body 1 is set out in separation of<br>
functions: an outer skin 10, for instance made from a woven<br>
textile assumes the force and tensile loadings. In the<br>
interior it hides an airtight tube 11 of a suitable<br>
elastomer, which is defined and maintained in form by the<br>
skin 10. There are for instance sleeves 12, 13 sewn onto the<br>
skin 10, which may be continuous or interrupted. The sleeve<br>
13 accepts the pressure rod 2, the sleeve 12 the tension<br>
elements 4, which are set out here as flat ribbons.<br>
In the illustration according to Fig. 3b the skin 10 and<br>
the tube 11 form a functional entity, which is designated<br>
pressure body 14 and for instance comprises a plastics<br>
material laminated weave, which is either sewn and sealed,<br>
welded or glued in a known manner. As a modification to the<br>
sleeves 12, 13 the pressure body 14 carries several loops 15,<br>
16, whereby the simple loops 15 are provided for the tension<br>
elements 4, whose position is defined by its characteristic<br>
as geodetic lines, the loops 16 for the pressure rod 2<br>
however are produced as so-called capstan loops, which loop<br>
around the pressure rod once. In the slack condition of the<br>
pressure body 14 the loops 16 are free, the pressure rod 2<br>
can be pushed in without more ado. In the operating<br>
condition of the pressure body 14 they are however laid<br>
tightly around the pressure rod 2 and thereby prevent its<br>
sideways buckling. In accordance with the requirements which<br>
are placed upon the component, the materials used can be<br>
adapted from a wide range. For the more simple applications,<br>
textile materials such as polyester cords and weaves for the<br>
tension elements 4 and the armouring of the hollow body 1 are<br>
completely sufficient and also cost effective. For the<br>
pressure rod 2 itself, simple materials such as for instance<br>
bamboo rods can be used. Since the pressure rod 2 is well<br>
secured against sideways buckling by the sleeves 13, the<br>
pressure rod 2 can also be put together from butt jointed<br>
individual pieces.<br>
For high loadings however, textile materials of aramid<br>
fibres and for the pressure rod 2 composite materials using<br>
carbon fibres in a suitable plastics material matrix can be<br>
provided.<br>
The embodiments represented in Fig. 3a, b, c are not<br>
limited in their features; the specialist entrusted with the<br>
solution of these details will have many further solutions<br>
available to him.<br>
The first embodiment of the pneumatic structural<br>
component according to Fig. la, b, 2 is preferably suited for<br>
a point load in the centre of the component or for a<br>
uniformly distributed loading. If the load distribution has<br>
to be optimised for other load application positions, then<br>
the number of the tension elements 4 can be increased. This<br>
is shown by means of Fig. 4a to e.<br>
Fig. 4a shows the embodiment of Fig. la, b and Fig. 2 in<br>
the development of the hollow body 1. In Fig. 4b each<br>
tension element. 4 describes two complete revolutions about<br>
the hollow body 1 and is also fastened at L/2 to the pressure<br>
rod 2. If the component according to the invention is<br>
applied as a bearing beam or an element corresponding to it,<br>
then in accordance with the embodiment in Fig. 4b a support<br>
is necessary at L/2. Thereby this embodiment corresponds to<br>
that in Fig. 4a over half L.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 4c is an overlay of<br>
that according to Fig. 4a and b with regard to the tension<br>
elements 4. Since the hollow body 1 is supported by the<br>
tension elements 4 as in Fig. 4a at L/2, no central support<br>
is required here. Furthermore the preference for point<br>
loading at L/2 also disappears.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 4d three pairs of<br>
tension elements 4 are applied; the component is thereby<br>
suited for line loading. At the positions 8 where the<br>
tension elements 4 intersect, they are mutually secured<br>
against movement. Fig. 4e shows the application of two pairs<br>
of parallel mutually parallel tension elements 4. The<br>
tension elements 4 not terminating at the ends of the<br>
pressure rod 2 are also secured in node elements. This<br>
embodiment also emphasises the preference for point loading<br>
at L/2.<br>
Two embodiments in the form of non-cylindrical hollow<br>
bodies 1 are shown in Fig. 5, 6. That in Fig. 5 has a<br>
toroidal hollow body 1; the associated pressure rod 2 is then<br>
for instance arc shaped.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 6 is a double cone with<br>
for instance arc shaped surface lines. Obviously hollow<br>
bodies 1 shaped as a truncated cone are included in the<br>
inventive idea.<br>
The tension elements of the embodiment according to Fig.<br>
5, 6 are arranged analog to Fig. 1, 2. Obviously all the<br>
embodiments according to Fig. 4a to e, suitably adapted here,<br>
are similarly in accordance with the invention.<br>
Fig. 7 is the representation of an embodiment of the<br>
pneumatic structural component according to the invention as<br>
in Fig. 1, 2. Several, for instance five, of such components<br>
are joined together into a bridge 18. At each end of this<br>
bridge 18 a yoke 19 joins together all the nodes 3 on one<br>
side of the bridge and directs the applied force FA into the<br>
components. The yoke 19 is shown transparent in Fig. 7 with<br>
all the technical details omitted, since the construction of<br>
such yokes 19 is known to the specialist.<br>
Over the components, comprising hollow bodies 1,<br>
pressure rods 2 and tension elements 4, wooden planks 20, for<br>
instance, are laid at right angles to them and in a known<br>
manner joined to each other and to the pressure rods 2. The<br>
other end, not shown, of the bridge 18 is constructed in a<br>
similar manner. Obviously other known types of decking cover<br>
are possible for the bridge, such as perforated steel or<br>
other suitable forms and materials.<br>
Similarly not shown - since they are state of the art -<br>
are the valves 6 and the necessary manifold for simultaneous<br>
and pressure equalising inflation of the hollow bodies 1.<br>
Fig. 8 is the representation of a further embodiment of<br>
the inventive idea. Fig. 8a shows a side view, Fig. 8b a<br>
plan view and Fig. 8c a cross section. The hollow body 1<br>
including the various manufacturing modifications is<br>
constructed in the same way as that according to Fig. 1. The<br>
embodiment according to Fig. 8 has however two pressure rods<br>
2 attached at the sides. Each pressure rod 2 carries a node<br>
3 at each end for the positive engagement of the pressure rod<br>
2 and the tension elements 4. Although with the same<br>
diameter of the hollow body 1 its effective height is<br>
reduced, at the same time the component according to Fig. 8<br>
(referenced with the reference 22) is however in a position<br>
to accept positive and negative bending moments. The reduced<br>
maximum load capacity could, if necessary, obviously be<br>
compensated for by the choice of a greater diameter for the<br>
hollow body 1. The fastening of the pressure rods 2 to the<br>
hollow body 1 is effected using analog or identical means as<br>
in the first embodiment according to Fig. 1, 2. Otherwise<br>
the statements on Fig. 4a - e regarding the tension elements<br>
apply also for the embodiment according to Fig. 8.<br>
In Fig. 9 an embodiment is shown of a combination of<br>
components 22 according to Fig. 8. A multiplicity of such<br>
components 22 is arranged adjacent to each other. Each<br>
pressure rod 2 accepts the pressure force resulting from the<br>
loading of the component 22 in the direction of the vector<br>
arrow (loading force FL) in Fig. 9 of two adjacent components<br>
22. For the acceptance of a pressure rod 2 the walls of two<br>
adjacent hollow bodies 1 are joined together along two<br>
surface lines - by sewing, gluing or welding - whereby a<br>
longitudinal running pocket 21 occurs. By the inflation of<br>
the hollow bodies 1 the pressure rods 2 pushed into the<br>
pockets 21, still slack at first, are clamped between the<br>
hollow bodies 1 and are secured against buckling in both<br>
directions. With such an arrangement it is possible to<br>
create a lightweight roof of great span width, which<br>
additionally has the great advantage that both snow loading<br>
and lifting wind forces can be withstood.<br>
It is further included in the inventive idea to provide<br>
the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, 6 with two pressure rods 2<br>
according to Fig. 8. Furthermore such modified components<br>
according to Fig. 5 and 8 can also be joined together<br>
according to Fig. 9. A convex arched roof can be realised<br>
thereby; by changing the radius of curvature of the<br>
components according to Fig. 5 and 8 and modification of<br>
their length a cupola can be created.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a further embodiment of the inventive<br>
idea. Here, four pressure rods 2 are arranged at regular<br>
spacing around the cylindrical hollow body 1. Each pressure<br>
rod 2 has again at each end a node 3, into which for instance<br>
two tension elements 4 are fastened in each case. For<br>
greater clarity in Fig. 10 each pair of tension elements<br>
associated with a pressure rod 2 is given the same<br>
signatures. The pressure rods 2 are secured against buckling<br>
in the azimuthal direction of the cylindrical hollow body 1<br>
and against radial buckling outwards by sleeves (analog to<br>
the sleeves 13 according to Fig. 3), and against radial<br>
buckling inwards by the excess of pressure in the hollow body<br>
1. In this way an extraordinarily light and axially highly<br>
loadable component arises. By suitable and well known means<br>
it can be ensured that the axial pressure load on all four<br>
pressure rods is evenly distributed.<br>
