COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10, rule 13)<br>
"METHODS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONNECTION DETERMINATION IN MULTI-DOMAIN VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK"<br>
TELEFONAKTIEBOLAGET L.M. ERICSSON (publ), a Swedish Company of S-164 83 Stockholm, SWEDEN.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/004501	-2-	PCT/SE2005/001006<br>
Method and arrangement for connection determination in a multi-domain virtual private network.<br>
5	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates in  general to virtual private networks in<br>
communications systems  and in particular to  determination of suitable<br>
connection     paths     to     virtual     private     networks     in     multi-domain<br>
communications systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
   A Virtual Private Network (VPN) utilises a public or private communications<br>
15	  network to conduct private communications. Traditionally, a company or<br>
other customer that wanted to build a wide-area network had to provide for<br>
 its own dedicated lines between each node to provide the connectivity. Such<br>
                  solutions are, however, generally expensive and inflexible. During the last<br>
 years, the concept of VPNs has evolved rapidly. VPNs offer a solution, where<br>
20	a communications network is shared between many customers, but where<br>
the communication of each customer is virtually separated. VPN technology<br>
is  often  based on  the  idea  of tunnelling.   Network  tunnelling  involves<br>
establishing   and   maintaining   a   logical   network   connection.   On   this<br>
                   connection, packets are encapsulated within some other base or carrier<br>
25	protocol. They are then transmitted between VPN client and server and<br>
eventually   de-encapsulated   on   the   receiver   side.   Authentication   and<br>
         encryption assists in providing security.<br>
A tendency is that the number of network nodes that form a VPN grows fast,<br>
30	which results in large complex network structures and topology. This is<br>
caused, partly because of the increasing traffic on VPNs and partly on that the VPNs are requested to cover larger and larger geographical areas. Communication networks providing VPNs having nodes at all continents are<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/004501	PCT/SE2005/001006<br>
present today. However, the more nodes and the more traffic that is to be transmitted, the more complex the configuration of VPNs becomes.<br>
Conventionally, a VPN is created according to an agreement between  a<br>
5	network operator and a customer. The location of the nodes, the quality of<br>
service and other conditions are agreed on and a programmer at the operator sets up the configuration manually or by consulting configuration aid tools. When having more and more complex communications networks, such configuration becomes more and more complex and time consuming. When<br>
10	configuring connections spanning over several domains, there are typically a<br>
number of alternative connection paths. Information from several domains then   has   to   be   collected   and   compiled   in   an   appropriate   manner. Furthermore,   when   a   customer  wants   to   modify  its   VPN,   the   entire procedure has to be repeated. <br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
A general problem of prior-art solutions is thus that communications networks providing virtual private networks having a large geographical<br>
2	0	coverage and/or having large traffic become very complex. A further problem<br>
is that configuration of new VPNs or modifications of already existing VPNs become complex and time consuming. A further problem is that communication resources of network operators covering smaller geographical areas cannot be generally utilises for wide-area VPNs. Yet a<br>
2	5	further problem is that collection and compiling of VPN information from<br>
different domains is both time consuming and complex.<br>
A general object of the present invention is thus to improve methods for finding suitable connection paths of VPNs as well as providing systems and<br>
3	0	arrangements implementing such methods. A further object of the present<br>
invention is to provide methods for finding connection paths for VPNs utilising more than one network domain. Another further object of the present invention is to provide methods for finding connection paths for<br><br>
WO 2006/004501		PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
VPNs that are basically independent on the actual VPN technology used in the different domains. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a method enabling optimum or near-optimum configuration of a VPN.<br><br><br>
The above objects are achieved by methods and devices according to the enclosed patent claims. In general words, information about VPNs in a communications network having at least two interconnected domains is collected in a first domain by a push mechanism. The information about the<br>
10	VPNs comprises at least domain ID of domains in which the different VPNs<br>
currently are available. Domain VPN information is collected in each domain. The provision of domain VPN information can be performed in different ways, e.g. collection of data in a centralized or distributed manner, or by retrieving stored data. A distributed VPN control node is in particular embodiments<br>
15	localised to border nodes of a domain. The domain VPN information is in<br>
particular embodiments collected from the edge nodes of the domain. This can be performed by passively extracting broadcasted information from the edge nodes, by requesting domain VPN information from the edge nodes or a combination thereof. The collection can be triggered by an external event,<br>
2	0	such as a change in VPN information. The provided domain VPN information<br>
                 is spread to other domains, preferably under constrictions put by SLAs<br>
                between domain operators. In a preferred embodiment, the domain VPN<br>
                information is spread to adjacent domains, which modifies its own domain<br>
                VPN information and thereby forwards also the received VPN information to<br>
25	further adjacent domains. In such a cascaded manner, the entire available<br>
domain VPN information is spread to all domains. The collected information about the VPNs is evaluated in order to find suitable connection paths. In one embodiment, an evaluation according to a quality measure is performed and an optimum connection path is selected accordingly. In a preferred<br>
3	0	embodiment, an evaluation is performed and all connection paths exceeding<br>
a predetermined threshold are configured. A statistical evaluation of the practical need can then be performed after some initial operation time.<br><br>
WO 2006/004501	5	PCT/SE2005/001006<br>
	One important advantage with the present invention is that it provides a<br>
simple and stable platform on which operators of different domains can co<br>
operate. The domain VPN information is made available for supporting VPN<br>
configuration in essentially all domains of a multi-domain system. The<br>
inventive approach provides a means to ensure that an optimum or near-<br>
optimum connection path is possible to find according to present domain conditions. The invention is particularly well suited to be implemented in communication   networks   having   a   relatively   stable   configuration   and topology. <br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
5<br>
An embodiment of a general VPN provider architecture 1 is illustrated in Fig. 1. In this VPN Provider Architecture, there are five VPN Provider Domains 10A-E present, which are attached to each other by interdomain data connections 12A-G. One operator may control one or more of these domains<br>
10	10A-E, or they can all be controlled by separate operators. The relation<br>
between the domains 10A-E, i.e. the control of the interdomain data connections 12A-G are typically regulated according to agreements between the involved operators, e.g. a VPN Service Level Agreement (SLA). Each VPN provider domain 10A comprises VPN edge nodes  14 and core nodes 16,<br>
15	which can be VPN aware or VPN unaware, of which only a few are provided<br>
with reference numbers. The VPN edge nodes 14 are nodes through which customer sites 20 of different customers are connected to different VPN's in the architecture 1. VPN unaware nodes 16 are just intermediate nodes within a domain and is only used for forwarding messages and data between<br>
2	0	VPN edge nodes 14. The customers are unaware of which VPN unaware<br>
                 nodes that are used for the communication. The only important matter is the<br>
                starting and ending VPN edge node 14. A VPN connected in a domain can<br>
               thus be represented by a direct line between VPN edge nodes 14, even if the<br>
                actual communication may take place via one or several VPN unaware nodes<br>
25	16. In the remaining part of the present disclosure, the existence of VPN<br>
unaware nodes will in general be neglected, since the basic procedural steps according to the present invention are not directly dependent on the existence of any VPN unaware nodes 16 or not. In the practical implementation, it is, however, likely that VPN unaware nodes 16 are used<br>
3	0	for providing the actual connectivity.<br>
The VPN provider domains 10A-E are connected in a data plane via VPN border nodes 18, i.e. the interdomain data connections 12A-G start and end<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br>
6-<br><br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
	in a VPN border node 18. The VPN border node 18 may or may not at the<br>
same time also act as a VPN edge node 14. A customer site 20 is connected<br>
to one of the VPN edge nodes 14. Customer sites 20 of the same customer<br>
may then be connected through the VPN provider domains 10A-E by a VPN<br>
	22A-C. One customer may have customer sites 20 connected to different<br>
VPN's 22A-C. Also, more than one customer site 20 can be connected to the same VPN edge node 14, but will be unaware of the existence of the other customer site 20 as well as of the VPN to which the other customer site 20 is connected.<br>
10<br>
In the present embodiment, three VPN's 22A-C are illustrated. However, anyone skilled in the art realises that the number of VPN's in a real system typically is much higher. A first VPN 22A, illustrated by broken lines, is extended over three domains 10A, 10C, 10D and connects customer sites 20<br>
15	in all of these domains. A second VPN 22B, illustrated by dotted lines, is<br>
extended over all domains 10A-E of the present embodiment. Finally, a third VPN 22C, illustrated by a dash-dotted line, connects customer sites 20 only within the domain 10B. Each customer site 20 is unaware of the existence of customer sites 20 of other customers as well as of the existence of any VPN's<br>
20	except the one it is connected to. In such a manner, the privacy character of<br>
the VPN's is preserved, although they all share. the same basic communications resources. This is the scenario in which the present invention preferably operates.<br>
25	In the present disclosure, different connections are discussed - interdomain,<br>
incradomain, user plane connections, control plane connections, overlay control connections, connections between nodes and user terminals etc. It is assumed throughout the entire description that these connections can be of any kind. The basic idea of the present invention is not dependent on the<br>
30	actual connection technology. This means that both wired and wireless<br>
technologies can be used for any of these connections. In particular, concerning the use of wireless connections, the user terminals can be mobile<br><br>
WO 2006/004501	8	PCT/SE2005/001006<br>
relative to the edge nodes. The nodes within a domain can be mobile relative to the other nodes. Even the domains may be mobile relative to each other.<br>
Now, consider that a new customer site 20' is connected to a VPN edge node<br>
5	14' in domain 10E. If the customer site 20' wants to be connected to VPN<br>
                 22B, the procedures are probably relatively simple, since the VPN 22B<br>
                already is present within domain 10E. Manual or automatic VPN<br>
                reconfiguration procedures according to prior art may be employed, as well<br>
                as mixes therebetween. However, if the new customer site 20' wants to<br>
10	connect to VPN 22A or 22C, the situation becomes more difficult. In prior<br>
art, there are no general interdomain VPN configuration procedures.<br>
               One basic idea of the present invention concerns provision of domain VPN<br>
               information, comprising VPN identity of VPNs available in the respective<br>
15	domain.<br>
First, a few examples are described, illustrating how domain information can be collected. This is made in connection to Figs. 2A-3D. The main inventive ideas then follows.<br>
20<br>
Fig. 2A illustrates an embodiment of an initial phase of providing domain VPN information. Each VPN edge node 14 has stored information reflecting its own present VPN configuration regarding at least which VPN's that have connected customer sites at that particular VPN edge node 14. In particular<br>
25	embodiments, the VPN edge node  14 has information also about which<br>
customers that are connected to the VPN edge node 14 and associations between the present VPN's and customer sites 20. In some embodiments, information, such as VPN address space and address type (local or global), VPN quality of service classes, specified by requirements such as bandwidth,<br>
30	delay and jitter, and/or VPN set-up, i.e. use of tunnels or filters is provided.<br>
.Also information such as encryption properties, transparency layer properties, tunnelling properties and topology properties can be included. Furthermore,<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br><br>
9 <br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
the VPN border nodes 18 have stored information about the identity of the VPN provider domain it belongs to.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the domain VPN<br>
5	information stored in each VPN edge node 14, or at least parts thereof, is<br>
collected by each border node 18 in the same domain 10A-E. This is visualised in Fig. 2A as arrows, of which some are provided with reference number 24. In such a way, the collective domain node information for the own domain is available in each VPN border node 18 of each domain 10A-E. One alternative<br>
10	for the communication is to use a communication protocol similar to BGP<br>
(Border Gateway Protocol), spreading the information all over the domain without any particular knowledge about where the need for information is. The border nodes may then pick up all necessary information. This is an example of a push mechanism for distributing domain VPN information.<br>
15<br>
Fig. 2B illustrates another embodiment for providing domain VPN information, now concentrated to one domain IOC. If the VPN border nodes 18 have stored information about which edge nodes 14 that are present in the same domain 10C, the VPN border node 18 can simply request 23 any VPN<br>
2 0	edge node 14 to return its domain node information 24. In the simplest form<br>
of requesting information, the request itself could be a question if the VPN edge node 14 is associated to a certain VPN or not, e.g. received by the domain interconnection 12F. An acknowledgement message will in such a case not comprise any information as such, but will implicitly transfer<br>
2	5	information of this particular VPN at that particular VPN edge node. This is<br>
an example of a pull mechanism for distributing domain VPN information.<br>
The domain VPN information can also be collected with different timing. One alternative is to continuously or at least regularly collect such information to<br>
3	0	the border nodes in order to assure that the available information always is<br>
updated. In such embodiments, the information is preferably stored in the border nodes or in any other node where it is retrievable from the border node, see embodiments described further below. Another alternative is that<br><br>
WO 2006/004501	10	PCT/SE2005/U01006<br>
             the information collection is triggered by some event. This event could e.g. be<br>
             a broadcasting message from an edge node that there is a change of some<br>
             kind or, as being described above, a request for finding a particular VPN. If<br>
            all edge nodes have knowledge about which border nodes that are available<br>
5         in the domain, the information could also be sent directly to all border nodes<br>
              when such a change occurs. In case the information is searched as triggered by a request to  <br>
              find a certain VPN, the collected information may be restricted to that VPN and may not  <br>
               even necessarily be stored for later use.<br>
Fig. 2C illustrates an embodiment, where the domain VPN information is collected in a centralized manner. A storage 54 is provided to store all domain VPN information 24 provided by the different edge nodes 14. Any functionality using such domain VPN information can the retrieve this information from the central storage 54.<br>
15<br>
             Fig. 2D illustrates another embodiment based on a centralized collection of domain VPN data. Here, a request 23 or other external signal can initialise the provision of VPN data 24 to the storage 54. This request 23 does not necessarily have to come from the storage itself 54.<br>
20<br>
             As an alternative to collect domain VPN information among the domain <br>
nodes, the domain VPN information may instead be provided by retrieving <br>
data from a data storage. This stored data could e.g. be the result of a <br>
previous collection of data according to the procedures above, or could be <br>
provided from elsewhere.<br>
	In  the previously described embodiment, the provision of data within a<br>
domain is executed by the border nodes or a node in direct association<br>
therewith. Such a situation is also illustrated in Fig. 3A. Here, one domain<br>
10A in a multidomain system is illustrated more in detail. The border nodes<br>
18 are responsible for the data traffic to and from other domains by the data connections 12A and 12B. The border nodes 18 comprise in this particular embodiment means 41 for collecting domain VPN information, in the form of<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br><br><br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
	e.g. software functionality in the processors of the border node 18. The<br>
domain VPN information can be stored in a storage 54. A VPN control node<br>
43 for handling domain VPN information regarding the domain as a whole is<br>
thus in this particular embodiment implemented as a distribution of local<br>
means 41 at every border node 18.<br>
	In Fig. 3B, another particular embodiment is illustrated. Here, the border<br>
nodes 18 still comprise functionality entities 41 involved with domain VPN<br>
information. However, a distributed VPN control node 43 comprises in this<br>
	particular embodiment means 41 for providing domain VPN information<br>
situated in or in connection with the border nodes 18 and a central database 54. In the central database 54, the actual updated and preferably also historical VPN information is stored.<br>
15	In Fig. 3C, yet another particular embodiment is illustrated. Here, title VPN<br>
control node 43 is centralised and comprises the means 41 for providing domain VPN information and the central database 54 basically provided at the same location. The border nodes 18 are in this particular embodiment merely used for handling communications 45 between the VPN control node<br>
20	and neighboring domains. Functionalities in the border nodes 18 regarding<br>
control signalling associated with the actual data traffic can in such a way be utilised also to signal control messages concerning VPN configuration.<br>
In Fig. 3D, an embodiment having a VPN control node 43 that is virtually<br>
25	separated from the border nodes in the system is illustrated. The VPN<br>
control node 43 is in such an embodiment connected to VPN control nodes in other domains by dedicated VPN control signal connections 47, creating a high-level network of its own.<br>
3 0	In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the provided domain<br>
VPN information can be transferred within the system, i.e. between the different domains. This is illustrated in Fig. 4. The first step is provision of VPN information within each domain. This is performed by a VPN control<br><br>
WO 2006/WU501<br><br>
12<br><br>
PCT/SE2005/<mhmk><br><br>
	node 43 in each domain. However, the configuration of the VPN control<br>
nodes 43 may differ between the different domains. In Fig. 4 it is indicated<br>
that domain 10A has a VPN control node 43 similar to the example shown in<br>
Fig. 3A, domain IOC has a VPN control node 43 similar to the example<br>
	shown in Fig. 3B and domains 10B, 10D and 10E have VPN control nodes<br>
43 similar to the example shown in Fig. 3C. According to each SLA regulating the traffic between the different domains, at least a part of the available domain VPN information in each VPN control node 43 is in this embodiment  transferred  to  the  counteracting VPN  control  node in  the<br>
10	neighbouring domains. Arrows 28 illustrate this interdomain transfer of<br>
information. The SLA may comprise agreements about how much of the available information that should be made available for the neighbouring domain. In a general case, the VPN control node processes available intradomain VPN information into compiled or processed VPN information<br>
15	that is suitable to forward to neighbouring domains. If the domains are<br>
closely related, e.g. belonging to the same operator, the SLA could involve a total transparency in exchanging domain VPN information. In other cases, the processed information 28 that is transferred between the VPN control nodes 43 may be compiled VPN information, only revealing very basic fact<br>
2	0	about the individual domain VPNs. The information that has to be sent over<br>
the interdomain connections 12A-G in the present embodiment comprises at least the identities of the VPN's that are available somewhere beyond the border node that sends the information.<br>
25	According to the present invention, the information about VPNs comprises at<br>
least domain ID of domains in which the VPNs currently are available. Preferably, the information about VPNs also comprises further data, such as but not limited to properties of the VPNs, link qualities of links currently used by the VPNs, link qualities of links available for extending the VPNs, node ID<br>
3	0	of nodes at which the VPNs are available, and information about which<br>
domains that has to be transited to reach a domain in which the VPNs are available. The properties of the VPNs may comprise e.g. quality of service<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br>
-13-<br><br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
properties, encryption properties, transparency layer properties, tunnelling properties; and topology properties.<br>
In Fig. 4, the information 28 sent on the interdomain connections 12A-G<br>
5	causes an update of the total available VPN information situation at the<br>
receiving VPN control node. This VPN control node now also has information e.g. of what VPN's that are available via the interdomain connections. If more thorough information is available, the VPN control node may also determine e.g. edge node identities at which these different VPN's are available, VPN<br>
10	quality of service etc. The so achieved VPN information is now a property of<br>
the neighbour domain and can, if allowed by the SLA, be used for activities in that domain. The information stored in the storage 54 of the VPN control node 43 could be identical to the information received from the neighbouring domain or a processed version thereof, adding, removing or modifying the<br>
15	received information. For instance, the information could be labelled with an<br>
indication from what domain it originated from.<br>
This information distribution may continue in many successive steps, in some cases applying further modification of the information before forwarded<br>
2 0	to another domain, in analogy with the first transfer. Eventually, all VPN<br>
control nodes in the entire VPN provider architecture 1 have at least a processed version of all domain VPN information available in the system. At each VPN control node, the information may be processed according to the SLA that is valid for the associated interdomain connection to be used.<br>
25<br>
The exchange of domain VPN information can be performed with different timing. One alternative is to continuously or at least regularly exchange such information in order to assure that the available information always is updated. In such embodiments, the information is preferably stored in the<br>
30	VPN control nodes or in any other node, where it is retrievable by the VPN<br>
control node. In other words, this alternative is a typical push mechanism for data distribution.<br><br>
WO 20MANM501	14	PCT/SE2005/001006<br>
Another alternative is that the information exchange is triggered by some event. This event could e.g. be that a change of some kind has occurred in a domain.<br>
5	In  a  preferred  embodiment,  the  spreading of VPN  information  is  also<br>
associated with an acknowledgement procedure. When a domain has received VPN information from an adjacent domain, an acknowledgement message is returned in order to inform the domain providing the VPN information that the information now is available in the domain. Preferably,<br>
10	received   acknowledgements   that   are   associated   with   forwarded   VPN<br>
information are forwarded to the domain from which the VPN information came in the first place. In other words, VPN information is forwarded in one direction and corresponding acknowledgement messages are forwarded in return.<br>
15<br>
Now, consider the connection of a new customer site 20' to an edge node 14' intended to be connected to a certain VPN. The control node 43 identifies that a new customer site 20' is connected and investigates which VPN it is intended for. According to the present invention means are provided for<br>
20	finding information about the intended VPN and  according to  a quality<br>
measure finding suitable connection paths thereto.<br>
When a VPN control node 43 initiates a VPN connection request, it compares the requested VPN to the stored information about VPN's that is available<br>
25	through its interdomain connections. Information about in which domain<br>
the VPN exists and through which interdomain connections the VPN is reachable is available. In Fig. 4, the requested VPN is the VPN 22A of Fig. 1. VPN control node 43 of domain 10E has information about that VPN 22A is available through border node 18:1 according to two different paths. One<br>
3 0	alternative to reach VPN 22A is over interdomain connection 12D, through<br>
domain 10B and over interdomain connection 12A. The VPN 22A is then present within domain 10A. Another alternative to reach VPN 22A is over interdomain connection 12D, through domain 10B and over interdomain<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br>
15<br><br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
	connection 12C. The VPN 22A is then present within domain IOC. However,<br>
the VPN control node 43 of domain 10E has also information about VPN 22A<br>
via another border node 18. Here, the requested VPN 22A is reachable over<br>
interdomain connection 12E, since VPN 22A is available in domain IOC.<br>
Finally, the requested VPN 22A is reachable over interdomain connection<br>
12G, since VPN 22A is available also in domain 10D.<br>
Information about how the different domains are connected together has to<br>
be present when analysing possible connections. This information can be<br>
obtained in many different ways. Since the present invention operates most<br>
advantageously in systems having a relatively stable configuration, a "map" of the domains and interdomain connections is assumed to be spread over the different domains.<br>
15	The VPN control node 43 has thus all necessary information for finding the<br>
requested VPN. The VPN control node 43 evaluates the available information about the required VPN, by determining a quality measure for each possible connection path. Such a quality measure may be based on e.g. the number of new links to be established, the number of domains to pass before reaching<br>
20	the required VPN, how central the node, at which the VPN is reached, is<br>
situated within the required VPN, minimum quality of service properties of links to be established etc. In this example, the route over interdomain connection 12E seems most simple to use, but e.g. available quality of service levels may change such decisions.<br>
25<br>
                The process of finding suitable connection paths could be performed according<br>
                to different principles. One possibility is to have an acceptance threshold and<br>
                only connection paths having a quality measure exceeding the acceptance<br>
                 threshold will be considered at all. For the remaining suitable connection<br>
3 0	paths, one may select the one having the highest quality measure to be<br>
configured. One may also choose to select more than one connection path to be configured, in the extreme case all accepted connection candidates.<br><br>
WO 2006/004501<br><br><br>
16 <br>
PCT/SE2005/001006<br><br>
                 In the present invention, the provided domain VPN information is spread to<br>
                all VPN control nodes 43 of the entire system 1. In such a way, a request for<br>
                finding a suitable VPN can be put directly to a VPN control node 43 of the<br>
                "home" domain. The provision and exchanging of VPN information can as<br>
5	 indicated before be performed continuously, regularly or even trigged by the<br>
 request itself.<br>
                 This approach has the disadvantage that the entire system  1 has to be<br>
                 updated in every single VPN control node 43. However, in systems where the<br>
10	structure of domains and VPNs is fairly static, the communication efforts<br>
necessary to keep the VPN control nodes 43 updated are relatively low.<br>
In the process of spreading the VPN information over the system, there is<br>
       preferably a limitation of further forwarding of received information. In Fig.<br>
5, a situation potentially giving a risk for endless loops of VPN information<br>
provision is illustrated. A communications network 1 comprises five domains 10A-E. In domain 10E, a VPN 22A is available. Now, consider a situation, where VPN 22A is changed in some manner, e.g. that an intra-domain connection  is  upgraded  to   support  a  higher  bandwidth.   Domain   10E<br>
2	0	performs an internal updating of the VPN information and sends updated<br>
VPN information to its sole adjacent domain 10A. The domain 10A updates its own database and forwards the VPN information to domain 10B.<br>
Also in domain 10B the information about VPN 22A is updated. The update<br>
25	information is then forwarded to the further adjacent domains IOC and 10D.<br>
The procedure is repeated also in these domains and another forwarding of the VPN information is performed. Domain IOC sends the information to the domain 10D and the domain 10D sends the same information to the domain IOC. The procedure continues, and an endless loop of VPN information will<br>
3	0	circulate between domains 10B-D. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, means for prohibiting the information requests to be forwarded in encless loops are provided. Such means for prohibiting looping of information requests are preferably provided in connection with sending or<br><br>
WO 2006/004501	17	PCT/SE2O05/OO1O06<br>
             receiving of such information requests, i.e. they are arranged either to<br>
              prohibit the actual forwarding to a new adjacent domain or to prohibit the<br>
             acceptance of a received information request. Several embodiments of posing<br>
              restrictions on forwarding are possible. Some of them are briefly mentioned<br>
5	here below.<br>
In one embodiment of a loop prohibiting arrangement, each VPN information message is provided with an identity. This identity could e.g. be a separate field having a certain unique identity number, or the identity could be based<br>
10	on the actual information it carries. If separate identities of VPN information<br>
messages are used, received and accepted VPN information messages are preferably stored in a storage. When a new VPN information message arrives, a comparison is made with the stored data to reveal if the information request already has been received before. In such a case, the request is<br>
15	neglected. Otherwise the request is accepted and the identity is added to the<br>
storage.<br>
	The comparison could also be performed in connection with the actual<br>
                  forwarding of the VPN information. In such a case, the message identity<br>
20	could be stored in the storage and an extra condition for forwarding the<br>
request could be that there should not be two identical message identities within the database.<br>
If the identity is based on the VPN information itself, the received VPN<br>
2	5	information is compared with the corresponding VPN information presently<br>
stored in the domain. If the VPN information does not cause any changes to be made, the received VPN information is considered as a duplicate message and is rejected. In such an arrangement, only true updates are forwarded.<br>
3	0	Another embodiment for loop prohibiting is based on information about<br>
forwarding paths. By adding information in the VPN information message itself about which domains that are passed during the forwarding process, a receiving  domain   can  easily   search   for  its   own   identity  among   this<br><br>
WO 2006/M4501	18	PCT/SE2005/001M6<br>
              information. If the own identity is present, the information is neglected.<br>
              Otherwise, the own identity is added and the information can be forwarded.<br>
             The comparison can also be made at the sending side. Before forwarding a<br>
             VPN information message to a domain, the sending domain searches the<br>
5	forwarding path information for the identities of its adjacent domains. For<br>
domains which already are present in the forwarding path, forwarding is prohibited.<br>
Yet another embodiment is based on life-time. A certain life-time can be set<br>
10	when creating the original VPN information update, e.g. by fixing a validity<br>
                 expiration time. When receiving and/or forwarding such information, this<br>
                validity expiration time is checked against e.g. a system time, and when the<br>
                validity is expired, no more forwarding is performed. A variation of the lime-<br>
                  time concept is to set a remaining life-time, which then is reduced in<br>
15	connection to each forwarding. When the remaining life-time vanishes, no<br>
more forwardings are performed. This approach can then also be used, utilising the number of forwardings as a measure of "time", i.e. it is stated from the initialisation that a maximum number of forwardings is allowed. For each forwarding, the remaining number is reduced by one unit.<br>

Fig. 6A illustrates a block scheme of a particular embodiment of a relatively general VPN control node 43 according to the present invention providing the connection path determination arrangement. The VPN control node 43 comprises means 52 for providing domain VPN information. This information<br>
25	may be provided by other nodes in the domain by connections 62. A main<br>
control communication interface 40 is provided for communication with other domains. This interface 40 may be arranged in combination with the intra-domain connections 62. An evaluation unit 49 investigating if an identity of a requested VPN matches with domain VPN information is provided.<br>
3 o	The evaluation unit 49 is further arranged for performing the above discussed<br>
evaluation of the information about the requested VPN according to a quality measure for finding suitable connection paths. The VPN request can be received from another node of the own domain or can be initiated within the<br><br>

                VPN control node. An external VPN handling section 44 is responsible for<br>
                handling interdomain VPN configuration. The external VPN handling section<br>
               44 comprises means for spreading 71 the information about VPNs available in<br>
               the own domain to adjacent domains. The external VPN handling section 44<br>
5	further comprises means for receiving 73 information about VPNs from<br>
adjacent domains and means for distributing 72 information based on received information about VPNs from adjacent domains to other adjacent domains. The means 71-73, and in particular means 71-72, can preferably be arranged in an integrated manner, since there are many common part<br>
10	functionalities  of the different means.  However,  in  other embodiments,<br>
separate units can be provided. An internal VPN handling section 41 has functionalities for configuring internal connections within the own domain and comprises preferably the means for collecting information about VPNs available in the own domain, i.e. the means 52 for providing domain VPN<br>
15	information.<br>
                 Fig. 6B illustrates a block scheme of another particular embodiment of a<br>
                 VPN  control  node 43  according to  the  present invention.  Domain VPN<br>
                information regarding the own domain is provided by an internal VPN<br>
20	handling section 41, comprising means for collecting 52 information about<br>
VPNs. The internal domain VPN information is in this particular embodiment stored in a data memory 74. This information is in this particular embodiment provided, as illustrated by the arrow 62, by communication with other nodes within the domain. In other embodiments, this information<br>
2	5	can be obtained in other ways. The internal domain VPN information is also<br>
forwarded to a total VPN information database 54 in an external VPN handling section 44. The internal VPN handling section 41 also comprises an internal configuration machine 45, having functionalities for configuring internal connections within the own domain. The internal VPN handling<br>
3	0	section 41 is provided with internal domain VPN information, as well as<br>
information from the database 54. Communications regarding internal domain matters are thus performed over a connection 42 between the internal VPN handling section 41 and the external VPN handling section 44.<br><br>

              The VPN control node 43 has a main control communication interface 40<br>
              with other domains over an interdomain connection. Domain VPN<br>
              information from other domains are received by the interface 40, and an<br>
5	input processing unit 56 extracts useful information from the received data<br>
and stores this external information in an input database 58. In this input database 58, additional information as from which domain the external data was received is also stored. The input processing unit 56 and the input database 58 are in this embodiment comprised in the means for receiving 73<br>
10	information about VPNs from adjacent domains.  The  input database 58<br>
updates the total VPN information database 54 when appropriate. The external VPN handling section 44 also comprises an external configuration machine 60, having functionalities for configuring parts of interdomain connections that are relevant for the domain. This functionality will be<br>
15	described more in detail below.<br>
The external VPN handling section 44 also provides information to other domains. Domain VPN information, associated with the own domain and/or with other domains is extracted from the database 54 and provided to an<br>
20	output data processing unit 50. The retrieved information is processed<br>
according to SLAs associated with the different neighbour domains and stored in an output database 48. The SLAs thereby determines what information is allowed to be spread to the different neighbouring domains. Domain   operators   having   a   close   relationship   may   allow   for   more<br>
25	transparent exchange of information, whereas domains belonging to non-<br>
related operators may apply a more restrictive information exchange. Information about VPN's is transmitted on the interface 40, when suitable. The database 54, the output data processing unit 50 and the output database 48 are in the present embodiments comprised in a common unit<br>
3 0	71, 72 for spreading the information about VPNs available in the own domain<br>
and for distributing information based on received information about VPNs from adjacent domains.<br><br>

               An example, illustrated in Fig. 7, shows how a subsequent configuration of<br>
               an interdomain VPN can be automated. A new customer site 20' in the<br>
               domain 10E shall be connected to VPN 22A. It is assumed that VPN tunnels<br>
               are used for VPN connections both inside domains and between domains.<br>
5	The following steps are taken.<br>
	The VPN control node in domain 10E gets a request, in some way, from the<br>
                customer to connect to VPN 22A. Since the VPN database of domain 10E<br>
               shows that the VPN 22A is not present in domain 10E, the VPN control node<br>
10	in domain 10E cannot connect customer site 20' directly to the VPN 22A<br>
inside domain 10E. However, VPN information originated from other domains is available showing that a connection path to VPN 22A can be found at "nexthop" 10B, IOC and 10D.<br>
15	The VPN control node in domain 10E chooses to set up the VPN via the<br>
"nexthop" 10B only, according to the evaluation of the quality measure discussed above. It sets up a VPN tunnel 71 for VPN 22A from the edge node 14' where the customer site 20' is connected, to the border node 18:1, which is connected to domain 10B via link 12D. The VPN control node in domain<br>
20	10E initiates communication with the VPN control node in domain 10B and<br>
sets up a VPN tunnel 72 for VPN 22A over the link 12D to border node 18:2.<br>
The VPN control node in domain 10B sets up the VPN via the "nexthop" 10A. It sets up a VPN transit tunnel 73 for VPN 22A from the border node 18:2,<br>
25	which is connected to domain 10B via link 12D, to the border node 18:3,<br>
which is connected to domain 10A via link 12A. The VPN control node in domain 10B initiates communication with the control node in domain 10A and sets up a VPN tunnel 74 over the link 12A to border node 18:4. Since VPN 22A is present in domain 10A, the control node in domain 10A can set<br>
30	up an internal tunnel 75 from the border node, which is connected to<br>
domain 10B via link 12A, to the border node 18:5, which is connected to the VPN 22A.<br><br>

After each step, the updated VPN databases will be available for the next round of collecting VPN information.<br>
The basic steps of an embodiment of a method according to the present<br>
5	invention are illustrated in Fig. 8. The procedure starts in step 200. In step<br>
                 210, information about VPNs available in each domain is collected in<br>
                 respective domain. In step 212, the information about VPNs is spread to<br>
                adjacent domains. In step 214, information about VPNs from adjacent<br>
                domains is received. Based on the received information about VPNs from<br>
10	adjacent domains, information is distributed to other adjacent domains in<br>
step 216, with or without any intermediate processing. From the total information about VPNs, an evaluation of quality measures is made in step 218 to find suitable connection paths. The procedure ends in step 299.<br>
15	The embodiments described above are to be understood as a few illustrative<br>
examples of the present invention. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations and changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. In<br>
particular,  different part solutions  in the different embodiments  can be<br>
20	combined in other configurations, where technically possible. The scope of the<br>
present invention is, however, defined by the appended claims.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
METHODS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR CONNECTION DETERMINATION IN MULTI-DOMAIN VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK<br>
Information about VPNs in a communications network having at least two interconnected domains is collected in each domain by a push mechanism. The information about the VPNs comprises at least domain ID of domains in which the different VPNs currently are available. Domain VPN information is collected in each domain. The collection can be triggered by an external event, such as a change in VPN information. The provided domain VPN information is spread to adjacent domains, preferably under constrictions put by SLAs between domain operators. In a cascaded manner, the entire available domain VPN information is spread to all domains. The collected information about the VPNs is evaluated in order to find suitable connection paths.<br>
