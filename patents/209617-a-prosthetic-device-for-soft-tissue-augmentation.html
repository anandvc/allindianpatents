DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hydroqels and Their Preparation<br>
The success of plastic or reconstructive surgery depends to a great extent on the physical properties of the materials utilised. They must most certainly be biocompatible, stable and hon-toxic but they must also have physical properties that mimic the bodily tissue they are replacing, as in reconstructive surgery, or mimic the bodily tissue in the proximity of the endoprosthesis, as in cosmetic surgery.<br>
Materials such as collagen are resorbed into the body over short periods of time. Silicone and Soya have encountered serious safety issues. There is currently a need for a safe, stable, biocompatible material that possesses the physical properties to mimic soft tissue.<br><br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that a polyacrylamide hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, is an effective endoprosthesis with advantageous physical properties. Contrary to US 5,798,096, the polyacrylamide gel is stable. The hydrogel, as prepared by a process according to the present invention, is cross-linked with methylene bis-acrylamide to a degree such that the endoprosthesis prepared from said hydrogel possesses advantageous physical charactenstics. The hydrogel according to the present invention is a new chemical entity as indicated by its novel and advantageous physical characteristics. These secondary charactenstics are indicative that the degree of cross-linking in the hydroge! of the present invention differs greatly from polyacrylamide hydrogels prepared by disclosed processes. This degree of cross-linking is a critical contributor to its physical properties.<br>
The present investigators have provided a bio-stable hydrogel obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in amounts so as to give about 0.5 to 25% by weight polyacrylamide, based on the total weight of the hydrogel; radical initiation; and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution. The bio-stable hydrogel typically has a molecular weight between 0.01 x 106 and 20 x 106. The polymer is resistant to biological, degradation and is not permeable through biological membranes. The polyacrylamide hydrogel of the invention is fully biocompatible (according to ISO standard test ISO-10993). The polyacrylamide hydrogel does not have cytotoxic effect on human fibroblasts, is non-toxic, non-carcinogenic, non-allergenic, non-mutagenic. and resistant to enzymatic and microbiological degradation. Furthermore, the polymer is not water-soluble. A primary object of the invention is to provide a hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, said hydroge! obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide, radical initiation, and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution; said hydrogel being biocompatible, and said combining being in a molar ratio of 150:1 to 1000:1.<br>
A primary object of the invention is to provide a hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, said hydrogel obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide. radical initiation, and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution; said hydrogel being biocompatible, and said combining being in a molar ratio of 150:1 to 1000:1.<br><br>
Alternatively defined, one aspect of the invention relates to hydrogel comprising i) less than 3.5 % polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, cross-linked with methylene bis-acrylamide and ii) at least 95% pyrogen-free water or saline solution.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to a hydrogel for use as an injectable or implantable endoprosthesis said hydrogel comprising i) less than 3.5% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, cross-linked with methylene bis-acryiamide and ii) at least 95% pyrogen-free water or saline solution.<br>
In all embodiments wherein the hydrogel comprises less than 3.5% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, the hydrogel typically further comprises at least 95%) pyrogen-free water or saline solution.<br>
The hydrogel comprises less than 3.5% polyacrylamide preferably comprising at least 0.5%, such as at least 1 %, preferably at least 1.5% polyacrylamide, such as at least 1.6% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel.<br>
The hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide are chemically stable and bio-stable but may be very fluid such that they may be characterised in that it has a complex i/iscosity not less than 2 Pas, such as not less than 3, 4 or 5 Pas. In a suitable embodiment, the hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide is characterised in fhat it has complex viscosity from about 2 to 90, such as 5 to 80 Pas, preferably from about 6 to 76, such as from about 6 to 60, 6 to 40, 6 to 20, such as 6 to 15 Pas.<br>
The hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide has elastic properties in that the hydrogel may be characterised in that it has elasticity module of not less than 10 Pa, such as not less than 20, 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 or 35 Pa, such as not less than 38 Pa, Typically, the hydrogel has an elasticity module from about 10 to 700 Pa, such as about 35 to 480 Pa.<br>
these rheological features are in due in part to the degree of cross-linking and to the degree of swelling of the hydrogel. The hydrogel comprising less than 3.5%, plyacrylamide may be characterised in that the cross-linked polyacrylamide is to such as<br><br>
degree so as to have an efficient cross-linking density of about 0.2 to 0.5%, preferably about 0.25 to 0.4%.<br>
The cross-linking density is in turn due in part to the molar ratio between the acrylamide and methy!ene-bis-acryfamide. Typically said ratio is in the range 175:1 fo 800:1, such as from 225:1 to 600:1. preferably from 250:1 to 550:1, most preferably from 250:1 to 500:1. The absolute and relative amount of the redox agent (TEMED) and the initiator also influence the degree of cross-linking. As can be seen from Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, the present investigators have adjusted these parameters to influence the rheological properties of the hydrogel.<br>
The biocompatible hydrogels of the invention comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide may be suitably characterised, at least in part, by one or more of the following features: i) a cross-linking density of 0.2% to 0.5 %; ii) an elasticity modulus (G') of 10 to 700 Pa; iii) a complex viscosity of 2 to 90 Pa s; iv) a dry matter content of less than 3.5% such as less fhan 3.4, such as less than 3.3, such as less than 3,2, such as less than 3.1, such as less than 3.0, such as less than 2.9, such as less than 2.8, such as less than 2.7, such as less than 2.6 Pa s; v) a refractive index between 1.33 and 1.34.<br>
As staled, in all aspects of the invention wherein the hydrogel comprises less than 3.5% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, the hydrogel further comprising at least 95% pyrogen-free water or saline solution. In all embodiments wherein the hydrogel further comprises saline solution, the hydrogel preferably comprises less than 3 % polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel.<br>
The hydrogel of the invention is substantially free of materials which contribute to the solid weight content other than the acrylamide, methylene-bis-acrylamide and residual amounts (if any) of the initiators. The hydrogel is substantially free of any other polymeric content. The hydrogel further comprises at least 75% by weight pyrogen-free water or saline solution, preferably pyrogen-free water. In a suitable embodiment of the invention, the hydrogel comprises at least 80% by weight pyrogen-free water or saline solution, preferably at least 85 %, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% by weight pyrogen-free water or saline solution.<br><br>
The hydrogel comprises pyrogen-free water or saline solution. The combining of the reagents and the casting of the ge! may therefore be done in pyrogen-free water or saline solution. The use of saline solution will clearly increase the total solid weight content of the hydrogel but does not significantly influence the polyacryytamide content during the polymerisation reaction.<br>
A suitable saline solution has an osmolarity similar to that of interstitial fluid. Suitable saline solutions include but are not limited to the group selected from 0.25-1% aqueous sodium chloride, a Ringer-Lockart solution, an Earle solution, a Hanks solution, an Eagle medium, a 0.25 -1% glucose solution, a potassium chloride solution, and a calcium chloride solution, in a preferred embodiment, the saline solution is an about 0.8-1% aqueous sodium chloride solution, such as a 0.8, 0.9 or 1 % aqueous sodium chloride solution.<br>
; As stated, pyrogen-free water or saline solution is used for the washing process. The washing process serves, in part, to remove all but trace amounts of the monomers acryiamide and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide. These monomers are toxic to the patient as well as detrimental to the stability of the hydrogel. The washing process is preferably such that the concentrations of the monomers acryiamide and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide are below 50 ppm, more preferably below 40 ppm, such as below 30 ppm, most preferably below 20 ppm, typically below 10 ppm, typically below 5 ppm. In the method of the invention, the washing step comprises swelling the product for 50 to 250 hours, more typically for 70 to 200 hours.<br>
The hydrogel comprising less than 3.5% polyacrylamide was surprisingly found to be Stable at very low solid weight content, contrary to the teachings of US 5,798,096. Polyacrylamide hydrogels with a solid-weight content of 0.5% have been prepared by the present investigators. Preferred embodiments of the hydroge! of the invention comprise at least 0.5%, such as at least 1 %. preferably at least 1.5% polyacrylamide. such as at least 1.6% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel.<br>
The hydrogel is suitably a composite of cross-linked polyacrylamide chains and pyrogen-free water. Water contained in the hydrogel as part of a composite is loosely bound with the polymer chains. When present in a body, some of the water molecules move into the tissue by osmosis resulting in a smoothing out of the affected skin surface. In the<br><br>
embodiment wherein the hydrogel comprises saline solution, the iso-osmolarity of the saline solution with interstitial fluid minimises immune responses.<br>
As mentioned, the physical properties of the hydrogel are influenced in part by the degree of cross-linking. The degree of cross-linking may be controlled in part by the molar ratio of cross-linking agent, methylene bis-acrylamide, to acpylamide.<br>
Therefore, another object of the invention is a method for the preparation of a hydrogel comprising the steps of combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide, radical initiation, and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution so as to give less than 3.5% by weight polyacrylamide, based on the total weight of the polyacrylamide. The method is preferably such that the hydrogel comprises at least 0.5%, such as at least 1 %, preferably at least 1.5% polyacrylamide, such as at least 1.6% polyacrylamide by weight, based on the total weight of the hydrogel.<br>
In a especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the hydrogel is obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in amounts so as to give 1.6 to 3.5% by weight polyacrylamide and in a molar ratio of 150:1 to 1000:1, radical initiation, and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution.<br>
The combining of acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in preferably done in a molar ratio between acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide is from 175:1 to 800:1, such as from 225:1 to 600:1, preferably from 250:1 to 550:1, most preferably from 250:1 to 500:1.<br>
An illustrative preparation of the hydrogel according to the present invention is described in Example 1. The hydrogel having the desired physical properties has been obtained by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in a ratio of about 250:1, such as 252:1, 254:1, 256:1, 258:1 and 260:1, as well as by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in a ratio of about 500:1, such as 498:1,496:1 494:1 492:1, or 490:1. The hydrogel according to the present invention preferably has a complex viscosity from about 2 to 90, such as 5 to 80 Pas, typically from about 6 to 76, such as from about 6 to 60, 6 to 40, 6 to 20, such as 6 to 15 Pas. In a suitable embodiment, the washing step comprises swelling the product of the radical initiation step until the complex viscosity is from about 6 to 100 Pas,<br><br>
In a suitable embodiment of the invention, the hydrogel has a degree of cross-linking such that it has complex viscosity of not less than 2 Pas, such as not less than 3, 4 or 5 Pas, such as not less than 5.5 Pas, such as not less than 6 Pas, preferably not less than 6.2 Pas.<br>
The elasticity module is an alternative physical characteristic of the hydrogel indicative, in part, of the degree of cross-linking of the hydrogel according to the present invention. Typically, the degree of cross-linking is such that the hydrogel has an elasticity module of not less than 10 Pa, such as not less than 25, 30, 31, 32, 33. 34 or 35 Pa, such as not less than 38 Pa. The gel may be characterised in that it has elasticity module from about 10 to 700 Pa, such as about 35 to 480 Pa.<br>
As stated, in a most preferred embodiment, the hydrogel is obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene bis-acrylamide in amounts so as to give 1.6 to 3.5% by weight polyacry(amide and in a molar ratio of 150:1 to 1000:1, radical initiation, and washing with pyrogen-free water or saline solution. The radical initiation step yields a hydrogel still comprising toxic reagents and not yet possessing the beneficial physical properties of the hydrogel of the present invention. The washing step comprises swelling the hydrogel produced from the radical initiation step until the complex viscosity is from about 2 to 90 Pas.<br>
jAltematively measured, the washing step may comprise swelling the product of the radical initiation step until the elasticity module is elasticity module from about 10 to 700 Pa, such as from about 35 to 480 Pa.<br>
By nature, a low degree of cross-linking typically results in a higher swelling rate Consequently lowering the dry matter content (percentage acrylamide). as well as lowering the elasticity module and viscosity. Thus, in addition to the degree of cross-linking, the time the hydrogel is exposed to the washing step influences to a degree the physical properties of the gel.<br>
Typically, the washing step comprises swelling the product for about 80 to 100 hours, Such as 90-95 hours. This usually results in an increase in weight of the hydrogel of about 75 to 150%, usually around 100% increase.<br><br>
Furthermore, the amounts of the free-radical initiator in the radical initiation step and the amount of co-initiator influences the chain length and thus the physical properties of the hydrogel. In a typical preparation of the hydroge!, N-,N-,N-.N-tetramethyl ethylene diamint (TMED) is used as the co-initiator and ammoniumpersulfate (APS) is used as the free-radical initiator (redox-system). Adequate amounts of initiator and co-initiator are required to obtain the hydrogel according to the invention. As an illustration, an insufficient amount of these reagents will result in shorter chain lengths and consequently influence the degree of cross-linking and hence the physical properties of the hydrogel. Other reaction conditions, such as temperature also influence chain length.<br>
As stated, the degree of cross-linking influences the physical properties of the hydrogel. The degree of cross-linking of the hydrogel of the present invention may be indirectly measured, as described above, by the elasticity module and/or by the complex viscosity. An alternative measure of the degree of cross-linking of the hydrogel is its efficient cross-linking density. The hydrogel of the present invention preferably comprises 1.6 to 3.5% (^M/wt) polyacrytamide cross-linked with methylene bis-acrylamide and ii) pyrogen-free water or saline solution, preferably such that the degree of cross-linking as measured by its efficient cross-linking density is such that the efficient cross-linking density is about 0.2 to 0.5%, preferably about 0.25 to 0.4%.<br>

Polvacrylnmide Hydrogel For The Treatment Of Incontinence And Vesicourelal Reflux<br>
The loss of voluntary control of sphincter muscles underlies urinary and anal incontinence. Urinary incontinence, the inability to voluntarily retain one's urine in one's bladder, is common among the elderly. Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder may be voluntary, brought about stress, reflex or urge. Contraction of the detrusor muscle brought about by a stress results in involuntary urination unless the bladder sphincter muscle is voluntarily contracted. In the event that one has lost control of the bladder sphincter muscle, urination may be brought about by slight stress such as slight abdominal contractions during daily activities, sneezing, coughing, laughing, gas retention, surprises and countless other stimuli which may lead to contraction of the detrusor muscle. A similar principle underlies anal incontinence wherein one has diminished control of the anal sphincter muscle. Urinary and anal incontinence may be brought upon by ageing, trauma (such as in paraplegics), or congenitally related.<br>
Vesicourelal reflux is the result of decreased ureteral resistance wherein urine from the bladder refluxes back into the kidney. This can result in the transport of bacteria form the bladder back up through the ureter, clayceal dilation, the renal pyramids and the kidneys<br><br>
and may lead to infections and recurrent pyelonephritis as well as cause physiological injury to the renal parenchyma. This may lead to renal failure.<br>
Urinary incontinence, anal incontinence and vesicouretat reflux may be treated by increasing the resistance of passage through the urethra, the colon or rectum (or canalir analis), and the ureter, respectively, known as bulking processes<br>
Attempts to treat urinary incontinence have involved hydraulic apparatuses, such as in WO 01/50833 and US 4,969,474 and other controllable apparatuses such as prosthetic sphincters with inflatable cuffs as in US 4,571.749 and WO 01/47433. Weight loss, exercise, medication and surgical operation usually involving the elevation of the bladder neck or constructing a increasing resistance through the urethra using the surrounding tissue or using a prosthetic material. Materials such as collagen, PTFE, silicone, and Teflon have been used to this end (references to be added).<br>
Anal incontinence has also been addressed via controllable and operated devices such as in WO 01/47431. Vesicouretal reflux has been dealt with surgically (to extend the ureter, usually in the infant) and with antibiotics.<br>
A principle object of this aspect of the invention is to provide a polyacryiamide hydrogel to increase the resistance in the relevant conduits in the treatment of incontinence and vesicouretal reflux.<br>
US 6,129,761 discloses the use of injectable hydrogel and cellular compositions towards this end. The compositions are cell suspensions comprising cells mfxed with a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer. The polymer provides a medium and template for cell growth and cellular engraftment to the surrounding tissue. Cell growth coincides with polymer degradation to result in the desired tissue grov/th. The polymeric materials disclosed by US 6,129,761 consist of alginates such as modified alginates, bacterial polysaccharides such as gellan gum, plant polysaccharides such as carrageenans, lyaluronic acids, polyethylene oxfde-polypropylene glycol block copolymers, proteins such as fibrin, collagen, and gelatin, mixtures of polyethylene oxide and polyacrylic acid, cross-linked chitosan, photochemically cross-linked ethylenically unsaturated groups, nacromers such as PEG-oligolactyl-acrylates. polyethylenimine, poly-lysine. poly(vinylamine), and poly(allylamine). US 6,129,761 does not disclose the use of stable<br><br>

Polyacrylamide Hydropel For The Treatment Of Arthritis<br>
Arthritis is a degenerative condition which, when affecting the weight bearing joints such as the hip and knee joints, results in pain and hampered mobility. Arthritis may affect all joints. Degradation of articular and meniscal cartilage may result in damage to the surfaces separated by the cartilage and correspondingly to pain. Ageing is a primary cause of the degradation of the cartilage. The degradation may also result from, for example, congenital predisposition or trauma, such as repeated articulation of the joint.<br>
Arthritis has been treated traditionally with physiotherapy and more invasive treatments such as orthopaedic surgery and the introduction of artificial joint components. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents have been used with some success but these agents may counterproductively hamper proteoglycan synthesis in collagen and cartilage as well as have undesirable side effects. Cortisone injections also weaken articular cartilage with time.<br><br>
Soft compliant materials used to replace the cartilage have been developed to absorb the load on the joint and to distribute the lead evenly. US 4,344,193 dislcoses silicone rubber as a prosthetic device. One difficulty v;ith these devices is securing the devices in place and various anchoring systems have been developed (US 5,171,322; US 4,502, 161; US 4,919,667).<br>

Specific materials mentioned include polymethyl methacrylate polymer. The prosthesis is implanted into the joint. W6 00/59411 discloses a surgically implanted knee prosthesis wherein the load distribution device is constructed of material comprising a thermoset polymer or thermoplastic polymer. Hyaluronates and hyaluronic acids have been used for prosthetics and administered by injection into the intra-articular cavity of knees for the long-term relief of pain and improvement on the function of the knee joint. It has adequate viscosity and elasticity but has been prone to sheering due to mechanical stress and is biodegradable and has faced resorption problems.<br>

Furthermore, still within the preferred combined embodiment of a viscosity of less than 25 Pa s and an elasticity less than 200 Pa, such as having a complex viscosity less than 15 Pa s and an elasticity less than 100, the hydrogel is obtainable by combining acrylamide and methylene-bis-acrylamide in a molar ratio of about 275 to 1000, typically 300 to 800. preferably in a ratio of about 300 to 500.<br>
The hydrogel of the invention is resilient to mechanical stress as well as prividing lubrication within the joint. This mimics the combination of naturally occurring cartilage<br><br>
and synovial fluid in the joint. Synovial fluid is produced by the synovial membrane and forms in the interface with both the synovium and the articular cartilage. Its function is nutrition of the cartilage, lubrication, load bearing and shock absorption (see Gomez and Thurston, Biorheology 30, 409-427 (1993)). Synovial liquid is a solution of a very  sophisticated polymer complex made of the linear hyaluronic acid backbone having protein branches and has an elasticity modulus G' of 60 Pa and a complex viscosity of about 1-10 Pa s. Certain embodiments of the hydrogel of the invention typically has very similar elasticity modulus and viscosity.<br>
Synovial liquid, being a fluid, has a very long relaxation time (about 100 sec). The relaxation time is defined as the time required for the stress to decay to 37% of its initial value in a stress relaxation experiment. This long relaxation time implies that for fast movements (when the stress is applied rapidly), it responds as a very elastic material, whereas at low speed stresses it behaves like a lubricating oil. Low viscosity formulations of the hydrogel of the invention are fluid-like, such as when homogenised, and as fluids, have the very long relaxation time and the fluid like properties of synovial liquid. The present invention thus provides for an excellent alternative to known technologies for replacing synovial liquid, such as injections with isotonic (NaCI) water which lasts for only 1-3 days, or injection with solutions of hyaluronic acid, which faces resorption problems.<br>
As stated, in embodiments wherein the hydrogel is as a low viscosity formulation, the hydrogel attempts to mimic, at least in part, the features of synovial liquid. In embodiments where the hydrogel is of higher viscosity formulation, such as a viscosity above 10 Pa s, such as above 15 Pa s, the hydrogel mimics more the combined features of synovial liquid and cartilage in that the hydrogels are more elastic materials with infinite relaxation times.<br>
Iin terms of resilience to mechanical stress, the hydrogel of the invention has demonstrated complete full resilient behaviour. Moreover, the elastic feature of the liydrogel allows it to retum to its start position when the stress is released in creep experiments.<br>
the device may be administered into an array of intra-articular cavities where said joint or cartilage present in said joint may need increased lubrication, increased weight bearing capacity, or increased protection of the opposing bones of the joint, such as but not<br><br>
limited to the group comprising of the knee joint; hip joint; the elbow, the metacarpal-phalangeal and interphalangeal joints in hands and feet (please comment as to other relevant joints).<br>
In the administration of the device to the patient, the adequate placing and position of the hydrogel is of great relevance. To assist in the positioning of the gel, visualisation of the location of the device is useful to the individual performing the procedure. It may be advantageous, such as in the embodiment wherein the device is administered by injection to visualise the device in order to establish its position and the amount required. Visualisation of the hydrogel during administration may be facilitated by radio-labelling of the hydrogel. Thus, in one interesting embodiment, the hydrogel is radio-labelled.<br>
As stated, surface treatment of the hydrogel may assist device to be held in place within the joint cavity. However, in the embodiment of an injectable hydrogel, the device may be held by the bone tissue which defines the boundaries of the cavity into which the gel was injected.<br>
As also stated, one aspect of the invention relates to the use of a hydrogel comprising about 0.5 to 25% by weight polyacrylamide, based on the total weight of the hydrogel, for the preparation of an endoprosthesis for alleviation or prevention of symptoms associated with arthritis. Correspondingly, the method of the invention may be defined as a method of treating or preventing arthritis comprising administering a hydrogel to a mammal said hydrogel comprising 0.5 to 25% by weight polyacrylamide, based on the total weight of the hydrogel. The method comprises the use of the hydrogel as defined supra and to the use of the prosthetic device as defined supra.<br>
The method may comprise a first series or treatment session of injections or implantations followed by an analysis, evaluation or trial of the degree of assistance provided by the device and followed by further series or treatment sessions if required. In the embodiment wherein the joint required primarily increased weight bearing capacity, the elasticity or support provided by the device may diminish with time. However, one advantage of the method of the invention is that an injectable formulation of the prosthetic device may be administered to supplement the existing device. This procedure may be repeated as often as required by the patient to alleviate the pain associated with the condition. Similarly, in the event that the device was administered primarily to increase lubrication in the joint,<br><br>
and that the lubrication capacity of the device has diminished with time, the method of the invention, such as by simple injection may be repeated as required.<br>

The invention is further disclosed by the Examples which are not intended to be limiting in any way.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Hydrogel<br>
The gel is a polyacrylamide gel manufaclured by a polymerisation of the monomers of acrylamide and N.N'-methylene-bis-acrylamJde. The finished product may have different viscosities.<br>
The hydrogel has the empirical formula [CaHsNOjxIC/HioN-OoJy and the structural formula as shown in Figure 1<br><br>
The hydrogel typically contains approximately 95% water. The concentration of the monomers acrylamide and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide has been shown to be less than 10 ppm and is adequate for the desired stability of the final product, often less than 5 ppm.<br>
The finished product must conform with respect to pH, absence of heavy metals, refractive index, stability, absence of pyrogens, and must be sterile, practically inert, and be substantially free of monomers.<br><br>
Preparation 1.1<br>
The synthetic preparation suitably involves the following operations:<br>
1.	Two mixtures, A1 and A2, are prepared. A1 comprises vyater, acrylamide, N.N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide, N,N,N',N'-tetramethylene-ethylene-diamine (TEMED). A2 comprises water and ammonium persulphate;<br>
2.	The two mixtures are combined in the following ratio: 1990 mL of A1 and 10 mL of A2 and kept at 45 °C and degassed with nitrogen for 20 seconds;<br>
3.	The reaction mixture is cast into several 100 mL beakers;<br>
4.	Polymerisation is allowed to occur for 0.5 to 1.5 hours;<br>
5.	The gel is demolded;<br>
6.	Residual monomers are extracted and with equilibration in WFI water for 92 hours, changing the water several times, typically 8 times during the 92 hours;<br>
7.	The purified gels are homogenised by grinding with an vertically oscillating grid; 8.The syringe is filled with the homogenised gel material;<br>
9. Autoclavation of the syringe<br>
\ typical method for preparing the hydrogel may be summarised as:<br>
Preparation 1.2<br>
Process summary: The gel is prepared by mixing an aqueous monomer solution of acrylamide (AM) and N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide (BISAM) as cross-linker with N,N,N',N'-tetramethylene ethylene diamine (TMED) as co-initiator and ammoniumpersuifate (APS) as free-radical initiator (redox-system). By degassing a bulk solution with nitrogen polymerisation starts. After final polymerisation the gel transferred into a washing tank with net trays onto which the gel is placed. During water washing the gel swells and monomer residues are extracted. The swollen gel is fed and evacuated in a filling unit having the gel delivered in a syringe, which is autoclaved.<br>
Two alternate formulations have been prepared, a lower- and a higher- end viscosity formulation. Both formulations have a solid weight content of less than 3.5% and a complex viscosity in the range of 2 to 50 Pa s, typically between 3 and 20 Pa s.<br><br><br>
The above are (ypical preparations of (he hydrogel and may be adjusted within certain ranges.<br>
Preparation 1.3<br>
Polyacrylamide formulations from inline cross-linking process<br>
A particularly interesting method of preparing the hydrogels of the invention involves an I   inline cross-linking process. Two individual and eventually degassed flows, one being a pre-mix of acrylic amide, bis-methylene acryl amide (the cross-linker) and TEMED, the other being the AMPS initiator solution, are pumped into a static mixer for mixing, chemical initiation and subsequent extrusion downstream into a pipe reactor made of Teflon or steel in which the polymerisation occurs. Washing of the gel is simplified due to high surface area of gel from re'actor.<br>
By selecting monomer, cross-linker and initiator concentrations and their relative molar ratios, and by regulating the two flow rates and the polymerisation temperatures, it is possible to produce gels that are varying in degree of crosslinking and in solids content.<br><br>
Preparation 1.4<br>
The reagents were combined in raiios described in Tables 2. 3 and 4, and washed as described in the Tables (with pyrogen-free water unless indicated otherwise) to give low, medium, and high viscosity formulations. Hydrogels with solid weight contents between 0.5 and 25% polyacrylamide were prepared.<br><br><br><br>
a)	material was liquid so washing was a dilution<br>
b)	infinite<br>
c)	since v/ashing was not an extraction but a dilution, the residual monomer was merely decreased by the dilution factor (508 ppm to 254 ppm).<br>
d)	casting and washing done using 0.9% NaCI aqueous solution<br>
e)	casting with water, washing done using 0.9% NaCI aqueous solution<br>
f)	pre-wash values - washing typically reduces value by 30-55%<br>
g)	pre-eash values - washing typically reduces value by 20-40% h) highly notch sensitive<br>
