				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a ground cover for cultivation of plants and to a method<br>
of providing anchoring formations for plants.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a ground cover for cultivation<br>
of plants, the ground cover including<br>
a membrane strip having a side which in use is an upper side; and<br>
anchoring formations on the upper side of the membrane strip for assisting a plant in the<br>
vicinity of the ground cover to anchor itself to the ground cover.<br>
The membrane strip may be water impervious and it may be light impervious, at least to<br>
some degree, as required. Typically, the membrane strip is of polyethylene material. The<br>
membrane strip may be of conventional agricultural sheeting, e.g. any of the membranes<br>
or sheets supplied by Polyon Agricultural Sheeting of Kibbutz Barkai, M.P. Menashe<br>
37860 Israel.<br>
The membrane strip may have a thickness of between about 15 mm and about 40 mm,<br>
typically between about 15 mm and about 37 mm, e.g. about 20 mm.<br>
The membrane strip may have a length of at least 500m, typically at least 1000 m, e.g.<br>
about 1000 m.<br>
The membrane strip may have a width of between about 0.5 m and about 2.5 m, typically<br>
between about 1 m and about 1.5 m, e.g. about 1,2 m.<br>
The anchoring formations may be defined by a net. The net may be attached, e.g.<br>
adhesively attached or physically connected such as by means of a temperature and / or<br>
pressure process when the net is also of synthetic plastics material, as<br>
described hereinafter, to the membrane strip at a plurality of spaced locations, allowing the<br>
net to be displaceable away from the membrane strip, in areas where the net is not<br>
attached to the membrane strip. Typically, the net is attached to the membrane strip along<br>
two longitudinally extending zones. Each zone may have a width of between about 2 cm<br>
and about 25 cm, typically between about 5 cm and about 15 cm, e.g. about 10 cm.<br>
Typically, the longitudinally extending zones are adjacent respective longitudinally<br>
extending edges of the membrane strip, leaving a central, longitudinally extending zone of<br>
the net displaceable away from the membrane strip.<br>
Apertures defined by the net may be rectangular. Major sides of each<br>
rectangular aperture may extend longitudinally relative to the membrane strip.<br>
Each aperture defined by the net may have a length of between about 2.5 cm<br>
and about 15 cm, typically between about 5 cm and about 10 cm, e.g. about 8 cm.<br>
Each aperture defined by the net may have a width of between about 1.5 cm<br>
and about 15 cm, typically between about 2.5 cm and about 10 cm, e.g. about 8 cm.<br>
The net may be of a synthetic plastics or polymeric material, e.g.<br>
polyethylene or polypropylene. Preferably, the net is of a material which is UV-stabilized.<br>
The net may be of strands having a thickness of between about 0.2 mm and<br>
about 3 mm, typically between about 0.3 mm and about 0.5 mm, e.g. about 0.45 mm.<br>
The membrane strip may define at least one aperture therethrough for<br>
receiving a plant. Thus, in use, a plant typically grows through the aperture in the<br>
membrane strip and anchors itself to the ground cover.<br>
The membrane strip may define a plurality of longitudinally spaced apertures.<br>
The apertures may be equidistantly spaced and may be located on a longitudinally<br>
extending centre line of the membrane strip. Although the ground cover may be supplied<br>
in the trade with the apertures, it is to be appreciated that it may be more convenient for a<br>
user of the ground cover simply to punch or tear holes in the membrane strip in the number<br>
and locations required by the user.<br>
The ground cover may be in the form of a roll, comprising a ply consisting of<br>
the membrane strip and another ply consisting of the anchoring formations.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
providing anchoring formations for plants, the method including<br>
laying a ground cover as hereinbefore described on a strip of ground; and<br>
securing the ground cover to the ground.<br>
Laying the ground cover may include unrolling the membrane strip and the<br>
anchoring formations from a roll, comprising a ply of the membrane strip and a ply of the<br>
anchoring formations.<br>
Securing the ground cover to the ground may include securing longitudinally<br>
extending zones adjacent respective longitudinally extending edges of the ground cover to<br>
the ground. This may be effected by temporarily holding down a portion of an edge on the<br>
ground and piling soil onto the held-down portion of the edge.<br>
The method may include providing a tunnel or shelter over the ground cover.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
providing anchoring formations for plants, the method including<br>
laying a membrane strip having a side which in use is an upper side on a strip of<br>
ground;<br>
laying anchoring formations on the upper side of the membrane strip; and<br>
securing the membrane strip and the anchoring formations to the ground.<br>
The membrane strip and the anchoring formations may be laid on the ground<br>
simultaneously, and may be as hereinbefore described.<br>
The method may include providing a roll, comprising a ply of the membrane<br>
strip and a ply of anchoring formations, and unrolling the membrane strip and the<br>
anchoring formations simultaneously to lay them simultaneously on the ground.<br>
Securing the membrane strip and the anchoring formations to the ground<br>
may include securing longitudinally extending zones adjacent respective longitudinally<br>
extending edges of the membrane strip and a body defining the anchoring formations to<br>
the ground. This may be effected by temporarily holding down a portion of an edge of both<br>
of the membrane strip and the anchoring formations and piling soil onto the held-down<br>
portions of the edges.<br>
The method may include providing a tunnel or shelter over the membrane<br>
strip and the anchoring formations.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the<br>
accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which<br>
Figure 1 shows a three-dimensional view of a portion of a ground cover in<br>
accordance with the invention; and<br>
Figure 2 shows a three-dimensional view of the portion of the ground cover of Figure<br>
1, in use.<br>
Referring to the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a ground<br>
cover in accordance with the invention, only a portion of which is shown. The ground cover<br>
10 includes a membrane strip 12 with a side 14 which in use is an upper side, and a net<br>
16, the strands 18 of which define anchoring formations.<br>
The net 16 is located on and covers the upper side 14 of the membrane strip<br>
12. Two longitudinally extending, ten cm wide edge portions of the net 16 are adhesively<br>
attached to similar edge portions 17 of the membrane strip 12. Thus, a longitudinally<br>
extending central area or zone of the net 16 is not directly attached to the membrane strip<br>
12, but only by means of the edge portions. The central area or zone is thus free to move<br>
away, at least to a limited extent, from the membrane strip 12, allowing plant tentacles to<br>
grow inbetween the net 16 and the membrane strip 12.<br>
The membrane strip 12 is water impervious and light impervious, and is of<br>
polyethylene material. It has a thickness of about 20 mm, a width of about 1,2 m and a<br>
length of about 1000 m.<br>
Rectangular apertures or rectangular blocks 19 defined by the net 16 each<br>
has a length of about 8 cm and a width of about 8 cm. The net 16 is arranged relative to<br>
the membrane strip 12 such that the apertures or blocks 19 defined by the net 16 have<br>
their shorter sides transverse to the membrane strip 12.<br>
The net 16 is of polyethylene or polypropylene material. A typical example of<br>
a suitable net 16 is a net supplied under the trade name Netlon Palnet, available from<br>
African Commerce Developing Company (Proprietary) Limited of Dacres Avenue, Epping<br>
2, Eppingdust, Cape Town, Republic of South Africa.<br>
The ground cover 10 is supplied in the form of a two-ply roll (not shown), one<br>
ply consisting of the membrane strip 12 and the other ply consisting of the net 16.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, instead of the edge portions of the<br>
net 16 being adhesively attached to the edge portions 17 of the membrane strip, the edge<br>
portions of the net may be physically attached to the edge portions of the membrane strip,<br>
such as by means of a high temperature and/or high pressure process e.g. by means of<br>
welding.<br>
In use, the ground cover 10 is laid on the ground by unrolling the membrane<br>
strip 12 and the net 16 from the two-ply roll. Typically, the ground cover 10 is laid over a<br>
linearly extending ridge or hump, with a centre line of the ground cover 10 being located on<br>
a longitudinally extending centre line of the ridge or hump. Typically, an irrigation pipe or<br>
the like (not shown) is located underneath the membrane strip 12 but, as will be<br>
appreciated, the exact arrangement may depend on the kind of plants for which the ground<br>
cover 10 is intended to be used.<br>
The ground cover 10 may be laid using a conventional machine for the laying<br>
of conventional ground covers for the cultivation of plants. Thus, the unrolling membrane<br>
strip 12 and net 16 may be temporarily held down by a pair of spaced wheels pressing<br>
down on the edge portions 17, whilst ploughshares may throw two rows 20 of soil onto the<br>
edge portions 17.<br>
A plurality of apertures (only one of which is shown) is formed in the<br>
membrane strip 12, by simply pushing holes through the membrane strip 12. The<br>
apertures are typically located on the centre line of the membrane strip 12 and are spaced<br>
a desired distance from each other. Plants to be cultivated are then planted, one in each<br>
aperture. Typically, the ground cover 10 is used for plants with tentacles, such as<br>
watermelon or cantaloupe. The plants growing through the apertures find it easy to attach<br>
or anchor themselves to the net 16, as shown in Figure 2 of the drawings.<br>
The use of a ground cover, comprising only a membrane strip, is known to<br>
the applicant. Membrane strip ground covers have a number of advantages, including that<br>
fruit ripens earlier and more evenly, fruit can be harvested over a longer period, and less<br>
chemical pest control is required. By also supplying anchoring formations on the upper<br>
side of the membrane strip, thereby assisting cultivated plants to anchor themselves to the<br>
ground cover 10, the ground cover 10, as illustrated, also provides the following<br>
advantages: due to the anchoring of tentacles of the plant, wind damage to the plant is<br>
reduced; plants are less acceptable to fungi, infections and stress when they are less<br>
disturbed; immature fruits are not moved about, which reduces abrasions and loss of fruit;<br>
natural wind breaks are sufficient to prevent wind damage to the plants and fruit and it is<br>
thus not necessary to erect artificial windbreaks, lowering input capital; the net 16<br>
strengthens the membrane strip 12, inhibiting wind damage to the membrane strip 12 and<br>
thus allowing thinner membrane strips to be used and use of the ground cover 10 for a<br>
second harvest during the same season; and more mature fruit is produced per hectare,<br>
leading to higher nett income per hectare.<br>
Some of the abovementioned advantages are illustrated by the following<br>
results from experiments conducted by the applicant.<br>
EXPERIMENT 1<br>
An experiment was conducted at Ou Tuin, Doringrivier, District Clanwilliam in<br>
South Africa to investigate the effect of the invention on the cultivation of watermelon and<br>
cantaloupe compared to other ground treatment strategies. This area is subject to wind<br>
damage of plants. The watermelon variety used was Carmen and the cantaloupe variety<br>
used was Aphrodite. The membrane used with the watermelon was a brown plastics<br>
sheet, whereas the membrane used with the cantaloupe was a black plastics sheet.<br>
Observations on the leaf growth were made 8 weeks (Table 1) and 10 weeks (Table 2)<br>
after planting. The Tables show the number of fully grown permanent leaves per plant.<br>
Data for each repeat shows the average for 17 plants.<br>
It is clear from Tables 1 and 2 that initial growth of leaves is strongest inside<br>
the tunnel and it was markedly stronger for watermelon than cantaloupe, possibly because<br>
the watermelon was established from plants, whereas the cantaloupe was established from<br>
seed. The plastics sheet, with and without the net, also had a significant effect on the<br>
number of fully grown leaves, compared to bare ground only, as shown by Tables 1 and 2.<br>
After 10 weeks, the use of a plastics sheet in combination with the net, for watermelon,<br>
showed improved results compared to the use of a plastics sheet only. It appeared that<br>
the most prominent advantage of the use of the net with the plastics sheet is not to<br>
increase the number of leaves per plant, but rather to improve the effectiveness of the<br>
leaves. This can possibly be explained by the fact that anchoring of the tentacles of the<br>
plants to the net has the effect that the leaves can maintain a fixed orientation relative to<br>
the sun in contrast with unanchored plants which are subject to continual movement by the<br>
wind, causing changes in orientation of the leaves relative to the sun. Leaves are often<br>
turned upside down so that the leaf stems have to recompensate for incorrect orientation<br>
of the leaves relative to the sun. This problem is particularly severe on smooth plastics<br>
sheets. After 10 weeks, the number of tentacles per plant anchored to the net was 8 for<br>
watermelon and 0.46 for cantaloupe. This difference can possibly again be explained by<br>
the fact that the cantaloupe was established from seed whereas the watermelon was<br>
established from plants.<br>
Measurements were also taken to determine the effect of the different ground<br>
treatment strategies on the fruit-bearing capacity of the watermelon and the cantaloupe.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3 and indicate the number of fruits per plant after about 14<br>
weeks. For cantaloupe, fruits larger than 8 cm were counted and for watermelon, fruits<br>
larger than 15 cm in length were counted. The values given are the average of 17 plants.<br>
Table 4 shows the results (number of fruits/plant) after about 20 weeks.<br>
It is clear that the combination of the plastics sheet with the net has a marked<br>
effect on the fruit-bearing capacity of both watermelon and cantaloupe, particularly in<br>
combination with a tunnel, particularly when compared to bare ground.<br>
Table 5 illustrates the effect of the ground treatment method on average fruit<br>
diameter (in mm) after about 20 weeks.<br>
As can be seen, for watermelon there was enough variation in fruit size in<br>
order to, in addition to fruit-bearing capacity, affect the mass of harvested fruit. For<br>
cantaloupe, this variation was relatively small and it is thus the fruit-bearing capacity in the<br>
case of cantaloupe which will have the largest effect on the yield of the cantaloupe harvest.<br>
The effect of the ground treatment method on harvest yield was calculated (in<br>
tons per hectare). The following factors were used in calculating yields: the number of<br>
fruits for watermelon was limited to fruits longer than 15 cm, and for cantaloupe to fruits<br>
longer than 8 cm for one trial row of 17 trial plants per planting. Average fruit diameter is<br>
calculated as the sum of the length diameter and the width diameter divided by two for 16<br>
fruits from one representative trial row per planting. The calculated weight per fruit was<br>
determined by weighing 15 fruits over the whole range of fruit sizes and preparing a graph<br>
of the relationship of the average fruit diameter against the average fruit weight.<br>
Calculated harvest yield per hectare was then calculated as follows: number of fruits per<br>
plant after 20 weeks multiplied by the calculated average weight per fruit multiplied by<br>
10000 plants per hectare divided by 1000, to give calculated harvest yield in ton per<br>
hectare. The results are shown in Table 6 below.<br>
It is clear from Table 6, that the use of the net with a plastics sheet (with or<br>
without the use of a tunnel), has markedly improved calculated harvest yields for both<br>
watermelon and cantaloupe, compared to bare ground and the use of a plastics sheet only.<br>
This is probably a reflection of the negative effects of wind damage in the area where the<br>
trials were conducted and the ability of the net to limit wind damage. The use of plastics<br>
sheeting alone improved calculated harvest yield for watermelon by only 13.2 %, compared<br>
to 75.6 % for cantaloupe. It is suspected that an unidentified factor in the form of a harmful<br>
organism infestation affected the watermelon covered by the plastics sheet only, causing<br>
the watermelon not to reach its full potential.<br>
Observations were made to determine the effect of the different ground<br>
treatment strategies on the possibility of an early harvest. The results are shown in Table 7<br>
below, which indicates the number of fruit that ripened first per trial row of 17 plants, after<br>
about 20 weeks.<br>
The improvement when using plastics sheet combined with a net in respect of<br>
watermelon is very clear from Table 7. For cantaloupe, the improvement is also marked<br>
when a plastics sheet, a net and a tunnel are used, compared to bare ground. It was also<br>
observed that surface damage of young fruit as a result of movement caused by wind was<br>
at least 50 % higher for those ground treatments strategies which did not include a net, for<br>
both watermelon and cantaloupe.<br>
EXPERIMENT 2<br>
An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of the colour of the<br>
plastics sheet on the growth rate of watermelon and cantaloupe. Measurements of the<br>
number of fully grown permanent leaves in one row of 30 plants were taken after 8 weeks<br>
and 10 weeks. Each planting consisted of 100 plants. The results are shown in the<br>
following Table 8.<br>
It is clear that, after 10 weeks, stronger stimulation of growth occurred<br>
underneath the brown plastics sheet than the black plastics sheet for both watermelon and<br>
cantaloupe. At this stage, there were 18.9 % more fully grown leaves under the brown<br>
plastics sheet for watermelon and 27.2 % more fully grown leaves for the cantaloupe.<br>
The effect of the colour of the plastics sheet on calculated harvest yield was<br>
calculated. Calculations were done on the same basis as for Table 6, although fruit size<br>
measurements were taken for 100 plants for both watermelon and cantaloupe. The results<br>
are reflected below in Table 9.<br>
EXPERIMENT 3<br>
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of the ground<br>
treatment strategies on sand blasting damage of young plants of Honey Chow cantaloupe<br>
cultivar. The plants were planted in such a manner that from repeat 1 to repeat 3 the<br>
plants were progressively more exposed to wind blown sand. This effect was promoted by<br>
judicious use of a reed windbreak. The following Table 10 illustrates the results 3 weeks<br>
and 5 weeks after planting.<br>
The positive effect of the use of a plastics sheet in combination with a net is<br>
clearly illustrated in Table 10. It was further observed that, where a plastics sheet was<br>
used without a net, the wind eroded soil from the edges of the sheet with the result that the<br>
plastics sheet was torn and blown to one side, particularly in respect of repeat 3. This<br>
problem did not occur where the plastics sheet was used in combination with the net, as<br>
the wind did not erode the soil from the net allowing the net to anchor the plastics sheet.<br>
