Method to increase resistance against stain penetration of aqueous coating composi¬tions<br>
The present invention relates to a method for improving staining properties of aqueous coating compositions.<br>
For reasons of environmental protection and occupational hygiene, modern coating compositions such as emulsion paints and architectural or decorative coatings, for example, contain a binder formulation based on an aqueous polymer dispersion or an aqueous polymer latex, respectively. The polymer particles present in the polymer dispersion coalesce on drying thereby binding any pigment particles and fillers present and forming the coating. The formation of a uniform polymeric film and thus stable coating is only ensured, however, when the coating composition is processed at a temperature which lies above the minimum film-forming temperature of the polymer in the binder formulation. If the film formation is hinderd the resulting coatings have only poor mechanical strength and thus poor scrub and wash resistance. This problem becomes more pronounced at high pigment to binder ratios in particular for coating compositions having a pigment volume concentration pvc &gt; 50 % or even pvc &gt; 60 %. The pigment volume concentration PVC, here and below, is 100 times the ratio of the total volume of pigments plus fillers divided by the total volume of pigments, fillers and binder polymers; cf. Ullmanns Enzyklopadie d. Techn. Chem., 4th ed., vol. 15, p. 667.<br>
70<br>
A low minimum film-forming temperature is ensured in principle when using binders whose polymers have a low glass transition temperature. However, these binders have the disadvantage that the polymer film remains soft and is tacky. This, in turn, has the consequences for the coating of low blocking resistance, high soiling tendency and poor wash and burnish resistance. Alternatively, the minimum film-forming temperature of a polymeric binder may be lowered by processing it with film-forming auxiliaries (coalescents). These are volatile organic compounds, examples being solvents or plasticizers, which when the coating is dried facilitate film formation, initially, and on further drying are emitted to the environment, thereby increasing the surface hardness of the polymer film and reducing its tackiness. Volatile coalescents, however, entail an unwanted burden on the environment.<br>
Another problem associated with aqueous coating compositions is the low resistance of the obtained coatings against penetration by and difficulty of removal of aqueous stains such as coffee, red wine, aqueous inks, and the like. It is assumed that the pigments in the coatings faciliate the penetration of the aqueous stains into the coatings, so that the<br><br>
stains can not be removed any longer. Most commercial paints have only poor stain resistance.<br>
Further it is known that paints with poor wash (washing surface with sponge and soap solution), scrub (scrubbing surface with sponge, scourer or brush and a soap or scrubbing solution containing abrasives) or burnish resistance (polishing the surface with a dry sponge, cloth, brush or surface) show good stain resistance, however as the paint film is damaged in this process, indicated by a visually preclevable increase in gloss or erosion of the film, the performance is not acceptable to the consumer. This is because the cleaned area is different to the uncleaned area of the coating, highlighting it.<br>
WO 98/10026 suggests to improve stain removal of waterborne coating compositions by chosing a anionically stabilised polymer dispersion as a binder, which polymer comprises acrylic acid or methacrylic acid, at least one vinylaromatic monomer and at least one C2-C12 acrylic ester.<br>
EP-A 614 955 refers to a stain resistant latex paint comprising a styrene containing copolymer latex having a glass transition temperature of greater than 21°C  and less than 95°C , a hiding pigment and a non-cellulosic thickener.<br>
W099/46337 describes an aqueous polymer dispersion containing an emulsifier with phosphate groups, however it focuses on corrosion and block resistance of the coatings and does not investigate the effect on stain resistance.<br>
There is an ongoing need for pigment containing aqueous coating compositions which have good staining properties, in particular good staining resistance and penetration resistance against stains, and which also ensure uniform film formation at low concentrations of coalescence auxiliaries.<br>
It has surprisingly been found by the inventors of the present application, that these and other objects could be solved by pigment containing aqueous coating compositions based on polymer latex binders comprising at least one anionic surfactant, which comprises at least 85 % by weight, preferably at least 90 % by weight, more preferably at least 95 % by weight, based on the total weight of anionic surfactant in the coating composition, of at least one specific surfactants S as defined herein below . In particular the surfactants S should contain no or only small oligo-C2-C3-alkylene-ether groups having at most 15 C2-C3-alkylene oxide repeating units in the oligo-C2-C3-alkylene-ether group.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention relates to the use of such a coating composition for improv¬ing (or increasing) staining resistance and penetration resistance. The invention also relates to a method for improving (or increasing) stain resistance and penetration resis¬tance of aqueous coating compositions which method comprises providing a coating composition which contain at least one pigment, at least one film-forming polymer in the form of an aqueous polymer dispersion and at least one anionic surfactant, wherein the anionic surfactant comprises at least 85 % by weight, preferably at least 90 % by weight, more preferably at least 95 % by weight, based on the total weight of anionic surfactant in the coating composition, of at least one anionic surfactant S, which is se¬lected from semi-esters of sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid with an alcohol, which alco¬hol carries at least one alkyl radical having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms or an alkyl sub¬stituted phenyl radical wherein alkyl has from 4 to 30 carbon atoms and which alcohol may carry an oligo-C2-C3-alkylene-ether group provided that the number of repeating units in the oligo-C2-C3-alkylene-ether group is at most 15, or a salt thereof.<br>
The term "stain resistance" is understood as the ability of the coating to reduce staining when getting into contact with stains, in particular with liquid stains and more preferably aqueous stains such as ink, coloured beverage such as red wine, juice, coffee, tee and the like. The term "penetration resistance" is understood as the ability of the coating to reduce or prevent penetration of stains, in particular liquid stains more preferably aqueous stains into the coating. A skilled person will thus understand the terms" im¬proving stain resistance"   and " improving penetration resistance"   as an increase in these properties, i.e. as a reduction of staining and a reduction of penetration of stains into the coating, respectively.<br>
The use of surfactants S instead of conventional surfactants improve the staining prop¬erties of the pigment containing coatings, which are obtained, when a pigment contain¬ing coating composition as defined above, is applied to a substrate to be coated and dried. In particular, they reduce the penetration of hydrophilic liquid stains Into the dry coating. Moreover, the incorporation of the surfactant S does not noticeably affect ad¬versely the stability of the coating, i.e. the wash, scrub or burnishing resistance of the coating.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants S comprise at least one alkyl radical having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, in particular from 10 to 25 carbon atoms and more preferably from 12 to 24 carbon atoms and most preferably from 14 to 22 carbon atoms or at least one alkyl-phenyl radical having from 4 to 30, in particular from 6 to 25 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety. The alkyl radicals may be linear or branched and may be saturated or may con-<br><br>
tain 1, 2 or 3 ethylenically unsaturated double bonds. Preferably, the aliphatic radical is an alkyl radical which is linear or has at most one branching unit. Preferred aliphatic radicals are saturated, i.e. they do not contain double bonds. The aliphatic radical may be directly linked to the anionic group or via a spacer, e.g. by a phenyl group or by an oligo-C2-C3-alkylene ether group, provided that the number of C2-C3-alkylene oxide repeating units in the oligo-C2-C3-alkylene ether group does not exceed 15, in particular 12 and more preferably 10. In a particular preferred embodiment the number of al¬kylene oxide repeating units is from 2 to 15, in particular from 2 to 12 more preferably from 2 to 10. It might be advantageous to use a surfactant S, wherein the number of alkylene oxide repeating units is from 0 to 8, in particular from 0 to 5, e.g. 0 or 1 or from 2 to 8 or from 2 to 5. However, it might also be advantageous, if the number of alkylene oxide repeating units is from 5 to 12 or from 5 to 10.<br>
Examples of suitable aliphatic radicals comprise n-octyl, 1-methylheptyl, 2-methylheptyl, 2-ethylhexyl, n-nonyl, 1-methyloctyl, n-decyl, 2-propylheptyl, n-undecyl, 1-methyldecyl, lauryl, 1-tridecyl, 1-methyldodecyl (isotridecyl), 1-tetradecyl, 1-pentadecyl, 1-hexadecyl (cetyl), 1-octadecyl (stearyl), 9-octadecen-1-yl (oleyl), linoleyl, linolenyl, 1-nonadecyl, 1-eicosyl, 1-heneicosly, 1-docosyl, 13-docosen-1-yl, lignoceryl, ceryl and myricyl.<br>
The anionic group in the surfactant S may be a sulfate (SO4) group or a phosphate (PO4) group which may be in the acid form or preferably in the neutralized (i.e. anionic) form.<br>
In case the anionic group of the surfactant S is present in the neutralized form the ani¬onic surfactant comprises cations as counter ions. Suitable cations comprise in particu¬lar the alkali metal ions, such as lithium, sodium and/or potassium, and ammonium (NH4+) with preference given to sodium and potassium.<br>
Suitable surfactant salts of the sulfated type include sodium and or potassium. They are widely commercially available under a range of tradenames including but not limited to Gardinol®, Texapon®, Disponil® (Cognis), Lutensit® (BASF) Emulan®, Lutensol® (BASF AG), Maranil ®,Sulfopon, and include surfactants with various levels of alkylene ether groups and aliphatic radicals as described above.<br>
Suitable surfactants of the phosphated type are usually monoesters or diesters of phosphoric acid with the respective alcohol. They might be pure monoester or diester or mixtures of the mono- and diester, optionally with non-reacted alcohol. Preferably the anionic phosphate ester comprises the monoester as a major constituent. Most<br><br>
commercial phosphate esters are, however, mixtures of mono- and diesters and unre-acted alcohol. Anionic phosphate esters are principally known in the art and they can be obtained commercially, e.g. under the trade marks ALKANATE® and TERIC ® (from Huntsman Corporation company), ORISURF® (Sino-Japan Chemical Company), Maphos © , Lutensit® (from BASF AG), Hydropalat (Cognis), Rhodafac® (Rhodia).<br>
Generally, the surfactant S is non-polymerizable, i.e. the surfactant S does not contain ethylenically unsaturated double bonds.<br>
Preferred anionic surfactants S are those, wherein the anionic surfactant is of the for-mulae la or lb:<br>
M3-n[O4-nP-(O-(Alk-)O)mR)n]       (la)<br>
M[O3S-O-(Alk-O)mR]    (lb)<br>
wherein<br>
n       is 1 or 2, in particular 1 to 1,5;<br>
m      is an integer from 0 to 15, in particular from 0 to 12 in particular from 0 to 10.<br>

A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to the use of surfactants of the formu¬lae la or lb, wherein m is from 0 to 15, in particular from 0 to 12 and more preferably from 0 to 10 and the groups A-O, if present, comprise at least 50% by weight, more preferably at least 80 % by weight, based on the total weight of the groups A-O, groups of the formula CH2CH2O. In particular, all or nearly all of the group A-O, if present, are of the formula CH2CH2O. In a particularly preferred embodiment, m in formulae la or lb is 0 or 1. In another preferred embodiment, m in formulae la or lb is from 2 to 15, in particular from 2 to 12 and more preferably from 2 to 10 or from 2 to 8 or from 2 to 5. In another embodiment m in formulae la or lb is from 5 to 12 or from 5 to 10.<br>
In order to achieve the desired staining properties, the surfactant S is present in an effective amount, which is preferably from 0.1 to 4 % by weight, in particular from 0,2 to 2 % by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 2 % by weight based on the polymer binder in the coating.<br>
The surfactant S can be incorporated in the coating composition at any stage of its preparation or into the binder. For example, the anionic surfactant S can be incorpo¬rated into the binder in the course of the preparation of the binder, i.e. in the polymeri¬sation process, which is described below. The anionic surfactant S can also be incor¬porated into the binder after its preparation, which is preferred. The anionic surfactant S and the binder may also be incorporated separately into the coating composition.<br>
According to the invention, the coating compositions contain a polymeric binder in the form of an aqueous polymer dispersion or polymer latex, respectively. Here and in the following, the terms polymer dispersion, polymer latex and polymer emulsion are syno¬nyms and refer to aqueous dispersions of fine polymer particles which are dispersed in an aqueous phase. Polymer dispersions which are suitable as binders in waterborne coating compositions have been comprehensively described in the literature, e.g. by J.C. Padget, J. Coatings Technology, Vol 66, 839, 1994, pp 89 -101; M. Schwartz, R. Baumstark "Waterbased Acrylates for Decorative Coatings" Curt R. Vincentz Veriag Hannover 2001.<br>
The properties of the coating composition may also depend on the glass transition temperature (DSC, midpoint temperature, ASTM D 3418-82) of the copolymer S. If the glass transition temperature is too low, the coating is not very strong and tears when<br><br>
subjected to a mechanical load. If it is too high, the polymer no longer forms a film and the coating, consequently, is of reduced wet abrasion resistance. The glass transition temperature of the binder polymers preferably does not exceed 50°C , in particular 30°C and more preferably 20°C . In general, however, the glass transition temperature is at least -10°C, in particular at least 0°C . It proves useful in this context that the glass tran¬sition temperature Tg of the dispersed polymer can be estimated by means of the equa¬tion of Fox (T.G. Fox, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. (Ser. II) 1. [1956] 123) based upon the monomer composition of the polymer and from the glass transition temperature of the homopolymers of those monomers forming the polymer. The latter are known, for ex¬ample, from Ullmann'  s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, VCH, Weinheim, Vol. A 21 (1992) p. 169 or from J. Brandrup, E.H. Immergut, Polymer Handbook 3rd ed., J. Wiley, New York 1989.<br>
The polymeric binder is usually constructed from ethylenically unsaturated monomers M. In general, monomers M comprise from 80 to 99,9 % by weight, in particular from 90 to 99,5 % by weight and more preferably from 95 to 99 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers M, of monoethylenically unsaturated neutral monomers having a water solubility below 30 g/L at 25 °C and 1 bar. Additionally, the polymeric binder usu¬ally comprises at least one further monomer which is selected from monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, which are ionic and/or have a water solubility of at least 50 g/1 at 25 °C  and 1 bar. The amount of these monomers usually does not exceed 20 % by weight and is in particular from 0.1 to 20 % by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 10 % by weight and more preferably from 1 to 5 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers M. Monomers M may further comprise polyethylenically unsaturated mono¬mers and crossiinking monomers. The amount of these monomers usually does not exceed 5 % by weight of the monomers M. In particular the amount of these monomers does not exceed 0.5 % by weight.<br>
Monoethylenically unsaturated neutral monomers Ml having a water solubility below 30 g/L include e.g. vinylaromatic monomers, such as styrene, a-methylstyrene, o-chlorostyrene or vinyltoluenes, the vinyl esters of aliphatic C2-C18 monocarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl valerate, vinyl hexanoate, vinyl 2-ethylhexanoate, vinyl decanoate. vinyl pivalate, vinyl laurate, vinylversatates, vinyl stearate, and the esters of ethylenically unsaturated C3-C8 mono-or dicarboxylic acids with C1-C18-, preferably C1-C12- and, in particular, C1-C8-alkanols or C5-C8-cycloalkanols.

Also suitable are C4-C8 conjugated dienes, such as 1,3-butadiene, isoprene or chloroprene, a -olefins, such as ethylene, propene and isobutene, and vinyl chloride or vinylidene chloride. Amongst these, preference is given to the esters of acrylic acid with C2-C10 alkanols, in particular with C1-C8 alkanols, to vinylaromatic monomers, in particular styrene, and to esters of methacrylic acid with C1-C4 alkanols. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the monomers M comprise as monomers Ml at least one ester of acrylic acid with C2-C10 alkanols and at least one ester of methacrylic acid with C1-C4 alkanols. In this embodiment, vinylaromatics such as styrene may be present or preferably absent. In a very preferred embodiment of the invention, the monomers M1 are selected from a mixture consisting of at least one ester of acrylic add with a C2-C10 alkanol and at least one ester of methacrylic acid with a C1-C4 alkanol.

In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the monomers Ml are selected from a mixture consisting of at least one ester of acrylic acid with a C2-C10 alkanol, styrene and an ester of a methaycrylic acid with a C1-C4 alkanol.<br>
Suitable ionic monomers (monomers M2) include in particular monoethylenically unsatureated acids such as monoethylenically unsaturated C3-C6 monocarboxylic acids, e.g. acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinylacetic acid, monoethylenically unsaturated C4-C8 dicarboxylic acids such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, monoethylenically unsaturated sulfonic acids, e.g. vinylsulfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, 2-acryloxyethane sulfonic acid, 2-methacrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid, 2-methacryloxyethane sulfonic acid and the salts thereof, in particular the alkalimetal salts and the ammonium salts thereof. In general, the amount of ionic monomers will not exceed 5 % by weight, in particular 3 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M. More preferably, the amount of ionic monomers M2 ranges from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, more preferably from 0.2 to 2 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers M. In a very preferred embodiment, the polymeric binder comprises at least one ionic monomer M2 selected from itaconic acid, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and from mixtures of itaconic acid with acrylic acid or methacrylic acid.<br>
Suitable monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, which are neutral and which have a water solubility of at least 50 g/l (monomers M3) might be present in the polymeric binder in amounts up to 20 % by weight, preferably up to 10 % by weight and in particular up to 5 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M. Preferably<br><br>
the total amount of monomers M2 + M3 does not exceed 20 % by weight, in particular 10 % by weight, and more preferably 5 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M.<br>
Examples of monomers MS include monomers M3a which are selected from the amides of monoethylenically unsaturated C3-C6 monocarboxylic acids, for example, the amides of acrylic acid and of methacrylic acid, the C2-C4 hydroxyalkyi esters of monoethylenically unsaturated C3-C6 monocarboxylic acids, for example, the 2-hydroxyethyl esters, the 2-  or 3- hydroxypropyl esters, and the 2- or 4-hydroxybutyl esters of acrylic acid and of methacrylic acid, the esters of monoethylenically unsaturated C3-C6 carboxylic acids with polyalkylene glycols and their monoethers, especially the esters with polyethylene glycols and the esters with monoalkyl ethers of polyethylene glycols which are described e.g. in US- 5,610,225. Monomers M3a are usually present in amounts from 0 to 5 % by weight, in particular 0.1 to 4 %, by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 3 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers M.

Monomers M3 also include monomers M3c which are ethylenically unsaturated nitrites such as acrylonltrile and methacrylonitrile. Monomers M3c may be present in the polymer binder In amounts up to 20 % by weight, preferably up to 10 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M.<br>
The monomers M may further include polyolefinically monomers, i.e. monomers having two or more nonconjugated double bonds (monomers M4), such as ethylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4- butanediol diacrylate, allyl acrylate and ally! methacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate. Polyolefinically unsaturated monomers may be used, if desired, in amounts 
The monomers M may further include those monomers which in addition to an ethylenically unsaturated double bond have a reactive functional group (monomers M5), e.g., an aldehyde group, a keto group, a siloxane group or an oxirane group. Functional groups of this kind lead to crosslinking in the course of film formation or may<br><br>
be crosslinked with the aid of a crosslinker during film formation. Examples of monomers M5 are acrolein, methacrolein. diacetoneacrylamide and diacetonemethacrylamide, vinyl acetoacetate or the esters of acetoacetic acid with hydroxyalkyi acrylates and hydroxyalkyi methacrylates, examples being 2-acetoacetoxyethyl acrylate and 2- acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, and also glycidyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. Additional crosslinkers that are suitable include nonvolatile polyamine compounds having two or more reactive amino groups. Examples of these are oxalic dihydrazide, malonic dihydrazide, and adipic dihydrazide.<br>
Preferably monomers M do not comprise more than 0.5 % by weight of monomers other than monomers M1, M2 and M3.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the binder polymers comprise<br>
from 20 to 65 %, in particular from 30 to 54,9 % by weight based on total monomer M of at least one monomer M1a, selected from vinylaromatic monomers and C1-C4 alkyl esters of methacrylic acid in particular methyl methacrylate, with C1-C4 alkyl esters of methacrylic acid latter being preferred,<br>

In a very preferred embodiment, monomers Mia comprise 2-ethylhexyl acrylate or a mixture of 2-ethylhexylacrylate and a further C2-C10 alkyl ester of acrylic acid different therefrom such as n-butyl acrylate.<br>
With very particular preference, the binder polymers comprise:<br>
from 40 to 59,4 % by weight of at least one monmer M1a, which is in particular methyl methacrylate or a mixture thereof with styrene;<br>
from 40 to 55% by weight, of at least one monomers M1b, which is in particular selected from n- butyl acrylate and 2- ethylhexyl acrylate;<br>

the total amount of monomers M1a, Mlb, M2, M3a, M3b and M3c being 100 % by weight and the total amount of monomers M2, M3a and M3b being from 0.7 to 5 % by weight.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it has proven advantageous If the polymer particles of the binder polymer in the aqueous dispersion have a weight-average polymer particle diameter of less than 500 nm, preferably in the range from 50 to 300 nm, and with particular preference in the range from 80 to 200 nm (determined by means of an ultracentrifuge or by photon correlation spectroscopy; on particle size determination using an ultracentrifuge see. e.g., W. Machtle, Makromolekulare Chemie, 1984, vol. 185, 1025-1039; W. Machtle, Angew. Makromolekulare Chemie, 162, 1988, 35-42).<br>
The aqueous dispersions of the binder polymer are usually prepared by free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization of the aforementioned monomers M in the presence of at least one free-radical polymerization Initiator and of at least one surface-active substance.<br>
Suitable surface active substances for this purpose comprise emulsifiers and protective colloids. Preferably the polymer dispersions which are used as binders are prepared in the presence of at least one emulsifier. Appropriate emulsifiers which are commonly used for such purposes can be found e.g. in Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, volume XIV/1, Makromolekulare Stoffe [Macromolecular Substances], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1961, pp. 192-208, and In M. Schwartz, R. Baumstark. loc. cit.<br>
In general, the polymer dispersion that is used as a polymer binder is prepared in the presence of at least one anionic emulsifier. Suitable anionic emulsifiers include alkali metal salts and ammonium salts, especially the sodium salts, of alkyl sulfates (alkyl: C6-C20), of sulfuric acid monoesters with ethoxylated alkanols (EO units: 0 to 12, alkyl: C10-C20), and of alkylsulfonic acids (alkyl: C10-C20), mono-  and di- (C4-C16 alkyl)diphenyl ether disulfonates and mono- and dialkyl esters of phosphates (alkyl: C8 C20), and phosphoric acid monoesters and diesters with ethoxylated alkanols (EO units: 0 o12, alkyl:C10-C20).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the anionic emulsifier, which is used in the preparation of the polymer dispersion comprises at least one anionic emulsifier which is different from the anionic surfactants S. In particular, the anionic emulsifier is absent in the preparation of the aqueous polymer dispersion. However, a mixture of a surfactant S and at least one further anionic emulsifier different therefrom may be used in the<br><br>
preparation of the polymer dispersion. In these mixtures the weight ratio of surfactant S and the further anionic emulsifier is from 1:3 to 3:1.<br>
In another embodiment the surfactant S is the only anionic emulsifier, which is used for the preparation fo the aqueous polymer dispersion.<br>
The total amount of anionic emulsifier which is present in the preparation of the aqueous polymer dispersion is preferably from 0.1 to 5 %, in particular from 0.2 to 3 % by weight, based on the total amount of monomers M.<br>
A non-ionic emulsifier may also be present, when the aqueous polymer dispersion is prepared. Suitable nonionic emulsifiers comprise aliphatic nonionic emulsifiers, examples being ethoxylated long-chain alcohols (EO units: 3 to 50, alkyl: Ce-Cae) and polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide block copolymers. Preference is given to ethoxylates of long-chain alkanols (alkyl: C10-C22, average degree of ethoxylation: from 3 to 50) and, of these, particular preference to those based on naturally occurring alcohols or 0x0 alcohols having a linear or branched C12-C18 alkyl rddical and a degreee of ethoxylation of from 2 to 50. Particularly preferred nonionic emulsifiers are the ethoxylates of 0x0 alcohols having a branched C10-C16 alkyl radical and an average degree of ethoxylation in the range from 8 to 20, and also fatty alcohol ethoxylates having a linear C14-C18 alkyl radical and an average degree of ethoxylation in the range from 10 to 30. Nonionic emulsifiers are used normally in an amount of from 0.1 to 5% by weight, in particular from 0.3 to 3% by weight, and especially in the range from 0,5 to 2% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers M.<br>
Preferably, a non-ionic emulsifier is not present, when the aqueous polymer dispersion is prepared as this reduces the stain resistance for hydrophilic stains, however they may be used in the polymer dispersion or the final paint to improve tinting of the final paint.<br>
Preferably, the total amount of anionic and nonionic emulsifier will not exceed 5% by weight, in particular 4 % by weight, more preferably 3 % by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers M, and in particular is in the range from 0.5 to 4% by weight or 0.5 to 3 % by weight.<br>
Examples of suitable protective colloids are polyvinyl alcohols, starch derivatives and cellulose derivatives and vinylpyrroiidone copolymers. A detailed description of further suitable protective colloids can be found in  Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie, volume XIV/1, Makromolekulare Stoffe. Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1961,<br><br>
pp. 411-420. In the preparation of the binder polymers of the invention it is preferred to use no protective colloids.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition of the invention does not contain emulsifiers having an alkylphenyl radical such as alkylphenolsulfonates. sulfates or phosphates of alkoxylated alkylphenols or alkoxylated alkylphenols.<br>
The emulsifiers remain in the polymer dispersion when it is formulated as a coating composition and thus will affect their properties. It has been proven advantageous, when the total amount of emulsifiers in the coating composition is from 0.1 to 7 % by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, based on the total weight of the coating composition.<br>
Suitable free-radical polymerization initiators are all those capable of triggering a free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization. They may include both peroxides, such as alkali metal peroxodisulfates, and azo compounds. As polymerization initiators it is common to use what are known as redox initiators, which are composed of at least one organic reducing agent and at least one peroxide and/or hydroperoxide, an example being tert- butyl hydroperoxide with sulfur compounds, e.g., the sodium salt of hydroxymethanesulfinic acid, sodium sulfite, sodium disulfite, sodium thiosulfate, or acetone-bisulfite adduct, or hydrogen peroxide with ascorbic acid. Preferably, the amount of free radical initiator systems used, based on the total amount of the monomers for polymerization, is from 0.1 to 2% by weight.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymers S may be adjusted by adding small amounts, generally up to 2% by weight, based on the monomers to be polymerized, of one or more molecular weight regulator substances into the polymerization reaction. Examples of chain regulating agents include organic thio compounds, such as mercaptoethanol, mercapto acetic acid, mercapto propionic acid, alkylmercaptanes such as dodecylmercaptanes, furthermore silanes such as allyldimethylsilane, mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, allyl alcohols, and aldehydes. With regard to the staining properties of the coating compositions it has been proven advantageous when the polymer dispersion is prepared in the presence of such a chain regulating agent. Preferably the amount of chain regulating agent is from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, in particular from 0.05 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of monomers M. The chain regulating agent can be added to the initial charge of the polymerization reactor in the course of the polymerization reaction, e.g. together with the monomers or separately.<br><br>
The emulsion polymerization may take place either continuously or by the batch procedure, preferably by a semicontlnuous process. In semicontinuous processes the majority, i.e., at least 70%, preferably at least 90%, of the monomers for polymerization is supplied continuously, including staged or gradient procedures, to the polymerization batch. This procedure is also referred to as the monomer feed technique. The term monomer feed (stream) refers to liquid monomer mixtures, monomer solutions or, in particular, aqueous monomer emulsions. In a preferred embodiment the major part, i.e. at least 80 % of the monomers to be polymerized and optionally the chain regulating agent are added to the polymerization reaction in the course thereof.<br>
In addition to the seed-free mode of preparation, it is possible for the purpose of establishing a defined polymer particle size to conduct the emulsion polymerization by the seed latex process or in the presence of seed latex prepared in situ. Processes for this purpose are known and can be found in the prior art (see EP- B 40419, EP-A-614 922, EP-A-567 812 and literature cited therein, and also *  Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology'  , Vol. 5, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., New York 1966. p. 847). The polymerization is preferably carried out in the presence of from 0.01 to 3% by weight, and in particular from 0.02 to 1.5% by weight, of a seed latex (solids content of the seed latex, based on total monomer amount), preferably with seed latex introduced initially (initial-charge seed). The seed latex may also be generated in situ from the monomers for polymerization by initially introducing a small amount of the monomers for polymerization in the form of an aqueous emulsion together with a portion of the surface-active substance, heating this emulsion to polymerization temperature, and then adding a portion of the initiator.<br>
The pressure and temperature of polymerization are of minor importance. In general, It is carried out at temperatures between room temperature and 120°C, preferably at temperatures from 40 to 110°C, and with particular preference between 50 and 95°C .<br>
Following the polymerization reaction proper it may be necessary to free the aqueous polymer dispersions of the invention substantially from odorous substances, such as residual monomers and other volatile organic constituents. This can be done conventionally by physical means, by distillative removal (especially by steam distillation) or by stripping with an inert gas. The reduction in the amount of residual monomers may also be effected chemically by means of free-radical postpolymerization, in particular under the action of redox initiator systems, as set out, for example, in DE-A-44 35 422, DE-A 44 35 423 or DE- A 44 19 518.<br><br>
Before being used in the formulations of the invention, the aqueous dispersions of the binder polymers are preferably adjusted to a pH in the range from 6 to 10, preferably by addition of a nonvolatile base, e.g., alkali metal hydroxides or alkaline earth metal hydroxides, and volatile (for example ammonia) or nonvolatile amines. Nonvolatile amines are, for example, ethoxylated diamines or poiyamines, examples being the products sold under the commercial designation Jeffamine (Texaco Chemical Co.).<br>
The aqueous polymer dispersions of the binder polymer obtained by the route of free-radical aqueous emulsion polymerization generally have solids contents in the range from 40 to 70% by weight. They can be used directly, without further processing, as binder formulations. Alternatively, they may be compounded with the additives customary for the application in question to form a binder formulation. Furthermore, they may contain one or more biocides, e.g., 3- isothiazolones, for the purpose of preventing microbial infestation. In general, following their deodorization, the binder formulations of the invention contain less than 1000 ppm, preferably less than 500 ppm, of volatile organic compounds such as solvents or unpolymerized monomers.<br>
As mentioned above, the aqueous coating composition of the invention contains at least one pigment which may be a fine particulate organic or inorganic material. The term "fine particulate material" as used herein refers to any fine particulate non-film-forming organic or inorganic solids and includes any known pigments, extenders and fillers. Generally, the mean particle sizes of the fine particles range from about 0.01 to about 50 microns, in particular from 0.1 to 20 microns. Examples of suitable fine par¬ticulate inorganic material include TiO2 (in both anatase and rutile forms), clay (alumin¬ium silicate), CaCO3 (in both ground and precipitated forms), aluminium oxide, silicon dioxide, magnesium oxide, talc (magnesium silicate), barytas (barium sulfate), zinc oxide, zinc sulfite, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, iron oxide and mixtures thereof. Suitable mixtures include blends of metal oxides such as those sold under the marks MINEX® (oxides of silicon, aluminium, sodium and potassium commercially available from Unimin Specialty Minerals), CELITES® (aluminium oxide and silicon dioxide com¬mercially available from Celite Company), ATOMITES® (commercially available from English China Clay International), and ATTAGELS® (commercially available from Eng¬elhard). More preferably, the fine particulate material includes at least one of the groups of TiO2, CaCOa and clay. In a very preferred embodiment of the invention, the filler mainly consists of TiO2 or of a mixture of TiO2 with CaCO3 and/or clay. The temri " mainly consists of   is to be understood so that TiO2 or the mixture of TiO2 with CaCO3 and/or clay, respectively, makes up at least 80 % by weight, in particular at least 90 % by weight, of the filler material present in the coating composition. TiO2 par¬ticles used in the aqueous coating composition typically have a mean particle size of<br><br>
from" about 0.15 to about 0.40 microns. Organic pigment material includes opaque polymer particles, for example Ropaque® commercially available from Rohm and Hass and organic pigments with examples including but not limited to pthalocyanine green commercially available as Heliogen Green from BASF. The fine particulate pigment material can be added to the aqueous coating composition as a powder or in slurry form.<br>
The pigment material is preferably present in the aqueous coating composition in an amount of at least 2 % by weight, preferably at least 10 % by weight, in particular at least 20% by weight, the upper limit being about 60 % by weight or 50 % by weight, based on the total weight of the coating composition. The amount can be varied to ad¬just the gloss and opacity of the coating to the desired level. In general: the lower the level of fine particulate material, the higher the stain resistance of the coating.<br>
The weight ratio of pigment material to polymeric binder (calculated as solids) Is pref¬erably from 10:1 to 1:8 in particular from 4:1 to 1:5. The improvement of the staining properties is best for coating compositions having a pvc (pigment volume concentra¬tion) of at least 20%, in particular from 25% to 45%. However, improvement can also be achieved for higher pvc.<br>
The coating composition can optionally contain additives such as one or more film-forming aids or coalescing agents. Suitable film-forming aids or coalescing agents in¬clude plasticizers and drying retarders such as high boiling point polar solvents.<br>
The composition may also contain anti-freeze agents and or humectants / open time extenders based on the total weight of the aqueous coating composition. Exemplary anti-freeze agents include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol (1,2,3-trihydroxypropane), ethanol, methanol, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, and FTS-365 (a freeze-thaw stabilizer from Inovachem Specialty Chemicals). Anti freeze agents and open time extenders may also work as filmforming aids, although being very inefficient.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the total amount of film-forming aids and volatile organic compounds, i.e. compounds having a boiling point below 250°C at 1 atmosphere such as the aforementioned open time extenders and anti-freeze agents is below 6 % by weight. In particular below 3 % by weight.<br><br>
Despite the fact that the aqueous coating compositions of the invention include little or no volatile agents, the compositions possess good coating properties such as good washing stability and low blocking.<br>
Other conventional coating additives such as, for example, dispersants, additional sur¬factants (i.e. wetting agents), rheology modifiers, defoamers, thickeners, biocides, mil-dewcides, colorants such as coloured pigments and dyes, waxes, perfumes, co-solvents, and the like, can also be used in accordance with the invention. For example, non-ionic and/or ionic (e.g. anionic or cationic) surfactants can be used to produce the polymer latex. These additives are typically present in the aqueous coating composition in an amount from 0 to about 15% by weight, more preferably from about 1 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the coating composition. The additives dis¬cussed above can be added in any suitable order to the polymer dispersion, the pig¬ment, or combinations thereof, to provide these additives in the aqueous coating com¬position. In the case of paint formulations, the aqueous coating composition preferably has a pH of from 7 to 10. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the pH is 7 -  8.5.<br>
The balance of the aqueous coating composition of the invention is water. Although much of the water is present in the polymer latex dispersion and in other components of the aqueous coating composition, water is generally also added separately to the aqueous coating composition. Typically, the aqueous coating composition includes from about 10% to about 75% by weight and more preferably from about 30% to about 65% by weight water. Stated differently, the total solids content of the aqueous coating composition is typically from about 25% to about 90% by weight, more preferably, from about 35% to about 70%.<br>
The coating compositions are typically formulated such that the dried coatings com¬prise at least 10% by volume of dry polymer solids, and additionally 10 to 90% by vol¬ume of non-polymeric solids in the form of pigments, fillers or extenders. The dried coatings can also include additives such as plasticizers, dispersants, surfactants, rheology modifiers, defoamers, thickeners, biocides, mildewcides, colorants, waxes, and the like, that do not evaporate upon drying of the coating composition.<br>
The present invention further includes a method of preparing an aqueous coating com¬position by mixing together at least one polymer dispersion, at least one surfactant S as described above, and at least one pigment.<br>
The aqueous coating compositions of the invention are stable fluids that can be applied to a wide variety of materials such as, for example, paper, wood, concrete, metal.<br><br>
gyprock or plasterboard, cement sheet, glass, ceramics, plastics, plaster, and roofing substrates such as asphaltic coatings, roofing felts, foamed polyurethane insulation; or to previously painted, primed, undercoated, worn, or weathered substrates. The aque¬ous coating composition of the invention can be applied to the materials by a variety of techniques well known in the art such as, for example, brush, rollers, mops, air-assisted or airless spray, electrostatic spray, and the like.<br>
The present invention will now be further described by the following non-limiting exam¬ples.<br>
Examples<br>
General method for preparing polymer dispersions<br>
Polymer dispersions were produced in glass lined reactors. A pre emulsion of monomers and surfactants was prepared and the reactor charged with small part of the monomers to be polymerized, about 1.2 pphm of seed latex and and a small part of the surfactants used during polymerization. The reactor contents were heated to oveV 60 °C and the preemulsion of monomers and a solution of the initiator were fed into the reactor over a period of 3 hours. Temperature was maintained below 100 °C   for the duration of the polymerization reaction, the contents were then cooled to 70 °C and chemical deodorisation commenced. After further cooling to below 50 **C the pH was adjusted to 7.0 -  8.5 and a commercial biocide was added.<br>
Samples with post addition of surfactant S were prepared by addition of surfactant S under low speed mixing to the polymer dispersion. At the completion of addition of the surfactant S the polymer dispersion was stirred for a further 15 minutes before being filtered.<br>

III.     Application properties<br>
III.1   Stain resistance:<br>
For stain resistance, the modified BASF Australia Ltd method "BALTM048" was used. Test paints were drawn down onto black PVC scrub panels (from the Leneta company) at a wet film thickness (WFT) of 125µm. The samples were allowed to cure at 23°C for 24h. Then, another 125 µm WFT film was drawn down over the first, thereby obtaining a two coat test sample. After the second coat had been applied, the samples were allowed to cure again for 7 days at 23°C.<br><br>
Three standard liquid stains, i.e. Artline red stamp ink, Parker Quink blue pen ink and a 10% w/w solution of instant coffee, as well as miustard and red wine were tested.. Liquid stains were applied to the coating in a band approxintiately 1 to 2 cm wide in amounts of approximately 1 ml per stain. The crayon and lipstick were applied in bands about 1-2 cm wide. Each panel was stained in one area with each stain, although two separate stain panels were tested of each paint sample. The stains were then allowed to stand on the coating for 5 minutes, prior to being briefly rinsed to remove excess stain. The panels were then placed on a scrub tester. A sponge. Gates Clean type cut to fit a Sheen scrub tester block, was saturated with 50ml of a 1% m/m Teric® N9 solution. This was then used to wash the test panel 200 times. To ensure the sponge was moist throughout the washing test, a dropping funnel delivered 4 drops per minute of the Teric N9 solution to one end of the stain panel. After this cleaning, the panels are briefly rinsed again and allowed to dry for 24 hours at 23°C. The results are given in table 1 as DE-values The "DE" is the total colour difference between an unstained and washed section of the panel and the stained and washed area as measured by a DataColor Spectrophotometer. Three points are read per panel for each stain and the washed section. The result for each stain is the average of two panels.<br>

III.2   Wash resistance<br>
Wash resistance testing was carried out over single draw downs of the test paints, with a 1% Teric N9 solution and the same type of sponge as used previously. Test paints were drawn down onto black PVC scrub panels (Lineta Company, USA) at a wet film thickness (WFT) of 125 µm. The samples were allowed to cure at 23°C for 7 d. Then, gloss at 60° and 85° angle was detemiined using a BYK gloss meter, taking an average of 3 readings along the panel. Then, wash tests were carried out by placing the panels on a scrub tester. A sponge, the same type as that used in the stain test, previosuly soaked in 50ml of a 1% m/m Teric® N9 solution ( as used in the stain test) was then allowed to wash the test panel 200 times. Gloss was again determined at 60° and 85°, although only the 85° results are quoted here as they are the most significant. The results given in table 2 are the average of 3 gloss readings of the panels.<br>
Table 2: Gloss Values (85° readings)<br><br><br><br>
111.3   Stain penetration<br>
Stain penetration provides an indication if the stain is penetrating into the paint film or being repelled at the surface. Good stain penetration resistance is critical for high stain resistance. Test paints were drawn down onto glass panels at a wet film thickness (WFT) of 125µm. These panels were allowed to cure for 7 days at 23°C  before being tested. The panels were stained in a single location only, with red wine, red ink, blue ink and coffee, which were allowed to sit on the paint films for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the panels were rinsed briefly with water and allowed to dry for 24 hours. Observations were then made about how deep the stains had penetrated into the paint films by viewing the stains from the other side of the glass panels, with the stained side placed over a neutral white background. The following rating was applied:<br>
Rating	Description<br>
0	Stain not visible<br>
1	Stain very faintly visible<br>
2	Stain faintly visible<br>
3	Stain clearly visible<br>
4	Stain very strong but not penetrated to glass<br>
5	Stain penetrated to glass<br><br><br>
Results show that reducing the level of EO rather than the level of surfactant as well as increasing the alkyl chain length has given an improvement in stain resistance and stain penetration resistance, without affecting wash resistance.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
