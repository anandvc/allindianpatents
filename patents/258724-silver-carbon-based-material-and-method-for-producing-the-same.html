Silver/carbon-based material<br>
and method for producing the same<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a material based on silver-<br>
carbon and a material obtainable therefrom. The use of the material is likewise<br>
described.<br>
Materials for electrical contacts in power engineering consist generally of silver and<br>
particular metallic and/or nonmetallic or oxidic additives. Such materials are produced<br>
predominantly by a powder metallurgy route. In this method, the components are mixed<br>
with one another in powder form.<br>
The application profile of such contact materials is determined crucially by the<br>
switching device type, the magnitude of the switching current and the type of electrical<br>
load. The operating conditions require low electrical wear, i.e. high arc erosion<br>
resistance, and low welding force with simultaneously low contact resistance.<br>
Contact materials based on silver-carbon, especially silver-graphite, have found use<br>
particularly in the sector of circuit breakers in low-voltage power engineering. The<br>
crucial factor here is especially ultra-high reliability with respect to the welding of the<br>
contact pieces.<br>
Improvement in the processing and contact properties of these materials is the constant<br>
motivation for further material and technology developments. At the forefront is the<br>
optimization of the two switch properties of arc erosion resistance and welding<br>
resistance. These are actually opposing with regard to the carbon content. In other<br>
words, with increasing carbon content, protection against welding generally becomes<br>
better, but the arc erosion resistance decreases (E. Vinaricky "Elektrische Kontakte,<br>
Werkstoffe und Anwendungen" [Electrical contacts, materials and applications!;<br>
2nd edition, Springer Verlag; 2002; p. 251-255).<br>
The addition of carbon also brings about mechanical strengthening of the material, such<br>
that the producibility and processibility of the material becomes more difficult with<br>
rising carbon content. This effect occurs especially when a powder metallurgy mixture<br>
of the two components is to be compacted and reshaped by extrusion. At carbon<br>
contents of more than about 5%, the material can be extruded only with very great<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
2<br>
difficulty.<br>
EP-A-311 134 discloses a material produced by powder metallurgy for electrical<br>
contacts composed of silver with from 2 to 7% by weight of graphite and a specific<br>
additive which enhances the strength of the material.<br>
EP-A-736 885 describes a material for electrical contacts composed of silver-carbon,<br>
which has improved arc erosion properties. This material comprises carbon exclusively<br>
in the form of carbon black with a mean primary particle size of less than<br>
150 nanometers. The material is produced by cold isostatic pressing and sintering.<br>
WO 92/18995 relates to a particular composite material for electrical contacts. The<br>
composite material is based on silver and contains from 0.5 to 10% by weight of carbon,<br>
carbon powder being processed in combination with carbon fibers in a mass ratio of<br>
from 10:1 to 1:10 together with the silver component by powder metallurgy to give a<br>
material. On average, the length of the carbon fibers is more than double the diameter of<br>
the carbon powder particles.<br>
A further composite material for electrical contacts is disclosed in EP-A-729 162. It is<br>
produced using carbon fibers which have been subjected to a specific comminution<br>
process.<br>
In the above-described publications, the material was produced by powder metallurgy.<br>
In the Chinese patent CN-A-1396025, a chemical reduction process for producing<br>
silver-graphite material is presented. In this process, graphite nanopowder having a size<br>
of about 20 nm is used. The graphite powder is introduced into a reaction vessel and<br>
mixed with silver nitrate solution. Subsequently, hydrazine hydrate solution is added,<br>
such that a silver layer is deposited onto the graphite nanopowder. The graphite<br>
nanopowder coated with a silver layer is subsequently processed further by means of<br>
individual pressing and sintering. This process has the disadvantage that the hydrazine<br>
hydrate used is hazardous to health and is consequently undesirable for industrial scale<br>
application. The present inventors have additionally found that the material obtained by<br>
this process is not sufficiently finely dispersed and homogeneous. Furthermore, the<br>
material has excessively high strengthening, such that processing by extrusion is<br>
possible only under costly conditions, if at all. The processing by individual pressing<br>
proposed in CN-A-1396025 is usually comparatively undesirable on the industrial scale<br>
from an economic point of view.<br>
DE-A-100 17 282 describes a particular two-nozzle precipitation process for producing<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
3<br>
composite powder. The composite powders are, unlike the inventive materials, not<br>
materials based on silver-carbon but rather materials based on silver-tin oxide. Silver-tin<br>
oxide contact materials and, more generally, silver-oxide contact materials are used<br>
mainly for contactors which switch under air for low-voltage and high-voltage<br>
engineering. The main objective of their function is to ensure very many switching<br>
cycles, for example for an engine control system. The material and switching device are<br>
such that several tens of thousands (AC4 switching response) to millions of switching<br>
cycles (AC3 or AC1 switching response) are possible according to the switching<br>
conditions. Accordingly, these materials must have good arc erosion behavior and<br>
acceptable reliability with respect to welding.<br>
Materials based on silver-carbon, in contrast, are used very predominantly in circuit<br>
breakers (for example line circuit breakers, engine circuit breakers, power switches) in<br>
low-voltage power engineering. The switches serve here for the safety of people and<br>
equipment. In the case of failure, for example a short circuit, ultra-high requirements are<br>
made here on welding reliability, i.e. they must never become welded. Since the<br>
switches should be triggered only in the case of emergency, a significantly lower<br>
number of switching operations is accepted here. According to the switching condition,<br>
this may only be a few dozen, or a few hundred up to a maximum of a few thousand<br>
switching cycles. Frequently, asymmetric material pairs are used in order to take<br>
account of peculiarities in construction and economic aspects. These are material pairs<br>
such as AgC with Cu, AgW, Ag-metal oxide or AgNi. There is therefore no<br>
comparability with silver-tin oxide materials.<br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide materials based on silver-carbon,<br>
which have improved welding resistance, arc erosion resistance and/or processibility.<br>
Accordingly, the invention relates to a process for producing a material based on silver-<br>
carbon, comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) providing a suspension of carbon particles; and<br>
(ii) supplying a solution of a silver compound and of a reducing agent, such that a<br>
silver-containing precipitate is deposited onto the carbon particles,<br>
where the carbon particles have a mean diameter of 200 nm or greater.<br>
The invention further relates to a material obtainable by this process, and to the use of<br>
the material in circuit breakers for low-voltage power engineering.<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
4<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of an apparatus which can be used in a preferred<br>
embodiment of the process according to the invention.<br>
A reaction vessel (1) is initially charged with a suspension of carbon particles (2). These<br>
are mixed intensively by a stirrer (3). By means of two separate feed lines (4; 5), whose<br>
nozzles are below the liquid level of the suspension (2), one solution in each case of the<br>
silver compound (4') and reducing agent (5') are fed to it simultaneously, as a result of<br>
which silver-containing precipitate is deposited onto the suspended carbon particles.<br>
In the process according to the invention, a suspension of carbon particles is initially<br>
provided. The carbon particles are not particularly restricted. It is possible to use all<br>
carbon particles which are typically used in materials based on silver-carbon. They are<br>
preferably selected from graphite powder, carbon fibers and carbon black, and also<br>
combinations thereof, particular preference being given to graphite powder and carbon<br>
fibers. The carbon fibers preferably have a mean diameter of from 500 to 15 000 nm,<br>
more preferably from 2000 nm to 7000 nm.<br>
The carbon particles can, for example, be divided into spherical and fibrous carbon<br>
particles. Spherical carbon particles, for instance graphite powder and carbon black,<br>
generally have an essentially spherical shape. In this context, "spherical" means that the<br>
particles have essentially equal longitudinal dimensions in all three spatial directions.<br>
The mean diameter of the spherical carbon particles is 200 nm or greater. In contrast to<br>
these are fibrous carbon particles such as carbon fibers. Fibrous carbon particles are<br>
defined here as particles which, in one spatial direction, have a longer dimension than in<br>
the other two spatial directions. Typically, the fiber length, relative to the fiber diameter,<br>
has a ratio of at least 2:1, preferably at least 5:1. The maximum fiber length is, for<br>
example, 20:1 in relation to the fiber diameter. The mean diameter (fiber diameter) of<br>
the fibrous carbon particles is 200 nm or greater. Typical fibrous carbon particles have a<br>
diameter of from 0.5 to 30 µm, preferably from 1 to 20 µm, particularly preferably from<br>
3 to 10 µm and have corresponding fiber lengths in each case.<br>
In one embodiment, the carbon particles are a mixture of graphite powder and/or carbon<br>
blackxarbon fibers in a ratio of from 20:1 to 1:20. The mixture consists preferably of<br>
from 100% by weight to 98% by weight of graphite powder and from 0% by weight to<br>
2% by weight of carbon black (based on the total weight of graphite and carbon black)<br>
in combination with carbon fibers. This is advantageous when the arc erosion resistance<br>
and welding resistance are to be balanced with respect to one another for a specific<br>
switching device. In another embodiment, only graphite powder is used as carbon<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
5<br>
particles. This is of interest when an optimal welding reliability is to be achieved. In a<br>
third embodiment, only carbon fibers are used as carbon particles. This allows the arc<br>
erosion resistance to be enhanced.<br>
The carbon particles are suspended in a liquid. The type of liquid is not particularly<br>
restricted. However, it should react neither with the carbon particles, nor the silver<br>
compound, nor the reducing agent, nor the silver-containing precipitate. Examples of<br>
suitable liquids are water, suitable organic solvents (e.g. alcohols) and combinations<br>
thereof. In addition, it is possible to use wetting aids, for example surfactants, in order<br>
to facilitate the suspension of the carbon particles. Preference is given to using water.<br>
The concentration of the carbon particles in the suspension is likewise not particularly<br>
restricted. It is generally selected such that the suspension has a suitable viscosity and<br>
the subsequent reduction proceeds advantageously. Too high a liquid content should,<br>
however, be avoided, since the liquid has to be removed again. The optimal<br>
concentration can be selected in a suitable manner without any problem by the person<br>
skilled in the art. It is preferably in the range from 0.1 to 25% by weight of carbon<br>
particles in the suspension.<br>
In order to deposit a silver-containing precipitate onto the carbon particles, a solution of<br>
a silver compound and a reducing agent is added to the suspension of carbon particles.<br>
The solution of the silver compound can be added to the suspension of carbon particles<br>
before, after or simultaneously with the reducing agent. A preferred addition process is<br>
described in DE-A-100 17 282. The process described relates to the chemical reductive<br>
precipitation of silver-containing precipitate onto tin oxide particles. However, it can be<br>
used analogously for the chemical reductive precipitation of silver-containing<br>
precipitate onto carbon particles.<br>
The silver compound used is not particularly restricted and may, for example, be any<br>
soluble silver salt. Examples thereof are nitrates, acetates, carbonates, citrates and<br>
oxalates. Preference is given to using nitrates. The silver compound used is preferably<br>
dissolved in water or a suitable organic solvent (e.g. alcohol). In general, water is used<br>
as the solvent.<br>
The silver-containing precipitate is preferably metallic silver.<br>
Useful reducing agents are all compounds which can reduce the silver compound.<br>
Typical examples are ascorbic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, formic acid and<br>
hydroxylamine. The reducing agent may likewise be dissolved in water or a suitable<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
6<br>
organic solvent (e.g. alcohol) and be supplied in dissolved form.<br>
In order to achieve the uniform precipitation of silver-containing precipitate onto the<br>
carbon particles, the silver compound and the reducing agent are appropriately added<br>
continuously over the course of the reduction, simultaneously but with separate supply<br>
and in stoichiometrically equivalent amounts. Intensive mixing is likewise<br>
advantageous during the reduction. The supply is effected advantageously below the<br>
liquid surface.<br>
The proportions of silver compound and carbon particles are guided by the end use of<br>
the material and can be selected suitably by the person skilled in the art.<br>
Advantageously, the material contains from 0.5 to 12% by weight, preferably from 1 to<br>
12% by weight, more preferably from 2 to 10% by weight, even more preferably from 2<br>
to 8% by weight, of carbon. The material may contain further components or impurities<br>
in an amount of up to 1% by weight. The remaining fractions in the material are silver.<br>
The process according to the invention allows the preparation of materials based on<br>
silver-carbon. It is possible by the process according to the invention to achieve more<br>
homogeneous distribution of the carbon particles than in customary powder metallurgy<br>
mixing processes. This is particularly advantageous in the case of fibrous or very fine<br>
particles which are difficult to mix. In addition, a higher ductility is achieved, such that<br>
processibility is facilitated, for example in the extrusion and in the subsequent shaping.<br>
A further advantage is that higher fill levels can be achieved with the process according<br>
to the invention compared to processes which are based on mixing by powder<br>
metallurgy means. Consequently, a saving of the noble metal silver is possible.<br>
Moreover, a better switching response in circuit breakers is observed, compared to<br>
materials which are produced by means of mixing by powder metallurgy means.<br>
The carbon particles coated with the silver-containing precipitate can subsequently be<br>
separated from the solvent, optionally dried and then processed further. Although<br>
individual sintering is possible, it is not preferred for economic reasons. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the coated carbon particles, under cold isostatic conditions, are pressed,<br>
sintered and extruded. However, it is possible to employ any other known processes for<br>
further processing.<br>
Typical conditions for the cold isostatic pressing are from 60 to 90 MPa. The sintering<br>
is typically performed at from 800 to 900°C under protective gas such as N2/H2 (50:50).<br>
Subsequently, extrusion is performed. To this end, bolts are preheated, for example, to<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
7<br>
from 750 to 850°C before the pressing by means of induction heating, and then<br>
introducing directly into the preheated recipients (for example from 400 to 500°C) and<br>
pressed out in the defined form through the selected die.<br>
The materials produced by the process according to the invention are notable for a<br>
particularly homogeneous and dispersed distribution. In addition, they surprisingly have<br>
excellent welding resistance with equal or possibly better arc erosion resistance and<br>
good processing performance even at relatively high carbon contents.<br>
The resulting materials based on silver-carbon can be used in all fields of use in which<br>
materials based on silver-carbon have been used to date. However, they are particularly<br>
suitable for circuit breakers in low-voltage power engineering.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate the invention. However, they<br>
should not be regarded as a restriction. Instead, the scope of protection is determined by<br>
the claims.<br>
The following abbreviations are used:<br>
IS individual sintring<br>
WCP wet-chemical precipitation<br>
EX extrusion<br>
Example 1<br>
Material A is produced as a comparison by means of extrusion.<br>
19 kg of silver spray powder having a particle diameter of less than 63 µm were mixed<br>
in dry form with 1 kg of graphite powder (d50 4.4 µm). The mixture was subsequently<br>
pressed to bolts under cold isostatic conditions with a pressure of 60 MPa, sintered<br>
under H2/N2 (50:50) protective gas and, after inductive preheating of the bolt to 780°C,<br>
extruded. The switch samples were machined from the extruded wires such that the<br>
switch surface was at right angles to the direction of extrusion. The graphite particle<br>
agglomerates pulled apart in fibrous form by the extrusion were thus at right angles to<br>
the switch surface. In the case of agglomerates, the mean diameter is based essentially<br>
on the mean diameter of the particles of which the agglomerates are composed. To<br>
obtain a solderable and weldable layer, the particles were fired under air at 520°C for<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
8<br>
approx. 15min and then sawn through, such that an unfired switch surface was<br>
available.<br>
Example 2<br>
The inventive materials B, C, D, E and I were produced by chemical reductive<br>
precipitation and extrusion.<br>
Material B<br>
To produce a 1.5 kg batch of a composite powder with a 5% by weight carbon content,<br>
2244 g of silver nitrate, 75 g of graphite particles (d50 = 4.4 µm) and 1186.6 g of<br>
ascorbic acid were used. The graphite particles were suspended in distilled water with<br>
the aid of a disperser and then transferred to a reaction vessel. The silver nitrate was<br>
made up as a 3.5 molar solution and the ascorbic acid as a 1.7 molar solution. By means<br>
of simultaneous and equal addition of stoichiometric amounts through two separate<br>
feeds as shown schematically in figure 1, and with simultaneous intensive mixing by<br>
means of a high-energy stirring system, metallic silver was precipitated onto the<br>
graphite particles at a constant rate of approx. 130 g/min. The coated graphite particles<br>
thus produced were separated from the liquid by means of a suction filter, washed, dried<br>
and prescreened to 250 µm. The further processing was effected as in example 1 by<br>
means of extrusion.<br>
The sampling of the switch samples was again also effected such that the switch surface<br>
was at right angles to the direction of extrusion. Owing to the actually individually<br>
embedded particles, though, the structure here was so homogeneous that fibrous<br>
alignment of the graphite particles was virtually indiscernible.<br>
Materials C, D and E<br>
Materials C, D and E were produced like material B, with the difference that other<br>
carbon contents or carbon types were used. Material C contained 6% by weight of<br>
graphite particles, material D contained 4% by weight of graphite particles and 2% by<br>
weight of carbon fibers, and material E contained 7% by weight of graphite particles.<br>
Material I<br>
Material I was produced like material B, with the difference that the switch surface was<br>
aligned parallel to the direction of extrusion in the sampling of the switch samples.<br><br>
040056 TM<br>

Example 3<br>
Material F was produced by means of individual sintering as a comparison.<br>
2 kg of silver spray powder having a particle diameter of less than 63 µm were mixed in<br>
dry form with 100 g of graphite powder (d50 = 4.4 µm). The mixture was subsequently<br>
sintered individually. To this end, the powder mixture was filled into corresponding<br>
press molds, pressed (approx. 200 MPa) and sintered under a protective gas atmosphere<br>
(sintering temperature: 880°C; t = 3 h, atmosphere: 80/20 N2/H2; then calibration<br>
pressing at approx. 800 MPa). To obtain a solderable and weldable layer, a pure silver<br>
layer of approx. 10% of the total amount of sample was first introduced here into the<br>
press mold. Subsequently, the powder mixture was added.<br>
Example 4<br>
The inventive materials G and H were produced by chemical reductive precipitation and<br>
individual sintering.<br>
Material G<br>
To produce a 1.5 kg batch of a composite powder with a 5% by weight carbon content,<br>
2244 g of silver nitrate, 75 g of graphite particles (d50 = 4.4 µm) and 1186.6 g of<br>
ascorbic acid were used. The graphite particles were suspended in distilled water with<br>
the aid of a disperser and then transferred to a reaction vessel. The silver nitrate was<br>
made up as a 3.5 molar solution and the ascorbic acid as a 1.7 molar solution. By means<br>
of simultaneous and equal addition of stoichiometric amounts through two separate<br>
feeds as shown schematically in figure 1 and with simultaneous intensive mixing by<br>
means of a high-energy stirring system, metallic silver was deposited onto the graphite<br>
particles at a constant rate of approx. 130g/min. The coated graphite particles thus<br>
produced were separated from the liquid by means of a suction filter, washed, dried and<br>
prescreened to 250 µm. The further processing was effected as in example 3 by means<br>
of individual sintering technology.<br>
Material H<br>
Material H was produced like material G, with the difference that 6% by weight of<br>
graphite particles were used.<br><br>

Test methods<br>
Determination of the mean particle diameter<br>
The diameter of the spheres is defined as the particle diameter in the case of essentially<br>
spherical particles. In the case of nonspherical particles, the shortest diameter is defined<br>
as the particle diameter. For example, in the case of fibrous particles, the diameter of the<br>
fibers is defined as the particle diameter. To determine the mean particle diameter, the<br>
particle diameter of at least 25 particles is determined, for example, by means of<br>
microscopy. Subsequently, the mean is calculated.<br>
Switching response<br>
The switching response of the materials was studied both in a switch-on model switch<br>
and in a switch-off model switch.<br>
The switch-on model switch and switch-off model switch corresponded to the test<br>
apparatus described in "Uber den Einfluss des Herstellverfahrens auf das<br>
Schaltverhalten von Kontaktwerkstoffen der Energietechnik" [The influence of the<br>
production process on the switching response of contact materials in power<br>
transmission], Poniatowski, Schroder, Schulz; 7th Int. conference on electrical contacts.<br>
Paris 1974.<br>
Welding force<br>
To measure the welding force in the switching-on operation, the apparatus was<br>
equipped with a pressure measurement cell which enabled the force to be measured<br>
(referred to as the welding force) which has to be applied in the currentless separation of<br>
a weld.<br>
Specific arc erosion<br>
The specific arc erosion is determined in each case by weighing, by measuring the mass<br>
loss of the contact pieces after a particular number of switching operations and dividing<br>
it by the electric arc energy likewise determined.<br>
Specific switching conditions<br>

Table 1:	Welding force in the switch-on model switch, sample production by<br>
extrusion<br>
In the case of equal graphite contents, about a halving of the welding force compared to<br>
comparative material A1 and A2 is observed (compare samples A1 and A2 with<br>
samples B1 and B2). The process according to the invention additionally enables higher<br>
graphite contents than 5% also to be established, since the homogeneous embedding of<br>
the carbon particles into the silver matrix still allows sufficiently good processing<br>
properties to be realized. In the case of comparative material A1 and A2 in contrast,<br>
generally no graphite contents significantly higher than approx. 5% should be used,<br>
since the processing complexity which is then higher cannot be justified by<br>
correspondingly better switch properties.<br>
In contrast, the inventive materials can also be processed efficiently with graphite<br>
contents of 6 and 7% by weight. When the graphite content is increased, the welding<br>
force falls further once again, but the arc erosion surprisingly remains at about the same<br>
level, while the technical literature reports an increase in arc erosion with rising carbon<br>
content (see Vinaricky; see table 1). The process according to the invention also allows<br>
a portion of the graphite to be replaced by carbon fibers. The welding forces are<br>
lowered somewhat compared to the comparative material, without the arc erosion rising<br>
in the case of elevated carbon content (cf. table 1 &amp; table 3). It is therefore possible here<br>
too to establish higher carbon contents and hence to save silver. It is also of particular<br>
interest that an inventive material provides positive switching results when the switch<br>
surface is aligned parallel to the direction of extrusion. In the technical literature<br>
(Vinaricky, page 252), in the case of such an alignment, about a doubling in arc erosion<br>
is observed compared to alignment at right angles. Such a material has the great<br>
advantage that switch pieces can be produced with significantly higher yield from the<br>
extrudate owing to the different alignment than when the switch pieces have to be<br>
produced with alignment at right angles to the direction of extrusion. This is<br>
economically advantageous.<br><br>

Table 2: Welding force in the switch-on model switch, sample production by means<br>
of individual sintering<br>
In the case of individually sintered materials, the welding forces are generally very low,<br>
such that no significant differences are noticeable here. The advantages of the process<br>
according to the invention lie here in the comparatively better arc erosion behavior (see<br>
table 4).<br>
Example 6<br>
In this example, the arc erosion behavior of the materials produced by extrusion or<br>
individual sintering was tested in the switch-on model switch.<br><br>
Table 3: Specific arc erosion in the switch-on model switch; sample production via<br>
extrusion<br><br>
040056 TM<br>
14<br>
The arc erosion resistance is no better than for the comparative material at the same<br>
carbon content, but this arc erosion resistance is maintained even at higher carbon<br>
contents, while it has been reported in the prior art that it otherwise generally decreases<br>
with rising carbon content (see Vinaricky). In other words, it is possible to utilize the<br>
better welding resistance of the materials with higher carbon contents without the arc<br>
erosion behavior becoming significantly poorer as a result. There is an additional<br>
economic advantage through saving of silver. As a further positive aspect, the still good<br>
processibility should be mentioned, even in the case of material I with parallel<br>
alignment.<br><br>
Table 4: Specific arc erosion in the switch-on model switch; sample production via<br>
individual sintering<br>
The individually sintered material exhibits generally poorer arc erosion behavior than<br>
the extruded material. However, the values in table 4 show that the worsening in this<br>
property in the inventive materials does not assume such serious proportions as in the<br>
comparative material.<br>
Example 7<br>
In this example, the arc erosion behavior in the switch-on model switch is tested.<br><br><br>
040056 TM<br>
15<br><br>
Table 5: Specific arc erosion in the switch-off model switch; sample production via<br>
extrusion<br>
In the switch-off model switch, a comparable picture is found to that in the case of the<br>
switch-on model switch. Here too, the arc erosion resistance is maintained up to higher<br>
carbon contents or even improves somewhat (see table 5).<br><br>
Table 6: Specific arc erosion in the switch-off model switch; sample production via<br>
individual sintering<br>
The results of the individually sintered samples in the switch-off tests correspond again<br>
to the trends in the switch-on tests. The inventive material is better than the comparative<br>
material. This advantage is maintained even at 6% by weight of carbon.<br><br>
