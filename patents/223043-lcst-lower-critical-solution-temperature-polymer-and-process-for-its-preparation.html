				<td>LCST (LOWER CRITICAL SOLUTION TEMPERATURE) POLYMER AND<br>
PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to LCST (lower critical solution<br>
temperature) polymers. This term is used to refer to<br>
polymers which are soluble in a liquid medium at a low<br>
temperature but which above a certain temperature (the LCST<br>
temperature) precipitate from the liquid medium. LCST<br>
polymers have different chemical compositions. The best-<br>
known LCST polymers are polyalkylene oxide polymers,<br>
examples being polyethelyne oxide (PPO) polymers, but also<br>
(PEO)-(PPO) copolymers, especially PEO-PPO-PEO block<br>
copolymers. Other LCST polymers are poly(N-isopropyl-<br>
acrylamide)-ethyl-(hydroxyethyl)-cellulose derivatives,<br>
poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) derivatives and poly(methyl vinyl<br>
ether) derivatives.<br>
The firt-mentioned polymers are described for example in WO<br>
01/60926 Al. That publication relates to a process for<br>
coating substrate surfaces (particle surfaces and<br>
nonparticulate substrate surfaces) with LCST polymers, for<br>
which an LCST polymer is dissolved in a solvent at a<br>
temperature below the LCST temperature, this solution is<br>
mixed with the substrate surface to be coated, and the<br>
resulting mixture is heated to above the LCST temperature<br>
until the deposition of LCST polymers on the substrate<br>
surfaces<br>
begins. The deposited LCST polymer can be immobilized<br>
by providing it with functional groups which allow<br>
substantially irreversible adsorption on the substrate<br>
surface. The functional groups can be selected from<br>
acid groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, phosphate<br>
groups, mercaptan groups, siloxane groups or<br>
hydrophobic groups. Further, the LCST polymers can be<br>
provided with functional groups which, following<br>
deposition of the LCST polymers on the particles, allow<br>
the crosslinking of the LCST polymers in a crosslinking<br>
reaction. Functional groups of this kind can be<br>
selected from carboxylic acid group derivatives,<br>
chloroformate groups, amino groups, isocyanate groups,<br>
oxirane groups and/or free-radically crosslinkable<br>
groups, the crosslinking reaction being initiated,<br>
inter alia, by a change in the pH of the solution.<br>
Free-radical crosslinking is less preferred than<br>
crosslinking as a result of the change in pH. The<br>
examples indicate merely the enveloping of various<br>
pigment particles (TiO2, Fe2O3, Cu phthalocyanine blue<br>
and also semiconductor wafers having a silicon dioxide<br>
surface) with PEO-PPO-PEO block copolymers. Fixing of<br>
the copolymers deposited on the substrate surfaces is<br>
not illustrated.<br>
The use of LCST polymers for enveloping superpara-<br>
magnetic particles is known, further, from WO 97/45202.<br>
These particles comprise a core of a first polymer, an<br>
inner layer of a second polymer, which coats the core<br>
and in which a magnetic material is dispersed, and an<br>
outer layer of a third polymer, which coats the<br>
magnetic layer and is capable of reacting with at least<br>
one biological molecule, the second polymer at least<br>
being heat-sensitive and having an LCST temperature of<br>
15 to 65Â°C. The second polymer is preferably obtained<br>
by polymerizing (1) a water-soluble acrylamide monomer,<br>
such as N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM), (2) at least one<br>
crosslinking agent, such as N,N-methylenebisacrylamide,<br>
and (3) at least one functional cationic and water-<br>
soluble monomer which is different from the monomer<br>
(1) , an example being the chloride of 2-aminoethyl<br>
methacrylate. A further preferred polymer is [poly-(N-<br>
isopropylacrylamide)] (PNIPAM).<br>
"Patent Abstracts of Japan", Vol. 009 No. 188 (C295)<br>
(1985) page 107 = JP 60 058 237 A describes the<br>
encapsulation of inorganic particles. The aim is to<br>
prepare a stable particle dispersion. The inorganic<br>
particles are suspended in water and contacted below<br>
the LCST temperature with an aqueous solution of the<br>
LCST polymer. If the temperature of the resulting<br>
system is raised, a layer of the LCST polymer is<br>
deposited on the inorganic particles. The resulting<br>
particle suspension is admixed with a free-radically<br>
polymerizable monomer, an initiator and, if desired, an<br>
emulsifier, and an emulsion polymerization is carried<br>
out, giving encapsulated particles. Additionally, then,<br>
there is the polymerized monomer layer as an outer<br>
layer, so that the function of the LCST polymer layer<br>
is only to facilitate the penetration of monomer<br>
radicals.<br>
The polymerizable monomer is therefore reacted with the<br>
LCST polymer that is already on the particles, or the<br>
water-soluble polymer is enveloped with a layer of the<br>
polymer obtained from the polymerizable monomer. This<br>
process has the disadvantage that the graft attachment<br>
takes place only on the active centers of the pre-<br>
deposited LCST polymer, as a result of which the<br>
envelopment is nonuniform and heterogeneous and does<br>
not constitute a complete barrier.<br>
Furthermore, it is necessary to add a monomer to the<br>
dispersion of the coated particles in order to initiate<br>
crosslinking. In the majority of cases the monomer is<br>
never completely consumed, so that a certain portion of<br>
the monomer remains in the crosslinked structure.<br>
Subsequent emission of the "dissolved" monomers from<br>
the polymer is undesirable, since the monomer is<br>
injurious to health.<br>
Moreover, disadvantages in the paint system are to be<br>
expected as a result of the detachment of the<br>
copolymerized emulsifier if the pigment comes into<br>
contact with solvents.<br>
WO 92/20441 describes a process for producing<br>
encapsulated particles, the particles comprising a core<br>
surrounded by a coacervate coating. In this process an<br>
aqueous solution of an LCST polymer is contacted at a<br>
temperature of reversible insolubilization (TRI) of Tl,<br>
with a dispersion of the particles at a temperature of<br>
T2, which is lower than Tl, and then the dispersion is<br>
heated to a temperature above Tl, thereby depositing<br>
the LCST polymer as a coacervate around the particles.<br>
An agent for lowering the TRI is then added to the<br>
solution, the TRI of the LCST polymer in the solution<br>
being lowered to a temperature T3, which is lower than<br>
Tl, and subsequently either the dispersion is cooled to<br>
a temperature between T3 and Tl, and maintained at that<br>
temperature, or the particles are separated from the<br>
dispersion at a temperature of more than T3. As agents<br>
for lowering the TRI it is possible to use electrolytes<br>
and water-miscible organic liquids in which the LCST<br>
polymer is not soluble.<br>
LCST polymers used are preferably synthetic polymers<br>
(homopolymers or copolymers) with hydrophilic monomers.<br>
Suitable LCST monomers are acrylic or vinyl compounds.<br>
Where LCST copolymers are used, the comonomer is<br>
commonly hydrophilic and may be nonionic or ionic.<br>
Suitable nonionic monomers are certain acrylic or vinyl<br>
compounds. Anionic or cationic monomers are, for<br>
example, acrylic acid derivatives or dialkylaminoalkyl<br>
acrylates. These compounds, however, are already<br>
saturated at the ends, so that crosslinking reactions<br>
are no longer possible.<br>
LCST polymers are also known, for example, from EP 0<br>
629 649 Al. They are used as rheofluidifying additives<br>
and antisettling agents in diaphragm wall construction,<br>
for wells in the oil industry, and as hydraulic fluids<br>
and lubricants.<br>
EP 0 718 327 A2 discloses universally compatible<br>
pigment dispersahts which are composed of methyl<br>
methacrylate and an acrylate or methacrylate. These<br>
polymers, however, serve only for dispersing pigments,<br>
but not for enveloping pigments.<br>
DE 198 02 233 Al describes gels having thermotropic<br>
properties that are used, for example, for glazing<br>
systems, in order to achieve darkening as a function of<br>
insolation. The gels comprise an LCST polymer which is<br>
composed of 60%-99.9% by weight of ethylenically<br>
unsaturated lactams or vinyl ethers (monomer A) , 0-20%<br>
by weight of ethylenically unsaturated compounds having<br>
a crosslinking action (monomer B) , 0.1%-30% by weight<br>
of monomers containing at least one acid or acid<br>
anhydride group (monomer C) and 0-20% by weight of<br>
further monomers D. Preferably the LCST polymer<br>
comprises only monomers A and C, so that the LCST<br>
polymer is not crosslinked on irradiation. For<br>
preparing the gel a solution is prepared from the LCST<br>
polymer and from a free-radically polymerizable monomer<br>
(b) and the solution is irradiated with high-energy<br>
light. In the course of this irradiation the monomer<br>
(b) forms a three-dimensional network, i.e., a gel,<br>
which is insoluble or virtually insoluble in the chosen<br>
solvent or solvent mixture. The network formed from the<br>
monomer (b) incorporates the LCST polymer, so giving a<br>
thermotropic gel which is crosslinked in a very wide-<br>
meshed fashion. The gel must be capable of being<br>
applied between the glass plates and must fill the<br>
A similar polymer system is described in DE 197 19 224<br>
Al. It describes a layer structure in which a<br>
thermotropic polymer system is disposed between an<br>
inner transparent glass sheet and an outer transparent<br>
glass sheet, which in other words is exposed to natural<br>
sunlight. The thermotropic polymer system is protected<br>
in the long term against UV light exposure by means of<br>
a UV protection layer. There again the thermotropic<br>
polymer system is composed of a gel with wide-mesh<br>
crosslinking.<br>
DE 197 00 064 Al describes gels with thermotropic<br>
properties, obtained by irradiating a mixture<br>
comprising an uncrosslinked polymer, free-radically<br>
polymerizable monomers, water or an organic solvent or<br>
mixtures thereof, and at least one specific photo-<br>
initiator. There again an LCST polymer is incorporated<br>
into a wide-mesh gel structure which is prepared from<br>
the free-radically polymerizable monomers. The gel is<br>
intended for use as a thermotropic layer in glazing<br>
systems.<br>
DE 196 01 085 Al describes gels with thermotropic<br>
properties which are likewise intended for use for<br>
glazing systems. The gels are obtained by irradiating a<br>
mixture comprising (a) an uncrosslinked polymer in<br>
amounts below 5% by weight, based on the sum of (a) ,<br>
(b) and (c) , (b) free-radically polymerizable monomers,<br>
and (c) water or an organic solvent or mixtures<br>
thereof. There again the LCST polymer is incorporated<br>
in a wide-meshed network formed from the free-radically<br>
polymerizable monomer.<br>
DE 196 01 084 Al describes gels for thermotropic layers<br>
which are obtained by irradiating a mixture with high-<br>
energy light. The mixture comprises an uncrosslinked<br>
polymer having a number-average molecular weight Mn of<br>
1000 to 30 000 g/mol (LCST polymer), free-radically<br>
polymerizable monomers and water or an organic solvent<br>
or mixtures thereof. These gels are likewise intended<br>
for use in glazing systems as a thermotropic layer.<br>
There again a gel is formed with the LCST polymer<br>
incorporated in its wide-meshed structure.<br>
In the case of the thermotropic gels described above<br>
for glazing systems, the LCST polymer is intended to<br>
retain its thermotropic properties even in the gel, so<br>
that it can be precipitated and dissolved repeatedly,<br>
so as to allow as high as possible a number of<br>
shading/lightening cycles. A gel of this kind is not<br>
suitable for the formation of coatings.<br>
One further such system is described in DE 44 14 088<br>
Al. These gels as well include an LCST polymer which is<br>
incorporated in a gel which is produced by polymerizing<br>
free-radically polymerizable monomers in a suitable<br>
solvent, such as water or an organic solvent.<br>
The object on which the invention was based was to<br>
provide LCST polymers which on cooling no longer detach<br>
from a substrate surface but instead remain firmly<br>
joined._..to it. The polymers should therefore be used<br>
without additions of emulsifiers or monomers, so that<br>
10 additives can be leached from the defined polymer<br>
layer.<br>
This object is achieved in accordance with the<br>
invention by means of LCST polymers which are<br>
obtainable by free-radical polymerization of<br>
A) about 45.0 to 99.9 mol% of at least one monomer<br>
or macromonomer featuring the structural unit<br>
a) N,N-dialkylacrylamide<br>
in which n is 1 to 10 000 and R1 (identical or<br>
different at each occurrence) is hydrogen or<br>
alkyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and<br>
the radicals Ri can also form a ring together<br>
with the nitrogen atom;<br>
in which s is 1 to 10 000 and R2 is an<br>
(iso)alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or<br>
a cyclopentyl group;<br>
B) about 0.1 to 55.0 mol% of a comonomer/selected from the<br>
group of<br>
a) maleic acid, maleic anhydride or an alkyl<br>
ester of maleic acid in which the alkyl<br>
group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms;<br>
b) fumaric acid or an alkyl ester of fumaric<br>
acid in which the alkyl group contains 1 to<br>
5 carbon atoms;<br>
c) acrylic or methacrylic acid or an alkyl<br>
acrylate or methacrylate in which the alkyl<br>
group contains 1 to 5 carbon atoms;<br>
d) a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate in<br>
which the alkyl group contains 1 to 5 carbon<br>
atoms;<br>
e) vinyl acetate;<br>
f) glycidyl (meth)acrylate;<br>
g) allyl glycidyl ether; and/or<br>
h) a,a-dimethyl-meta-isopropenylbenzyl<br>
isocyanate; and<br>
i) butadiene<br>
the polymer obtained by copolymerizing the<br>
monomers or macromonomers (A) and (B) being<br>
derivatized by means of a derivatizing agent<br>
containing at least one group which is able to<br>
react with a group of a repeating unit originating<br>
from the comonomer (B) , to form a covalent bond,<br>
and also at least one polymerizable double bond.<br>
By "macromonomers" are meant copolymers which are still<br>
capable of further polymerization, which is not always<br>
the case for certain copolymers. These macromonomers<br>
therefore still comprise, for example, a reactive<br>
polymerizable double bond.<br>
In the preparation of the LCST polymers of the<br>
invention first of all, from the monomers or<br>
macromonomers (A) and (B) , a polymer is prepared which<br>
generally already has LCST properties. This reaction is<br>
generally carried out in solution. Depending on the<br>
solubility of the polymer it is possible for instances<br>
of turbidity to arise during the reaction. These<br>
turbidities do not, however, substantially affect the<br>
structure or properties of the polymer. To prepare this<br>
polymer a suitable solvent is selected in which both<br>
the monomers or macromonomers (A) and (B) and the<br>
polymer are soluble, so that the reaction proceeds<br>
largely homogeneously. Suitable examples include water<br>
or alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol,<br>
or else mixtures of these solvents. Aliphatic or<br>
aromatic solvents can also be used. Aromatic solvents<br>
are preferred on account of their better solvency-<br>
properties. Examples of suitable aromatic solvents are<br>
toluene or the xylenes. The use of aliphatic or<br>
aromatic solvents is especially preferred when the<br>
polymer comprises reactive groups for the derivatiza-<br>
tion that are able to react with water or alcohols.<br>
Solvent mixtures can also be used here. As well as the<br>
solvents specified, other solvents too can be used.<br>
The polymer prepared in the first stage may comprise<br>
only one monomer from each of the groups (A) and (B)<br>
indicated above. It is also possible, however, for two<br>
or more monomers from the above-indicated groups (A)<br>
and (B) to be included in the polymer. Accordingly the<br>
polymer is obtained by copolymerization or terpolymeri-<br>
zation. Polymerizations with more than three different<br>
monomers can be carried out where appropriate.<br>
The monomers included in group (A) have a different<br>
polarity, so that through the ratio of the individual<br>
monomers (or macromonomers) it is possible to influence<br>
the LCST temperature of the LCST polymer. For instance,<br>
the monomer ((A, d); N-vinylpyrrolidone) has relatively<br>
polar properties and leads to an increase in the LCST<br>
temperature, whereas the monomer ((A, b); N-vinylcapro-<br>
lactam) has much more nonpolar properties, and so leads<br>
to lower LCST temperatures of the LCST polymer.<br>
Preference is given to using the monomer ( (A, d) ; N-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone) together with another monomer of<br>
group (A), very preferably in combination with one or<br>
both of the monomers ( (A, b) ; N-vinylcaprolactam) and<br>
((A, c); N-vinylpiperidone) and very preferably in<br>
combination with the monomer ( (A, b) ; N-vinylcapro-<br>
lactam) . The chosen fraction of the monomer ( (A, d) ;<br>
N-vinylpyrrolidone) as a proportion of the monomers of<br>
group (A) is preferably less than 70 mol%, in<br>
particular less than 60 mol%, and with more particular<br>
preference less than 50 mol%.<br>
The monomers of group (B) introduce groups which allow<br>
subsequent derivatization of the polymer. Besides a<br>
polymerization double bond, therefore, the monomers of<br>
group (B) include at least one reactive group which on<br>
the one hand does not disrupt the polymerization<br>
reaction and on the other hand remains within the<br>
polymer in order to allow reaction with a derivatizing<br>
agent. Through the polarity of the monomers of group<br>
(B) it is possible, further, to influence the LCST of<br>
the LCST polymer.<br>
The polymerization of the monomers of groups (A) and<br>
(B) is followed by derivatization of the polymer,<br>
through which pendent polymerizable double bonds are<br>
introduced into the polymer. The compounds with which<br>
the polymer is derivatized have on the one hand a<br>
polymerizable double bond and on the other hand a<br>
reactive group which allows their attachment to the<br>
backbone of the polymer. This attachment is via the<br>
reactive group introduced by the monomers B. The<br>
compounds preferably have a molecular weight in the<br>
range from 50 to 300. The introduction of these<br>
compounds does not substantially affect the LCST<br>
properties of the LCST polymer. The reactive group of<br>
the derivatizing agent is selected in accordance with<br>
the group introduced into the polymer by the monomer of<br>
group (B) . If a carboxyl group, a carboxylic ester<br>
group, a carboxylic anhydride group, an epoxy group or<br>
an isocyanate group has been provided on the polymer,<br>
then the derivatizing agent preferably comprises a<br>
hydroxyl group or an amino group. For the derivatiza-<br>
tion, therefore, unsaturated alcohols or amines are<br>
used with preference. If the reactive group introduced<br>
into the polymer by the monomer of group (B) was a<br>
hydroxyl group, the derivatizing agent comprises,<br>
accordingly, a carboxyl group, a carboxylic ester<br>
group, a carboxylic anhydride group or another<br>
activated carboxylic acid group, or else an epoxy group<br>
or an isocyanate group.<br>
Following the derivatization, the LCST polymer<br>
possesses pendent groups with polymerizable double<br>
bonds. The advantage of the LCST polymers of the<br>
invention therefore lies in the fact that, following<br>
deposition on a surface, they can still be crosslinked<br>
further, in which case a very high degree of<br>
crosslinking can be achieved.<br>
In one embodiment of the LCST polymer of the invention<br>
at least a proportion of the monomers of group (B) is<br>
replaced by butadiene. This has the advantage that the<br>
pendent polymerizable double bonds need not be<br>
introduced in a separate derivatization step but,<br>
instead, these pendent polymerizable double bonds are<br>
introduced as early as during the polymerization of the<br>
monomers or macromonomers of groups (A) and (B).<br>
The structural unit formed from the comonomers (B) (a)<br>
to (c) can be derivatized by transesterification with<br>
allyl alcohol, hydroxymethyl acrylate, hydroxymethyl<br>
methacrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate or 3-amino-l-propanol vinyl ether.<br>
The structural units formed from the comonomer (B) (d)<br>
can be derivatized by esterification with acrylic acid<br>
or with methacrylic acid or by transesterification with<br>
C1-C10 alkyl acrylates or methacrylates.<br>
The structural unit formed from the comonomer (B) (e)<br>
can be derivatized by transesterification with acrylic<br>
acid, methacrylic acid or C1-C10 alkyl acrylates or<br>
methacrylates.<br>
The structural unit formed from the comonomer (B) (g)<br>
and/or (h) or its OH-functional or NH-functional<br>
derivatives can be derivatized by reaction with<br>
(meth)acrylic acid.<br>
The structural units formed from the comonomer (B) (a)<br>
to (c) and comprising a carboxylic acid group can be<br>
derivatized by reaction with glycidyl (meth)acrylate<br>
and/or allyl glycidyl ether.<br>
The structural units formed from the comonomer (B) with<br>
OH and/or NH functionalities can be derivatized with<br>
a,a-dimethyl-meta-isopropenylbenzyl isocyanate. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention, for example, the<br>
structural unit formed from the comonomer (B) (d) is<br>
derivatized by reaction with a,a-dimethyl-meta-<br>
isopropenylbenzyl isocyanate.<br>
For the LCST polymers it is not possible to give<br>
precise formulae, since the monomers are generally<br>
arranged in a random distribution in the polymer chain.<br>
The polymer chain may also, however, be composed of<br>
blocks of the same monomers.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that, following the<br>
polymerization and derivatization of the comonomers (B)<br>
(a) to (B) (i), the polymers of the invention are<br>
immobilized irreversibly on the substrate surface. The<br>
immobilization is far greater than that of LCST<br>
polymers in which the end groups are composed, for<br>
example, of simple vinyl groups or other groups with<br>
double bonds. Substantially more than two polymerizable<br>
groups in the molecule are available for immobilizing<br>
the polymers. As a result of the presence of numerous<br>
double bonds, the crosslinking density becomes greater<br>
than in the case of only two (terminal) groups. A<br>
further point is that, owing to the tighter<br>
crosslinking (high crosslinking density), the swelling<br>
of the polymer immobilized on the pigment in (aqueous)<br>
solvents is substantially lower. This is a great<br>
advantage when the coated pigments are incorporated<br>
into paints, since paint defects, such as blistering<br>
and swelling, occur to a lesser extent.<br>
The polymers of the invention commonly have an LCST in<br>
the range from 7 to 70Â°C, which is dependent on factors<br>
including the following:<br>
molar ratio of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic<br>
fractions of the LCST polymer,<br>
molar mass of the LCST polymer,<br>
number of polymerizable and ionizable groups,<br>
concentration of the polymer,<br>
pH and ionic strength of the medium.<br>
The LCST polymers are composed of polar and nonpolar or<br>
hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments. The LCST can be<br>
tailored by varying these individual segments and also<br>
the overall chain length.<br>
Following the polymerization and derivatization, the<br>
LCST polymers of the invention can be used as<br>
dispersants fixed on the substrate surfaces. In this<br>
way, the expensive step of the pigment dispersion,<br>
among others, becomes cheaper, since the pigment<br>
carries its dispersant with it. Further, the pigments<br>
thus coated form agglomerates to a lesser extent than<br>
do untreated pigments, and so dispersion is easier to<br>
carry out, resulting in an additional reduction in<br>
costs.<br>
Dispersants are surface-active substances which<br>
facilitate the dispersion of a pulverulent substance,<br>
such as a pigment or filler, for example, in a liquid<br>
dispersion medium by lowering the surface tension<br>
between the two components. As a result, in the course<br>
of pigment dispersion, they facilitate the mechanical<br>
disruption of the secondary particles, which are<br>
present in the form of agglomerates, into primary<br>
particles. Furthermore, they protect the primary<br>
particles formed from reagglomeration or flocculation,<br>
by virtue of complete wetting and formation of a<br>
protective colloid shell or an electrochemical double<br>
layer.<br>
Since the LCST polymers of the invention are<br>
transparent or translucent in visible light, they are<br>
able to form a complete envelope around particles<br>
without affecting the color of the particles<br>
themselves. Moreover, in paints, pigments thus coated<br>
display the full color strength, since by virtue of the<br>
LCST polymer coating they do not form agglomerates.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention can be prepared by<br>
free-radical polymerization and subsequent derivatiza-<br>
tion. In this case about 45.0 to 99.9 mol%, preferably<br>
about 75 to 99 mol%, of at least one monomer or<br>
oligomer from group (A), together with about 0.1 to<br>
55.0 mol%, preferably about 1 to 25 mol%, of the<br>
comonomer (B) are used. The polymerization is carried<br>
out preferably in solution.<br>
It is also possible in this context to use mixtures of<br>
the monomers (A) and comonomers (B) . The copolymers of<br>
the invention can be prepared by free-radical<br>
polymerization in aqueous or alcoholic solution.<br>
Preference is given here to low molecular mass alcohols<br>
(C1 to C5), since they can be stripped off easily. Where<br>
the comonomers of group (B) include reactive groups<br>
which are able to react with alcohols or water, such as<br>
an epoxy group or an isocyanate group, for example, the<br>
solvents used may also include aliphatic or aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, with aromatic hydrocarbons being<br>
preferred. Examples of suitable aromatic solvents are<br>
toluene or xylene. The polymerization takes place in<br>
the presence of compounds which form free radicals, the<br>
polymerization initiators, such as organic peroxide or<br>
azo compounds or inorganic peroxide compounds. The<br>
molar mass of the resultant copolymer is influenced by<br>
adding suitable polymerization regulators, such as<br>
mercaptan, organic halogen compounds or aldehydes. The<br>
polymerization is generally conducted at temperatures<br>
of 50 to 100Â°C, preferably at temperatures of 60 to<br>
80Â°C.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention can be used to coat<br>
particles and nonparticulate substrate surfaces. The<br>
particles that are suitable in accordance with the<br>
invention include pigments, fillers and nanoparticles.<br>
Pigments are pulverulent or platelet-shaped colorants,<br>
which in contrast to dyes are insoluble in the<br>
surrounding medium (DIN 55943: 1993-11, DIN:EN 971:1<br>
1996-09). Pigments influence or determine the colora-<br>
tion and for reasons of cost are used in amounts as low<br>
as possible. Forces of interaction may cause the<br>
pigment particles to agglomerate, particularly during<br>
incorporation into the matrix material. This results,<br>
for example, in quality detractions in the resulting<br>
paint, as a result, among other things, of deficient<br>
color strength, sedimentation or phase separation.<br>
Preferred pigments are titanium dioxide, iron oxide,<br>
zinc oxide, carbon black, Cu phthalocyanine pigments,<br>
platelet-shaped pigments, such as mica (with or without<br>
oxidic and metallic coatings) or aluminum. Examples of<br>
fillers which can be used include barium sulfate and<br>
talc. Nanoparticles which can be used include iron<br>
oxide, titanium dioxide and silicon dioxide particles<br>
and also nanoclays. Nanoclays are composed, for<br>
example, of montmorillonite, bentonite, synthetic<br>
hectorite or hydrotalcite. They have an extent of less<br>
than 1 (am along their longest extent. Preferably they<br>
have a length of several 100 nm and a thickness of less<br>
than 10 nm. Nanoclays possess very high aspect ratios<br>
of up to 1000. The particles also include microfibers,<br>
such as glass, carbon, textile and polymer fibers.<br>
The substrate surfaces may also be nonparticulate<br>
surfaces, such as those of glass, metal and<br>
semiconductors, for example. Particularly preferred<br>
surfaces are silicon dioxide wafers used in the<br>
semiconductor industry.<br>
The LCST polymers of the invention are preferably<br>
contacted in a liquid medium (e.g., in an aqueous or<br>
organic medium) at below the LCST temperature with the<br>
particles or with the nonparticulate substrate<br>
surfaces, and then the temperature is raised to above<br>
the LCST temperature and the polymers are polymerized<br>
by the double bonds at this temperature or a higher<br>
temperature on the surface of the particles or on the<br>
nonparticulate substrate surfaces.<br>
The invention further provides particles or<br>
nonparticulate substrate surfaces coated with the<br>
polymerized LCST polymer.<br>
The invention is illustrated without restriction by the<br>
examples which follow.<br>

peroxide are added and the mixture is heated at the<br>
boiling point of the toluene for 12 h. The copolymer is<br>

The copolymer can be modified by esterification in<br>
accordance with the prior art. For that purpose the<br>
copolymer is dissolved in 500 ml of toluene and the<br>
solution is mixed with 25.37 g of allyl alcohol. The<br>
alcohol can also be added in portions or continuously<br>
during the reaction. Further, the mixture is admixed<br>
with 0.1% to 5% by weight of esterification catalyst<br>
(sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, p-toluenesulfonic<br>
acid, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, alkaline (earth)<br>
metal (hydr)oxides or metal alkoxides). The esterifi-<br>
cation is carried out at liquid-phase temperatures of<br>
80 to 120Â°C. To prevent unwanted polymerizations the<br>
reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence<br>
of small amounts of commercially customary<br>
polymerization inhibitors (e.g., hydroquinone monoalkyl<br>
ethers, 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, N-nitrosamine, pheno-<br>
thiazine or phosphoric esters). These compounds are<br>

The acid can also be added in portions or continuously<br>

pyrrolidone and 5 mol% hydroxyethyl methacrylate with<br>
subsequent modification with 5 mol% a,a-dimethyl-meta-<br>

In a 2-liter three-necked flask provided with stirrer,<br>
reflux condenser and nitrogen feed line, 135.2 g of<br>
N-vinylcaprolactam, 4 9.8 g of N-vinylpyrrolidone and<br>

penylbenzyl isocyanate at about 80Â°C for a further five<br>

Example 21 (Comparative)<br>
LCST polymer with only two functional groups for<br>
immobilization on the particle<br>
a) Preparation of the initiator solution<br>
In a 2-liter three-necked flask with reflux condenser,<br>
mounted with a drying tube, and nitrogen feed line,<br>
1000 ml of tetrahydrofuran, distilled repeatedly over<br>
sodium, 40 g of naphthalene and 6 g of sodium chips are<br>
stirred at 20Â°C under an absolutely dry nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. Over the course of 2 h the sodium passes<br>
into solution, to form the addition compound, which is<br>
deep green in color. The solution prepared is then 0.25<br>
molar with respect to sodium.<br>
b) Implementation of the polymerization:<br>
The following operations must likewise be carried out<br>
with careful exclusion of air and moisture.<br>
A 1-liter three-necked flask is charged under a pure<br>
nitrogen atmosphere with 300 ml of tetrahydrofuran<br>
freshly distilled over sodium. Then 20 ml of the<br>
naphthalene-sodium solution from a) are transferred to<br>
a dropping funnel mounted on the flask, and a few drops<br>
of this solution are used to remove the final<br>
impurities in the flask. As soon as the green color is<br>
maintained, 500 ml of this 0.25 M solution are run in.<br>
Subsequently, over the course of 30 minutes and with<br>
vigorous stirring, a solution of 317 g of N,N-diethyl-<br>
acrylamide (2.5 mol) in 1000 ml of tetrahydrofuran is<br>
added dropwise. The solution changes color immediately.<br>
External cooling is used to maintain the temperature at<br>
15 to 20 Â°C, and the N,N-diethylacrylamide added<br>
dropwise undergoes polymerization virtually in a few<br>
seconds. After the end of the addition of N,N-diethyl-<br>
acrylamide the polymerization is terminated by addition<br>
of an excess of 12 g of acryloyl chloride. The reaction<br>
mixture is worked up by adding 10 ml of methanol before<br>
the solvent is stripped off. The product obtained has<br>
an average molar mass of about 4700 g/mol and an LCST<br>
of about 39Â°C.<br>
Example 22 (Comparative)<br>

zation on the particle<br>

lactam takes place in the same way as that of the<br>
N,N-diethylacrylamide of Example 21. The product<br>
obtained has an average molar mass of about 5700 g/mol<br>
and an LCST of about 32Â°C.<br>
Example 23 (Comparative)<br>
LCST polymer with two functional groups for immobili-<br>
zation on the particle<br>
The polymerization of 145 g (2.5 mol) of methyl vinyl<br>
ether takes place in the same way as that of the<br>
N,N-diethylacrylamide of Example 21. The sticky product<br>
obtained has an average molar mass of about 2500 g/mol<br>
and an LCST of about 28 to 30Â°C.<br>

A pearlescent pigment (Iriodin AfflairÂ® 504,<br>
manufacturer: Merck KgaA, Darmstadt) is coated with the<br>
LCST polymers according to the product versions from<br>
the examples. To investigate the efficiency of the<br>
polymeric coating of particles, the use of platelet-<br>
shaped pearlescent pigments has proven appropriate. For<br>
this purpose the water absorption of a paint containing<br>
the inventively coated pearlescent pigments is<br>
measured. The point of interest here is the comparison<br>
between the polymer coatings with high and low degrees<br>
of crosslinking or without crosslinking.<br>

For the treatment of Iriodin AfflairÂ® 504 with the LCST<br>
polymer from Example 1, a 0.5% strength polymer<br>
solution is used. The pigment (10% by weight) is<br>
dispersed in water at 800 rpm for 15 minutes. The<br>
dispersion is subsequently cooled to a temperature of<br>
10Â°C. Following the addition of the polymer solution,<br>
the pigment is coated with the polymer at 40Â°C for 30<br>
minutes, and the precipitated polymer is then<br>
crosslinked for 3 h. The initiator system used is, per<br>
gram of polymer, 0.8 g of sodium pyrosulfite, 0.4 g of<br>
iron(II) sulfate and 0.8 g of potassium peroxodisul-<br>
fate. The polymer concentration, based on pigment, was<br>
5% by weight.<br>

The pigment samples were tested as follows:<br>
Water immersion test:<br>
For the test a conventional paint system for automotive<br>
finishes was used, with the following composition:<br>
The pigment samples were incorporated into the paint<br>
system and the test samples were produced as films<br>
using the doctor blade (500 Âµm coat thickness) . Testing<br>
was carried out in a one-coat system after 16 hours at<br>
66Â°C and after 20 hours at 80Â°C. The test samples are<br>
half-immersed in distilled water. The visual assessment<br>
of the graying after weathering was made in accordance<br>
with ISO 105-A02 24 hours after the end of exposure.<br>
The assessment scale ranges from 5 (very good) to 1<br>
(very poor).<br>

Setal 6306 SS-60: watersoluble polyester polyol for<br>
waterborne basecoats<br>
Setal 6407 SQ-26: watersoluble polyester polyol for<br>
waterborne basecoats.<br>
The pigment sample were also incorporated into the<br>
waterborne paint system and the test sample were produced as<br>
films with the doctor blade (500 Âµm coat thickness) . Testing<br>
was carried out in accordance with DIN 50017 (constant<br>
condensation water climate) 10 minutes to one hour after the<br>
end of exposure.<br>
The assessment of the blistering was made visually in<br>
accordance with DIN 53209. The evaluation scale ranges from<br>
0 (very good) to 5 (very poor).<br>
The swelling process was assessed visually along the<br>
lines of DIN 53230. In the relative evaluation scale<br>
the figure 0 has the following meaning: "unchanged" and<br>
the figure 5 has the following meaning: "greatly<br>
changed".<br>
The blank sample shows that even a pure waterborne<br>
paint system, i.e., without pigment fraction, likewise<br>
absorbs water and slight swelling occurs.<br>
The comparison of the results of measurement in Table 1<br>
shows clearly that the inventively coated pigments have<br>
a higher stability in waterborne paint systems than the<br>
pigments coated with the comparison polymers (Ex. 21,<br>
22, 23, 24) . The tighter crosslinking of the polymers<br>
of the invention leads to a greater barrier effect,<br>
thereby effectively preventing the penetration of water<br>
into the coating polymer.<br>
Use Example 25<br>
A semiconductor wafer with a silicon dioxide surface<br>
measuring 1 x 1 cm is immersed in 3 ml of distilled<br>
water. It is cooled to 10Â°C, and then 0.2 ml of a 10%<br>
strength by weight LCST copolymer solution from<br>
Example 1 is added. After two hours at 10Â°C the<br>
solution is heated to 40Â°C over the course of an hour.<br>
Thereafter it is cooled to 10Â°C again, but only for a<br>
period of 10 minutes, and heated to 40Â°C within an<br>
hour. This cycle of cooling and heating is carried out<br>
a total of three times. After the final cycle the wafer<br>
remains for 24 hours in the liquid coating medium at<br>
40Â°C and is subsequently rinsed off with distilled<br>
water. The polymer layer is then crosslinked under<br>
thermal induction; for this purpose the wafer is heated<br>
in a drying oven at temperatures of 70 to 100Â°C for<br>
five hours. Another possibility for crosslinking the<br>
polymer layer consists in irradiating the coated wafer<br>
for five hours with intense visible light.<br>
In a similar way the silicon wafer is treated with the<br>
LCST polymer according to Examples 2 to 16, the<br>
temperature range of the polymer solution in the<br>
coating operation corresponding to those of the<br>
respective use examples. The crosslinking operation<br>
takes place in the same way as for the polymer of<br>
Example 1.<br>
The semiconductor wafer coated by the process described<br>
above with the LCST polymer possesses a more strongly<br>
hydrophobic surface than a wafer without coating. This<br>
can be documented experimentally by droplets of water<br>
applied to the surface. The coated surface, which is<br>
therefore more hydrophobic, is wetted less well by<br>
water than the unmodified surface. The water droplet<br>
beads off from the coated wafer; on the surface which<br>
has not been modified, the droplet spreads.<br>
