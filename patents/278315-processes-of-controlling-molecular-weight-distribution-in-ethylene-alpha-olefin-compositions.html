DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
General Definitions<br>
[0008]       If and when employed herein the following terms shall have the given meaning<br>
for the purposes of this invention:	,    ,,.   ...<br>
[0009]       "Polymer" means a polymeric compound prepared by polymerizing monomers, whether of the same or a different type. The generic term "polymer" embraces the terms "homopolymer," "copolymer," "terpolymer" as well as "Interpolymer."<br>
[0010]        "Interpolymer" means a polymer prepared by the polymerization of at least two different types of monomers. The generic term "interpolymer" includes the term "copolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from two different monomers) as well as the term "terpolymer" (which is usually employed to refer to a polymer prepared from tliree different types of monomers). It also encompasses polymers made by polymerizing four or more types of monomers.<br>
[0011]       The term "multi-block copolymer" or "segmented copolymer" refers to a polymer comprising two or more chemically distinct regions or segments (referred to as "blocks") preferably joined in a linear manner, that is, a polymer comprising chemically differentiated units which are joined end-to-end with respect to polymerized ethylenic functionality, rather than in pendent or grafted fashion. In a preferred embodiment, the blocks differ in the amount or type of comonomer incorporated therein, the density, the amount of crystailinity, the crystallite size attributable to a polymer of such composition, the type or degree of tacticity (isotactic or syndiotactic), rcgio-regularity or regio-irregularity, the amount of branching, including long chain branching or hyper-branching, the homogeneity, or any other chemical or physical property. The multi-block copolymers are<br>
 <br>
characterized by unique distributions of both polydispersity index (PDI or Mw/Mn), block length distribution, and/or block number distribution due to the unique process making of the copolymers. More specifically, when produced in a continuous process, the multi-block polymers often possess PDI from 1.7 to 2.9, preferably from 1.8 to 2.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably from 1.8 to 2.1.<br>
[0012]       In the following description, all numbers disclosed herein are approximate values, regardless whether the word "about" or "approximate" is used in connection therewith. They may vary by 1 percent, 2 percent, 5 percent, or, sometimes, 10 to 20 percent. Whenever a numerical range with a lower limit, R1 and an upper limit, RU, is disclosed, any number falling within the range is specifically disclosed. In particulso:, the following numbers within the range are specifically disclosed: R=RL+k*(RU-RL), wherein k is a variable ranging from 1 percent to 100 percent with a 1 percent increment, i.e., k is 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent,..., 50 percent, 51 percent, 52 percent,..., 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, or 100 percent. Moreover, any numerical range defined by two R numbers as defined in the above is also specifically disclosed.<br>
10013]       "Density" is tested in accordance with ASTM D792.<br>
[0014]       "Melt Index (I2)" is determined according to ASTM D1238 using a weight of 2.16 kg at 190°C for polymers comprising ethylene as the major component in the polymer.<br>
[0015] "Melt Flow Rate (MFR)" is determined for according to ASTM D1238 using a weight of 2.16 kg at 230°C for polymers comprising propylene as the major component in the polymer.<br>
[0016] "Molecular weight distribution" or MWD is measured by conventional GPC per the procedure described by Williams, T.; Ward, I. M. Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters Edition (1968), 6(9), 621-624. Coefficient B is 1. Coefficient A is 0.4316.<br>
Controlling Molecular Weight and Density<br>
[0017]       It has been discovered that the molecular weight distribution of a resulting polymer may be controlled. For example, using the proper reaction conditions (e.g., a well mixed homogeneous reaction environment, a steady-state concentration of two or more monomers such as ethylene and an a-olefin like octene, and a proper pre-catalyst or catalyst) the bimodal molecular weight "split" of the polymer may be controlled by the<br>
 <br>
mole fractions (/) of the two or more monomers, n, such that the mole fraction of monomer m is defined as: <br>
[0018]       That is, the molecular weight split can be controlled so that it is basically a function of the relative monomer concentrations in solution. These same relative monomer concentrations also, depending upon the reaction conditions, may determine the overall composition (i.e. density) of the total polymer.<br>
[0019]       One aspect of controlling monomer purity useful herein is by utilizing a side stream of monomer in contact with a selected catalyst in a plug flow reactor. If the monomer is impure, then a lower than expected exotherm will be observed in the plug flow reactor. In this manner, monomer purity is monitored and adjusted if necessary.<br>
[0020]       While not wishing to be bound by any theory the Applicants have discovered that the reason that the monomer concentrationzmolecular weight split relationship can be made to occur is that a different catalyst species can be made from each monomer reactant This means that a lower molecular weight polymer is formed by an "ethyiene-inserted" form of the catalyst, while an "a-olefin-inserted" form of the catalyst gives a higher molecular weight polymer. Advantageously, this results in a molecular weight split which is controlled by controlling the relative amounts of the various catalyst species that are formed.<br>
[0021]       As an example it is believed that the Hafnium catalyst below can be made to form an ethyiene-inserted cation and an octene-inserted cation in the presence of ethylene and octene and the proper reaction conditions including, for example, a well mixed homogeneous reaction environment.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0022]       Therefore, the present invention allows one to control the molecular weight split in numerous ways. One method of the present invention involves changing the ligand structure of a given catalyst to affect the resulting split for a given overall density copolymer. Thus, one may select suitable pre-catalyst(s) for the polymerization to control the concentrations of an ethylene-inserted cation and/or an octene-inserted cation and thereby control the resulting molecular weight split. Alternatively, the present invention allows one to control the polymer split from a given catalyst precursor. For example, one such method would be to do a pre-reaction or pre-polymerization of sorts, e.g., contacting a pre-catalyst with a single monomer to generate the desired catalyst species concentrations, then feeding part or all of this pre-reaction product to the reactor. This could optionally be done with the addition of pure pre-catalyst, providing a high degree of control over the resulting polymer bimodality.<br>
 <br>
[0023]       In yet anotlier alternative of the present invention, the polymer split can be modified by changing process variables. For example, one can control the amount of inserted catalyst by controlling composition gradients ~ especially in instances when the insertion occurs in the early stages of catalyst activation. In a solution loop reactor, for example, a gradient of monomer composition can be achieved by modifying the speed at which the reactor effluent circulates through the reactor. This can result in differences in the comonomer mole fraction at different places within the reactor. The reactor can be configured to take advantage of tliis by strategic placement of catalyst and monomer injection points and/or the timing of said catalyst and monomer contact.<br>
[0024]       In yet another alternative, one or more compounds can be synthesized directly so that the desired ratio of ethylene-inseited cation:a-olefin-inserted cation can be directly controlled.<br>
 <br>
General Processes of Using a Pre-Catalyst to Control Molecular Weight<br>
[0025]       As stated above, the Applicants have discovered a number of ways to control the molecular weight distribution in the production of an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer composition. One process comprises:<br>
(a)	selecting at least one suitable pre-catalyst comprising at least one metal-aryl or metal-hydrocarbyl bond, wherein each pre-catalyst molecule is essentially the same as every other pre-catalyst molecule;<br>
(b)	contacting ethylene, at least one a-olefin, and said suitable pre-catalyst;<br>
(c)	selecting ethylene:alpha-olefin concentration ratios sufficient to activate the pre-catalyst, and<br>
(d)	forming an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer composition under continuous reaction polymerization conditions; and, optionally,<br>
(e)	selecting a molecular weight split of the interpolymer as determined by the mole fractions (/) of the two or more monomers, n, such that the mole fraction of monomer m is defined as: <br>
to produce an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer composition with a controlled bimodal or multi-modal molecular weight distribution. [0026]       Another process comprises:<br>
(a)	selecting at least one suitable pre-catalyst comprising at least one metal-aryl or metal-hydrocarbyl bond, wherein each pre-catalyst molecule is essentially the same as every other pre-catalyst molecule;<br>
(b)	contacting at least one organic compound, and said suitable pre-catalyst;<br>
I	(c)        selecting at least one organic compound concentration sufficient to activate<br>
the pre-catalyst, and<br>
(d)	forming an ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer composition under continuous reaction polytnerization conditions; and, optionally,<br>
(e)	selecting a molecular weight split of the interpolymer as determined by the concentration of the one or more organic compound(s) to produce an ethylene/a-<br>
 <br>
olefin interpolymer composition with a controlled bimodal or multi-modal molecular<br>
weight distribution.<br>
Suitable Pre-catalyst Contact With (1) Ethylene and an a-oleHn or (2) Organic Compound<br>
[0027]       The suitable pre-catalysts may be selected from any of those comprising at least one metal-aryl or metal-hydrocarbyl bond. The aryl may be any molecule or ligand which has the ring structure characteristic of, for example, phenyl, naphalenyl, phenanthrenyl, anthracenyl, etc. The hydrocarbyl may be any molecule or ligand comprising hydrogen and carbon such as benzyl. Additionally, a heteroatom such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc. may be substitoted for one or more carbon atoms of the aryl or hydrocarbyl such that aryl includes heteroaryl and hydrocarbyl includes heterohydrocarbyl. Similarly, one or more hydrogens on the aryl or hydrocarbyl may be replaced with any substituent which does not substantially interfere with the desired activity of the pre-catalyst. Such substituents include, but are not limited to, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, halo, nitro, amino, alkoxy, aryl, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, hydroxy, and the like. Preferably each pre-cataiyst molecule is essentially the same as every other pre-catalyst molecule. By this is meant that the chemical structures of the molecules are substantially the same. Also preferable are those stmctures in which ring strain is capable of being relieved from the metal-hydrocarbyl ligand when contacted with ethylene or an a-olefin.<br>
[0028]       Particularly suitable pre-catalysts are selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbylamine substituted heteroaryl compounds corresponding to the formula:<br>
wherein: <br>
R11 selected from alkyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloheteroalkyi, aryl, and inertly substituted derivatives thereof containing from 1 to 30 atoms not counting hydrogen or a divalent derivative thereof;<br>
T' is a divalent bridging group of from 1 to 41 atoms other than hydrogen, preferably 1 to 20 atoms atoms other than hydrogen, and most preferably a mono- or di- C1.20 hydrocarbyl substituted methylene or silane group; and<br>
 <br>
R12 is a C5.20 heteroaryl group containing Lewis base functionality, especially a pyridin-2-yl- or substituted pyridin-2-yl group or a divalent derivative thereof;<br>
M1' comprises hafnium or other Group 4 metal;<br>
X1is an anionic, neutral or dianionic ligand group;<br>
x' is a number from 0 to 5 indicating the number of such X1 groups; and<br>
bonds, optional bonds and electron donative interactions are represented by lines, dotted lines and arrows respectively, or a mixture thereof, in contact with a suitable co-catalyst.<br>
[0029]       The pre-catalyst and optional catalysts if desired are contacted with either (1) ethylene and an a-olefin or (2) an organic compound such as, for example, acetone or a mixture of ketones or (3) mixtures thereof, in a manner and in amounts sufficient to activate the pre-catalyst. One skilled in the art will recognize that a cocatalyst such as the ones described below may be useful at this stage or a later stage. The conditions will generally vary depending upon the polymer desired and the equipment employed. However, one skilled in the art can readily determine the suitable conditions using the instant specification, background knowledge, the prior art, and routine experimentation. Guidance is given in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,960,635; 6,946,535; 6,943,215; 6,927,256; 6,919,407; and 6,906,160 which are incorporated herein by reference. One advantage of the instant processes is that a single catalyst may be employed in a single reactor.<br>
[0030]       The ethylene, a-olefin, and/or organic compound concentrations are typically '      selected so as to be sufficient to activate the pre-catalyst, and form the desired ethylene/a-olefin interpolymer composition having the desired molecular weight distribution. These activation conditions vary depending on the reactants and equipment empldyed and may be the same but are preferably different than the continuous polymerization reaction conditions used to form the interpolymer. More specifically, the initial monomer ratio used during activation may be the same but is preferably different than the monomer ratio used during the interpolymer polymerization. While these ratios often vary according the reaction conditions and the product desired, the molecular weight split of the interpolymer may usually be controlled by selecting the mole fractions (/) of the two or more monomers, n, such that the mole fraction of monomer m is defined as:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0031]       Advantageously, the resulting polymer often has a low molecular weight portion that has a higher density than the high molecular weight portion. While batch or continuous polymerization reaction conditions may be employed,,it is preferable to employ continuous polymerization reaction conditions during the formation of the interpolymer. However, continuous polymerization reaction conditions can still be employed even if the pre-catalyst is activated separately from the main polymerization.<br>
General Processes of Using a Synthesized Catalyst to Control Molecular Weight Distribution<br>
[0032]       Another process of controlling molecular weight comprises contacting ethylene, an a-olefin, and a suitable catalyst under reaction conditions sufficient to form an ethylene/a-olefm interpolymerr composition wherein the catalyst comprises a catalytic amount of a molecule having the structure:<br>
 <br>
wherein M = group 2-8 metal, preferably group 4 as a neutral or charged moiety;<br>
Y = any substituent including fused rings;<br>
L = any ligating group, especially a pyridyl or pyridylamide;<br>
X = alkyl, aryl, substimted allcyl, H or hydride, halide, or other anionic moiety;<br>
y = an integer from 0 to the complete valence of M;<br>
R = alkyl, aryl, haloalkyl, haloaryl, hydrogen, etc;<br>
X = 1 - 6, especially 2;<br>
Dashed line = optional bond, especially a weak bond; and<br>
X and (CR2)x may be tethered or part of a ring.<br>
[0033]        Use of various forms of the aforementioned catalyst structure allows one skilled in the art to directly control the concentrations of an "ethylene-inserted" form of the catalyst and an "a-olefin-inserted" form of the catalyst. By directly controlling these concentrations the molecular weight split of the interpolymer may be controlled. This allows one skilled in the art to employ a much wider range of reaction conditions yet still control the molecular weight distribution. For example, it is then possible to control the molecular weight distribution over a wider range of monomer concentrations.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
[0035]       As one skilled in the art can appreciate it may also be desirable in some situations to use an in-situ synthesis method such that the catalyst is formed during the polymerization reaction.<br>
Cocatalvsts<br>
[0036]       As one skilled in the art will appreciate it may be useful to combine the pre-catalyst or synthesized catalyst with a suitable cocatalyst, preferably a cation forming cocatalyst, a strong Lewis acid, or a combination thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the shuttling agent, if employed, is employed both for purposes of chain shuttling and as the cocatalyst component of the catalyst composition.<br>
[0037]       The metal complexes desirably are rendered catalytically active by combination with a cation forming cocatalyst, such as those previously known in the art for use with Group 4 metal olefin polymerization complexes. Suitable cation forming cocatalysts for use herein include neutral Lewis acids, such as C1.30 hydrocarbyl substituted Group 13 compounds, especially tri(hydrocarbyl)aluminum- or tri(hydrocarbyl)boron compounds and halogenated (including perhalogenated) derivatives thereof, having from 1 to 10 carbons in each hydrocarbyl or halogenated hydrocarbyl group, more especially perfluorinated tri(aryI)boron compounds, and most especially tris(pentafluoro-phenyI)borane; nonpolymeric, compatible, noncoordinating, ion forming compounds (including the use of such compounds under oxidizing conditions), especially the use of ammonium-, phosphonium-, oxoniura-, carbonium-, silylium- or sulfonium- salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions, or ferrocenium-, lead- or silver salts of compatible, noncoordinating anions; and combinations of the foregoing cation forming cocatalysts and techniques. The foregoing activating cocatalysts and activating techniques have been previously taught with respect to different metal complexes for olefin polymerizations in the following references: EP-A~277,003, US-A-5,153,157. US-A-5,064,802, US-A-5,321,106, US-A-5,721,185, US-A-5,350,723, US-A-5,425,872. US-A-5,625,087, US-A-5,8B3,204, US-A-5,919,983, US-A-5,783,512, WO 99/15534, and W099/42467.<br>
[0038]       Combinations of neutral Lewis acids, especially the combination of a trialkjd aluminum compound having from 1 to 4 carbons in each alkyl group and a halogenated tri(hydrocarbyI)boron compound having from 1 to 20 carbons in each hydrocarbyl group, especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane, further combinations of such neutral Lewis acid mixtures with a polymeric or oligoraeric alumoxane, and combinations of a single neutral Lewis acid, especially tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane with a polymeric or oligomeric<br>
 <br>
alumoxane may be used as activating cocatalysts. Preferred molar ratios of metal complex:tris(pentafluorophenyl-borane:alumoxane are from 1:1:1 to 1:5:20, more preferably from 1:1:1.5 to 1:5:10.<br>
[0039]       Suitable ion forming compounds useful as cocatalysts in one embodiment of the present invention comprise a cation which is a Bronsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible, noncoordinating anion. A". As used herein, the term "noncoordinating" means an anion or substance which either does not coordinate to the Group 4 metal containing precursor complex and the catalytic derivative derived there from, or which is only weakly coordinated to such complexes thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. A noncoordinating anion specifically refers to an anion which when functioning as a charge balancing anion in a cationic metal complex does not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment thereof to said cation thereby forming neutral complexes. "Compatible anions" are anions which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes and are noninterfering with desired subsequent polymerization or other uses of the complex.<br>
[0040]       Preferred anions are those containing a siagle coordination complex comprising a charge-bearing metal or metalloid core which anion is capable of balancing the charge of the active catalyst species (the metal cation) which may be formed when the two components are combined. Also, said anion should be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic, diolefinic and acetylenically unsaturated compounds or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers or nitriles. Suitable metals include, but are not limited to, aluminum, gold and platinum. Suitable metalloids include, but are not limited to, boron, phosphorus, and silicon. Compounds contairdng anions which comprise coordination complexes containing a single metal or metalloid atom are, of course, well known and many, particularly such compounds containing a single boron atom in the anion portion, are available commercially.<br>
[0041]       Preferably such cocatalysts may be represented by the following general formula:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Ag is a noncoordinating, compatible anion having a charge of g-, and g is an integer from 1 to 3, [0042]       More preferably A®' corresponds to the formula: [M'Q4]';<br>
wherein:<br>
M' is boron or aluminum in the +3 formal oxidation state; and<br>
Q independently each occurrence is selected from hydride, dialkylamido, halide, hydrocarbyl, hydrocarbyloxide, halosubstituted-hydrocarbyl, halosubstituted hydrocarbyioxy, and halo- substituted silylhydrocarbyl radicals (including perhalogenated hydrocarbyl- perhalogenated hydrocarbyioxy- and perhalogenated silylhydrocarbyl radicals), said Q having up to 20 carbons with the proviso that in not more than one occurrence is Q halide. Examples of suitable hydrocarbyloxide Q groups are disclosed in US-A-5,296,433.<br>
[0043]        In a more preferred embodiment, d is one, that is, the counter ion has a single negative charge and is A'. Activating cocatalysts comprising boron which are particularly useful in the preparation of catalysts of this invention may be represented by the following general formula:<br>
(L*-H)+(BQ4)-; wherein:<br>
L* is as previously defined;<br>
B is boron in a formal oxidation state of 3; and<br>
Q is a hydrocarbyl-, hydrocarbyioxy-, fluorinated hydrocarbyl-, fluorinated hydrocarbyioxy-, or fluorinated silylhydrocarbyl- group of up to 20 nonhydrogen atoms, with the proviso that in not more than one occasion is Q hydrocarbyl.<br>
[0044]       Preferred Lewis base salts are ammonium salts, more preferably trialkylammonium salts containing one or more C1240 alkyl groups. Most preferably, Q is each occurrence a fluorinated aryl group, especially, a pentafluorophenyl group.<br>
[0045]       Illustrative, but not limiting, examples of boron compounds which may be used as an activating cocatalyst in the preparation of the improved catalysts of this invention are<br>
tri-substituted ammonium salts such as:<br>
 <br>
triraethylammonium tetrakis(peatafluorophenyl) borate,<br>
triethylammoniuin tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) borate,<br>

[0061]       The polymers of the present invention can be used in a variety of conventional thermoplastic fabrication processes to produce useful articles. Such articles include objects comprising at least one film layer, such as a monolayer film, or at least one layer in a multilayer film prepared by cast, blown, calendered, or extrusion coating processes; molded articles, such as blow molded, injection molded, or rotomolded articles; extrusions; fibers; and woven or non-woven fabrics.

Compositions comprising the olefin polymers can also be formed into fabricated articles such as those previously mentioned using conventional polyolefm processing techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art of polyolefin processing. Dispersions, both aqueous and non-aqueous, can also be formed using the polymers or formulations comprising the same. Frothed foams comprising the invented polymers can also be formed, as disclosed in PCT application No. PCT/US2004/027593, filed August 25,2004, and published as WO2005/021622. The polymers may also be crosslinked by any known means, such as the use of peroxide, electron beam, silane, azide, or other cross-linking technique. The polymers can also be chemically modiiied, such as by grafting (for example by use of maleic anhydride (MAH), silanes, or other grafting agent), halogenation, amination, sulfonation, or other chemical modification.<br>
[0062]       Suitable end uses for the foregoing products include elastic films and fibers; soft touch goods, such as tooth brush handles and appliance handles;antiblocking compositions; cap liners, gaskets and profiles; adhesives (including hot melt adhesives and pressure sensitive adhesives); footwear (including shoe soles and shoe liners); auto interior parts and profiles; foam goods (both open and closed cell); impact modifiers for other thermoplastic polymers; coated fabrics; hoses; tubing; weather stripping; cap liners; flooring; and viscosity index modifiers, also known as pour point modifiers, for lubricants.<br>
Examples<br>
[0063]       As stated above, the bimodal molecular weight "split" of the polymer may be<br>
selected by controlling the mole fractions (/) of the two or more monomers, n, such that the mole fraction of monomer m is defined as:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
[0064]       This may be quantified for an ethylexne-octene copolymer as depicted in Figures 20 and 21. At low/2, the low molecular weight fraction predominates, but at higherf2, the higher molecular weight species is more prevalent.<br>
General Experimental Considerations<br>
[0065]       Unless specified otherwise, all reagents are handled under anaerobic conditions using standard procedures for the handling of extremely air- and water-sensitive materials. Solvents are used without further purification. All other chemicals are commercial materials and are used as received.<br>
General Reactor Polymerization Procedure<br>
[0066]       A 1 ga. AE autoclave is purged at high temperature with N2. Isopar®E was added, and the reactor is heated to 120 °C. 1-Octene and hydrogen are added batchwise to the reactor and are not regulated during the run. The reactor is the pressurized with ethylene (450 psi). Solutions of the pre-catalyst, cocatalyst (1.2 equivalents to pre-catalyst), and a scavenger (5 equivalents to pre-catalyst) are mixed and then added to the reactor using a flush of high pressure Isopar®E. Polymer yield is kept low to minimize monomer composition drift during tihe experiment. After the prescribed reaction time, reactor contents are dumped into a resin kettle and mixed with Irganox®1010/Irgafos®168 stabilizer mixture (1 g). The polymer is recovered by evaporating the majority of the solvent at room temperature and then dried further in a vacuum oven overnight at 90 "C. Following the mn, the reactor is hot-flushed with Isopar®E to prevent polymer contamination from nm to run.<br>

Examples 12-15. Continuous Solution Polymerization, Catalyst Al [00671       Continuous solution polymerizations are carried out in a computer controlled autoclave reactor equipped with an internal stirrer. Purified mixed alkanes solvent (IsoparTm E available from ExxonMobil, Inc.), ethylene, 1-octene, and hydrogen (where used) are supplied to a reactor equipped with a jacket for temperature control and an internal thermocouple. The solvent feed to the reactor is measured by a mass-flow controller. A variable speed diaphragm pump controls the solvent flow rate and pressure to the reactor. At the discharge of the pump, a side stream is taken to provide flush flows for the catalyst and cocatalyst 1 injection lines and the reactor agitator. These flows are measured by Micro-Motion mass flow meters and controlled by control valves or by the manual adjustment of needle valves. The remaining solvent is combined with 1-octene, ethylene, and hydrogen (where used) and fed to the reactor. A mass flow controller is used to deliver hydrogen to the reactor as needed. The temperature of the solvent/monomer solution is controlled by use of a heat exchanger before entering the reactor. This stream enters the bottom of the reactor. The catalyst component solutions are metered using pumps and mass flow meters and are combined with the catalyst flush solvent and introduced into the bottom of the reactor. The reactor is run liquid-full at 500 psig (3.45 MPa) with vigorous stirring.<br>
 <br>
Product is removed through exit lines at the top of the reactor. All exit lines from the reactor are steam traced and insulated. Polymerization is stopped by the addition of a small amount of water into the exit line along with any stabilizers or other additives and passing the mixture through a static mixer. The product stream is then heated by passing through a heat exchanger before devolatilization. The polymer product is recovered by extrusion using a devolatilizing extruder and water cooled pelletizer. Process details and results are contained in Table 2. Selected polymer properties are provided in Table 3.<br>

[0069]       To support the instant invention calculations were carried out using the commercially-available software package, Gaussian98 Revision A. 10 distributed by Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh PA, 2001. The computations utilized the density functional theory (DFT) method, B3LYP as described in, for example, Becke, A. D. J. Chem. Fhys. 1993, 98, 5648; Lee, C; Yang, W.; Parr, R. G. Phys. Rev B 1988, 57, 785; and Miehlich, B.; Savin, A.; StoE, H.; Preuss, H. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1989,157, 200 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In a few cases, the results were reconfirmed using conventional theory with correlation, M0ller-Plesset perturbation theory to second order (MP2) as described in, for example, M0ller, C; Plesset, M. S. Phys. Rev. 1934, 46, 618; Head-Gordon, M.; Pople, J. A.; Frisch, M. J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1988,253, 503; Frisch, M. J.; Head-Gordon, M.; Popie, J. A. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990,166, 275; Frisch, M. J.; Head-Gordon, M.; Pople, J. A. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990, 166, 281; Head-Gordon, M.; Head-Gordon, T. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1994, 220,122; and Saebo, S.; Almlof, J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1989,154, 83 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Qualitatively, the results using MP2 were similar to those for B3LYP. A series of different basis sets<br>
 <br>
were used and tested. Initially the modest LANL2DZ basis set as described in, for example, Dunning, Jr., T. H.; Hay, P. J. in Modem Theoretical Chemistry, Ed. H. F. Schaefer, HI, Plenum, New York, 1976, vol 3,1; Hay, P. J. Wadt, W. R. /. Chem. Phys. 1985, 52, 270; Wadt, W. R; Hay, P. J. J. Chem. Phys. 1985, 82, 284; and Hay, P. J. Wadt, W. R. /. Chem. Phys. 1985, 82, 299, was used for all atoms, but progressively larger basis sets were employed such as i) LANL2DZ on the transition metal and 6-3IG* on the all other atoms as described in Ditchfield, R.; Hehre, W. J.; Pople, J. A. /. Chem. Phys. 1971, 54, 724; Hehre, W. J.; Ditchfield, R.; Pople, J. A. J. Chem. Phys. 1972, 56, 2257; and Gordon, M. S. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980, 76, 163 and ii) LANL2DZ on the transition metal and 6-311G** on all other atoms as described in McLean, A. D.; Chandler, G. S. /. Chem. Phys. 1980, 72, 5639; and Krishnan, R.; Binkley, J. S.; Seeger, R.; Popie, J. A. J. Chem. Phys. 1980, 72, 650 and these did not qualitatively change the results. The inclusion of enthalpic and free energy corrections at a given temperature also did not change the results significantly.<br>
[0070]       The calculations involved locating four stationary points on the potential energy surface (see Diagram 1), Standard optimizations and defaults within the Gaussian98 program were utilized which included the Bemy optimizer in redundant internal coordinates as described in Peng, C; Ayala, P. Y.; Schiegel, H. B. Frisch, M. J. J. Camp. Chem. 1996,17, 49; and Peng, C; Schiegel, H. B. Israel. J. Chem. 1994, 55, 449. The four structures located were the transition state for ethylene inserting into the M-aryl or M-hydrocarbyl bond of the original species (1), the transition state for ethylene inserting in the polymery] chain of the original species (2), the product of inserting into the aryl or hydrocarbyl group (3), and the product of inserting into the polymeryl chain (4), The stationary points defined as transition states were confirmed by one and only one imaginary frequency (corresponding to the reaction coordinate) as determined from mass-weighting of the eigenvalues from the diagonaiization of the second derivative or Hessian matrix. The two products, 3 and 4, have no imaginary frequencies upon this analysis.<br>

<br>
faces lead to unique isomers. Thus for ethylene/octene polymerizations, up to ten unique 'inserted' catalysts are possible. The aforementioned calculations indicate that not all are favorable, but certainly more than one is possible. As described above, the Applicants have determined that different conditions can be used to favor one or some over others.<br>
 <br>
Diagram 3. Ethylene inserting into top and bottom faces of the initial catalyst. Whether these two products are different depends on the symmetry of the catalyst (groups at R and R')<br>
[0073]       Based on catalyst activity such as the one above, barriers important for the polymerization may be estimated. If insertion into the aryl or hydrocarby! is less than 10 kcal/mol higher than insertion into the alkyl, this reaction should occur during the polymerization cycle. From Diagrams 1 and 4, this implies that TS 1 lies no higher than 10 kcal/mol above TS 2. It is preferable that this difference is less than 5 kcai/mol and even more preferable that insertion into the aryl or hydrocarbyl is less than insertion into the alky. Insertion into the alkyl is not a reversible process, but to avoid reversibility of insertion into the aryl or hydrocarbyl, the product of insertion into the aryl or hydrocarbyl cannot lie more than 5 kcal/mol above insertion into the alkyl. From Diagrams land 4, this<br>
