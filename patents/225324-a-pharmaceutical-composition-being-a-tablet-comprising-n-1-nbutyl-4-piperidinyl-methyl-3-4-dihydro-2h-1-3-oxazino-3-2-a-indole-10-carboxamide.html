				<td>This invention relates to the use of certain compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of certain cardiovascular conditions such as atrial remodelling, and to the use of the compounds in the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation using specified dosages and/or dosage regimens.<br>
Introduction<br>
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most often met arrhythmia in the clinical setting. It is a major risk for embolic stroke and is associated with an increase in mortality risk. AF ( whose symptoms can include palpitations of the atrium, etc.) is a condition started by a "trigger", such as an atrial ectopic beat (irregular heart beat) or atrial tachycardia (flutter), interacting with a "substrate" such as abnormal atrial tissue for example having a spatial heterogeneity of refractoriness or anatomical sites of conduction block. The fibrillation consists of a wavefront of excitation travelling in a continuous circular path around the atrium. Once excited, the atrial tissue takes some time to recover to a state where it can be excited again, this time being called the "refractory period" (AERP = atrial effective refractory period). Thus if the refractory period is greater than the time for the excitation wavefront to circle through 360°, then the wavefront hits non-excitable "refractory" material and the fibrillation can stop, the heart returning to sinus rhythm. Otherwise, the AF wavelets undergo "re-entry" and the atrial fibrillation continues, sometimes almost indefinitely. Patients with paroxysmal AF often progress to chronic (persistent or permanent) AF. Indeed, interdependent with the above mentioned trigger and substrate, a facilitating factor contributes to the progression and perpetuation of the disease. The facilitator called atrial remodelling is caused by a variety of structural, cellular, electrophysiological, and neurohormonal changes (e.g. activation of sympathetic and/or renin-angiotensin systems) sometimes caused by the recurrence of AF episodes.   Some antiarrythmic drugs work in part by increasing the atrial refractory period and/or by increasing or decreasing the atrial "conduction velocity". Increasing the atrial refractory period will increase the atrial wavelength and thus decrease the number of re-entry wavelets and mitigating/reducing AF.   The wavelength for circus movement re-entry = the conduction velocity x the refractory period. See Tse FfF and Lau CP, Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol., May 1998, 25(5), 293-302; Lau CP and Tse HF, Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol, Dec 1997,24(12), 982-3; and Janse MJ, Eur. Heart. J., May 1997, 18 (Suppl. C), C12-C18 for reviews.<br><br>
Studies in patients with AF have shown that structural/anatomic changes can occur in the atria which can tend to sustain AF, but the relationship between the structural remodelling and the chronicity of the arrhythmia are not well understood. The changes mainly concern adaptive (dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes) and maladaptive (degeneration of cells with replacement fibrosis) features. (By fibrosis is meant e.g. an increase in connective tissue). Atrial dilatation and/or enlargement can also occur.  These structural changes are generally, though not always, observed during prolonged sustained AF. (See Thijssen VL et al., Cardiovasc Pathol 2000 Jan-Feb;9(l): 17-28; and Janse MJ, Eur Heart J 1997 May;18 Suppl C:C12-8 for reviews). On the other hand, in the setting of sustained atrial fibrillation, significant left atrial and left atrial appendage functional and anatomical remodelling (e.g. enlargement) have been found not to occur as a result of one to two months of sustained atrial fibrillation, a duration similar to that experienced by patients undergoing warfarin anticoagulation before electiv; cardioversion, in one study (Weigner MJ et al., Heart 1999 Nov;82(5):555-8 ).<br>
"Atrial remodelling" is the process in which mechanical and cellular changes in the atria (structural/anatomic changes) and/or electrophysiological (electrical) changes in the atria are generated, often as a result of the development of AF, though atrial remodelling is not always the result, i.e. is not the inevitable result, of atrial fibrillation, especially in paroxysmal AF patients. ^See Thijssen VL et al., Cardiovasc. Pathol, Jan-Feb 2000, 9(1), 17-28; Tie HF and Lau CP, Clin. Exp. Pharmacol Physiol, May 1998, 25(5), 293-302 (see especially pp. 293-295 and 299-300); Lau CP and Tse HF, Clin. Exp. Pharma-.ol Physiol., Dec 1997, 24(12), 982-3; and Janse MJ, Eur. Heart. J., May 1997, 18 (Suppl. C), C12-C18, for reviews of atrial fibrillation and atrial remodelling). These remodelling changes often tend to sustain AF. The structural/anatomic changes have been described above.<br>
"Electrophysiological (electrical) atrial remodelling" as referred to herein includes or means a) modification (especially shortening) of this atrial effective refractory period (AERP) or atrial refractoriness, b) modification of the rate adaption of the refractory period (e.g. disappearance of the normal rate adaption, so that, following the slowing of the heart rate, the refractory period does not prolong as expected), and/or c) modification of action potentials (e.g. shortening'of duration, change in configuration etc.). Preferably, electrophysiological (electrical) atrial remodelling means modification (especially shortening) of the axial effective refractory period (AERP) or atrial refractoriness.   Optionally, electrical atrial remodelling can also include modification (especially slowing) of the atrial conduction velocity and/or modification (especially an increase) in dispersion, 3.g. in dispersion of refractoriness. By "dispersion" is meant the difference in the magnitude of one or<br>
more electrical phenomena such as the refractory period (e.g. AERP) between spatially close areas of the tissue.<br>
The atrial effective refractory period (AERP), and/or a decrease or increase in AERP, can be determined by conventional techniques well known to the skilled person. For example, the AERP can be determined using the conventional single extrastimulus technique, e.g. as described in A. Bnl, B. Gout et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 276, 637-646. According to this publication (and also Example 2 of the present patent application, hereinafter), a 8-f timulus train at a basic cycle length 20% shorter than the sinus rhythm is followed by a single premature extrastimulus (4 ms, 1.5 times threshold current) introduced at progressively shorter coupling intervals from the atrial pacing until no atrial response is obtained. The AERP represents the longest coupling interval which fails to induce a propagated response in the tissue.<br>
For similar or alternative AERP measurement methods, see the references (e.g. references 14, 16, 17, 63, 64 and 66) cited in the review paper Tse HF and Lau CP, Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol, May 1998, 25(5), 293-302, see especially p. 299. For example, reference 66 of the Tse 1998 review 'E. G. Daoud et al., Circulation., 1996, 94, 1600-1606), discloses that atrial ERP can be measured by an incremental technique in 5-ms steps at basic drive cycle lengths of 350 and 500 ms for eight beats with a 1-second pause between pacing trains; the AERP is defined as the longest Si-82coupling interval that fails to result in atrial capture; thepre-AF atrial ERP can optionally be measured three times and averaged.   Alternatively, reference 63 of the Tse 1998 review (the well-cited 1995 paper of M.C.E.F. Wijffels et al., Atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation: A study in awake chronically instrumented goats, Circulation, 1995, 92(7), 1954-68) and the later paper of M.C.E.F. Wijffels et al., Circulation, 1997, 96, 3710-3720 disclose in their Methods sections a method of measuring AERP (eg. at left or right atrial appendage) during a wide range of atrial pacing frequencies (SiSj pacing interval, 120 to 600 ms). In this Wijffels method, a single premature stimulus (82) of four times the (diastolic) threshold is interpolated after every fifth basic (S182) interval. Starting from well within the refractory period (shorter than the AERP), the 8182 coupling interval is incremented in steps of 1 ms. The shortest 8182 interval resulting in a propagated (premature) atrial response is taken as the AERP. This Wijffels method of measuring the refractory period is fast (rsually taking 
In humans and pigs, 5-HT4 receptors are present in the atrium (see e.g. AJ Kaumann et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol (1990), 342: 619-622;<br>
AJ. Kaumann et al., Br J Pharmacol (1990) 100: 879-885). A subtype of the 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4^) has recently been characterized specifically in human atrium (O. Blondel et al, FEES Letters, 412, 1997, pp. 465-474) as well as in the pig atrium. This 5-HT4A receptor is not present in the ventricle.   For 5-HT receptor nomenclature in general, see D Hoyer, Neuropharmacology, 1997, 36(4/5), 419.<br>
WO 91/16045 and EP 0 526 540 Bl (SmithKline Beecham) disclose that cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists can be used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, and in reducing the occurrence of stroke. See also AJ. Kaumann, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 1994,15(12), 451-455; AJ. Kaumann, et al., Br. J. Pharmacol, 1994, 111 (Proc. Suppl. Jan), p.26P; S.S. Hegde et al., FASEB J., 1996, 10(12) 1398-1407; R. Pino et al., Cardiovascular Research (Netherlands), Dec 1998, 40(3), 516-522; AJ. Kaumann et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives Pharmacol, 1994, 349(4), 331-337; and compare with the very recent paper of J.B. Crammer et al., Basic Res. Cardiol. (Germany), 2001, 96(1), 82-90, published after the priority date of the present application.<br>
WO 93/18036 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses a large number of condensed indole compounds as 5-HT4 antagonists including, as Exzmple 3 on pages 17-18, N-[(l-%utyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]oxazino[3,2-a]indole-10-carboxamide (SB 207266) and its preferred hydrochloride salt (SB 207266-A). These compounds are disclosed for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and CNS disorders, in particular irritable bowel syndrome. WO 93/18036 also states in the general description on pp.6-7 in general terms that: "Specific cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists which prevent atrial fibrillation and other atrial arrhythmias associated with 5-HT would also be expected to reduce the occurrence of stroke". See also US 5,852,014, EP 0 884 319 A2, L.M. Gaster et al, J. Med. Chem., 1995, 38,4760-4763 and Drugs of the Future, 1997, 22(12), 1325-1332 for the compound SB 207266, which is highly selective for the 5HT4 receptor over other 5HT receptors. (The potency and selectivity of SB207266 is also shown by the 5HT4 receptor antagonist and selectivity test results presented later in the present patent application). Far improved syntheses of SB 207266, see WO 98/07728, WO 98/11067; WO 00/03983; and WO 00/03984.<br>
The structure of SB 207266 is as follows:<br>

Other 5HT4 antagonists are disclosed in WO 94/27965 (Syntex) and one of these compounds RS 100302 (Roche), whose name is N-(2-(4-(3-(8-amino-7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl)-3-oxopropyl)piperidin-1 -yl)ethyl)-methanesulfonamide, has been suggested to be effective in treating pig models of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation (M.M. Rahme et al., Circulation, 1999, vol. 100(19), pp. 2010-2017). In the Rahme paper, it is noted that in the protocol on page 2011, AF or AFL was triggered in pigs by a short (60sec) run of rapid atrial pacing without any other preparation; when AF was not induced a crush injury was made to the right atrial free wall. It is further noted that the 60 sec pacing protocol in Rahme would not have been sufficient to induce atrial remodelling, which needs several hours or days to occur depending on the mammalian species. Rapid atrial pacing, for initial sensitization, needs to be performed for about 3 to 4 hours to generate remodelling of the tissue, as described by A. Goette et al., 1996, Circulation, 94, 2968-2974, and/or as shown in the experiments shown in Examples 1 and 2 hereinafter. Similarly, the atrial crush injury disclosed in Rahme may generate physically reentrant circuits but will not generate remodelling. Rahme therefore does not disclose the use of a 5-HT4 antagonist for the treatment of atrial remodelling.<br>
Other 5HT4 antagonists are disclosed in: RD Clark et al Bioorg Med Chem Lett 1994, 4(20), 2481-4; Clark, ibid, 1995, 5(18), 2119 2122 (e.g. RS100235).<br>
WO 93/05038 (SmithKline Beecham) discloses a series of 5HT4 antagonists, including in Example 1 the highly active and selective 5HT4 antagonist SB 204070 which is (l-butyl-4-piperidyl)methyl 8-amino-7~chl:&gt;ro-l,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylate. For the hydrochloride salt of this compound (SB 204070-A) see L.M. Gaster et al, J. Med. Chem, 1993, 36, 4121-4123. Cither 5HT4 antagonists disclosed in WO 93/05038 include: SB 207710 [(l-butyl-4-piperidyl)methyl 8-amino-7-iodo-1,4~ben7,odioxan-5-carboxylate] and its hydrochloride as shown in Example 52; and<br>

It is desirable to discover new compounds, or classes of compounds, which can be used in the therapy (e.g. treatment or prophylaxis) of atrial remodelling.<br>
Rapid atrial rates and/or atrial pacing, especially dxonic rapid atrial rates or chronic atrial pacing (e.g. atrial pacing in an animal experimental setting), is a situation in which atrial remodelling (especially electrical remodelling) occurs in which the Atrial Effective Refractory Period (AERP) is reduced. Experimentally, such electrical remodelling is shown to play a significant role in facilitating occurrence of AK We have now discovered that 5-HT4 receptor antagonists (inhibitors), especially SB 207266, are capable of at least partly reversing this reduction in Atrial Effective Refractory Period (AERP), i.e. are capable of increasing the AERP. Therefore, it is expected that 5-HT4 receptor antagonists like SB 207266 will mitigate atrial remodelling and/or protect the atria from remodelling, in particular electrical remodelling.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling, for example in a mammal such as a human.<br>
The invention also provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of atrial remodelling, in a mammal (e.g. human) in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist.<br>
The invention also provides a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling, for example in a mzmmal such as a human.<br>
Preferably, the invention involves the prophylaxis or treatment of electrophysiological (electrical) atrial remodelling, as defined above.   More" preferably, the invention involves the prophylaxis or treatment of electrical (electrophysiological) atrial remodelling, e.g. in the mammal, by increasing the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and/or by at least partly protecting from or reversing a reduction in the AERP.<br>
The invention, in all its aspects, can involve the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling potentiated by atrial fibrillation, for example atrial remodelling potentiated by recurrent atrial fibrillation. In all aspects of the invention, the mammal (e.g. human) treated can be a sufferer of or susceptible to atrial fibrillation, especially a sufferer [e.g. long-term (e.g. &gt;l-year or &gt;5-year or &gt; 48 hrs and  48 hrs and l-year or &gt;5-year) sufferers of persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation are more likely to have atrial<br>
remodelling problems, as discussed above. Alternatively, the mammal (e.g. human) can be a sufferer of or susceptible to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.<br>
Preferably or alternatively, in all aspects of the invention, the medicament / method of treatment or prophylaxis / 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (e.g. SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is for, of, or for use in the inhibition (e.g. prevention) of symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in a mammal (e.g. in a human / in patients) with paroxysmal or persistent AF (preferably persistent AF). [The invention therefore also provides the use of a 5-Hl'4 receptor antagonist in the manufacture of a medicament for the inhibition of symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in a mammal with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation; and/or a method of inhibiting symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in a mammal with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation, which comprises administering to said mammal an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist.]<br>
Paroxysmal, persistent and permanent AF are terms defining the severity of the AF and are understood by the skilled person.<br>
"Paroxysmal AF" includes or means episode(s) of AF with a mean duration of individual episodes of 
"Persistent AF", e.g. symptomatic persistent AF, is usually longer in duration than paroxysmal AF, and includes or means episode(s), e.g. symptomatic episodes, of AF with a mean duration of individual episodes of &gt; 48 hrs and  48 hrs and 
"Permanent AF" includes or means episode(s) of AF with a mean duration of individual episodes longer than that of persistent AF, e.g. &gt;l-year or &gt;5-year duration, or of permanent duration. It does not usually respond to electrical cardioversion and is associated with a profound electrical remodelling and is usually accompanied with underlying CV disease (ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and/or hypertension, etc).<br>
Optionally, in any aspects of the invention, the invention can involve the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling potentiated by a rapid atrial rate (atrial pacing) (e.g. experimental chronic atrial pacing). The mammal (e.g. human) treated can be a sufferer of or susceptible to a rapid atrial rate (atrial pacing), e.g. an abnormally rapid atrial rate.<br>
The 5-HT4 receptor antagonists used in any of the aspects of the invention can include any of those referred to in the introduction. Thus, for example, the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists used in the invention can include any compound covered by any of the claims (e.g. claim 1 et al.) of any of the patent publications referred to in the introduction as disclosing 5-HT4 receptor antagonists (e.g. WO 93/18036, WO 93/05038, WO 93/16072; WO 94/10174; WO 94/27987; WO 95/04737; WO 93/20071, EP 501322 Bl, WO 94/27965, and/or EP 732333 Al), and/or for example can include any 5-HT4 receptor antagonist specifically exemplified in any publication (e.g. patent or journal publication) referred to in the introduction as disclosing 5-HT4 receptor antagonist(s). As mentioned below, all publications cited in this specification, including but not limited to these 5-Hl'4 receptor antagonist publications, are herein incorporated by reference as if each individual publication were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.<br>
Other 5-HT4 receptor antagonists not mentioned herein can be found using the 5-HT4 antagonist test(s) detailed hereinafter.<br>
Pharrnaceutically acceptable salts (e.g. HC1 salts), r.olvates, hydrates, complexes and/or prodrugs of 5-HT4 receptor antagonists and similar derivatives are included within the scope of the definition of "5-HT4 receptor antagonist(s)".   Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent \:o those skilled in the art and include for example acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids eg. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids eg. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid.<br>
The 5-HT4 receptor antagonist is preferably an antagonist of the 5-HT4A and/or 5-HT4jj receptors. The 5-HT^^ receptor can be as characterised in O. Blondel et al, FEES Letters, 412, 1997, pp. 465-474. The 5-HT4B receptor can be as characterised in O. Blondel et al, J. Neurochem., 1998, 70(6), pp. 2253-2261 and/or in WO 99/28456 (INSERM). Other splice variants of the 5-HT4 receptor include 5-and 5-HT4£&gt;, as disclosed for example in WO 99/28456.<br>
Preferably, the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist is a cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, meaning an antagonist of those 5-HT4 receptors present in the human atrium, preferably meaning an antagonist of those 5-HT4 receptors which in the human<br>
heart are substantially only present in the human atrium. (See e.g. Kaumann et al., Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol (1990), 342: 619-622; A.J. Kaumann et al., Br J Pharmacol (1990) 100: 879-885, O. Blondel et al, FEBS Letters, 412, 1997, pp. 465-474; O. Blondel et al, J. Neurochem., 199?,, 70(6), pp. 2253-2261; and WO 99/28456). The 5-HT4A and the 5-HT4g receptors are such receptors.<br>
In fact, it has now been found by the inventors that the 5-HT4g receptor is the principal 5-HT4 receptor isoform expressed in human atria. Smaller amounts of the 5-HT4A and 5HT4C receptor isoforms are found in human atria but 5-HT4J) is not detectable. Also, preliminary data suggest that there is a substantial increase in 5-HT4g receptor expression in the atria of human patients with chronic (persistent) AF compared to the atria of human patients with acute (paroxysmal) AF. Also, SB 207266 has been found to be a 5-HT4g antagonist. [Therefore, the invention also provides (A) the use of a 5-HT4jj receptor antagonist in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling and/or atrial arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation) in a human who is a sufferer of or susceptible to persistent atrial fibrillation; (B) a method of treatment or prophylaxis of atrial remodelling and/or atrial arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation), in a human in need thereof who is a sufferer of or susceptible to persistent atrial fibrillation, which comprises administering to said human an effective amount of a 5-HT4JJ receptor antagonist; and/or (C) a S-fflfyg receptor antagonist for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling and/or atrial arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation) in a human who is a sufferer of or susceptible to persistent atrial fibrillation. Preferably, the antagonist is an antagonist of the human (e.g. atrial) 5-HT4g receptor.]<br>
Preferably, in any of the aspects of the invention, the 5-HT4 (e.g. 5-HT4A and/or 5-HT4B) receptor antagonist is a selective 5-HT4 (e.g. 5-HT4A and/or S-fffyg) receptor antagonist. Such an antagonist may for example bind to and/or inhibit the 5-HT4 (e.g. 5-HT4A and/or S-OT^g) receptor at least 10 times, preferably at least 25 times, more preferably at least 100 times, more strongly than any other 5-HT receptor.  The selectivity can be measured by known tests. See e.g. See D Hoyer, Neuropharmacology, 1997, 36(4/5), 419 and refs cited therein for 5-HT receptor nomenclature.<br>
Preferably, the 5-HT4 (e.g. 5-HT4A and/or 5-HT4jj) receptor antagonist comprises a compound disclosed in the description (including the the Examples) and/or the claims of WO 93/18036. For example, in accordance with claim 1 of WO 93/18036, the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist can comprise a compound of formula (I), or a pharrnaceutically acceptable salt thereof<br>

Pharmaceutical compositions (formulations)<br>
In order to use 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, they will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
5-HT4 receptor antagonists (or "inhibitors") may conveniently be administered by any of the routes conventionally used for drug administration, for instance, parenterally, orally, topically or by inhalation. 5-HT4 receptor antagonists may be administered in conventional dosage forms prepared by combining it with standard pharmaceutically acceptable carriers according to conventional procedures. 5-HT4 receptor antagonists may also be administered in conventional dosages in combination with a known, second therapeutically active compound. These procedures may involve mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation. It will be appreciated that the<br>
form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition, for example for use in any of the methods/uses of the invention, comprising a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (e.g. comprising or being SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier employed may be, for example, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include time delay material well known to the art, such as glyceryl mono-stearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax.<br>
A wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 25mg to about Ig. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation will be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampoule or nonaqueous liquid suspension.<br>
Two particularly preferred oral compositions for SB 207266, for human oral administration, are as follows:<br>
SB-207266	5.0 mg<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose	30.0 mg<br>
Mannitol	112.0mg<br>

The dose in the second (right-hand) composition can readily be increased to 20 mg. The second composition is the result of a granulation process.<br>
These and other suitable oral compositions for SB 207266 are described in Examples 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 hereinbelow.<br>
Dosage regimens and routes and methods of administration<br>
5-HT4 receptor antagonists ("inhibitors") ?re preferably administered parenterally, that is by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal or intraperitoneal administration. The; intravenous form of parenteral administration is generally preferred. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration may be prepared by conventional techniques.<br>
5-HT4 receptor antagonists ("inhibitors") may also be administered orally. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration may be prepared by conventional techniques.<br>
5-Hl'4 receptor antagonists may also be administered by inhalation, that is by intranasal and oral inhalation administration. Appropriate dosage forms for such administration, such as aerosol formulations, may be prepared by conventional techniques.<br>
5-HT4 receptor antagonists may also be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream.<br>
For all methods of use disclosed herein for 5-HT4 receptor antagonists ("inhibitors") such as SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, the daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from about 3.1 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.2 to 30 mg/kg, mo::e preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to 15mg/kg. The daily parenteral (e.g. intravenous) dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.1 to about 80 mg/kg of total body weight, preferably from about 0.2 to about 30 mg/kg, and more preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg 1:0 15mg/kg. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 mg to 150 mg, administered one to four, preferably two or three times daily. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg per day.<br>
Based on the above preferred dosage ranges and based on the in vivo results of in minipigs experiments shown in the Examples 1 and 2 hereinbelow, where doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg of SB-207266 administered intravenously were effective to treat atrial fibrillation and atrial remodelling, the following dosage ranges are preferred for prophylaxis or treatment of atrial arrhythmia (e.g. atrial fibrillation and/or atrial remodelling) comprising administering SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The daily oral or parenteral (e.g. intravenous) dosage regimen will preferably be from about 0.1 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg of total body weight (e.g. 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg), more preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg (e.g. 0.2 to 1.0 mg/kg), still more preferably from 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg, and<br>
most preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/k£ (e.g. 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg), especially in a mammal such as a human. Alternatively, the daily oral or parenteral dosage regimen can be from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg of total body weight, for example from about 0.2 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg of total body weight. For a human, for example weighing around 70-75 kg, a daily oral or parenteral (e.g. intravenous) dosage regimen of 0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg corresponds to approximately from (21-22.5) to (70-75) mg daily; about 0.2 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg corresponds to from (about 14-15) to (70-75) mg daily; about 0.5 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg corresponds to from (about 35-37.5) to (70-75) mg daily; about 0.2 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg corresponds to from (about 14-15) to (about 35-37.5) mg daily; about 0.2 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg corresponds to from (about 14-15) to (21-22.5) mg daily.<br>
Preferred daily doses for human oral or paronteral (e.g. intravenous) administration are:<br>
a)	5-20 mg (e.g. as in the second specific oral composition of SB 207266 given above)<br>
and in particular 20 mg,<br>
b)	50 mg<br>
c)	80 mg.<br>
Doses are measured as the weight of the SB 207266 free base, so that for salts of SB 207266 the weight of any acid(s) added to the free base to form the salt is excluded.<br>
Therefore, a fifth aspect of the invention provides the use of N-[(l-nbutyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]oxazino[3,2-a]indole-10-carboxamide(SB 207266) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation in a mammal (e.g. human) by administering to the mammal a daily oral or parenteral dosage regimen of about 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg of the SB 207266 or salt thereof per kg of total body weight (measured as the free base).<br>

The 20, 50 and/or 80 mg human daily oral or parenteral doses and the about 0.2 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily doses are designed to minimise or reduce cardiovascular<br>
and/or other side-effects of administration of SB 207266. Preliminary studies indicate that human daily oral doses of about 120 nig or more of SB 207266 (corresponding to about 1.6 to 1.7 mg/kg/day or more in a mammal) might give rise to certain side-effects, and so preferably such high doses of SB 207266 should be avoided.<br>
Therefore, it is preferable that the daily oral or paronteral dosage regimen is preferably less than about 1.5 mg of SB 207266 or salt per kg of total body weight, more preferably about 0.2 mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg, still more preferably from about 0.5 to about 1.5 mg/kg, for example about 1.0 mg/kg to about 1.5 mg/kg (e.g. 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg or 1.0 to 1.3 mg/kg), all measured as the free base. Therefore, the invention also provides: (A) the use of SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation in a mammal (e.g. human) by administering to the mammal a daily oral or parenteral dosage regimen of about 1.0 mg to about 1.5 mg (e.g. 1.0 to 1.5 mg or 1.0 to 1.3 mg) of the SB 207266 or salt there of per kg of total body weight; (B) a method of treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to said mammal a daily oral or parenteral dosage regimen of about 1.0 mg to about 1.5 mg of SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof per kg of total body weight; and/or (C) SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation in a mammal (e.g. human) by administering to the mammal a daily oral or parenteral dosage regimen of about 1.0 mg to about 1.5 mg of the SB 207266 or salt thereof per kg of total body weight; all weight being measured as the free base.<br>
Preferably, in all aspects of the invention, the medicament / method of treatment or prophylaxis / 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (e.g. SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is for use in the inhibition of symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal or peisistent AF (preferably persistent AF).<br>
A preferred protocol for the inhibition of symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation using SB 207266 in patients with persistent AF is described in detail in Example 3 hereinafter.<br>
Loading dose<br>
With use/administration of SB 207266, it is usually desirable to achieve the full therapeutic response more promptly. In order to achieve this, it is believed that an<br>
initial larger "loading dose" (e.g. oral dose) of SB 207266 or a salt thereof can be employed to reach therapeutic concentrations more rapidly.<br>
It has been found that steady-state plasma concentrations of SB 207266 are reached only after approximately 4 to 5 days of once daily closing (the concentration on day 4 has been found to be about 90% of the steady-state plasma concentration). The elimination half-life Tl/2 was found to be about 20-24 hours. It is believed that such a prolonged duration to achieve steady-state concentration is undesirable since patients with atrial fibrillation /remodelling who have been converted (cardioverted) to normal sinus rhythm following an episode of AF are more likely to have recurrences of AF soon after cardioversion. It is believed that the extent of accumulation following once daily oral dosing is approximately 1.5-fold. Therefore, the administration of approximately 1.5 times the daily dose (a "loading dose") on Day 1 of administration of SB 207266 should resul: in attainment of pseudo steady-state plasma concentrations sooner. For example (without being bound by theory) 90% of the steady-state plasma concentration is thought to be achievable after about 24 hours or less of administering the loading dose, based in part on the modelling shown below. This should have a therapeutic benefit for an AF patient after cardioversion, e.g. by allowing earlier cardioversion after first dosing and/or by decreasing the chances of the patient reverting back to fibrillation soon after cardioversion and/or by decreasing hospitalisation time for the patient.<br>
Preliminary population pharmacokinetic modelling has resulted in Figure 5 which shows simulated SB-207266 plasma concentration vs time profiles for two regimens (120 mg on day 1 followed by 80 mg once daily for 7 days versus 80 mg once daily for 8 days). The simulations in Figure 5 indicate that following a loading regimen of 1.5 times the maintainance dose, steady-state conditions are achieved more rapidly by 24 hours thereby reducing the telemetry monitoring period for each patient while still maintaining the maximum SB-207266 plasma concentrations within 10% of the target steady-state. The potential reduction of the telemetry monitoring period with a loading regimen would allow for an earlier patient discharge from an in-hospital treatment, with associated benefits in medical cost and convenience to the patient.<br>
For these reasons, preferably SB 207266 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered on the first day at a loading dose of about 1.2 to about 2.0 times (preferably about 1.25 to about 1.75 times, e.g. about 1.5 times) the daily maintainance dose and then is administered at the maintainance daily dose on subsequent days.<br>
Therefore, in all aspects of the invention, the medicament, method or antagonist is for or employs administration of the SB 207266 or salt thereof on the first day at a<br>
loading dose of about 1.2 to about 2.0 times the daily maintenance dose, followed by administration of the SB 207266 or salt at the maintainance daily dose on subsequent days. Preferably, the loading dose is about 1.25 to about 1.75 times the daily maintainance dose, more preferably about 1.5 times the daily maintainance dose. Preferably, the daily maintenance dose comprises the daily oral or parenteral dosage or dosage regimen as defined in the fifth and/or sixth aspects of the invention.<br>
Additionally, according to a seventh aspect of the invention there is provided the use of N-t(l-nbutyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]oxazino[3,2-ajindole-10-carboxamide (SB 207266) or a pharme.ceutically acceptable salt thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial arrhythmia (e.g. comprising atrial remodelling and/or atrial fibrillation) in a mammal (e.g. human) by administration of the SB 207266 or salt thereof on the first day at a loading dose of about 1.2 to about 2.0 times the daily maintainance dose, followed by administration of the SB 207266 or salt at the daily maintainance dose on subsequent days.<br>

the method comprising administering the SB 207266 or salt thereof on the first day at a loading dose of about 1.2 to about 2.0 times the daily maintainance dose, and on subsequent days administering the SB 207266 or salt at the daily maintainance dose.<br>
The seventh aspect of the invention also provides N-[(l-nbutyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]oxazino[3,2-a]indole-10-carboxamide(SB 207266) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial arrhythmia (e.g. comprising atrial remodelling and/or atrial fibrillation) in a mammal (e.g. human) by administiation of the SB 207266 or salt thereof on the first day at a loading dose of about 1.2 to about 2.0 times the daily maintainance dose, followed by administration of the SB 207266 or salt at the daily maintainance dose on subsequent days.<br>

The 20mg, 50 mg or 80 mg doses/dosages can be according to the fifth and/or sixth aspects of the invention, so for example can be human daily oral or parenteral doses/dosages. See the Protocol in Example 3 hereinafter for an example of these doses and how they can be used.<br>
Preferably, the loading dose is 
In all aspects of the invention, the daily maintenance dose can be given for a period clinically desirable in the patient, for example from 1 day up to several years (e.g. for the mammal's entire remaining life); for example from about (2 or 3 or 5 days, 1 or 2 weeks, or 1 month) upwards and/or for example up to about (5 years, 1 year, 6 months, 1 month, 1 week, or 3 or 5 days).

Preferably, the loading dose is administered during an arrhythmic (e.g. atrial fibrillatory) episode in the mammal, and if the mammal is not in normal sinus rhythm after a period sufficient for the loading dose to take effect then the mammal is cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm before administration of the maintenance dose. Therefore, preferably, the use, a m6thod, a compound or an antagonist of the invention is for or employs administration of the loading dose during an arrhythmic (e.g. atrial fibrillatory) episode in the mammal, and which is for or employs administration of the maintenance dose after cardioversion of the mammal back to normal sinus rhythm in the event that the mammal is not in normal sinus rhythm after a period sufficient for the loading dose to take effect.

SB 207266 - N-[(l-nbutyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2H-[l,3]oxazino[3,2-a]indole-10-carboxamide - is made using the synthetic methods decribed in the introduction, i.e. as described in one or more of WO 93/18036; WO 98/07728, WO 98/11067; WO 00/03983; and WO 00/03984.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 - Experimental atrial fibrillation / atrial remodelling test results with SB-207266<br>
The antiarrhythrnic efficacy of SB-207266 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, intravenous) was evaluated on the inducibility of AF in a model of 5 -HT-induced atrial arrhythmia in anesthetized Yucatan minipigs. As shown in Figure 1, prior to AF induction, animals were sensitized by 3 hours of rapid atrial pacing (200 msec cycle length) and concomitant topical application of 5-HT (4 mg/h) at the atrial stimulation site. The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) and AF inducibility were determined during programmed stimulation and burst electrical pacing.<br>
In both vehicle- and drug-treated groups, rapid atrial pacing and application of 5-HT caused a reduction of AERP from 111.6 ± 2.6 to 90.9 ±2.1 msec, before application of the vehicle or drug - see black diamonds (*) in Figure 1 and left-hand bar graph in Figure 2. A smaller reduction of AERP was seen when 5-HT was added without<br>
atrial pacing - see white diamonds (0) in Figure 1. As shown in the right hand bar graphs in Figures 2 and 3, the pre-drug AF inducibility (% incidence of AF) caused by 10 successive bursts of pacing (2 sec-burst at 20 msec cycle length) was stable and reproducible (76±8, 69±7, 73±4%, n=7 in vehicle group, Figure 2).<br>
As shown in Figure 3, application of SB-207266 after the atrial pacing and application of 5-HT caused a dose-dependent increase in AERP from 90.0 ± 2.7 to 102.3 ± 2.7 and 110.0 ± 3.6 msec, respectively at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg (p
These results suggest that SB-207266 has effective properties in the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling (or AF) caused by rapid atrial pacing, associated with selective prolongation of atrial refractoriness (lengthening of the AERP).<br>

Animals.   Male Yucatan minipigs (12-17 kg weight) were obtained from Charles River (Saint-Aubin les Elboeuf, France) and were maintained at rest over a 2-week acclimatision period prior to experiments.<br>
Surgical Preparation of Animals. The minipigs (Charles River, France) were fasted and premedicated (2 mg/kg diazepam + 15 mg/kg ketamine, i.m.) before induction of anesthesia by isoflurane inhalation (5% for induction followed by 0.5 to 1.5% for technical preparation) in a mixture of 25% C&gt;2 and 75% N2O. The long term anesthesia was maintained with an i.v. infusion of sodium pentobarbital (12 mg/kg/h). A mechanical ventilator (Harvard pump 613) was used to provide artificial respiration during the left thoracotomy in order to keep arterial blood gases and pH within the normal limits (ABL 500 analyzer). Fluid filled catheters were placed in the femoral artery and vein to measure the arterial pressure (P23 ID transducer) and for drug administrations, respectively. Leads n, in and a precordial lead of electrocardiogram were placed for monitoring of standard ECG parameters. Two pairs of electrodes were hooked to the left atiial wall for subsequent stimulation (S8800 stimulator and SIU-5 unit) and for measurement of an atrial electrogram.<br>
Example 2 - Experimental Procedures<br>
Sensitization of the Atrial Tissue. The left atrial appendage was sensitized by rapid atrial pacing (200 ms cycle length over 3 hours) to generate an initial electrical remodelling of the tissue [A. Goette et al., 1996, Circulation, 94, 2968-2974]. Then, a solution of 5-HT (serotonin) (4 mg/h, starting 30 min before end of atrial pacing) was applied locally using a cellulose patch placed close to the stimulating electrodes, and this 5-HT application was maintair.ed until the end of the experiment. The cellulose patch retains the 5-HT ;n contact with the tissue. After this period of sensitization and under constant topical application of 5-HT, baseline atrial refractoriness and inducibility of AF were determined (see the cross-hatched area in Figure 1, cross-hatched "pre-drug" bar graphs in Figures 2 and 3, and shaded box from -90 mins to 0 mins in Figure 4A).<br>
Electrophysiologic Study. The atrial effective refractory period (AERP) was determined using a conventional single extrastimulus technique as previously described [A. Bril, B. Gout et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 276, 637-646.] . Briefly, a 8-stimulus train at a basic cycle length 20% shorter than the sinus rhythm was followed by a single premature extrastimulus (4 ms, 1.5 times threshold current) introduced at progressively shorter coupling intends from the atrial pacing until no atrial response was obtained. The AERP represents the longest coupling interval which failed to induce a propagated response in the tissue.<br>
After determination of AERP, the atrial fibrillation (AF) challenge was started. AF was induced following atrial pacing by a 2 sec-burst of stimulation (basic cycle length 20 ms cycle length, 2 ms duration, twice the diastolic threshold)<br>
introduced within the vulnerable window (AERP -r 10 ms). AF was defined as at least 1 sec of irregular electrical activity measured on atrial electrogram.<br>
Study Design and Dosing. After assessment of reproducible baseline responses of animals (3 successive AF challenges), the minipigfi were randomly assigned to receive either sterile distilled water (vehicle group, n=7), or escalating doses of SB-207266 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, n=7) given i.v. over a 10 min period 15 min before determination of AERP and subsequent AF challenge. SB-207266 was dissolved in sterile distilled water and adequate drug solutions were prepared every day. Treatment with vehicle represented a volume of distilled water similar to that used for drug solution (10 ml). Each dose of SB-207266 was administered at 45 min intervals to allow recovery of animals from previous burst pacing challenge. Brief schemes indicating the main time points of the protocol are presented in Figures 1 and 4A.<br>
Evaluation of Plasma Concentration of SB-207266. For each AF challenge, blood samples were collected on EDTA (6%) 5 min after the end of the bolus administration of drug (time point 15 min, see asterisks in Figure 4A) and centrifuged (1500 x g, 10 min at 4°C). The plasma samples were stored at -80°C for subsequent analysis. Plasma samples were not collected in the vehicle group. The determination of plasma concentration of SB-207266 was performed by LC/MS/MS with a LLQ for this assay of 5 ng/ml in the pig.<br>
Example 2 - Data Handling &amp; Analysis<br>
Measurements and Calculations. All parameters were monitored on a chart paper polyrecorder (TA-5000) and digital recording was performed throughout the protocol (DTR 1800). When measured, heart rate was calculated from the ECG and the mean arterial blood pressure was calculated from the pulse pressure. A corrected QT was determined according to the Bazett's formula (QTc = QT (ms) / RR (sec) 1/2). AF inducibility was expressed as a percentage of responses obtained from 10 successive bursts and the mean duration of AF episodes recorded during the sequence of 10 burst stimulations was expressed in seconds.<br>
Statistical Analysis. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Newman-Keuls test for multiple pairwise comparisons. The drug effects were measured using ANOVA for repeated measures. The inducibility of AF in response to burst stimulation was analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. All .statistics were performed using the Statistica 5.1 release Package (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).<br>
Example 2 - Results<br>
5-HT-Induced Atrial Fibrillation in Minipig.   In this model, application of rapid atrial pacing during 3 hours prior to topical application of 5-HT was necessary to generate enough electrical remodelling in the atrial tissue to favour the occurrence of AF in response to burst stimulation. For this purpose, the effects of various interventions, including rapid atrial pacing alone, 5-HT alone and the combination of both pacing and 5-HT were studied on the changes in AERP. After 3 hours of rapid atrial pacing (200 ms basic cycle length) the AERP was significantly decreased from 110.7 ± 4.6 ms to 93.6 ± 3.6 ms (n = 7; p 
Effect ofSB-207266 on 5-HT-Induced AF.   Intravenous administration of increasing doses of SB-207266 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) in sensitized pigs induced a dose-dependent increase in AERP from a predrug value of 90 ± 3 ms to 102 ± 3 and 110 ± 4 ms at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively (p 
Plasma concentrations of SB-207266. The circulating concentration of SB-207266 was measured in plasma samples collected 5 min after the end of each bolus dose of SB-207266. The plasma level of SB-207266 observed with 0.3 mg/kg SB-207266 was 137.7 ± 15.2 ng/ml (n = 6) and reached 562.3 ± 40.1 ng/ml at 1.0 mg/kg (n = 5).<br>

Example 2 — Discussion<br>
The results of the present study show that 5-HT exhibits a minimal effect on AERP compared to rapid atrial pacing. In the goat it has been shown that at the time of rapid atrial pacing initiation AERP decreased after 6 hours (physiological rate adaptation) and that this reduction was further observed with time [M.C.E.F. Wijffels et al., Circulation, 1997, 96, 3710-3720] . Our results show that 3 hours of rapid atrial pacing in minipigs is sufficient to obtain a stable reduction of AERP which characterises the electrical remodelling. In addition our results show that the application of 5-HT either alone or in the presence of rapid atrial pacing marginally changed the AERP. This suggests that 5-HT may not be directly involved in the electrophysiological mechanisms leading to AF but might rather play a facilitating role in AF.<br>
Although 5-HT induced a minimal effect on AERP and AF incidence, the i.v. administration of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, SES-207266, prevents/inhibits (or reverses) the AERP reduction and protects from AF inducibility in a dose-dependent manner.   These results are shown to be related to the plasma concentration of the drug . These results suggest that inhibition (antagonism) of the 5-HT4 receptor, for example by administering SB-207266, appears to lead to atrial antifibrillatory effects.<br>
Example 2 - Conclusions<br>
SB-207266 was shown to reverse significantly the reduction of AERP caused by combined rapid atrial pacing and topical application of 5-HT and to reduce significantly the incidence of AF episodes.   These results suggest that SB-207266 and 5HT4 receptor antagonists in general may be effective at reducing/treating atrial fibrillation, associated with a restoration (increase) of the atrial ERP characterizing a reversal of the atrial electrical remodelling observed in the presence of 5-HT and atrial pacing.<br>
The results with SB-207266 described in Example 2 (and also in Example 1), appear to illustrate a novel approach for the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial remodelling and/or atrial arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, by administration/use of a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist such as any of the compounds described herein.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 - Protocol for the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial remodelling in humans using orally administered SB 207266<br>
A currently preferred protocol for the treatment or prophylaxis of atrial remodelling and/or atrial fibrillation using SB 207266 or a salt thereof is now described in detail.<br>
This Protocol describes administration of SB 207266 or the salt (hereinafter "SB 207266") to patients with symptomatic persistent ktrial fibrillation (AF). The objective is the inhibition of symptomatic recurrences of atrial fibrillation in these patients with persistent AF. Patients with symptomatic persistent AF, of duration &gt; 48 hrs and 
•	therapeutic anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin) for &gt; 3 weeks before commencement<br>
of treatment, or<br>
•	in the absence of therapeutic anticoagulation for &gt; 3 weeks, they have a<br>
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) which is negative for clot and have<br>
received intravenous heparin until aPTT is stable and in the therapeutic range.<br>
Patients receive SB 207266 preferably after such therapeutic anticoagulation, or after TEE in addition to iv heparin.<br>
SB 207266 (e.g. as free base, but more preferably £.s the hydrochloride salt SB 207266-A) is generally administered at daily oral doses of 20mg, 50 mg or 80 mg uid (measured as the free base).   However, on day 1 of the administration of SB 207266, it is generally administered at a single oral loading dose of 1.5 times (1.5 x) the dosage allocated for the daily maintenance therapy.   Therefore, preferably, a single oral loading dose of 30 mg, 75mg or 120 mg is given on day 1, followed by a daily dose of 20mg, 50 mg or 80 mg respectively on subsequent days.<br>
About two hours after administration of the first-day 1.5x oral loading dose of SB 207266, patients remaining in atrial fibrillation (and/or not pharmacologically cardioverted) preferably then undergo direct current (DC) cardioversion. Either of the following mono or bi-phasic cardioversion algorithms can be followed.<br><br>

If the patient does not revert to normal sinus rhython (NSR) after the 3rd shock using one of the above sequences the doctor may at his discretion proceed with further attempts at different energies. Successful cmdioversion is defined as maintenance of NSR for &gt; 1 hr.<br>
Following a successful DC cardioversion to NSR, administration of SB 207266 to the patient can be continued once daily for 6 months (for example), or for shorter or longer periods. Those patients who spontaneously revert to normal sinus rhythmn (NSR) can also receive SB 207266 once daily for (e.g.) 6 months. Patients who experience a recurrence of AF during this daily treatment can be DC cardioverted back to sinus rhythm and can continue to receive SB 207266.<br>
Patients should preferably continue on anticoagulation therapy (e.g. warfarin) throughout the period during which SB 207266 is administered.<br>
The most preferred Protocol is therefore given below:<br>
A "symptomatic recurrence" of AF includes or means an episode of palpitations or other symptoms typical for the patient. This can be further established by either a ECG (e.g. 12-lead ECG) recording showing evidence of atrial fibrillation or a rhythm strip recorded on a event recorder device and optionally reviewed by the doctor.<br>

The tablet of Example 5 can be varied by increasing the dose of SB 207266 from 5 mg to up to 20, 60 or 80 mg (measured as the free base), ind by decreasing the amount of dicalcium phosphate accordingly while keeping the 250 mg tablet weight constant.<br>
Example 7 - SB-207266-A Tablets with 10,25, and 40mg strength (measured as pure free base)<br>
Tablets containing the hydrochloride salt of SB 207266 (SB 207266-A) in amounts of 10, 25 or 40 mg (measured as the free base) were made according to the composition in the table below. These tablets were designed to be used in the treatment Protocol<br>
described in Example 3, using two of the tablets a day for a total daily dose of 20, 50 and 80 mg respectively as called for in the Protocol.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
* Equivalent to 10, 25,40mg respectively of pure free base ** Removed during processing<br>
The SB-207266-A tablets of Example 7 are packed into high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with plastic, child-resistant, induction seal caps.<br>
The formulation used a wet granulation process using an insoluble major excipient, Dibasic calcium Phosphate dihydrate (or Dicalcium phosphate).  Dibasic calcium Phosphate dihydrate is the major diluent together with microcrystalline cellulose which is added to disperse the granulating solvent and to aid in the overall<br>
compressibility. The binding agent added is hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and the granulation is carried out in a conventional mixer granulator. The granule mix is dried, screened and mixed with sodium starch glye;ollate as a disintegrant and magnesium stearate as a lubricant to form the compression mix. Tablets are produced on a suitable rotary tablet press, and can be either oval or round in shape.<br>
Example 7 - Detailed Manufacturing Process, In-process Controls, and Assembly Process<br>
SB-207266-A, microcrystalline cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose are blended together.

TESTS FOR 5-HT4 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST ACTIVITY AND ACTIVITY OF SB 207266<br>
1)        Guinea pig colon<br>
This animal model is described by Wardle KA and Sanger GJ (1993), Br J Pharmacol; 110 1593-1599.<br>
Male guinea-pigs, weighing 250-400g are used. Longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations, approximately 3cm long, are obtained from the distal colon region. These are suspended under a 0.5g load in isolated tissue baths containing Krebs solution bubbled with 5% CO2 in C&gt;2 and maintained at 37°C. In all experiments, the Krebs solution also contains msthiothepin 10~7M and granisetron 10-6M to block effects at 5-HTi, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors.<br>
After construction of a simple concentration-response curve with 5-HT, using 30s contact times and a 15min dosing cycle, a concentration of 5-HT is selected so as to obtain a contraction of the muscle approximately 40-70% maximum(10~9M approx). The tissue is then dosed every 15min with this concentration of 5-HT. In some experiments, this tissue was dosed alternately with an approximately equi-effective concentration of the nicotine receptor stimulant, dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP). After obtaining consistent responses to 5-HT (and when appropriate, DMPP), increasing concentrations of a putative 5-HT4 receptor antagonist are then added to the bathing solution. The effects of this compound are then determined as a percentage reduction of the contractions evoked by 5-HT or by DMPP. From this data, pIC5Q values are determined, being defined as the -log concentration of antagonist which reduces the contraction by 50%. A compound which reduces the response to 5-HT but not to DMPP is believed to act as a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist.<br>
SB 207266 had a particularly good activity.<br>
In the presence of 5-HTi, 5-HT2 and 5-Hl'3 receptor antagonists, 5-HT produces a monophasic cholinergically-mediated contraction, characterised by a pEC5Q of 9-2 ± °'06 (n=14). Increasing concentrations of SB-207266-A, (the HC1 salt of SB207266) (lO"10 - 1Q-8M, n=6) produced a parallel rightward shift of the 5-HT curve with no effect on the maximum response. The apparent pA2 was 10.4 ± 0.1, with a slope not significantly different from unity. At higher concentrations (3 x 10~8 M and above), the maximum response to 5-HT was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect of SB-207266-A was not due to a local anaesthetic action or to a direct antagonism at cholinergic receptors, since * DMPP-evoked contractions (a nicotinic receptor agonist which evokes acetylcholine release and hence a muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction) were unaffected even by a high concentration (lO'^M) of the compound.<br>
SB-207266-A was also tested against the contraction evoked by the 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist BIMU 1. In these experiments, SB-207266-A reduced the maximum response to BIMU 1, without causing a prior right-ward shift in the concentration-response curve.<br>
The apparent non-surmountable activity observed with SB-207266-A was not due to irreversible blockade of the 5-HT4 receptor, since the antagonistic effects of SB-207266-A could be reversed upon washout. Ac the highest concentrations (which reduce maximum 5-HT-evoked contractions), responses to 5-HT recovered within 90 minutes. Such a profile is consistent with that of a reversible antagonist.<br>
2)	Piglet Atria<br>
Compounds are tested in the piglet atria spontaneous beating screen (Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol 342, 619-622).<br>
SB-207266-A (10-7M) shifted the curve to the right with an apparent reduction in the maximum response when compared to control curves with 5-HT alone. The estimated pKfc (-logic Kb) of SB-207266-A (SB 207266 as HC1 salt) was 10.1 (n=2).<br>
3)	Rat oesophagus<br>
Rat oesophageal tunica muscularis mucosae is set up according to Baxter et. al. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 343,439-446 (1991). The inner smooth muscle tube of the muscularis mucosae is isolated and mounted for isometric tension recording in oxygenated (95% O2/5% CC&gt;2) Tyrodes solution at 37°C. All experiments are performed in pargyline pre-treated preparations (lOOfiM for 15 min followed by washout) and in the presence of cocaine (SO^M). Relaxant responses to 5-HT are obtained after pre-contracting the oesophagus tissue with carbachol (3(J,M).<br>
In the carbachol-contracted preparation, 5-HT produces concentration-dependent relaxations, with a pECfQ of 8.1 ± 0.03 (n=18). In contrast<br>
to the guinea-pig colon model, where the 5-HT4 receptor is neuronally-located, the receptor here is located on the smooth muscle. In the rat oesophagus preparation, SB-207266-A concentration - dependently acted as a non-surmountable antagonist and reduced the maximum response evoked by 5-HT. Because SB-207266-A depressed the maximum response it was not possible to determine a reliable pA2 estimate. However, the data obtained with the lowest effective concentration of SB-,207266-A are consistent with a pA2 of ^ 10.0. In view of the high selectivity of SB-207266-A as a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (see previous guinea-pig isolated colon data and subsequent radioligand binding selectivity analysis), it is likely that the apparent non-surmountable antagonism is due to a slow dissociation of the compound from the receptor. This occurs because of the low 5-HT4 receptor reserve in rat oesophagus and the high affinity of SB-207266-A at the 5-HT4 receptor, relative to 5-HT itself.<br>
4)	Binding to Piglet Hippocampal 5-HT4 Receptors<br>
The affinity of SB-207266-A for piglet hippocampal 5-HT4 receptors was determined from inhibition of binding of the ^^l-]&amp;belled 5-HT4-antagonist SB-207710 [Brown AM, Young TJ, Patch TL, Cheung CW, Kaumann AJ, Gaster LM and King FD (1993), Br JPharmacol; 110, 10PJ. This radioligand has a high affinity for piglet hippocampal membranes (Kj) = 86 ± 1 1 pM, Bmax = 16 + 3 fmol/mg protein (n=4)) while the pKj's for SB-207710 are 6 or less at 5-HTiA, 5-HTlC and 5-HT2 receptors. In addition, the 5-HT3-selective ligand granisetron inhibits [125l]_SB_207710 binding in hippocampus with apKi of below 5, indicating negligible binding of the radioligand to 5-HT3 receptors in this preparation. In this system, 5-HT binds to the 5-HT4 receptor with a moderate affinity (pKi 6.6 ± 0.1 (n=9)). SB-207266-A inhibited the binding of 125I-labelled SB-207710 with a pKi value of 9.48 ± 0.06 (n=3), a value slightly lower that the pA2/pKg estimates determined from antagonism of functional responses in other tissues.<br>
5)	Selectivity of SB-207266-A (SB 207266 as HC1 salt) in vitro<br>
SB-207266-A has been evaluated on a variety of non-5-HT4 receptor binding assays. The results are shown in the Table below. Functional studies on the rat stomach fundus reveal an affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor of 7.47. Clearly there are several orders of magnitude of selectivity for the 5-HT4 receptor over the other receptors tested.<br>

4)       5-HT-induced motility in dog gastric pouch<br>
Compounds are tested for inhibition in the in vivo method described in "Stimulation of canine motility by BRL 24924, a new gastric prokinetic agent", Bermudez et al, J. Gastrointestinal Motility, 1990, 2(4), 281-286.<br>
Dogs with previously prepared Heidenhain gastric pouches are fasted overnight. For each dog, dose-ranging studies with 5-HT are also performed previously to ascertain the minimal intravenous (iv) dose which evokes a reproducible, cholinergically-mediated increase in Ionic and phasic gastric contractility, usually 5 or 10 ug.kg'l. For each experiment, 5-HT is administered iv at 30 min intervals. After two consistent responses, antagonists are injected iv or dosed po in a gelatine capsule 15 min before the third injection of 5-HT.<br>
Both iv and po, SB-207266-A dose-dependontly antagonised the contractile response to 5-HT IJD^Q 1.3 (Confidence Limits 0.1-14.0) ug.kg'1 iv, 9.6 (CL 0.7-128) ug.kg'l po]. Furthermore there was no effect of SB-207266-A at any dose on basal motility. There was no consistent or significant effect with 5-HTi, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.<br>
The duration of action of SB-207266-A was determined after iv dosing. At the lower doses of 1 and 3 ug.kg-1 the effects were variable and apparently reversible, whilst at 10 and 100 ug.kg"^, the antagonism lasted for more than the duration of the experiment (285 minutes).<br>
5)       Antagonism in Anaesthetised Piglets<br>
In these experiments, antagonism is assessed against the 5-HT-evoked tachycardia, a response that is mediated, by the 5-HT4 receptors. All experiments were in 2-5 day old piglets in which the vagi were sectioned. SB-207266-A (SB 207266 as HC1 salt) at doses of 0.1,0.3 or 1.0 ugkg'1 given intravenously antagonised the 5-HT-evoked tachycardia in a dose- dependent manner (n=2 each). At doses which substantially antagonise this 5-HT4 receptor mediated effect of 5-<br>
HT (0.3, 1.0 ugkg"! i.v.), the recovery from antagonism was incomplete, over the duration of the experiment.<br>
IN VIVO TESTING FOR ANXIOLYTIC ACTIVITY Social Interaction Test in Rats<br>
Rats (male, Sprague Dawleys, Charles River, 250-300g) are housed in groups of eight in a holding room for 5 days. They are then housed singly in a room adjacent to the experimental room for 4 days prior to the experimental day. On the experimental day rats are administered vehicle, test compound or a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide, p.o. in pairs (n=8-16), at 15 minute intervals beginning at 10.00 a.m. 30 mins. later they are placed with a weight matched pair-mate (encountered for the first time) in the social interaction box in a separate room. The box is made of white perspex 54 cm x 37 cm x 26 cm with a transparent perspex front side and no lid. The floor is divided up into 24 squares and the box is brightly lit (115 lux). Active social interactive behaviours (grooming, sniffing, climbing over or under, following, biting, mounting and boxing) are scored blind for the next 15 min by remote video monitoring to give total interaction scores. The number of squares crossed by each rat is also scored and summed. After the end of each test the box is carefully wiped.<br>
Significantly increased total interaction scores were observed Ih after administration of SB-207266-A, (the HC1 salt of SB 207266) (0.01, 1, 10 mg.kg-1). The magnitude of this effect was somewhat smaller than that of the positive control chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5 mg.kg" 1 po) but not significantly so. The effect of SB-207266-A was not accompanied by any alteration in locomotion during the test and hence is consistent with anxiolysis.<br>
Tests demonstrating that prophylaxis/treatment of atrial remodelling / atrial fibrillation occurs via antagonism of 5-HT4 receptors<br>
If the skilled person wishes to demonstrate that the prophylaxes or treatments provided by some or all aspects of the invention occur via antagonism of 5-HT4 receptors, one or both of the following tests (which are conventiona] and well known to the skilled person) can optionally be performed:<br>
(1) Administer the 5-HT4 antagonist to a mammal (e.g. dog) which naturally or artificially has no 5-HT4 receptors expressed in its atrium (for example dogs naturally have no 5-HT4 receptors expressed in their atrium). If atrial remodelling induced in the test animal is not at least partly reversed (and/or the AF incidence is not reduced or inhibited) by administration of the 5-HT4 antagonist, then the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling (or AF) should occur via antagonism of 5-HT4 receptors.<br>
(2) Administer the 5-HT4 antagonist using the the pig model shown in Examples 1 and/or 2, but in the presence of a sufficient amount: of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist such as cisapride. If the administered 5-HT4 antagonist does not sucessfully reverse atrial remodelling at least partly e.g. by increasing AERP (and/or does not e.g. reduce AF incidence) then the prophylaxis or treatment of atrial remodelling (or AF) should occur via antagonism of 5-HT4 receptors.<br><br><br>
