				<td>CONCENTRIC CAMSHAFT WITH INDEPENDENT BEARING SURFACE FOR<br>
FLOATING LOBES<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001]   The present disclosure relates to engine camshaft assemblies,<br>
and more specifically to concentric camshaft assemblies.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Engines typically include a camshaft to actuate intake and<br>
exhaust valves. Some camshafts are concentric camshafts that provide for<br>
relative rotation between the intake and exhaust lobes. The intake lobes may be<br>
fixed to an outer shaft for rotation with the shaft and the exhaust lobes may be<br>
rotatably supported on the shaft. Alternatively, the exhaust lobes may be fixed to<br>
the outer shaft for rotation with the shaft and the intake lobes may be rotatably<br>
supported on the shaft. In either arrangement, the lobes that are rotatably<br>
supported on the shaft may use an outer surface of the outer shaft as a bearing<br>
surface. The use of the outer surface of the shaft as a bearing surface may<br>
require tighter tolerances for the outer diameter of the outer shaft, and therefore<br>
additional machining operations resulting in additional cost.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] A camshaft may include a first shaft, a first lobe member fixed to<br>
the first shaft, a second lobe member fixed to the first shaft, and a third lobe<br>
member. The first lobe member may include a first lobe portion and a first<br>
bearing portion extending axially from the first lobe portion. The second lobe<br>
member may include a second lobe portion and a second bearing portion<br>
extending axially from the second lobe portion toward the first bearing portion.<br>
The third lobe member may include a first end that is rotatably supported on the<br>
first bearing portion and a second end that is rotatably supported on the second<br>
bearing portion.<br>
[0005] An engine assembly may include an engine structure, a<br>
camshaft supported on the engine structure, and a cam phaser coupled to the<br>
camshaft. The camshaft may include a first shaft, a first lobe member fixed to<br>
the first shaft, a second lobe member fixed to the first shaft, and a third lobe<br>
member. The first lobe member may include a first lobe portion and a first<br>
bearing portion extending axially from the first lobe portion. The second lobe<br>
member may include a second lobe portion and a second bearing portion<br>
extending axially from the second lobe portion toward the first bearing portion.<br>
The third lobe member may include a first end that is rotatably supported on the<br>
first bearing portion and a second end that is rotatably supported on the second<br>
bearing portion. The cam phaser may selectively rotate the third lobe member<br>
on the first and second bearing portions.<br><br>
[0006] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] The drawings described herein are for illustration purposes only<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure in any way.<br>
[0008] Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of an engine assembly<br>
according to the present disclosure;<br>
[0009] Figure 2 is a perspective view of the camshaft and cam phaser<br>
of Figure 1;<br>
[0010] Figure 3 is a perspective exploded view of the camshaft of<br>
Figure 1; and<br>
[0011] Figure 4 is a fragmentary section view of the camshaft of Figure<br>
1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0012]   The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.  It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features.<br><br>
[0013] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary engine assembly 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. The engine assembly 10 may include an engine 12<br>
defining a plurality of cylinders 14 having pistons 16 disposed therein. The<br>
engine 12 may further include an intake valve 18, an exhaust valve 20, and<br>
intake and exhaust valve lift mechanisms 22, 24 for each cylinder 14, as well as<br>
a camshaft 26 and a cam phaser 28.<br>
[0014] The intake valve lift mechanism 22 may include a pushrod 30<br>
and a rocker arm 32. The exhaust valve lift mechanism 24 may additionally<br>
include a pushrod 30 and a rocker arm 32. The camshaft 26 may be supported<br>
by an engine structure such as an engine block. Pushrods 30 may be engaged<br>
with the camshaft 26 to actuate the rocker arms 32 and may selectively open the<br>
intake and exhaust valves 18, 20. While the engine assembly 10 is illustrated as<br>
a pushrod engine, it is understood that the present disclosure may be applicable<br>
to a variety of other engine configurations as well, such as overhead cam<br>
engines, where the camshaft 26 is supported by a cylinder head.<br>
[0015] With reference to Figures 2-4, the camshaft 26 may include first<br>
and second shafts 34, 36, a first set of lobe members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, a<br>
second set of lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54, and drive pins 55. In the present<br>
example, the first set of lobe members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 may form an intake lobe<br>
set and the second set of lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54 may form an exhaust lobe<br>
set. However, it is understood that alternate arrangements may be provided<br>
where the first set of lobe members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 may form an exhaust lobe<br><br>
set and the second set of lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54 may form an intake lobe<br>
set.<br>
[0016] The second shaft 36 may be rotatably disposed within the first<br>
shaft 34. The first shaft 34 may include slots 57 therethrough and the second<br>
shaft 36 may include apertures 59 that receive the pins 55 therein and couple the<br>
second set of lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54 for rotation with the second shaft 36.<br>
The slots 57 in the first shaft 34 may generally allow for a rotational travel of the<br>
pins 55 therein.<br>
[0017] The first set of lobe members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 may be fixed for<br>
rotation with the first shaft 34. The engagement between the first set of lobe<br>
members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 and the first shaft 34 may include a friction fit<br>
engagement. The second set of lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54 may be disposed<br>
between adjacent ones of the first set of lobe members 38, 40, 42, 44, 46.<br>
[0018] The lobe members 38, 46 may be generally similar to one<br>
another. Therefore, the lobe member 38 will be described with the<br>
understanding that the description applies equally to the lobe member 46. The<br>
lobe member 38 may include a journal portion 56, a lobe portion 58, and a<br>
bearing portion 60.<br>
[0019] As seen in Figure 4, the lobe member 38 may include a bore<br>
62 defining a first radial inner surface 64 at the journal and lobe portions 56, 58<br>
and a second radial inner surface 66 at the bearing portion 60. The second<br>
radial inner surface 66 may be offset radially outwardly relative to the first radial<br>
inner surface 64, forming a stepped region 68 therebetween.  More specifically,<br><br>
the first radial inner surface 64 may define a first diameter (D1) that is less than a<br>
second diameter (D2) defined by the second radial inner surface 66.<br>
[0020] The lobe members 40, 42, 44 may be generally similar to one<br>
another. Therefore, the lobe member 40 will be described with the<br>
understanding that the description applies equally to the lobe members 42, 44.<br>
The lobe member 40 may include a journal portion 70, first and second lobe<br>
portions 72, 74, and first and second bearing portions 76, 78. The first bearing<br>
portion 76 may extend axially from the first lobe portion 72 and toward the<br>
bearing portion 60 of the lobe member 38.<br>
[0021] The lobe member 40 may include a bore 80 defining a first<br>
radial inner surface 82 at the journal and lobe portions 70, 72, 74, a second radial<br>
inner surface 84 at the first bearing portion 76, and a third radial inner surface 86<br>
at the second bearing portion 78. The second and third radial inner surfaces 84,<br>
86 may be offset radially outwardly relative to the first radial inner surface 82,<br>
forming stepped regions 88, 90 therebetween. More specifically, the first radial<br>
inner surface 82 may define a third diameter (D3) that is less than a fourth<br>
diameter (D4) defined by the second and third radial inner surfaces 84, 86.<br>
[0022] The lobe members 48, 50, 52, 54 may be generally similar to<br>
one another. Therefore, the lobe member 48 will be described with the<br>
understanding that the description applies equally to the lobe members 50, 52,<br>
54. The lobe member 48 may include first and second lobe portions 92, 94 and a<br>
connecting portion 96 extending axially between the first and second lobe<br>
portions 92, 94 and fixing the first and second lobe portions 92, 94 to one<br><br>
another. The connecting portion 96 may generally form a fixation region for the<br>
lobe member 48 and may include an aperture 98 that receives the pin 55 to<br>
couple the lobe member 48 to the second shaft 36.<br>
[0023] The lobe member 48 may include a bore 100 defining first and<br>
second radial inner surfaces 102, 104 at the first and second lobe portions 92, 94<br>
and a third radial inner surface 106 at the connecting portion 96. The first and<br>
second radial inner surfaces 102, 104 may be offset radially outwardly relative to<br>
the third radial inner surface 106, forming stepped regions 108, 110<br>
therebetween. More specifically, the first and second radial inner surfaces 102,<br>
104 may define a fifth diameter (D5) that is greater than a sixth diameter (D6)<br>
defined by the third radial inner surface 106.<br>
[0024] As seen in Figure 4, the first and second radial inner surfaces<br>
102, 104 of lobe member 48 may be rotationally supported on the bearing<br>
portions 60, 76. The sixth diameter (D6) may be less than the outer diameter<br>
(D7) of the bearing portions 60, 76.<br>
[0025] As discussed above, the first shaft 34 may be located within the<br>
bores 62, 80, 100 of the lobe members 38, 40, 48. The first shaft 34 may have<br>
an outer diameter (D8) that is less than the second diameter (D2) defined by the<br>
second radial inner surface 66 of the lobe member 38 and that is less than the<br>
fourth diameter (D4) defined by the second and third radial inner surfaces 84, 86<br>
of the lobe member 40. An annular clearance (C1) may exist radially between an<br>
entire circumference of the first shaft 34 and the second radial inner surface 66 of<br><br>
the lobe member 38 and between an entire circumference of the first shaft 34<br>
and the second and third radial inner surfaces 84, 86 of the lobe member 40.<br>
[0026] During assembly, the second radial inner surface 66 of the<br>
lobe member 38 and the second and third radial inner surfaces 84, 86 of the lobe<br>
member 43 may be free from direct contact with the first shaft 34. Therefore, the<br>
coupling between the lobe members 38, 42 and the first shaft 34 does not distort<br>
the bearing portions 60, 76, 78. For example, a radial outward force may be<br>
applied from within the first shaft 34 to deform the first shaft 34 and provide the<br>
frictional engagement between the lobe members 38, 42 and the first shaft .34 at<br>
the first radial inner surface 64 of the lobe member 38 and at the first radial inner<br>
surface 82 of the lobe member 42. Due to the offset between the second radial<br>
inner surface 66 of the lobe member 38 and the first shaft 34 and the offset<br>
between the second and third radial inner surfaces 84, 86 of the lobe member 40<br>
and the first shaft 34, the portion of the first shaft 34 located within the 60, 76, 78<br>
may be deformed without deforming or distorting the bearing portions 60, 76, 78.<br>
The radial outward force may be applied in a variety of ways including ballizing,<br>
expanding mandrel, and hydraulic expansion.<br>
[0027] The sixth diameter (D6) defined by the third radial inner surface<br>
106 of the lobe member 48 may also be greater than the outer diameter (D8) of<br>
the first shaft 34. An annular clearance (C2) may exist radially between an entire<br>
circumference of the first shaft 34 and the third radial inner surface 106 of the<br>
lobe member 48. Therefore, the surface finish of the first shaft 34 does not affect<br>
the bearing support of the lobe member 48. The tolerance for the outer diameter<br><br>
(D8) of the first shaft 34 may also be increased since the first shaft 34 does not<br>
provide any direct bearing support for the lobe member 48.<br><br>
