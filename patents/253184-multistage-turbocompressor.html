Specification<br>
Multistage Turbocompressor<br>
The present invention pertains to a multistage turbocompressor, which is designed as a geared compressor with an integrated gear, with the features of the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Prior-art geared compressors (DE 974 418, EP 0 440 902 Bl, EP 1 302 668 Al) are characterized by a greater wheel that meshes with a plurality of pinions. One or two compressor stages are each fastened to the pinions. The pinions surround the greater wheel, which is driven directly, as the shaft of the greater wheel is coupled with the driving shaft. Another possibility of coupling the drive unit to the geared compressor may take place via a driving pinion, which, like the pinions of the compressor stages, likewise meshes with the greater wheel. Because of the design of a geared compressor, the driving pinion is arranged under the greater wheel. Such a geared compressor requires a height offset in installation, since the shaft of the greater wheel and the shaft of the drive unit lie apart from one another by a distance that results from the sum of the radius of the greater wheel and the radius of the drive unit Consequently, additional space is required for installation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to design the multistage turbocompressor with integrated gear of this class such that a compact arrangement of a line of machines consisting of tmt&gt;ocompressor and drive unit is possible.<br><br>
The object is accomplished according to the present invention by die characterizing features of claim 1 in a tinbocompressor with integrated gear of this class.<br>
A line of machines, in which a common central plane is present for the turbocompressor and the drive unit, can be set up by means of the multistage turbocompressor designed according to the present invention. If this line of machines is expanded by additional units, such as, for example, a motor/generator and/or an expander, then the common centra] plane is available for the additional units as welL By means of the common central plane, a height offset in the base frame, on which the units are assembled, as well as in the foundation bed (steel framing or concrete) of the line of machines is avoided. The space required for the installation of the line of machines becomes smaller, as a result of which the production, transportation, operation and maintenance of the line of machines become simpler and more cost-favorable. The construction of larger compressors becomes possible, since the space required for the compressor housing is increased. Finally, the mechanical strain on the individual components, such as the driving pinion, the bearing and the gear housing, is reduced<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in the drawings and is explained in detail below. In the drawings:<br>
Figure 1	shows a lateral view of a line of machines,<br>
Figure 2	shows the top view of Figure 1, and<br><br>
Figure 3	the perspective view of the gear of a geared turbocompressor inserted into the line of<br>
machines according to Figure 1.<br>
The line of machines shown in Figure 1 is part of a chemical plant for the treatment and the further processing of gases. Such a line of machines comprises a drive unit 1 and a geared compressor 2. Depending on the type of the chemical plant, the line of machines may comprise a motor/generator 3 and an expander 4 as welL The individual units are coupled to one another and are mounted on a base fiame, the machine bed 5, which rests on a concrete or steel foundation. A plurality of coolers, a condenser and additional apparatuses needed for the operation of the plant are located under the machine bed 5,<br>
The drive unit 1 is preferably embodied as a steam turbine, whose driven shaft is connected to the driving shaft 6 of the following geared compressor 2. The geared compressor 2 is a multistage tuibocompressor with integrated gear and is used for compressing a gas.<br>
The geared compressor 2 according to Figure 3 comprises a housing 7, in which a driving pinion 8, a greater wheel 9 and additional pinions 10, 14, 15 are arranged. The driving pinion 8 is fastened to the driving shaft 6, which is mounted in the housing 7 of the geared compressor 2, On one side, the driving pinion 8 meshes with a first pinion 10, which is fastened, in a manner adapted to rotate in unison, to a first pinion shaft 11. On its one end, the first pinion shaft 11 has a bladed wheel, which rotates in the spiral housing 12 of a compressor, which represents the first compressor stage I of the multistage geared compressor 2.<br><br>
On the side facing away from the first pinion 10, the driving pinion 8 meshes with the greater wheel 9, which is fastened, in a manner adapted to rotate in unison^ to a shaft 13 mounted in the housing 7. The power of the drive unit 1 fed via the driving pinion 8 is simultaneously released to the greater wheel 9 and the first pinion 10 belonging to the first compressor stage L<br>
The greater wheel 9 meshes with a second pinion 14 and a third pinion 15, winch are fastened, in a manner adapted to rotate in unison, to a second and third pinion shaft 16, 17, respectively, mounted in the housing 7. At its ends, the second pinion shaft 16 has the bladed wheels of a second and third compressor stage II, IDL At its ends, the third pinion shaft 17 has the bladed wheels of a fourth and fifth compressor stage IV, V with the spiral housings 18, 19. All compressor stages are mounted in an overiiung manner on the corresponding pinion shafts.<br>
The driving shaft 6, first pinion shaft 11, second pinion shaft 16 and shaft 13 of the greater wheel 9 lie in the same horizontal plane 20. The third pinion shaft 17 lies above this plane 20. In the view of Figure 3, in relation to the greater wheel 9, the driving pinion 8 is in the 9 o'clock position, the second pinion 14 is in the 3 o'clock position and the third pinion 15 is in the 12 o'clock position. In relation to the driving pinion 8, the first pinion 10 is in the 9 o'clock position and the greater wheel 9 is in the 3 o'clock position.<br>
The core pieces of the line of machines are the geared compressor 2 and the steam turbine as the drive unit 1. The motor/generator 3 and the expander 4 are components, which can also be omitted together or alone depending on the type of the chemical process. If a motor/generator 3 is installed, then it is connected either directly or via a gear to the shaft 13 of the greater wheel 9.<br><br>
The line of machines can be started with the steam turbine as the drive unit 1, if steam is available. The motor (motor/generator 3 connected as a motor) then takes over the drive of the line of machines from the synchronous speed of the motor. The expander 4 releases power only if the chemical process has been started, and the exhaust gas or exhaust steam from the process drives the expander 4. The expander 4 may also be operated with air, which the geared compressor 2 has compressed, so that some of the energy can be recovered.<br>
The line of machines may also be started with the motor (motor'generator 3 connected as a motor). If steam is only generated once after the start as a result of the ongoing chemical process, then the steam turbine, as the drive unit 1, then further drives the line of machines.<br>
If the expander 4 is absent, and if only one generator (motor/generator 3 connected as a generator) is installed, the steam turbine, as the drive unit 1, releases so much power that the geared compressor 2 can be operated and the additional power can be fed as electric energy from the generator into the power supply.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
