				<td>1 DESCRIPTION ACRYLIC RUBBER COMPOSITION AND ITS VULCANIZED PRODUCT TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an acrylic rubber composition and its vulcanized product, having good vulcanization characteristics and an excellent balance between processability, mechanical properties of rubber and compression set.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Since an acrylic rubber composition is excellent in heat resistance and oil resistance, it is used for hose parts and sealing articles in an engine room of a vehicle. However, there is a demand for greater heat resistance than ever because thermal conditions become severer due to recent exhaust emission controls, a trend toward higher output power of engine, and so on.<br>
Furthermore, the hose parts, the sealing articles and others are required to have appropriate physical properties such as normal-state properties and compression set, and are recently further required to improve a vulcanization rate for a purpose of improved productivity and a scorch property for a purpose of improved processability.<br>
In order to deal with these requirements, an acrylic rubber composition having a carboxyl group as a crosslinking site is known as a material with balanced properties of processability, a vulcanization rate, normal-state properties, compression set and heat resistance (for example, cf. Patent Document 1).<br>

 <br>
 <br>
13<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the tertiary amine compound as long as it is a compound wherein each of three substituents R1, R2 and R3 in the formula is independently at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group and a benzyl group. Examples of the amine include dimethyloctylamine, dimethyldecylamine, dimethyldodecylamine, dimethyllaurylamine, dimethylmyristylamine, dimethylpalmitylamine, dimethylstearylamine, dimethylbehenylamine, dilaurylmonomethylamine, trioctylamine, methyldioleylamine,<br>

For application of the acrylic rubber composition to practical use, molding and vulcanization can be conducted with addition of a filler, a reinforcing agent, a plasticizer, an anti-aging agent, a stabilizer, a lubricant or the like depending on its purpose of application.<br>
The filler and the reinforcing agent can be those conventionally used<br>
 <br>
14 for rubber, without any particular restrictions thereon. Examples thereof include carbon black, silicic acid anhydride such as silica, surface-treated calcium carbonate, and so on. The filler and/or the reinforcing agent may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. An addition amount of the filler and/or the reinforcing agent is from 20 to 150 parts by mass, preferably from 30 to 100 parts by mass in total, to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic rubber composition.<br>
The plasticizer can be any one of various types of plasticizers conventionally used for rubber, without any particular restrictions thereon. Examples thereof include an ester type plasticizer, an ether type plasticizer such as polyoxyethylene ether, and so on. These plasticizers may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds. An addition amount of the plasticizer is preferably at most 75 parts by mass, more preferably at most 50 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic rubber composition.<br>
The anti-aging agent can be any one of those conventionally used for rubber, without any particular restrictions thereon. Examples thereof include an amine type, an imidazole type, a metal salt of carbamic acid, a phenol type, a wax, and so on. An addition amount of the anti-aging agent is preferably from 0.1 to 15 parts by mass, more preferably from 0.5 to 10 parts by mass, to 100 parts by mass of the acrylic rubber composition.<br>
A rubber component in the acrylic rubber composition is mainly composed of the carboxyl group-containing acrylic rubber, but a natural rubber or a synthetic rubber such as IIR, BR, NBR, HNBR, CR, EPDM, FKM, Q, CSM, CO, ECO or CM may be blended, if necessary, in addition to the carboxyl group-containing acrylic rubber. It is noted that these abbreviations are based on ISO1629.<br>
The acrylic rubber composition of the present invention is produced by<br>
 <br>
15 blending and mixing the above-mentioned components and a method thereof is one of conventional methods. For example, the mixing is conducted using a mixing machine such as a Banbury mixer or a roll mill, preferably, at a temperature of from 10 to 80°C, preferably, for from 3 to 30 minutes. Conventional methods are also used for obtaining a vulcanized product from the acrylic rubber composition of the present invention. Namely, when the acrylic rubber composition of the present invention is kneaded, molded and vulcanized, machines and conditions adopted therefor are those conventionally used in the rubber field.<br>
The acrylic rubber composition and its vulcanized product are used, particularly, for rubber hoses, sealing articles such as gaskets and packings, and vibration-proofing parts. Specific examples of the rubber hoses include a transmission oil cooler hose, an engine oil cooler hose, a turbo intercooler hose, a turbo air duct hose, a power steering hose, a hot air hose, a radiator hose; hoses for an oil system and a fuel system including a high pressure system, and a drain system hose in other industrial machines and building machines, and so on.<br>
Specific examples of the sealing articles include an engine head cover gasket, an oil pan gasket, an oil seal, a lip seal packing, an O-ring, a transmission seal gasket, a seal gasket of a crankshaft or a camshaft, valve stem, a power steering seal, a belt cover seal, a boot material for CVJ (constant velocity joint) or R&amp;P (rack and pinion), and others.<br>
Examples of rubber vibration insulator include a damper pulley, a center support cushion, a suspension bush, an engine mount, and so on.<br>
Particularly, the acrylic rubber composition and its vulcanized product of the present invention have excellent mechanical properties and also have excellent cold resistance, oil resistance and heat resistance, so that they<br>
 <br>
16 can be quite suitably used as a rubber hose for automobile, or as an oil sealing product such as a gasket, which recently tends to be used in a severer environment.<br>
A structure of a rubber hose may be a single hose obtained from the acrylic rubber composition of the present invention. Furthermore, according to an application thereof, the structure may be a composite hose obtained by combining a layer composed of the acrylic rubber composition of the present invention with any synthetic rubber other than the acrylic rubber of the present invention, e.g., fluorine type rubber, fluorine-modified acrylic rubber, hydrin rubber, CSM, CR, NBR, HNBR or ethylene-propylene rubber, as an inner layer, an intermediate layer or an outer layer.<br>
Furthermore, depending on properties required for the rubber hose, it is possible to provide an intermediate or outermost layer of the rubber hose with a reinforcing fiber or wire, as is generally commonly carried out. EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention is explained further in detail referring to examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is by no means construed as restricted to these examples. <production of carboxyl group-containing acrylic rubber><br>
