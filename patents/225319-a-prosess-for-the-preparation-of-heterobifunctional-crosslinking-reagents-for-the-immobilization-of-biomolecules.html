				<td>The present invention provides a process for the preparation of heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents of formula I for the immobilization of biomolecules. The reagents consist of two different chemically reactive groups, one reacts selectively with unmodified surfaces with silanol functionalities and the other one with nucleophilic groups present in the biomolecules (biomolecular ligand molecules). The basic purpose of these reagents is to form a covalent linkage between two different species. More precisely, the utility of this invention is to immobilize a variety of bioactive ligands on the unmodified glass surface.<br>
Hetero- and homobifunctional reagents have been finding a widespread use in the area of genomics and proteomics (Kreig et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 83 (1986) 8604; Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, San Diego, Academic Press (1996) 284). These reagents are organic molecules which have two reactive functional groups either similar or identical (homobifunctional reagents) or different (heterobifunctional reagents). The functional groups react with nucleophilic groups (aminoalkyl- and mercaptoalkyl-) of the bioactive ligands. The reaction can occur either intramolecularly or intermolecularly. Simultaneously, bridges within a molecule or heteromolecular complexes can be formed. The general purpose of these reagents is to serve as molecular tools to attach biomolecules on the surface for various types of analytical and biological applications. The molecules, which can be attached through homo- and heterobifunctional reagents, are proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, enzymes, polysaccharides, etc. These immobilized biomolecules can be used to analyze antigen-antibody interactions, structure of multi-enzyme complexes, the arrangement of proteins in membranes and many other biological applications.<br>
Microarray technology is one of the most recent and important applications of synthetic oligonucleotides (Podyminogin et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 29 (2001) 5090; Rehman et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 27 (1999) 649; Zhao et al., 29 (2001) 955; Timofeev et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 24 (1996) 3142). DNA microarray is a powerful tool, which allows the simultaneous detection of many different target molecules present in a sample. The technology deals with the covalent fixing of oligonucleotides (small fragments of DNA), cDNA, PCR fragments, etc on the solid or polymer surfaces. These DNA chips or biochips can be used for mutation detection, SNP analysis, disease diagnosis, monitoring of gene expression, etc. A number of methods have reported for the preparation of oligonucleotide arrays using homo- and heterobifunctional reagents. Immobilization can be accomplished in two ways, viz., (i) the reaction occurs between the reagent and suitably modified oligonucleotides followed by reaction with functional groups on the solid surface to<br><br>
obtain immobilized oligonucleotides, and (ii) the method involves reaction of the reagent with functional groups on the polymeric surface followed by reaction with suitably modified oligonucleotides to obtain immobilized oligonucleotides.<br>
In general, oligonucleotide arrays are solid surfaces consisting of hundreds or thousands of oligomers covalently attached at discrete locations, which are available for hybridization. Currently, two methods are being followed for the construction of oligonucleotide arrays. The first one involves direct synthesis of oligonucleotides at the pre-determined sites on the solid or polymeric surfaces using photolithographic technique (Fodor et al.. Science 251 (1991) 767). The second method is based on the immobilization of pre-synthesized oligonucleotides on the solid or polymeric surfaces using a suitable hetero- or homobifunctional reagent or a coupling reagent (Beier and Hoheisel, Nucl. Acids Res., 27 (1999) 1970). The method provides flexibility in the sense that it does not require expensive chemistry and sophisticated instrumentation. Modifications can easily be incorporated in the oligomers according to the functionalities present on the solid surface. This method is preferred for generating low to moderate density oligonucleotide arrays. Generally, linking units are added at 3'-end, internal positions or 5'-end. For hybridization assays, the position of attachment is irrelevant.<br>
Several surface materials have been tested so far, such as nylon, nitrocellulose, polypropylene, polystyrene, silicon, glass. Teflon, etc. Out of these, glass and polypropylene stand a good chance because these materials can easily be derivatized to generate functional groups on the surface, viz., aminoalkyl, carboxyl, aldehyde, mercaptoalkyl, etc. Moreover, glass slides are readily available, inexpensive and possess a relatively homogeneous chemical surface. Glass has an additional advantage in that the currently used laser scanners can also be used.<br>
A number of methods have been reported for the immobilization of oligonucleotides on the polymeric surfaces. In one approach, Beattie et al. (Mol. Biotech., 1995, 4, 213) have employed 3-glycidyloxypropyltriethoxysilane as a heterobifunctional reagent to immobilize aminoalkylated oligonucleotides. They generated electrophilic surfaces (epoxy groups) by reacting the unmodified glass slides with the reagent, 3-glycidyloxypropyltriethoxysilane, followed by spotting of the aminoalkylated oligonucleotides. Similarly, in another approach, mercaptoalkylated oligonucleotides were conjugated to 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane via disulfide formation (Kumar et al.. Nucleic Acids Res., 28 (2000) e71). Subsequently, these silylated oligonucleotides were spotted on the virgin glass slide to obtain immobilized oligonucleotides. Further, they used<br><br>
these slides for hybridization experiments using complementary oligomers labeled with cy3 and cy5 fluorescent dyes.<br>
Some of the methods for immobilization of biomolecules have been reported using nitrenes and carbenes as reactive species generated upon UV irradiation. However, these species are extremely reactive and sometimes immediately react with water or organic compounds, organic solvents, etc. This process results in the loss of photoactivity.<br>
Recently, Koch et al. (Bioconjugate Chem., 11 (2000) 474) have demonstrated that anthraquinone linked oligonucleotides can be immobilized at any carbon-containing surfaces with active hydrogen atoms. They have synthesized a phosphoramidite reagent of the anthraquinone linker and finally coupled to oligomer chain after synthesis of a desired oligomer. Anthraquinone-oligonucleotide conjugates were then immobilized on polystyrene plates. The same conjugates can be immobilized on other polymeric surfaces, e.g. polycarbonates, polypropylene, polyethylene, etc. Photochemically immobilization of oligonucleotides appears to be superior to currently known chemical procedures.<br>
Since the above mentioned methods are applicable to immobilize ligands on polymeric or unmodified glass surfaces, it was then decided to develop heterobifunctional reagents of formula I, which could be used for immobilizing a variety of biomolecules, such as oligonucleotides, peptides, enzymes, proteins etc. on the surface of choice.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is in providing novel heterobifunctional reagents of formula I, where S stands for a chemical group, which can react with unmodified glass surfaces containing silanol functionalities and R stands for a chemically reactive group, which can react with the nucleophilic groups present in the bioactive ligands, such as oligonucleotides, peptides, enzymes, proteins, etc. Therefore, the proposed reagents can easily be used for the covalent fixing of the biomolecules on the commercially available unmodified glass surfaces containing silanol groups. Further, the use of these reagents makes the immobilization process a rapid and economical.<br>
