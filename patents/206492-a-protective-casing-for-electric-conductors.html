The cover member, at the said other side is provided, along its length, with a rib, at least the lip or the rib being flexib~e, such that whenever the cover member is thrust down on the base member, the rib rides over the lip and snaps into engagement with the notch, to lock the cover member and base member together. Furthermore whenever the cover member is prised off the base member, the rib snaps out of engagement with the notch, to open and expose the interior of the base member.</td>

This invention relates to a protective casing for electric conductors.<br>
Protective casings for electric conductors are known to the art. Such casings are intended to encapsulate electric conductors, in domestic and industrial wiring systems, so that the conductors are isolated from human contact. The casings also serve to provide an aesthetic appearance in buildings, by concealing electric conductors from view. The casings can be fixed to the wall or the ceiling of a building and some times even on the floor of a building, wherever the electric conductors are reguired to be disposed.<br>
The advantages of the casing proposed herein are that it has a cover and base member, which are hingeably attached together. The cover is intended for closing and opening the casing, for inserting or removing the electric conductors within? or for attending to repair work on the said conductors.<br>
In the casing proposed herein, the cover member can be easily locked to the base member and as easily<br><br>
unlocked therefrom.<br>
Various other features of the casing proposed herein will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The protective casing for electric conductors, according to this invention, comprises a channelled base member for receiving at least one electric conductor therein, said base member being hingeably attached, at one side of the casing, to a cover member, both base member and cover member being in strip form and of the same length; the base member, at the other side of the casing, and along its length, being provided with an inclined lip and a notch therebelow; the cover member, at the said other side being provided, along its length, with a rib, at least the lip or the rib being flexible, such that whenever the cover member is thrust down on the base member, the rib rides over the lip and snaps into engagement with the notch, to lock the cover member and base member together; and such that whenever the cover member is prised off the base member, the rib snaps out of engagement with<br><br>
the notch, to open and expose the interior of the base member.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, the single Figure in which illustrates, by way of example, one of the various possible embodiments of the casing proposed herein.<br>
The casing has a channelled base member B for receiving one or more electric conductors.<br>
The base member B is hingeably attached at H, at one side of the casing, to the cover member C, both base member and cover member being in strip form and of the same length £r.<br>
A preferred form of hingeably attaching the base member to the cover member is by having the base member and the cover member made of flexible plastic, such that the portion H of the casing is flexible enough to be bent to serve as a hinge.<br>
The other side of the casing, along its length,<br><br>
is provided with an inclined lip L and a notch N therebelow.<br>
The cover member, at the said other side, is provided,  along its length, with a rib R.   Either the lip or the rib or both are flexible. This is achieved by having the lip or the rib or both made of flexible plastic.<br>
The arrangement is such that When the cover member c is thrust down on the base member B, the rib R rides over the lip L and flexibly snaps into engagement with the notch N to lock the cover member and base member together; and such that whenever the cover member is prised off the base member, the rib flexibly snaps out of engagement with the notch, to open and expose the interior of the base member.<br>
The casing may be manufactured in various lengths £ and can be cut into smaller lengths of the desired magnitudes to suit the requirements of a specific application.<br><br>
The casing will be fixed anywhere in a building to encapsulate elecric conductors, such as, on the wall, ceiling or the floor of a building.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description, and not of limitation, having regard to the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1.	A protective casing for electric conductors comprising a channelled base member for receiving at least one electric conductor therein, said base member being hingeably attached, at one side of the casing, to a cover member, both base member and cover member being in strip form and of the same length; the base member, at the other side of the casing, and along its length, being provided with an inclined lip and a notch therebelow; the cover member, at the said other side being provided, along its length, with a rib, at least the lip or the rib being flexible, such that whenever the cover member is thrust down on the base member, the rib rides over the lip and snaps into engagement with the notch, to lock the cover member and base member together; and such that whenever the cover member is prised off the base member, the rib snaps out of engagement with the notch, to open and expose  the  interior of the base  member.<br>
2.	A protective casing for electric conductors substantially as herein described with reference<br><br>
to,  and as illustrated in, the  accompanying drawings•<br><br></td>
