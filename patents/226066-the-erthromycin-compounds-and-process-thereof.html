The products of general formula (I) have a very good antibiotic activity on gram Â® bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci.<br>
The compounds of the invention can therefore be used as medicaments in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible germs and in particular, in that of staphylococcia, such as staphylococcal septicemias, malignant staphylococcia of the face or skin, pyodermatitis, septic or suppurating wounds, boils, anthrax, phlegmons, erysipelas and acne, staphylococcia such as acute primary or post-influenzal<br><br>
angina, bronchopneumonia, pulmonary suppuration, streptococcia such as acute angina, otitis, sinusitis, scarlet fever, pneumococcia such as pneumonia, bronchitis; brucellosis, diphteri, gonococcal infection.<br>
The products of the present invention are also active against infections caused by germs such as Haemophilus influenzae, Rickettsies, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia, Legionella, Ureaplasma, Toxoplasma or by germs of the Mycobacterium genus.<br>
Therefore a subject of the present invention is also, as medicaments and, in particular antibiotic medicaments, the products of formula (I) as defined above, as well as their addition salts with pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acids.<br>
More particularly a subject of the invention is, as medicaments and, in particular antibiotic medicaments, the product of Example 3 and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
A subject of the invention is also the pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one of the medicaments defined above, as active ingredient.<br>
These compositions can be administered by buccal, rectal, parenteral route or by local route as a topical application on the skin and mucous membranes, but the preferred administration route is the buccal route.<br>
They can be solid or liquid and be presented in the pharmaceutical forms commonly used in human medicine, such as for example, plain or sugar-coated tablets, capsules, granules, suppositories, injectable preparations, ointments, creams, gels; they are prepared according to the usual methods. The active ingredient can be incorporated with excipients usually employed in these pharmaceutical compositions, such as talc, gum arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non-aqueous vehicles, fatty substances of animal or vegetable origin, paraffin derivatives, glycols, various wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agents, preservatives.<br>
These compositions can also be presented in the form a<br>
powder intended to be dissolved extemporaneously in an appropriate vehicle, for example apyrogenic sterile water.<br>
Also a subject of the invention is a preparation process characterized in that a compound of formula (II):<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
in which A, B and Z retain their previous meaning is subjected to the action of a compound of formula (III!<br>
HNoOR<br>
in which R retains its previous meaning in order to obtain the corresponding compound of formula (I), then if desired, the hydroxyl in position 2' is released and/or subjected to the action of an acid in order to form the salt, and/or to the action of" an agent which modifies the R radical.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) used as a starting product can be prepared according to the process described in the European Patent 0676409.  In a preferred implementation:<br>
-	the release of the hydroxyl in position 2' is carried out<br>
by methanolysis,<br>
-	the salification is carried out according to standard<br><br>
processes.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Method of dilutions in liquid medium<br>
A series of tubes are prepared in which the same quantity of sterile nutritive medium is distributed. Increasing quantities of the product to be studied are distributed into each tube, then each tube is sown with a bacterial strain.  After incubation for twenty-four hours in a heating chamber at 37Â°C, the growth inhibition is evaluated by transillumination, which allows the minimal inhibitory concentrations (M.I.C.) to be determined, expressed in<br>
micrograms/cm .<br>
