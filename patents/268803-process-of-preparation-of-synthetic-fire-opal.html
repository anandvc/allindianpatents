				<td>The present invention relates to the field of synthetic gemstones. More specifically, it relates to a method of preparation of a synthetic fire opal that has similar physical and chemical properties as a natural fire opal.<br>
Natural opal is a gemstone made of hydrated amorphous silica (chemical formula Si02 .nH2O). Based on visual appearance, natural opals can be classified as precious opals, common opals, and fire opals. Precious opals exhibit a 'play-of-color'. Play-of-color is the phenomenon of changing spectral hues produced by the diffraction of white light through a microstructure of orderly arrayed silica spheres. Common opals have high opacity and do not exhibit the play-of-color. Fire opals are transparent or translucent opals with an orange or red body color.<br>
Natural fire opal is an opal that has been mined from the earth and may be treated in a number of ways to enhance its qualities. Natural fire opals are rare and expensive. Also, in natural opals, there is a lot of variation in color from piece to piece. Natural fire opals have long been used as ornamental stones in jewelry. However, natural fire opals are brittle and heat sensitive. Most natural fire opals also show crazing. Crazing is the phenomenon of developing cracks in the opal with the passage of time or when the fire opal is subjected to heating.<br>
Simulants of natural opals exist in the market. These simulants are used as alternatives for natural opals. Simulants are artificial stones that resemble the natural opal, but their chemical composition and physical properties are not the same as natural opals. Synthetic opals have the same chemical composition and physical properties as natural opals. Scientists have been able to produce synthetic opals in laboratory conditions.<br>
A paper titled 'Some Aspects of Precious Opal Synthesis', by S. V. Filin, A. I. Puzynin, and V. N. Samoilov, published in 'Australian Gemmologist', Vol.21, No.7, 2002, pp. 278-282, describes one such method of preparation of synthetic opals. The paper describes the synthesis of an opal by a multi-step process. In the first stage of the process, synthesis of monodisperse particles of silica of about SOOnm size is carried out<br>
by the hydrolysis of tetraethyl ester of orthosilicic acid, Si(OC2H5)4 in ethanol. In the second stage, the raw precursor of opal is precipitated by spontaneous sedimentation.<br>
*<br>
The sedimentation time is about seven months. In the third stage, the precursor opal is dried by a method of supercritical drying in an autoclave to obtain samples of any dimension within a time span of 10-12 hours. This is followed by sintering in a furnace at temperatures of 600°C, 800°C, and 1000°C. The total time involved in the synthesis of a synthetic opal is 10 months.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,703,020, titled 'Process for the Production of Jewelling and Ornamental Material', assigned to Kyocera Corporation, Kyoto, Japan, describes another such method of production of synthetic opal. This patent describes a process of production of a jewelling and ornamental material which produces a play-of-color similar to a natural opal. The main raw material used is amorphous silica spheres with a particle diameter within the range of 0.15 to 0.4 microns. The mixture of amorphous silica spheres and water is subjected to sedimentation for several weeks to several months. The resulting jelly-like precipitate is spontaneously dried, and then calcined to a temperature of about 800°C to form a structure composed of regularly three-dimensionally arranged amorphous silica spheres, Zirconium alkoxide, in the form of a solution, is impregnated in the three-dimensional structure. The,entire structure is then calcined at a temperature of about 1150°C for about 30 hours to obtain a jewelling and ornamental material.<br>
The above-mentioned methods of preparation of synthetic opals depend upon the three-dimensional arrangement of amorphous silica spheres to produce play-of-color. Therefore, such methods may not be applied for the preparation of synthetic fire opals without play-of-color. In addition, such methods may not lead to the production of synthetic fire opals in different colorsn Another limitation is the time taken by each of these processes. The entire process in the existing methods of preparation of synthetic opals takes about 7-10 months. Further, they also require production of amorphous silica spheres with particle diameter in the specified range, as the first step in the process of preparation of a synthetic opal.<br>
It is therefore evident that there is a need for a process of preparation of synthetic fire opals. The process should produce synthetic fire opals with color uniformity. The process should be less time consuming and should lead to the preparation of synthetic fire opals in different colors. Further, the process should produce synthetic fire opals, not limited by the particle size of the raw material.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of a synthetic fire opal for use in jewelry and ornaments.<br>
The disclosed method involves the following steps: Absolute ethanol (99.9%), concentrated nitric acid, distilled water, and an inorganic salt are mixed in a closed container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Then, the mixture is vigorously stirred for 1 to 10 hours by using a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous reaction mixture. Thereafter, Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) is carefully added to the homogeneous reaction mixture to obtain a clear sol. The clear sol is stored at room temperature for 5 to 10 days to obtain a wet gel. The wet gel is dried at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 100°C to obtain a colored, and transparent material. Subsequently, the dried gel is further heat treated at temperatures ranging from 250°C to 800°C to obtain a colored, transparent, and hard synthetic fire opal.<br>
The synthetic fire opal has the same physical and chemical properties as that of a<br>
natural fire opal. The synthetic fire opal is characterized by a hardness of 5.5 to 6.5 on<br>
the Mho scale, atleast two percent of water content, refractive index of 1.37 to 1.47, and<br>
specific gravity of 1.96 to 2.20. Further, the synthetic fire opal may be of any color, for<br>
example, orange, pink, red, green, yellow, blue and the like. The synthetic opal may also<br>
be colorless.	;<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the process of preparation of synthetic fire opal takes about 4 to 6 weeks, which is substantially less in comparison to already known processes of synthetic opal production. Further, in the present invention, the process of preparation of synthetic fire opal is not affected by the particle<br>
size of the raw material. There is no requirement for uniform size particles of silica in this<br>
method. The present invention leads to the preparation of synthetic fire opal with color<br>
uniformity. Further, the synthetic fire opal so prepared may be of any color, i.e., orange,<br>
pink, red, green, yellow, blue and the like. The synthetic fire opal may also be colorless.<br>
The synthetic fire opal is hard and transparent. The synthetic fire opal is more stable<br>
than natural fire opal and does not show crazing. The synthetic fire opal can be used to<br>
make beads, cabochons, cut stones, or other shapes that can be used in various types<br>
of jewelry and ornaments.	"•<br>

The present invention describes a synthetic fire opal for use in jewelry and ornaments and a process for preparation thereof.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the main raw materials used for the preparation of the synthetic fire opal are a precursor for silicon, a catalyst, a solvent and at least one inorganic salt. TEOS is used as a precursor for silicon. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS), tetramethoxysilane (TMS), tetraethoxysilane (TES) and the like may also be used as precursors for silicon instead of TEOS. TEOS undergoes hydrolysis and condensation<br>
reaction to form soluble metal hydroxides, which ultimately leads to the formation of<br>
continuous (-Si-O-Si-) linkages in an inorganic network that spans throughout the solvent<br>
i<br>
medium. Absolute ethanol of 99.9% purity is used as a solvent in the process. Distilled water is required for hydrolysis of TEOS in the process. Concentrated nitric acid is used as a catalyst in the process. The assay concentration of nitric acid is 68 to 72%. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that other catalysts like HCI, ammonia, and glacial acetic acid etc., may also be used as catalysts without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Various inorganic salts of copper, cobalt, nickel, and iron are used as dopants to obtain synthetic fire opal of different colors. For example, salt of iron may be used to obtain an orange synthetic fire opal; salt of cobalt may be used to obtain a pink synthetic fire opal; another salt of cobalt may be used to obtain a red synthetic fire opal; salt of nickel may be used to obtain a green synthetic fire opal; salt of iron may be used to obtain a yellow synthetic fire opal; and salt of copper may be used to obtain a blue synthetic fire opal. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that it is a cation in the inorganic salt that is responsible for the color of synthetic fire opals. The inorganic salts in the present invention may have any anion, i.e., nitrate, chlorate, carbonate, sulphate, and the like.<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating the process of preparation of a synthetic fire opal for use in jewelry and ornaments in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step 102, hydrolysis of TEOS is carried out in a.closed container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure to obtain a clear sol. This step is described in detail in conjunction with FIG. 2. At step 104, the clear sol obtained at step 102 is stored at room temperature in a closed cupboard for 9, period of 5 to 10 days and is transformed into wet gel. At step 106, the wet gelobtained at step 104 is dried at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 100°C to obtain a colored and transparent material. In an embodiment of the present invention the colored and transparent material is a dry gel. This step is described in detail in conjunction with FIG. 3. At step 108, the colored and transparent material obtained at step 106 is sintered, i.e., further heat treated, at temperatures ranging from 250°C to 800°C to obtain a colored, jiard, and transparent synthetic fire opal. This step is described in detail in conjunctipn with FIG. 4.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in mixing of raw materials to obtain a clear sol in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step 202, absolute ethanol (99.9%), distilled water, concentrated nitric acid, and at least one inorganic salt (selected in accordance with the desired final color as described above) are mixed in a closed container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. At step 204, the mixture of step 202 is vigorously stirred for 1 to 10 hours by using a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous reaction mixture. At step 206, TEOS is carefully added to the homogeneous reaction mixture of step 204 to obtain a clear sol. The mixing and stirring, as described above, results in the hydrolysis of TEOS.<br>
The clear sol obtained after the hydrolysis of TEOS is stored at room temperature. In an embodiment of the present invention the clear sol is stored in a closed cupboard for a period of 5 to 10 days. After 5 to 10 days, the clear sol is transformed into wet gel, which is used for further processing.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in drying a wet gel to obtain a colored and transparent material in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step 302, the wet gel obtained is dried in a laboratory furnace at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 100°C. At step 304, the temperature at which the drying is done is maintained till a colored and transparent material is obtained. In an embodiment of the present invention the colored and transparent material is a dry gel.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating the steps involved in sintering the dried gel to obtain a synthetic fire opal in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. At step 402, the colored and transparent material obtained as a result of drying the wet gel (as shown in FIG. 3) is further heat treated at temperatures ranging from 250°C to 800°C. At this step, the organic part of the colored and transparent material gets removed. Also, at this step, most of the water is removed from tlhe colored and transparent material to prevent crazing. At step 404, the temperature at which the sintering is done is maintained till a colored, transparent and hard synthetic fire opal is obtained. The colored, transparent and hard synthetic fire opal is used in jewelry and ornaments.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a synthetic fire1 opal without any water content is obtained. In the process described above, the colored and transparent material obtained at step 304 is further heat sintered at temperatures beyond 1000°C to obtain a synthetic fire opal without any water content.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the wet gel obtained at step 104 is subjected to supercritical drying in an autoclave to obtain a synthetic fire opal without any water content.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a synthetic common opal is obtained. The common opal is translucent to opaque without play-of-color. Further, the synthetic common opal so prepared may be of any color i.e. pink, green, and blue and the like. The synthetic common opal may also be colorless.<br>
Exemplary Embodiment<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, absolute ethanol (99.9%), distilled water, concentrated nitric acid and salt of iron are mixed in a closed container at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The mixture is vigorously stirred for 1 to 10 hours using a magnetic stirrer to obtain a homogeneous reaction mixture. TEOS is carefully added to the homogeneous reaction mixture to obtain a clear sol. The mixing and stirring, as described above, results in the hydrolysis of TEOS.<br>
The clear sol obtained after the hydrolysis of TEOS is stored at room temperature in a closed cupboard for a period of 5 to 10 days. After 5 to 10 days, the clear sol is transformed into wet gel, which is used for further processing.<br>
The wet gel thus obtained is dried in a laboratory furnace at temperatures ranging from 50°C to 100°C to obtain an orange transparent material.<br>
*i<br>
The orange transparent material obtained as a result of drying the gel is sintered i.e., further heat treated at temperatures ranging from 250°C to.800°C. During this process organic part of the orange transparent material gets removed and the water<br>
content is also reduced to prevent crazing. The final product obtained is an orange, transparent and hard synthetic fire opal for use in jewelry and ornaments.<br>
The orange synthetic fire opal has the same chemical composition and physical properties as a natural fire opal. The synthetic fire opal has the hardness of 5.5 to 6.5 on Mho's scale, water content of at least 2%, refractive index of 1.37 to 1.47 and specific gravity of 1.98 to 2,20 as the natural fire opal. The process for the preparation of the orange synthetic fire opal takes about 4 to 6 weeks. Further, the process for preparation of the orange synthetic fire opal in the present invention is not affected by the particle size of the raw material. The orange synthetic fire opal is more stable and does not show crazing.
