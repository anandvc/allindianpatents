				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an injection device with a rotating valve for the<br>
processing of fusible materials, for example, for example thermoplastics, ceramic<br>
or metallic compositions or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Processing plants of this type are known, for example, as injection-moulding or<br>
alternatively extrusion plants for the area of plastic processing plants and as<br>
injection-moulding plants for ceramic and metallic compositions. In this principle<br>
of moulding production, mould cavities formed correspondingly to the mouldings<br>
to be produced are filled with melt. The injection unit here is part of the hot<br>
channel, through which the melt is conveyed at low or high pressure at the<br>
processing temperature necessary for the particular substance, and enters the<br>
mould cavity via nozzles. In order to ensure high product quality, i.e. both<br>
adequate strength throughout the moulding and optical uniformity, it is<br>
necessary to achieve intimate mixing of the melt streams at the flow lines, i.e.<br>
the points in the moulding where the previously separate melt streams meet one<br>
another again. To this end, it is already known to set the individual melt strands<br>
in vibration or pulsation, at least in sections, causing the melts to penetrate<br>
through in the region of the flow lines owing to the vibration differences and the<br>
flow lines to undergo intensive bonding to one another at the joint of the melt<br>
strands (DE 100 52 841 Al). This publication also describes a plastics processing<br><br>
plant with a plastics injection-moulding machine, an injection-moulding tool<br>
having a cavity for the injection mould and at least two injection valves, each<br>
with a control mechanism, for corresponding injection nozzles opening into the<br>
cavity. The valves can be opened or closed by the control mechanism,<br>
independently of the injection pressure, with the control mechanism of the<br>
individual valves being synchronized with one another. The simplest form of<br>
valve is a valve needle having an inclined groove arranged on its outer surface.<br>
However, the use, likewise described, of rotary slides with roller bearings and T-<br>
shaped control channels is more favourable from a functional point of view. The<br>
disadvantage of these solutions consists in the relatively high complexity required<br>
by this injection unit. After all, pressure of up to 3000 bar prevail in the injection<br>
unit. The rotating valve needles or rotary slides must be sealed off from the<br>
casing, which in turn makes the injection unit more expensive. In addition, there<br>
is the complexity for synchronization, which in all cases requires a gearbox. Also<br>
disadvantageous is the space requirement for this design. The spatial capacity in<br>
the hot channel is limited. Finally, mention should be made of the complexity for<br>
thermal insulation, which in each case has to be operated for two rotating parts.<br>
US4242073 discloses an injection molding apparatus and molding method. The<br>
apparatus comprising a resin plasticizing injection machine having an injection<br>
nozzle, a branch portion connected to the injection nozzle and having a plurality<br>
of outlet ports, molds and mold clamping devices both arranged around the<br>
branch portion in corresponding relation to the outlet ports, and an extension<br>
nozzle for maintaining each of the outlet ports in communication with each of the<br>
molds. Pressure control means is provided at an intermediate portion of the<br><br>
extension nozzle for maintaining the mold cavity at a specified pressure after<br>
resin has been injected into the mold. Means is provided for closing a flow<br>
channel extending from the injection machine to the pressure control means.<br>
After resin has been injected into a mold, the cavity of the mold can be<br>
maintained at the specified pressure by the pressure control means in place of<br>
the injection machine, so that the injection machines and the next mold can be<br>
subsequently brought into operation. Preferably resin is injected into one mold<br>
after another in succession in such a manner that the first mold is prepared for<br>
the injection of resin again before the injection machine is made ready for the<br>
injection into the first mold after completing the injection of resin into all the<br>
molds. The flow channel closing means comprises a shutoff valve mounted on<br>
each of the extension nozzles. The branch portion may comprise a branch valve<br>
for selectively opening or closing the flow channel.<br>
JP - 05 - 337990 discloses an injection molding equipment in which the fused<br>
resin is first supplied to a metallic mold which is set in a metallic mold cavity of<br>
the equipment which solidifies the resin while applying shearing force in part at<br>
least. The molding equipment is characterized by the metallic mold, which<br>
applies the shearing force. The metallic mold having two or more valves, which<br>
can open or close a cavity, four or more hot runner which are open for free<br>
passages.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The injection unit according to the invention with the features of the invention<br>
reduces the complexity for sealing, thermal insulation and drive on a channel<br>
system supplying only one rotating component per mould cavity. In addition,<br>
synchronization of the rotation of two valve needles or rotary slides which supply<br>
the same mould cavity with melt is necessary. This has been achieved by a<br>
design in which the melt enters a rotating hollow spindle directly and passes<br>
from this through at least one distribution channel which runs radially outwards,<br>
to the nozzles opening into the mould cavity. This means that only one rotating<br>
valve element, i,e. a hollow spindle, is provided for each of the associated melt<br>
strands, i.e. for the melt strands which form a channel system and are combined<br>
again in one and the same mould cavity. The hollow spindle thus has two jobs,<br>
namely transportation of the melt flow to at least two channels, and interruption<br>
of the melt flow in order to generate the pulsation. It is of course also<br>
conceivable for a plurality of channel systems to be supplied by one hollow<br>
spindle. It is unimportant here whether the channel systems supply one or more<br>
mould cavities with melt.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the hollow spindle<br>
has two distribution channels which run radially outwards and are not arranged<br>
at the same angle to one another as the feed channels intended to supply then<br>
with melt. If, for example, the two channels are located precisely opposite one<br>
another, the angle between the two distribution channels must not be 180° in<br><br>
order that the filling of the two channels takes place successively in terms of<br>
time. The arrangement of more than one distribution channel has the advantage<br>
that the pulsation frequently can be increased without changing the rotational<br>
speed of the hollow spindle.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, the<br>
distribution channels are arranged at levels of the hollow spindle which lie one<br>
above the other, even if the channels are arranged one on top of the other.<br>
Further advantages and advantageous embodiments of the invention are<br>
revealed by the following example description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 - shows a cross section through an injection unit in the reverse<br>
installation position.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in fig. 1 the injection unit serves on the nozzle side as platen for an<br>
injection-moulding machine. It consists of a platen 1 and an intermediate plate 2,<br>
which are firmly connected to one another by means of guide columns 3 and cap<br><br>
screws 4. The injection unit is thermally insulated from the adjacent parts of the<br>
injection-moulding machine by means of an insulation plate 5. In the present<br>
depiction, the mould cavity (not depicted in greater detail), into which two feed<br>
channels 6 and 7 open, follows below the intermediate plate 2. A heating block<br>
8, which is held at the melting point by heating cartridges 9 and 10, is located in<br>
the interior of the intermediate plate 2. The central constituent of the injection<br>
unit is a hollow spindle 11, which is guided in the heating block 8 by means of a<br>
wear sleeve 12 and a bearing ring 13. In the region of the platen 1, a chain<br>
wheel is connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the hollow spindle 11 via a<br>
tongue-and-groove joint. The bearing of hollow spindle 11 and chain wheel 14 in<br>
the platen 1 takes place by means of a bearing plate 15 and groove ball bearings<br>
16. The hollow spindle 11 has an additional guide in the transition region from<br>
the platen 1 to the intermediate plate 2 through a guide sleeve 17, a support<br>
ring 18 and a wear ring 19. The cavity of the hollow spindle 11 is connected to<br>
the pressure channel of the injection-moulding machine so that the melt enters<br>
the latter. In the present sectional depiction, this is indicated by the pressure<br>
channel 20, which, after a short axial guide, becomes a radial distribution<br>
channel 21.<br>
The mode of action of the invention will be described in greater detail below. The<br>
chain wheel 14 and thus also the hollow spindle 11 is, in the present example,<br>
driven by means of a chain (not shown) of a gear motor (likewise not shown).<br>
The distribution channel 21 of the hollow spindle 11 thus alternately connects 6<br>
and 7 to the pressure channel 20, so that the melt stream divided into two<br><br>
partial melt streams, enters the mould cavity in a pulsed manner. The hollow<br>
spindle 11 accordingly has a double function, namely that of distribution of the<br>
melt over at least two feed channels and generation of the pulsation. In the<br>
present example, the hollow spindle 11 has only one radial distribution channel<br>
21, i.e. during a rotation of the hollow spindle 11, each of the feed channels 6<br>
and 7 is also only connected to the pressure channel 20 once. The pulsation<br>
frequency of a feed channel 6;7 accordingly corresponds to the rotational speed<br>
of the hollow spindle 11, with the pressure pulses in each case being phase-<br>
shifted by 180°. If more than one distribution channel 21 is provided in a plane,<br>
these must always be at a different angle to one another than the feed channels<br>
6;7 located in this plane, i.e. it must be ensured that, whenever a feed channel<br>
6;7 is just connected to the pressure channel 20, the other is closed by the<br>
envelope of the hollow spindle 11.<br>
All features represented in the description, the following claims and the drawing<br>
can be essential to the invention, both individually and in any desired<br>
combination with one another.<br><br>
