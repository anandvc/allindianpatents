				<td>HETEROCYCLIC INHIBITORS OF MEK AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
[0001] . This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/523,270, filed November 19,2003, incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to a series of novel heterocyclic compounds that are<br>
useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer and inflammation, in mammals. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
2.	Description of the state of the art<br>
[0003]	Cell signaling through growth factor receptors and protein kinases is an<br>
important regulator of cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, In  normal cell growth, growth factors, through receptor activation (i.e. PDGF or EGF and others), activate MAP kinase pathways. One of the most important and most well understood MAP kinase pathways involved in normal and uncontrolled cell growth is the Ras/Raf Kinase pathway. Active GTP-bound Ras results in the activation and indirect phosphorylation of Raf kinase. Raf then phosphorylates MEK1 and 2 on two serine residues (S218 and S222 for MEK1 and S222and S226 for MEK2) (Ahn et al, Methods in Enzymology, 2001, 352, 417-431). Activated MEK then phosphorylates its only known substrates, the MAP kinases, ERK1 and 2. ERK phosphorylation by MEK occurs on Y204 and T202 for ERK1 and Y185 and T183 for ERK2 (Ahn et al, Methods in Enzymology, 2001, 332, 417-431). Phosphorylated ERK dimerizes and then translocates to the nucleus where it accumulates (Khokhlatchev et al, Cell, 1998, 93, 605-615). In the nucleus, ERK is involved in several important cellular functions, including but not limited to nuclear transport, signal transduction, DNA repair, nucleosome assembly and translocation, and mRNA processing and translation (Ahn et al, Molecular Cell, 2000, 6, 1343-1354). Overall, treatment of cells with growth factors leads to the activation of ERK1 and 2 which results in proliferation and, in some cases, differentiation (Lewis et al,Adv. Cancer Res., 1998, 74,49-139).<br><br>
[0004]	In proliferative diseases, genetic mutations and/or overexpression of the<br>
grow factor receptors, downstream signaling proteins, or protein kinases involved in the ERK kinase pathway lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and, eventually, tumor formation. For example, some cancers contain mutations which result in the continuous activation of this pathway due to continuous production of growth factors. Other mutations can lead to defects in the deactivation of the activated GTP-bound Ras complex, again resulting in activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in 50% of colon and &gt;90% pancreatic cancers as well as many others types of cancers (Kohl et al, Science, 1993, 260, 1834-1837). Recently, bRaf mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanoma (Davies, H. et al. Nature, 2002, 417, 949-954). These mutations in bRaf result in a constitutively active MAP kinase cascade. Studies of primary tumor samples and cell lines have also shown constitutive or overactivation of the MAP kinase pathway in cancers of pancreas, colon, lung, ovary and kidney (Hoshino, R. et al., Oncogene, 1999,18, 813-822). Hence, there is a strong correlation between cancers and an overactive MAP kinase pathway resulting from genetic mutations.<br>
[0005]	As constitutive or overactivation of MAP kinase cascade plays a pivotal<br>
role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed to be<br>
beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases. MEK is a key player in this pathway as it is<br>
downstream of Ras and Raf. Additionally, it is an attractive therapeutic target because<br>
the only known substrates for MEK phosphorylation are the MAP kinases, ERK1 and 2.<br>
Inhibition of MEK has been shown to have potential therapeutic benefit in several studies.<br>
For example, small molecule MEK inhibitors have been shown to inhibit human tumor<br>
growth in nude mouse xenografts, (Sebolt-Leopold et al., Nature-Medicine, 1999, 5 (7),<br>
810-816; Trachet et al., AACR April 6-10, 2O02, Poster #5426; Tecle, H., BBC 2nd<br>
International Conference of Protein Kinases, September 9-10, 2002), block static<br>
allodynia in animals (WO 01/05390 published January 25, 2001) and inhibit growth of<br>
acute myeloid leukemia cells (Milella et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2001,108 (6), 851-859).<br>
[0006]	Small molecule inhibitors of MEK have been disclosed, including in U.S.<br>
Patent Publication Nos. 2003/0232869, 2004/0116710, and 2003/0216460, and U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 10/654,580 and 10/929,295, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. At least fifteen additional patent applications have appeared in<br><br>

number of similar moieties falling within the scope of the definitions of R4 and R5.<br>
[00171]	The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric<br>
centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enanriomers, diastereomers mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. Accordingly, this invention also includes all such isomers, including diastereomeric mixtures and resolved enantiomers of the Formulas I-V. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomer mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition, J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992).<br>
[00172]	This invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
a compound of Formula I-V and methods of treating proliferative disorders, or abnormal cell growth, by administering compounds of the present invention. Compounds of the present invention having free amino, amido, hydroxy or carboxylic groups can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs.<br>
[00173]	A "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug" is a compound that may be<br>
converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to the specified compound or to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of such compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) ammo acid residues is covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy or carboxylic acid group of compounds of the present invention. The amino acid residues include but are not limited to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids commonly designated by three letter symbols and also includes 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvaline, beta-alanine, gamma-aniinobutyric acid, cirtulline, homocysteine, homoserine, omithine and methionine sulfone. One preferred prodrug of this invention is a compound of Formula I-V covalently joined to a valine residue.<br>
[00174]	Additional types of prodrugs are also encompassed.   For instance, free<br>
carboxyl groups can be derivatized as amides or alkyl esters. As another example,<br>
compounds of this invention comprising free hydroxy groups may be derivatized as<br>
prodrugs by converting the hydroxy group to a phosphate ester, hemisuccinates<br>
dimethylaminoacetate, or phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyl, as outlined in Advanced<br>
Drug Delivery Reviews, 1996, 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino<br>
groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs, sulfonate esters and sulfate esters of<br>
hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and<br>
(acyloxy)ethyl ethers wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted<br>
with groups including but not limited to ether, amine and carboxylic acid functionalities,<br>
or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, are also encompassed.<br>
Prodrugs of this type are described in J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, 10. More specific<br>
examples include replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group<br>
such as (Ci -C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, l-((Ci -C6)allcanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-l-((Ci-<br>
C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,	(Ci-C6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl,	N-(Cp<br>
C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (Ci-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(Ci -C4)alkanoyl, aryUfcyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl, where each cc-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, -P(O)(0(Ci-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).<br>
[00175]	Free   amines   can   also   be   derivatized  as   amides,   sulfonamides   or<br>
phosphonamides. For example, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (d -Cio)alkyl, (C3-C7)cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural a-aminoacyl or natural .alpha.-aminoacyl-natural a-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY wherein Y is H, (d -C6)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY0)Y! wherein YO is (Ci -C4) alkyl and YI is (Ct -C6)aUcyl, carboxy(Ci -C6)allcyl, amino(Ci-C4)alkyl or mono-N- or di-N,N- (Ci -C6)alkylaminoalkyl, -C(Y2)Y3 wherein Y2 is H or methyl and Ya is mono-N- or di-N,N-(Ci -C6)alkylamino, morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-<br>

[00179]	A "pharmaceutically active metabolite" is a pharmacologically active<br>
product produced through metabolism in the body of a specified compound or salt<br>
thereof. Metabolites of a compound may be identified using routine techniques known in<br>
the art and their activities determined using tests such as those described herein.<br>

[00185]	Illustrations of the preparation of compounds of the present invention are<br>
shown in Figures 1-34.<br>
[00186]	Figure 1 illustrates synthesis of compounds of Formula I. Pyridone ester 2<br>
can be prepared in a two step one-pot procedure. Treatment of 3-oxo-pentanedioic acid<br>
diethyl ester 1 with triethyl orthoformate and acetic acid at elevated temperatures (120 to<br>
150 °C) gives the intermediate enol ether. Cyclization of the enol ether intermediate can<br>
then be accomplished by cooling the concentrated reaction residue and treating with the<br>
appropriate amine at low temperature (about 0 °C). Halogenation of the pyridone ester 2<br>
can be accomplished with POC13, thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, PCls, PBr3, or Ph3P<br>
and Br2. Preferably this transformation is achieved with POCls neat or in the presence of<br>
an amine like triethylamine at room temperature. If R9 is Cl or F, it can be incorporated<br>
at this stage. Chlorination of pyridone ester 3 can be accomplished with NCS in a<br>
suitable organic solvent such as DMF, MeCN or mixed solvent systems at room<br>
temperature. Preferably the reaction is carried out in DMF. Fluorination is achieved by<br>
treating pyridone	ester 3 with [l-(chloromethyl)-4-fluoro-l,4-<br>
diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-bis(tetrafluoroborate) in the presence of base in a suitable<br><br>
organic solvent at the appropriate temperature. Most preferable is the use of LiOH as baseWi MeCN as solvent at approximately 85 °C.<br>
[00187]	With continued reference to Figure 1, regardless of the identity of R ,<br>
pyridone acid 4 can be prepared by basic hydrolysis under standard conditions using either LiOH or NaOH in standard mixed aqueous/organic solvent systems. Incorporation of the aniline moiety is accomplished by SuAr reaction. This can be done in a suitable organic solvent such as THF using an amide base such as LDA, LiHMDS, NaHMDS or KHMDS at appropriate temperatures (-78 °C to room temperature). Preferably, the aniline is added to LDA or LiHMDS in THF at low temperature (-20 to -80 °C). The pyridone 4 is then added and the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature to generate carboxylic acid 5. Amides 6 and hydroxamates 7 can be prepared using standard coupling procedures, including but not limited to EDCI, HOBt, or PyBOP and the appropriate amine or hydroxylamine in suitable organic solvents such as DMF, THF or methylene chloride. In some instances, the amine or hydroxylamine used in the coupling reaction contains a standard protecting group. In those cases, the protecting group can be removed by standard conditions known in the art.<br>
[00188]	Figure 2 outlines the synthesis of compounds of Formula I wherein the R9<br>
group is incorporated into the starting 3-oxopentanedioic acid diethyl ester 8. This route is particularly useful for analogs where R9 is alkyl. The preparation of analog 10 is outlined in Figure 2 and can be carried out as described above for Figure 1 with the addition that activation of pyridone 9 can be accomplished by conversion to a triflate ester. This can be done by treating pyridone 9 with triflic anhydride or N-phenyltrifluoromethanesulfoniniide and amine base in THF or methylene chloride. When Z is Cl or Br, pyridone 10 can be converted to amide 6 or hydroxmate 7 as described in Figure 1. Alternatively, pyridone 10 can be converted to hydroxamate 7 in the route outlined in Figure 2 in which the aniline moiety is incorporated utilizing palladium mediated cross coupling chemistry. The palladium mediated cross coupling chemistry can be accomplished by treatment of a mixture of the appropriate aniline and pyridone 10 with a Pd catalyst such as Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2(dppf), Pd(Ph3P)4, Pd2dba3, a phosphine ligand and base in a suitable organic solvent such as THF, DMF, PhMe, DME or MeCN at elevated temperature. Most preferably, Pd(OAc)2, rac-2,2-bis(diphenyIphosphino)-l,l'-binaphthyl and Cs2CO3 are used in PhMe at 70 to 100 °C. Hydroxamate 7 can be<br>
prepared by treating pyridone ester 11 with the appropriate hydroxylamine and amide<br>
bas% such as LDA, LiHMDS or NaHMDS in a suitable organic solvent such as THF at<br>
low temperature. Preferably, a LiHMDS solution is added to a solution of pyridone ester<br>
11 and hydroxylamine in THF at 0 °C. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room<br>
temperature to yield the desired hydroxamate 7. In some instances, the hydroxylamine<br>
used in the coupling reaction contains a standard protecting group. In those cases, the<br>
protecting group can be removed by standard conditions known in the art.<br>

The first step is S&gt;jAr addition of the properly substituted aniline in a suitable organic solvent such as THF using an amide base such as LDA, LiHMDS, NaHMDS or KHMDS at appropriate temperatures (-78 °C to room temperature). Preferably, the aniline is added to LDA or LiHMDS hi THF at low temperature (-20 to -80 °C). The nicotinic acid 12 is then added and the reaction mixture wanned to room temperature to generate the corresponding carboxylic acid. The methyl ester 13 can then be prepared by standard conditions including but not limited to TMSC1 in MeOH or TMSCHN: in suitable organic solvents such as PhMe/MeOH. Pyridone 14 can be made in a two-step sequence. In the first step, methyl ester 13 is treated with sodium methoxide in a suitable organic solvent such as MeOH or THF or MeOH/THF mixtures at temperatures ranging from 0 °C to 40 °C. Preferably, sodium methoxide is added to a solution of methyl ester 13 in MeOH/THF at 0 °C. This mixture is then warmed to room temperature and then to 40 °C to generate the desired methoxy pyridine. Demethylation can then be accomplished by standard conditions including but not limited to aqueous HC1 at elevated temperature, pTsOH in acetic acid at elevated temperature and aqueous HBr in MeOH at elevated temperature. Preferably demethylation to give pyridone 14 is achieved by treatment of the methoxy pyridine with HBr in acetic acid at elevated temperature (80 to 120 °C). If desired, alkylation of pyridone 14 to give substituted pyridone 15 can be achieved by standard basic alkylation conditions incorporating alkyl halides. These conditions include but are not limited to K2CO3 in acetone or DMF, NaH in THF or, NaOMe in MeOH/PhMe or, phase transfer conditions using for example NaOH and BmNI. Preferably, the alkylation is accomplished by treatment of pyridone 14 with LiH at 0 °C<br>
in DMF followed by addition of alkyl bromide and warming to room temperature. S&amp;boxylic acid 15 can then be prepared using standard saponification conditions such as LiOH or NaOH in standard mixed aqueous/organic solvent systems. Pyridone 15 can be converted to amide 6 or hydroxmate 7 as described in Figure 1.<br>
[00190]	Figure 4 describes the initial steps in the preparation of analogs of<br>
compounds of the Formula I. Treatment of 3-oxopentanedioic acid diethyl ester 8 with a ketene acetal and acetic acid at elevated temperatures (120 to 150 °C) gives the intermediate enol ether. Cyclization of the enol ether intermediate can then be accomplished by cooling the concentrated reaction residue and treating with the appropriate amine at low temperature (about 0 °C) to give pyridone 16. If R9 is Cl or F is desired, then a chlorination or fluorination step as described in Figure 1 can be incorporated at this tune. Furthermore, pyridone 16 can be converted to amide 6 or hydroxamate 7 through the S^Ai chemistry as described in Figure 1 or through palladium mediated cross-coupling chemistry as described in Figure 2.<br>

Bromination of pyridone 17 (prepared as described in Figures 2 and 4) to give pyridone 18 can be accomplished using standard conditions such as NBS in a suitable organic solvent. Cyclization to form lactam 19 can be achieved by treatment with ammonia or a primary amine in a suitable organic solvent at temperatures ranging from ambient to slightly elevated. Preferably, this Cyclization is accomplished in an alcoholic solvent such as MeOH or EtOH. Pyridone 18 can also be converted to pyridazinones 20 and 21 by treatment with substituted or unsubstituted hydraziiies or t-butyl carbazate in a suitable organic solvent such as DMF, THF, MeOH or EtOH.

nicotinic acid 52 by SwAR reaction. This can be done in a suitable organic solvent such<br>
as THF using an amide base such as LDA, LiHMDS, NaHMDS, or KHMDS at<br>
appropriate temperatures (-78 °C to room temperature. Preferably the aniline is added to<br>
LDA or LiHMDS in THF at low temperature (-20 to -80 °C). Nicotinic acid 52 is then<br>
added and the mixture is stirred at low temperature to generate the coupled product.<br>

including but not limited to Fisher esterification (MeOH, H2SO4), TMSC1 in MeOH or<br>
TMSCHN2 in suitable organic solvents such as PhMe/MeOH. Pyridone 54 can be made<br>

in a suitable organic solvent such as MeOH or THF or MeOH/THF mixtures at<br>
temperatures ranging from 0 °C to reflux. Preferably, sodium methoxide is added to a<br>
solution of methyl ester 59 in MeOH at room temperature. This mixture is then refluxed<br>
for 4 days to generate the desired methoxy pyridine. Demethylation of the methoxy<br>
pyridine can then be accomplished by standard conditions including but not limited to<br>
HC1 at elevated temperature, pTsOH in acetic acid at elevated temperature and aqueous<br>
HBr in MeOH at elevated temperature. Preferable demethylation to give pyridone 54 is<br>
achieved by treatment of the methoxy pyridine with aqueous HBr in acetic acid at<br>
elevated temperature (80 to 120 °C). Carboxylic acid 55, as well as hydroxamate 56 and<br>

Conversion of 60 to carboxylic acid 55, as well as hydroxamate 56 and amide 57 (where R9 is Br) can be accomplished as described for Figures 15 and/or 16. Conversion of bromide 60 to compounds of Formula V where R9 is aryl, heteroaryl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, amino and anilino can be achieved using Pd mediated cross-coupling conditions. When R9 is alkenyl or alkynyl, these can be further reduced using the appropriate reducing agent to provide alkyl substituents at R9. In general, this chemistry can be accomplished using a wide variety of Pd catalysts and ligands, with or without added base, in a suitable organic solvent such as DMF, PhMe, DME, THF, CH3CN at elevated temperature. The coupling partner will depend on the nature of R . These Pd mediated cross-couplings are well documented in the literature and are known by anyone skilled in the art.

Formation of 61 can then be accomplished by incorporation of the properly substituted aniline moiety into bromide 67 by SNAR reaction. This can be done in a suitable organic solvent such as THF using an amide base such as LDA, LiHMDS, NaHMDS, or KHMDS at appropriate temperatures (-78 °C to room temperature. Preferably the aniline is added to LDA or LiHMDS in THF at low temperature (-20 to -80 °C). Bromide 67 is then added and the mixture is stirred at low temperature to generate the coupled product 61.<br>

The reaction was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in water and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash column chromatography (60:40 hexanes:EtOAc) removed starting material. The partially purified ethyl ester was then hydrolyzed by dissolving in 4:1 THF:MeOH (10 mL) followed by treatment with 1 M LiOH solution (2.8 ml.). After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 1 with 10% HC1 solution and extracted with EtOAc.

[00356]	Preparation     of     4-hvdroxv-1.5-dimethyl-6-oxo-1.6-dihvdropvridine-3-<br>
carboxylic acid ethyl ester: Triethyl orthoformate (3.85 mL, 23.12 mmol) and acetic anhydride (4.37 mL, 46.25 mmol) were added to 2-methyl-3-oxo-pentanedioic acid diethyl ester (Caliskan et al Aiist. J. Chem. 1999, 52 (11), 1013-1020) (5.0 g, 23.1 mmol) and the reaction mixture heated to 135 °C. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was cooled to 0 °C and methylamine (40% in water, 5.0 mL, 57.81 mmol) was added with stirring. Water (20 mL) was added and the reaction mixture stirred for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the aqueous layer acidified to pH 2 with 10% aqueous HC1. The acidified aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSCU) and concentrated to give a solid. Trituration with diethyl ether yielded 4.88 g (55%) clean desired product. 4-Hydroxy-l,5-dimethyl-6-oxo-l,6-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester was carried forward as described in Example 1, Steps B - D.

dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid<br>
[00384]	Step   A:   Preparation   of  4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenYlamnoV6-chloro-5-<br>
fluoro-nicotinic acid:     nBuLi (14.7 mL, 36.7 mmol, 2.5 M solution in hexanes) was<br>
added to a stirred solution of diisopropylamine (5.15 mL, 36.7 mmol) in THF (20 mL) at O^C. After 20 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled to -78 °C and a solution of 4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamine (4.65 g, 24.5 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added. After 20 minutes, a solution of 4,6-dichloro-5-fluoro-nicotinic acid (Sanchez et al J Heterocylc. Chem. 1993, 30 (4), 855-9) (2.57 g, 12.25 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added. After 10 minutes, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour. After quenching the reaction mixture with 10% HC1 (20 mL), it was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO^t) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Trituration with methylene chloride yielded 3.21 g (72%) of clean desired product.<br>
[00385]	Step  B:     Preparation  of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylaminoV6-chloro-5-<br>
fluoro-nicotinic acid methyl ester: A hexanes solution of TMSCH2N2 (9.46 mL, 18,9 mmol) was added to 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino)-6-chloro-5-fluoro-nicotinic acid (4.59g, 12.62 mmol) in a solution of 3:1 THF:MeOH (48 mL) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 hour. After quenching with AcOH, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and water. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with water, saturated NaHCO3 solution and brine. The organic layer was dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to give 4.40 g (92%) clean desired product.<br>
[00386]	Step   C:     Preparation  of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenvlaminoV5-fiuoro-6-<br>
methoxv-nicotinic acid methyl ester: Sodium methoxide (2.20 g, 40.8 mmol) was slowly<br>
added to a stirred solution of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino)-6-chloro-5-fluoro-<br>
nicotinic acid methyl ester in 4:1 MeOH:THF (20 mL) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture was<br>
warmed to room temperature, stirred for 17 hours and then warmed to 40 °C and stirred<br>
for 5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was quenched with<br>
water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried<br>
(MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The desired product, contaminated<br>
with some starting material, was carried forward without purification.<br>
[00387]	Step D: Preparation of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenvlaminoV5-fluoro-6-oxo-<br>
L6-dihvdropvridine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester: Hydrobromic acid (5.S2 mL, 51.5 mmol) was added to a mixture of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino)-5-fluoro-6-methoxy-nicotinic acid methyl ester (0.64 g, 1.72 mmol) and acetic acid (5.9 mL, 103 mmol). The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 20 minutes and then cooled to room temperature.<br>
Vv<br>
After water was added to the mixture, a white precipitate formed. The white solid was collected by filtered and washed with water and diethyl ether to yield 0.60 g (97%) clean desired product.<br>
[00388]	Step E: Preparation of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenvlaminoV5-fluoro-6-oxo-<br>
l-pvridin-3-vhnethvl-1.6-dihvdropvridine-3-carboxvlic acid: Lithium hydride (14 mg, 1.64 mniol) was added to a stirred solution of 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino)-5-fluoro-6-oxo-l,6-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylic acid methyl ester (0.190 g, 0.529 inmol) in DMF (5 mL) at 0 °C. After stirring for 30 minutes, 3-bromomethyl-pyridine hydrobromide (0.14 g, 0.53 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 16 hours. After quenching with ice water, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried (MgSC^) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by flash column chromatography (1% MeOH in methylene chloride) yielded 4-(4-bromo-2-fluorophenylamino)-5 -fiuoro-6-oxo-1 -pyridin-3 -ylmethyl-1,6-dihydropyridine-3 -carboxylic acid methyl ester. The methyl ester was dissolved in 4:1 THF:MeOH (5 mL) and 1 M LiOH solution (1.1 mL) was added. After 1 hour, the reaction mixture was acidified to pH 1 with 10% aqueous HC1 solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Trituration with diethyl ether gave 0.160 g (69% two step yield) clean desired product.
