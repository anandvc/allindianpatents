				<td>A PROCESS FOR SELECTIVE SEPARATION AND RECOVERY OF HIGH MOLAR MASS LIGNIN FROM BLACK LIQUOR DISCHARGED FROM AGRO-BASED PULP AND PAPER MILLS<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for selective separation and recovery of high molar mass lignin from soda black liquor discharged from paper mills, especially small agro-based paper and pulp mills. In particular, the present invention relates to selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills, to render such black liquor biodegradable and environment friendly. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel process for selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from small agro based pulp and paper mills, so that such mills may operate in a more eco-friendly manner and comply with the prescribed standards for emission. The present invention also relates to a process for the selective separation and recovery of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from small agro based pulp and paper mills for use in various industrial applications. Background of invention<br>
hi the paper making process by pulping of wood, for example by the kraft process, wood chips are digested in a pulping liquor to dissolve out lignin from the wood chips and free the cellulosic fibres so as to form a pulp. Pulping liquor is generally an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide (known as white liquor). The wood pulp is then washed free from pulping chemicals and usually is forwarded to a bleach plant for brightening.<br>
The spent pulping liquor from the pulping operation, known as black liquor, is usually, concentrated and then combusted in a recovery boiler to burn off its carbon content. The concentrated black liquor is then heated with steam to lower its viscosity prior to combustion. The residual mass, known as smelt, is then further processed to form white liquor for recycle to the digestion step.<br>
Since the spent pulping liquor contains sodium sulfide and other sulfur compounds which are themselves malodorous or which form hydrogen sulfide and/or other malodorous sulfur compounds, it is common practice to subject the sulfur-carbon black liquor to oxidation at some selected stage in the<br><br>
sequence, in order to convert the sodium sulfide and/or other sulfur compounds to more stable compounds,<br>
generally sulfates and thiosulfates.<br>
The spent pulping liquor also contains a high quantity of lignin. The presence of high quantity of lignin in the liquor could pose environmental hazards. Therefore, removal of lignin, particularly, the high molar mass factions could achieve the twin advantage of recovery of industrially useful product and also render the effluents discharged from the pulping mills eco-friendly. Description of related art<br>
This oxidation procedure, referred to above, commonly known as BLOX (black liquor oxidation), also involves the evolution of heat. U.S. Pat. No. 4,239,589 proposes a procedure to effect recovery of this heat of reaction. In particular, this prior art locates the BLOX step between the first effect evaporation and the flash tank of the multiple effect concentration used to initially concentrate the dilute black liquor from the pulping operation to about 50% solids concentration.<br>
This prior art also describes conventional BLOX polishing in which the concentrated black liquor is further oxidized to convert any residual oxidizable sulfur compounds to stable form and further concentration of the black liquor to about 65% solids concentration, before feeding to the recovery boiler. This prior art however, stresses more on reducing the toxicity of the effluents than recovery of an industrially useful product.<br>
US Patent No. 5,777,086 granted to Klyosov, et al., discloses a method of recovering lignin from pulp and paper sludge. In particular, this patent discloses a thermochemical process for the use of pulp and paper sludge as a source of lignin through extraction and recovery. Pulp and paper sludge contains common components of plant materials as well as minerals employed in papermaking. Sludge is mixed in an alkaline solution (NaOH 0.4% to 4% by weight, preferably 0.5% to 2%, and most preferably 1% NaOH by weight). The solution is heated in an autoclave at a temperature of 150°C to 250°C. (preferably 180°C to 220°C, and most preferably 200°C.) for a short time, e.g., from about half an hour to an hour. The extracted lignin, present in the alkaline solution, is precipitated by lowering the pH of the solution to a value of 3-5 with the use of, for example, an inorganic or organic acid. The precipitated solid lignin is then recovered and dried.<br><br>
The prior art recognizes that pulp and paper sludge, a byproduct of primary pulping operations,<br>
recycle streams or waste paper pulping and the like, represents an environmental and disposal problem for manufacturers of paper. Generally, pulp and paper sludge is unsuitable for paper making, although it generally includes the same components-lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, calcium carbonate, clay, and other inorganic components—as those present in the paper pulp itself.<br>
Lignin is a well known organic substance, which with cellulose constitutes the essential part of woody plant tissue. It is typically obtained as a byproduct of pulping processes. Lignin is used in a variety of applications ranging from production of vanillin to use as a dispersant (e.g., in concrete admixtures), as a binder (e.g., in animal feed pellets and coal briquettes), and as an emulsifier (e.g., in oil drilling mud additives). As disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,775,744, 4,781,840, 4,787,960, and 4,789,523 chemically modified lignin derivatives have excellent applications as natural adhesives, flocculants, sizing agents, and corrosion inhibitors. Use of various forms of lignin as coagulating and flocculating agents in the treatment of wastewater has also been taught in the prior art for e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,058.<br>
Lignin can be found in the liquor generated during commercial papermaking, which typically involves reduction of wood to a fibrous mass through a series of cooking and bleaching operations using strong chemicals. The two principal chemical pulping methods are the alkaline kraft process and the acidic sulfite process, each producing a different type of extractable lignin. In the more common kraft process, wood chips are cooked in a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide (Na2S). The alkaline treatment causes fragmentation of lignin molecules, whose sodium salts are soluble at high pH. Cooking is typically carried out at a temperature of 170 to 180°C, a pressure of 8 atm, and a total processing time of about 150 minutes under alkaline conditions, the total NaOH and Na2. Being about 16.5%, at a kraft "liquor" pH of 13 or higher. The spent cooking solution, which is referred to as "black liquor", is separated from the cellulosic fibers and typically sent to a recovery device, where the organic components of the liquor, including lignin, are combusted. Usually, kraft black liquor contains 41% alkali lignin, 36% organic acids and lactones, 16% sodium, and 3% sulfur.<br><br>
Separation of lignin from the black liquor is generally not undertaken by the pulping industry due to<br>
the limited quantity of recoverable lignin. Recovery techniques have, however, been attempted, developed, and patented. These techniques typically involve acidification of the solution as suggested in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,111,928, 4,265,809, and 5,034,094.<br>
Also, due to the non availability of technology and viable chemical recovery system in the paper industry, small agro-based pulp and paper mills are discharging their lignin rich black liquor in to the recipient system. By doing so, this category of small agro-based mills not only are draining their resources in the form of lignin but are creating severe problem of pollution. On the other hand, in the large sized integrated paper mills using Kraft pulping process, the lignin rich black liquor is incinerated in chemical recovery furnace and used as an important source of energy.<br>
As taught in this prior art, the sulfite pulping process involves cooking the wood chips in a solution of sulfurous acid (H2 SO3) and bisulfite (HSO3) salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium or ammonium at a cooking temperature of 120 to 135°C. with an excess of the acid, resulting in a liquor pH of 1-2. The "bisulfite" process is carried out at a temperature in the range of 140 to 160°C and moderate acidic conditions, resulting in a liquor pH of 3-5. The sulfite process typically results in sulfonation of lignin, whereby sulfite groups become chemically attached to the lignin molecules. The sulfites combine with the lignin to produce relatively insoluble lignosulfonic acid, which, in the presence of the base, forms more soluble lignosulfonic salts (or lignosulfonates). Under conditions of high acid concentration and/or high temperature, lignin undergoes an undesirable polycondensation, forming a dark-colored and insoluble compound called "burned cook" in the pulp industry. Once again, the spent liquor of the sulfite pulping process is typically burned without recovery of lignin.<br>
When spent pulping liquors are occasionally used for lignin recovery, the species obtained is generally lignosulfonates, which as acknowledged by the prior art, are used primarily for oil-drilling muds and production of vanillin. Owing to the different chemical conditions, lignosulfonates from acidic sulfite liquors are precipitated differently from the alkali lignins present in kraft black liquors. Lignosulfonates have relatively low molecular weights and high sulfur contents; while the molecular weights of alkali lignins vary,<br><br>
the sulfur contents are also relatively high. Sulfur generally limits the commercial usefulness of lignin,<br>
posing toxicity concerns, reduced biodegradability, and reduced ability to undergo certain useful chemical transformations (since sulfur selectively blocks various chemical functional groups and forms extremely tight complexes with some metals).<br>
Lignin is also extracted directly from plant materials, although this is generally not considered commercially feasible. For example, Austrian Patent No. 263,661 discloses a method of hydrothermal pretreatment (so-called hydrothermolysis, or "aquasolv") of wheat straw, in which hot compressed water (180.degree.-220.degree. C. at 1.1-2.4 MPa) led through a biomass-filled reactor in a direct percolation mode extracts 30 to 60% of the plant biomass, i.e., practically all the hemicelluloses and a considerable part of the lignin. The process obtains between 44.4 and 58.0% of lignin initially present in the material. Various subsequent improvements (see, e.g., Austrian Patent No. 398,990) have increased this yield.<br>
US Patent No. 5,777,086 utilizes an alternative source of lignin—pulp and paper sludge—that in fact represents perhaps the most significant disposal burden to paper mills rather than an energy source. Paper mill sludge is generated during the processing of virgin or recycled fiber for the production of paper or cardboard. Pulping or repulping of these materials and processing of the pulp in papermaking machines in the presence of large volumes of water results in carrying away significant amounts of the fiber, fillers, ink, and all other components present in the pulp. In the process of water recycling, the sludge is collected as settleable or floatable solids, pressed to a mass of 40-50% solids, and typically disposed of by landfilling or incineration.<br>
In the stone groundwood (SOW) process, pulp is produced by pressing blocks of wood against an abrasive rotating stone surface. Thermomechanical pulping (TMP) involves steaming wood chips under pressure for a short period of time prior to and during refining. Chemithermomechanical pulping (CTMP) utilizes a modest chemical impregnation (usually with sodium sulfite solution) during the steaming stage. Paper sheets formed from these types of pulp have a relatively high lignin content. When paper is subjected to repulping and the following screening, cleaning, thickening, and other processing steps, typically in the<br><br>
presence of large volumes of water, so-called groundwood paper sludge is collected as settleable or floatable<br>
solids.<br>
During de-inking, for example, at least 10% and as much as 25-30% of the fiber mass is lost, which mixed with process water constitutes de-inked pulp mill sludge. It generally differs in composition from de-inked paper mill sludge that is generated during papermaking and carried away with process water. De-inked paper mill sludge is typically generated either from de-inked pulp, or the latter mixed with virgin pulp, plus ingredients added during the papermaking process. Generally, pulp and paper sludge is unsuitable for papermaking, although it generally includes the same components (lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, calcium carbonate (CaCO.sub.3), clay, and other inorganic fillers) as those present in the paper pulp itself.<br>
The invention disclosed in the US Patent is not only adapted to make use of this waste material as a source of lignin, but also exploits a key component, CaCO3 to assist in the extraction of lignin. The invention of this US patent, accordingly, provides a thermochemical process for the extraction and recovery of lignin from pulp and paper sludge. A major fraction of the lignin recovered pursuant to the disclosure of this patent has an average molecular weight close to one thousand dalton. The remainder has an apparent molecular weight of up to several hundred thousand to a million and higher, and may represent both individual highly polymeric lignin molecules and non-covalent associations of low-molecular weight lignin fragments. The extracted lignin contains less than 1% sulfur and has a higher purity compared with that isolated from kraft black liquor.<br>
The extraction process disclosed in said US patent sludge involves mixing paper sludge in a solution of NaOH--0.4% to 4% by weight, preferably 0.5% to 2%, and most preferably 1% NaOH by weight~the optimal concentration depending on process conditions such as the presence of neutralizing species. The solution is heated in an autoclave at a temperature of 150 to 250°C preferably 180 to 220°C, and most preferably 200 °C for a short time, ranging from about half an hour to one hour.<br>
Recycled paper sludge typically contains a rather high amount of CaCO3 (up to 20%-50% or more). In the presence of NaOH, CaCO3 is converted to calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, in the reaction delignification<br><br>
mixture. CaCOH)2, a strong alkaline agent, facilitates lignin extraction and increases its purity, thereby<br>
upgrading the quality of the lignin produced.<br>
After heating, the mixture is allowed to cool down, and is then acidified to pH 3 to 5 to precipitate the lignin. The precipitate is recovered by sedimentation, filtration, centrifugation, extraction with a water-immiscible organic solvent, or other suitable separation method and can be further dried to a powder form. As is well recognized in the prior art, there are significant drawbacks in more widespread commercial utilization of lignin. Some of them are its limited practical availability for high-value applications and the expense of its recovery. Also, it has always been considered more cost-effective to burn spent process liquor as a source of energy rather than extract lignin. Therefore, while the black liquor is undoubtedly, the most abundant potential source of lignin, in the absence of a commercially viable process, it has rarely been exploited. Another problem is that commercially available lignin preparations, extracted from industrial black liquors, invariably contain a significant amount of sulfur, thus limiting the commercial usefulness of the recovered lignin.<br>
US Patent No. 4,111,928 of Holsopple et al granted on September 1978 discloses a process for separation of lignin from waste black cooking liquor resulting from the kraft and sulfite paper pulping process and the preparation of useful organic materials from the ligning. The useful organic materials include plastics, adhesives and resins for use, for example, in paints.<br>
The kraft pulping process broadly relates to the separation of wood into cellulose and lignin. Other materials are separated, for example sugars, hemicelluloses, tall oil, and other chemicals. The separation is effected essentially by cutting the wood into small portions and then cooking them under heat and pressure with certain pulping chemicals, which include sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. This cooking renders the lignin, sugars and hemicellulose materials soluble and these form the major materials present in the waste black liquor. There are, of course, other chemicals present as well as dissolved pulping chemicals. Normal procedure in a kraft plant is to evaporate the black liquor to a given solids content which solids are then burned in a furnace to recover the inorganic pulping chemicals which are recycled to produce more pulp. The<br><br>
cellulose  is insoluble in the black liquor and is separated therefrom and made into paper. The only value<br>
obtained from the lignin by this procedure is the heat value derived in the furnace.<br>
The invention disclosed in said prior art basically involves the separation or extraction of lignin from waste spent pulping liquor, also called the black liquor. The lignin may be used for many purposes and one use is to chemically place reactive unsaturated carbonyl groups or unsaturated nitrogen-containing compounds on the lignin molecule in addition to the unsaturated groups already naturally existing on the lignin molecule and thereafter produce an epoxide-lignin resin by reaction with another chemical, for example hydrogen peroxide. The epoxide-lignin resin may be cured to a hard infusible plastic by means of heat and/or a catalyst, it may be reacted with various fatty acids to produce resins for paints and inks or it may be reacted with various amines to produce polyamines or polyamides for use as adhesives or plastics. The aqueous phase of the waste black liquor from which the lignin is separated may be recycled in the normal way to recover the chemicals.<br>
The lignin separation portion of the invention taught by said US Patent is highly useful in and of itself since it provides an economical method for acquiring an excellent grade of lignin from both kraft and sulfite black liquor.<br>
The invention of the US patent teaches a process that enables lignin to be obtained from kraft black liquor in a fine powder or dissolved in an organic medium which then can be readily dissolved in various solvents and organic media.<br>
However, all the prior art processes suffer from the major disadvantage that they do not address the ecological impact of the lignin separation processes. None of the prior art processes known to the applicants selectively separate high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills. The prior art also suffers from the disadvantage that the lignin precipitated thereby are very difficult to filter. In fact, because of the fine colloidal nature of precipitated lignin the filtration of lignin becomes a difficult procedure. Because of this procedure lignin is made to flocculate in large particles during processing and the lignin formed is a cake-like material. Unfortunately this cake-like lignin material is very difficult to dissolve in solvents and other organic media. These cake-like lignins can be reprocessed to make them more usable, but<br><br>
the extra processing makes the cost of the lignin too expensive for large market application. In addition most<br>
prior art processes are directed to Kraft processes rendering them unsuitable for treatment of effluents released from small agro based paper and pulping mills. In addition, none of the prior art processes addresses the twin purpose of providing a commercially viable process for the extraction of high molar faction lignin from its most important source, i.e., black liquor from pulping mills and treatment of such black liquor to render it ecologically compatible .<br>
There is therefore, an urgent need for providing a commercially feasible and viable process for tapping an important source of lignin, a highly industrially useful product and at the same time, ensure that the black liquor released from small agro-based mills do not pose any environmental hazards. Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a process for the separation of lignin from the waste materials discharged from small agro-based pulp and paper mills.<br>
In another object of the present invention to provide a process for the selective separation and recovery of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills, especially small agro-based paper and pulp mills.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a process for the selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills, to render such black liquor more biodegradable and environmentally compatible.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an ecologically compatible process for the selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills which is inexpensive, easy to operate and overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art processes.<br>
It is a further important object of the present invention to provide a process for the selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills which permits easy filtration of the precipitated lignin.<br><br>
It yet another object of the present invention to provide a novel process for selective separation of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills, so that such mills may operate in a more eco-friendly manner and comply with the prescribed standards for emission.<br>
It yet another object of the present invention to provide a process for the selective separation and recovery of high molar mass lignin from black liquor discharged from paper mills for use in various industrial applications.<br>
Yet another object the present invention is to provide a process for selective separation and recovery of high molar mass lignin from black liquor with improved settleability of the precipitated high molar mass lignin.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a process for the precipitation and removal of only high molar mass fraction of lignin, which allows the resultant filtrate with improved anaerobic biodegradation efficiency and recovery of biogas rich in methane which can be utilised as a source of primary grade of energy in the form of fuel and/or for generation of electricity.<br>
These and the other objects of the present invention are achieved by the process of the present invention which employs a judicious combination of several factors such as choice of coagulants, flocculants, pH of the reaction medium and temperature of the reaction. The applicants have surprisingly found that a careful predetermined selection of such factors and parameters not only makes it possible to separate and recover high molar mass lignin from black liquor, but also renders the treated black liquor highly biodegradable thus, contributing to the safety of the ecosystem. Summary of the invention<br>
During pulping of agricultural based cellulosic materials for manufacturing of paper, delignification of fibrous raw materials takes place, wherein the lignin present in the raw material gets dissolved in the cooking liquor which is finally discharged as spent pulping liquor/black liquor. This dissolved lignin is present in the form of fragments of various sizes. In the spent pulping liquors, the high molar mass fraction amounts to nearly 75% of the total lignin, which is non-biodegradable or poorly biodegradable and bio-inhibitory.<br><br>
While various processes have been disclosed in the prior art for the separation of lignin, no prior art<br>
process known to the applicant recognizes the damage to the ecosystem caused by the presence of high molar mass fraction of lignin in the black liquor.<br>
In view of this, the applicants have developed a process for the selective separation of high molar mass fraction of lignin from the black liquor discharged from small agro-based pulp and paper mills in order to reduce the pollution load of the discharged effluent laden with lignin rich black liquor in terms of COD and colour. Removal of this high molar mass fraction of lignin further improves the treatability of the resultant liquor after removal of lignin, thereby helping the mills to achieve desired standards nearer to the specified norms for COD and colour.<br>
The process basically involves selective precipitation and flocculation of the high molar mass fraction of lignin by addition of an identified coagulant and a flocculant to an optimised pH level which is below neutral and temperature of the system is maintained between 50 - 70°C at a time less than 2 hours, which results in precipitation of 60 - 65 % of lignin in the form of high molar mass fraction. The precipitated lignin thus obtained has improved filterability, which is separated from the liquor.<br>
The resultant liquor thus obtained after separation of -60 - 65% of the high molar mass lignin is found to have reduced COD and colour to the tune of 48 - 52% and 0 - 75 % respectively. The liquor thus obtained is found to have improved anaerobic biodegradability, which was improved from 50 to 60 %, thus improving the overall treatment efficiency of the biological treatment system from 50% to nearly 75 - 80% COD reduction after lignin separation process. Detailed description of the invention<br>
Although many conventional mills have installed biological treatment systems for the treatment of lignin containing black liquor rich effluent, the treatment efficiency is not being achieved at the desired level as per the norms laid down by pollution control authorities and these mills are at the verge of closure because of not meeting the standards laid down by pollution control authorities.<br>
It has now been observed by the applicants that precipitation of this high molar mass fraction of lignin by a process of lowering of the pH of the black liquor to desired level and its separation from black<br><br>
liquor has been found effective in reducing the pollution load of the effluent in terms of COD and<br>
subsequently colour, which further results in lowering the COD/BOD ratio and making the filtrate prone to biodegradation by anaerobic and/or aerobic means.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided a process for selective separation of only high molar mass fraction of lignin by lowering the pH of the black liquor which is mainly responsible for non-biodegradable COD and also colour. The process basically comprises of selective precipitation of only that high molecular weight fraction of lignin, which restricts and inhibits the further biological treatment of the effluent by addition of identified mineral acids and in predetermined quantities at optimised pH. The precipitated lignin is strongly hydrophilic in nature. The applicants have recognized that the hydrophilicity of the precipitated lignin can be considerably reduced by addition of a flocculant and thus making it easily settleable bio-mass under optimised conditions of time and temperature and separated. The choice of the flocculant is extremely critical. It is highly preferred that the flocculant is ionic in nature. The preferred flocculants which may be employed are selected from the group consisting of polymeric organic compounds of cationic starches and/or polyacrylamide.<br>
In accordance with this invention, only higher molar mass fraction of lignin is precipitated by a careful choice of the cogulant, flocculant and the conditions for pH. The invention, inter alia, resides in the recognition of the fact that it is only higher molar mass fraction of lignin, which is responsible for nearly 50% of the COD value. It is higly preferred that the coagulant is a mineral acid. However, sulfur based mineral acids such as H2SO4 is undesirable since it could adversely affect the treatability of the resultant effluent..<br>
It has further been recognized by the applicants that such fraction of high molar mass lignin contributes to comparatively higher COD values i.e. 1.8g COD/g of lignin as compared to average molecular size of the lignin present in the black liquor, which contributes to only 1.4 g COD/g lignin.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the selective precipitation and recovery of high molar mass fraction of lignin from black liquor generated during chemical pulping of agro-based raw materials in pulp and paper mills which comprises treating such black liquor with a non sulfur based<br><br>
coagulant of the kind such as herein described in the presence of a hydrophobic flocculant such as herein<br>
described at apH in the range of 3.5 to 6 and a temperature in the range of 50 to 70°C for a period less than 2 hrs.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the flocculant is a polymeric substance. Preferably, the flocculant is selected from the group consisting of polymeric organic compounds of canonic starches and/or polyacrylamide, including those commercially available..<br>
The coagulant is preferably a mineral acid selected from HC1, HNO3, CH3COOH or mixtures of HC1 and CH3OOH, with HC1 being the most preferred mineral acid.<br>
pH plays a very critical role in the entire process, with the most preferred pH being from 4 to 4.2.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the high molar faction of the lignin separated from the black liquor has a COD value of 1.8 to 2.0 g lignin separated as against normal value of 1.1 to 1.2 g of black liquor.<br>
In another embodiment, the raw material employed in the mills is selected from bagasse, wheat straw, rice straw, and other grasses.<br>
The amount of lignin present in the black liquor is 30 to 35% of the total solids, of which high molar mass faction constitutes about 75%.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the treatment of black liquor generated during chemical pulping of agro-based raw materials in pulp and paper mills to render it more biodegradable which comprises treating such black liquor with a non sulfur based coagulant of the kind such as herein described in the presence of a hydrophobic flocculant such as herein described at a pH in the range of 4 to 6 and a temperature in the range of 50 to 70°C for a period less than 2 hrs.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to the following illustrative but non-limiting Examples. Example 1<br>
Preheated soda black liquor resulting from small agro-based pulp and paper mills employing wheat straw, bagasse, lake seeds (Sarkanda) and rice straw as major raw materials is acidified to a pH. Of 4.2 to 4.4<br><br>
static mixture while maintaining the temperature in the range of 50 to 60°C with the addition of a<br>
commercially available cationic organic polymeric flocculant in a reactor equipped with a flocculator at an rpm of 6 to 10. The retention time in the flocculator is 30 minutes. The acidified black liquor conditioned under the above conditions is allowed to drain in a clarifier with retention time of 6 hr. The clarified supernatant liquor from which high molecular weight lignin has been separated is sent for biological treatment, both aerobic and anaerobic after adjusting the pH to near neutral, i.e., 6.2 to 6.5 with the addition of lime. Example 2<br>
Using the process described in Example 1, experiments were conducted with soda black liquors of bagasse, wheat straw and sarkanda to optimise the pH at which precipitation of high molecular mass lignin takes place. From the results shown in Table 2, it can be seen that at a pH above 4.4 less than 50% of lignin is precipitated resulting in less than 40% of the COD reduction.<br>
On the other hand, at a pH below 4.2, although a higher removal of lignin and COD in the resultant liquor takes place, the ionic concentration of chlorides in the discharged effluent exceed the threshold limits specified by the government authorities. Also, the anaerobic biodegradability of the resultant effluent was found to be adversely affected. The results are shown in the following Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Experiments were carried out under the conditions described in Example 1 except that the temperature of the liquor was varied to arrive at an optimum temperature for flocculation and settling of the precipitated mass. Experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 25 °C to 70°C respectively at a pH between 4.2 to 4.4 and using other conditions described in Example 1. As can be seen from the results in Table 2, the settleability of the precipitated lignin was poor at temperature below 50°C as sludge volume index was higher than 20%, whereas above temperature of 70°C, lignin particles get disturbed and become colloidal. Therefore, it becomes difficult to settle the precipitated lignin, whereas under the conditions optimised for temperature in accordance with this invention, i,e., between 60°C to 70°C, the precipitated lignin sludge got compacted to a minimum sludge volume of 15 to 20%. The results are shown in Table 2, below:<br>
Table 2<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE 4:<br>
Using the conditions described in Example 1, studies were conducted to find out the anaerobic biodegradability of the resultant effluent after removal of high molar mass fraction of lignin from the black liquor and compared with original black liquor without lignin removal. It was observed that the overall anaerobic biodegradability improved form 45 - 50 % to nearly 80% after removal of lignin as evident from the results given in Table 3 below:<br><br>
3: Anaerobic biodegradability of black liquors before and after lignin separation<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Table 5 below shows the result of the original black liquor discharged in an agro-based mill employing bagasse, wheat straw, rice straw and other grasses and also of the resultant filtrate after removal of lignin from black liquor. Results clearly indicate that at an optimised pH using combination of mineral acid and an organic flocculant, 66% of the lignin was removed which could result in reduction of nearly 51% of COD.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
 Through this invention, anaerobic treatability of the resultant effluent after removal of lignin has also<br>
been improved which proves that the filtrate is anaerobically biodegradable an results in further reduction of COD. Table 1 also incorporates the results of anaerobic biodegradability of the filtrate after removal of lignin.<br>
The results clearly indicate that the filtrate obtained after lignin removal shows improved anaerobic biodegradability in terms of reduction of COD which was improved from 50% to 60% and the over all COD reduction was improved to 80% as against nearly 50% without removal of lignin. This is due to the separation of high molar mass fraction of lignin, which was acting as a recalcitrant material and inhibits the growth of anaerobic micro-organisms. The advantages derived by the present invention are, inter alia, as follows:<br>
1.	Lowering of the pH of the black liquor discharged from small agro-based mills at optimised level<br>
results in precipitation of only high molar mass fraction of lignin responsible for higher pollution load in<br>
terms of COD.<br>
2.	Optimised conditions for temperature and time after precipitation of lignin which further helps in<br>
reducing the hydrophilicity and therefore flocculation of precipitating lignin making its separation easy.<br>
3.	Removal of this precipitated and flocculated high molecular mass fraction of lignin which reduces the<br>
COD of the black liquor to the extent of nearly 51 % before subjecting it to any biological treatment system.<br>
4.	Increased biodegradation which further helps in improving the efficiency of the biological treatment<br>
system in small agro-based pulp and paper industries.<br>
5.	Achievement of overall anaerobic biodegradability of the black liquor in a biomethanation plant with<br>
integration of lignin separation process to an extent of 60% as against a normal treatment efficiency of 50%<br>
with black liquor without lignin removal process.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
