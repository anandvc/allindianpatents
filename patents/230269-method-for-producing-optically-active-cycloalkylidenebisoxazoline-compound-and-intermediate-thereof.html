The reaction of the optically active aminoalcohol (1) and the cycloalkylidenemalonic acid diester (2) is usually carried out in the presence of the lithium compound.<br>

The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of a solvent.

temperature which is a boiling point of the alcohol (5) and above.<br>

pressurized condition.  It can be also carried out under a reduced pressure in order to remove the alcohol (5) like the above.<br>

cycloalkylidenemalonic acid diester (2) to a mixture of the lithium compound and the optically active aminoalcohol (1) which is adjusted to the reaction temperature.<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3) can be obtained by adding water to the reaction mixture, if necessary conducting extracting treatment using a water-insoluble organic solvent such as toluene and ethyl acetate, and concentrating the organic layer obtained.  When the product is precipitated from the reaction mixture, the product can be isolated by the operation such as filtration. The optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3) obtained can be further purified by a conventional method such as distillation and recrystallization.<br>

by * in the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3) thus obtained is the same as that of the optically active aminoalcohol (1) used.<br>

Next, a step for obtaining the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline compound represented by the formula (4) (hereinafter, described as the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline (4)) by reacting the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3) with the sulfonylation agent in the presence of a basic compound.<br>
Examples of the basic compound include an organic amine compound such as pyridine, 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine and triethylamine; an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; and an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide and potassium tert-butoxide.  These basic compounds may be used alone and any two or more compounds may be used at the same time.  The amount of the basic compound to be used is not particularly limited and large excess thereof may be used as the solvent. The amount thereof is usually about 0*0005 to 5 moles relative to 1 mole of the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3).  When two or more compounds are used at the same time, this amount is sum of number of moles thereof.<br>
The sulfonylation agent represents at least one<br><br>
compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
alkylsulfonyl halides, arylsulfonyl halides, alkylsulfonyl<br>
anhydrides and arylsulfonyl anhydrides.<br>
Examples of alkylsulfonyl halides include compounds having 1 to 5 carbon atoms having an optionally substituted alkyl group such as methanesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl bromide, ethanesulfonyl chloride and ethanesulfonyl bromide.  Examples of arylsulfonyl halides include C6-10 compounds having an optionally substituted aryl group such as benzenesulfonyl chloride, benzensulfonyl bromide, paratoluenesulfonyl chloride and paratoluenesulfonyl bromide.  Examples of alkylsulfonyl anhydrides include C2-20 compounds having an optionally substituted alkyl group such as methanesulfonyl anhydride, ethanesulfonyl anhydride and trifluoromethanesulfonyl anhydride.  Examples of arylsulfonyl anhydrides include C12-20 compounds having an optionally substituted aryl group such as benzenesulfonyl anhydride and paratoluenesulfonyl anhydride.  Among these sulfonylation agents, methanesulfonyl chloride and paratoluenesulfonyl chloride are preferably used.<br>
The amount of the sulfonylation agent to be used is usually about 1 to 5 moles relative to 1 mole of the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out in the presence of<br><br>
a solvent.  The solvent is not particularly limited and examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as chlorobenzene, dichloromethane and dichloroethane; ether solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and tert-butyl methyl ether; and a mixture thereof.  The amount thereof is not particularly limited and it is usually 2 to 200 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3).<br>
The reaction temperature is usually a range of about -<br>
20 to 150°C, preferably a range of about 0 to 100°C.<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline (4) can be obtained by concentrating the reaction liquid obtained. The optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline (4) obtained can be purified by a conventional method such as column chromatography and recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
The configuration of the asymmetric center represented by * in the optically active cycloalkylidenebisoxazoline (4) thus obtained is the same as that of the optically active cycloalkylidenebisamidoalcohol (3) used.<br>

resulting mixture was heated to 60°C and stirred for 2 hours.  After a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added thereto and stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature, the separation was conducted to obtain the oil layer.  After the oil layer was washed with 20 mL of a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, a separation was conducted to obtain the oil layer.  The oil layer was dried over 5 g of<br><br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate.  This reaction liquid was filtered and the obtained filtrate was concentrated.  The residue was purified by column chromatography (alumina neutral, hexane:ethyl acetate = 10:1 (v/v)) to yield 1.85 g of a white powder of 1,1-bis[2-[(4S)-tert-butyloxazoline]]cyclopropane. Yield: 77%.<br>
