PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF IRIDIUM ACETATE<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of iridium acetate and to the<br>
iridium acetate obtainable according to that process. Additionally, the present invention<br>
relates to a process for the preparation of an iridium containing precipitate and applications<br>
of the precipitate and the iridium acetate (as a solid or in solution).<br>
The present invention also relates to iridium acetate having a low halide content, as a solid or<br>
as a solution, an iridium containing precipitate having a low halide content and a process for<br>
the preparation of these products.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the iridium acetate having a low halide content of the<br>
present invention and of the corresponding iridium acetate solution as a catalyst or a catalyst<br>
precursor in homogeneously or heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, selected from the group<br>
consisting of carbonylation reactions, hydroformylation reactions, coupling reactions,<br>
oxidation reactions, hydrogenation reactions, and hydrosilylation reactions, in electroplating,<br>
or for the preparation of catalysts for heterogeneous catalysis.<br>
A widespread application of iridium and compounds or complexes of iridium is their use as a<br>
catalyst for various chemical reactions, such as isomerization reactions, hydroformylation<br>
reactions or carbonylation reactions. Recently, particularly carbonylation reactions catalyzed<br>
by iridium or its compounds have gained in importance. One example is the iridium<br>
catalyzed carbonylation of methanol (with carbon monoxide) resulting in acetic acid or a<br>
reactive derivative thereof, referred to as Cativa process. Green iridium acetate was, inter<br>
alia, described as a suitable iridium compound for that process (EP-A-0 849 248).<br>
Processes for the preparation of iridium carboxylates were already described in the past. For<br>
example, a process is known from WO-A-96/23757, in which at least one chloride or<br>
bromide compound of iridium is reacted with an alkali or alkaline earth carboxylate in a<br>
medium containing a carboxylic acid to give an iridium carboxylate containing solution. To<br>
be able to use the solution for catalytic purposes, the alkali and alkaline earth chlorides and<br>
bromides obtained with this process as byproducts of the reaction are separated using ion<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
2<br>
exchange columns, wherein the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal ions are separated using a<br>
cationic ion exchange resin and the chloride or bromide ions are separated using an anionic<br>
ion exchange resin.<br>
The process yields indium acetate solutions with chloride contents below 0.0020% by<br>
weight, wherein these values are based on the iridium containing solution. The described<br>
solutions, however, have iridium contents of 1.65% by weight Ir (example 2) and 0.62% by<br>
weight Ir (example 3), resulting in a content of 1212 and 3225 ppm chloride, respectively,<br>
based on the proportion of iridium. These chloride contents are still too high for certain<br>
applications in catalysis.<br>
The process according to WO-A-96/23757 has the further disadvantage that the ion exchange<br>
materials required for the separation of chloride and bromide ions interfering with catalytic<br>
purposes are expensive. Furthermore, the process takes much time due to the time needed for<br>
the double ion exchange and the necessary regeneration of the column materials.<br>
Furthermore the ion exchange may lead to losses in yield.<br>
From EP-A-1 046 629 a process for the preparation of iridium acetate is known, wherein<br>
iridium hydroxide is precipitated from an aqueous solution of an iridium chloro compound<br>
using an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, the<br>
precipitated iridium hydroxide is separated and reacted with acetic acid or a mixture of acetic<br>
anhydride to give an iridium acetate containing solution and the iridium acetate is isolated<br>
from the solution as a solid. To obtain iridium acetate with a low chloride content, the<br>
iridium hydroxide is preferably reprecipitated prior to the reaction with acetic acid. To this,<br>
the iridium hydroxide is dissolved with nitric acid or with a mixture of nitric acid and<br>
hydrogen peroxide and iridium hydroxide is reprecipitated from the formed solution by<br>
addition of an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen<br>
carbonate. The iridium acetate isolated from the dark green solution is described as a dark<br>
green, glossy solid. The process, however, requires the isolation of the iridium acetate first<br>
obtained in aqueous solution as a solid, which is typically performed by evaporation<br>
optionally under vacuum. This isolation step is not only disadvantageous, because the<br>
evaporation of the aqueous solution takes a very long time (and therefore adversely affects<br>
the price of the product), but also bears the danger of decomposition or change of the<br>
product. Furthermore the reported yields leave room for improvement.<br>
Furthermore, in the course of the studies leading to the present invention it turned out, that<br>
the iridium acetate, described in EP-A-1 046 629 as "being low in chloride content" without<br>
giving any exact values, still contains amounts of chloride impurities even after performing<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
3<br>
the reprecipitation recommended in that description to reduce the chloride content. The<br>
obtained amounts of chloride impurities are too high and thus need improvement particularly<br>
with regard to the desired application for catalytic purposes<br>
Based on these findings it was an object of the present invention to provide an inexpensive<br>
process for the preparation of iridium acetate, whereby iridium acetate can be obtained in<br>
high yield and in high purity.<br>
Another object of the present invention was to provide iridium acetate having a low halide<br>
content and to provide an inexpensive process for the preparation thereof. Iridium acetate<br>
should be obtained in high yield and in high purity, particularly with a low halide content.<br>
These objects have been achieved by the surprising finding that iridium acetate can be<br>
obtained in high yield and in high purity, when the process as defined in the claims, is<br>
conducted in the presence of at least one compound, selected from oxalic acid, a salt of<br>
oxalic acid, formic acid and a salt of formic acid (subsequently oxalic acid, a salt of oxalic<br>
acid, formic acid and a salt of formic acid are briefly referred to as "component (i)").<br>
The present invention thus relates to a process for the preparation of iridium acetate<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	reacting an iridium compound with an alkaline compound in a protic solvent to obtain<br>
an iridium containing precipitate, wherein the reaction is conducted in the presence of<br>
at least one compound selected from oxalic acid, a salt of oxalic acid, formic acid and a<br>
salt of formic acid, and<br>
(b)	reacting the precipitate, optionally after separation, in the presence of<br>
(i)     at least one compound selected from oxalic acid, a salt of oxalic acid, formic acid<br>
and a salt of formic acid, and<br>
(ii)    CH3CO2H   and/or  CH3(CO)O(CO)CH3   (subsequently   briefly   referred   to   as<br>
component (ii))<br>
to give an iridium acetate containing solution, and<br>
(c)	optionally isolating the iridium acetate as a solid from the solution.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of an iridium containing<br>
precipitate, the process comprising step (a) as defined above, and to the iridium containing<br>
precipitate obtainable according to that process.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to an iridium acetate having a halide content of<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
4<br>
less than 1000 ppm, preferably less than 800 ppm (based on Ir), which is obtainable, for<br>
example, by the process of the present invention. Additionally, the present invention relates<br>
to an iridium containing precipitate having a halide content of less than 1000 ppm and<br>
preferably less than 800 ppm (based on Ir), and which is obtainable, for example, as an<br>
intermediate in the process of the present invention.<br>
Furthermore the present invention relates to the use of the iridium acetate of the present<br>
invention or of the iridium containing precipitate as a catalyst or a catalyst precursor in<br>
homogeneously or heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, selected from carbonylation<br>
reactions, hydroformylation reactions, coupling reactions, oxidation reactions, hydrogenation<br>
reactions, hydrosilylation reactions and isomerization reactions, and to the use in<br>
electroplating.<br>
In the present invention the term "at least one compound selected from (the listed<br>
possibilities)" means that one compound from the listed possibilities is required to be present<br>
and more than one compound from the listed possibilities, i.e. for example a mixture of two<br>
or three or more of the listed possibilities, may be present.<br>
The term "ammonium" in the present invention means a quaternary ammonium ion<br>
represented by the formula [NR1R2R3R4]+, wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are independently<br>
selected from a hydrogen atom and a lower alkyl group (preferably a C1 to C6, alkyl group),<br>
that may be linear, branched or cyclic. Preferably at least one of R1 to R4 represents a<br>
hydrogen atom and particularly preferably all of R1 to R4 represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
In the present invention the term "iridium acetate" means a compound having iridium<br>
atom(s) and acetate and is to be understood in this broad sense.<br>
The term "protic solvent" in the present invention means a solvent containing or able to<br>
release protons and/or able to form hydrogen bonds. Examples of protic solvents useful in<br>
the present invention are water and alcohols, e. g. C1-C6 alkanols (preferably methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol), and mixtures of two<br>
or more of these solvents. Preferred protic solvents for the purposes of the present invention<br>
are water and a mixture of water and a C1-C6 alkanol (preferably methanol). However, the<br>
present invention is not limited to these specific solvents. Suitable mixing ratios can readily<br>
be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In the present invention the term "inert gas" means a gaseous atmosphere, which is inert<br>
towards the starting compounds, the reaction mixture or the reaction products, respectively,<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
5<br>
i. e. will neither chemically nor physically alter them. Specifically the inert gas used is<br>
preferably essentially free of oxygen. Inert gases suitable for the purposes of the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to for example nitrogen, argon or other noble gases and<br>
mixtures thereof. Herein, the term "essentially free of oxygen" means, that the amount of<br>
oxygen that might be present in the inert gas atmosphere is in a range that does not adversely<br>
affect the course of the reaction, the yield and purity of the intermediates and end products.<br>
The amount of oxygen in the inert gas atmosphere that is still acceptable for the purposes of<br>
the present invention is about 2 percent by volume. Typically, the amount of oxygen in the<br>
inert gas atmosphere is less than about 1000 ppm, more preferably less than about 500 ppm<br>
(in terms of ideal volume fractions, i.e. parts by moles).<br>
This can be achieved, for example, by using industrial inert gases having a purity of about<br>
99.99% by volume. The amount of oxygen contained in the inert gas used may for example<br>
be, but is not limited to, less than about 100 ppm.<br>
In the following the process of the present invention will be described: The steps (a) and (b)<br>
will be described in detail.<br>
Step (a)<br>
Step (a) comprises reacting an iridium compound with an alkaline compound in a protic<br>
solvent to obtain an iridium containing precipitate. According to the present invention the<br>
reaction is conducted in the presence of at least one compound, selected from oxalic acid, a<br>
salt of oxalic acid, formic acid and a salt of formic acid (component (i)).<br>
The salts of oxalic acid and the salts of formic acid are not particularly limited. Basically,<br>
any salt of oxalic acid or formic acid may be used. Usually, the salt will be selected so that it<br>
is soluble in the protic solvent under the chosen reaction conditions.<br>

For performing of step (a) either one single compound, selected from component (i), or a<br>
mixture of several compounds, selected from component (i), may be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, step (a) is conducted in the presence of oxalic acid and/or<br>
ammonium oxalate.<br>
The iridium compound used as a starting material is not particularly limited. Thus the term<br>
"iridium compound", as used herein, is to be interpreted in a broad sense and includes both<br>
stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric compounds of iridium. The iridium compounds may<br>
also be complex-like compounds of iridium.<br>
In the practice of the invention it has proven useful to use an iridium compound as a starling<br>
material, that can be dissolved in the protic solvent used for the reaction.<br>
The oxidation state of the iridium in the iridium compound is not limited. Preferably the<br>
iridium is present in the oxidation state (0), (+1), (+III) or (+IV), preferably (+III) or (+IV),<br>
particularly preferably in the oxidation state (+IV). It is also possible for the iridium<br>
compound used as a starting material to contain iridium in a first oxidation state as well as<br>
iridium in a second (different from the first) oxidation state, for example iridium in the<br>
oxidation state (+III) as well as in the oxidation state (+IV). As examples of such iridium<br>
compounds mixed iridium(III)/iridium(lV) halides and their hydrates can be mentioned.<br>
From an economical viewpoint the use of readily available, e. g. commercially available, and<br>
inexpensive iridium compounds is preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the iridium compound is selected from iridium halogen (i. e.<br>
chlorine, bromine, or iodine, preferably chlorine) compounds, including but not limited to<br>

7<br>
magnesium and calcium) salts, hexachloroiridium(IV) acid and its ammonium, alkali<br>
(preferably sodium and potassium) and alkaline earth (preferably magnesium and calcium)<br>
salts, hexabromoiridium(IV) acid and its ammonium, alkali (preferably sodium and<br>

amine chloro complexes of the formula [IrCln(NH3)6-n](3 n)+ optionally having one or more<br>
counter ions for charge equalization (e. g. alkali, alkaline earth, or chloride ions), wherein n<br>
is an integer of 1 to 5, or compounds, such as [Ir(CO)2Cl]2, Ir4(CO)]2 or Ir(acac)3.<br>
With respect to the solubility in the protic solvent used and from an economical viewpoint<br>
the use of hexachloroiridium(III) acid and its sodium, potassium and ammonium salts,<br>
hexachloroiridium(IV) acid and its sodium, potassium and ammonium salts and of mixed<br>
iridium(IIl)/iridium(lV) halides and hydrates thereof is preferred. The use of Na2lrCl(,,<br>
K2IrCl6, (NH4)2IrCl6, H2IrCl6, Na3IrCl6, K3IrCl6, (NH4)3IrCl6-,, H3IrCl6 and<br>
iridium(+III)/iridium(+IV) chloride (hydrate) is particularly preferred.<br>
A mixture of two or more different iridium compounds may also be used.<br>
Examples of protic solvents useful in step (a) of the present invention are water and alcohols,<br>
e. g. C1-C6 alkanols (preferably methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, scc-<br>
butanol, tert-butanol), and mixtures of two or more of these solvents. Preferably water or a<br>
mixture of water and a C1-C6 alkanol (preferably methanol) is used as a protic solvent.<br>
The alkaline compound is selected from substances, the solutions of which exhibit an<br>
alkaline reaction in the presence of the protic solvent used. Examples of alkaline compounds<br>
suitable in the present invention are hydroxides of ammonium, alkali metals (i. e. Li, Na, K,<br>
Rb, Cs) or alkaline earth metals (i. e. Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr), carbonates and hydrogen carbonates of<br>
ammonium, alkali metals (i. e. Li, Na, K, Cs) or alkaline earth metals (i. e. Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr) or<br>
amines of the formula NR1R2R3, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from a<br>
hydrogen atom and C1-C6 alkyl groups (such as ammonia, triethyl amine and trimethyl<br>
amine). As the alkaline compound preferably an alkali metal hydroxide is used, more<br>
preferably sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and most preferably potassium<br>
hydroxide is used. A mixture of two or more alkaline compounds may also be used.<br>
The alkaline compound may be used as such or dissolved in one or more protic solvent(s), as<br>
defined above. Preferably the alkaline compound is at least partially dissolved in the protic<br>
solvent (mixture).<br>
To generate a precipitate it has proven advantageous to use the alkaline compound as<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
8<br>
solution in a protic solvent (preferably water) in a concentration of at least 1% by weight,<br>
preferably at least 5% by weight, more preferably in a concentration of 10 to 30% by weight,<br>
based on the protic solvent used.<br>
The alkaline compound is preferably used in an amount, based on iridium, significantly<br>
higher than the stoichiometric amount. The ratio of the alkaline compound (in moles, based<br>
on a monohydric alkaline compound) to iridium (moles) may for example be more than 2,<br>
preferably 3 to 20, particularly preferably 7 to 14. A suitable amount of the iridium<br>
compound is e. g. 0.5 to 15% by weight, preferably 1 to 8% by weight, particularly<br>
preferably 1.5 to 5% by weight, based on the starting solution used.<br>
The compound selected from component (i) is preferably used in at least an about equimolar<br>
amount (e. g. at least 0.8 mol equivalents, more preferably at least 1.0 mol equivalent, even<br>
more preferably 1.05 to 1.5 mol equivalents, based on iridium). When a mixture of<br>
compounds of the component (i) is used, the amounts shown refer to the total number of<br>
moles of the selected compounds.<br>
Step (a) is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas. Hence in a preferred<br>
embodiment both the reaction apparatus and the reactants used are rendered oxygen free by<br>
purging with an inert gas in a per se known manner.<br>
To obtain an iridium containing precipitate having good filtration properties step (a) is<br>
preferably conducted at a pH of about 6 to about 10, preferably of about 7 to about 9,<br>
particularly preferably at a pH of about 7.5.<br>
It has also proven advantageous to conduct step (a) with heating for example at 50 to 120 °C,<br>
particularly 60 to 110 °C, more preferably 70 to 95 °C. If step (a) is conducted with heating,<br>
it is preferable to cool or allow to cool the reaction mixture to room temperature prior to<br>
performing step (b).<br>
The addition of the iridium compound, of the alkaline compound, of said at least one<br>
compound selected from component (i) and of the protic solvent may be performed in any<br>
order. For example, first the protic solvent may be added and the iridium compound, the<br>
alkaline compound and the compound selected from component (i) may be added in any<br>
order or simultaneously.<br>
Although the addition of the iridium compound and of the alkaline compound may be<br>
performed in any order, it may be advantageous to first form a mixture (preferably solution)<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
9<br>
comprising the indium compound and at least one compound selected from component (i) in<br>
the protic solvent.<br>
Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment of the invention step (a) comprises the substeps (al)<br>
and (a2). In the present invention every reference to step (a) is to be understood as well as a<br>
reference to the preferred embodiment comprising the substeps (al) and (a2), unless stated<br>
otherwise.<br>
Substep(al)<br>
Substep (al) comprises forming a mixture (preferably solution) comprising the iridium<br>
compound and at least one compound selected from component (i), and the protic solvent<br>
optionally with heating.<br>
The addition in substep (al) may be performed in any order. For example first a mixture<br>
(preferably solution) comprising the iridium compound and a protic solvent, each defined as<br>
above, may be formed, to which at least one compound selected from component (i),<br>
optionally dissolved in a protic solvent, is added. The opposite order is acceptable as well.<br>
The addition may be performed independently from the order under the conditions<br>
subsequently defined for step (a).<br>
Substep (al) is preferably performed with heating for example at 50 to 120 °C, particularly<br>
60 to 110 °C, more preferably 70 to 95 °C. Particularly preferably, the elevated temperature<br>
in step (al) is maintained for a prolonged period of time, for example for a period of several<br>
minutes, particularly more than 10 minutes, preferably more than 30 minutes, even more<br>
preferably about 45 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
Substep (al) is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas.<br>
Substep (a2)<br>
Substep (a2) comprises reacting the mixture (preferably solution) obtained in step (al) with<br>
the alkaline compound (as defined above) to obtain an iridium containing precipitate,<br>
optionally with heating.<br>
The addition in substep (a2) may be performed in any order. For example, first the mixture<br>
(preferably solution) obtained in substep (al) may be added and the alkaline compound,<br>
optionally dissolved in a protic solvent, can be added thereto, or, conversely, first a mixture<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
10<br>
(preferably solution) comprising the alkaline compound and a protic solvent, each as defined<br>
above, may be formed, to which the mixture obtained in substep (al) is added.<br>
In a preferred embodiment substep (a2) is performed such that first the mixture (preferably<br>
solution) obtained in substep (al) is prepared and a solution comprising the alkaline<br>
compound and the protic solvent is added.<br>
Substep (a2) is preferably performed with heating for example at about 50 to about 120 °C,<br>
preferably about 60 to about 110 °C, more preferably about 80 to about 95 °C. Particularly<br>
preferably the elevated temperature in substep (a2) is maintained for a prolonged period of<br>
time, for example for a period of several hours, particularly more than 10 hours, preferably<br>
more than 15 hours, even more preferably more than 30 hours. The reaction time has no<br>
upper limit, but is typically less than 100 hours, preferably less than 90 hours, particularly<br>
preferably less than 80 hours. Most preferably, the reaction time is approximately 40 hours.<br>
Substep (a2) is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas.<br>
Independently from the order of the addition of the iridium compound, the alkaline<br>
compound and the compound selected from component (i), the addition in step (a) and<br>
substeps (al) and (a2) is typically performed with stirring. Independently from the order of<br>
the addition the addition may be performed for example by adding one single portion (i. e. as<br>
fast as possible) or by adding the substances to be added dropwise or in small amounts<br>
respectively over a period of a few seconds to several hours, e. g. within 10 seconds to 3<br>
hours, preferably within 1 minute to 60 minutes.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to a value of<br>
about 6 to about 9, preferably to about 7 to about 8.5, after completion of step (a) (i. c. after<br>
obtaining an iridium containing precipitate) and prior to performing step (b). The pH may be<br>
adjusted by adding either an additional amount of the alkaline compound, as defined above,<br>
or by adding a weakly acidic compound, such as diluted acetic acid or hydrochloric acid and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
To keep the halide content small for a later use as a catalyst, the pH is preferably not adjusted<br>
with an acid, that may additionally introduce halide ions into the reaction mixture.<br>
In the practice of the invention, acetic acid in a concentration of about 0.5 to 100% by<br>
weight, preferably 35 to 65% by weight, particularly preferably about 50% by weight (in<br>
water) has proven useful as a means to adjust the pH.<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
11<br>
Step (a) may comprise one or more optional substeps selected from separating, washing and<br>
reprecipitating the obtained iridium containing precipitate.<br>
Particularly when a halide containing iridium compound is used, carrying-out of separating<br>
and washing the iridium containing precipitate may advantageously affect the halide content<br>
of both the iridium containing precipitate and the iridium acetate obtainable therefrom.<br>
Particularly for a later application as a catalyst or catalyst component for homogeneously or<br>
heterogeneously catalyzed reactions the halide content should be as low as possible.<br>
Suitable conditions for the optional separation and the optional washing of the precipitate<br>
may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by routine tests. The following<br>
conditions are therefore not to be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
The optional separation of the obtained precipitate may be conducted by operations such as<br>
filtration, suction filtration, sedimentation or centrifugation. When separating the precipitate<br>
it may prove advantageous to avoid complete drying of the precipitate.<br>
The optional washing step of the precipitate may be conducted for example with a suitable<br>
washing liquid. As a washing liquid any liquid may be used, that is inert towards the<br>
precipitate of iridium hydroxide, i. e. that neither reacts with nor dissolves the same. Suitable<br>
washing liquids are for example water, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and mixtures thereof.<br>
To avoid the introduction of halide ions into the precipitate, however, halide free washing<br>
liquids, such as water and acetic acid and mixtures thereof (e. g. 5 to 20% by weight acetic-<br>
acid, particularly preferably 8 to 12% by weight acetic acid) are preferably used as washing<br>
liquids. In cases though, where the halide content is not critical, a halide containing washing<br>
liquid, such as hydrochloric acid diluted with water, may also be used. The washing liquid<br>
may optionally be slightly heated, e. g. at a temperature between 25 and 65 "C, preferably 40<br>
to 60°C (e. g. about 50°C).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention step (a) comprises the step of separating and<br>
washing the iridium containing precipitate. Particularly preferably, the precipitate is<br>
repeatedly washed, until halide ions (specifically chloride ions) can no longer be detected in<br>
the filtrate. The detection of halide ions in the filtrate can be performed in a manner known to<br>
the skilled person, for example using silver ions.<br>
The detection of chloride ions as silver chloride precipitate is very sensitive. With the naked<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
12<br>
eye chloride ions down to an amount of 50 ppm can be detected, i. e. the absence of turbidity<br>
when adding silver ions typically indicates a chloride content of less than about 50 ppm.<br>
Reprecipitation may optionally be conducted by dissolving the iridium containing precipitate<br>
in a suitable solvent and again precipitating with the alkaline compound (as described<br>
above). As solvents e. g. organic (e. g. acetic acid) or inorganic acids (e. g. hydrochloric acid,<br>
nitric acid) optionally in admixture with a protic solvent, as defined above, may be used.<br>
When desired, the reprecipitation may also be conducted in the presence of at least one<br>
compound selected from component (i). This is preferred. The reprecipitation step may<br>
optionally be conducted once or several times (e. g. twice, thrice). Preferably, the<br>
reprecipitation step(s) is (are) conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas (as described above).<br>
Typically, precipitates are obtained in step (a), that surprisingly even without conducting any<br>
reprecipitation step exhibit a high purity, as subsequently described in detail with regard to<br>
the obtained precipitate. Thus, a more preferred embodiment does not include a<br>
reprecipitation step of the iridium containing precipitate.<br>
The optional steps of separating, washing and reprecipitating the precipitate are preferably<br>
conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas.<br>
The iridium containing precipitate obtained in step (a) may be obtained in very good yields<br>
of typically about 92 to 95% or more, based on iridium (i. e moles Ir (educt)/moles Ir<br>
(product)).<br>
In one embodiment, step (a) comprises a step of allowing the iridium containing precipitate<br>
to age. The term "ageing" is known in the art and means a change in the physical and/or<br>
chemical properties of a substance during storage. The changes may occur naturally (e. g. by<br>
action of the ambient conditions on the substance) or may be generated artificially, e. g. by<br>
action of elevated temperature.<br>
In the present invention, however, it is not preferred to allow the iridium containing<br>
precipitate to age. Rather, a freshly precipitated iridium containing precipitate is preferably<br>
used for further reaction (e. g. the reaction in step (b)). The term "freshly precipitated" is to<br>
be understood in such a way, that the exposure to conditions causing a change in chemical<br>
and physical properties of the precipitate (i. e. allowing the precipitate to age) is preferably<br>
prevented. Such conditions may for example be one or more conditions selected from<br>
allowing to stand for a prolonged period of time (e. g. several hours, particularly more than 3<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
13<br>
hours), action of oxygen (for example in the form of air), removal of the protic solvent,<br>
removal of hydrate water and the like.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment one or more conditions selected from allowing to<br>
stand for more than 3 hours (particularly for more than 2 hours, more preferably for more<br>
than 1 hour, even more preferably for more than 30 minutes) at room temperature in an<br>
atmosphere of inert gas, action of oxygen (e. g. in the form of air, particularly for more than<br>
30 minutes) and complete drying are avoided. In this preferred embodiment the term freshly<br>
precipitated refers to the precipitate obtained under such condition(s).<br>
In this embodiment the precipitate obtained in step (a) is optionally reprecipitated, optionally<br>
separated and optionally washed, as described above, and immediately used for the desired<br>
application, e. g. for the reaction in step (b). The precipitate is preferably used for the desired<br>
application within a period of time of less than 3 hours, more preferably within a period of<br>
time of 2 hours, even more preferably within a period of time of 1 hour and most preferably<br>
within a period of time of 30 minutes, measured from the time of separation from the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Step (b)<br>
Step (b) comprises the reaction of the iridium containing precipitate obtained in step (a) to<br>
give an iridium acetate containing solution.<br>
According to the present invention step (b) is conducted in the presence of at least one<br>
compound selected from oxalic acid, a salt of oxalic acid, formic acid and a salt of formic<br>
acid (i. e. component (i)) and in the presence of at least one compound selected from (ii)<br>
acetic acid (CH3CO2H) and/or acetic acid anhydride (CH3(CO)O(CO)CH3) (i. e. component<br>
(ii)).<br>
The salts of oxalic acid and formic acid are not particularly limited. Basically, any salt of<br>
oxalic acid and any salt of formic acid may be used in step (b). Usually, the salt will be<br>
selected so that it is soluble in the reaction mixture under the chosen reaction conditions.<br>
Suitable examples of the salts of oxalic acid and suitable examples of the salts of formic acid<br>
include but are not limited to the compounds exemplified for step (a).<br>
The compound(s) selected from component (i) used in step (b) may be the same<br>
compound(s) as in step (a). Alternatively, different compounds or different mixtures of<br>
compounds selected from component (i) may be used in steps (a) and (b).<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
14<br>
Step (b) is preferably conducted in the presence of formic acid or a salt thereof.<br>
According to the present invention step (b) is conducted in the presence of at least one<br>
compound selected from CH3CO2H and/or CH3(CO)O(CO)CH3 (component (ii)). Preferably,<br>
step (b) is conducted in the presence of CH3CO2H or in the presence of a mixture of<br>
CH3CO2H and CH3(CO)O(CO)CH3, particularly preferably in the presence of CH3CO2H.<br>
Component (ii) may be provided for the reaction in step (b) in any form. For example,<br>
component (ii) may be present as such as well as in the form of a mixture with one or more<br>
protic solvents. In a preferred embodiment component (ii) is used as such, i. e. without<br>
addition of a protic solvent. Suitable protic solvents include the examples listed in step (a),<br>
with water being preferred as protic solvent. The mixing ratio of component (ii) and the<br>
protic solvent may be in the range of 99:1 to 1:99. As an example of one such mixture e. g. a<br>
mixture of glacial acetic acid and water in a ratio of 10:90 to 50:50, in terms of volume parts,<br>
may be illustrated. If component (ii) is provided as mixture with a protic solvent (mixture),<br>
the protic solvents used in steps (a) and (b) may be the same or different. Preferably in both<br>
steps the same protic solvent (mixture) is used. The use of component (ii) in the form of a<br>
mixture with a protic solvent selected from water and a C1-C6 alkanol, as defined in step (a),<br>
has proven useful.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment step (b) is conducted in the presence of 100% by<br>
weight to 95%by weight acetic acid (in water).<br>
In step (b) the at least one compound selected from component (i) is preferably used in at<br>
least an about equimolar amount (e. g. at least 0.8 mol equivalents, more preferably at least<br>
1.0 mol equivalent, even more preferably 1.05 to 1.5 mol equivalents, based on iridium).<br>
When a mixture of compounds of component (i) is used, the amounts shown refer to the total<br>
number of moles of the selected compounds.<br>
In step (b) the least one compound selected from component (ii) is used in a molar ratio of<br>
the compound selected from component (ii) to iridium, that is significantly higher than the<br>
stoichiometric ratio. Thus the at least one compound selected from component (ii) may serve<br>
both as a reactant and as a solvent for the resulting iridium acetate.<br>
In the course of the reaction in step (b) the reaction mixture is converted from a suspension<br>
of the iridium containing precipitate to a solution of iridium acetate.<br>
Accordingly, the reaction time for step (b) is chosen so that at the end of the reaction time an<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
15<br>
essentially clear solution containing no substantial (preferably no visible) amounts of solids<br>
is formed. Preferred reaction times for step (b) are about 8 to about 50 hours, preferably<br>
about 10 to about 25 hours, more preferably about 12 to about 17 hours.<br>
In a preferred embodiment step (b) is conducted with heating e. g. at a temperature ranging<br>
from about 80 to 120 °C, particularly preferably from about 90 to 105 °C.<br>
It is particularly preferred to perform step (b) with heating to reflux. The exact temperature<br>
will mainly depend upon the compound selected from component (ii), that will be used.<br>
Typically a suitable temperature will be more than about 100 °C, e. g. about 101 to about 112<br>
°C for 60% by weight acetic acid in water, about 118 °C for 100% by weight acetic acid<br>
(glacial acetic acid) and about 139 °C for 100% by weight acetic anhydride.<br>
Step (b) is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas.<br>
Optionally, the solution obtained in step (b) comprising indium acetate may be filtered to<br>
remove any insoluble residues possibly contained in the solution. However, usually no<br>
visible residue is seen on the filter, which is indicative for the completeness of the reaction in<br>
step (b). The optional filtering step may be performed by means known to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, e. g. by filtering through various filters (e. g. Blauband, or membrane) or/and<br>
polishing, filtration through various filters (e. g. nylon filters having a pore size of preferably<br>
more than 5 μm to 20 μm).<br>
The filtration may also be performed under pressure, for example under pressures between 1<br>
and 5 bar, preferably at about 2 bar. The filtration may be performed at any temperature, e. g.<br>
at a temperature ranging from 20 to 30 °C. The filtration may be performed in the absence or<br>
presence of filtering aids, such as glass frost, activated carbon, cellulose (e. g. Hyflow). The<br>
filtration is preferably conducted in an atmosphere of inert gas.<br>
If step (b) is conducted with heating, it is preferable to cool or allow to cool the solution to<br>
room temperature prior to performing optional steps, such as filtration or step (c).<br>
Step (c)<br>
If desired the indium acetate may be isolated from the solution as a solid. The separation<br>
may be performed in a per se known manner, e. g. by concentrating the reaction mixture or<br>
distilling off the volatile components contained in the reaction mixture optionally under<br>
vacuum and/or at elevated temperatures. However, the present invention is not limited to<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
16<br>
these illustrated methods of isolation. Step (c) may be conducted in an atmosphere of inert<br>
gas, however, this is neither required nor preferred.<br>
In the process of the present invention iridium acetate can be produced in very good yields<br>
(about 95% or more, based on Iridium (in moles) and with respect of the entire process).<br>
Additionally the iridium acetate of the present invention is characterized by its high purity, as<br>
described in the following in more detail.<br>
Iridium acetate<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention relates to iridium acetate obtainable according to<br>
the process as described in any of claims 18 to 22.<br>
After conducting the steps (a) and (b) of the present invention a solution containing iridium<br>
acetate is obtained. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a such a solution<br>
containing iridium acetate.<br>
As described above, iridium acetate may also be isolated from the solution as a solid, if<br>
desired. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to iridium acetate as a solid.<br>
Hence, according to the present invention, the iridium acetate of the present invention may<br>
be present as a solid or dissolved in a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include, but are not<br>
limited to protic solvents. Suitable protic solvents are, for example, water and alcohols, e. g.<br>
C1-C6 alkanols (preferably methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, sec-<br>
butanol, tert-butanol), and mixtures of two or more of these solvents. If the iridium acetate is<br>
present as a solution this solution is not limited with regard to its composition.<br>
A preferred solution comprises (preferably consists of), in addition to the iridium acetate of<br>
the present invention, at least one compound selected from component (i), and at least one<br>
compound selected from component (ii), and, optionally, a protic solvent (mixture). This<br>
preferred solution is not limited with regard to its composition.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the iridium acetate solution comprises (preferably consists<br>
of) the following components:<br>
-    2 to 20% by weight of iridium acetate,<br>
20 to 90% by weight of component (ii) (preferably acetic acid),<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
17<br>
1 to 20% by weight of component (i) (preferably formic acid), and<br>
5 to 70% by weight of a protic solvent (mixture) (preferably water).<br>
The iridium acetate of the present invention (as a solid and as a solution) is characterized by<br>
its low content of impurities. Such impurities may for example be ionic constituents<br>
contained in the starting compounds used, such as ammonium, alkali or alkaline earth ions or<br>
halide ions.<br>
The iridium acetate of the present invention is in the form of a solution as well as in form of<br>
the isolated solid stable towards air and may be stored for a prolonged period of time (e. g.<br>
for a period of several months to 2 years) without any change in the physical and chemical<br>
properties.<br>
Moreover, the iridium acetate present as a solid is characterized by its very good solubility in<br>
solvents, such as water, acetic acid (CH3COOH) and methanol, and mixtures of one or more<br>
of these solvents.<br>
Typically, the iridium acetate of the present invention (as solid and as a solution) is blue-<br>
green in color, whereas prior art consistently reports "green iridium acetate". In all examples<br>
of EP-A-01 046 629 a dark green solution or suspension of iridium acetate is obtained, from<br>
which a dark green solid is obtained by evaporation. The solution of iridium acetate obtained<br>
in example 1 of WO-A-96/23757 is also described as being "green".<br>
Figure 1 shows a visible/ultraviolet spectrum of the compound obtained in comparative<br>
example 1 (according to EP-A-01 046 629).<br>
Figure 2 shows a visible/ultraviolet spectrum of iridium acetate according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
A comparison of the spectra shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 shows that the absorption<br>
maximum (λmax) of the iridium acetate of the present invention is shifted towards shorter<br>
wavelengths, as compared to the iridium acetate obtained according to the process of EP-A-<br>
01 046 629. This indicates a specific chemical structure of the iridium acetate of the present<br>
invention. Generally, the absorption maximum (λ.max) of the iridium acetate of the present<br>
invention is shifted to wavelengths shorter than 680 nm, preferably shorter than 675 nm and<br>
more preferably shorter than 670 nm in the visible/ultraviolet spectrum.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to an iridium acetate (as a solid or as a<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
18<br>
solution, as described above) characterized in having a low halide (preferably chloride)<br>
content. In particular, the iridium acetate of the present invention is characterized by having a<br>
very low halide (preferably chloride) content of less than 1000 ppm, and more preferably less<br>
than 800 ppm (all ppm values in terms of parts by weight, based on Ir)<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, as described above, halide contents<br>
below 200 ppm, particularly below 100 ppm or even lower, e. g. below 50 ppm, are obtained<br>
(all ppm values in terms of ppm by weight, based on Ir).<br>
The content of other impurities (particularly ammonium, alkali or alkaline earth ions) is in<br>
the same order of magnitude as the results obtained for the halide impurities.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the contents of other impurities, particularly ammonium, alkali<br>
(i. e. Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, preferably K) or alkaline earth (i. e. Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr, preferably Mg<br>
and Ca) ions each are typically below 1000 ppm, preferably below 500 ppm and particularly<br>
preferably below 300 ppm (based on Ir).<br>
The halide content (which in this application is understood as being the total halide content,<br>
comprising the ionically as well as the covalently bound halide of the sample) may be<br>
determined using methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In the present invention a<br>
preferably used method of the determination (in the intermediate and in the end product) is<br>
the so called "analysis of total halide content according to W1CKBOLD", as described in the<br>
examples.<br>
The determination of the content of other possible ionic constituents (in the intermediate and<br>
in the end product) (such as ammonium, alkali or alkaline earth ions) is also known to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art and, for example, ICP analysis (ICP = Inductive Coupled Plasma)<br>
may be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the iridium acetate with a low halide content of the present<br>
invention can be obtained by the processes defined in any of claims 18 to 22.<br>
Iridium Containing Precipitate<br>
In another aspect, the present invention also relates to an iridium containing precipitate.<br>
The term "iridium containing precipitate", as used herein, refers to the iridium containing<br>
precipitate obtainable in step (a) from the iridium compound by adding the alkaline<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
19<br>
compound (i. c. in the presence of OH~-ions) and is to be understood in this broad sense.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by any specific theory it is believed that the precipitate is an<br>
indium oxygen compound having besides the iridium atoms as compound constituents one or<br>
more compound constituents, selected from hydroxo, oxo and aquo groups and hydrate<br>
constituents, wherein the iridium atoms may be present in only one oxidation state (e. g. all<br>
in (+III) corresponding to Ir(III) oxide hydrate, or all in (+IV) corresponding to Ir(lV) oxide<br>
hydrate) or the iridium atoms may be present in oxidation states differing from one another.<br>
e. g. a portion in the oxidation state (+III) and the remainder in the oxidation state (+IV).<br>
Anyone skilled in the art of transition metal oxygen compounds knows that typically such<br>
compounds are non stoichiometric compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the term "iridium containing precipitate" refers to the freshly<br>
precipitated precipitate, as described above.<br>
The iridium containing precipitate obtainable by conducting step (a) is characterized by a<br>
good filterability.<br>
Additionally, it was surprisingly found that by conducting step (a) in the presence of at least<br>
one compound selected from component (i) a precipitate may be obtained, that is<br>
characterized by a very good solubility for example in inorganic acids, such as mineral acid<br>
(e. g. hydrochloric acid or nitric acid), and organic acids, such as acetic acid (or acetic<br>
anhydride).<br>
Typically, the precipitate can be completely (typically more than 95% by weight) dissolved<br>
in the aforesaid acids or a mixture thereof. The role that the presence of component (i) plays<br>
is still unclear, however, it seems to cause the good solubility. The very good solubility of<br>
the iridium containing precipitate according to the present invention also means an<br>
improvement of the yield and hence of the productivity of the process for the preparation of<br>
iridium acetate. By minimizing the insoluble impurities the purity and stability of the indium<br>
acetate obtained in step (b) is improved significantly.<br>
In one embodiment the iridium containing precipitate is obtainable by the process according<br>
to any of claims 9 to 17.<br>
According to the present invention, the iridium containing precipitate of the present<br>
invention is characterized in particular by its low content of impurities.<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
20<br>
Such impurities may for example be ionic constituents contained in the starting compounds<br>
used, such as ammonium, alkali or alkaline earth ions or halide ions. For a later use as a<br>
catalyst or catalyst precursor, particularly the presence of halide ions (e. g. chloride, bromide<br>
or iodide ions, particularly chloride ions) is undesirable.<br>
Hence, in a preferred embodiment the invention relates to an iridium containing precipitate<br>
having a low halide (preferably chloride) content.<br>
The iridium containing precipitate of the present invention is characterized by a very low<br>
halide content (particularly chloride content). Typically the halide content is below 1000<br>
ppm and more preferably below 800 ppm (based on Ir).<br>
In particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, as described above, halide contents<br>
below 200 ppm, particularly below 100 ppm or even lower, e. g. below 50 ppm, are typically<br>
obtained. The given ppm values are based on iridium (in terms of parts by weight).<br>
The precipitate is characterized by a very high purity in other respects as well. The content of<br>
other impurities is in the same order of magnitude as the results obtained for the halide<br>
impurities. Such other impurities may for example be ionic constituents contained in the<br>
starting compounds used, such as ammonium, alkali or alkaline earth ions.<br>
The content of other impurities, particularly ammonium, alkali (i. e. Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs,<br>
preferably K) or alkaline earth (i. e. Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr, preferably Mg and Ca) ions is typically<br>
below 1000 ppm, preferably below 500 ppm and particularly preferably below 300 ppm<br>
(based on Ir).<br>
The iridium containing precipitate having a low total halide content of the present invention<br>
can, for example, be obtained as an intermediate by the process as described in any of claims<br>
9 to 17 .<br>
Surprisingly, these high degrees of purity in the products and intermediates of the present<br>
invention are obtained even when, as preferred in the present invention, troublesome means<br>
to reduce undesired impurities (particularly halide), as taught in the prior art (such as<br>
reprecipitation of the iridium containing precipitate e. g. by dissolving in nitric acid or a<br>
mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide and again precipitating by adding an alkali<br>
metal hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen carbonate according to EP-A-1046629), are omitted.<br>
The fact that the products and intermediates of the process of the present invention (i.e.,<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
21<br>
iridium acetate and iridium containing precipitate) obtainable in absence of a reprccipitation<br>
step, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, has even lower halide content<br>
than the iridium product obtainable according to the prior art process including such<br>
reprecipitation step (here a halide content of about 6% is obtained, in terms of % by weight<br>
based on Ir) is particularly surprising.<br>

Examples<br>
The following examples serve to further explain the invention and are not to be construed as<br>
limiting. In the present invention "water" is understood as being water in its deionised form<br>
("DI water").<br>
Measuring Methods/Analytics<br>
Visible/Ultraviolet Spectra:<br>
Measurement of the visible/ultraviolet spectra was conducted at room temperature using a<br>
UV spectrometer "Jena Specord 200" (tungsten lamp (VIS), deuterium lamp (UV)) and 1 cm<br>
cuvets (quartz glass cuvets "Soprasil", manufactured by Helma) in a measuring range of 200<br>
nm to 1100 nm. Solid iridium acetate was dissolved in DI water in the concentrations<br>
indicated in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Determination of the Halide Content:<br>
The determination of the halide (preferably chloride) content was conducted according to a<br>
method comprising the steps: (1) taking up the sample in a suitable solvent, (2) combustion<br>
in a oxyhydrogen flame, (3) collecting the condensate in a solution of sodium hydroxide and<br>
(4) determination of the halide content by ion chromatography (IC). This method is known<br>
by the designation "analysis of total halide content according to WICKBOLD".<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>
26<br>
Determination of the Content of Alkali Ions and Iridium:<br>
The determination of the iridium content and of the content of any optionally contained alkali<br>
ions was conducted by ICP analysis in a manner known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of an Iridium Containing Precipitate (Step (a))<br>
Apparatus:      1-L standard stirring apparatus (condenser, mechanical stirrer, inert)<br>
With stirring 50 g of iridium as ca. 4% by weight solution of H2IrCl6 were heated to about 95<br>
°C with 4.0 g of oxalic acid and maintained at that temperature for about 2 hours. After<br>
addition of KOH (10% by weight in water, about 10 eq. based on Ir) within 20 minutes the<br>
reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The pH was readjusted with<br>
acetic acid (50% by weight in water) to a value of approximately 7.5. Filtration through<br>
Blauband at room temperature and subsequent washing of the suspension with acetic acid<br>
(10% by weight in water) and DI water until the washing water was free of chlorine gave the<br>
product as a compact black solid.<br>
An analysis of the filtrate by ion chromatography gave an iridium content of 
yield based on iridium contained in the filter cake was &gt; 99 %.<br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Iridium Acetate (Step (b))<br>
Apparatus:      500-rnL standard stirring apparatus (condenser, mechanical stirrer, inert)<br>
The filter cake obtained in step (a) together with 200 g of glacial acetic acid was placed in<br>
the apparatus and 2 g of formic acid were added. With stirring the reaction mixture was<br>
heated to reflux. At this temperature the reaction mixture was allowed to dissolve for 10<br>
hours. After cooling to room temperature and filtration through Blauband the product was<br>
obtained as dark blue green solution. Removal of the solvent under vacuum yielded solid Ir-<br>
acetate as dark green crystals (yield: ca. 78-80%, based on iridium).<br><br>
WO 2006/125628	PCT/EP2006/004964<br>

An analysis of the solution obtained in step (b) gave the following results: Cl 
50 ppm, Ir ca. 2.5-3% by weight.<br>
The visible/ultraviolet spectrum of the product shows an absorption maximum at λmax =<br>
668.4 nm (cf. Figure 2). The concentration of iridium acetate in DI water is 51,9 mg/50 ml<br>
(= 1,038 mg/ml).<br>

Example 1 was repeated with the sole difference that in step (a) 50 g of iridium as ca. 4% by<br>
weight solution of H2lrCl6 were heated to about 95°C with 4.0 g of oxalic acid and<br>
maintained at that temperature for about 90 minutes.<br>
Step (b) was performed as described with respect to Example 2, whereby solid indium<br>
acetate is obtained as dark green crystals (yield: 78 - 80%, based on iridium). The iridium<br>
acetate obtained is dissolved in DI water. The concentration of the solution obtained was<br>
3,53 % by weight of Ir.<br>

Example 4<br>
Preparation of an Iridium Containing Precipitate (Step (a))<br>
Apparatus:      1-L standard stirring apparatus (condenser, mechanical stirrer, inert)<br>
With stirring 50 g of iridium as ca. 4% by weight solution of H2lrCl6 were heated to about<br>
98°C with 4.0 g of oxalic acid and maintained at that temperature for about 90 minutes. After<br>
addition of KOH (10% by weight in water, about 10 eq. based on Ir) within 20 minutes the<br>
reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The pH was readjusted with<br>
acetic acid (50% by weight in water) to a value of approximately 7.5. Filtration through<br>
Blauband at room temperature and subsequent washing of the suspension with acetic acid<br>
(10% by weight in water) and DI water until the washing water was free of chlorine gave the<br>
product as a compact black solid.<br>
An analysis of the filtrate by ion chromatography gave an iridium content of 
yield based on iridium contained in the filter cake was &gt; 99 %.<br>
Preparation of Iridium Acetate (Step (b))<br>
Apparatus:      500-mL standard stirring apparatus (condenser, mechanical stirrer, inert)<br>
The filter cake obtained in step (a) together with 200 g of glacial acetic acid was placed in<br>
the apparatus and 2 g of formic acid were added. With stirring the reaction mixture was<br>
heated to reflux. At this temperature the reaction mixture was allowed to dissolve for 12<br>
hours. After cooling to room temperature and filtration through Blauband the product was<br>
obtained as dark blue green solution. Removal of the solvent under vacuum yielded solid Ir-<br>
acetate as dark green crystals (yield: ca. 78%, based on iridium). The iridium acetate<br>
obtained is dissolved in DI water. The concentration of the solution was 4,06% by weight of<br>
Ir.<br>
Analytical Results<br>

The visible/ultraviolet spectrum of the product shows an absorption maximum at λmax =<br>
668.2 nm. The concentration of iridium acetate in DI water is 0,744 mg/ml.<br>
Comparative example<br>
(According to EP 1 046 629, Example 2)<br>
Apparatus:      100-mL standard stirring apparatus (condenser, stirrer), inert gas atmosphere<br>
8.7 g of a ca. 23% by weight solution of H2IrCl6 were concentrated under vacuum at 55°C,<br>
until a viscous oil was formed. A black solid resulted after cooling to room temperature. This<br>
was taken up in 60 ml water and heated to 80°C. A dark solution formed, which was<br>
dropwise adjusted to pH 7.3 with In KOH solution. Here a black precipitate formed which<br>
was filtered still hot through Blauband. The filter cake was then washed with water using 100<br>
ml portions until chlorine free. The filter cake was sucked dry. The resulting solid was<br>
suspended with 60 ml glacial acetic acid and heated to reflux for 23 hours. 2 hours prior to<br>
the end of the refluxing time further 15 ml of glacial acetic acid were added. After cooling to<br>
room temperature the resulting dark green solution was fine filtered through a G4 glass frit.<br>
After concentration of the solution under vacuum 2.5 g of a green solid (yield: 65%, based on<br>
iridium) formed.<br>
An analysis of the product by ion chromatography gave an iridium content of 56.6% by<br>
weight (based on the solid).<br>
Analytical Results<br>
Total chlorine content according to WICKBOLD:<br>
Cl content (based on the solid):	Cl = 6% by weight (60000 ppm)<br>
Cl content (based on Ir)	Cl = 10.6% by weight (106000 ppm)<br>
These values are markedly higher than the Cl contents of the iridium acetate of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The visible/ultraviolet spectrum of the product shows an absorption maximum at λmax = 682<br>
nm (cf. Figure 1). The concentration of iridium acetate in DI water is 0,61 mg/ml.<br><br>
