				<td>MULTI-LAYER COMPOSITES FORMED FROM COMPOSITIONS HAVING IMPROVED ADHESION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to multi-layer composites of two or<br>
more polymeric layers, at least one of which is formed from a thermosetting composition. The composite comprising at least a first polymeric layer formed on a substrate and a second polymeric formed over at least a portion of the first polymeric layer. The present invention also relates to thermosetting coating compositions used to form the multi-layer composites and which improve the interlayer adhesion of the multi-layer composites.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Color-plus-clear coating systems involving the application of a<br>
colored or pigmented basecoat to a substrate followed by application of a transparent or clearcoat over the basecoat have become increasingly popular as original finishes for a number of consumer products including, for example, automotive vehicles. The cotor-plus-clear coating systems have outstanding appearance properties such as gloss and distinctness of image, due in large part to the clearcoat. Such color-plus-clear coating systems have become popular for use with automotive vehicles, aerospace applications, floor coverings such as ceramic tiles and wood flooring, packaging coatings and the like.<br>
[0003]	A typical automotive coating system can include the sequential<br>
application of an electrodeposition primer, a primer-surfacer, a color providing base coat, and a transparent topcoat. Also, adhesive coatings or layers, for example, windshield adhesives, trim and molding adhesives and structural adhesives are sometimes applied to the cured topcoats. In fabricating these multi-layer composite coatings, it is necessary that the various layers have acceptable interlayer adhesion.<br>
 [0004]	On commercial automobile coating lines during application of<br>
the coating system, certain portions of the line can experience occasional process problems, for example, where the color coat applicator malfunctions, or curing oven faults where temperatures are out of specification. In these instances where the clear coat application system is malfunctioning, some automobile manufacturers may elect to fully cure the applied color coat and then reapply the color coat over the fully cured color coat prior to application of the clearcoat. In such situations, the fully cured color coat can have poor intercoat adhesion with the subsequently applied color coat, even though the compositions may be the same.<br>
[0005]	Further, during the assembly process, the applied color-plus-<br>
clear coating can include surface defects in the clear coat surface that requires repair. Some automobile manufacturers may elect to remove the defect and recoat the repair area with the same clear coat composition. In this instance, the cured clear coat must have excellent intercoat adhesion to the subsequently applied clear coat. It is known, however, that some clear coats when cured have poor intercoat adhesion with the subsequently applied repair clear coat.<br>
[0006]	Also, windshields and other items such as trim moldings<br>
typically are affixed to the body of a vehicle with an adhesive material, typically a moisture-cured material containing isocyanate group-containing polymers. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (MVSS) require that these adhesives have complete adhesion to both the windshield and the coated substrate to which they are applied. These adhesive products adhere well to many cured topcoating compositions used to coat vehicles such as automobiles. It is known, however, that these adhesive materials often do not completely adhere to some topcoats, for example, those formed from coating compositions based on carbamate and/or urea containing polymers. This necessitates the application of a primer coating to the cured carbamate and/or urea-based top coatings prior to application of the windshield adhesive to ensure compliance with the aforementioned Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.<br>
Use of such primer coatings has proven to be effective, but primer coating application adds an additional and expensive step to the windshield and/or trim installation processes.<br>
[0007]	In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the coating industry<br>
for coating compositions that have improved intercoat or interlayer adhesion properties.<br>
[0008]	It has now been found that certain adhesion-promoting agents<br>
that have surface active properties such that the solubility parameter of the coating composition containing the adhesion-promoting agent is sufficiently different from that of an analogous coating composition which does not contain the adhesion-promoting agent; the adhesion-promoting agent partitions to the surface region of the resultant coating. This can result in a concentration of the adhesion-promoting agent at the surface region which is greater than the concentration in the interior or bulk region of the coating layer. This partitioning effect of the adhesion-promoting agent can significantly increase its effect in promoting the adhesion of the coating layer that contains the adhesion-promoting agent to a subsequently applied coating layer, as well as to the substrate to which it is applied.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009]	The present invention is directed to a multi-layer composite of<br>
two or more polymeric layers at least one of which is formed from a thermosetting composition. The composite comprises at least a first polymeric layer formed on a substrate and a second polymeric layer over at least a portion of the first polymeric layer, wherein in the absence of a boron-containing compound, the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer have poor interlayer adhesion. The improvement comprises the inclusion of an adhesion-promoting agent in one or both of the first and second polymeric layers in an amount sufficient to improve the interlayer adhesion of the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer. The adhesion-promoting agent is derived from:<br>
 (i)       boric acid or an equivalent thereof,<br>
(ii)       an ester having two or more terminal hydroxyl groups that are<br>
derived at least in part from a 1,3-polyol, the equivalent ratio of boric acid or<br>
equivalent thereof to hydroxyl being greater than 0.1:1 and the equivalent<br>
ratio of 1,3-polyol to acid being greater than 2:1.<br>
[0010]	The present invention is also directed to a thermosetting<br>
composition comprising (A) a film-forming polymer having reactive functional groups; (B) a curing agent having functional groups that are reactive with the functional groups of the polymer (A); and (C) an adhesion-promoting agent as described above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011]	Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise<br>
indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions<br>
and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as<br>
being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless<br>
indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following<br>
specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary<br>
depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present<br>
invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of<br>
the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical<br>
parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported<br>
significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0012]	Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters<br>
setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.<br>
[0013]	Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited<br>
herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example,<br>
a range of "1 to 10" is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10, that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10.<br>
[0014]	As used herein, in the specification and in the claims, by "boric<br>
acid equivalents" is meant any of the numerous boron-containing compounds that can hydrolyze in aqueous media to form boric acid. Specific, but non-limiting examples of boric acid equivalents include boron oxides, for example, B203; boric acid esters such as those obtained by the reaction of boric acid with an alcohol or phenol, for example, trimethyl borate, triethyl borate and triphenyl borate.<br>
[0015]	Additional non-limiting examples of boric acid equivalents may<br>
include, other amino-containing borates and tertiary amine salts of boric acid.<br>
Such boron-containing compounds include, but are not limited to, 2-(beta-<br>
dimethylaminoisopropoxy)-4,5-dimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane and 2-(beta-<br>
diethylaminoethoxy)-4,4,6-trimethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborinane.<br>
[0016]	Boric acid equivalents can also include metal salts of boric acid<br>
(i.e., metal borates) provided that such metal borates can readily dissociate in aqueous media to form boric acid. Suitable examples of metal borates include, for example, calcium borate, potassium borates such as potassium metaborate and potassium tetraborate.<br>
[0017]	The ester for use in the present invention is a material<br>
containing at least one ester linkage and can be a monoester or a polyester<br>
having two or more terminal hydroxyl groups that are derived from reacting a<br>
mono or polyacid with a polyol, at least a portion of which is a 1,3-polyol.<br>
Among the monocarboxylic acids that can be used are those containing at<br>
least six contiguous carbon atoms, or from 7 to 18 contiguous carbon atoms.<br>
[0018]	Non-limiting examples of suitable monocarboxylic acids include<br>
heptanoic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, n-undecylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, oleic acid,<br>
elaidic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dihydroxystearic acid, ricinoleic acid and isomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0019]	In a non-limiting embodiment, the ester-containing material is a<br>
polyester. Polyesters can be prepared in a known manner by condensation of polyhydric alcohols and polycarboxylic acids. Suitable polycarboxylic acids include those containing from 4 to 40 contiguous carbon atoms and from 2 to 3 carboxylic acid groups. Non-limiting examples include succinic acid, adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, phthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, hexahydrophthalic acid and trimellitic acid, and fatty carboxylic acids such as those available as EMPOL 1008, EMPOL 1010 and PRIPOL 1013. In addition to the polycarboxylic acids mentioned above, functional equivalents of the acids such as anhydrides where they exist or lower alkyl esters of the acids such as methyl esters can be used.<br>
[0020]	The polyols that may be employed in the present invention may<br>
include alkylene polyols containing from 2-16 carbon atoms, such as but not<br>
limited to ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, 1,4-butanediol<br>
and 1,6-hexanediol. At least a portion of the polyol is a 1,3-polyol such as<br>
trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, ditrimethylolpropane and dipentaerythritol.<br>
[0021]	The esterification reaction is carried out in accordance with<br>
techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry and a detailed discussion is not believed to be necessary. Generally, the reaction can be conducted by combining the ingredients and heating to a temperature of about 160°C. to about 230 °C. Further details of the esterification process are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,802 at column 3, lines 4-20 and 39-45.<br>
[0022]	The ester and boric acid or its equivalent can be reacted under<br>
condensation reaction conditions well known in the art. For example, mixing boric acid or a boric acid equivalent with a hydroxyl functional polyester and removing water by distillation either directly or in combination with a solvent. Other methods tor preparing boric acid esters can be found in Kirk-Othmer<br>
"Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology", 4th edition, Vol 4, p 416; John Wiley and sons; 1992.<br>
[0023]	Also, it should be understood that the boron-ester can be formed<br>
in situ. That is, the composition from which one or both of the first and second<br>
polymeric layers is formed can comprise boric acid and/or its equivalent and<br>
the ester-containing material, such as a hydroxyl functional polyester, as<br>
separate hydroxyl functional groups, as separate components. The adhesion<br>
promoter can then be formed by forming the reaction product within the<br>
composition at ambient temperature or as the composition undergoes a curing<br>
reaction at elevated temperatures. In this instance, the composition can<br>
comprise the reaction product and the boric acid or its equivalent and the<br>
ester-containing material as separate components.<br>
[0024]	The amounts of boric acid or its equivalent and the hydroxyl<br>
functional ester that are used in the adhesion-promoting agent may vary. In<br>
alternate non-limiting embodiments, the amount of boric acid or its equivalent<br>
thereof to hydroxyl, on an equivalent basis, may be greater than 0.1:1, or at<br>
least 0.2:1, or from 0.3 to 1.25:1. Equivalent ratios less than 0.2:1 can result<br>
in poor intercoat adhesion. Ratios greater than 1.25:1 can be used but no<br>
added benefits have been observed at such higher ratios.<br>
[0025]	The relative amounts of polyol and acid that are used to form the<br>
ester may vary. In a non-limiting embodiment, the amount of polyol and acid can be on a hydroxyl to acid equivalent ratio basis greater than 1:1. In further embodiment, the equivalent ratio of 1,3-polyol to acid can be greater than 2:1, or at least 3:1. If the equivalent ratio of 1,3-polyol to acid is 2:1 or less, intercoat adhesion can be poor.<br>
[0026]	Although not intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed<br>
the polyester is a surface active agent causing the boron to migrate to the surface regions of the polymeric layer in which the adhesion promoter is contained and where the adhesion promoter is most effective in promoting interlayer adhesion. It is further believed that the use of boric acid without the polyester is not as effective as an adhesion promoter.<br>
 [0027]	In an embodiment, the present invention is directed to a multi-<br>
layer composite of two or more polymeric layers at least one of which is<br>
formed from a thermosetting composition. The composite comprises a first<br>
polymeric layer formed on a substrate and a second polymeric layer over at<br>
least a portion of said first polymeric layer, wherein in the absence of the<br>
adhesion promoter, the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer<br>
have poor interlayer adhesion. The inclusion of adhesion-promoting agent in<br>
one or both of the first and second polymeric layers in a sufficient amount<br>
improves the interlayer adhesion of the first and second polymeric layers.<br>
[0028]	In a non-limiting embodiment, the first polymeric layer can<br>
comprise a primer-surfacer coating and the second polymeric layer can comprise a color-enhancing base coating to which has been subsequently applied a transparent top coat. In another embodiment, the first polymeric layer can comprise an electrodepositable primer coating and the second polymeric layer can comprise a primer-surfacer coating to which has been subsequently applied an appearance enhancing monocoat or a color-plus-clear coating system. In a further embodiment, the first polymeric layer can comprise a transparent clear coat (such as the clear coat in a color-plus-clear coating system) and the second polymeric layer can comprise a repair clear coat or can comprise an adhesive layer such as but not limited to a windshield trim adhesive that is applied to a portion (such as the perimeter) of the clear coat.<br>
[0029]	The substrate upon which the first polymeric layer has been<br>
formed can include a variety of known materials. Non-limiting examples can include a metallic or elastomeric substrate. In an embodiment of the present invention, the first polymeric layer can comprise an electrodepositable primer coating applied to a metallic substrate. In another embodiment, the substrate can comprise a metallic substrate having an electrodepositable primer layer deposited thereon, and optionally a primer-surfacer coating deposited over the electrodepositable primer. In this case, the first polymeric layer can comprise, for example, a pigmented base coat deposited over the<br>
-8-<br><br>
electrodeposited primer or the primer-surfacer, and the second polymeric layer can comprise a substantially pigment-free clear coat formed over the pigmented base coat.<br>
[0030]	In one embodiment of the present invention, the substrate can<br>
comprise a metallic substrate. Examples of suitable metallic substrates can include ferrous metals and non-ferrous metals. Suitable ferrous metals include iron, steel, and alloys thereof. Non-limiting examples of useful steel materials include cold-rolled steel, galvanized (zinc coated) steel, electrogalvanized steel, stainless steel, pickled steel, GALVANNEAL®, GALVALUME®, and GALVAN® zinc-aluminum alloys coated upon steel, and combinations thereof. Useful non-ferrous metals include aluminum, zinc, magnesium and alloys thereof. Combinations or composites of ferrous and non-ferrous metals can also be used.<br>
[0031]	In another embodiment of the present invention, the substrate<br>
can comprise an elastomeric substrate. Suitable elastomeric substrates can<br>
include any of the thermoplastic or thermoset synthetic materials well known<br>
in the art. Nonlimiting examples of suitable flexible elastomeric substrate<br>
materials include polyethylene, polypropylene, thermoplastic polyolefin<br>
("TPO"), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene ("ABS") copolymers, ethylene<br>
propylene diene terpolymer ("EPDM") rubber, reaction injected molded<br>
polyurethane ("RIM") and thermoplastic polyurethane ("TPU").<br>
[0032]	When the substrates are used as components to fabricate<br>
automotive vehicles (including, but not limited to, automobiles, trucks and tractors) they can have any shape, and can be selected from the metallic and/or flexible substrates described above. Typical shapes of automotive body components can include body side moldings, fenders, bumpers, hoods, and trim for automotive vehicles.<br>
[0033]	In the absence of the adhesion-promoting agent, the first<br>
polymeric layer and said second polymeric layer can have poor interlayer adhesion. That is, in the absence of a boron-containing compound present in either of the first polymeric layer or the second polymeric layer, the two layers<br>
have poor interlayer (i.e., intercoat) adhesion. As used herein, by "poor<br>
interlayer adhesion" is meant that the second polymeric layer will have<br>
delamination or adhesion loss from the first polymeric layer sufficient to be<br>
given a rating of 3 or lower, as determined in accordance with ASTM-D 3359-<br>
97, method B, using the rating scale specified therein.<br>
[0034]	In an embodiment of the present invention, an adhesion-<br>
promoting agent can be included in one or both of the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer in an amount sufficient to improve the interlayer adhesion of the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer. The adhesion promoter can be present in the first polymeric layer only, the second polymeric layer only, or, alternatively, in both the first polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer.<br>
[0035]	In further embodiments, the adhesion promoter, for example, a<br>
boron-containing compound, can be present in any of the polymeric layers<br>
comprising the substrate over at least a portion of which is formed the first<br>
polymeric layer, as well as any of the polymeric layers that can be<br>
subsequently formed over at least a portion of the second polymeric layer.<br>
[0036]	At least one of the first and second polymeric layers is formed<br>
from a thermosetting composition.<br>
[0037]	In one embodiment of the present invention, both the first<br>
polymeric layer and the second polymeric layer are formed from a<br>
thermosetting composition. In another embodiment, the thermosetting<br>
composition comprises a curable coating composition as described below.<br>
[0038]	As used herein, by "thermosetting composition" is meant one<br>
that sets irreversibly upon curing or crosslinking, wherein the polymer chains<br>
of the polymeric components are joined together by covalent bonds. This<br>
property is usually associated with a cross-linking reaction of the composition<br>
constituents often induced by heat or radiation.<br>
[0039]	In the present invention, thermosetting compositions, for<br>
example, curable coating compositions comprise (A) a film-forming polymer comprising reactive functional groups, (B) a curing agent having functional<br>
groups reactive with the functional groups of (A), and (C) the adhesion-promoting agent.<br>
[0040]	In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the adhesion promoter<br>
can be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide a boron content of at least 0.001 weight percent, or at least 0.025 weight percent, or at least 0.05 weight percent, or at least 0.10 weight percent, based on total weight of the resin solids present in the composition. In further embodiments, the adhesion promoter is present in amounts of 30 weight percent or less, or amounts of less than 25 weight percent, or less than 15 weight percent based on total weight of resin solids.<br>
[0041]	The film-forming polymer can be selected from polyether<br>
polymers, polyester polymers, acrylic polymers, silicon-based polymers,<br>
polyepoxide polymers, polyurethane polymers, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0042]	The film-forming polymer has a reactive functional group that<br>
can be selected from hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, isocyanate, blocked isocyanate, primary amine, secondary amine, amide, carbamate, urea, epoxy and compatible mixtures thereof.<br>
[0043]	By "compatible mixtures thereof" means functional groups that<br>
will not react with one another at room temperature. For example, hydroxyl<br>
and free isocyanate groups would not be a compatible mixture. However,<br>
hydroxyl and carbamate would be a compatible mixture.<br>
[0044]	Film-forming polymers suitable for use as the reactive functional<br>
group-containing film-forming polymer (A) in the present invention can include any of a variety of functional polymers known in the art. Non-limiting examples can include but are not limited to hydroxyl group-containing polymers such as acrylic polyols, polyester polyols, polyurethane polyols, polyether polyols, and mixtures thereof. In an embodiment of the present invention, the film-forming polymer can be an acrylic polyol having a hydroxyl equivalent weight of from 100 to 1000 grams per solid equivalent, or 150 to 500 grams per solid equivalent.<br>
 [0045]	Suitable hydroxyl group and/or carboxyl group-containing acrylic<br>
polymers can be prepared using conventional methods known in the art. In an embodiment, these polymers can be prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers and can be copolymers of (meth)acrylic acid and/or hydroxylalkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid with one or more other polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid including methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl (meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate and 2-ethyl hexylacrylate, and vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, and vinyl toluene. As used herein, "(meth)acrylate" and like terms is intended to include both acrylates and methacrylates.<br>
[0046]	In a further embodiment of the present invention, the acrylic<br>
polymer can be prepared from ethylenically unsaturated, beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers. Such monomers can be derived from the reaction of an ethylenically unsaturated acid functional monomer, such as monocarboxylic acids, for example, acrylic acid, and an epoxy compound that does not participate in the free radical initiated polymerization with the unsaturated acid monomer. Non-limiting examples of such epoxy compounds can include glycidyl ethers and esters. Suitable glycidyl ethers can include glycidyl ethers of alcohols and phenols such as but not limited to butyl glycidyl ether, octyl glycidyl ether, phenyl glycidyl ether and mixtures thereof. Suitable glycidyl esters can include those that are commercially available from Shell Chemical Company under the tradename CARDURA E; and from Exxon Chemical Company under the tradename GLYDEXX-10. The beta-hydroxy ester functional monomers can be prepared from an ethylenically unsaturated, epoxy functional monomer, for example glycidyl (meth)acrylate and allyl glycidyl ether, and a saturated carboxylic acid, such as a saturated monocarboxylic acid, for example isostearic acid.<br>
[0047]	Epoxy functional groups can be incorporated into the polymer<br>
prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers by copolymerizing oxirane group-containing monomers, for example glycidyl<br>
 (meth)acrylate and allyl glycidyl ether, with other polymerizable ethylenically<br>
unsaturated monomers, such as those discussed above. Preparation of such<br>
epoxy functional acrylic polymers is described in detail in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,001,156 at columns 3 to 6, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0048]	Carbamate functional groups can be incorporated into the<br>
polymer prepared from polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers by copolymerizing, for example, the above-described ethylenically unsaturated monomers with a carbamate functional vinyl monomer such as a carbamate functional alkyl ester of methacrylic acid. Useful carbamate functional alkyl esters can be prepared by reacting, for example, a hydroxyalkyl carbamate, such as the reaction product of ammonia and ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate, with methacrylic anhydride. Other useful carbamate functional vinyl monomers include, for example, the reaction product of hydroxyethyl methacrylate, isophorone diisocyanate, and hydroxypropyl carbamate; or the reaction product of hydroxypropyl methacrylate, isophorone diisocyanate, and methanol.

[0049]	Carbamate functional groups can also be incorporated into the<br>
acrylic polymer by reacting a hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer with a low molecular weight alkyl carbamate such as methyl carbamate. Pendant carbamate groups can also be incorporated into the acrylic polymer by a "transcarbamoylation" reaction in which a hydroxyl functional acrylic polymer is reacted with a low molecular weight carbamate derived from an alcohol or a glycol ether. The carbamate groups exchange with the hydroxyl groups yielding the carbamate functional acrylic polymer and the original alcohol or glycol ether. Also, hydroxyl functional acrylic polymers can be reacted with isocyanic acid to provide pendent carbamate groups. Likewise, hydroxyl<br>
functional acrylic polymers can be reacted with urea to provide pendent carbamate groups.<br>

[0080]	In an embodiment, the present invention is directed to a multi-<br>
layer composite coating wherein the first curable coating composition comprises a color-imparting, pigmented base coating composition and the second curable composition comprises a substantially pigment-free clear coating composition.<br>
[0081]	As used herein, by "substantially pigment-free clear coating<br>
composition" is meant a coating composition that forms a transparent coating.<br>
Such compositions are sufficiently free of pigment or particles such that the<br>
optical properties of the resultant coatings are not seriously compromised. As<br>
used herein, "transparent" means that the cured coating has a BYK Haze<br>
index of less than 50 as measured using a BYK/Haze Gloss instrument.<br>
[0082]	The pigment-containing coating compositions can be selected<br>
from any of the pigmented compositions used in the coatings industry. In an embodiment, the pigment-containing coating composition can comprise a primer coating composition, such as a pigmented thermosetting weldable primer coating composition, for example, those commercially available under the tradename BONAZINC®, an electrodepositable coating composition such as ED-5000, a primer-surfacer coating composition such as GPX45379, a color-providing base coat such as HWB-9517, and ODCT-6373, all available from PPG Industries, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

pigment-free coatings known in the art. In an embodiment, the pigment-free<br>
coating can include clear coats used in color-plus-clear coating systems for<br>
the automotive industry. Non-limiting examples can include TKU1050AR,<br>
ODCT-8000, and those available under the tradename DIAMOND COAT®<br>
and NCT®, all commercially available from PPG Industries, Inc.<br>
[0084]	The basecoat compositions can be applied to the substrate by<br>
any conventional coating technique such as brushing, spraying, dipping, or flowing. Spray techniques and equipment for air spraying, airless spray, and electrostatic spraying in either manual or automatic methods, as known in the art can be used.<br>
[0085]	In alternate embodiments, during application of the basecoat to<br>
the substrate, the film thickness of the basecoat formed on the substrate can<br>
range from 0.1 to 5 mils, or from 0.1 to 1 mils, or it can be 0.4 mils.<br>
[0086]	After forming a film of the basecoat on the substrate, the<br>
basecoat can be cured or alternatively given a drying step in which solvent is<br>
driven out of the basecoat film by heating or an air drying period before<br>
application of the clearcoat. Suitable drying conditions may depend on the<br>
particular basecoat composition, and on the ambient humidity if the<br>
composition is water-borne. In an embodiment, a drying time of from 1 to 15<br>
minutes at a temperature of 75° to 200°F (21 ° to 93°C) can be used.<br>
[0087]	The transparent or clear topcoat composition can be applied to<br>
the basecoat by any conventional coating technique, including, but not limited<br>
to, compressed air spraying, electrostatic spraying, and either manual or<br>
automatic methods. The transparent topcoat can be applied to a cured or to a<br>
dried basecoat before the basecoat has been cured. In the latter instance,<br>
the two coatings can then be heated to cure both coating layers<br>
simultaneously. In an embodiment, curing conditions can range from 50°F to<br>
475°F (10°C to 246°C) for 1 to 30 minutes. In a further embodiment, the<br>
clearcoating thickness (dry film thickness) can be from 1 to 6 mils.<br>
[0088]	In an embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method<br>
of repairing a multi-layer composite coating comprising a base coat formed on<br>
a substrate from a film-forming base coating composition and a first top coat<br>
deposited over at least a portion of the base coat, the first top coat formed<br>
from a first film-forming top coating composition comprising any of the<br>
foregoing coating compositions, the method comprising locating an area of<br>
the composite coating which is flawed, and applying a repair top coat film-<br>
forming composition to the flawed area after the flawed area has been<br>
prepared for repairing. The repair topcoat film-forming composition can<br>
comprise a film-forming composition which is the same or different from the<br>
first topcoat film-forming composition. The flawed area can be any coating<br>
blemish that cannot be polished out, such as but not limited to dirt particles in<br>
the coating surface. The flawed area can be abraded or sanded to remove<br>
such coating blemishes. In a repair carried out in accordance with the method<br>
of the present invention, the first top coating can provide excellent intercoat<br>
adhesion with the subsequently applied repair top coating.<br>
[0089]	The coating compositions of the present invention can provide<br>
cured coatings having excellent intercoat or interlayer adhesion to subsequently applied coating layers. In an embodiment, any of the aforementioned substantially pigment-free coating compositions can be applied as a transparent clearcoat in a color-plus-clear coating system as discussed above. In the event of damage to the cured coating system causing a surface defect, it may be necessary to prepare the damaged area for repair with a subsequently applied clear coat composition. The coating compositions of the present invention can provide excellent intercoat adhesion between the first clear coat layer and the subsequently applied repair clear coat layer. When used as a topcoat composition, the coating compositions of the present invention also provide excellent interlayer adhesion between the cured topcoat and a subsequently applied windshield adhesive without the intervening step of applying an adhesion-promoting primer.<br>

[00144]	The film forming compositions of Examples 1 -24 were spray<br>
applied to a pigmented basecoat to form color-plus-clear composite coatings over primed electrocoated steel panels. The panels used were cold rolled steel panels (size 4 inches x 12 inches (10.16 cm by 30.48 cm)). Panels for Examples 1 through 4 were coated with ED6060 electrocoat and 1177225A primer, both available from PPG Industries, Inc. For Examples 5 through 24, panels were<br>
coated with ED6230B electrocoat and FCP6519 primer, both available from PPG Industries, Inc.<br>
[00145]	Examples 1 through 4 used Reflex Silver, a silver-pigmented<br>
water-borne basecoat, available from PPG Industries, Inc. A black-pigmented solvent-based acrylic/melamine basecoat, DCT6373, available from PPG Industries, Inc. was used for examples 5-24.<br>
[00146]	Basecoats were automated spray applied to the electrocoated and<br>
primed steel panels at ambient temperature (about 70 °F (21 °C)). A dry film thickness of about 0.6 to 0.8 mils (about 15 to 20 micrometers) was targeted for the basecoats. The water-borne basecoat panels were dehydrated for 10 minutes @ 176Q F (80 2C) prior to clearcoat application. The solvent-borne basecoat panels were only given an air flash at ambient temperature for one to five minutes.<br>
[00147]	The clear coating compositions were each automated spray<br>
applied to a basecoated panel at ambient temperature in two coats with an ambient flash between applications. Clearcoats were targeted for a 1.6 to 1.8 mils (about 41 to 46 micrometers) dry film thickness. All coatings were allowed to air flash at ambient temperature before the oven. Panels were baked for thirty minutes at 285 °F (141 °C) to fully cure the coating(s). The panels were baked in a horizontal position. To test for recoat adhesion, an original basecoated and clearcoated panel, as described above, was given another layer of basecoat and clearcoat or clearcoat only. Half of an original panel from each clear coating was basecoated and clearcoated and the other half of the panel was clearcoated only. To recoat the panels (1-4) half and half, the bottom halves of the originals were covered with aluminum foil and then the Reflex Silver basecoat were automated spray applied as described above. The foil was removed, resulting in an original panel with the upper half coated in basecoat and the bottom half still with only the original coatings layers. The respective clearcoat was then automated spray applied to the entire panel as described above. The resulting panels were half coated in basecoat/clearcoat from the original spray application and another layer of basecoat/clearcoat from the recoat spray applications<br>
 (B/C//B/C). The other half of the resulting panel was coated in basecoat/clearcoat from the original spray application and another layer of clearcoat from the recoat spray application (B/C//C). Properties for the coatings are reported below in Tables 3, 4 and 6.<br>

3 Quick Knife Testing was performed as follows: In order to test for windshield adhesion, a bead of windshield adhesive is applied to the clear coat surface within 1-4 hours following the final bake (30 minutes at 285 °F). The Betaseal urethane moisture cure windshield adhesive 15625 obtained from Dow Automotive was used. Approximately a 5mm x 5mm x 250mm adhesive bead is placed on the cured color plus clear substrate. The adhesive is cured for 72 hours at room temperature (-75 °F) and 20-50% relative humidity. After 72 hours, the cured adhesive bead is cut with a razor blade. A cut is made through the adhesive bead at a 60° angle at 12mm intervals while pulling back the edge of the adhesive at a 180° angle. A minimum of 10 cuts is done for each system. The desired result is described as 90-100% cohesive failure (CF). Cohesive failure (CF) occurs when the integrity of the adhesive bead is lost as a result of cutting and pulling. When adhesion loss occurs between the adhesive bead and clearcoat surface, the cohesive failure rating is 0%.<br>
[00148]	The results summarized in Table 3 show that the adhesion-<br>
promoting agent of the invention (Examples 2, 3 and 4) at various levels (5.8-17.3% by weight solids) provide superior recoat adhesion without adversely affecting appearance compared to the control which did not contain the adhesion promoting agent.<br>
[00149]	The results summarized in Table 4 show that the various additives<br>
of the invention (Examples 11-18) provide superior adhesion to the comparative examples (5-10) that contained additives outside the scope of the invention. In Examples 11-17, appearance was not adversely affected. However, in Example 18, appearance was adversely affected.<br>
[00150]	The results summarized in Table 6 show that the boron to hydroxy<br>
equivalent ratio in the borated polyester should be greater than 0.10.<br>
