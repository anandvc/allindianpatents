This invention relates to a motor cycle incorporating a device for mounting the end portion of a fender thereof, such as, the front portion of the rear fender. In this Specification the term "motor cycle" not only includes a motor cycle popularly so called, but also the scooter type of motor vehicle.<br>
Mounting devices for fenders of motorcycles known to the art consist of metal brackets which are attached by bolts and nuts or screws to the frame of the vehicle. Such attachment is usually done by the use of screw drivers, spanners and like hand tools. These devices are cumbersome in installation apart from being prone to corrosion over a period of time, especially since these are located at a place in the vehicle which is exposed to splashes of mud and slush.<br>
This invention, however, proposes a motor cycle incorporating a device which is quickly and easily assembled in place and as quickly and easily disassembled. For assembly and disassembly no hand tools are required.<br><br>
It is preferred to make the said device out of plastic since it is readily made out of this material and. when so made, it is corrosion-proof, lightweight and of low cost. It is however to be noted that other materials can also be used to manufacture the proposed device.<br>
Other advantages of the proposed device will be discernible from the following further description thereof.<br>
The motorcycle incorporating a device for mounting the end portion of a fender thereof, according to this invention, has a slot in the said portion of the fender and a buckle fixed to the frame of the motorcycle; a strip, the first end of which is provided with a hook for engaging with the buckle, the second end of the strip being provided with a resilient cleft portion provided with top stoppers and bottom stoppers on either side of the cleft, the said cleft portion forming a resilient push-fit within.the slot, such that whenever the cleft portion is laterally compressed, to constrict it,  and thrust into the slot,  the said<br><br>
cleft portion resiliently expands after entering the slot, with the top stoppers butting against the upper surface of the fender, thereby preventing the strip from being thrust further into the slot, and the bottom stoppers simultaneously butting against the lower surface of the fender, thereby preventing the strip from coming out of the slot, the strip, however, being withdrawable from the slot whenever laterally compressed at the cleft portion, to constrict it-<br>
The device proposed herein will now be described With reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of this invention.<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrating front and rear views of the<br>
strip<br>
Fig. 3 illustrating the strip with its hook at its one<br>
end engaging with the buckle and the cleft portion<br>
located in the slot in the front portion of the rear<br>
fender.<br>
Fig.4  illustrating an enlarged view of the cleft<br>
portion located in the slot.<br><br>
A Slot S is provided in the front portion of the rear fender F of the motor cycle and a buckle B is fixed to the frame G of the vehicle.<br>
The first end of a strip E is provided with a hook H for engaging with the buckle B, the second end of the strip having a resilient cleft portion C provided with top stoppers T and bottom stoppers P on either side of the cleft-<br>
The said cleft portion C forms a push-fit within the slot S of the fender F such that whenever the cleft portion is laterally compressed resiliently (in the direction of the arrows A) to constrict it, and then thrust into the slot and released, the said cleft portion resiliently expands on entering the slot, whereby the top stoppers butt against the upper surface of the fender, preventing the strip E from being thrust further into the slot. Simultaneously, the bottom stoppers butt against the lower surface of the fender, preventing the strip E from coming out of the slot-<br>
The strip E can, however, be withdrawn from the slot.<br><br>
when necessary, by laterally compressing the cleft portion C resiliently, to constrict it, thus enabling the same to be removed from the slot.<br>
The cleft portion C terminates in two lateral tapered surfaces Q which facilitate the lateral compression of the cleft portion to constrict it, whenever the cleft portion is thrust into the slot. In other words, as the cleft portion is thrust into the slot, by reason of the tapered surfaces Q being urged into the slot, the cleft portion C gets laterally compressed and thus constricted to enter the slot as herein above described.<br>
The front portion of the rear fender is now firmly mounted in position.<br>
The strip on one or both sides has a raised portion W to act as a stiffener, to provide sufficient stiffness to  its  body. â€¢<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation as these are not intended to exclude any equivalents of the features<br><br>
illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of this invention are possible without departing from the scope and ambit thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1* A motorcycle incorporating a device for mounting the end portion of a fender thereof has a slot in the said portion of the fender and a buckle fixed to the frame of the motorcycle; a strip, the first end of which is provided with a hook for engaging with the buckle, the second end of the strip being provided with a resilient cleft portion provided with top stoppers and bottom stoppers on either side of the cleft, the said cleft portion forming a resilient push-fit within the slot, such that whenever the cleft portion is laterally compressed, to constrict it, and thrust into the slot, the said cleft portion resiliently expands after entering the slot, with the top stoppers butting against the upper surface of the fender, thereby preventing the strip from being thrust further into the slot, and the bottom stoppers simultan^usly butting against the lower surface of the fender, thereby preventing the strip from coming out of the slot, the strip, however, being withdrawable from the slot whenever laterally compressed at the cleft portion,  to<br><br>
constrict it.<br>
2.	A motor cycle as claimed in Claim 1 wherein<br>
at least one of the sides of the strip has a raised<br>
portion acting as a stiffener.<br>
3.	A motor cycle as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the cleft portion terminates in two lateral tapered surfaces which facilitate the thrusting of the said cleft portion into the slot.<br>
4.	A motor cycle as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein the strip is made of an anti-corrosion material.<br>
5.	A motor cycle as claimed in Claim 4 wherein<br>
the strip is made of plastic.<br>
6  .        A motor cycle incorporating a device for mounting  the end portion of a  fender  thereof,<br>
*<br>
substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br><br></td>
