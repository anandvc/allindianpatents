				<td>Description<br>
Rail vehicle with a wagon body and method for protectively-<br>
grounding such a wagon body<br>
The invention relates to a rail vehicle with a wagon body and<br>
with contact means, for example wheels or wheel sets, which are<br>
connected to the wagon body and which are in contact with at<br>
least one rail on the track side during operation of the rail<br>
vehicle, wherein the wagon body and at least one of the contact<br>
means are connected to one another by means of an electrical<br>
resistor device.<br>
Grounding concepts of contemporary electrical and diesel-<br>
electrical rail vehicles or railway vehicles must equally meet<br>
both the requirements which are made in terms of fault-free<br>
operational current feedback into the rail - that is to say the<br>
operational grounding - and the requirements made in terms of<br>
effective protection against electrical shocks, that is to say<br>
the protective grounding.<br>
The protection against electrical shocks requires all the<br>
metallic parts of the wagon body which could be connected to a<br>
voltage in the case of a fault to be connected with as low an<br>
impedance as possible to the railway ground, i.e. for example<br>
to the rails. Such a fault situation could take the form, for<br>
example, of a contact wire tearing off an overhead line of the<br>
route and entering into contact with the wagon body. In such a<br>
case, the wagon body would in fact be connected to a high<br>
voltage if no efficient protective grounding were provided.<br>
Protective grounding is implemented in previously known rail<br>
vehicles using, for example, ground cables which are connected<br>
to the wheel set contacts of the rail vehicle.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a rail<br>
vehicle which has even better grounding behavior than previous<br>
rail vehicles.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by means of<br>
a rail vehicle having the features of claim 1. Advantageous<br>
refinements of the rail vehicle according to the invention are<br>
disclosed in the subclaims.<br>
According to the above, the invention provides that the<br>
resistor device has a larger electrical resistance in a voltage<br>
range with a low voltage than in a voltage range with a voltage<br>
which is higher in comparison.<br>
A significant advantage of the rail vehicle according to the<br>
invention is to be seen in the fact that the resistor device<br>
has two different ranges or operating modes, specifically an<br>
operating mode with a large electrical resistance and an<br>
operating mode with a resistance which is relatively low<br>
compared thereto. In the normal operating mode of the rail<br>
vehicle, that is to say when there is no high voltage applied<br>
to the wagon body, very low impedance protective grounding of<br>
the wagon body is not required and is in some cases<br>
disadvantageous for the operating behavior of the rail vehicle.<br>
If, in fact, the electrical resistance between the wagon body<br>
and the ground or the rails is too low, there may be<br>
penetration by electrical parallel currents from the track, for<br>
example by currents from other rail vehicles which are in the<br>
same track circuit. Such inputting of parallel currents will<br>
occur, in particular, if the electrical resistance of the rails<br>
on the track side is greater than the electrical resistance of<br>
the rail vehicle, or its wagon body, located thereon; this is<br>
because the electric current will be divided between the wagon<br>
body and rail in accordance with the component resistances. In<br>
order to prevent such penetration of undesired current into the<br>
wagon body, the grounding resistance for grounding the wagon<br>
body should be as large as possible, and at the same time the<br>
grounding resistance between the wagon body and the rails on<br>
the track side must, of course, not be too large, since<br>
otherwise there would be no efficient protective grounding in<br>
the case of a high voltage at the wagon body,<br>
since the voltage drop at a high impedance grounding resistance<br>
would be too large.<br>
This is where the invention comes in, in that the invention<br>
provides that a resistor device with a nonlinear behavior is to<br>
be connected between the wagon body and the rails on the track<br>
side, which resistor device has two different electrical<br>
resistances or resistance ranges, specifically a high impedance<br>
resistance for the normal operating mode of the rail vehicle<br>
and a low impedance resistance range for the case of a high<br>
voltage accident.<br>
In particular in the case of long rail vehicles, the described<br>
resistor device is advantageous because of the fact that the<br>
problem of the inputting of parallel currents into the wagon<br>
body occurs, or can occur, very frequently in such vehicles.<br>
"Long" rail vehicles are to be understood, for example, as<br>
being rail vehicles which have a length over 15 m, in<br>
particular over 20 m. Such rail vehicles may be formed, for<br>
example, by relatively long individual vehicles, by traction<br>
units or else by "normal" trains which have electrically<br>
through-connected wagons and therefore form a uniform rail<br>
vehicle, viewed in electrical terms.<br>
The contact means with which the rail vehicle forms electrical<br>
contact with the rails on the track side can be formed, for<br>
example, by means of wheels, wheel sets, under carriages or<br>
bogies of the rail vehicle.<br>
The resistor device is preferably dimensioned in such a way<br>
that an electrical resistance between 33 mO and 100 mO occurs<br>
at voltages below a predefined first limiting voltage, in<br>
particular below 100 volts apex value, and that in the case of<br>
voltages which correspond to the operating voltage of the rail<br>
vehicle a maximum electrical resistance of 10 mO occurs.<br>
The resistor device can be formed particularly easily and<br>
therefore advantageously by means of an ohmic resistance<br>
element and a nonlinear element which is connected electrically<br>
parallel thereto. Such a nonlinear element can be formed, for<br>
example, by means of a voltage arrestor, in particular a spark<br>
gap, which is activated or fired, when a predefined minimum<br>
voltage or firing voltage is applied.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the resistor device can also<br>
comprise a varistor which has a lower electrical resistance at<br>
relatively high voltages than at low electrical voltages.<br>
It is also possible for the resistor device to have a<br>
semiconductor circuit which, when an electrical voltage is<br>
applied to external terminals of the semiconductor circuit<br>
turns on when the voltage exceeds a predefined turn-voltage,<br>
and in doing so reduces the resistance thereof between its<br>
external terminals.<br>
As already stated above, the large electrical resistance<br>
element serves to avoid parallel currents from being input in<br>
the case of low wagon body voltages or in the normal operating<br>
mode. For this reason, it is considered particularly<br>
advantageous if, at least in the central region of the rail<br>
vehicle, a corresponding nonlinear resistor device is connected<br>
to the wagon body; this is because the inputting of parallel<br>
currents is relevant in particular in the case of relatively<br>
long electrical lines in the wagon body unless such inputting<br>
is prevented by means of a correspondingly large ohmic<br>
resistance element between the wagon body and rails.<br>
All the contact means which produce electrical contact with the<br>
rails are particularly preferably connected to the wagon body<br>
by means of a corresponding resistor device with nonlinear<br>
behavior.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for protectively-<br>
grounding a wagon body of a rail vehicle, in which the wagon<br>
body is grounded via at least one electrical contact means with<br>
at least one rail on the track side.<br>
In order to ensure reliable protective grounding and at the<br>
same time prevent parallel currents being input from a rail on<br>
the track side into the wagon body, or at least kept small, the<br>
invention provides that at least one resistor device is used<br>
for protectively grounding, which resistor device is connected<br>
between the wagon body and the at least one contact means and<br>
has a larger electrical resistance in a voltage range with a<br>
low voltage than in a voltage range with a voltage which is<br>
higher in comparison.<br>
With respect to the advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention, reference is made to the above statements in<br>
conjunction with the rail vehicle according to the invention<br>
singe the advantages of the rail vehicle according to the<br>
invention correspond essentially to those of the method<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to exemplary embodiments; in the drawings:<br>
figure 1 shows by way of example an exemplary embodiment of a<br>
rail vehicle according to the invention in<br>
longitudinal section on a rail on the track side,<br>
figure 2 shows by way of example the electrical behavior of a<br>
resistor device of the rail vehicle according to<br>
figure 1,<br>
figure 3 shows by way of example the rail vehicle according to<br>
figure 1 in cross section in a schematic<br>
illustration.<br>
For the sake of a clear overview, the same reference symbols<br>
are always used for identical or comparable components in<br>
figures 1 to 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rail vehicle 10 which is located on rails 15<br>
of a track bed 18. The rail vehicle 10 has wheels 20, 30, 40<br>
and 50 which produce electrical contact with the rails 15 of<br>
the track bed 18.<br>
In order to permit protective grounding of a wagon body 60 of<br>
the rail vehicle 10, individual wheels 20, 30, 40 and 50, or<br>
all thereof, are connected electrically to the wagon body 60.<br>
If an electrical current flows through the rails 15 of the<br>
track bed 18, as is indicated by the reference symbol Ig in<br>
figure 1, a part I1 of this current can be input into the wagon<br>
body 60 via the front wheels 20 and 30, and fed back into the<br>
track bed 18, again via the rear wheels 40 and 50. A proportion<br>
I1 of the total current Ig would therefore flow in the wagon<br>
body 60, specifically parallel to the component current I2<br>
which flows in the rails 15 of the track bed 18. The following<br>
applies here:<br>
Ig = I1 + I2<br>
The lower the electrical resistance of the wagon body 60 of the<br>
rail vehicle 10 compared to the electrical resistance of the<br>
rail 15, the larger the proportion I1 of current compared to<br>
the proportion I2 of current.<br>
In order to keep the proportion I1 of current in the wagon<br>
body 60 as low as possible, at least one of the wheels of the<br>
rail vehicle 10, particularly preferably each wheel, is<br>
respectively connected to the wagon body 60 via an electrical<br>
resistor device 70 which has a "nonlinear behavior" and a<br>
larger electrical resistance in a voltage range with a low<br>
voltage than in a voltage range with a voltage which is higher<br>
in comparison.<br>
The resistor device 70 ensures here that in the normal<br>
operating mode of the rail vehicle 10 a relatively large<br>
electrical resistance is brought about between the respectively-<br>
assigned wheel and the wagon body 60, with the result that the<br>
overall electrical resistance of the rail vehicle 10 becomes<br>
relatively large and the portion I1 of current remains<br>
relatively small compared to the portion I2 of current.<br>
Nevertheless, the resistor device 70 ensures efficient<br>
protective grounding of the wagon body 60 since, specifically<br>
in the case of a high voltage on a wagon body 60, said high<br>
voltage is passed on efficiently to the rails 15 and therefore<br>
into the track bed 18 via the resistor device 70. Such a high<br>
voltage could occur, for example, if a contact wire 80<br>
(illustrated only schematically in figure 1) of an overhead<br>
line drops onto the rail vehicle 10 and therefore places the<br>
wagon body 60 at a high voltage.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the electrical<br>
behavior of the resistor device 70 according to figure 1. The<br>
electrical profile of the electrical resistance R plotted<br>
against the voltage U dropping at the external terminals of the<br>
resistor device 70 is illustrated. It is apparent that in a<br>
lower voltage range dU1 below a voltage Us a relatively large<br>
electrical resistance R1 occurs, and in a relatively high<br>
voltage range dU2 above a threshold voltage Us the resistance<br>
drops to a value R2.<br>
Suitable value ranges for Us, Rl and R2 are, for example:<br>
dUl: 0 volt to 100 volts<br>
dU2: 100 volts to 100 kV<br>
R1: 33 mO to 100 mO<br>
R2: 0 O to 10 mO<br>
Us: between dU1 and dU2<br>
Electrical behavior such as is illustrated in figure 2 can be<br>
brought about, for example, by means of an ohmic resistance R1<br>
parallel to which a nonlinear element Rn1, such as for example<br>
an overvoltage arrestor or a spark gap, is connected (cf.<br>
figure 3). Alternatively, such a resistor device 70 can also<br>
comprise a varistor or a corresponding semiconductor circuit<br>
which brings about the correspondingly described electrical<br>
behavior.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates, by way of example, the rail vehicle 10<br>
according to figure 1 in cross section. It is possible to see<br>
the contact wire 80 with which it is possible to make contact<br>
with one of the two pantographs 90 which permit the rail<br>
vehicle 10 to operate either in the alternating current<br>
selectively operating mode or in the direct current operating<br>
mode.<br>
An actuation circuit 100, which is accommodated in an<br>
electrically screened container 110, is connected to the two<br>
pantographs 90. The actuation circuit 100 comprises, for<br>
example, a four quadrant chopper 120, a drive control<br>
device 130 and a pulse-controlled inverter 140.<br>
As is apparent in figure 1, the container 110 is electrically<br>
connected to the wagon body 60 of the rail vehicle 10; only a<br>
base plate of the wagon body 60 is shown by way of example in<br>
figure 3. The connection between the wagon body 60 and the<br>
container 110 is made via a grounding line 150.<br>
The wagon body 60 is connected via a pivot spindle 160 to a<br>
bogie 170 in which a traction motor 180 is also accommodated.<br>
The housing of the traction motor 180 is connected to the<br>
bogie 170 via a grounding line 185.<br>
The bogie 170 is supported mechanically, but in an electrically<br>
isolated fashion, by two wheels 20 and 20' which are connected<br>
by an axle 190. The axle 190 is connected via a<br>
transmission 200<br>
and a clutch 210 to the traction motor 180, wherein the housing<br>
of the traction motor 18 0 is isolated from the drive branch by-<br>
means of electrically isolated bearings 220.<br>
In figure 3, electrically isolated bearings are marked by a<br>
thicker line than electrically non-isolated bearings.<br>
Furthermore, conductive material is marked by hatching and<br>
nonconductive material 22 5 is marked in black.<br>
Furthermore, figure 3 shows a brake controller 230 which is<br>
connected to a rotational speed signal generator 24 0 which<br>
measures the rotational speed of the axle 190 and outputs<br>
corresponding signals. The brake controller 230 is electrically<br>
connected to the wagon body 60 via a grounding line 250.<br>
Figure 3 also shows an exemplary embodiment of the resistor<br>
device 70 according to figure 1. It is apparent that the<br>
resistor device 70 is electrically connected between the wagon<br>
body 60 and the axle 190 or the two wheels 20 and 20'. The<br>
resistor device 70 comprises an ohmic resistance element R1 and<br>
a nonlinear resistance element Rn1 which is connected parallel<br>
thereto and is formed, for example, by a spark gap.<br>
In the normal operating mode of the rail vehicle 10, the<br>
resistor device 70 has a relatively high electrical resistance<br>
Rl with the result that an undesired flow of current through<br>
the wheels 20 and 20' or the axle 190 and through the resistor<br>
device 7 0 into the wagon body 60 is avoided.<br>
In the case of a high voltage at the wagon body 60, such as<br>
could occur, for example, if the contact wire 80 drops to the<br>
wagon body 60 of the rail vehicle 10 or is placed in contact<br>
therewith, the high voltage is nevertheless efficiently<br>
diverted by the resistor device 70 because the latter assumes a<br>
low impedance specifically in the case of a spark flashover<br>
when there are high electrical voltages across the spark gap<br>
Rnl and diverts the high voltage via the wheels 20 and 20' or<br>
into the rails 50 of the track bed 18.<br>
