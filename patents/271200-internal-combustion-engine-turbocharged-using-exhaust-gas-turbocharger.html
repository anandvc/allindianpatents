				<td>Internal combustion engine turbocharged using exhaust gas turbocharger having an<br>
exhaust system having SCR catalyst(s)<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine turbocharged using an exhaust<br>
gas turbocharger having the features of the type specified in the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Technological background: ammonia (NH3) is used as a reducing agent for the selective<br>
catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO, in the exhaust gas and diesel engines. This ammonia is to<br>
be produced through thermolysis of a urea-water solution or solid urea. For this purpose,<br>
there are various possibilities and types of ammonia reactors. In the simplest case, a ureawater<br>
solution is sprayed directly into the hot exhaust gas before the SCR catalyst(s). This<br>
has the disadvantage that the proportion of vaporized water is low and even at temperatures<br>
of 400°C: only a slight decomposition of the urea into ammonia (NH,) and jsocyanic acid<br>
(HNCO) occurs, which lowers the efficiency of the SCR catalyst(s). Catalytic therrnolysis of<br>
the urea-water solution using a hydrolysis catalyst in the secondary flow or of solid urea in an<br>
ammonia reactor in an exhaust gas auxiliary flow as a water vapor carrier allow a high-quality<br>
production of ammonia free of isocyanic acid. Urea is a salt-like solid which melts at approximately<br>
133°C and vaporizes at temperatures between 350" - 400°C through rapid therrnolysis<br>
and forms ammonia (NH,) and isocyanic acid (HNCO) at the same time, according<br>
t 0<br>
(NHi.)2C0 -+ NH3 + HNCO.<br>
Because of the presence of water vapor in the ammonia reactor, the isocyanic acid is also<br>
converted in a second step into ammonia and carbon dioxide, according to<br>
HNCO + H20 - NH:, + COz.<br>
Due to the elimination of the isocyanic acid, which tends to polymerize, this reaction prevents<br>
the formation of solid decomposition products such as cyanuric'acid, and finally allows<br>
a gas mixture containing ammonia to be provided, which does not contain any components<br>
that tend to accumulate in the exhaust gas line.<br>
Hydrolysis catalysts are either used in externally heated ammonia reactors situated outside<br>
an exhaust gas line or internally by exhaust gas lines as ammonia reactors, which are then<br>
heated by exhaust gas. Such hydrolysis catalysts make the exhaus: gas posttreatment systems<br>
significantly more expensive than such systems which manage without these catalysts.<br>
In addition, hydrolysis catalysts situated after the exhaust gas turbocharger in the exhausi,<br>
gas line have exhaust gas applied to them whose temperature level has already been lowered<br>
a relatively large amount, depending on the load state of the internal combustion engine,<br>
even below a temperature at which favorable hydrolysis of the urea is no longer possible.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to show a way in which hydrolysis catalysts<br>
for ammonia production may be dispensed with, but the formation of harmful solid decomposition<br>
products is nonetheless avoidable<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention in accordance with the characteristics<br>
of Claim 1 in that the ammonia reactor is situated externally on the turbine housing of the<br>
exhaus: gas turbocharger - whose thermal radiation is used for ammonia production.<br>
The present invention proceeds from the following considerations<br>
If one wishes to dispense with electrical heating of the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber in<br>
external ammonia reactors, another available heat source must be sought. Heat sources<br>
which provide the required temperature, in the range of 400°C or higher, may only be found<br>
very close to the engine on an internal combustion engine and must participate in the combustion<br>
process or be situated directly downstream therefrom. The present invention makes<br>
use of the exhaust gas iurbocharger as a heat source in this regard, whose hot turbine housing<br>
outer wall causes rather high thermal radiation depending on the load state. This high<br>
thermal radiation is normally dissipated unused or is lowered by a cooling airflow to avoid<br>
heat damage in the surroundings.<br>
The present invention makes use of this high thermal radiation of the turbine housing outer<br>
wall by using it as a heat source for the ammonia production. For this purpose, an ammonia<br>
reactor is assigned directly thereto, Its vaporizat~onlhydrolysis chamber is accordingly heated<br>
by the thermal radiation of the turbine housing outer wall. Further heating of the vaporizatio~<br>
lhydrolysisc hamber is periormed by the exhaust gas applied thereto via a partial flow<br>
which - because it branches off before the exhaust gas turbine in its intake area or via a<br>
channel from the exhaust gas line or the exhaust gas manifold - still has a very high temperature<br>
level of approximately 700-750°C. This exhaust gas also flrnctions as a supplier.of the<br>
water vapor which is required for the conversion into NH: and COi of the isocyanic acid<br>
arising during the thermal decomposition of the urea, and thus contributes to preventing the<br>
occurrence of corrosively acting urea decomposition products such as cyanuric acid.<br>
The ammonia reactor is connected via a supply line to a dosing unit and this unit is connected<br>
in turn to a storage container either for a urea-water solution or solid urea, preferably<br>
spherical urea prills of premade size. Using the dosing unit, the relevant solid or liquid operating<br>
material is sprayed or injected in a regulated quantity via the supply line at a suitable<br>
point into the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber of the ammonia reactor.<br>
There are multiple possibilities for positioning or implementing the ammonia reactor on the<br>
turbine housing of the exhaust gas turbocharger.<br>
One possibility is to unify the ammonia reactor with the construction of the turbine housins of<br>
the exhaust gas turbocharger to form a unit in such a way that the vaporizationlhydrolysis<br>
chamber is delimited on the inside by the turbine housing outer wall and on the outside by a<br>
reactor outer wall cast thereon.<br>
Another possibility, which is less favorable, is to produce the ammonia reactor having a<br>
closed housing, comprising the vaporizatronlhydrolysis chamber, as a modular unit and then<br>
to attach it externally to the turbine housing of the exhaust gas turbocharger. At least the<br>
inner wall of the reactor housing is made of corrosion-proof metallic material which is resistant<br>
to high temperatures and is highly thermally conductive. This inner wall of the reactor<br>
housing is exactly tailored to the external shape of the turbine housing outer wall, so that in<br>
the installed position of the ammonia reactor, it presses intimately against the turbine housing<br>
outer wall and absprbs its thermal radiation.<br>
The situation according to the present invention of the ammonia reactor externally on the<br>
turbine housing of the exhaust gas turbocharger also has the additional effect that the ammonia<br>
reactor practically also forms a heat shield, through which the thermal shielding<br>
measures may be simplified and the cooling fan output may be reduced.<br>
Further details and embodiments of the achievement of the object according to the present<br>
invention are characterized in the subclaims.<br>
In the following, the present invention is explained ir, greater detail on the basis of multiple<br>
examples illustrated in the drawing.<br>
In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1 shows a section through a turbocharger having an ammonia reactor whose construction<br>
is unified with the turbine housing,<br>
Figure 2 shows a section through a turbocharger having another embodiment of an ammonia<br>
reactor whose construction is unified with the turbine housing,<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a cross section through a turbine housing of a turbocharger<br>
having an ammonia reactor whose construction is unified therewith,<br>
Figure 4 shows an example of a nozzle or a channel end piece, and<br>
Figure 5 shows an associated nozzle or channel end piece support.<br>
In the drawing, an exhaust gas turbocharger is identified by 1, its exhaust gas turbine by 2,<br>
and its compressor by 3. Only the exhaust gas turbine 2 is of interest in connection with the<br>
present invention. Its turbine wheel is identified by 4 and its turbine housing by 5. Its outer<br>
wall is identified by 6: the turbine inlet by 7, and the turbine outlet by 8.<br>
The turbine inlet 7 of the exhaust gas turbine 2 is connected to an exhaust gas line section,<br>
such as the manifold or exhaust gas collecting line, via which it is supplied with the exhaust<br>
gas expelled by an internal combustion engine (also not shown), particularly a diesel engine<br>
of a vehicle as shown by arrow 9. At the outlet 8 of the exhaust gas turbine 2, an exhaust gas<br>
line ID is connected, in which an exhaust gas posttreatment unit, having at least one SCR<br>
catalyst and at least one muffler, is situated downstream from the exhaust gas turbocharger.<br>
The compressor 3 of the exhaust gas turbocharger sucks in filtered air, compresses it, and<br>
then supplies it via a charge air line to the internal combustion engine.<br>
An ammonia reactor 11 is situated externally according to the present invention on the turbine<br>
housing 5 - whose thermal radiation is used for ammonia production. It has a vaporizationlhydrolysis<br>
chamber 12, into which either a urea-water solution or solid urea, e.g., in the<br>
form of prernade, spherical urea prills, is fed in a dosed quantity at a suitable point 13.<br>
As shown in Figure 2: this operating materia! - urea prills or urea-water solution - is stored in<br>
a storage container 14 and fed using a dosing unit 15 in a quantity regulated in regard to the<br>
ammonia demand via a supply line 16 and 2 nozzle 17 into the vaporizationlhydrolysis chamber<br>
12<br>
In the examples shown, the ammonia reactor 11 according to the present invention forms a<br>
modular unit with the turbine housing 5 of the exhaust gas turbocharger 1, in which the vaporizationlhydrolysis<br>
chamber 12 is delimited on the 'inside by the turbine housing outer wall<br>
6 and on the outside by a reactor outer wall 18 cast onto the latter.<br>
Ir; an alternative construct~on (not shown). the ammonia reactor 11 may be pre-manufactured<br>
as a separate unit and then attached to the tilrbine housing 5. In this case, the ammonia reactor<br>
11 has a closed housing which comprises the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber. At least<br>
the inner wall of the reactor housing is made of corrosion-proof metallic material which is<br>
resistant to high temperatures and is highly thermal conductive. This inner wall of the reactor<br>
housing is exactly tailored to the external shape of the turbine housing outer wall 6, so that it<br>
presses intimately against the turbine housing outer wall 6 in the installed position of the<br>
ammonia reactor, preferably with contact.<br>
Independently of the type of implementation of the ammonia reactor 11, its vaporizaiionlhydrolysis<br>
chamber 12 is connected via a channel 19 (see Figure 3) to the exhaust gas<br>
path before or at the intake of the turbine 2 of the exhaust gas turbocharger I . Via this channel<br>
19, the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber 12 may be supplied with an exhaust gas partial<br>
flow. \~hichis used both to in,zrease the temperature in the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber<br>
12 and also as a source for ,water vapor, which is used for complete conversion of the isgcyanic<br>
acid initially arising during the ammonia production into ammonia and carbon diox-<br>
~de.<br>
In the case of the examples shown in Figures 1 through 3, the channel 19 is implemented by<br>
a hole in the inlet area 7 of the turbine housing, which discharges into the vaporizaiionlhydrolysis<br>
chamber 12. In the above-mentioned alternative implementation of the ammonia<br>
reactor 11, the channel 19 would be implemented via a pipeline,<br>
The channel 19 may be implemented as a connection which is permanently permeable to a<br>
specific exhaust gas partial quantity, but alternatively may also be implemented as a connection<br>
which may be switched as needed for passage using 2 switching andlor throttle valve or<br>
may also be regulated in regard to the flow quantity.<br>
Ai the output, the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber 12 of the ammonia reactor 11 is connected<br>
via at least one channel 20 to an exhaust gas line 10, 102 connected to the turbine<br>
outlet 8. Via this channel or these channels 20, the ammonia produced in the ammonia reactor<br>
11 or the gas mjxture containing this ammonia is transferable into the exhaust gas system<br>
10, 10a.<br>
In the exemplary embodimen: shown in Figure 2, a section 10 a of the exhaust gas line 1C<br>
adjoins the outlet 8 of t h t~urb ine housins 5 in which - still close to the exhaust gas turbocharger<br>
1 - an oxidation catalyst 21 used for NO - NO? conversion is installed.<br>
This exhaust gas line section 10a having the installed oxidation catalyst 21 is enclosed externally<br>
at a distance by a pipe 22, which also is connected to the outlet 8 of the turbine<br>
housing 5, its front face 23 there. The at least one channel, here multiple channels 20; dlscharge<br>
into this annular channei 24 thus resulting. In this case, the ammonia produced in the<br>
ammonia reactor i 1 or the gas mixture containing it is accordingly fed into the annular channel<br>
24, which then conducts it as a parallel flow past the oxidation catalyst 21 and feeds its<br>
flow into the exhaust gas flow after the latter and then from there - mixed with the exhaust<br>
gas enriched with NO2 - jeeds it to the SCR catalyst(s). The channels 20 are implemented as<br>
holes which lead from the outer front face 23 of the turbine outlet 8 through the turbine housing<br>
wall section enclosing the turbine outlet 8 into the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber 12.<br>
The cross-section of the channel 20 or the entire cross-section of all channels 20 is dimensioned<br>
in accordance with the conversion speed of the starting material used for ammonia<br>
production - urea-water solution or solid urea - in such way that this conversion process into<br>
ammonia may occur completely and witho~r~ets idile.<br>
The wall delimiting the vaporization/hydrolysis chamber 12 may be provided internally with a<br>
catalytic coating favoring the conversion of the urea, e.g., titanium dioxide (Ti02).<br>
In addition, in the case of the examples shown in Figures 1 through 3, the outside of the iurbine<br>
housing outer wall 6 may have ribs or other projecting structures - for the purpose of<br>
increasing the heat-radiating area and thus the heat introduced into the vaporizationlhydrolysis<br>
chamber 12.<br>
To attach a nozzle used for feeding the urea-water solution or the end piece 25 of a pipe for<br>
injecting solid urea prills (see Figure 4), a support 26 (see Figure 5) may be provided, which<br>
is screwed into an attachment eye 27 provided externally on the ammonia reactor 11 and<br>
accommodates the nozzle or the end piece 25 of the pipe 16 forming the injection channel.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the support 26 may have a plate 28 on its reactor-interior end. This<br>
plate 28, which is flushed on all sides by the hoi exhaust gas, may form the first conversion<br>
element for incident urea-water jets as a heating plate. In the case of solid urea, the plate 28<br>
rnay be used as an impact plate, on which the injected urea prills may be smashed into multiple<br>
extremely small particles as they hit it, which favor the conversion process into ammonia.<br>
Using the ammonia reactor according to the p:resent invention situated around the turbine<br>
housing, ii is possible to dispense with costly and bulky hydrolysis reactors. The ammonia<br>
reactor itself only occupies a small amount of space, which is normally present in any case<br>
around the turbine of an exhaust gas turbocharger or remains free. In addition, the ammonia<br>
reactor according to the present invention may be implemented less expensively than a hydrolysis<br>
reactor in the final effect,</td>
