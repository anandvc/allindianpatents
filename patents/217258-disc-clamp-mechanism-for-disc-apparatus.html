				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the,Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a disc drive such as a CD player, and more particularly to a disc clamp mechanism capable of thinning a disc drive.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
An example of a conventional disc clamp mechanism for a CD player is shown in Figs. 8A to lOB. as shown in Figs. 8A and 8B, a disc motor 3 is fixedly mounted on a main chassis (not shown), and a turntable 4 is fixedly connected to a rotary shaft of the disc motor 3. A clamper holder 2 fixed to a clamper holding chassis 1 holds a clamper 8 over the turntable 4 when a disc 7 is undamped, as shoun in Fig. 8B.<br>
A lift mechanism for the clamper holding chassis 1 is shown in Fig. 9 and Figs. lOA and lOB.  Shafts la, la,... mounted upright on side walls of the clamper holding chassis 1 are inserted into cam grooves Sa, 5a,... of sliders 5 and 6.<br>
The sliders 5 and 6 are driven back and forth relative to the main chassis by an unrepresented drive<br><br>
mechanism. As the sliders 5 and 6 move, the clamper holding chassis 1 is raised or lowered. The shafts la, la,... are also inserted into vertical grooves (not shown) of the main chassis.<br>
In the disc unclamp state shown in Fig. SB, the clamper holding chassis 1 is at a raised position. The disc 7 is transported by an unrepresented transport mechanism to a position over the turntable 4 via a space between the turntable 4 and clamper 8. Thereafter, as the clamper holding chassis 1 is lowered, the clamper holder 2 places the clamper 8 on the turntable 4 and becomes spaced from the clamper 8.<br>
The clamper 8 is then attracted by a magnetic force of the turntable 4 to squeeze the disc 7 between the clamper 8 and turntable 4. This state is a clamp state of the disc 7 as shown in Fig. 8A. The clamped disc 7 is rotated by the disc motor 3, and an unrepresented optical pickup element is fed along a disc radial direction to reproduce data recorded in the disc 7.<br>
Unclamping the disc 7 is conducted by raising the clamper holding chassis 1 from the position shown in Fig. 8R. The clamper holder 2 is made of a thin plate in order to prevent a contact with the disc 7 clamper 8 while the disc 7 is clamped.<br>
In the conventional disc clamp mechanism described above, the clamper 8 greatly lowers toward the turntable 4 from the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis<br><br>
1 in the disc unclamp state. It is therefore difficult to provide a large space between the clamper 8 and turntable 4. From this reason, the disc 7 may contact the clamper 8 or turntable 4 while it is transported, and the disc 7 may be damaged.<br>
If a lift stroke of the clanger holding chassis 1 is made large, a large space can be formed between the clamper 8 and turntable 4. However in this case, a height of the apparatus becomes large.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Invention has been, made In view of the above problems. It is an object of the present invention to provide a disc clamp mechanism for a disc apparatus capable of providing a large space between a clamper and a turntable in a disc unclamp state even if the apparatus is made compact.<br>
Recording to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a disc clamp mechanism for a disc apparatus wherein a disc is clamped or undamped by moving a clamper holding chassis near to or remote from a turntable, the clamper holding chassis holding a clamper with a clamper holder, and a contact portion of the clamper holder with the clamper is deformed relative to the clamper holding chassis along a motion direction of the clamper holding chassis.<br>
In the disc clamp mechanism for a disc apparatus.<br><br>
the clamper holder may be made of a plate spring.<br>
In the disc clamp mechanism for a disc apparatus, the bottom surface of the clamper may be made flush with or higher than a plane extending from the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis in an unclamp state.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A disc clamp mechanism for a CD player according to embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. With reference to Figs. lA and IB, the operation principle of a disc clamp mechanism for a CD player according to 3 first embodiment of the Invention will be described. In Figs. lA and IB, elements having similar functions to those of a conventional mechanism are represented by using identical reference niimerals, and the detailed description thereof is omitted.<br>
In the first embodiment, a clamper holder 2 is made of a plate spring. A contact portion of the clamper holder 2 with a clamper 8 is deformed upward in a disc unclamp state. In this state, the bottom surface of the clamper 8 held by the clamper holder 2 is raised higher than the bottom surface of a clamper holding chassis 1. Fig. IB shows a clamp state of a disc 7.<br>
With reference to Figs. 2 to 5, the way the clamper holder 2 Is deformed will be described.  Fig. 3E shows<br><br>
the shape of the clamper holder 2. The clamper holder 2 has a projection 2a at Its distal end portion. In a natural state not applied with a force, the clamper holder 2 is bent two steps so that the surface of the projection 2a is lower than its base end portion.<br>
The base end portion of the clamper holder 2 is fixed to a lever 9 shown in Fig. 2. The lever 9 is rotatively fitted in the clamper holding chassis 1 and is rotated by a slider 5 as shown In. Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
More specifically, a shaft 5b mounted upright on the slider 5 is Inserted in a vertical groove (not visible in Figs. 4 and 5) formed In a bent portion of the lever 9. As shown In Fig. 4, as the slider 5 makes the clamper holding chassis 1 rise, the lever 9 is rotated in the clockwise direction as viewed from a higher position, whereas as shown in Fig. 5, as the slider 5 makes the cLamper holding chassis 1 lower, the lever 9 is rotated In the counter-clockwise direction as viewed from a higher position.<br>
While the lever 9 is rotated as the clamper holding chassis 1 is raised or lowered, a relative motion of the lever 9 and clamper holding chassis 1 deforms the projection 2a of the clamper holder 2 fixed to the lever 9.<br>
Figs. 3A to 3D shows a deformation of the projection 2a of the clamper holder 2. Figs. 3A to 30 are drawn assuming that a weight of the clamper 8 is not<br><br>
applied to the clamper holder 2. The clamper holding chassis 1 is raised in the sequential order of Figs. 3A to 3D. As shown, the projection 2a of the clamper holder 2 deforms along the motion direction of the clamper holding chassis 1.<br>
Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 1B, the bottom surface of the clamper 8 becomes higher than the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis 1 in the unclamp state of a disc 7. It is therefore possible to form a large space between the clamper 8 and a turntable 4 and prevent the disc 7 from contacting the clamper 8 or turntable 4 and being damaged while the disc 7 is transported. Furthermore, a stroke of the clamper holding chassis 1 necessary for reserving the space becomes small so that the disc apparatus can be made compact.<br>
Figs. 6A and 6B show a second embodiment of the invention. Similar to the first embodiment, the lever 9 is fitted In the clamper holding chassis 1 and rotated as the clamper holding chassis 1 is raised or lowered. The clamper holder 2 made of a plate spring is fixed to the clamper holding chassis 1. In a natural state not applied with a force, a contact portion of the clamper holder 2 with the clamper 8 is positioned higher than the base portion of the clamper 8.<br>
Fig. 6A shows an unclamp state, and Fig. 6B shows a clamp state.   Also with the configuration of the<br><br>
second embodiment, the bottom surface of the clamper 8 can be set higher than the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis 1 In the unclamp state of a disc.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a third embodiment of the Invention. Similar to the first embodiment, the lever 9 is fitted in the clamper holding chassis 1 and rotated as the clamper holding chassis 1 is raised or lowered. The lever 9 is formed with three slanted surfaces 9b. A clamper holder 10 is of a ring shape with three projections 10a.<br>
The projections 10a of the clamper holder 10 are inserted into grooves lb formed in the clamper holding chassis 1 and ride on the slanted surfaces 9b of the lever 9. Also with the configuration of the third embodiment, the bottom surface of the clamper 8 can be set higher than the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis 1 in the unclamp state of a disc.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above embodiments. For example, instead of deforming the clamper holder by the slider for raising or lowering the clamper holding chassis, it may be deformed by a drive mechanism with another motor dedicated to this mechanism.<br>
According to the disc clamp mechanism for a disc apparatus of this invention, the bottom surface of the clamper can be made higher than the bottom surface of the clamper holding chassis in the disc unclamp state.<br><br>
It is therefore possible to form a large space between the clamper and turntable to prevent the disc from becoming in contact with the clamper or turntable and being damaged while the disc Is transported.<br>
Furthermore, since a stroke of the clamper holding chassis necessary for reserving the space can be made small, the disc apparatus can be made compact.<br><br><br>
