(Figure Remove) <br>

R4, R5, R6, R7 are independently hydrogen or CrC6 alkyl; and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, that are active as sodium and/or calcium channel modulators and therefore useful in preventing, alleviating and curing a wide range of pathologies, including, but not limited to, neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, inflammatory, ophthalmic, urologic, metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases, where the above mechanisms have been described as playing a pathological role.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Chemical background<br>
DE 2624290 describes 2-aminocycloalkanecarboxylic acids and their derivatives with the general formula<br><br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br>
wherein R1 is a hydroxyl or a NR4R5 group, R2 and R3 are hydrogen, alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or acyl, R4 and R5 are hydrogen, CrC8 alkyl, aralkyl, aryl or heteroaryl, and their use as analgesics, antipyretics, and anesthetics.<br>
Biological background<br>
It is well known that sodium channels play an important role in the neuronal network by transmitting electrical impulses rapidly throughout cells and cell networks, thereby coordinating higher processes ranging from locomotion to cognition. These channels are large transmembrane proteins, which are able to switch between different states to enable selective permeability for sodium ions. For this process an action potential is needed to depolarize the membrane, and hence these channels are voltage-gated. In the past few years a much better understanding of sodium channels and drugs interacting with them has been developed.<br>
It has become clear that a number of drugs having an unknown mechanism of action actually act by modulating sodium channel conductance, including local anesthetics, class I antiarrhythmics and anticonvulsants. Neuronal sodium channel blockers have found application with their use in the treatment of epilepsy (phenytoin and carbamazepine), bipolar disorder (lamotrigine), preventing neurodegeneration, and in reducing neuropathic pain. Various anti- epileptic drugs that stabilize neuronal excitability are<br>
effective in neuropathic pain (gabapentin).<br>
In addition, an increase in sodium channel expression or activity has also been observed in several models of inflammatory pain, suggesting a role of sodium channels in inflammatory pain.<br>
Calcium channels are membrane-spanning, multi-suburiit proteins that allow controlled entry of calcium ions into cells from the extracellular fluid. Commonly, calcium channels are voltage dependent and are referred to as voltage sensitive calcium channels (VSCC). VSCCs are found throughout the mammalian nervous system, where they regulate such varied activities as cellular excitability, transmitter release, intracellular metabolism, neurosecretory activity and gene expression. All "excitable" cells in animals, such as neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerve cells, and muscle cells, including those of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles and venous and arterial smooth muscles, have voltage dependent calcium channels. Calcium channels have a central role in regulating intracellular calcium ions levels that are important for cell viability and function. Intracellular calcium ion concentrations are implicated in a number of vital processes in animals, such as neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, pacemaker activity, and secretion of hormones. It is believed that calcium channels are relevant in certain disease states. A number of compounds useful in treating various cardiovascular diseases in mammals, including humans, are thought to exert their beneficial effects by modulating functions of voltage dependant calcium channels present in cardiac and/or vascular smooth muscle. Compounds with activity against calcium channels have also been implicated for the treatment of pain. In particular N-type calcium channels (Cav2.2), responsible for the regulation of neurotransmitters, are thought to play a significant role in nociceptive transmission, both due to their tissue distribution as well as from the results of several pharmacological studies.<br>
This hypothesis has been validated in the clinic by Zinocotide, a peptide derived from the venom of the marine snail, Conus Magus. A limitation in the therapeutic use of this peptide is that it has to be administered intrathecally in humans (Bowersox S. S. and Luther R. Toxicon, 1998, 36, 11, 1651-1658).<br>
All together these findings indicate that compounds with sodium and/or calcium channel blockade have a high therapeutic potential in preventing, alleviating and curing a wide range of pathologies, including neurological, psychiatric, cardiovascular, urologic, metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases, where the above mechanisms have been described as playing a pathological role.<br>
There are many papers and patents which describe sodium channel and/or calcium channel modulators or antagonists for the treatment or modulation of a plethora of disorders, such as their use as local anesthetics, antiarrhythmics, antiemetics, antimanic depressants, agents for the treatment of unipolar depression, cardiovascular diseases, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, inflammation, epilepsy, neurodegenerative conditions, nerve cell death, anticonvulsants, neuropathic pain, migraine, acute hyperalgesia and inflammation, renal disease, allergy, asthma, bronchospasm, dysmenorrhea, esophageal spasm, glaucoma, urinary tract disorders, gastrointestinal motility disorders, premature labour, obesity. A largely incomplete list is shown below.<br>

PHARMACOLOGY<br>
The compounds of the invention display affinities for the calcium and/or sodium channel binding sites as demonstrated using selective radioligands in in vitro binding studies.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are blockers of the voltage dependent sodium channels and/or calcium channels. These compounds therefore displace 3H-batrachotoxin (BTX) with a high affinity from the binding site on the sodium channel, with ICsp in the low |oM or sub uM range. Similarly the compounds displace 3H-nitrendipine from the binding site in the calcium channel, with ICso in the low uM or most usually in the sub uM range as well as inhibiting calcium influx induced through calcium channels via cellular depolarisation.<br>
Such substances exhibit "use-dependency" when the sodium channels are blocked i.e. maximum blockage of the sodium channels is only achieved after repeated stimulation of the sodium channel. Consequently, the substances preferably bind to sodium channels which are multiply activated. As a result the substances are capable of activity preferentially in those regions of the body which are pathologically over-stimulated, as illustrated by patch-clamp experiments (W.A. Catteral, Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 8, 57-65; 1987) which show that the compounds according to the invention block the electrically stimulated sodium channel in a "use-dependent" manner.<br>
As a consequence of these mechanisms the compounds of the invention are active in vivo when orally administered in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/kg in a wide range of animal models and in particular in the MES test of electrically-induced convulsions, in the formalin model of persistent pain and in the carragenan model of inflammation.<br>
The voltage dependent block of the calcium and/or sodium channels of the compounds of the invention has been shown by fluorescence calcium influx assay and electrophysiological studies.<br>
The N-type calcium channel modulating activity of the cyclopentyl derivatives of general formula I was measured through a fluorescence based calcium influx assay.<br>
The sodium channel modulating activity of the cyclopentyl derivatives of general formula I was measured through electrophysiological assays using the two electrodes voltage clamp (TEVC) technique in isolated Xenopus oocytes expressing the Na channel Nav 1.3.<br>

Example 7<br>
Calcium influx assay<br>
IMR32 human neuroblastoma cells constitutively possess both L and N type channels. Under differentiating conditions, IMR32 preferentially express<br>
on the membrane surface N- type calcium channels. The remaining L-type calcium channels were blocked using the selective L type blocker, nifedipine. In these experimental conditions, only N type channels can be detected.<br>
IMR32 cells were differentiated using 1 mM dibutyrril-cAMP and 2.5 uM bromodeoxyuridine for 8 days (4 times) in 225 cm2 flask, then detached, seeded at 200,000 cells/well on 96 polilysine-coated plates and further incubated for 18-24 h in the presence of differentiating buffer before use.<br>
The Ca2"1 Kit Assay (Molecular Devices), based on a fluorescent calcium indicator 485-535 nm wawelength, was used.<br>
Differentiated cells were incubated with dye loading for 30 min at 37°C then, nifedipine alone (1 uM) or in the presence of oo-conotoxin or test compounds were added for further 15 min.<br>
The fluorescence (485-535nm) was measured before and after (30-40 sec) the automated injection of 100 mM KC1 depolarizing solution using a Victor plate reader (Perkin Elmer).<br>
The inhibition curves were calculated from 5 concentrations, each in triplicate, and the ICso determined using a linear regression analysis.<br>
Preferred compounds of general formula 1 inhibit N-type calcium channels with an ICso value less than 10 (J.M.<br>
Example 8<br>
Electrophysiological assay<br>
Experiments for the determination of the tonic block are carried out on isolated Xenopus oocytes expressing the Na channel Nav 1.3. Currents are recorded using the two electrodes voltage clamp (TEVC) technique<br>
Oocytes preparation:<br>
The frog (Xenopus Laevis) is anesthesized in a solution with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (1 g/1) and, after 25 minutes, it is placed on its back on an "iced-bed". The skin and the others tissues are cut, the ovarian<br><br>
lobes are pulled out and kept in ND960Ca2+ (NaCI 96 mM, KC1 2 mM, MgC12 1 mM, Hepes 10 mM, pH 7.85 withNaOH).<br>
After the removal of the oocytes, the muscle and the skin are sutured separately.<br>
Ovarian lobes are reduced into clusters of 10/20 oocytes, put in tubes with collagenase solution (1 mg/ml) and kept in movement for about 1 h in an incubator.<br>
At the end of this step, when the oocytes are well separated ones from the others, they are rinsed three times with ND960Ca2+and three times with NDE (ND960Ca2+ + CaCl 0.9 mM, MgC12 0.9 mM, piruvate 2.5 mM, gentamicine 50 mg/1).<br>
The oocytes obtained are at different stages of development. Only cells at stages V or VI are selected for RNA injection subsequent experiments.<br>
The day after the preparation, the oocytes are injected (Drummond Nanoject) with 20 ng Navl.3 cRNA and maintained in NDE.<br>
Starting from 48h after the mRNA injection whole cell currents are recorded using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp automated workstation.<br>
Typical Microelectrodes have a resistance of 0.5 to 1 Mohm and are filled with KC1 3M.<br>
Control bath solution containes (mM): NaCI 98, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5 (pH 7.6).<br>
Compounds are prepared in stock solutions (20 mM) and dissolved to the final concentrations in the external bath solution.<br>
Currents recording:<br>
The current/voltage (I/V) relationship for the Navl.3 currents expressed in oocytes was first studied in order to determine the membrane potential evoking the maximal activation. Navl.3 showed the max activation at 0 mV, that we used as test potential (Vtest) for tonic block studies.<br>
The steady - state inactivation properties of the Navl.3 currents were than studied in order to determine the membrane potentials for the resting state (Vrest) at which channel availabity is maximal (Imax), and the membrane potential for the half maximal inactivation (V '/2) producing half of the max current availability (I V-z) respectively. This two voltage conditions were then used for the evaluation of the voltage dependence of the tonic block.<br>
Finally a two-step protocol was used to determine the voltage dependence of the block of Navl.3: the oocytes were clamped at -80 mV, the currents were activated by a 100 ms step pulse to 0 mV (Vtest) from a 3000 ms preconditioning potential at -80 mV (resting, Imax condition) and -40 mV (depolarized, I '/a condition), respectively.<br>
Current amplitudes in,the two conditions were recorded in the absence and in the presence of different concentrations of compound (washout was made in between) in oder to determine the concentration - inhibition curves and ICso values for the tonic block in the depolarized (half max current availability) conditions.<br>
Preferred compounds of general formula I inhibit Nav 1.3 sodium channels with an ICso value lower than the reference sodium channel blocker ralfinamide.<br>
Example 9<br>
Maximal electroshock test in rats and mice<br>
Wistar rats received an electroshock (160 mA for 0.2 s with a pulse train of 60 Hz having a pulse duration of 0.4 ms; ECTunit model 7801, Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) through intra-aural clip electrodes sufficient to produce a hindlimb tonic extensor response in at least 97% of control animals.<br>
Mice received a 28 mA shock of 0.7 s with a pulse train of 80 Hz having a pulse duration of 0.4 ms. Several doses of the test compound and standard<br>
AEDs were administered to groups of 10 to 20 mice or rats per dose in a volume of 5 ml/kg 60 min p.o. or 30 min i.p. before induction of MES to calculate ED50 values. The complete suppression of the hindlimb tonic extensor component of seizures was taken as evidence of anticonvulsant activity.<br>
Example 10<br>
Mice Formalin Test<br>
According to a modified protocol from Rosland et al., (1990) mice were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 20 ul of 2.7% solution of formalin into the plantar surface of left hindpaw and placed immediately into clear PVC observation chambers (23 x 12 x 13 cm). Pain behaviour was quantified by counting the cumulative licking time (s) of the injected paw. Measurements were taken during the early phase (0-5 min) and late phase (30-40 min) after formalin injection (Tjolsen et al. 1992).<br>
The test compound was administered p.o. 15 min before formalin injection in a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight to groups of 10 mice per dose. Control group was treated with vehicle.<br>
Example 11<br>
Carragenan model of inflammation<br>
Male Wistar rats of 175-200 grams were used.<br>
The left hind paw was injected with 100 ul of carrageenan (2% w/v in saline). Compounds of the invention (30 mg/kg), indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or control vehicle (such as distilled water) were orally administered 1 h before carrageenan injection. The paw volume was measured with a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile) immediately before (basal) and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h after the carrageenan injection.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
