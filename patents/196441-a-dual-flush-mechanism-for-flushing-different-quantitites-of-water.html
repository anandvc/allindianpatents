				<td>A DUAL FLUSHING MECHANISM<br>
The present invention relates to a system for dual flushing mechanism in a toilet.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The total population has increased and the consumption of water has also increased accordingly. It is the duty and responsibility of each one of us to save water. Otherwise, there is a possibility of calamity. Major factors that lead us to invent this product are increasing population and the limited supply of water. The significant source of water consumption is in flushing toilets.<br>
Most of the toilets, flushing systems are designed in such a way that the outflow of water is maximum resulting in wastage of water. Many industrial giants entered in the field of DUAL FLUSHING SYSTEM, the art has then developed toilets that use less water during certain flush cycles. But these devices are much complicated, hard to operate and expensive. These devices are of very poor actuating system due to lack of proper leverage, component wareout in between moving parts and also due to scaling in water. Hence, as a result, continuous attention and frequent maintenance is required on such devices.<br>
OBJECT AND THE SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of this invention is to provide a dual flush mechanism for flushing different quantity of water in the toilets according to needs.<br>
To achieve the said objective this invention provides a system for dual flush mechanism for flushing different quantities of water comprises:<br>
a cistern having two links    connected to two separate co-axial<br>
central tube,<br>
each of the said center tube is having separate float around the said<br>
center tubes in separate houses,<br>
the inner center tube is connected to a outflow valve and the outer<br>
center tube is connected to actuator,<br><br>
each of said link is connected to pusher rod for pushing the link downwards for releasing different quantity of water,<br>
the arrangement being such that:<br>
when link connected to the inner center tube is pushed from the pusher rod downwards, the inner center tube moves upward without disturbing outer tube, thereby opening the outflow' valve and allowing the full quantity of water to flush the commode and as water level in the system decreases, the float on the inner tube comes down, thereby closing the outlet;<br>
when link connected to the outer center tube is pushed from the pusher rod downwards, both the inner and outer center tube move upward along with float and actuator, thereby opening the outflow valve and allow reduced quantity of water to flush the commode as the water level decreases the actuator will get released from its rest position and the float will move downwards under the dead weight of water and bring both the tubes down thereby closing the outlet with the said valve.<br>
The said two links connected to two separate co-axial center tubes are provided on the top of the flush mechanism with a bracket means.<br>
The said outflow valve is provided on the valve seat at the bottom of flush mechanism.<br>
The said floats around inner and the outer center tubes have different shapes and sizes depending on the shape and size of the housings.<br>
The said dual flush mechanism is made of either plastic or metal.<br>
The   invention    will   now    be    described       with   reference    to accompanying drawings<br>
Figure 1  shows the    the dual flushing mechanism according to this invention.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows the valve seat with the outflow valve.<br>
Figure 3 shows the exploded view of the dual flush mechanism according to this invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to the Figure 1 which shows the dual flush mechanism, the link 1.2 is connected to the said outer center tube (1.3) on which an adjustable float (1.4) is provided. This float (1.4)and actuator (1.5) have a major role to control the flow of water towards outlet.<br>
When the link (1.1) connected to the inner center tube(1.6) is pushed from the pusher rod(3.2)downwards, the inner center tube(1.6) moves upward without disturbing outer center tube (1.3), thereby opening the outflow valve(2.1) and allowing the full quantity of water to flush the commode and as water level in the system decreases, the float(3.6) on the inner center tube(l .6) comes down, thereby closing the outlet;<br>
When link(l .2) connected to the outer center tube(l .3) is pushed from the pusher rod(3.2) downwards, both the inner and outer center tube(1.6)&amp;(1.3) move upward along with float(1.4) and actuator(1.5), thereby opening the outflow valve(2.1) and allow reduced quantity of water to flush the commode. As the water level decreases the actuator(1.5) will get released from its rest position and the float(1.4) will move downwards under the dead weight of water and bring both the tubes down thereby closing the outlet with the said valve(2.1).<br>
The floats provided on the inner and outer centre tubes (1.6)&amp;(1.3) are of different shapes and size.<br>
Figure 2 shows the valve seat with the outflow valve. The outflow valve 2.1 is connected to the inner center tube (1.6) and sits directly on the valve seat(2.2). When the lifting of center tube (1.6) takes place, the outflow valve 2.1 opens and lets the water flow through the outlet.<br>
Figure 3 shows the exploded view of the dual flush mechanism. At the bottom of the cistern, the valve seat 2.2 is fixed. The inner center tube (1.6) will be inserted in the housing (3.7), further it is locked with the valve seat (2.2). The float 50 mm (3.6) is then assembled with the center tube (1.6) and then incorporated in the housing (3.7). Housing (3.5) is placed over the housing (3.7) and locked with the lock hinge.<br><br>
The outer center tube (1.3) with the float 45 mm(1.4) and actuator(1.5) which is assembled in prior is then accommodated in housing (3.5). The link (1.1) and link (1.2) is connected to the center tube (1.6) and center tube (1.3) respectively and further pivoted with housing (3.5) by split pins.<br>
The pushers (3.2) are assembled with the pusher housing with the springs . This assembly will be locked with the housing (3.5) on top.<br>
A holder (3.8) is placed in the provisions provided in the bracket (3.9) is assembled with the total assembly. The bracket (3.9) can be adjusted according to the cistern height. The two links(l.l)&amp;(1.2) are connected to two separate co-axial center tube are provided on the top of the flush mechanism with a bracket.<br>
The holder (3.8) helps the device to align with the holes on top of the lid and at the bottom of the cistern. The lid is then placed on the cistern after accommodating the inlet system. The bush, which is chromium plated with high finish is located in the full proof holder and fastened by M 10 nut. The part and full flush knobs (3.1) which are also chromium plated are fixed with the pusher rod and then inserted in the bush.<br><br><br><br><br>
