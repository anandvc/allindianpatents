				<td>METHODS AND SYSTEM FOR DYNAMIC DATABASE CONTENT PERSISTENCE AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT<br>
[0001] This patent application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application entitled "Method And Architecture For Flexible And Dynamic Database Content Persistence And Information Management," to Ramani Sriram, filed on November 13,2003 and assigned Application No. 60/520,360 (Attorney Docket No. 7281.P001Z), and to the United States Nonprovisional Patent Application entitled "Methods and System For Dynamic Database Content Persistence and Information<br>
Management", application no.	, filed November 12,2004, (Attorney Docket<br>
No. 7281 .P001) hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The field relates to data storage and processing, and, more particularly, to methods and system for dynamic database content persistence and information management.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Traditional persistence mechanisms and information network architectures map information content, structure, and relationships into database tables. Database systems manage formatted collections of shared data.<br>
[0004] A prevalent type of database today is a relational database. A relational database is a collection of data items organized as a set of formally-described tables from which data can be accessed in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables. A relational database stores data in two-dimensional tables. Each table (also referred to as a relation) contains one or more categories of data organized in columns. The names of the columns of the table are referred to as data fields, which are the finest granularity of data units available for users to manipulate. A data field is a basic data type such as name, age, address, etc. A row or record of a table contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns. Each row has one component for each data field of the table. One or more indexes on large tables are<br><br>
generally provided to facilitate data accesses. A typical software application may be made up of a proliferation of tables, rows, columns, and objects, with attributes and relations.<br>
[0005] Although the rows of a table are frequently modified, schema changes, while possible in commercial database systems, are very expensive and inefficient because each one of the perhaps millions of rows may need to be rewritten to add or delete components. If a data field is added, for example, it may be difficult or even impossible to find the correct value for the new component of the rows. When columns are added to, deleted from, or modified within a table, metadata change is necessary. Accordingly, modeling data structures, relationships, and key constraints, designing and creating database tables, maintaining referential integrity, data consistency, and the privilege model, tuning for performance and archiving, operating and maintaining a database is highly complex, cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, the proliferation of tables and foreign key relationships necessitates elaborate and expensive operational tasks for back-ups, archival, error recovery, replication and management.<br>
[0006] Furthermore, typical software applications are often database-dependent, meaning applications are adapted to a particular backend data store or metadata design. However, this rigidity effectively limits the application from operating on different types of data stores absent significant remodel, redesign, and change to application software.<br>
[0007] Generally, external data routing capability is not provided for distributed storage solutions. Partitioning can increase the speed and efficiency of data access. A table can be divided into partitions, with each partition containing a portion of the table's data. A partition containing more frequently used data can be placed on faster data storage devices. However, the data routing capability is restrictive in purpose and scope. In addition, data may not be easily distributed to different data store types or in different data store instances. Thus, designing and creating database tables, maintaining referential integrity, data consistency, and the privilege model, tuning for performance and archiving, and operating and maintaining a database is highly complex, cumbersome and time-consuming.<br><br>
[0008] In the prior art, one Extensible Markup Language (XML) structure is tailored for one type of information. Particularized XML tags are information-specific by corresponding to particular data elements. For example, an XML schema for a purchase order includes particularized tags for purchase order data elements. However, the prior art XML structure and accompanying tags are highly dependent on information type, are not generalized to be information type-independent, and require time and effort to maintain for different types of information. Due to a lack of standardization, transformation from one particularized structure to another is cumbersome to implement<br>
[0009] Templates for particular information are also limited by their rigidity. For example, in the case of relational databases, metadata is embedded in information-specific tables. Accordingly, templates are 
[0010] A data dictionary is generally a table that holds metadata. The typical data dictionary holds information such as a list of all the tables in the database, the structure of the tables, and general database structure. However, a data dictionary fails to enable consistency in semantic, usage, and interpretation of information. [0011] Typical relational database management systems have restrictive transactional capability. A transaction is a unit of work consisting of one or more individual steps and/or operations to be applied to one or more local and/or remote databases as a single unit of work. A characteristic of transactions is the requirement that either all steps and/or operations are applied or all are rolled back in the case of a problem so that the database is always left in a consistent state.<br>
[0012] Transactions involving a single database, typically involve the following operations which are all handled as part of the standard operations of the database management systems (DBMS):<br>
1. Begin: Beginning a transaction creates a transaction scope. From the time the transaction is begun until it is successfully committed or rolled back, operations against<br><br>
the database will be within the scope of the transaction and will either all succeed or all fail.<br>
2.	Commit: Committing a transaction tells the database that all processing has<br>
completed satisfactorily, and that the results should be written to persistent storage.<br>
Before a commit is issued, changes maybe undone by issuing a "rollback" command. If<br>
there is a system crash prior to a commit, on recovery the database will revert to the<br>
   state it was in before the transaction was begun. Executing the commit ends the transaction.<br>
3.	Rollback: Rolling back a transaction revokes any changes that occurred<br>
during the transaction, leaving the database in the state in which it was found prior to<br>
the transaction. After a transaction is committed, it can no longer be rolled back.<br>
[0013] Two-phase commit is a well-known technique to synchronize multiple<br>
resources in transaction processing systems. The two-phase commit protocol has two<br>
phases that are typically referred to as "Prepare" and "Commit." In the Prepare stage,<br>
all resource managers participating in the transaction are told by a transaction manager<br>
to prepare to commit their changes. The databases are instructed to perform all<br>
processing steps short of writing the updates to persistent storage. After each database<br>
completes the "Prepare" phase, it sends a reply to the transaction manager indicating<br>
success (vote commit) or failure (vote rollback). After a database votes commit<br>
(indicating success), it may not initiate a rollback and may only implement a rollback if<br>
instructed to do so by the transaction manager.<br>
[0014] If the Prepare stage has completed satisfactorily (i.e., if all databases voted commit), the transaction manager enters the Commit phase. In this phase, the transaction manager instructs each of the participating databases to commit their changes. After completion, each database reports to the transaction manager that it has completed the transaction. When all databases report completion, the transaction is completed. The two-phase commit protocol is described in more detail in the Open Group Technical standard titled "Distributed TP: The XA Specification," C193, ISBN 1-872630-24-3, February, 1992, and in the Open Group Guide titled "Distributed TP: Reference Model, Version 3," G504, ISBN 1-85912-170-5, February 1996.<br><br>
[0015] The transaction manager collects the replies from all the involved databases. A single vote rollback results in the rollback of the entire transaction. If the transaction manager receives no response from one of the participants, it assumes the operation has failed and rolls back or aborts the transactional unit. The transaction manager rolls back the transaction by sending a rollback instruction to all participating databases. All "dirty stores" are subsequently erased. Accordingly, the prior art is limited in that a data store does not retain all data, including data for which the transaction was rolled back.<br>
[0016] Deadlock is a condition that occurs when two processes are each waiting for the other to complete before proceeding. The result is that both processes hang. Deadlocks occur most commonly in client/server and web-based environments. When a transaction fails to complete in a .finite and usually small amount of time, a deadlock may occur, resulting in performance degradation. Thus, the prior art cannot support long-standing transactions.<br>
[0017] Moreover, a transaction exists only in the context of a user session. Therefore, a transactional unit cannot be shared across collaborating individuals or processes. Additionally, transaction management is typically only available for information stored in a relational database.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0030] In the following description, numerous details are set forth. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form, rather than in detail, in order to avoid obscuring the present invention.<br>
[0031] Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment9' or "an embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. [0032] Figure 1 is a high-level block diagram illustrating the relationship between one embodiment of an information management system and existing systems. [0033] The information management system 120 may reside between an application 110 and a backend data store 130. In another embodiment, the information management system 120 resides between multiple applications and multiple data stores. In yet another embodiment, the information management system 120 resides in an application 110 or data store 130.<br>
[0034] In one embodiment, a data store may include a relational database, object oriented database, text file, ASCII file, or the like, including, for example, Oracle, Sybase, DB2, SQL Server, Veritas File System, or the like. <br>
[0035] Figure 2 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for receiving information. The process is performed by a processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. <br>
[0036] In one embodiment, the application interacts with the application program interfaces (API) of the information management system. In processing block 210, the information management system receives stylized information and operation information. In one embodiment, the stylized information is aligned to a generic information cell structure and is composed in a generic XML structure. Alternatively,<br><br>
the stylized information is composed in a generic Object structure. In one embodiment, the operations may include add, change, delete and fetch operations. In another embodiment, the operation information is embedded in the generic XML structure. In yet another embodiment, the information management system provides for generic processing of information without a priori knowledge of semantic meaning, structure, or intra and inter-information relationships.<br>
[0037] Referring to the block diagram of Figure 6, one embodiment of a generic information cell structure is illustrated. The information is stripped of its semantic meaning with the use of the information cell structure.<br>
[0038] Multiple and diverse types of information may be represented by the generic information cell structure. For example, the information may include a business transaction, such as a purchase order, business information such as parts master data, a complex document with sections, chapters, sub chapter, paragraph groups, paragraphs, and the like. The information may include the content of e-mail, movies, pictures, music, drawings, software applications, or any other information type. <br>
[0039] At the highest level in the cell structure, an information vacuole is a construct that represents an instance of information. The stylized information may also be structured into one or more data elements and/or dimensions of cells. Examples of a data element may include a dimension name, data element name, creation date time stamp, a deletion date time stamp, an information owner unique identification (UID), status, operation, cell creation date time stamp, cell deletion data time stamp, state, ceil, UID, type, version number, session user, session service, qualifiers, such as qualifier    . language, qualifier unit of measurement (UOM), qualifier currency, and qualifier date  . format, transaction handle, transaction is first in, transaction start date time, sequence number, and the like.<br>
[0040] In one embodiment, data elements in the information correspond to the atoms of the cell. In one embodiment, an atom defines a unique set of behavior associated with a fundamental element of data and information management processes in the information management system. In one embodiment, an atom encapsulates the information element at the smallest level of granularity. In one embodiment, an atom may correspond to a column or data field in a database table. Atoms have common characteristics and information management processing logic. For example, atom type<br><br>
descriptors may include an Entity atom, Amount atom, Text atom, Quantity atom, Rate atom, Date atom, File atom, Audio atom, Video atom, and the like. <br>
[0041] In one embodiment, an Entity atom may represent data elements for which an identity has been pre-described. An Amount atom may include a process to perform consistency checks of received values to ensure the received values are numbers. In another embodiment, an Amount atom includes a process to translate currency. Text . atoms, may have a language implication. Text atoms managed by the information management system may have equivalent values in other languages. Quantity and Rate atoms have a unit of measure implication and associated UOM translation processing. In one embodiment, a Date atom includes a process to perform consistency checks to ensure valid date values are received. A Date atom may also include a process to toggle between date formats in a received form and a stored form. In another embodiment, a Date atom further includes processes to calculate a number of days, or a number of business days, between a first date and a target date, as well as other date-related processing. In one embodiment, a File atom includes a process to fetch a filename and path.<br>
[0042] The stylized information may be further refined into multiple dimensions. In one embodiment, a dimension may distinguish data from metadata. For example, one dimension may represent content and another dimension may represent structure of the stylized information vacuole. Content information may include an information payload, such as a purchase order information, part information, a document, etc. [0043] Structure information may include information characteristics, templates, information descriptors, cell descriptors, information key, cell key, content type, encryption rules, transactionality steps, access control restrictions, error conditions, exceptions, storage location identification for the information, and the like. In another embodiment, a dimension distinguishes between multiple types of metadata. <br>
[0044] Metadata, such as data defining structure, may be previously defined using a toolset. Alternatively, the structure information represented by one or more dimensions is received by the information management system with each information instance, payload, or content. In one embodiment, a dimension is further defined by elements and/or one or more cells.<br><br>
[0045] A cell may be comprised of Cell UID, and order information, such as Cell Sequence number, and the like. In one embodiment, a Cell UID uniquely identifies the cell in the context of the information vacuole instance to which it belongs. Each cell in a dimension has a Cell Sequence number and Parent Cell UID that provides the information with a location-based identity. In one embodiment, the location-based identity specifies where the cell and corresponding information occur within a parent cell or information structure. A cell may further be defined by other cells, data vacuoles, and value vacuoles. In one embodiment, a cell is composed of cells within the cell.<br>
[0046] The data vacuole is a structure that identifies a data element. La another embodiment, the data vacuole includes a data element name and one or more values for the data element. A data vacuole may also include a sequence number to identify its location within the parent cell structure. In another embodiment, a data vacuole includes other structural and positional identification. In one example, information which may be represented by a data vacuole may include a purchase order number, a part number, a paragraph of a document, a frame of a video, and the like. In one embodiment, data vacuole elements include a data element name, data element sequence number, and the like. The data vacuole may be further composed of other data vacuoles, value vacuoles, or cells. Data vacuoles inside of a data vacuole provide a capability of having a hierarchical structure associate with information. In one embodiment, data storage management occurs at a data vacuole level. <br>
[0047] A value vacuole sets the value of a data element. In another embodiment, the value vacuole permits a data element to hold multiple values. Accordingly, a value vacuole may also specify a sequence number. The value vacuole may also be a qualifier. There are different qualifiers for different types of data elements. For rates or monetary amounts, the qualifier is currency. For quantity, the qualifier is a unit of measure. For text, the qualifier is language. For date, the qualifier is the date format. A value vacuole may be defined by value vacuole elements, such as a value, value sequence number, value qualifier, and the like.<br>
[0048] In another embodiment, a value vacuole sets the value of a parameter, qualification, or identification for a construct in the cell structure. In one embodiment, a value vacuole under this construct is composed within a cell vacuole. In one<br><br>
embodiment, a value vacuole that is not a part of a name-value pairing may not be<br>
persisted.		<br>
[0049] Referring to the block diagram of Figure 7, one embodiment of a generic XML structure is illustrated. The generic XML schema includes a set of generic tags, which may be used for any information, including information structure, document structure, software system structure, and the like. Reference to the XML generic tags, as used . herein, may include tags and/or attributes. In one embodiment, the XML tags and/or attributes do not carry any information-specific meaning. Rather, the information-specific elements, the name-value pairing of the element, are values within the tags and/or attributes in the XML.<br>
[0050] Informational content may range from simple to complex information types, including business content (e.g., Purchase Order, Invoice, Employee Expense Report, Parts Master information, Inventory, Bill of Material’ Production Master Plan, etc.), a newspaper in electronic format, a novel or a book in electronic format, a document, a movie in digital format, music in electronic format, photographs in electronic format, or other forms of information.<br>
[0051] In one embodiment, the generic tags and/or attributes carry pre-defined structural and positional attributes. In one embodiment, the generic tags and/or attributes mirror the generic information cell structure described in Figure 6. In one embodiment, generic structural tags and/or attributes identify, characterize, or describe in a non-information-specific manner, dimensions, cells, data vacuoles, value vacuoles, version number, information owner, information type, information UK), cell UID, cell sequence number, data element name, data element sequence number, data element value, value vacuole sequence number, state descriptions, and the like. <br>
[0052] In another embodiment; the stylized information is composed in a generic Object structure. In one embodiment, the generic Object structure includes operation information including the operation name and user-defined parameters for the operation.<br>
[0053] In one embodiment, a toolset receives information in a format and returns data in the same format. For example, the toolset may receive information in any structure, such as an input stream, a string buffer, or the like. Moreover, information may be received from any text fie, flat file, comma-delimited file, such as comma-separated<br><br>
values (CSV) file, relational database that implements Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) mode for data manipulation, any other type of data storage which is accessible via JDBC or which exposes published APIs for data manipulation, or the like. The toolset may translate the information into the generic XML structure or the generic Object structure.<br>
[0054] In one embodiment, the toolset is external to the information management system 120. In an alternative embodiment, the toolset, in part or in whole, is bundled with the application 110. In yet another embodiment, the toolset, in part or in whole, is bundled with the data store 130.<br>
[0055] Referring back to Figure 2, in processing block 220, the system decomposes the stylized information into one or more atom groups. In processing block 230, a manipulation statement, which is native to the data store, is formed. In processing block 240, the native data manipulation statement is transmitted to the data store. In another embodiment, the system establishes a connection to the data store and invokes the data management operation in the data store. In one embodiment, information is stored in a database as a single table.<br>
[0056] Figure 3 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for the decomposition in one embodiment. The process is performed by a processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. The processes of Fig. 3 are in reference to processing block 220 of Figure 2. [0057] The decomposition process begins, in one embodiment, at processing block 310, where the information management system generates structural and positional identification for the received information. The identification allows the information management system to maintain the exact structure and positional integrity of the information. In one embodiment, the identification identifies one or more individual cell structure, the position and location in which the cell structures occur, and their positional relationship to other cell structures. In one embodiment, a cell structure includes an information vacuole, a dimension, a cell, a data vacuole, or a value vacuole. [0058] In one embodiment, the structural and positional identification includes one or more of an information UID, and a version number. The information management system may generate an information UID, which uniquely identifies the instance of the<br><br>
information. The system may assign a version number to identify a version number of an information instance. In another embodiment, structural and positional identification includes an Info Type, which identifies the type of the information, and Info Owner, which identifies the owner of the information.<br>
[0059] In another embodiment, the structural and positional identification includes one<br>
or more of a cell UID, cell sequence number, and parent cell structure UID. The<br>
information management system may generate a cell UID to uniquely identify the cell<br>
in the context of the information. The system may assign a cell sequence number to<br>
identify the position of the cell in the parent cell structure. The system may also .<br>
identify the parent cell structure UID.	.<br>
[0060] In one embodiment, structural and positional identification also refers to any other structure of the information cell structure. Accordingly, the Cell UID, Cell Seq Num, and cell unique identification may be generated for any dimension, cell, data vacuole, or value vacuole.<br>
[0061] In processing blocks 320 and 330, the information management system associates metadata with the information. As previously discussed, metadata, such as data defining structure, may be previously defined. In one embodiment, the data defining structure is defined in a data definition repository or a data thesaurus. Alternatively, structural information, such as characteristics or templates, maybe received with the information instance, payload, or content.<br>
[0062] Referring to the block diagram of Figure 8, one embodiment of a data thesaurus is illustrated. In one embodiment, the data thesaurus maintains descriptions of   , information elements, which are the smallest units of information. In one embodiment, the data thesaurus includes an information element name, information element type to describe the function of the element, synonyms, description, label names, usage . information for where the information element is used, help information, characteristics, atom type, and the like. In one embodiment, label names are used to distinguish among purposes for the information element. For example, purposes may include for display on a screen, for reports, for description in a document, and the like. In another embodiment, the data thesaurus provides APIs for localization, in which the information element labels are maintained in a native language of a locality. In one embodiment, the data thesaurus allows public sharing of atoms.<br><br>
[0063] As discussed in relation to Figure 6, metadata, such as data defining structure, may be previously defined using a toolset. Accordingly, atom behavior may be predefined in a Data Thesaurus. For example, Part identification (ID) in a purchase order may be an Entity atom where an instance of the Part ID may be set-up before being used in the purchase order. Furthermore, an Amount atom may be predefined to ensure received values are in a proper format. A Date atom may be predefined to ensure the received values are valid date values. In another embodiment, the Data Thesaurus may include the processes of other predefined atoms.<br>
[0064] Referring back to Figure 3, in processing block 320, the information management system fetches the metadata from the data store or from a dimension in the stylized information. In one embodiment, the characteristics of an information are fetched. Characteristic information may identify atoms and atom parameters for each data vacuole in the stylized information.<br>
[0065] In processing block 330, the stylized information is transposed with the corresponding characteristics information. In one embodiment, the information elements from the information are compared against the data thesaurus to ensure validity.<br>
[0066] In processing block 340, the information management system decomposes the stylized information into atom groups. Each information element may be decomposed according to its atom class as defined by the characteristic information. <br>
[0067] In processing block 350, the information management system processes an atom logic. Each atom may be based on different processing logic. In one embodiment, an information element defined as an Entity atom requires an integrijy check to ensure the entity is consistent with other information in the data store. For example, in a purchase order, a vendor ID information element, classified as an Entity atom, may be checked   . to ensure the vendor exists in the data store.<br>
[0068] In another embodiment, an information element defined as a File atom requires different processing. An information element defined as a File atom may require the system to fetch the filename and path from the data store and subsequently fetching the file using the path.<br><br>
[0069] In one embodiment, the process of a Date atom includes date-related processing. Processing may include conversions between date formats, calculations between dates, and other date-related functions.<br>
[0070] In another embodiment, the process of an Amount atom includes multi-currency transformations. In one embodiment, an entry is created in the transaction currency and the base currency and is stored in the data store. In another embodiment, an atom may provide processes for calculating realized gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses for mark to market posting, translation between transaction currency and base currency, and the like.<br>
[0071] In yet another embodiment, the process of a Duration atom provides duration-dependent processing and translations. In one embodiment, the duration is measured by any unit of time. In another embodiment, the process of a Quantity atom includes unit of measurement related processing. In another embodiment, the process of a Rate . atom includes unit of measurement processing.<br>
[0072] In another embodiment, the process of a Text atom includes language-related localization and personalization. For example, a text may be translated into a local or personalized language prior to persistence and displayed to users. <br>
[0073] In another embodiment, the process of a Text Area atom also includes language-related processing. In one embodiment, the text block is portioned and each portion is saved to the data store as a value. During a fetch operation, one or more lines comprising the text block are assembled and returned.<br>
[0074] Figure 4 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for the formation of a native data manipulation statement in one embodiment. The process is performed by a processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. The processes of Figure 4 are in reference to processing block 240 of Figure 2.<br>
[0075] In processing block 410, the information management system identifies the data storage type. In one embodiment, the system identifies the data storage engine type with which to engage in communication. A data storage engine type may include a relational database, object oriented database, text file, ASCII file, or the like. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the system also identifies the data storage application, such as Oracle, Sybase, DB2, SQL Server, Veritas File System, or the like. <br>
[0076] In processing block 420, the data storage location is identified. In one embodiment, the machine IP with which to communicate, the machine port number on which the storage engine listens, and the storage server instance name within the machine are identified.<br>
[0077] In one embodiment,'the storage location identity is stored in a data directory    . service. In one embodiment, the data directory provides a roadmap to distributed data stores. The data directory includes the information contained in each data store. In one embodiment, the location, data store type, and data store instance in which to store information is specified. In another embodiment, the information is specified at any level in the cell structure, from the Information Type to the data element. <br>
[0078] In one embodiment, the data directory maintains location identities for information type, cells, and information elements. In one embodiment, the location identity includes a uniform resource location (URL). In one embodiment, the information requested may be located in more than one computer or device. For a fetch, change/modify, and delete operation, location identities from the data directory may be requested, and connections to each of the locations identified as containing the requested information may be established. A fetch or select operation may aggregate the return values from different data store locations into a single result. For change/modify or delete operations, the operation may be performed at each location. [0079] For an insert operation, the location identity or identities where the data will be stored is determined, the data directory service may be updated with the location identity or identities of the data, and a connection to the location(s) may be established. A router directs the data to the appropriate locations and the insert operation may be performed at the location(s). In one embodiment, the location identity or identities where the data will be stored is previously defined in the data directory. In one embodiment, the location identity is defined externally from the DBMS. In one embodiment, external data routing includes a user, such as a database administrator, pre-defining a location identification. In another embodiment, location identities are . provided as a dimension of the received information.<br><br>
[0080] In another embodiment, the location identity is defined by the system at runtime through load balancing, availability checks, and data routing rules. In one embodiment, data is routed to different data store types on different physical machines in a distributed data store or in different data store instances. In one embodiment, different portions of information or different information types are routed and stored. [0081] In processing block 430, a data manipulation statement is constructed for the; storage engine type and information management operation.   In one embodiment, a data store interface constructs a native data manipulation syntax from the stylized    « information.<br>
[0082] In one embodiment, the storage location identification is embedded into the data manipulation statement. In one embodiment, the storage location identification specifies the location of a data for use in a distributed storage network, such as a Peer-to-Peer system. More specifically, the identification may include the machine IP, the machine port number on which the storage engine listens, and the storage server instance name within the machine. In one embodiment, storage location identification is pre-defined or provided as a dimension of the received information. In another embodiment, the storage location identification may be generated by the information management system in a storage load-balancing process or storage availability check process.<br>
[0083] Figure 5 is a flow diagram of one embodiment of a process for result composition. The process is performed by a processing logic that may comprise hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, etc.), software (such as is run on a general ,  purpose computer system or a dedicated machine), or a combination of both. In one embodiment, a result is returned to an application for an information management operation. In one embodiment, a result is composed for a fetch, search, select, or similar operation.<br>
[0084] In processing block 510, the information management system receives a return value from a data store. In processing block 520, the system composes a result in a generic XML format or the generic Object structure from the received return value. In one embodiment, the cells are composed back into their original information structure based on the structural and positional identification, such as Cell unique identification (UID), Cell sequence number (Seq Num), Parent Cell UID, and the like. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the structural and positional identification enable the construction of the cell hierarchy of the original cell structure in the information. Moreover, the structural and positional identification may also place a cell in a location among other cells. [0085] In processing block 530, the system may transmit the result. In one embodiment, the result is transmitted to an application initiating data store communication. In another embodiment, the result is transmitted to a toolset to translate the result from the generic XML format or the generic Object structure into an acceptable format for the application.<br>
[0086] Figure 9 is a block diagram illustrating a one embodiment of a transactional unit. In one embodiment, a transactional unit spans multiple interactions with one or more users or processes. In another embodiment, a transaction spans one or more sessions.<br>
[0087] In one embodiment, state management provides transactionality for any type of data store. In one embodiment, the data store has a placeholder for state descriptions for any level of the cell structure. For example, state descriptions may be maintained at the information vacuole level and the Cell level. In another embodiment, transactionality is externalized from the DBMS.<br>
[0088] State descriptions may include 'Tersisted" or "Committed," "Transient," "Error," "Exception," "Depreciated," "Deleted," "Rolled Back," "Time Out," "Archive," and the like. In one embodiment, when all processing has been completed satisfactorily, the state manager may change the state description to "clean" or "committed." In one embodiment, the state description is changed from "dirty" or "transient" to "committed."<br>
[0089] In one embodiment, transactional data from each interaction in a transaction is stored in a data store and is accompanied by a state description. The transactional data may be stored in a "Transient" state. In one embodiment, when a transaction is committed, information, information cells and corresponding elements are transitioned to the "Persisted" state. In one embodiment, the occurrence of an exception during the transaction results in a state transition to "Exception." In one embodiment, if a transition is rolled back, the state transitions to a "Rolled Back" state. Thus, a transaction may span one or more user sessions. In one embodiment, start a transaction, interactions within the transaction, commit the transaction, abort the<br><br>
transaction, and the like, may occur in one or more sessions. In another embodiment, the intervals between sessions are not bounded by time limitations. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a transaction is shared between multiple users or processes. <br>
[0090] In one embodiment, transactional data, including intermediate data, are retained. Thus, for example, in the case a transaction is rolled back, the intermediate data is retained, leaving an audit trail. By retaining the intermediate data, in another embodiment, the erroneous data may be corrected and the transaction may be completed without having to restart the entire transaction. Accordingly, intermediate data within a transaction may be maintained to support long-standing transactions. In another embodiment, the information management system manages transactions in a distributed data store for diverse data store types in a single transaction.<br>
 [0091] In anothe* embodiment, the state descriptions are applied to a higher level of information to manage transactionality. In one embodiment, constructs to begin, commit, and roll back transactions, and to link to another transaction is provided. In another embodiment, the storage management processes manage distributed data storage, real-time data replication capability, storage load balancing, data routing to storage located on a LAN, WAN, and the world-wide-web. The storage management processes may also handle archival and ensure high availability through real-time redundant data storage. In one embodiment, transaction management is externalized from a DBMS.<br>
[0092] Elements of the invention may be embodied in hardware and/or software as a computer program code. The processes described above can be stored in the memory of a computer system as a set of instructions to be executed. In addition, the instructions to perform the processes described above could alternatively be stored on other forms of machine-readable media, including magnetic and optical disks. For . example, the processes described could be stored on machine-readable media, such as magnetic disks or optical disks, which are accessible via a disk drive (or computer-      ! readable medium drive). Further, the instructions can be downloaded into a computing device over a data network in a form of compiled and linked version. <br>
