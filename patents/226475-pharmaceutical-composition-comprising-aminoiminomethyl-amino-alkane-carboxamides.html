A particularly preferred group of compounds of formula<br>
I is constituted in which R2 is selected from a (C6-C14)<br>
aryl group possibly substituted as defined above.<br>
To the knowledge of the Applicant, the<br>
compounds of formula (I) are novel with the exception<br><br>
of Î±-guanidinoacetanilide, which is described by<br>
Mazundar (Indian Drugs 1989, 27, 5, 292), i.e. the<br>
compound of formula I in which R1 = H, R2 = phenyl and<br>
R3 = H .<br>
The invention also relates to the tautomeric<br>
forms, to the enantiomers, diastereoisomers and epimers<br>
of the compounds of general formula (I) .<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) have basic<br>
nitrogen atoms and can be monosalified or disalified by<br>
mineral or organic acids.<br>
with a compound of formula:<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by<br>
reacting a compound of formula:<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
R5 is selected from -SCH3, pyrazolyl or -SO3H,<br>
and<br>
T is a tert-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl<br>
protective group.<br>
The compounds of formula (II) can be prepared<br>
in accordance with a process in which:<br>
a) a compound of formula:<br><br>
in which R2 and R3 are as defined above is reacted with<br>
an acyl halide of general formula (VI) :<br><br><br>
in which:<br>
A is as defined above,<br>
L represents a chlorine or bromine atom or an<br>
activated ester form,<br>
2 represents a chlorine or bromine atom or a<br>
protected amino group,<br>
to form a compound of general formula (VII) :<br><br>
in which R2, R3, A and Z are as defined above;<br>
b) the compound of general formula (VII) is<br>
reacted with potassium phthalimide and then with<br>
hydrazine monohydrate or else with a nitride followed<br>
by a reduction to form a compound of general formula<br>
(II) in which R1 = H.<br>
In the case where 2 is a protected amino group,<br>
it is appropriate to deprotect it at this stage to form<br>
a compound of general formula (II).<br>
The compounds of general formula (II) in which<br>
F1 is other than H can be obtained by reacting a<br>
compound of formula (VII) with an amine of general<br>
formula (VIII):<br><br>
The compositions according to the present<br>
invention are useful in the treatment of pathologies<br>
associated with insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome<br>
K1 .<br><br>
Insulin resistance is characterized by a<br>
reduction in the action of insulin (cf. Presse<br>
Medicale, 1997, 26 (No. 14), 671-677) and is involved<br>
in a large number of pathological states, such as<br>
diabetes and, more particularly, non-insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes (type II diabetes or NIDDM), dyslipidaemia,<br>
obesity,	arterial	hypertension,	and	certain<br>
microvascular and macrovascular complications such as<br>
atherosclerosis, retinopathies and neuropathies.<br>
In this context, reference may be made, for<br>
example, to Diabetes, Vol. 37, 1983, 1595-1607; Journal<br>
of Diabetes and its complications, 1998, 12, 110-119,<br>
or Horm. Res., 1992, 38, 28-32.<br>
In particular, the compositions of the<br>
invention exhibit a strong hypoglycaemic activity.<br>
The compositions according to the present<br>
invention can also be used for treating the chronic<br>
complications due to the formation of "advanced<br>
glycosylation end products", written AGEs, which result<br>
from the glycoxidation reaction between glucose, its<br>
oxidation derivatives and the amino functions of<br>
proteins, including the so-called Maillard reactions of<br>
glycation of glyoxal for example.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to<br>
the invention can be provided in forms which are<br>
intended for parenteral, oral, rectal, permucous or<br>
percutaneous administration.<br>
They will therefore be provided in the form of<br>
solutions or suspensions for injection or multi-dose<br>
bottles, in the form of plain or coated tablets, film-<br>
coated tablets, wafer capsules, gelatin capsules,<br>
pills, cachets, powders, suppositories or rectal<br>
capsules, or solutions or suspensions for percutaneous<br>
use in a polar solvent or for permucous use.<br>
The excipients which are suitable for such<br>
administrations are derivatives of cellulose or<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, alkaline earth metal<br>
carbonates, magnesium phosphate, starches, modified<br>
searches, and lactose for the solid forms.<br><br>
For rectal use, cocoa butter or polyethylene<br>
glycol stearates are the preferred excipients.<br>
For parenteral use, water, aqueous solutions,<br>
physiological saline and isotonic solutions are the<br>
vehicles used most judiciously.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits (from<br>
0.5 mg to 1000 mg) depending on the therapeutic<br>
indication and the administration route, and also on<br>
the age and weight of the individual.<br>
The following examples illustrate the<br>
preparation of the compounds of formula (I) and of<br>
various intermediates.<br>

The results of pharmacological studies will be<br>
given below.<br>
STUDY OF THE ANTIDIABETIC ACTIVITY IN THE NOSTZ RAT<br>
The antidiabetic activity of the compounds of<br>
formula (I) was determined orally on an experimental<br>
model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes induced in the<br>
rat using streptozotocin.<br>
The model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes is<br>
obtained in rats by neonatal injection (on the day of<br>
birth) of streptozotocin.<br>
The diabetic rats used are 8 weeks old. The<br>
animals are kept from the day of their birth to the day<br>
of the experiment in an animal house at a regulated<br>
temperature of from 21 to 22Â°C and are subjected to a<br>
fixed cycle of light (from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm) and<br>
darkness (from 7.00 pm to 7.00 am). Their diet<br>
consisted of a maintenance diet; water and food were<br>
provided ad libitum, except for the 2 hours' fasting<br>
prior to the tests in which food is withdrawn (post-<br>
absorptive state).<br>
The rats are treated orally for one (d1) or<br>
four (d4) days with the test product. Two hours after<br>
the final administration of the product and 30 minutes<br>
after anaesthesia of the animals with sodium<br>
pentobarbital (NembutalÂ®), 300 ml of blood is sampled<br>
from the end of the tail.<br>
Results obtained are collated, by way of<br>
example, in Table 5. These results demonstrate the<br>
efficacy of the compounds of formula (I) in reducing<br>
glycaemia in diabetic animals. These results are<br>
expressed as a percentage change in glycaemia on dl and<br>
d4 (number of days of treatment) relative to dO (before<br>
treatment).<br><br><br><br>
STUDY OF THE ANTIGLYCOXIDATION ACTIVITY<br>
The compounds (I) are also capable of<br>
inhibiting the so-called Maillard reactions by means of<br>
a "scavenging" effect on Î±-dicarbonyl derivatives such<br>
as glyoxal - this is the antiglycation effect. This<br>
inhibitory effect on the Maillard reaction by the<br>
compounds of formula (I) was studied in vitro by<br>
assaying the ketamines ("fructoamines") produced during<br>
the incubation of albumin with methyiglyoxai in the<br>
presence or absence of a compound of formula (I).<br>
A 6.6 mg/ml solution of bovine albumin in 0.2 M<br>
phosphate buffer pH 7.4 is incubated with 1 mM<br>
methyiglyoxal in the presence or absence of a compound<br>
according to the invention at a concentration of 1 mM.<br>
The incubation is carried out under sterile conditions<br>
at 37Â°C for 6 days. At the end of the incubation<br>
period, the amount of ketamines is measured with a<br>
commercially available fructoamine assay kit (kit<br>
"FRA", product reference: 0757055, Roche S.A. products)<br>
in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Under these experimental conditions, the level of<br>
fructoamine following incubation of albumin with<br>
methylglyoxal in the presence of a compound of formula<br>
(I) is from 30 to 50% lower than that observed when<br>
albumin is incubated with methyiglyoxai in the absence<br>
of the compound of fornula (I) .<br><br>
