				<td>GEAR-SHIFTING DEVICE<br>
The present invention relates to a gear-shifting device for selecting and shifting gears of a gearbox, especially for motor vehicles, comprising a plurality of gear-shifting elements, which are displaceably mounted in such a way as to actuate associated gearshift sleeves in the axial direction and which each have a driving element; a rotatably and displaceably mounted gearshift lever shaft having a shift finger that selectively acts upon one driving element at a time in order to drive the respective gear-shifting element during a movement of the gearshift lever shaft; and a shifting gate.<br>
Such a gear-shifting device is disclosed by EP 0 893 628 Al.<br>
Such gear-shifting devices are particularly suited to manual shift transmissions, but in principle are also suitable for automated manual shift transmissions, double-clutch transmissions, etc.<br><br>
2<br>
The gear-shifting elements may take the form, for example, of gearshift forks or gearshift rockers.<br>
The shifting gate or shifting guide generally serves for positioning the driving elements in relation to the shift finger.<br>
In the known gear-shifting systems this may be achieved, for example, by centering the gearshift fork caliper on the respective gearshift sleeve.<br>
However, this leads to large deviations of the driving element position from the intended position. This adversely affects the gear-shifting comfort. Concentricity tolerances of the gearshift sleeve are transmitted to the gearshift fork and the shift finger. This adversely affects the feel of the gearshift.<br>
In the state of the art the positioning of the driving elements in relation to the shift finger is alternatively performed by a shifting gate, in which each driving element is guided individually. This is disclosed, for example, in EP 0 893 628 Al cited above.<br>
The shifting gate in EP 0 893 628 Al has three separate gate channels for the three driving elements, the gate channels being interconnected by a central channel.<br>
This leads to a very good positioning of the driving elements in relation to one another and in relation to the shift finger. A disadvantage, however, is that the driving elements are spaced comparatively far apart. This is perceived as disadvantageous when performing the gear selection (changing channel).<br>
A further disadvantage of known gear-shifting devices is that a transmission of the shift travel in reverse gear shifting by means of a sliding-mesh gear can be accomplished only by a costly mechanism, comprising a plurality of parts.<br><br>
3<br>
DE 102 13 668 Al furthermore discloses a gear-shifting device for a gearbox, in which a gearshift lever shaft is moved in a longitudinal direction for selecting gears and in a rotational direction for shifting gears. The gearshift lever shaft is guided on a housing, on which a shifting gate is provided. The shifting gate guides only the gearshift lever shaft, so that oscillations of the gearshift forks may be transmitted to the gearshift lever shaft and hence to the shift linkage.<br>
Against this background, the object of the invention is to specify an improved gear-shifting device for selecting and shifting gears of a gearbox.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, this object is achieved in the case of the aforementioned gear-shifting device in that at least two gear-shifting elements are guided in the axial direction against each other (reciprocally) and that these gear-shifting elements are guided as a group (package) in the shifting gate.<br>
This ensures a precise guiding of the driving elements, especially in relation to the shift finger.<br>
Tolerances between the gearbox gear trains (gear wheel sets) and the bearing for the gear-shifting device in the housing can be offset, so that the gear shift quality is not adversely affected.<br>
There is no need for any centering of the gear-shifting elements (gearshift forks) by means of the respective gearshift sleeves. The gear-shifting elements can therefore be configured and designed so that they do not touch the respective gearshift sleeve. This isolation reduces the transmission of impulses from the gearbox to the gear-shifting device and via a shift linkage to a manual gearshift lever, for example, and ideally even prevents them completely.<br>
The reciprocal guiding of the gear-shifting elements in the axial direction can be accomplished by defined surfaces on the gear-shifting elements.<br><br>
4<br>
Since the gear-shifting elements are guided as a group in the shifting gate, the distance between the driving elements can be kept very small, which significantly improves the gearshift comfort when selecting gears (changing channel). This measure also serves to minimize the reciprocal tolerances.<br>
The shifting gate may be furnished by a shift control housing, for example, which may be built from sheet metal, for example.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention the aforesaid object is achieved in the case of the aforementioned gear-shifting device in that a gear-shifting element for a reverse gear is coupled directly to the driving element of a gear-shifting element, with which only a single forward gear is associated.<br>
This allows the design construction for operation of the reverse gear, especially by means of a sliding-mesh gear, to be considerably simplified.<br>
Overall therefore, the component cost and possibly also the weight of the gear-shifting device can be reduced.<br>
The aforesaid object is therefore achieved in full.<br>
In the case of the first aspect of the invention it is advantageous if the gear-shifting elements each have a gear-shifting element body, to which the respective driving element is fixed.<br>
In general, the driving element and the gear-shifting element body can be integrally formed. It is especially preferred, however, if the driving element is manufactured as a separate component (for example, a hardened component), which is connected to the gear-shifting element body.<br><br>
5<br>
A caliper for gripping a respective gearshift sleeve is generally provided on the gear-shifting element body.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment the driving elements of the gear-shifting elements are guided as a group in the shifting gate.<br>
Although it is generally feasible to guide another section of the gear-shifting elements as a group in the shifting gate, the said embodiment is especially preferred.<br>
In this way a durable shifting gate guide can be achieved, especially when the driving elements are manufactured from an abrasion-resistant material.<br>
Since the driving elements are generally actuated by means of a single shift finger of the gearshift lever shaft, the driving elements ought furthermore to be arranged close next to one another anyway, for design reasons. It is therefore also particularly advantageous in design terms to guide the driving elements as a group in the shifting gate.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment the driving elements of the gear-shifting elements are spaced at a distance from one another.<br>
Although the driving elements could generally also lie in direct contact with one another (that is without any spacing), a certain spacing, if only a very small one, is advantageous, since this makes it possible to reduce the reciprocal friction. This embodiment moreover affords advantages in terms of production engineering, especially when driving elements are cast into a gear-shifting element body.<br>
It goes without saying here that the spacing can as a rule be significantly less than in the state of the art, in which the driving elements are guided in individual channels of a shifting gate guide, that is to say not in a "group".<br><br>
6<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment the gear-shifting elements are reciprocally guided on sections outside the shifting gate.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible, however, for the gear-shifting elements to be reciprocally guided on sections inside the shifting gate.<br>
In the latter embodiment it is, in particular, feasible for the shift finger to be guided outside the shifting gate, although this need not necessarily be the case.<br>
Overall, it is furthermore advantageous if three gear-shifting elements are reciprocally guided in the axial direction, one of the gear-shifting elements being guided between the other two gear-shifting elements.<br>
It is equally feasible, however, for more than three gear-shifting elements to be guided as a group in the shifting gate.<br>
It is particularly advantageous when using three gear-shifting elements, however, if the driving element of the middle gear-shifting element is guided between the gear-shifting element bodies of the other two gear-shifting elements.<br>
In this case defined surfaces can be formed on the gear-shifting element bodies of the other two gear-shifting elements relatively easily.<br>
A particular advantage in this development is furthermore that the machining of the surfaces on the gear-shifting element bodies of the other two gear-shifting elements can be undertaken once the driving elements have been connected to the respective gear-shifting element bodies. This allows the driving elements to be fitted (for exam-pled, molded in) to the gearshift fork bodies with large tolerances. Since the defined surfaces on the gear-shifting element bodies are only produced subsequently, a high degree of precision can be achieved in the guide, even if the driving elements them-<br><br>
7<br>
selves are fitted to the gear-shifting element bodies with comparatively large tolerances.<br>
With more than three gear-shifting elements it is feasible, for example, to always guide a gear-shifting element body alternately on a driving element. This also affords similar advantages with more than three gear-shifting elements.<br>
It is furthermore preferred overall, if the group is guided on the shifting gate on two axially aligned and opposing sides of the group.<br>
In other words it is possible, in this "group" guiding, to guide all gear-shifting elements of the gear-shifting device according to the invention accurately by just two defined guide faces on the shifting gate.<br>
It is of particular advantage here if the shifting gate takes the form of an approximately rectangular opening in a gate component (such as the shift control housing) aligned approximately axially, inside which the group is guided.<br>
Although a rectangular shape is generally easy to produce, a shape may be preferred in which the guide faces of the generally rectangular opening are narrower in the outer areas and somewhat wider in the middle area. This means that the shift finger can project into the shifting gate, the shifting gate being able to form the selector stop for the shift finger.<br>
The embodiment according to the second aspect of the invention can likewise be advantageously combined with the subject matter of the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In the second aspect of the invention it is furthermore advantageous if the reverse gear-shifting element is supported so that it can pivot about an axis which is aligned transversely to the axial direction.<br><br>
8<br>
This makes it possible for the reverse gear-shifting element to actuate the reverse gear through a pivoting movement, for example through displacement of a sliding wheel of the reverse gear in an axial direction.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment of the second aspect of the invention the reverse gear-shifting element is pivotally supported on a gate component, on which the shifting gate is formed.<br>
This allows the number of components to be further reduced. The gate component (such as the shift control housing) can therefore serve both for forming the shifting gate and hence for guiding the gear-shifting elements, and also for supporting the reverse gear-shifting element.<br>
Overall, it is advantageous if the reverse gear-shifting element takes the form of a lever, which at one end is coupled to the driving element of the associated forward gear-shifting element and which at its other end interacts with a gear of the reverse gear, the gear-shifting element being pivotally supported in an area between them.<br>
This particular measure means that a wheel such as a sliding wheel of the reverse gear can be actuated with just one component, that is to say the reverse gear-shifting element in the form of a lever.<br>
It is to be noted, however, that an interaction with a wheel of the reverse gear may also be understood in a sense that the reverse gear is actuated by means of a gearshift sleeve, which connects a loose gear of the gearbox to a shaft.<br>
It is furthermore advantageous overall if the reverse gear-shifting element can be arrested in two positions by a detent device.<br>
In this case the one position is generally the position in which the reverse gear is engaged. The other position corresponds to a neutral position, it being possible to<br><br>
9<br>
use the associated driving element in this second position to engage (shift) the forward gear associated therewith.<br>
It is also advantageous overall if the coupling between the reverse gear-shifting element and the driving element of the forward gear-shifting element is designed so that the reverse gear-shifting element is not driven by the driving element when the latter is moved in a direction for the engagement of the associated forward gear.<br>
It is of particular advantage here if the reverse gear-shifting element interacts with a lock, which locks the reverse gear-shifting element when the forward gear-shifting element is moved in a direction for the engagement of the associated forward gear or when this forward gear is engaged.<br>
At the same time it is of particular advantage if the lock is formed by the actual driving element thus moved.<br>
In this way it is possible, by simple means and without the cost of additional components, to prevent simultaneous actuation of the reverse gear whilst the forward gear is engaged.<br>
Overall, it is likewise preferable if the gearshift lever shaft is supported so that it is displaced for the selection of gears and rotated for the shifting of gears.<br>
The features specified above and those yet to be explained below can obviously be used not only in the respective combination specified, but also in other combinations or singly, without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>

In Fig. 1 a first embodiment of the gear-shifting device according to the invention is generally denoted by 10.<br>
The gear-shifting device 10 serves for the engagement of gears of a gearbox for motor vehicles, especially a manual shift gearbox of conventional type (for example of intermediate transmission type).<br><br>
11<br>
More specifically, the gear-shifting device 10 serves for the engagement and disengagement of forward gears 1 to 5, which are each engaged and disengaged through displacement of the respective gearshift sleeves on a shaft of the gearbox. The gear-shifting device 10 furthermore serves for the engagement of a reverse gear of the gearbox, the reverse gear being engaged and disengaged through displacement of a sliding-mesh gear.<br>
The gear-shifting device 10 has a gearshift lever shaft 12, which is rotated for the shifting, that is to say the engagement and disengagement of gears, as is shown by 14. For selecting gears or channels, the gearshift lever shaft 12 is displaced in a longitudinal direction, as shown by 16 in Fig. 1.<br>
In a typical application the gearshift lever shaft 12 can be coupled by way of a shift linkage to a manual gearshift lever, by means of which a driver of the motor vehicle can manually engage and disengage the gears.<br>
Alternatively it is also feasible, however, for the gearshift lever shaft 12 to be connected to an actuator, for example a hydraulic or electromechanical actuator arrangement.<br>
The gear-shifting device 10 has a first gearshift fork 20A for the forward gears 1/2, a second gearshift fork 20B for the forward gears 3/4 and a third gearshift fork 20C for the forward gear 5 and the reverse gear.<br>
The gearshift forks 20 are supported at their axial ends so that they are each axially displaceable through bearing sleeves 26 and 28. The axes 30 of the three gearshift forks 20 are aligned parallel to one another and likewise run parallel to a shifting direction 32, in which gearshift sleeves of the associated gearbox are moved in order to engage and disengage gears.<br><br>
12<br>
A peripheral groove 34 is recessed into one of the bearing sleeve (in this case the bearing sleeve 28). This groove serves for arresting the associated gearshift fork 20. The gearshift fork 20A, for example, can be arrested in a neutral position.<br>
Numeral 36 further represents a gearshift rocker, which serves for the engagement and disengagement of the reverse gear.<br>
Each of the gearshift forks 20 has a gearshift fork body 40, which may be manufactured from a lightweight cast material, such as aluminum casting.<br>
The gearshift fork bodies 40 each have a fork section 42, which is designed to engage in a peripheral groove of an associated gearshift sleeve, in order to form a positive interlock with this in an axial direction.<br>
The gearshift fork bodies 40 furthermore each have a longitudinal section 44 aligned in the axial direction 30 and a lateral section 46 extending transversely thereto. A driving element 48 is fitted to the end of each of the lateral sections 46. The driving elements 48 may each be made of steel, for example of hardened steel. The driving elements 48 can be connected to the respective gearshift fork bodies 40, for example, by casting the driving elements 48 into the gearshift fork body 40.<br>
The three driving elements 48 of the three gearshift forks 20 are aligned towards the gearshift lever shaft 12 and at the end face pointing towards the gearshift lever shaft 12 each have a recess. A shift finger 50 is fixed to the gearshift lever shaft 12.<br>
The shift finger 50 is of dimensions such that it engages in a recess of one driving element 48 at a time and can move, through rotation 14, the respective driving element 48 and hence the associated gearshift fork 20 in an axial direction 30 or 32.<br>
In order to illustrate the operating principle of the gear-shifting device 10 in more detail, a detail of a gearbox 58 is shown in the area of the fork section 42C of the<br><br>
13<br>
third gearshift fork 20C. The gearbox 58 has a shaft 56, which is aligned parallel to the axial direction 30. A loose gear 54 for the forward gear 5 is rotatably supported on the shaft 56.<br>
Also supported so that it is axially displaceable on the shaft 56 is a gearshift sleeve 52, which is designed in a manner known in the art to establish a positively interlocking connection between the shaft 56 and the loose gear 54, in order to engage the forward gear 5.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the gear-shifting device 10, but with reverse gear engaged, and from this it can be seen that the driving element 48C is axially displaced from a basic position (in which the other driving elements 48A, 48C are situated), through rotation of the gearshift lever shaft 12. When the driving element 48C is moved in the opposite direction and beyond the middle position or neutral position by means of the shift finger 50, the gearshift fork 20C drives the gearshift sleeve 52 in an axial direction, in order to thereby engage the forward gear 5.<br>
The gear-shifting device 10 furthermore has a gate component 60, which may be formed from sheet metal, for example. The gate component 60, which is also referred to as a shift control housing, has a base plate 62, which is aligned parallel to the shifting direction 32 and parallel to the gearshift lever shaft 12.<br>
The gate component 60 furthermore has a cross plate 64, which is aligned parallel to the shifting direction 32 and perpendicular to the gearshift lever shaft 12. The gearshift lever shaft 12 is carried through the first cross plate 64 and is displaceably and rotatably supported thereby.<br>
The gate component 60 furthermore has a second cross plate 66, which is aligned perpendicular to the shifting direction 32 and parallel to the gearshift lever shaft 12. Two fixing sleeves 68, which serve to fix the gate component 60 to a housing of the gearbox 58, are formed on the second cross plate 66.<br><br>
14<br>
A shifting gate 70 in the form of an approximately rectangular opening is formed in the base plate 62 of the gate component 60. The three driving elements 48A, 48B, 48C of the three gearshift forks 20A, 20B, 20C are guided as a group inside the shifting gate 70. This ensures a precise guiding to the shift finger 50 and, where appropriate, to a gear lock (not shown).<br>
The gear lock (not shown) ensures, in a manner known in the art, that only one of the three gearshift forks 20 at a time can be displaced from the middle position into a shift position.<br>
Guiding as a group inside the shifting gate 70 means that tolerances between the gear trains of the gearbox 58 and the bearing of the gear-shifting device can be offset in the transmission case. These tolerances have no adverse effect on the quality of the gearshift.<br>
It also makes it possible for the gearshift forks 20 not to touch the respective gearshift sleeves, at least in the neutral position. In other words, there is no need for a centering of the gearshift forks 20 by the respectively associated gearshift sleeves. The transmission of impulses from the gearbox 58 to the gear-shifting device can therefore be prevented or at least reduced.<br>
As will be explained further below, the reciprocal guiding of the driving elements 48 can be achieved by producing defined surfaces, which run on the driving element 48B of the gearshift fork 20B, on the gearshift fork bodies 40A, 40C.<br>
Since the shifting gate 70 does not have any separate channels of its own for the driving elements, but basically takes the form of a rectangular opening, the reciprocal spacing of the driving elements 48 can be minimized. This serves to improve the gear-shifting comfort when changing channel. This can also be achieved, in particular, by minimizing the mutual tolerances of the driving elements 48.<br><br>
15<br>
The gearshift rocker 36 for the reverse gear is also supported on the gate component 60 or the shift control housing. For this purpose a rocker pivot 72, the pivot axis 74 of which is aligned perpendicular to the shifting direction 32 and perpendicular to the gearshift lever shaft 12, is arranged on the base plate 62.<br>
A detent device 76, only indicated schematically in Fig. 1, for the gearshift rocker 36, is furthermore arranged on the gate component 60.<br>
This measure allows the gearshift rocker 36 to be supported simply and directly on the gate component 60 used for the driving element guide. Furthermore, as will be explained below, shifting movements of the shift finger 50 can be transmitted directly to the gearshift rocker 36 by the driving element 48C of the gearshift fork 20C.<br>
Overall, therefore, this results in a very small number of parts with low tolerances.<br>
Fig. 2 and 3 each show cross-sectional views of the gear-shifting device 10 from different sides. Fig. 2a shows a detail 2a from Fig. 2.<br>
It can be seen that a guide face 84 and 85 is formed on the lateral section 46A of the gearshift fork 20A and on the lateral section 46C of the gearshift fork 20C, respectively, the driving element 48B of the second gearshift fork 20B running between these guide faces 84, 85. For the guide face 85 this is shown in detail Fig. 2a.<br>
The guide faces 84 and 85 are preferably machined only after the driving elements 48 have been fitted to the respective gearshift fork bodies 40. This measure allows the guide faces 84, 85, for example, to be machined precisely to the contact face of the respective driving element in the shifting gate 70 of the gate component 60. This measure enables the driving elements 48 to be fixed to the gearshift fork body 40, and in particular cast into the latter, with relatively large tolerances.<br><br>
16<br>
It can further be seen from Fig. 2a that in order to prevent excessive friction the guide faces 84, 85 are machined only over a limited section. A gap 86 is moreover arranged between the lateral sections 46A, 46C and the driving element 48B.<br>
As is shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the three driving elements 48 protrude in relation to the gearshift fork bodies 40 in a transverse direction to the shifting direction and are guided as a group in the shifting gate 70. The gearshift lever shaft 12 is aligned so that the shift finger 50 likewise intrudes into the shifting gate 70, but from the other side of the base plate 62.<br>
The three driving elements 48 form a driving element group 92, which inside the shifting gate 70 is guided on an upper guide face 88 and a lower guide face 90.<br>
More specifically, an upper side of the driving element 48A bears against the guide face 88. An underside of the driving element 48C bears against the lower guide face 90.<br>
Since the guide faces 88, 90 are aligned parallel to the shifting direction 32, the group 92 comprising the driving elements 48 can be precisely guided in the shifting direction 32.<br>
Fig. 3a shows a modified embodiment 10' of the gear-shifting device 10 in Fig. 1 to 3.<br>
In the gear-shifting device 10' the guide faces 84', 85' are aligned between the gearshift fork bodies 40A', 40C' and the driving element 48B' inside the shifting gate 70'. An even more precise guidance can thereby be achieved.<br>
In this embodiment the shift finger 50' does not extend into the shifting gate 70' but acts upon sections of the driving elements 48', which protrude from the base plate 62' towards the gearshift lever shaft 12'.<br><br>
17<br>
In this embodiment an even more precise guidance can be achieved. Fig. 4 shows a side view along the line IV-IV in Fig. 3.<br>
It will firstly be seen from the representation in Fig. 4 that the shifting gate 70 is not exactly rectangular but in the shifting direction is of narrower design in the outer areas and somewhat wider in the middle area.<br>
In Fig. 4, moreover, the gearshift rocker 36 for the reverse gear is shown more accurately.<br>
The gearshift rocker 36 is pivotally supported on the gate component 60 in the manner of a first-class lever. An upper end of the gearshift rocker 36 is designed to engage with the driving element 48C, by means of a driving jaw 94.<br>
A lower section of the gearshift rocker 36 takes the form of a fork section 98 and is designed to move a sliding mesh gear (wheel) 99 for the reverse gear in the shifting direction 32.<br>
A detent contour 96, which forms a part of the detent device 76, is furthermore formed on a lateral section of the gearshift rocker 36. The detent device 76 provides two detent positions of the gearshift rocker 36, a neutral position N and a shift position R for the reverse gear.<br>
The pivoting direction of the gearshift rocker 36 is represented by 100 in Fig. 4.<br>
The dwell force applied to the detent contour 96 by the detent device (for example, a detent ball and spring) is represented schematically by 102 in Fig. 4. The detent device may also be formed by a shaped spring with detent lug or a torsion spring with latch pin.<br><br>
18<br>
At the upper end the gearshift rocker 36 has an engagement shift lug 103 and a disengagement shift lug 105, between which the driving jaw 94 is disposed.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the gearshift rocker 36 in the neutral position N. Here the engagement shift lug 103 lies approximately on a level with the driving element 48C. The disengagement shift lug 105 on the other hand is situated below the driving element 48C.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a view comparable to Fig. 4, the reverse gear R being engaged.<br>
For this purpose the driving element 48C is displaced by means of the shift finger 50. The driving element 48C inside the driving jaw 94 acts on the engagement shift lug 103 and rotates the gearshift rocker 36 in the direction 100, until the gearshift rocker 36 engages in position R by means of the detent device 76. The sliding mesh gear 99 is thereby displaced in the shifting direction 32 and the reverse gear is engaged.<br>
A particular feature of this is that the shift travel of the driving element 48C is transmitted by the gearshift rocker 36 with a ratio that is due to the differing lever length in respect of the pivot axis 74. In this case the transmission ratio is 1:3.<br>
A further peculiarity is that in shifting into the reverse gear the gearshift fork 20C performs an idle stroke without actuating any synchromesh.<br>
The configuration of the detent contour 96 makes it possible to define the gearshift force curve in engaging and disengaging the reverse gear R.<br>
It can furthermore be seen from Fig. 5 that due to the tilting movement of the gearshift rocker 36 the disengagement shift lug 105 now lies on a level with the driving element 48C. The reverse gear can therefore be disengaged again by a return travel of the driving element 48C.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a view comparable to Fig. 4, the forward gear 5 being engaged.<br><br>
19<br>
It can be seen that the gearshift rocker 36 is here not moved in relation to the neutral position (Fig. 4).<br>
It can be seen, however, that with the forward gear 5 engaged the driving element 48C has moved over the engagement shift lug 105, thereby arresting the gearshift rocker 36 in the neutral position N. This measure means that the driving element 48C together with the disengagement shift lug 105 forms a shift lock 104 for the reverse gear.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further modified embodiment of a gear-shifting device 10". The gear-shifting device 10" generally corresponds to the gear-shifting device 10 of Fig. 1 to 6 in its construction and function. Only the differences will be examined below.<br>
In the gear-shifting device 10" the driving elements 48" are each integrally formed with the gearshift fork bodies 40" and are guided as a group 92" without reciprocal spacing in a shifting gate 70" of a gate component 60".<br>
All in all, the gear-shifting device according to the invention affords at last one of the following advantages:<br>
By isolating from the gear train and by combining all moving parts in a gearshift sub-assembly it is possible to minimize tolerances, thereby improving the quality of the gearshift.<br>
The isolation furthermore serves to prevent the transmission of impulses through the gear train to the gear-shifting device.<br>
The number of parts required for operation of the reverse gear can be reduced.<br>
Modified production methods and the pre-assembly of the gearshift sub-assembly make it possible to minimize the costs of manufacture and assembly.<br><br>
