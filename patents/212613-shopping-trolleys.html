				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to shopping trolleys. The invention also relates to a vehicle, and to a<br>
vehicle assembly comprising the shopping trolley and a vehicle.<br>
DE 196 11 542 discloses a shopping trolley, which can be loaded into the boot of a vehicle<br>
without requiring lifting of the trolley by a user. The undercarriage of the trolley of DE 196 11<br>
542 collapses by forced engagement with the rear of the vehicle into which the trolley is to be<br>
loaded. This has a number of disadvantages when compared to the present invention.<br>
EP 0 286 520 and EP 100 50 915 describes a trolley which require lifting into the boot after they<br>
have been collapsed. No such arrangement is found in the prior art which would facilitate loading<br>
and unloading of purchased goods to and from the boot of the vehicle, while the goods are<br>
contained in the trolley, in that no stooping or lifting by a user of the trolley is required.<br>
The invention provides a shopping trolley which includes : a holder for holding articles of<br>
shopping or for holding a basket, tray or bag containing articles of shopping; and a wheeled<br>
undercarriage connected to the holder, the undercarriage being operable between an erected<br>
condition, in which the undercarriage supports the holder at a working height above the ground<br>
on wheels, and a collapsed compact condition, for loading of the trolley into a boot or trunk of a<br>
passenger sedan.<br>
It will be appreciated that the shopping trolley is intended for use with a vehicle, and that the<br>
vehicle and the shopping trolley will be shaped for co-operation with each other, particularly<br>
during storage of the shopping trolley in the boot of the car when the trolley is in its collapsed<br>
condition. The shopping trolley can thus, instead, be seen primarily as a vehicle accessory.<br>
A feature of the trolley, in its collapsed condition, is that it can fit into a boot or trunk of a<br>
passenger sedan of average size, to function as a boot or trunk divider or organiser. The trolley<br>
may thus, when it is in its collapsed condition and is supported on a floor of a vehicle boot, have a<br>
length dimension of 0,5-0, 9 m, preferably 0,6-0, 8 m, a height dimension of 0,3-0, 6 m,<br>
preferably 0,4-0, 5 m, and a width dimension of 0,3-0, 6 m, preferably 0,4-0, 5 m.<br>
The shopping trolley may be supportable on a floor of a vehicle boot, when the undercarriage is<br>
in its collapsed condition, such that the holder has an orientation relative to the vertical similar to<br>
the orientation of the holder when the undercarriage is in its extended condition and supports the<br>
holder on the ground, so that the holder provides a boot organiser. Typically, the holder is a<br>
shopping basket or tray which faces upwardly when the trolley is collapsed and is supported in<br>
the boot, but the holder can be any other arrangement for holding articles of shopping, for<br>
instance being a plurality of shopping bags. By holder is thus not only meant a basket, tray, bag,<br>
or other container for holding articles of shopping, but also an arrangement or formation for<br>
holding a basket, tray, or bag which contains articles of shopping.<br>
The spacing of the holder from the ground surface, when the undercarriage is in its erected<br>
condition, will be such that the holder is accessible to a person of average height in normal<br>
stance, i. e. it is of normal shopping trolley height, the spacing being greater than 0,4 m,<br>
preferably being 0,45-0, 6 m. Conveniently, the spacing of the holder, from the ground surface,<br>
when the undercarriage is in its erected conditions, is variable.<br>
The holderwill define a storage space which may conveniently be divided into a number of<br>
compartments. In a preferred embodiment, the shopping trolley may include a number of durable<br>
shopping bags which are receivable in the storage space of the holder, the bags for ining a<br>
permanent part of the accessory, being removable from the holder and being intended for<br>
repeated use. This is in contrast to conventional more or less disposable shopping bags which are<br>
. of flexible thin-walled sheet-like plastic material.<br>
The bags may thus be of a woven flexible plastics textile material, or the bags may be of a woven<br>
natural material.<br>
The bags may be of a substantially liquid-impervious material. In a particular embodiment of the<br>
invention, at least some of the bags are divided into separate chambers. At least one of the bags<br>
may be insulated to provide thermally insulated storage chambers. Some of the storage chambers<br>
may be padded to inhibit damage, in use, of fragile articles, such as glass articles, stored in the<br>
storage chambers.<br>
Furthermore, partitions which separate the respective storage chambers from one another may be<br>
provided with stiffening, to inhibit bruising of articles of produce, such as soft fruit, stored in the<br>
storage chambers. Each bag may have a closure mechanism, for example a slide fastener, for<br>
openably closing the bags, the bags preferably being liquid-tight when they are closed.<br>
The undercarriage will have a set of wheels such as rollers for engaging the<br>
support surface to provide mobility of the undercarriage. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
set of rollers comprises a set of four wheels which are arranged in a rectangular<br>
configuration in plan view, when the undercarriage is in its erected condition, each roller<br>
being freely swivelable about an associated upright swivel axis. The undercarriage may<br>
be sufficiently strong to support a load of at least 50kg in the holder, when the<br>
undercarriage is in its erected condition.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the undercarriage comprises a<br>
pair of elongate curved legs which are part-circular in shape, a set of wheels being<br>
mounted on the pair of legs, each leg being slidably mounted on an associated frame-<br>
member such that each leg is slidably displaceable between an extended position in which<br>
the leg projects from its associated frame member for engagement of the wheels mounted<br>
on that leg with the ground, the leg being arranged more or less end-to-end with the<br>
associated frame member, and a retracted position in which the leg is retracted relative to<br>
its associated frame member. Each leg may thus be telescopically received in the<br>
associated frame member, to be telescopically slidable between its extended position and<br>
its retracted position, so that, in the retracted position, each leg is located within the<br>
associated frame member, each frame member having a part-circular shape corresponding<br>
to the shape of the legs, to permit telescopic sliding of the legs in a circumferential<br>
direction. The legs and the frame members may be non-circular, typically rectangular, in<br>
cross-section, to restrict angular displacement of the legs about their longitudinal directions<br>
within the associated frame members.<br>
Conveniently, each leg has mounted thereon a displaceable handle such<br>
that, when the leg is in its extended position, the associated handle is located adjacent a<br>
rear of the trolley, in its fore-and-aft direction, for gripping by a user, each handle being<br>
pivotally displaceable relative to the associated frame member about a pivot axis which<br>
extends transversely to the fore-and-aft direction of the trolley in its erected condition, so<br>
that, when the leg is in its retracted position, the handle is pivotally displaceable about its<br>
pivot axis towards the associated frame member to lie adjacent the frame member. Each<br>
handle may conveniently be curved, having a radius of curvature similar to that of the<br>
frame members, so that when the handle lies adjacent the associated frame member, it<br>
hugs the curve of the frame member.<br>
To permit sliding displacement of each leg in the associated frame member,<br>
the frame member will typically be generally tubular, having a longitudinally extending slot<br>
through which mounting formations on the leg for mounting of the wheels and/or the<br>
handles can project and along which said mounting formations are slidable during<br>
telescoping of the leg along the frame member.<br>
Each leg may thus have mounted thereon a pair of wheels spaced along the<br>
length of the leg, each wheel being spaced from the associated leg by an elongate foot<br>
which is pivotally connected at one end thereof to the leg for pivotal displacement about<br>
a pivot axis which extends transversely to the fore-and-aft direction of the shopping trolley,<br>
the associated wheel being provided at the opposite end of the foot, each foot being<br>
pivotally displaceable between a stowed position in which it lies adjacent the associated<br>
leg, and an operative position in which it projects transversely from the associated leg, so<br>
that the associated wheel is spaced from said leg by the length of the foot for engagement<br>
with the ground.<br>
Each part-circular leg and its associated part-circular frame member may, in<br>
the erected condition of the undercarriage, lie in a more or less vertical plane and define<br>
a gap between their ends at a front of the trolley in the fore-and-aft direction of the<br>
shopping trolley, said gap being sufficiently large to straddle a rear portion of an open boot<br>
of a passenger sedan when the shopping trolley is wheeled towards the boot of the vehicle,<br>
in use, so that part of the legs is receivable in a space between the ground and the rear<br>
of the vehicle, the frame members engaging the rear of the vehicle, to rest thereon. This<br>
facilitates collapsing of the undercarriage by telescoping retraction of the legs while the<br>
remainder of the trolley is supported by resting on the vehicle.<br>
Typically, the radius of curvature of the legs and the frame members is 0,3<br>
m - 0,5 m, preferably being about 0,4 m.<br>
Conveniently, the shopping trolley includes an auxiliary holder for holding<br>
articles of shopping, the auxiliary holder being removably and replaceably connectable to<br>
the legs to extend between the legs when they are in their extended positions, the auxiliary<br>
holder additionally serving as a strengthening cross-member between the legs to enhance<br>
lateral stability of the undercarriage.<br>
The pair of frame members may conveniently be displaceable relative to each<br>
other between an operative condition in which the frame members lie in parallel planes<br>
which are laterally spaced apart in a direction transverse to the fore-and-aft direction of the<br>
shopping trolley a sufficient distance to permit temporary storage of articles of shopping<br>
in a space defined between the frame members, and a fully collapsed condition in which<br>
the frame members lie more or less flat against each other. It will be appreciated that the<br>
holder will typically be provided between the frame members, and the trolley will thus not<br>
be usable as a boot divider or organiser when it is in its fully collapsed condition.<br>
Advantageously, the trolley includes a pair of auxiliary wheels which are<br>
respectively mounted on the frame members adjacent ends of the frame members in the<br>
fore-and-aft direction of the trolley, such that the auxiliary wheels are engageable with the<br>
ground when the extendable legs are in their retracted positions and an end of the trolley<br>
opposite the auxiliary wheels is gripped by a user, to permit wheelbarrow-fashion operation<br>
of the trolley.<br>
The frame members and the legs may be of a polymeric plastics material,<br>
each component being an integral moulding. Instead, the components may be of an<br>
extruded metal, such as steel, aluminium, or titanium, or they may be of a composite fibre<br>
material, such as carbon fibre or KEVLAR.<br>
The invention also provides a vehicle which includes a body defining a boot,<br>
the boot having a securing arrangement specifically for securing a collapsible shopping<br>
trolley as defined above in a stable condition in the boot during normal operation of the<br>
vehicle, while the undercarriage of the shopping trolley is in its collapsed condition, the<br>
securing arrangement being for securing the shopping trolley such that the holder of the<br>
shopping trolley has an orientation relative to the vertical similar to its orientation when the<br>
undercarriage of the shopping trolley is in its erected condition and supports the holder on<br>
the ground.<br>
The securing arrangement may include a depression in a floor of the boot for<br>
receiving the shopping trolley with its undercarriage in its collapsed condition, the<br>
depression being complementary in outline to a bottom of the shopping trolley in its<br>
collapsed condition.   Instead, or in addition, the securing arrangement may include<br>
fastening means, such as straps, for fastening the trolley in position in the boot.<br>
The invention extends to a vehicle assembly which includes:<br>
a shopping trolley as defined above; and<br>
a vehicle as defined above, the shopping trolley being supported with its<br>
undercarriage in its collapsed condition on a floor of the boot of the vehicle and being<br>
secured in a stable condition by the securing arrangement provided by the vehicle.<br>
In cases where the construction of the shopping trolley comprises a pair of<br>
curved extendable legs, as defined above, the rear of the vehicle and the shopping trolley<br>
will be shaped for co-operation such that the trolley, when its legs are extended, can<br>
straddle the rear of the vehicle when a boot lid is open, to facilitate collapsing and erection<br>
of the undercarriage.<br>
The invention will now be further described, by way of example, with<br>
reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>

Figure 9 is a schematic side elevation of yet a further embodiment of a shopping<br>
trolley in accordance with the invention.<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally indicates a shopping trolley<br>
or vehicle accessory in accordance with the invention. The shopping trolley 10 comprises<br>
a holder in the form of a shopping basket or tray 12. The trolley 10 also includes an<br>
undercarriage 14.<br>
The tray 12 has a rectangular base 16 from which a low peripherally<br>
extending side wall 18 rises, to form a shallow storage space 20. The tray 12 is a moulded<br>
unit of a thermo-plastic material.<br>
The shopping trolley 10 includes a pair of durable bags 22,24 (not shown in<br>
Figure 2) which are snugly received in the storage space 20. The bags 22, 24 form a<br>
permanent part of the trolley 10, being removable or detachable from the tray 12 and being<br>
intended for repeated use. The bags 22,24 are of a woven flexible plastics textile material.<br>
One of the bags 22 is divided into four elongated cylindrical compartments 26 of equal<br>
size, the shape and size of the compartments 26 being suitable for holding conventional<br>
two litre cool drink bottles and the lengthwise direction of the compartments 26 being<br>
upright. The walls of this bag 22 are insulated, so that the bag 22 provides insulated<br>
storage compartments 26.<br>
The other bag 24 is divided into two chambers 28 of equal size. Each bag<br>
has a closure mechanism in the form of a slide fastener or zip 30, for openably closing the<br>
bags 22,24. Both bags 22,24 are substantially fluid-tight when they are closed. It should<br>
be appreciated that the size and shape of the storage chambers will vary from region to<br>
region or country to country to suit the preferences of users in the various regions where<br>
the trolleys 10 are used.<br>
Although not shown in the drawings, each bag 22, 24 is provided with a<br>
handle for facilitating carrying thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, which is not illustrated, the storage<br>
space 20 of the tray 12 is divided into compartments, so that the shopping trolley 10 does<br>
not include the bags 22, 24. In use, articles of shopping can be stored directly in these<br>
compartments of the tray 12.<br>
The undercarriage 14 is operable between an erected condition (Figure 1)<br>
in which the undercarriage 14 supports the tray 12 at a working height above the ground<br>
32 on a set of wheels 34, and a collapsed condition (Figures 2 and 3), in which the trolley<br>
10 is sufficiently compact to fit into a boot or trunk 50 (Figure 5) of a passenger sedan 52.<br>
In the erected condition (Figure 1) the undercarriage 14 thus supports the tray 12 at the<br>
usual shopping trolley height, i.e. about 0.6 metres or more from the ground 32, the<br>
storage space 20 of the tray 12 facing and opening upwardly.<br>
The undercarriage 14 comprises two independently erectable halves 36,<br>
each half 36 comprising a U-shaped handle frame 38 and a pair of wheel struts 40, each<br>
handle frame 38 being pivotally displaceable relative to the associated wheel strut 40 about<br>
a pivot axis 42 which is parallel to the base 16 of the tray 12, and extends normally to the<br>
fore-and-aft direction of the trolley 10. In the erected condition of the undercarriage 14, the<br>
handle frames 38 are pivotally spaced from the associated wheel struts 40, while, in the<br>
collapsed condition, each handle frame 38 lies flat against the associated wheel struts 40.<br>
It should be appreciated that although each handle frame 38 is aligned with an opposed<br>
pair of wheel struts 40 when the undercarriage is in its erected condition (Figure 1), this<br>
alignment is coincidental, and the handle frames 38 and wheel struts 40 could indeed be<br>
misaligned.<br>
In the erected condition, each handle frame 38 forms a handle 44 for<br>
facilitating pushing of the shopping trolley 10. Although not shown in detail, each wheel<br>
34 is in the form of a castor which is freely swivelable about an upright swivel axis, so that<br>
the trolley 10 can be pushed with equal ease from either end of the trolley 10. As the<br>
halves 36 of the undercarriage 14 are independently collapsible, the shopping trolley 10<br>
can be operated wheelbarrow-fashion when one of the halves 36 is erected and the other<br>
half 36 is collapsed. The undercarriage 14 is provided with a locking mechanism (not<br>
shown) for independently locking each half 36 in either an erected condition or a collapsed<br>
condition, to permit locking of the undercarriage in wheel-barrow format. In a development<br>
of the invention, the locking mechanism is operable by means of push buttons located on<br>
each of the handle frames 38. Furthermore, as can be seen in Figure 2, when the trolley<br>
10 is in its collapsed condition, the wheels 34 protrude from the rest of the undercarriage<br>
14 a sufficient distance to permit wheel-barrow-fashion operation of the trolley 10 when the<br>
undercarriage 14 is completely collapsed.<br>
Figure 4 shows a part of a floor 46 of the boot 50 of the passenger sedan 52,<br>
the shopping trolley 10 being supported on the floor 46 in its collapsed condition. As can<br>
be seen in Figures 4 and 5, the floor 46 has a securing formation in the form of a<br>
depression 48 which is complementary in outline to the underside of the shopping trolley<br>
10 in its collapsed condition, so that the shopping trolley 10 is snugly received in this<br>
depression 48. The shopping trolley 10 is thus held and located in a stable condition in the<br>
boot 50 during normal operation of the vehicle 52.<br>
In use, the shopping trolley 10 is stored in the boot 50 of the vehicle 52 during<br>
normal operation of the vehicle 52, the trolley 10 being held in a stable condition by the<br>
depression 48 in the floor 46 of the boot 50. In this condition, the shopping trolley 10<br>
serves as a boot divider, or trunk organizer, providing a number of compartments 26,28<br>
for storing goods in a stable manner.<br>
When a user (not shown) goes into a shop to do shopping, the shopping<br>
trolley 10 is removed from the boot, and the undercarriage 14 is displaced into its erected<br>
condition by pivotally displacing the handle frames 38 away from the wheel struts 40, the<br>
undercarriage 14 automatically locking in its erected condition. The shopping trolley 10 is<br>
then used in a manner similar to conventional shopping trolleys, by pushing the trolley 10<br>
to a shop where articles are to be bought, steering the trolley 10 between the aisles of the<br>
shop, and placing articles which are to be bought into the tray 12. After the articles of<br>
shopping have been checked out in the usual manner, the bought articles are placed in the<br>
bags 22,24 in the tray 12, and the trolley 10 is pushed back to the vehicle 52. Thereafter,<br>
the undercarriage 14 is collapsed, and the shopping trolley 10, with the bought articles still<br>
carried by the bags 22, 24 in the tray 12, is placed in the boot. Naturally, articles which<br>
should preferably be kept cool, are placed in the insulated chambers 26.<br>
It is envisaged that the undercarriage 14 can be constructed such that it is<br>
automatically collapsible upon pushing thereof into contact with the boot 50 of the vehicle<br>
52. To this end, it is expected possibly to be necessary to build the rear end of the vehicle<br>
52 specifically to form a landing for such an automatically collapsible shopping trolley,<br>
when a lid of the boot 50 is open. This landing can include a roller rotatably mounted on<br>
the vehicle, to facilitate sliding of the trolley into the boot 50.<br>
The user can then drive back to the user"s home, the trolley 10 being kept<br>
stable in the boot 50 as described above. At home, the user has the option of removing<br>
the trolley 10 from the boot, erecting the undercarriage 14, and pushing the trolley 10 to<br>
a desired location, or the user can remove the bags 22,24 and carry them to the desired<br>
location.<br>
In Figures 6-8, reference numeral 60 generally indicates a further<br>
embodiment of a shopping trolley in accordance with the invention, like reference numerals<br>
indicating like parts in Figures 1-5 and Figures 6-8. The shopping trolley 60 functions<br>
in a manner similar to the shopping trolley 10 of Figure 1 but has a different construction<br>
and is thus collapsible and extendable in a different manner.<br>
The shopping trolley 60 has two semi-circular or generally bow-shaped frame<br>
members 62 which lie in parallel planes and which are transversely spaced apart, said<br>
planes being parallel to the fore-and-aft direction of the trolley 60. A bow 64 of each frame<br>
member 62 is a hollow tube having a rectangular cross-section. The ends of each bow 64<br>
is connected together by a strut 66 for rigidity.<br>
An elongate curved leg 68 is received in each frame member 62, the leg 68<br>
having a radius of curvature equal to that of the bow 64 of the associated frame member<br>
62, and having a slightly smaller rectangular cross-section, so that each leg 68 is<br>
longitudinally telescopically slidable in the associated bow 64. Each leg 68 is thus<br>
displaceable between a retracted position (Figure 8) in which the leg 68 is fully received<br>
within the bow 64, and an extended position (Figures 6 and 7) in which the leg 68 projects<br>
from the frame member 62, being arranged more or less end-to-end with the associated<br>
bow 64. Although not shown, the trolley 60 has an automatic locking mechanism for<br>
automatically locking the legs 68 in their extended positions.<br>
Each leg 68 has mounted thereon two wheels 70 and a handle 72, the<br>
respective wheels 70 and the handle 72 being spaced apart along the length of the leg 68.<br>
As can best be seen in Figures 6 and 8, each of the wheels 70 and the handles 72 is<br>
mounted on the associated leg 68 by means of a mounting formation in the form of a<br>
mounting plate 74 which projects transversely from the leg 68 away from the associated<br>
frame member 62, i.e. radially away from leg 68. Each bow 64 has a longitudinally<br>
extending slot 76 in a radially outer wall thereof, so that the mounting plates 74 of each leg<br>
68 are longitudinally slidable along the associated slot 76 upon telescopic retraction or<br>
extension of the leg 68.<br>
Thus, when one of the legs 68 is fully extended (Figure 6), the pair of wheels<br>
70 mounted thereon projects downwardly from the body of the trolley 60 provided by the<br>
frame members 62, so that the legs 68 together form an undercarriage 14 for supporting<br>
the frame members 62 on the ground on wheels 70. In this position, the handles 72 are<br>
located at a rear 78 of the trolley 60 in the fore-and-aft direction thereof, for gripping by a<br>
user to push the trolley 60 along. However, when the legs 68 are in their retracted<br>
positions (Figure 8), the wheels 70 are located operatively above the bows 64, the handles<br>
72 being positioned adjacent a front 80 of the frame member 62, opposite the rear 78 of<br>
the trolley 60.<br>
Each handle 72 is pivotally mounted on its associated mounting plate 74 for<br>
pivoting about a pivot axis 82 which extends in a direction normal to the fore-and-aft<br>
direction of the trolley 60. Each handle 72 is thus displaceable between an operative<br>
position (Figures 6 and 7) in which it projects transversely, more or less radially from the<br>
associated frame member 62 for gripping by a user, and a stowed position (Figure 8) in<br>
which the handle 72 lies adjacent the bow 64 of the associated frame member 62,<br>
extending in a circumferential direction. As can be seen in Figure 8, the handles 72 are<br>
curved in a manner similar to the frame members 62, so that in its stowed position, each<br>
handle 72 hugs the curve of the associated bow 64. In this example, each handle 72 is<br>
about 0,4m long. Although not shown in the drawings, each handle 72 is provided with an<br>
associated automatic locking mechanism for automatically locking it in its operative<br>
position. In other embodiments of the invention, each handle can have a grip which<br>
projects transversely from an elongate curved main portion of the handle, the grip being<br>
located at an end of the handle remote from its pivotal connection to the associated leg 68,<br>
projecting in a direction away from the frame member 62.<br>
Similarly, each wheel 70 is mounted on the associated mounting plate 74 by<br>
means of a elongated foot 84. Each foot 84 is pivotally displaceable relative to the<br>
associated mounting plate 74 about an associated pivot axis 86 which extends in a<br>
direction normal to the fore-and-aft direction of the trolley 60. Each foot 84 is thus<br>
displaceable between an operative position (Figures 6 and 7) in which it projects<br>
transversely, i.e. radially, away from the associated leg 68 for engagement with the ground,<br>
and a stored position, in which it is pivoted towards the associated frame member 62, to<br>
lie adjacent and more or less parallel to a corresponding part of the associated bow 64,<br>
extending more or less circumferentially. As can be seen in Figure 8, the feet 84 of each<br>
leg 68 pivot in opposite directions towards their stored positions, towards each other, so<br>
that no part of the leg 68, the wheels 70, or the handle 72 projects in a circumferential<br>
direction beyond the ends of the bow 64 of the associated frame member 62. Although<br>
not shown in the drawings, each foot 84 is provided with an associated automatic locking<br>
mechanism for automatically locking in its operative position. Each wheel 70 is a multi-<br>
directional ball mounted on an end of the associated foot 84 opposite the pivot axis 86 of<br>
that foot 84, to provide multi-directional movement of the trolley 60.<br>
The radius of curvature of the bows 64 and the legs 68 is about 0,4 m, and<br>
the length of each foot 84 is about 150 mm. The length of the struts 66 is thus about 0,8<br>
m. Thus, when erected, the height of the tops of the bows 64 from the ground is about<br>
0,95 m, while the height of the struts 66, which define the height at which the bags 22,24<br>
are spaced from the ground, is about 0,55 m. When collapsed, the height and length of<br>
the trolley 60 are respectively somewhat more than 0,4 m.<br>
Each frame member 62 includes a side panel 88 which closes off a semi-<br>
circular opening defined by that frame member 62. Each side panel 88 also provides a<br>
longitudinally extending narrow tray 90 which is laterally spaced from the frame member<br>
62 for receiving miscellaneous articles such as pens or note pads.<br>
In the erected condition of the trolley 60, i.e. when both legs 68 are in their<br>
extended positions, there is defined a gap between the distal ends of the legs 68 and ends<br>
of the bows 64 at the front 80 of the trolley 60, so that the trolley 60 is shaped like a lower<br>
case letter e, when viewed in side view (best seen in Figure 9).<br>
A storage space defined between the frame members 62 houses a pair of<br>
flexible fabric bags 22, 24, similar to those described with reference to Figures 1 - 4, the<br>
bags 22,24 being shaped such that upper sides thereof follow the curvature of the frame<br>
members 62. The bags 22,24 are removable and replaceable, similar to the construction<br>
described with reference to Figures 1 - 4. The frame members 62 thus together define a<br>
holder for holding articles of shopping, via the bags 22, 24. The tops of the bags 22,24<br>
are generally curved, to follow the curvature of the bows 64, but the bags 22, 24 can be<br>
extended vertically to receive overflow items when required, similar to a pair of bags 102<br>
in Figure 9.<br>
The frame members 62 are laterally displaceable relative to each other, being<br>
connected together by a pair of laterally extending collapsible struts 92, one of the struts<br>
92 being located at the front 80 of the trolley 60 and the other strut 92 being located at the<br>
rear 78 of the trolley 60. The frame members 62 are thus displaceable between a fully<br>
collapsed condition of the trolley 60, in which the struts 92 are collapsed, being folded in<br>
articulated fashion, so that the parallel planes in which the- frame, members 62 lie are<br>
located adjacent each other, and an erected condition in which the frame members 62 are<br>
transversely spaced apart sufficiently to receive the bags 22,24 in an expanded condition<br>
therein. The fully collapsed condition of the trolley 60 is shown in Figure 8, the bags 22,<br>
24 and the side panels 88 having been removed for ease of illustration. It will be<br>
appreciated that the bags 22, 24 are indeed removable and can be removed in order to<br>
facilitate easy collapsing of the frame members 62. Each lateral strut 92 is about 0,4 m<br>
long when extended.<br>
The trolley 60 includes an auxiliary holder in the form of a tray 94 provided<br>
between the legs 68 when they are in their extended positions (Figures 6 and 7). The tray<br>
94 is removable and replaceable and is intended for the storage of bulky goods. In the<br>
example shown in Figures 6 and 7, the tray 94 comprises a flexible canvas base 96<br>
stretched between two cross-bars (not shown in Figures 6 and 7 but schematically<br>
indicated in Figure 9 by reference numeral 96), the cross-bars 96 being connected to both<br>
legs 68 to extend transversely between them. The cross-bars 96 thus function as<br>
stabilizers for enhancing lateral rigidity of the trolley 60 in its erected condition.<br>
In use, the trolley 60 is used in a manner similar to the trolley 10 described<br>
with reference to Figures 1 - 5. During normal use, the trolley 60 is located in the boot of<br>
a vehicle in a semi-collapsed condition (not shown). This semi-collapsed condition<br>
corresponds to the fully collapsed condition shown in Figure 8, except that the lateral struts<br>
92 are extended, so that the frame members 62 are laterally spaced apart sufficiently for<br>
the bags 22,24 to be expanded. In this condition, the struts 66 of the frame member 62<br>
provide a stable base on which the trolley 60 rests on the floor of the boot, so that the<br>
trolley 60 functions as a boot divider or organizer. In this condition the removable tray 94<br>
comprising the pair of cross-bars 96 and the canvas is folded up and is stored in the lateral<br>
tray 90 provided by one of the side panels 88. The trolley 60 is stored in the vehicle such<br>
that the fore-and-aft direction of the trolley 60 is aligned with the fore-and-aft direction of<br>
the vehicle.<br>
When the trolley 60 is to be removed from the boot, either at a shop, or at<br>
home, a user grips the bows 64 of the frame members 62 and pulls the trolley 60 towards<br>
an open end of the boot, such that the rear 78 of the trolley 60 projects beyond the rear of<br>
the vehicle, the frame members 62 still resting on the boot of the vehicle. The user then<br>
reaches over, grips the handles 72, and pulls them towards the open end of the boot, to<br>
slide the legs 68 along the bows 64, thus telescopically extending the legs 68. The legs<br>
68 thus move in a circumferential direction around the rear of the vehicle, such that the<br>
legs 68 project beneath the vehicle for engagement of the wheels 70 with the ground, the<br>
gap formed at the front 80 of the trolley 60 straddling the rear of the vehicle. The handles<br>
72 are pivoted away from the frame members 62 and automatically locked in position, after<br>
which the trolley 60 is withdrawn from the boot of the vehicle and is used for shopping in<br>
the manner described above with reference to the trolley 10 of Figures 1 - 5. After<br>
shopping has been completed, the process is reversed, to position the trolley 60 in the boot<br>
in its semi-collapsed condition. In other words, the trolley 60 is wheeled towards the boot<br>
of the vehicle (which is open), so that the gap at the front 80 of the trolley 60 straddles the<br>
rear of the vehicle, the frame members 62 resting on the boot, after which the legs 68 are<br>
telescopically retracted into the associated bows 64. It is envisaged that, in a development<br>
of the invention, the extension and/or retraction of the legs 68 can be automated, for<br>
instance being activated by a hydraulic, pneumatic, or electro-mechanical actuating means.<br>
Such an actuating means can for instance be powered by a standard battery of the vehicle.<br>
If more space in the boot is required, i.e. when no boot organizer is needed,<br>
the trolley 60 can be removed from its complementary depression (not shown) in the floor<br>
of the boot and the lateral struts 92 are collapsed to displace the frame members into a<br>
fully collapsed compact condition (Figure 8). In this fully collapsed condition, the trolley<br>
occupies less space than in its semi-collapsed condition.<br>
In Figure 9 of the drawings, reference numeral 100 generally indicates a<br>
further embodiment of a shopping trolley in accordance with the invention, like reference<br>
numerals indicating like parts in Figures 6-8 and in Figure 9. The shopping trolley 100<br>
functions in a manner largely similar to the shopping trolley 60 of Figures 6-8, with the<br>
main distinctions set out below.<br>
The shopping trolley 100 has a pair of bags 102 which have transparent<br>
plastics walls and rigid tray-like bases. Although not shown in the drawings, the bags 102<br>
have multi-purpose partitioned compartments and hook-and-loop type fasteners for closing<br>
separate lids for separate compartments defined by the bags 102. Each bag 102 also has<br>
a rigid handle for facilitating removal and handling of the bag 102.<br>
The trolley 100 is also provided with an auxiliary wheel 104 at an end of the<br>
strut 66 of each frame member 62 at the front 80 of the trolley 100. The auxiliary wheel<br>
104 is extendable to project operatively downwardly from the associated frame member<br>
62, to permit wheelbarrow-fashion operation of the trolley 100 when in its semi-collapsed<br>
condition, i.e. when the legs 68 are retracted, by gripping of the rear 78 of the trolley 100<br>
by an user. The auxiliary wheel 104 is shown in its extended position in shadow lines in<br>
Figure 9, and is mounted on a small leg which permits the scaling of stairs by the trolley<br>
100 when a user drags the trolley 100 wheelbarrow-fashion behind the user. Although not<br>
shown in the drawings, the lateral strut 92 at the rear 78 of the trolley 100 has handle<br>
openings for facilitating gripping of the trolley 100 during such wheelbarrow-fashion<br>
operation.<br>
Figure 9 also shows gripping openings 106 in the mounting plates 74 of the<br>
handles 72, to facilitate displacement of the legs 68 during extension or retraction of the<br>
legs 68. The handle 72 is also provided with a push button 108 for unlocking of the handle<br>
72 when it is in its operative position.<br>
The trolley 100 is furthermore provided with base strips 112 which extend<br>
along underneath surfaces of the struts 66 of the frame members 62, the base strips 112<br>
being of a material having a low coefficient of friction, such as TEFLON, to facilitate sliding<br>
of the trolley 100 into the boot of the vehicle, and also to protect the vehicle against<br>
damage during such sliding movement. The frame members 62 and the legs 68 are of a<br>
moulded thermo-plastics polymeric material.<br>
An additional feature of the trolley 100 of Figure 9, is that advertising material<br>
is provided on the laterally outwardly directed surface of the side panel 88.<br>
It is an advantage of a shopping trolley 10, 60, 100 as described with<br>
reference to the drawings, that it provides for convenient transportation of articles of<br>
shopping from a point of purchase to the home of the user. In contrast to conventional<br>
shopping methods, it is not necessary for the user to find a functioning shopping trolley at<br>
the shop, to pack the bought articles into thin-walled flexible plastic bags at the checkout<br>
point, to load these shopping bags into the boot of the vehicle, to unload the bags from the<br>
boot of the vehicle, and to carry them to the desired location. Consequently, at least the<br>
step of unloading shopping bags from a conventional shopping trolley into the boot of the<br>
vehicle is eliminated, and, if the shopping trolley 10,60,100 is used to convey the bought<br>
articles from the vehicle to the desired location, the step of unloading the shopping bags<br>
from the boot of the vehicle is also eliminated.<br>
The embodiments of the trolley 60,100 of Figures 6-9 has the additional<br>
advantage that erection and collapsing of the trolley 60,100 is facilitated by partial support<br>
of the trolley 60,100 on the vehicle during such erection or collapsing.<br>
Repeated use of the durable bags 22,24 should alleviate the environmental<br>
impact of conventional shopping bags of thin plastics sheet material.<br>
*<br>
The trolley 10,60,100 also provides a convenient way of transporting articles<br>
from the home to the shop, for instance empty bottles which are to be returned. When a<br>
small quantity of shopping is to be bought, a user has the option of removing one of the<br>
durable bags from the trolley 10,60,100, leaving the trolley 10,60,100 in the vehicle, and<br>
using the bag to carry articles of shopping from the shop to the vehicle, where the bag is<br>
returned to the trolley 10,60,100.<br>
It is, of course, a further advantage of the invention that, while not in use as<br>
a shopping trolley, the shopping trolley 10,60,100 conveniently provides a boot organizer.<br>
Also, the closure mechanisms 30 of the bags 22, 24 can prevent potential harm to<br>
occupants of a vehicle having no partition between the boot and the passenger<br>
compartment of the vehicle, owing to airborne articles of shopping during an accident.<br>
In a development of the invention, which is not shown, an electronic computer<br>
can be mounted on a mounting therefor provided on the trolley 10,60,100. The computer<br>
can be used to store a list of items to be bought, and it is envisaged that the computer can<br>
have an interface to a computer system of a shop where articles are to be bought, for<br>
downloading information about these articles, such as their price and their location in the<br>
shop. Naturally, the computer will be located in an easily accessible manner in the trolley<br>
10,60,100.<br>
The tray 12 or the frame members 62 can also be provided with hooks for<br>
holding additional shopping bags, and the tray 12 of the embodiment of Figures 1-4 can<br>
have integrally moulded handles for facilitating carrying or storage of the tray 12, e.g. for<br>
carrying thereof in the fashion of a suitcase or for manoeuvring it in a vehicle"s boot.<br>
It is also a feature of the invention that it can easily be made of recycled or<br>
recyclable materials; and that it can be branded and/or styled to match particular makes<br>
and/or colours of vehicles. This is particularly the case with the embodiments of Figures<br>
6-9, where advertising material or branding can be provided on the side panels 88.<br>
It is also expected that the invention can form a link between pantry and<br>
supermarket, while reducing the unnecessary use of disposable carrier bags. Instead, if<br>
desired, it can be left in the boot and its durable bags can be carried between it and the<br>
supermarket on the one hand, and between it and the pantry on the other.<br>
The reference numerals In clams ought not to be<br>
considered  as limiting scope of invention.<br>

articles of shopping, and a wheeled undercarriage (14) connected to the holder (62). The<br>
undercarriage (14) is operable between an erected condition, in which the undercarriage<br>
(14) supports the holder (62) at a working height above the ground on wheels (70), and a<br>
collapsed compact condition, for loading of the trolley (60) into a boot of a passenger<br>
sedan so that the holder (62) provides a boot organizer. In one embodiment of the<br>
invention, the undercarriage (14) comprises a pair of telescopically extendable curved<br>
legs (68) which have wheels (70) mounted thereon. The invention also extends to a<br>
vehicle which has a securing arrangement in its boot specifically for securing the<br>
collapsible shopping trolley (60) in a stable condition in the boot, when the undercarriage<br>
(14) of the trolley (60) is collapsed.</td>
