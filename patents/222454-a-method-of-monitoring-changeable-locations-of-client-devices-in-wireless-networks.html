				<td> Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to monitoring changeable locations of client devices in wireless networks. More particularly, it relates to security of computer networks, and deals more particularly with methods, systems, computer program products, and methods of doing business whereby access to a wireless network is controlled based on a device's presence within a spatial boundary. The disclosed techniques may also be used for determining whether devices remain within a spatial boundary.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
"WiFi" (for "wireless fidelity") or "Wi-Fi"Â® is the label commonly applied to devices following the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ("IEEE") 802.11b specification. This abbreviation is taken from the logo of an industry interoperability group (Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, Inc., or "WECA", also known as the Wi-Fi Alliance) that certifies compliant products. ("Wi-Fi" is a registered trademark of Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance, Inc.) WiFi technology allows a raw wireless data transmission rate of approximately 11 Mbps at indoor distances from several dozen to several hundred feet, and outdoor distances of several to tens of miles using an unlicensed portion of the 2.4 GHz band in 14 overlapped channels.<br>
While two modes of operation are possible, namely peer-to-peer and network, most WiFi installations use the network form where an "access point" serves as a hub bridging client adapters to one another and to a wired network, often using Network Address Translation ("NAT") technology. See FIG. 1, where this configuration is illustrated. When a client wants to join a network hosted by an access point, it must first synchronize with that network by performing the following synchronization protocol steps. First, to establish initial communications, it either listens for a "beacon" sent periodically by the access point or sends a "probe" and<br><br>
with that network by performing the following synchronization protocol steps.  First, to establish initial communications, it.either listens for, awaits a response. Next, the client undergoes an authentication process with the access point.  If that is successful, the client proceeds to anAMENDED SHEET<br>
association process which sets up a logical session over which higher-layer protocols and data may flow.  At any point thereafter, either the access point or the client may terminate the association, shutting down further data communications.  After the association is terminated, no further data communication can occur until the aforementioned synchronization protocol is repeated to join the network anew.<br>
The world of WiFi is no longer confined to expensive-gadget-happy geeks, but is being embraced by everyday people who love the convenience of being mobile.  Mass production has made access points and client adapters so inexpensive that WiFi is being widely used for networking in many places, including homes and small offices, replacing the high-cost special wiring of the past and allowing folks to easily move their computing workspace on a moment-to- moment whim.  As the majority of users purchasing commodity-priced WiFi gear are non- technical, they have no insight to the underlying technology nor do they understand the side effects of its use.<br>
Unfortunately, WiFi has also attracted the hacker fringe, who view its deployment as an invitation to steal access to the Internet and/or locally-available services.  The poor security which has been identified in WiFi's standard protocols (see, for example, "Wireless networks wide open to hackers" by Robert Lemos, which may be found on the Internet at http://news.com.com/2100- 1001-269853.html?tag=bplst ), coupled with cheap ways to intercept the radio signals miles outside the nominal 300 foot service radius (see "Antenna on the Cheap" by Rob Flickenger, located on the Internet at http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/weblog/view/wlg/448) has opened the barn door to even the lowly budget-strapped high school "script kiddy".  With this trend, new terms for wireless hacking have emerged, such as "War Driving" and "Warchalking".  War driving is the activity of locating WiFi networks that can easily be tapped from a laptop in a car. (See "WAR DRIVING" by Sandra Kay Miller, located on the Internet at http://www.infosecuritymag.com/articles/november01/technology_wardriving. s html, for an article on this topic.).  Warchalking is the practice of marking the presence of WiFi networks (for example, on the side of a building where a WiFi network is detected by a "war driver", or on the sidewalk in front of the building) so they are easy to locate without a device such as the 56.45 "Pringles" can antenna (described in the above-mentioned "Antenna on the Cheap" article) used by the war drivers.<br>
What is needed is a way of improving security in WiFi. networks to prevent intrusion by unauthorized devices.  The solution must be easy to<br>
set up, even in a home environment, and must not require changes to the WiFi standards or to existing client device adapters.<br>

part, will be obvious from the description or may be learned by practice<br>
of the invention.	<br>
To achieve the foregoing objects, and in accordance with the purpose of the invention as broadly described herein, the present invention provides methods, systems, and computer program products for monitoring a changeable location of one  or more client devices in a wireless network. . In a preferred embodiment, this technique comprises:  receiving, at a first device on the WLAN, measurement data from a plurality of measurement points on the WLAN, wherein the measurement data for each measurement point comprises a reading for a particular client device, the reading observed by a plurality of antenna elements of the measurement point, the antenna elements being capable of determining an angle to a source of radio transmission; computing, by the first device, a current location of the particular client device using the received measurement data;<br><br>
determining, by the first device, whether the current location of the particular client device is within a predetermined spatial boundary and performing desired action depending on the determined location of client device.<br>
This embodiment may further comprise allowing the particular client device to access the WLAN only if its current location is determined to be within the predetermined spatial boundary; deactivating one or more functions of the particular client device if its current location is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary; and/or activating an alarm if the current location of the particular client device is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary. The first device may periodically transmit a cryptographic key from the first device to the particular client device, the cryptographic key being required to unlock at least one of the functions of the particular client device, in which case the deactivation preferably further comprises ceasing the transmission when the current location of the particular client device is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary.<br>

The first device preferably learns the predetermined spatial boundary at set-up time, where this preferably comprises: moving a training client device around a spatial boundary while the training client device communicates with a set-up application in the first device; recording, by the set-up application, successive locations of the training client device from these communications; and using, by the set-up application, the successive locations to define the predetermined spatial boundary.<br>
The present invention may also be provided as a method whereby a service is offered to clients for determining whether their wireless devices are within, or remain within, a particular spatial boundary.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Security of wireless networks is improved by rejecting traffic from a wireless device located outside a defined spatial boundary.  The device's spatial position with respect to the boundary is determined using multiple directional antenna arrays and calculating where the vectors intersect. Problems of prior art approaches are solved by the present invention, which provides a novel application of existing technologies.<br>
Most client adapters in existing devices use omni-directional antennas.  However, in addition to the significant attenuation of the radio signal as it passes through intervening objects like walls and furniture, these so-called omni-directional antennas exhibit significant variations in gain patterns, i.e., they are not really omni-directional. Thus, the signal strength seen at a receiver is of no use in determining the distance to the transmitter.<br><br>
The present invention overcomes problems of the prior art using a modified WiFi access point (also called a "base station") and at least two remote wireless sensors, all participating in the WiFi network to be protected, and preferably deployed in an equilateral triangle configuration.  See Fig. 2.  These devices are referred to herein as "measurement points".  Each measurement point is equipped with a directional antenna capable of determining the angle to the source of radio transmissions.  By intersecting the directional vectors measured at each measurement point, the present invention determines the spatial position of devices attempting to access the network, and classifies them as being inside or outside a defined boundary.  See Fig. 3.  Devices inside the boundary are allowed to connect to the network (assuming, of course, that trie previously- discussed synchronization protocol completes successfully), while devices outside the boundary are not.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention use an antenna array at each measurement point to determine the angular direction of the client's transmission.  An "antenna array" is any prior-art arrangement of antenna elements capable of discerning the directionality of a radio signal.  (That is, the measurement point's directional antenna may be a single antenna comprised of multiple antenna elements in an array, or a plurality of antennas that are individually not directional but which are directional when used together as an array.)  In simple wireless networks such as a single-occupant house or an office building, two-element arrays at each measurement point may suffice to define a 2-dimensional boundary. For more complex arrangements where a 3-dimensional spatial boundary is needed, each measurement point can employ a multiple-element array to measure the angle of the received signals in 3 dimensions.<br>
The base station, upon receiving angular readings from each measurement point for a given association (i.e., for a given client session with the base station), computes the client's position with respect to a defined boundary.  If this position falls outside the defined boundary, the base station terminal; es the association, forcing the client to re-authenticate before it o-jn receive or send layer three data.  This process is described in more detail uelow, with reference to Fig. 6.<br>
Each measurement point J:, equipped with an antenna array that intercepts radio transmissions from client devices.  The processing of a client transmission at a measurement: point is illustrated by logic in Fig. 4.  Upon detecting a transmission (BLock 400), the measurement point preferably measures the angular relationship between the signal source and<br><br>
the antenna array (Block 410), decodes the WiFi packet to extract the client association identifier (Block 420), locates an appropriate slot in a buffer corresponding to the association (Block 430), and saves the angular value in that slot (Block 440). The angular relationship may be determined using suitable prior art techniques such as phase angle, which may be implemented using a digital signal processor or other suitable hardware/software combination.<br>
To prevent excessive communications overhead between the base station and the other measurement points and to reduce the base station's processing load, the measurement points preferably collect, sort, and reduce instantaneous readings over a short period, say a few seconds.  For every unique association seen in client transmissions, the measurement point then reports a single, most-recent angle for this association to the base station.  This reporting process is illustrated in Fig. 4, where Block 450 tests to see if the reporting is triggered.  (For example, when a timer is used to measure the preferably-short reporting period, Block 450 comprises determining whether the timer has popped.)  If so, then the measurement point transmits saved values for one or more associations to the base station (Block 460).  Alternatively, the processing of Blocks 450 and 460 may be separated from the processing of Blocks 400 - 440.  (For example, a separate thread may be used for implementing the reporting.) In this case, the reporting may occur independently of receiving a client transmission.<br>
The diagram in Fig. 5 depicts how angular measurements at two measurement points may suffice to narrow the spatial position of a transmission source to an intersection zone.  Depending on the type of antenna array employed, it may not be possible to know the precise angle. The phase angle method in preferred embodiments of the present invention can determine a vector (e.g., vector a), where the transmitter could be located at a degrees +/- some tolerance, with respect to an individual antenna array.  (Depending on the antenna array in use, the phase angle method might only be able to determine that the transmitter is either at a degrees, plus or minus some tolerance, or at a + 180 degrees, plus or minus the same tolerance.)  The intersection of these vectors from the two measurement points forms an "intersection zone", where this intersection zone indicates the transmitter's approximate position in a 2-dimensional space.<br>
To a define 2-dimensional planar boundary, e.g., using 3 measurement points, ideally the measurement points are positioned in an equilateral<br><br>
triangle with vertices near the defined boundary.  Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate a circular boundary using a dotted line.  In this example, the cell phone and laptop devices would be prevented from accessing the network, since they are outside the spatial boundary, but the pager device would be allowed access.  Preferably, each measurement point's antenna array is oriented approximately 60 degrees from the other two measurement points' antenna arrays.<br>
With less-than-ideal arrangements, the spatial tolerance becomes less precise.  The tolerance will vary with the angle to an antenna array and between the devices.  In preferred embodiments, each measurement point reports its observed angles as if they are perfect, i.e., having a zero tolerance; however, each measured angle is affected by the tolerance (i.e., variance) of its antenna.  In a typical implementation using mass-marketed antennas, the tolerance angle is likely a function of the type of antenna array, and thus may be defined as a constant or configurable value to be used by the base station when computing client positions.  Alternatively, an implementation may allow for the measurement points to transmit their tolerance angle to the base station, if it is known.  It should be noted that the tolerance angle need not be uniform among measurement points.  Instead, each measurement point simply needs a tolerance angle that is reasonable, i.e., not too large, and that is known by or available to the base station.<br>
To determine the transmitter's position in a 3-dimensional space (e.g., a suite within an office building), preferred embodiments use three measurement points and intersect three vectors.  A larger number of measurement points can be used, if desired.<br>
The remote measurement points are themselves WiFi clients and at regular short intervals transmit their measurement data (a list of association, angle pairs) to the base station. There are numerous ways to encode and to synchronize the transmissions from the remote measurement points, and the scope of the present invention is not limited by choice of a particular approach.  One approach that may be used will now be described with reference to logic in Fig. 6.<br>
On receiving measurement data from a remote measurement point (Block 600), the base station stores this data in a table or similar data structure (Block 610).  Recall that, in preferred embodiments, the base station itself hosts an additional measurement point, and thus locally-received input (which may be processed by the base station, in its role as<br><br>
a measurement point, using logic in Fig. 4) is also stored in this table. (Alternatively, an additional remote measurement point might replace the base station in its role of observing and reporting device locations, without deviating from the scope of the present invention.)  Preferably, the rows of the table correspond to client associations observed during a measurement interval.  The first column contains the association identifier.  Additional columns correspond to each measurement point.  See Fig. 1, where a sample table is illustrated.  In this sample table 700, the association identifier is stored in column 705, the data observed by the base station itself is stored in column 710, and data reported by two remote measurement points ("MP1" and "MP2") is stored in columns 715 and 720, respectively.  Additional columns may be added for implementations using more than three measurement points.<br>
Returning to the discussion of Fig. 6, the base station checks (Block 620) to see if it is time to process the table entries.  If not, control returns to Block 600 to await input from another measurement point. Otherwise, Block 630 processes this table to determine each client's position.  Block 640 compares the client position to the defined boundary, and if the client is outside the boundary, this association is terminated (Block 650).  In either case, control preferably returns to Block 600.<br>
In one aspect, the test in Block 620 is timer-driven.  For example, a collection interval may be defined, and the table entries that have been collected during this interval are then processed when the collection interval expires.  One way in which this aspect may be implemented is illustrated by logic in Fig. 8.  Upon receipt of data from a measurement point, a time stamp is preferably associated with the data as it is recorded in an augmented version of the table of Fig. 7 (Block 610' ). This time stamp may be the arrival time at the base station, or in alternative implementations it may be a time stamp reported by the measurement point.  (In the latter case, a reliable clock-synchronizing algorithm is preferably used to synchronize the clocks of the various measurement points.  Clock-synchronizing algorithms are known in the art, and do not form part of the inventive concepts of the present invention.)<br>
Block 620' comprises checking to see if more than one measurement point (including the base station) has reported data during the current collection interval .  The collection interval is preferably a predefined constant (or a configurable parameter), and should be small enough so that if a client is mobile (e.g., in a car or being carried by a person,', it cannot have travelled very far during the interval.  The collection<br><br>
interval should also be greater than or equal to the reporting interval used by the measurement points, so that if the measurement points report at different times, data from multiple measurement points will be available within a single collection interval.  Thus, if the test in Block 620' has a negative result, control returns to Block 600 of Fig. 6 to await measurements from other measurement points within this collection interval.  When data is available from multiple measurement points for this collection interval, on the other hand, Block 800 locates all such data (and may remove stale entries from the table, or may simply discard any measurements that fall outside the current interval), and this data is used in Block 630 of Fig. 6 when computing the client's position.<br>
In another aspect, the test in Block 620 and the subsequent table-processing logic may be separated from the receipt of measurement data in Block 600, such that the determination of whether the table should be processed is independent of receiving new input data.  In one approach within this aspect, the test in Block 620 has a positive result upon expiration of a timer (which preferably coincides with the collection interval).  As another approach, a continuous looping process may be used. In this case, the test in Block 620 has a positive result when a measurement point has reported new data (and at least one other measurement is available).<br>
In a further aspect, a demand-driven protocol may be used, whereby the base station periodically polls the measurement points for their input on a particular association.  The logic in Fig. 6 may then be used for processing the responses from the measurement points.  In this aspect, the test in Block 620 preferably comprises determining whether each polled measurement point has reported its data.<br>
A key advantage of the present invention is ease of setup.  When deploying the system, there is no need to precisely position the measurement points.  They are simply placed at approximately equal angles near the defined boundary, with each measurement point's directional antenna aimed toward the center of the protected area.  Setup can be accomplished with very simple instructions that almost anyone can follow, even if they have very little (or no) technical expertise.<br>
Preferably, the defined boundary is learned at set-up time by carrying a client device around the intended boundary while communicating with a set-up application in the base station.  With the remote reporting interval having been set to a very small value, the base station learns<br><br>
the angular coordinates of the boundary with respect to the measurement points, but need not know the actual dimensions involved (since it does not know the scale of distance involved).  Setting the reporting interval to a larger or smaller value (and/or altering the speed of movement of the client device) during this set-up process allows a base station to learn a boundary at a different level of granularity.<br>
Prior art software approaches are known which attempt to use relative signal strength triangulation to locate wireless local area network ("WLAN") clients.  As one example, the Positioning Engine from Ekahau, Inc. is a commercially-available product that may be used for tracking device locations in a WLAN.  While this product offers a number of advantages, because of signal attenuation and device transmission characteristics, extensive mapping of the entire area of coverage may be needed to produce highly-accurate results.  (Accurate results require using client adapters whose relative characteristics to the device used in the mapping are known.  That is, the transmitted power or effective radiated power from the attached or built-in antenna, at various angles, must be known, since this approach relies on signal strength.)  This approach also needs multiple full-wired access points (at least three), and changing the content of the area monitored (for example, moving furniture around) requires a recalibration.  For each interior mapped point, location coordinates are needed to pair with the signal strength readings.<br>
The present invention uses a different approach, as described in detail above.  It. does not rely on signal strength and hence on client adapter/antenna characteristics.  The present invention is not impacted by the content (e.g., furniture, walls, books, etc.) of the monitored area or changes to that content.  The training process used in preferred embodiments comprises simply walking the boundary, without needing to tell the system where the moving device is at each measurement.  The remote sensing device uses the WLAN to report readings, and therefore does not need multiple access points.<br>
The present: invention has been described with reference to its use in determining whether mobile devices are inside or outside a spatial boundary.  However, this is for purposes of illustration and not of limitation.  The inventive techniques described herein may be used for devices that are stationary devices as well (including a mobile device that has become stationary).  The present invention may also be used to ensure that one or more devices remain within a defined spatial boundary.<br><br>
For example, a theft-prevention system may be implemented in an office setting, retail store, warehouse, etc. using techniques disclosed herein. Suppose that an electronics store wishes to prevent thefts of relatively-expensive wireless gadgets.  The devices can be defined as participants in a WLAN.  An enumerated list of these devices can be created, and a system using techniques disclosed herein can then test for the devices on this list remaining within the defined boundary (e.g., the showroom and/or stockroom).  If a device that is supposed to be within the store moves outside the boundary, instead of rejecting its participation in the wireless network (as described above with reference to Blocks 640 and 650 of Fig. 6), the base station might activate an audible alarm or perhaps send a signal to the device to cause it to sound its own alarm, flash lights, etc.  Similarly, the continued presence of wireless devices at a museum, trade show, hotel, office, or other business location can be monitored in the same manner.  Guests can therefore use the devices while visiting the premises, but are effectively discouraged from removing the devices from that location.<br>
Another application of the disclosed techniques is to disable the functionality of a wireless device if the device crosses a defined boundary.  For example, a cryptographic key might be transmitted from the base station to a wireless device periodically, allowing the device to "unlock" its software and render that software usable.  If the device moves outside the boundary, the base station ceases transmitting the key. The device may then continue to work from an electrical standpoint, but the absence of the key causes the software to just stop working.<br>
These and other applications are within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The present invention may be provided as method(s) of doing business. For example, a business entity may provide a service that monitors the location of devices using techniques disclosed herein.  This service may be provided under various revenue models, such as pay-per- use billing, monthly or other periodic billing, and so forth.<br>
While preferred embodiments have been described with reference to radio-based wireless (i.e., WiFi or 802.lib) networks, this is for purposes of illustration but not of limitation; the disclosed techniques may be applied to other types of wireless networks as well.<br><br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A method of monitoring a changeable location of one or more client<br>
devices (110-120) in a wireless local area network ("WLAN"), comprising<br>
steps of:<br>
moving a training client device on the WLAN around a spatial boundary while the training client device communicates with a set-up application in a first device on the WLAN;<br>
recording, by the set-up application, successive locations of the training client device from these communications;<br>
using, by the set-up application, the successive locations to define the predetermined spatial boundary, wherein the first device learns the predetermined spatial boundary, wherein the first device learns the predetermined spatial boundary at set-up time;<br>
receiving, at a first device on the WLAN, measurement data from a plurality of measurement points on the WLAN, wherein the measurement data for each measurement point comprises a reading for a particular client device (110-120), the reading observed by a plurality of antenna elements of the measurement point, the antenna elements being capable of determining an angle to a source of radio transmission;<br>
computing, by the first device, a current location of the particular client device (110-120) using the received measurement data;<br>
determining, by the first device, whether the current location of the particular client device (110-120) is within the predetermined spatial boundary; and<br>
performing desired action depending on the determined location of said client device<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing desired action comprises the step of allowing the particular client device to access the WLAN only if its current location is determined to be within the predetermined spatial boundary.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing desired action comprises the step of deactivating one or more functions of the particular client device if its current location is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary.<br><br>
4 .   The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the step of performing desired action comprises the first device periodically transmitting a cryptographic key from the first device to the particular client device, the cryptographic key being required to unlock at least one of the functions of the particular client device, and wherein the deactivating step further comprises the step of ceasing the transmission when the current location of the particular client device is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing desired action comprises the step of activating an alarm if the current location of the particular client device is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary.<br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the step of performing desired action comprises the steps of:<br>
maintaining an enumeration of a plurality of client devices that should be present in the WLAN;<br>
performing the receiving, computing, and determining steps for each of the plurality of client devices; and<br>
if the current location of any of the client devices is determined not to be within the predetermined spatial boundary, activating an alarm or deactivating one or more functions of such devices.<br></td>
