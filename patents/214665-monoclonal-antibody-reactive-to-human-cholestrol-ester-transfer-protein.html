				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to hybridoma producing<br>
monoclonal antibody reactive to human cholesterol ester<br>
transfer protein(CETP), monoclonal antibody and its fragment<br>
reactive to human CETP, immobilized monoclonal antibody and<br>
immobilized antibody fragment, labeled monoclonal antibody and<br>
labeled antibody fragment, a kit for detection, assay,<br>
separation or purification of human CETP, a method for<br>
detection, assay, separation and purification of human CETP<br>
and a pharmaceutical composition containing said monoclonal<br>
antibody or said antibody fragment. This application is divided<br>
out of Indian application no.782/Cal/96.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are three types of cholesterol, free type, long<br>
chain fatty acid type and ester type, in all the tissues and<br>
blood plasma in organisms. The former two play important role<br>
in consisting of cell membrane. The latter is physiologically<br>
inactive and is mainly existing as a storage form. The<br>
cholesterols are derived from ingestion at small intestine or<br>
from biosynthesis at various tissues, especially at liver.<br>
Most of the cholesterols are derived from biosynthesis at<br>
liver.<br>
Free cholesterol biosynthesized and secreted from liver<br>
is incorporated in very low density lipoprotein(VLDL). Then,<br>
by the actions of lipoprotein lipase(LPL) and hepatic<br>
triglyceride lipase(HTGL), it is metabolized to low density<br>
1A<br>
lipoprotein (LDL) through intermediate density lipoprotein<br>
(IDL). By incorporation of LDL into peripheral cells through<br>
LDL receptor, free cholesterol is supplied to cells.<br>
There is a pathway from peripheral cells to liver called<br>
cholesterol reverse transfer system which is reverse direction<br>
of the way from liver to peripheral cells as mentioned above.<br>
Surplus free cholesterol supplied in peripheral cells from<br>
liver is drawn by high density lipoprotein (HDL) in blood.<br>
Then, by the action of lecithin cholesterol acyl<br>
transferase (LCAT), it is converted to cholesterol ester and is<br>
stored in high density lipoprotein (HDL) in blood. By the<br>
action of cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP), the<br>
cholesterol ester stored in HDL is transferred to VLDL, IDL or<br>
LDL in blood. By incorporation of VLDL, IDL or LDL having<br>
cholesterol ester into liver through LDL receptor, cholesterol<br>
is indirectly transferred to liver.<br>
Recently, the reverse cholesterol transfer system draws<br>
much attention as a mechanism to prevent atherosclerosis by<br>
preventing peripheral cells from accumulation of cholesterol.<br>
In fact, as for HDL which plays important role in the reverse<br>
cholesterol transfer system, many epidemiological surveys show<br>
that decrease of cholesterol ester in blood HDL is one of the<br>
risk factors of coronary artery disorders. It is now well<br>
recognized that HDL is a lipoprotein having anti<br>
atherosclerosis action.<br>
In addition to the importance of blood HDL, it becomes<br>
recognized that CETP is also important because it mediates<br>
transfer of cholesterol ester in HDL into blood LDL.<br>
Therefore, it becomes an urgent matter to elucidate<br>
relationship between CETP and various diseases such as CETP<br>
deficiency, hyperlipemia, hyperalphalipoproteinemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia, hypolipemia, atherosclerosis, diabetes<br>
and nephrotic syndrome.<br>
For instance, it is demonstrated experimentally that<br>
several times higher levels of CETP are secreted in blood of<br>
the patients with hyperlipemia compared to that of the healthy<br>
volunteers. On the other hand, CETP, HDL-cholesterol and<br>
atherosclerosis have the following relationship. When low<br>
CETP activity hardly causes atherosclerosis, but with high<br>
level of HDL cholesterol. In contrast, when high CETP<br>
activity causes atherosclerosis and with low level of HDL<br>
cholesterol. Such relationship is experimentally<br>
demonstrated(Current Therapy, vol. 7, 9:36-45(1989)).<br>
In order to elucidate the relationship, assay methods for<br>
CETP in body fluid such as blood plasma from healthy person or<br>
patient having the above various diseases, especially<br>
immunoassays such as radio immunoassay(RIA) by using<br>
monoclonal antibody against CETP(anti-CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody), or enzyme immunoassay(EIA, ELISA) is being<br>
developed together with anti-CETP monoclonal antibody for the<br>
assay methods.<br>
As to EIA(ELISA) assay with the anti-CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody, for examples, Imai et al.(Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
publication NO.HEI6-169793), Nakano, et al.,(Arteriosclerosis,<br>
vol. 19, 11:951, No. 22, (1991)), Takahama, et<br>
al.(Arteriosclerosis, vol. 20, 10:837, No. 135, (1992)), Sato,<br>
et al.(Arteriosclerosis, vol. 20, 10:836, No. 134, (1992)), H.<br>
Mezdur, et al.(Clinical Chemistry, vol. 40, 4:593-597(1994))<br>
Clark et al.(Journal of Lipid Research, vol. 36,:876(1995))<br>
reported sandwich ELISA method by using two kinds of anti-CETP<br>
monoclonal antibodies or their Fab".<br>
However, these assay methods requires complicated<br>
handling. Before assay, plasma sample has to be heat-treated<br>
at 95-100°C and/or pre-treated with a detergent such as Tween-<br>
20 and Triton X-100. As heat treatment, of plasma sample<br>
causes denaturation of CETP in the sample, the assay result<br>
tells only the amount of denatured CETP. So, it is impossible<br>
to assay intact CETP in plasma sample accurately.<br>
Also, R. Clark et al.(FASEB Journal, vol. 8, 7:A1343 No.<br>
495(1994)), Takahashi et al.(Arteriosclerosis, vol. 20, 10:837<br>
No. 136(1992) and ibid. vol. 21, 3:209 No. 97(1993)), Kanamitu<br>
et al.(ibid. vol. 21, 3:209 No. 98(1993)), Waki et al.(ibid.<br>
vol. 22, 5:441 No. 194(1994)) reported the assay results on<br>
CETP in plasma samples by ELISA, however, they did not<br>
described in detail preparation methods and properties of<br>
anti-CETP antibodies and specific assay procedures.<br>
Regarding RIA assay methods with the anti-CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody, Fukazawa et al.(Study on lipid biochemistry, vol.<br>
34:163-166(1992)), Y. Marcel et al.(J. Clin. Invest., vol.<br>
85:10-17(1990) and Adv. Exp. Med. Biol., vol. 243:225-<br>
230(1988)), Fukazawa et al.(J. Biochem., vol. 111:696-<br>
698(1992)), J.Koizumi et al.(Atherosclerosis, 90:189-<br>
196(1991), M. Brown et al. (Nature, vol. 342:448-451(1989)-) and<br>
V. Dangremont et al.(Clinica Chimica Acta, vol. 231:147-<br>
160(1994)) published reports.<br>
However, these RIA methods also had defects as EIA(ELISA)<br>
methods had. The defects were complexity of handling (the<br>
methods required pre-treatment of plasma sample with a<br>
detergent) and/or insufficient sensitivity for detection.<br>
As described above, many researchers tried to establish<br>
assay method for CETP- However, there is no report that such<br>
a convenient and sensitive system which needs no pretreatment<br>
of a sample and enables to determine conveniently the amount<br>
of intact CETP was established.<br>
To elucidate relationship between the diseases (such as<br>
atherosclerosis, hyperlipemia and hyper high density<br>
lipoproteinemia) and CETP that plays important role in the<br>
cholesterol reverse transfer system which may be highly<br>
related to the onset of the diseases, it is strongly requested<br>
to develop a simple and sensitive assay method that can be<br>
widely applicable to clinical purposes to assay intact CETP in<br>
body fluid including blood plasma from healthy person or any<br>
patient, and to develop monoclonal antibody used for said<br>
assay method. However, they have not been established yet.<br>
The present invention provides an assay method widely<br>
applicable for clinical purposes and the anti-human CETP<br>
monoclonal antibody which is very useful not only for said<br>
assay method but also as a reagent for separation/purification<br>
of CETP and for a pharmaceutical composition.<br>

By clarifying the meanings of the terms used here, the<br>
present invention is explained in detail.<br>
"A monoclonal antibody" of the present invention means a<br>
monoclonal antibody reactive to human CETP and more<br>
specifically, monoclonal antibody having at least the<br>
following characteristics (a), (b) and (c).<br>
(a) Reactive to plasma CETP (Cholesterol Ester Transfer<br>
Protein) of healthy human, hyperlipemia patients,<br>
LCAT(Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase) deficiency<br>
patients or hyper HDL(high density lipoprotein) patients.<br>
(b) Not reactive to rabbit CETP at the concentration of 3<br>
µg/ml or below.<br>
(c) Not specifically reactive to denatured human CETP.<br>
In addition, the monoclonal antibody of the present<br>
invention has a characteristic that it is reactive to intact<br>
CETP in human body fluid.<br>
"Denatured human CETP" mentioned here means human CETP of<br>
which higher-order structure(conformation) of protein has<br>
destroyed due to such as heat treatment or treatment with<br>
detergent(Tween-20, Triton X-100 etc.), or which is<br>
biologically inactive.<br>
More specifically, "monoclonal antibody" means the<br>
monoclonal antibodies #72-1 and #86-2 derived from the<br>
hybridomas #72-1 and #86-2 identified by Accession Number FERM<br><br>
BP-4944 and FERM BP-4945 respectively, and the monoclonal<br>
antibody #176-1 produced from the hybridoma #17 6-1 prepared in<br>
the example described below.<br>
Furthermore, it includes a recombinant chimeric<br>
monoclonal antibody, a recombinant humanized monoclonal<br>
antibody which can be prepared by genetic recombination,<br>
derived from said monoclonal antibody, and also includes human<br>
monoclonal antibody.<br>
The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention(for<br>
example, #72-1, #86-2 and #176-1) can be prepared by<br>
conventional preparation methods established for monoclonal<br>
antibodies. For instance, they can be produced from<br>
hybridomas prepared by cell fusion. That is, by immunizing<br>
mammals with antigen, antibody producing cells can be<br>
obtained. Hybridoma cells are prepared with said antibody<br>
producing cells and myeloma cells which does not have ability<br>
to produce autoantibody. After cloning of said hybridoma, a<br>
clone which produces monoclonal antibody showing specific<br>
affinity to the antigen used for immunization of the mammals<br>
is selected and then, the monoclonal antibody of the present<br>
invention is produced from the hybridoma.<br>
Specifically, non-denatured, intact, and biologically<br>
active purified human CETP is used as an antigen. Mammal<br>
(including transgenic animals such as genetically engineered<br>
mouse which produces human antibody), more specifically,<br>
mouse, rat, hamster or guinea pig, is immunized with said<br>
antigen by injecting said antigen once to several times<br>
subcuteneously, intramuscularly, intravenously, into food pad<br>
or intraperitoneally.<br><br>
In general, immunization is performed once to four times<br>
every one to fourteen days from the initial immunization.<br>
Antibody producing cells are obtained from said immunized<br>
mammal approximately one to five days after the final<br>
immunization.<br>
The hybridoma which secretes monoclonal antibody can be<br>
prepared according to the method by Kohler, and Milstein et<br>
al.(Nature, vol. 256:495-497(1975)) or according to modified<br>
method similar to the original method. Hybridoma is prepared<br>
by cell fusion of antibody producing cells and myeloma cells.<br>
The antibody producing cells are contained in spleen, lymph<br>
node, bone marrow or tonsil, preferably in spleen, which is<br>
obtained from the mammals immunized according to the above<br>
mentioned procedures. The myeloma cells incapable of<br>
producing autoantibody are derived from mammals preferably<br>
from mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit or human, more<br>
preferably from mouse, rat or human.<br>
As myeloma cells to be used for cell fusion, for example,<br>
mouse derived myeloma P3/X63-AG8..653(653), P3/NSl/l-Ag4-l(NS-<br>
1), P3/X63-Ag8.Ul(P3Ul), SP2/O-Agl4(Sp2/O, Sp2), PAI, FO or<br>
BW5147, rat derived myeloma 210RCY3-Ag.2.3., human derived<br>
myeloma U-266AR1, GM1500-6TG-A1-2, UC729-6, CEM-AGR, D1R11 or<br>
CEM-T15 and so forth can be used.<br>
Screening of hybridoma can be performed by culturing the<br>
hybridoma on microtiter plate as an example, then, by<br>
measuring reactivity of the culture supernatant of the well<br>
which shows proliferation to purified human CETP used for the<br>
immunization of mammals by ria or by enzyme immunoassay such<br>
as ELISA.<br><br>
Preparation of monoclonal antibody from hybridoma is<br>
performed by culturing the hybridoma in vitro or by placing<br>
the hybridoma in vivo in ascites of mouse, rat, guinea pig,<br>
hamster or rabbit, preferably in ascites of mouse or rat, more<br>
preferably in ascites of mouse, and then, by isolating<br>
monoclonal antibody from the culture supernatant or from the<br>
ascites of mammals.<br>
In case of culturing hybridoma in vitro, depending on the<br>
characteristics of cells, purpose of study, culturing method<br>
and so forth, known nutrient media or any kind of nutrient<br>
media modified from known basic media can be used as long as<br>
the media is usable to proliferate, maintain and keep the<br>
hybridoma and to produce monoclonal antibody in culture<br>
supernatant.<br>
As a basic media, for example, low calcium media such as<br>
Ham"Fl2 media, MCDB153 media and low calcium MEM media and<br>
high calcium media such as MCDB104 media, MEM media, D-MEM<br>
media, RPMI1640 media, ASF104 media or RD media can be<br>
applied. Depending on purpose of culture, said basic media<br>
may contain, for example, serum, hormones, cytokines and/or<br>
various inorganic or organic substances.<br>
Isolation and purification of the monoclonal antibody<br>
from the above mentioned culture supernatant or ascites can be<br>
performed by applying to saturated ammonium sulfate<br>
precipitation, euglobulin precipitation, caproic acid method,<br>
caprylic acid method, ion exchange chromatography(DEAE, DE52<br>
or the like), affinity column chromatography such as anti-<br>
immunoglobulin column chromatography and protein A column<br>
chromatography, and so forth.<br><br>
"Recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody" of the present<br>
invention means genetically engineered monoclonal antibody,<br>
specifically chimeric monoclonal antibody such as recombinant<br>
mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody characterized by its<br>
variable region derived from that of the above mentioned<br>
monoclonal antibody such as the monoclonal antibody #72-1,<br>
#86-2 or #176-1 and its constant region derived from that of<br>
human immunoglobulin. The constant regions derived from human<br>
immunoglobulins have different proper amino acid sequences<br>
based on their isotype such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE.<br>
The constant region of human immunoglobulin of any isotype can<br>
be applicable to the constant region of the recombinant<br>
chimeric monoclonal antibody of the present invention. The<br>
constant region of IgG is preferable.<br>
Recombinant mouse/human chimeric monoclonal antibody<br>
derived from the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1<br>
included in the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention<br>
can be prepared as follows, however, it is not limited to the<br>
following preparation method.<br>
The recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody can be<br>
prepared by, for example, referring Experimental<br>
Medicine (special edition) vol. 1-6, No. 10, 1988 and Japanese<br>
patent publication No. HEI 3-73280. At the downstream of the<br>
active VH gene(rearranged VDJ gene encoding variable region of<br>
H chain), the CH gene(C gene encoding constant region of H<br>
chain) is operably linked to, and at the downstream of the<br>
active VL gene(rearranged VJ gene encoding variable region of<br>
L chain), the CL gene(C gene encoding constant region of L<br>
chain) is operably linked to. These genes are inserted in<br><br>
same or different expression vector. The vh gene used here is<br>
obtained from DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-<br>
2 or #176-1 isolated from the hybridoma #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1<br>
of the present invention. The CH gene and the CL gene are<br>
obtained from DNA encoding human immunoglobulin. The VL gene<br>
is obtained from DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody #72-1,<br>
#86-2 or #176-1 isolated from the hybridoma #72-1, #86-2 or<br>
#176-1 of the present invention. Host cells are transformed<br>
with said vector(s). The recombinant mouse/human chimeric<br>
monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be prepared<br>
by culturing said transformed cells. As a host cell,<br>
prokaryotic cells (e.g. E. coli) or eukaryotic cells (e.g. CHO<br>
cell) can be used.<br>
Briefly, after DNA is extracted from the hybridomas #72-<br>
1, #86-2 or #176-1 by a conventional method, said DNA is<br>
digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme such as EcoRI<br>
and ffindlll. Then, southern blotting is performed by electro-<br>
phoresis (for example, with 0.7% agarose gel). After the<br>
electrophoresis, the gel is stained(for example, with etidium<br>
bromide). After taking photograph of the gel, location of<br>
marker is marked and the gel is washed twice, then, the gel is<br>
immersed in 0.25 M HC1 solution for 15 minutes. Then the gel<br>
is immersed in 0.4 N NaOH for 10 minutes with gentle shaking.<br>
By a conventional method, the gel is transferred on a filter<br>
and after 4 hours standing, the filter is recovered and is<br>
washed twice with 2 x SSC. After drying the filter<br>
completely, baking filter is performed at 75°C for 3 hours.<br>
After the baking, said filter is put in 0.1 x SSC/0.1 % SDS<br>
solution and is treated for 30 minutes at 65°C. The filter is<br><br>
immersed in 3 x SSC/0.1 % SDS solution. Then, the filter is<br>
put in a vinyl bag with the pre-hybridization solution and<br>
stand for 3 to 4 hours at 65°C.<br>
Then, 32p labeled probe DNA and the hybridization<br>
solution are added, and the mixture is reacted for<br>
approximately 12 hours at 65°C. After hybridization, the<br>
filter is washed at appropriate salt concentration, reaction<br>
temperature and time period(as an example, with 2 x SSC-0.1 %<br>
SDS solution, at room temperature for 10 minutes). Said<br>
filter is then put in a vinyl bag and small amount of 2 x SSC<br>
is added, the bag is closed tightly and autoradiography is<br>
performed.<br>
By the above-mentioned southern blotting, the rearranged<br>
VDJ gene and VJ gene which respectively encode H chain and L<br>
chain of the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1 are<br>
identified. The region including the identified DNA fragment<br>
is fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and<br>
incorporated into phage vector(such as Charon 4A, Charon 28,<br>
X.EMBL3 and XEMBL4). By transforming E. coli(such as LE392 and<br>
NM539) with said phage vector, genome library is established.<br>
By plaque hybridization with an appropriate probe(such as H<br>
chain J gene and L chain(k) J gene) according to Benton-Davis<br>
method(Science, vol. 196, p.180-182, 1977), positive clones<br>
containing rearranged VDJ gene or VJ gene respectively are<br>
obtained from the genome library. On the obtained clones, the<br>
restriction enzyme map is made, the nucleotide sequence is<br>
determined and existence of the rearranged VH(VDJ) gene or<br>
VL(VJ) gene is confirmed.<br><br>
On the other hand, human CH gene and human CL gene used<br>
for chimerization are isolated separately. For instance, to<br>
prepare chimeric antibody with human IgGl, C?l gene(CH gene)<br>
and Ck gene(CL gene) are isolated. These genes can be<br>
isolated from human genome library by using mouse C?l<br>
gene(corresponds to human C?l gene) and mouse Ck<br>
gene(corresponds to human Ck gene) as probes because the<br>
nucleotide sequences of mouse immunoglobulin gene and human<br>
immunoglobulin gene are highly homologous.<br>
Briefly, as an example, a DNA fragment containing human<br>
Ck gene and the enhancer region can be isolated from HaeIII-<br>
Alul genome library of the XCharon 4A (Cell, vol. 15:1157-<br>
1174(1978)) by using HindIII-BamHI fragment(3 kb) obtained<br>
from the clone Igl46(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 75:4709-<br>
4713(1978) and EcoRI fragment(6.8 kb) obtained from the clone<br>
MEPlO(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 78:474-478(1981)) as<br>
probes. The human C?l gene can be isolated by, for example,<br>
digesting DNA from human fetal liver cell with Hindlll,<br>
fractionating by agarose gel electrophoresis, inserting 5.9 kb<br>
band into X788 and then isolating with the above mentioned<br>
probes.<br>
Using the isolated a mouse VH gene, mouse VL gene, human<br>
CH gene and human CL gene, and considering the promoter region<br>
and the enhancer region, human CH gene is placed at the<br>
downstream of mouse VH gene and human CL gene is placed at the<br>
downstream of mouse VL gene in a expression vector such as<br>
pSV2gpt and pSV2neo by using an appropriate restriction enzyme<br>
and DNA ligase. In this case, mouse VH gene/human CH gene and<br><br>
mouse VL gene/human CL gene can be placed in one expression<br>
vector or in different expression vectors.<br>
The expression vector(s) inserted chimeric gene is<br>
introduced in myeloma cells which do not produce antibody such<br>
as P3X63-Ag8-653 cell and SP210 cell by protoplast fusion<br>
method, DEAE-dextran method, calcium phosphate method or<br>
electrical punching method. The transformed cells are<br>
selected by culturing them in culture media containing a drug<br>
which corresponds to the drug resistant gene inserted in the<br>
expression vector(s), and chimeric monoclonal antibody<br>
producing cells can be obtained.<br>
From the culture supernatant of the selected antibody<br>
producing cells, the chimeric monoclonal antibody can be<br>
obtained.<br>
"A recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody" of the<br>
present invention means genetically engineered monoclonal<br>
antibody, specifically means that a part of or the whole of<br>
the complementarity determining regions of hypervariable<br>
region is derived from that of the above mentioned monoclonal<br>
antibody(monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1 as<br>
examples), the framework regions hypervariable region are<br>
derived from that of human immunoglobulin, and the constant<br>
region is derived from that of human immunoglobulin.<br>
The complementarity determining region(s) in the<br>
hypervariable region means a part of or the whole of the three<br>
regions(CDR1, CDR2, CDR3) which exist in the hypervariable<br>
region of the variable region of antibody and complementarily<br>
binds directly with antigen. The framework region(s) in super<br>
variable region means the four regions(FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4)<br><br>
which are located before and after said three complementarity<br>
determining regions, and are relatively well maintained<br>
(constant).<br>
In other words, "Recombinant humanized monoclonal<br>
antibody" means monoclonal antibody in which all of the parts<br>
except for a part of or the whole of the complementarity<br>
determining regions of the hypervariable region of the<br>
monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are replaced<br>
with corresponding region(s) of human immunoglobulin.<br>
The constant region derived from human immunoglobulin has<br>
its proper amino acid sequence depending on its isotype such<br>
as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. The constant region of the<br>
recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody of the present<br>
invention may be the constant region of any isotype of human<br>
immunoglobulin. Preferably, the constant region of human IgG.<br>
And also, the framework region(s) in the hypervariable region<br>
derived from human immunoglobulin is not limited to one<br>
isotype.<br>
The recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody derived<br>
from the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1 included<br>
in the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can be<br>
prepared by, for example, the following steps but not limited<br>
to the following.<br>
For instance, that can be prepared by genetic engineering<br>
technique according to Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication<br>
Number HEI4-506458 and Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication<br>
Number SYOU62-296890. From the hybridoma #72-1, #86-2 or<br>
#176-1, at least one mouse H chain CDR gene and at least one<br>
mouse L chain CDR gene which corresponds to said mouse H chain<br><br>
CDR gene are isolated. From human immunoglobulin gene, human<br>
H chain gene which encodes whole region except human H chain<br>
CDR(corresponds to mouse H chain CDR), and human L chain gene<br>
which encodes whole region except human L chain<br>
CDR(corresponds to mouse L chain CDR) are isolated. Said<br>
isolated mouse H chain CDR gene and said H chain gene are<br>
operably linked and are introduced into an appropriate<br>
expression vector, and said mouse L chain CDR gene and said<br>
human L chain gene are operably linked and are introduced into<br>
another appropriate expression vector. Or otherwise, it is<br>
possible to introduce said mouse H chain CDR gene/human H<br>
chain gene and mouse L chain CDR gene/human L chain gene into<br>
the same one expression vector. By transforming host cells<br>
with the obtained expression vector(s), transformed cells<br>
which produce humanized monoclonal antibody can be obtained.<br>
By culturing said transformed cells, human monoclonal antibody<br>
can be obtained from culture supernatant.<br>
As host cells, both prokaryotic cells such as E. coll and<br>
eukaryotic cells such as CHO(Chinese hamster ovarian) cells<br>
may be used.<br>
The term "human antibody" in the present invention means<br>
that the immunoglobulin comprises entire regions including<br>
both constant and variable regions of heavy chains and<br>
those of light chains, and that it is derived from genes<br>
encoding human immunoglobulin.<br>
The human antibody is produced according to the common<br>
method. In general, the human immunoglobulin genes are<br>
incorporated into gene locus of the animals such as mice<br>
except human to obtain transgenic animals producing<br><br>
humanized antibody. Then, the transgenic animal is<br>
immunized by using any antigen. Thus, polyclonal and/or<br>
monoclonal antibodies are obtained. For instance, such<br>
transgenic mice producing human antibodies are obtained by<br>
using the method disclosed in several references: Nature<br>
Genetics, 7:13-21(1994), NIKKEI Science, June: 40-50(1995),<br>
Nature, 368:856-859(1994), and Japanese National<br>

"F(ab")" or "Fab1" of the present invention mean antibody<br>
fragments produced by treating immunoglobulin (monoclonal<br>
antibody) with proteinase such as pepsin and papain. They<br>
mean the antibody fragment(s) digested at the positions before<br>
and after the disulfide bonds between the two H chains in the<br>
hinge region. For example, when IgGl is treated with papain,<br>
it is cleaved at the upstream of the disulfide bond between<br>
the two H chains in the hinge region to make two identical<br>
fragments, i.e., L chain consisting of VL(L chain variable<br>
region) and CL(L chain constant region), and H chain fragment<br>
consisting of VH(H chain variable region) and CH?1(?1 region of<br>
the constant region of H chain) are bound at the C terminal<br>
region by disulfide bond. Each of the two identical<br>
fragments is called Fab". When treated with pepsin, IgGl is<br>
cleaved at the downstream of the disulfide bond between the<br>
two H chains at the hinge region to make one antibody fragment<br>
which is a little larger than a fragment of two Fab" connected<br>
at the hinge region. This antibody fragment is called<br>
F(ab")2-<br><br>

said antibody fragment of the present invention according to<br>
the procedures described above for preparation of the above<br>
mentioned monoclonal antibody. Specifically, antiserum<br>
derived from said mammals immunized with the above mentioned<br>

example, physical adsorption or chemical bond. As examples,<br>
the following can be used; (1) plastics composed of<br>
polystyrene resin, polycarbonate resin; silicon resin or nylon<br>
resin; plate composed of water insoluble substances such as<br>
glass; test tube or tube having inner capacity; beads, ball,<br>

carrier.<br><br>
"Immobilized monoclonal antibody" or "immobilized<br>
antibody fragment" of the present invention means the<br>
monoclonal antibody or the antibody fragment which is bound to<br>
said insoluble carrier by physical adsorption or chemical<br>

example, body fluid sample such as blood plasma, culture<br>
supernatant and centrifugation supernatant). For the purpose<br>
of said detection or assay, the immobilized monoclonal<br>
antibody or immobilized antibody fragment immobilized on the<br>
insoluble carrier mentioned above (1). Especially for assay,<br>
considering simple handling and simultaneous handling of many<br>
samples, it is preferable to use a plastic plate having many<br>
wells such as microtiter plate with 96 wells. For said<br>
separation and purification, the immobilized monoclonal<br>
antibody or immobilized antibody fragment immobilized on a<br>
filter mentioned above (1) or a membrane mentioned above (2)<br>
can be used.<br>

detectable signal independently, and with one or more other<br>
substance(s), they can provide detectable signal. For<br>
instance, in the case of enzyme, it requires at least its<br>
substrate. Various substrates are used depending on method<br>
for measuring enzyme activity(Colorimetric method,<br>
fluorescence method, bio-luminescence method or chemical<br>
luminescence method etc.). In the case of biotin, generally,<br>
it is reacted with, at least, avidin or enzymatically modified<br>
avidin, but not limited to the method. If it necessary,<br>

In the present invention, depending on purpose of assay,<br>
appropriate immunoassay can be selected. Considering easily<br>
handling and/or economical efficiency, especially considering<br>
wide clinical use, sandwich method, one pot method, single<br>
antibody solid phase method or double antibody liquid phase<br>
method is preferable. It is more preferable to use sandwich<br>
method or one pot method. It is most preferable to use<br>
sandwich method with the immobilized monoclonal antibody or<br>
the immobilized antibody fragment immobilized on a microplate<br>
having many wells such as 96 well microplate and the labeled<br>
monoclonal antibody or the labeled antibody fragment labeled<br>
with enzyme or biotin, or otherwise, one pot method with the<br>
immobilized monoclonal antibody or the immobilized antibody<br>
fragment immobilized on beads or ball and labeled monoclonal<br>
antibody or labeled antibody fragment labeled with enzyme or<br>
biotin.<br>
A specific example of the most preferable embodiment is a<br>
sandwich method or one pot method using the following<br>
combination, the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1,<br>
or their F(ab")2 or Fab1 immobilized on a microplate, beads or<br>
ball and with the monoclonal antibody #72-1, #86-2 or #176-1<br>
or their F(ab")2 or Fab1 labeled with enzyme or biotin.<br>
Although the monoclonal antibodies #72-1, #86-2 and #176-1 can<br>
be used for immobilized form as well as labeled form, it is<br><br>
preferable to use #72-1 as immobilized form and #86-2 or #176-<br>
1 as labeled form.<br>
Particularly, it is more preferable to use #72-1 (which<br>
is the monoclonal antibody derived from the hybridoma<br>
identified with FERM BP4944) as immobilized monoclonal<br>
antibody and #86-2 (which is the monoclonal antibody derived<br>
from the hybridoma identified with FERM BP4945) as labeled<br>
one.<br>

The term "affinity chromatography" in the present<br>
invention means the chromatography for separation or<br>
purification of human CETP contained in a sample by using<br>
the affinity between the antigen and antibody. As the<br>
examples of the sample, body fluids such as plasma, culture<br>
supernatants, or cetrifugation suprenatants are given.<br><br>
Specifically, the following two methods are given as<br>
examples.<br>
(1) A chromatography for separating the human CETP in<br>
the sample, wherein the sample is applied to the above-<br>
mentioned insoluble carrier such as filter or membrane for<br>
immobilizing the monoclonal antibody having reactivity to<br>
human CETP or its fragment of the present invention to<br>
separate the human CETP.<br>
(2) A chromatography for separating or purifying the<br>
human CETP in the sample, wherein the sample is applied to<br>
the above-mentioned insoluble carrier for immobilizing the<br>
monoclonal antibody or its fragment, and the carrier is<br>
packed into the column for applying the sample to elute to<br>
separate or purify the human CETP.<br>
In this method, as the example of the insoluble<br>
carriers, cellulose type, agarose type, polyacrylamide<br>
type, dextran type, polystyrene type, polyvinyl alcohol<br>
type, polyamino acid type ones and so forth are given. The<br>
monoclonal antibody or its fragment are immobilized on the<br>
insoluble carrier by means of the known method such as<br>
physical adsorption, polymerization by cross-link, trapping<br>
in the carrier matrix, or immobilization by non-covalent<br>
bond. Such carriers are packed into the columns such as a<br>
glass, plastic and stainless column having the<br>
configuration such as cylindrical one. Particularly, the<br>
latter chromatography is referred to as the affinity<br>
chromatography here.<br>
As the insoluble carriers for the affinity<br>
chromatography, any types of those may be used when they<br><br>

"Mice introduced DNA encoding human CETP" may be<br>
produced by the techniques employed generally in the field<br>
of the transgenic mouse production (See The newest animal<br>
cell experiment manual, AIC press, Chapter 7, pp. 361-408,<br>
1990).<br>
Tall et al. reported that they produce a transgenic<br>
mouse introduced human CETP gene. However, the mouse can<br>
not secrete CETP in blood when it requires extrinsic or<br>
artificial induction such as taking foods supplemented<br>
zinc. In contrast, the transgenic mouse of the present<br>
invention secretes human CETP constantly without any<br><br>
induction described above, and such a transgenic mouse is<br>
not reported.<br>
"Pharmaceutical composition" contains the monoclonal<br>
antibody or its fragment of the present invention, and may<br>
contain pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as<br>
excipients, diluent, vehicles, disintegrators, stabilizers,<br>
preservatives, buffering agents, emulsifiers, aromatics,<br>
coloring agents, sweetening agents, thickning agents,<br>
fravering agents, solubilizing agents, or other additives.<br>
Such pharmaceutical preparations may be formed as tablets,<br>
pills, powders, granules, injections, liquid preparations,<br>
capsules, troches, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, or<br>
syrups. The pharmaceutical preparations may be<br>
administrated via oral or parental.<br>
In particular, the injections may be prepared by<br>
dissolving or suspending the pharmaceutical preparations in<br>
the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier without toxicity at<br>
the certain concentration. The carrier may be<br>
physiological saline, distilled water for injections. The<br>
certain range is from 0.1 µg of the monoclonal antibody/ml<br>
of carrier to 10 mg of the antibody/ml of carrier. Such<br>
injections may be administrated to patients need treatment<br>
at the dosage of 1 µg to 100 mg/kg of body weight,<br>
preferably at 50 µg to 50 mg/kg of body weight for one to<br>
several times per day. This administration is performed<br>
via clinically suitable routes such as intravenously,<br>
subcuteneously, intradermally, in intramuscle, in<br>
intraperitoneal and so forth. Preferable is intravenous<br>
administration.<br><br>

However, the present invention is not limited to such<br>
examples.<br>
(Example 1) Establish of CETP activity assay system<br>
In the present invention for determining the CETP<br>
activity (cholesterol ester (abbreviated as CE) transporting<br>
activity), the assay system constructed as described below<br>
was employed unless it was specially stated. The assay<br>
system of the present invention is a modified one according<br>
to the method of Alberts et al., Arteriosclerosis, vol. 4,<br>
49-58(1984). Briefly, the assay system was as follows.<br>
Firstly, a donor lipoprotein comprising high density<br>
lipoprotein in which radio-labeled cholesterol ester (HDL3)<br>
was incorporated. An acceptor lipoprotein comprising low<br>
density lipoprotein (LDL), and a sample containing CETP for<br>
assay were mixed to physiologically react with each other.<br>
Then, the amount of labeled CE transported from the donor<br>
lipoprotein to the acceptor lipoprotein was determined by<br>
using either the decrease of the radioactivity of the donor<br>
lipoprotein or increase of that of the acceptor lipoprotein<br>
to determine CETP activity of CETP in the sample.<br><br> Preparation of donor lipoprotein<br>
Potassium bromide(KBr) was added to 20 ml of healthy<br>
volunteer plasma to adjust its comparative gravity, d=1.125<br>
g/ral. After that, the plasma was subjected to density<br>
gradient centrifugation by 227,000 x g at 4°C for 17 hours,<br>
and then obtained the fraction of which comparative gravity<br>
was d&gt;1.125 g/ml(HDL3 fraction). The fraction obtained was<br>
dialyzed against TBS(0.15 M NaCl/10 mM Tris(pH 7-4)).<br>
Then, 10 nM of tritium labeled cholesterol([3H]C, specific<br>
activity 50.3 Ci/mM) was gradually dissolved in 95 %<br>
ethanol with stirring slowly. The solution was incubated<br>
for 18 hr at 37°C. During the incubation, tritium<br>
cholesterol ([3H]C) attached onto the surface of HDL3 was<br>
esterified by Lecithin Cholesterol acyltransferase(LCAT) to<br>
be converted to tritium labeled cholesterol ester([3H]CE).<br>
Then [3H]CE was incorporated into HDL3.<br>
KBr was added into the human plasma to adjust its<br>
comparative gravity, d=1.21 g/ml. After that, the plasma<br>
was subjected to density gradient centrifugation by 227,000<br>
x g at 4°C for 20 hours, and then obtained the fraction of<br>
which comparative gravity was d
fraction obtained was dialyzed against TBS described<br>
before, and then obtained HDL3([3H]CE~HDL3; comparative<br>
gravity is 1.125<d specific activity is></d>
dpm/nM). This fraction was used as the donor lipoprotein.<br><l-2> Preparation of acceptor lipoprotein<br>
Potassium bromide (KBr) was added to 100 ml of healthy<br>
volunteer plasma to adjust its comparative gravity, d=1.019<br>
g/ml. After that, the plasma was subjected to density<br><br>
gradient centrifugation by 227,000 x g at 4°C for 20 hours,<br>
and then obtained the fraction of which comparative gravity<br>
was d&gt;1.019 g/ml. The fraction obtained was dialyzed<br>
against TBS described above. Then, KBr was added again to<br>
adjust the gravity d=1.063 g/ml. The solution was<br>
subjected to the density gradient centrifugation by 227,000<br>
x g at 4°C for 20 hr, and then obtained the fraction with<br>
d
TBS described above, and then obtained the fraction<br>
comprising LDL(the comparative gravity:1.019<d to be></d>
used acceptor lipoprotein).<br><l-3> Determination of CETP activity<br>
The donor lipoprotein obtained in Example 
1&gt;( [3H]CE-HDL3 which contains 0.21 jig of cholesterol), the<br>
acceptor lipoprotein(LDL which contains 21 µg of<br>
cholesterol), and a sample for assay were mixed in a<br>
microtube. Then, TBS described above was also added into<br>
the microtube to adjust the ratio of cholesterol content in<br>
the donor lipoprotein to that in the acceptor lipoprotein<br>
equals to 1:100, and the ratio of cholesterol in HDL<br>
contained in the assay sample to that in the donor<br>
lipoprotein equals at least 1:10(total volume is 600<br>
µl/tube). The tube was incubated for 15 hr in water bath<br>
at 37°C. Then, the tube was transferred onto ice for 15<br>
minutes. After that, 400 µl of the iced TBS and 40 µ1 of 1<br>
% dextran sulfate solution containing 0.5 M MgCl2 were<br>
added into the microtube, and vigorously vortexed. The<br>
microtube was incubated for 30 minutes on ice. Then, the<br>
tube was subjected to centrifugation by 8,000 x g at 4°C<br><br>
for 10 minutes, and then recovered HDL rich supernatant.<br>
The radioactivity in the supernatant was measured by means<br>
of a Scintillation counter.<br>
In order to determine CETP activity of the assay<br>
sample contained CETP, the radioactivity of the control<br>
sample which does not contain the assay sample was also<br>
measured by treating as the same as the procedure described<br>
above. CETP activity was determined based on the decrease<br>
of the radioactivity by comparing to that in the assay<br>
samples to that in the control sample. The activity was<br>
expressed as unit, and the CETP activity for transporting 1<br>
nM of cholesterol per one unit time was represented as 1<br>
unit(U).<br>
(Example 2) Preparation of purified CETP derived from<br>
human<br>
The procedure described below was performed at 4°C or<br>
in ice bath according to the known method.<br> Dextran sulfate treatment<br>
The peripheral blood was obtained from healthy<br>
volunteers. Red blood cells in the blood were removed by<br>
the centrifugation by the known method, and then obtained 1<br>
L of human plasma. Two liters of distilled water, 100 ml<br>
of 10 % dextran sulfate having molecular weight of 500,000<br>
Da, and 80 ml of 4 M CaCl2 were added into the obtained<br>
plasma with gentle stirring on ice bath for 15 minutes.<br>
The mixed solution was centrifuged by 15,200 x g for 1 hr<br>
to fractionate insoluble dextran sulfate/lipoprotein<br>
complex as precipitate. The supernatant was collected, and<br>
27.2 % BaCl2 was added to adjust the final concentration of<br><br>
the solution to 1.36 %. The mixed solution was stirred for<br>
20 minutes, and then centrifuged by 15,200 x g for 1 hr.<br>
The precipitate was removed, and the supernatant was<br>
collected.<br> Purification by phenyl Sepharose column<br>
chromatography<br>
Three molar of NaCl, 0.01 % sodium azide(NaN3), 50<br>
pg/ml of Gentamysin sulfate, and 0.05 % ethylenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acid(EDTA) were added into the supernatant<br>
obtained in Example. The mixture was adjusted to pH<br>
7.4. Phenyl Sepharose HP column(10 x 12.5 cm, Pharmacia<br>
Biotech) was equilibrated with 3 M NaCl(pH 7.4) containing<br>
0.01 % NaN3, 50 µg/ml of Gentamysin sulfate, and 0.05 %<br>
EDTA as mentioned above. The mixture was applied into the<br>
phenyl sepharose column. After that the column was washed<br>
with 3 L of 0.15 M NaCl solution(pH 7.4), subsequently with<br>
3 L of the solution without NaCl(pH 7.4), and then eluted<br>
with 20 % ethanol. The elution profile was monitored by<br>
using absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
The result was shown in Fig. 1. Based on the elution<br>
profile, active fractions containing CETP derived from<br>
human was collected.<br> Purification by means of Resource Q column<br>
choromatography<br>
The active fractions collected in Example was<br>
dialyzed against the buffer(pH 7.4) comprising 25 mM NaCl<br>
and 10 mM Tris-HCl. Then, the dialyzed fraction was<br>
applied to Resource Q column(3.5 x 10 cm, Pharmacia<br>
Biotech) equilibrated with buffer. The column was washed<br><br>
with 300 ml of the above-mentioned buffer, and eluted with<br>
2 L of 25-250 mM gradient NaCl(pH 7.4). The elution<br>
profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 2. Based on the elution<br>
profile, active fractions containing CETP derived from<br>
human was collected to obtain purified CETP derived from<br>
human.<br>
(Example 3) Preparation of anti-human CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody<br>
Human CETP monoclonal antibody was prepared according<br>
to the known method described in references such as<br>
Experimental Medicine suppl. "Cell Technology Handbook"<br>
(Toshio Kuroki et al. ed., pp. 66-74, Yodo press(1992)) or<br>
An introduction of monoclonal antibody experimental<br>
procedure(Tamio Ando et al., Kodansha(1991)).<br> Immunization, cell fusion, and cloning<br>
Purified human CETP prepared in Example 2 with<br>
Freund"s complete adjuvant was injected into foot pads of<br>
BALB/c mice (female, 4-5 week age, purchased from Shizuoka<br>
experimental animal center) for the first immunization. Day<br>
5th, 10th, 15th from the first immunization, the purified<br>
human CETP was injected into the foot pads of the immunized<br>
mice as the additional immunization. Furthermore, the<br>
purified human CETP was given similarly to the mice as the<br>
final immunization before one or two days from the day that<br>
the preparation of monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma<br>
was performed. Lymph nodes of knee was excised from the<br>
mice by a surgical operation according to known methods.<br>
The lymphocytes obtained from the lymph node and mouse<br><br>
myeloma cells, PAI were fused by using polyethylene glycol<br>
4000 as a fusion agent (at the ratio of 3:1). Then, the<br>
hybridomas were cultured in ASF104 medium(AGF) comprising<br>
HAT with aminopterine containing 10 % fetal calf serum.<br>
Then the media was changed to HT medium without<br>
aminopterine to select the hybridoma prepared by fusion of<br>
the lymphocytes and the myeloma cells. The number of<br>
obtained clones was 169.<br> Screening of hybridoma<br>
Hybridoma producing anti-human CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody was screened by the CETP activity assay system<br>
established in Example 1.<br>
The purified human CETP prepared in Example 2 and each<br>
culture supernatant of the hybridoma screened(60 µl) were<br>
added into the mixture of the donor lipoprotein prepared in<br>
Example<l-1>([3H]CE-HDL3 containing 0.21 µg of cholesterol)<br>
and the acceptor lipoprotein prepared in Example<l-2> (LDL<br>
containing 21 µg of cholesterol). Then, TBS was added to<br>
prepare the total volume of 600 µl/tube.<br>
The prepared solution was treated similarly to the<br>
procedure described in Example<l-3>. The activity of CETP<br>
was determined in each sample by comparing with the<br>
activity of the control sample to obtain the CETP<br>
inhibition activity(inhibition activity against CE-<br>
transporting activity of CETP) in the culture supernatant<br>
of the hybridoma. By means of the screening, three<br>
positive clones, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1, which have<br>
different CETP inhibition activities were obtained.<br><br>
Two hybridoma, #72-1 and #86-2 were deposited to<br>
National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology<br>
Agency of Industrial Science and Technology at the date of<br>
Dec. 20, 1994, and International accession numbers are FERM<br>
BP-4944 and FERM BP-4945, respectively.<br> Large scale preparation of monoclonal antibody<br>
Each of the hybridoma #72-1, #86-2, or #176-1 (106 to<br>
107 cells/0.5 ml/mouse) were administrated to 15 of ICR<br>
nude mice(female, 7-8 week age, purchased from Charles<br>
River) via intraperitoneally. Ten days later, ascites were<br>
collected from the mice anesthetized according to the known<br>
method. The monoclonal antibodies were prepared in large<br>
scale as supernatants of centrifugation.<br> Isotyping<br>
Isotyping for the monoclonal antibodies, #72-1, #86-2,<br>
and #176-1, were performed with Mouse monoclonal antibody<br>
isotyping kit(Amersham) according to the protocol<br>
supplemented to the kit. The result showed that both #72-1<br>
and #86-2 were IgGl, and #176-1 was IgG2b.<br> Purification of the monoclonal antibody<br>
Five ml of the each monoclonal antibodies, #72-1, #86-<br>
2, and #176-1, prepared as the supernatant, were diluted by<br>
triple times with 0.06 M acetate buffer(pH 4.0), and pH was<br>
adjusted to 4.8 with 1 N HC1. Then, 16.5 pi of caprilyc<br>
acid(Wako Pure Chemical) was gradually added into the<br>
diluted solution at room temperature to react for 30<br>
minutes. After that, the mixture was centrifuged by 10,000<br>
rpm for 20 minutes to precipitate proteins except<br>
antibodies. Supernatants were collected, and filtrated<br><br>
with the filter(Millipore) to remove white precipitates.<br>
Filtrates were dialyzed against phosphate buffer for 2 hr.<br>
After dialysis, ammonium sulfate(26.2 g/100 ml) was<br>
added little by little with stirring to react at 4°C for<br>
120 minutes. Then, the mixture was centrifuged by 10,000<br>
rpm for 20 minutes to collect precipitates. Phosphate<br>
buffer was added to the precipitate, and dialyzed against<br>
to phosphate buffer at 4°C for 24 hr, and then obtained the<br>
purified monoclonal antibody, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1,<br>
respectively.<br>
(Example 4) Purification of human CETP by affinity<br>
chromatography<br>
The purified human CETP prepared in Example 2 was<br>
further purified by means of the affinity column<br>
chromatography which used the monoclonal antibody, #72-1,<br>
and then characterized.<br><br>
Preparation of immobilized monoclonal antibody as a<br>
adsorbent media for column packing<br>
HiTrap-NHS-activated Sepharose HP column(1 ml, Pharmacia<br>
Biotech) was employed, and the experiment operation was<br>
performed according to the attached protocol. The<br>
monoclonal antibody, #72-1, was dissolved in 0.2 M sodium<br>
hydrogen carbonate(pH 8.3) containing 0.5 M NaCl was<br>
injected into the column at the ratio of 5 mg/ml. Then,<br>
the monoclonal antibody was reacted with the column for 45<br>
minutes to immobilize onto NHS-activated Sepharose to<br>
prepare the immobilized monoclonal antibody #72-1.<br> Purification by affinity chromatography<br><br>
A solution containing the purified human CETP obtained<br>
in Example 2 was applied on the column prepared in<br>
Example. Then, the column was washed with 5 ml of 50<br>
mM Tris-HCl buffer(pH 7.6) containing 500 mM NaCl, and<br>
eluted with 2 mM glycine-HCl(pH 2.8). The eluted fraction<br>
was neutralized with 2 M Tris-HCl(pH 8.8). The elution<br>
profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The<br>
result was shown in Fig. 3. Based on the elution profile,<br>
active fractions containing human CETP were pooled. The<br>
pooled fraction were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl<br>
containing 0.15 M NaCl(pH 7.6), and the highly purified<br>
human CETP was prepared.<br> Characterization of purified human CETP<br>
As described in Fig. 3, enzyme activity (specific<br>
activity) of CETP obtained in Example 4 was 1,100 U/mg.<br>
The molecular weight of the purified human CETP was<br>
analyzed by using SDS-PAGE(sodium dodecyl sulfate<br>
polyacrylamido gel electrophoresis).<br>
The result was shown in Fig. 4.<br>
It was confirmed that the purified human CETP obtained<br>
in Example 4 comprises two proteins with about 63,000 Da<br>
and 61,000 Da. Many researchers tried to purify the human<br>
CETP, and the values of the molecular weight were reported.<br>
Such values were not identical each other, because the<br>
purification method, purity of the protein and/or analysis<br>
of the molecular weight were different. However, they are<br>
in the range of about 64,000 to 66,000 Da. Compared to<br>
such values, it was demonstrated that the purity of the<br>
CETP obtained in Example 4 was very high.<br><br>
(Example 5) Characterization of Anti-human CETP monoclonal<br>
antibody<br> Reactivity to the human CETP<br>
The reactivity of each of the purified monoclonal<br>
antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1, prepared in Example 3<br>
was confirmed by determining human CETP transporting<br>
activity assayed by means of CETP activity assay system<br>
established in Example 1 as the same as Example.<br>
The purified human CETP prepared in Example 4, and<br>
each of the monoclonal antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-<br>
1, which were diluted with Tris-HCl buffer(pH 7.4)<br>
containing 0.15 M NaCl at the various concentration, were<br>
added into the mixture of the donor lipoprotein([3H]CE-HDL3<br>
containing 0.21 g of cholesterol) prepared in Example<l-1><br>
and the acceptor lipoprotein(LDL containing 21 ^g of<br>
cholesterol) prepared in Example<l-2>. Then TBS was<br>
further added to prepare the total volume of 600 µl/tube.<br>
The prepared solution was treated similarly to the<br>
procedure described in Example<l-3>. The CETP activity of<br>
each sample and the control without the monoclonal antibody<br>
were determined. Comparing the values of the corresponding<br>
samples, the CETP inhibition activity of each monoclonal<br>
antibody was determined. As the reference, mouse IgG was<br>
also used. The result is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
The monolonal antibody, #72-1, showed dose-dependent<br>
inhibition of the human CETP activity, particularly, the<br>
human CETP activity was inhibited 100 % at the<br>
concentration equal to or more than 10 µg/ml. In contrast,<br>
the monoclonal antibody, #86-2, did not show dose-dependent<br><br>
inhibition. This monoclonal antibody showed the maximum<br>
inhibition(58 %) at the concentration about 0.5 /jg/ml;<br>
however, it did not show any inhibition at the<br>
concentration equal to or more than 17 µg/ml. The<br>
monoclonal antibody, #176-1, did not show dose-dependent<br>
CETP inhibition activity, neither did #86-2, and it showed<br>
the maximum inhibition(50 %) at the concentration of about<br>
1.0 ^g/ml.<br>
Based on the above results, it was demonstrated that<br>
the epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody #72-1 was<br>
different from that recognized by other monoclonal<br>
antibodies, #86-2 or #176-1 with high possibility.<br> Reactivity for rabbit CETP<br>
The respective reactivity of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1 prepared in Example 3<br>
for the rabbit CETP was confirmed by means of the CETP<br>
activity assay system similar to that of Example 1. The<br>
purified rabbit CETP, the donor lipoprotein and the<br>
acceptor lipoprotein used for the assay system were<br>
prepared as described below.<br> Preparation of the purified rabbit CETP<br>
The following procedure was performed according to the<br>
known method at 4°C or in ice bath.<br>
(1) Dextran sulfate treatment<br>
Peripheral blood was obtained from plural<br>
rabbits(Japan white, Kitayama rabes). The blood was<br>
centrifuged to remove red blood cells according to the<br>
conventional method, and one hundred ml of rabbit plasma<br>
was obtained. Two hundred ml of distilled water, 10 ml of<br><br>
10 % of dextran sul fate (molecular weight 500,000 Da), and<br>
7.9 ml of 4 M CaCl2 were added into the 100 ml of the<br>
plasma obtained, and gently stirred in ice bath for 15<br>
minutes. The mixture was centrifuged by 20,000 x g for 20<br>
hr at 4 °C to fractionate the insoluble dextran<br>
sulfate/lipoprotein complex, and then collected the<br>
supernatants.<br>
(2) Purification by Phenyl Sepharose column chromatography<br>
Three molar of NaCl, 0.01 % NaN3, 50 µg/ml of<br>
Gentamysin sulfate, and 0.05 % EDTA were added to the<br>
supernatant obtained, and adjusted pH 7.4. Prior to apply<br>
the mixture, Hiload 26/10(Phenyl Sepharose column,<br>
Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated with the same solution<br>
described above. Then, the mixture was applied on the<br>
column, and washed with 0.15 M NaCl solution (pH 7.4)<br>
containing the same concentration of NaN3, Gentamysin<br>
sulfate and EDTA. After that, adsorbed components were<br>
eluted by using the solution without NaCl and 20% ethanol.<br>
The elution profile was monitored absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 6. Based on the elution<br>
profile, the active fractions containing rabbit CETP were<br>
pooled.<br>
(3) Purification of Blue Sepharose column chromatography<br>
The active fractions pooled in the above (2) was<br>
dialyzed against 50 mM HEPES buffer(N-2-<br>
hydroxyethylpiperadine-N" -2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 7.0).<br>
Then, the dialyzed sample was applied on Blue Sepharose<br>
column(CL-6B, 1.5 x 8.5 cm, Pharmacia Biotech) which was<br>
equilibrated with the buffer. The column was washed with<br><br>
the buffer, and then eluted with the solution containing<br>
1.5 M NaCl and the buffer(pH 7.0). The elution profile was<br>
monitored by absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 7. Based on the elution<br>
profile, the active fractions containing rabbit CETP were<br>
pooled.<br>
(4) Purification by succinylated LDL Sepharose column<br>
chromatography<br>
The active fractions pooled in the above (3) was<br>
dialyzed against the 50 mM HEPES buffer(pH 7.4). Then,<br>
succinylated LDL Sepharose column was prepared by using<br>
succinyl LDL and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B(1.5 x 8.5 cm,<br>
Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with the<br>
39 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.025 % EDTA and 60 mM<br>
NaCl(pH 7.4). Then, the dialyzed sample was applied on the<br>
column. The column was washed with the same buffer, and<br>
then eluted with the buffer(pH 7.4) containing 0.01 % EDTA.<br>
The elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 8. Based on the elution<br>
profile, the active fractions containing rabbit CETP were<br>
pooled.<br> The donor lipoprotein and the acceptor lipoprotein<br>
According to the similar method described in both<br>
Example<l-1> and <l-2>, both the donor lipoprotein([3H]CE-<br>
HDL3 containing 0.21 µg cholesterol) and the acceptor<br>
lipoprotein(LDL containing 21 µg of cholesterol) were<br>
prepared by using the rabbit plasma.<br> Confirmation of the reactivity for rabbit CETP<br><br>
The respective reactivity of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1 against the rabbit<br>
CETP was confirmed by means of the CETP activity assay<br>
system in which purified rabbit CETP prepared in ,<br>
and the donor lipoprotein prepared and the acceptor<br>
lipoprotein prepared in  were used as the same as<br>
that of Example .<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 9. Neither monoclonal<br>
antibody #86-2 nor #176-1 showed rabbit CETP inhibition<br>
activity independent of their concentration. Accordingly,<br>
these monoclonal antibodies did not have the specific<br>
reactivity for the rabbit CETP. Furthermore, the<br>
monoclonal antibody #72-1 did not show the detectable<br>
reactivity at the concentration equal to or less than 3<br>
fig/ml.<br>
(Example 6) Preparation of antibody fragments, F(ab")2 and<br>
Fab<br>
The F(ab")2 and Fab of the purified monoclonal<br>
antibodies prepared in Example 3, #72-1, #86-2, and #176-1<br>
were prepared as follows.<br>
Each of the monoclonal antibodies was added into 20 mM<br>
acetate buffer(pH 3.5) at the concentration of 5 mg/ml<br>
respectively, and incubated for 30 minutes. Then, one ml<br>
of insolubilized pepsin (Pierce) was added to the incubated<br>
solution, and further incubated for 12 hr at 37°C rotating<br>
by using a rotator. After that, the reaction mixture was<br>
centrifuged by 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C to collect<br>
supernatants as the first supernatant.<br><br>
The supernatant was subjected to the Protein A<br>
affinity chromatography by using Protein A column<br>
kit (Amersham), and the procedure was performed acceding to<br>
the attached protocol. A binding buffer was added to the<br>
precipitate to suspend, and then the suspension was<br>
centrifuged by 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C to collect<br>
supernatants as the second supernatant. Both the first and<br>
second supernatant were pooled, and the same amount of the<br>
binding buffer was added. Then, 1 N sodium hydroxide was<br>
added to adjust pH 8.9. Protein A Sepharose column was<br>
equilibrated with the binding buffer prior to applying the<br>
mixture. The column was washed twice with 5 ml of the<br>
binding buffer, and then the eluted fractions were<br>
obtained. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against 2 L<br>
of 5 mM phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for 24 hr at 4°C.<br>
Further purification, the dialyzed sample was<br>
subjected to HPLC by using Hydroxyl apatite column(Bio<br>
Rad). The dialyzed sample was applied onto the Hydroxyl<br>
apatite column. Then, the column was washed with 5 mM<br>
phosphate buffer for 5 minutes. Retained components in the<br>
column were subsequently eluted, with gradient elution<br>
buffer of 5 mM to 0.4 M phosphate buffer. The eluents were<br>
fractionated by using a fraction collector. The elution<br>
profile were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm to monitor<br>
the amount of F(ab")2 contained in the fracitions to pool<br>
the active fractions. The pooled fractions were dialyzed<br>
against 2 L of phosphate buffer at 4 °C for 24 hr to obtain<br>
the respective F(ab")2 of the monoclonal antibodies, #72-1,<br>
#86-2, and #176-1.<br><br>
(Example 7) Establishment of human CETP assay method by<br>
using sandwich ELISA<br> Preparation of the solid phase with immobilized<br>
monoclonal antibody<br>
Each of the purified monoclonal antibodies, #72-1,<br>
#86-2 and #176-1 prepared in Example 3 were diluted with<br>
phosphate buffer(pH 7.4) so as to be 10 ng/well to 1<br>
µg/well. Fifty pi of the diluted antibody solutions were<br>
added into wells of 96 well microtiter plates for<br>
ELISA(Corning). The plates with the solutions were<br>
incubated at 4°C for 24 hr to adsorb each monoclonal<br>
antibody onto the inside of the well. Then, the well was<br>
washed with 300 jjI of phosphate solution containing 0.1 %<br>
Tween 20 for four times. After discarded the phosphate<br>
buffer, 300 µl of the blocking agent, Block Ace(Dainippon<br>
Pharmaceutical), was added to the well to incubate for 2 hr<br>
to block the antibody unbound sites. Each well was washed<br>
with 300 µl of phosphate solution containing 0.1 % Tween 20<br>
for four times.<br> Preparation of labeled monoclonal antibodies<br>
One mg/ml of each of the purified monoclonal antibody<br>
solutions, #72-1, #86-2 and #176-1, prepared in Example 3<br>
were dialyzed against 0.1 M NaHCO3(pH 8.2 to 8.3) at 4 °C<br>
for 24 hr. Then, one hundred pi of NHS-biotin(2 mg/ml,<br>
Funakoshi) was added into the dialyzed antibody solution,<br>
and stirred vigorously. The antibody solution was<br>
incubated for 4 hr at room temperature. After that the<br>
antibody solution was dialyzed against phosphate buffer at<br>
4 °C for 4 hr.<br><br> Establishment of the assay method by using sandwich<br>
ELISA<br>
The human CETP assay method by using sandwich ELISA<br>
established of the present invention was as follows.<br>
Each of the monoclonal antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and<br>
#176-1 was immobilized respectively onto the microplates at<br>
the concentration of 10 ng/well to 1 ^g/well as described<br>
in . The above-mentioned microplates prepared was<br>
referred to as the immobilized microplate. The immobilized<br>
plates were washed with phosphate buffer containing 0.1 %<br>
Tween 20 for 3 times. Phosphate buffer containing 10 %<br>
Block Ace was used for diluting the samples which were the<br>
purified human CETP standard prepared in Example , the<br>
plasma of healthy volunteers without lipoprotein prepared<br>
in Example , or the plasma of various patients. The<br>
immobilized plates with 100 µl of the diluted samples were<br>
incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. The plates were<br>
washed with the phosphate buffer containing 0.1 % Tween 20<br>
for three times. The biotin labeled monoclonal antibodies,<br>
#72-1, #86-2, or #176-1, prepared in Example  were<br>
diluted with the phosphate buffer containing 10 % Block Ace<br>
to 3 ng to 1 µg/50 µl/well. Then, the plates with 50 µl of<br>
the biotin labeled monoclonal antibodies were incubated at<br>
room temperature for 1 hr. After that, the plates were<br>
washed with the phosphate buffer containing 0.1 % Tween 20<br>
for 3 times. Fifty µl of streptoavidin-ß-<br>
galactosidase(Gibco BKL) diluted 1,000 times with 20 mM<br>
HEPES buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl(pH 7.0) was added into<br><br>
each well of the immobilized plates. Then, the immobilized<br>
microplates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hr.<br>
The immobilized microplates were washed with the<br>
phosphate buffer containing 0.1 % Tween 20 for three times.<br>
After that, fifty µ1 of 0.015 % or 0.01 % of 4-methyl-<br>
umbelliferyl-ß-D-galactoside(Sigma) diluted with 10 mM<br>
phosphate buffer containing 1 mg/ml of BSA, 100 mM NaCl, 1<br>
mM MgCl2(pH 7.0) was added into each well of the<br>
immobilized microplates. Then, the immobilized microplates<br>
were incubated at room temperature for 10 or 20 minutes.<br>
After that, one hundred jvl of Na2CO3 solution was added<br>
into the wells to terminate the reaction. Intensity of the<br>
wells were measured with Fluoroscan II microplate<br>
fluorometer(Flow Laboratories) at 460 nm of the emission<br>
wave length and the 355 nm of excitation one. The amount<br>
of CETP in the sample was determined from the calibration<br>
curve obtained in the following Example. The results of<br>
the assay when various combination of the monoclonal<br>
antibodies(#72-1, #86-2, and #176-1) immobilized or labeled<br>
are shown in Figs. 10 to 12. As a result, it was confirmed<br>
that the above-mentioned monoclonal antibody amount were<br>
quantitatively determined when the different monoclonal<br>
antibodies immobilized or labeled were combined, for<br>
example, #72-1 and #86-2, or #72-1 and #176-1.<br>
The optimal concentration of the immobilized or the<br>
labeled monoclonal antibody were determined under the<br>
following conditions. As the substrate, 4-methyl-<br>
umbelliferyl-ß-D-galactoside was used, and as the assay<br><br>
sample, the plasma from the healthy volunteers without<br>
lipoprotein prepared in Example 2 was used.<br>
(1) the immobilized monoclonal antibody:<br>
#72-1(10 ng to 1 µg/well)<br>
the labeled monoclonal antibody:<br>
#86-2 or #176-1(10 ng to 1 µg/well)<br>
substrate concentration: 0.01 %<br>
reaction time: 10 minutes<br>
(2) the immobilized monoclonal antibody:<br>
#72-1(1 µg/well)<br>
the labeled monoclonal antibody:<br>
#86-2(1 to 3 ng/well)<br>
substrate concentration: 0.015 %<br>
reaction time: 20 minutes<br>
The result are shown in Figs. 13 to 17.<br>
As shown in Figs. 13 to 17, the optimal concentration<br>
of the immobilized monoclonal antibody, #72-1 was 1<br>
jig/well(20 µg/ml). That of the labeled monoclonal<br>
antibody, #86-2 was 100 ng/well(2 µg/ml) when the reaction<br>
time was 10 minutes, and 3 ng/well(60 ng/ml) when the<br>
reaction time was 20 minutes. Accordingly, the optimal<br>
concentration of the labeled monoclonal antibody may be<br>
changed since the concentration depends on the reaction<br>
time for substrate.<br>
In the following Examples, the sandwich ELISA was<br>
employed, and the conditions were as follows:<br>
the immobilized monoclonal antibody:<br>
#72-1(1 µg /well (20 µg/ml))<br>
the labeled monoclonal antibody:<br><br>
#86-2(3 ng/well(60 µg/ml))<br>
the reaction time for substrate: 20 minutes<br> Preparation of a calibration curve and confirmation<br>
of accuracy<br><br>
A calibration curve was prepared by using the sandwich<br>
ELISA established in Example . As Standard, the<br>
purified human CETP prepared in  was used. As the<br>
immobilized monoclonal antibody, #72-1(1 µg/well), and as<br>
the labeled one, #86-2(3 ng/well) were also used. The<br>
result is shown in Fig. 18.<br>
As shown in Fig. 18, the calibration curve was almost<br>
linear at the range of very low concentration between 0.4<br>
to 1.25 ng/ml(correlation coefficient: r=0.995). The<br>
determination limit (the detection limit) of the sandwich<br>
ELISA of the present invention was 0.4 ng/ml. Accordingly,<br>
it was demonstrated that the sandwich ELISA of the present<br>
invention had excellent sensitivity of determination, that<br>
is, excellent sensitivity of detection.<br> Calculation of coefficient of variation<br>
In order to study the accuracy of the assay method of<br>
the present invention, the coefficient of variation(c.v.)<br>
among 48 wells in a 96 well plate or different 6 plates was<br>
calculated. The c.v. obtained in the same plate was 7.06<br>
%, and that obtained in different plates was 6.13 %.<br>
Accordingly, it was demonstrated that the assay system by<br>
using the sandwich ELISA of the present invention has high<br>
accuracy.<br><br> Preliminary experiment for establishment of the<br>
human CETP assay system<br> Study of the effect of the determination(assay)<br>
capability by human plasma components<br>
In order to study whether the plasma components which<br>
interfere the human CETP determination was contained in<br>
human plasma or not, the following tests were performed.<br>
The purified human CETP prepared in Example  with<br>
either 0.735 µg/ml, or 1.469 µg/ml were added into the<br>
plasma from the healthy volunteers prepared in Example 
1&gt; which contained 0.56 µg/ml of CETP. Then, The amount of<br>
CETP was determined by using the method established in the<br>
above-mentioned .<br>
When 0.735 pg/ml or 1.469 pg/ml of CETP was added, the<br>
total CETP amount of each sample before incubation was<br>
calculated as 1.294 µg/ml or 2.029 µg/ml respectively. On<br>
the other hand, the total amounts of CETP recovered were<br>
1.440 µg/ml and 2.189 µg/ml, and the recovery percentages<br>
were 111 % and 108 % respectively.<br>
As a result, it was demonstrated that the human plasma<br>
did not contain any component which interfere the<br>
determination(assay) of CETP by the method of the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, it was shown that the amount of<br>
CETP in human plasma was accurately determined by using the<br>
method of the present invention.<br> Effect of lipoproteins in human plasma<br>
In order to study effect given by the substances<br>
except CETP such as lipoproteins for the human CETP<br>
determination, the human CETP with different purity as the<br><br>
assay sample was determined by using the assay system<br>
established in the .above-mentioned .<br>
For the determination, the following samples were used<br>
as the samples.<br>
(1) the plasma without hemocytes by centrifugation<br>
prepared in Example<br>
(2) the plasma without lipoprotein finally prepared in<br>
Example<br>
(3) the purified CETP with the Phenyl Sepharose column<br>
prepared in Example <br>
(4) the purified human CETP prepared in Example <br>
The result is shown in Fig. 19. Dilution curves<br>
obtained were respectively parallel with that of the<br>
purified human CETP(4).<br>
As a result, it was demonstrated that the lipoproteins<br>
in human plasma did not interfere the determination of CETP<br>
by the method of the present invention. Accordingly, it<br>
was shown that the determination method of the present<br>
invention may be apply to plasma irrespective of the<br>
sample"s purity.<br> Correlation of CETP contents and CETP activities<br>
In order to investigated the precision of the<br>
determination method of the present invention, the<br>
correlation between the determined CETP amount in the human<br>
plasma sample and the CETP activity of the plasma sample<br>
per se was investigated.<br>
CETP contents were determined by using the plasma<br>
without lipoproteins obtained in Example  as the assay<br>
sample. CETP activity was measured by using the same<br><br>
plasma sample with the CETP assay system of Example 1. The<br>
result is shown in Fig. 20.<br>
Since correlation coefficient(r) obtained was 0.953,<br>
the amount of CETP determined by the method of the present<br>
invention and the CETP activities of the same sample show<br>
good correlation. As a result, it was demonstrated that<br>
the assay system of the present invention has quite high<br>
precision.<br>
(Example 8) Determination of the human CETP in human<br>
plasma<br>
The amounts of CETP of from the healthy volunteers or<br>
various patients were determined by using the sandwich<br>
ELISA method established in Example .<br>
The CETP activity of the plasma was determined by<br>
using the donor lipoprotein([3H]CE~HDL3 which contains 6 ^g<br>
of CE) prepared similar to Example  and the acceptor<br>
lipoprotein (LDL which contains 600 yq of CE) prepared<br>
similar to Example <l-2> with the CETP assay system<br>
established in Example <l-3>.<br>
The human plasma used in the assay were plasma from<br>
the healthy volunteers (13), and patients of type Ha<br>
hyperlipidemia(5), type lib hyperlipidemia(5), CETP<br>
deficiency(2), LCAT deficiency(2), and hyperaplha-<br>
lipoproteinemia(l). Results are shown in Fig. 21.<br>
Any sample employed in the assay showed the good<br>
correlation between the amount of CETP determined and CETP<br>
activity. As expected, CETP was not detected in the plasma<br>
form the patients of CETP deficiency. Furthermore, it was<br>
demonstrated that the assay method of the present invention<br><br>
may be applied on not only the plasma from healthy<br>
volunteer but also the patients with various diseases.<br>
(Example 9) Comparison with the conventional determination<br>
method<br>
The following tests were performed to study the<br>
availability of the assay system of the present invention<br>
comparing with the conventional method which employs<br>
sandwich ELISA.<br>
In the conventional method, treatments by detergents<br>
such as TritonX-100 or heating is performed to expose<br>
epitopes capped by the interaction between protein-protein<br>
or protein-lipoprotein prior to the determination.<br>
However, such treatment causes denaturation of the proteins<br>
such as CETP in the sample, and the protein loses its<br>
higher-order structure to become inactivate biologically.<br>
Since CETP detected or determined by the conventional<br>
method was not an intact one, but denatured one, it was<br>
impossible to determine the accurate amount of CETP in the<br>
plasma.<br>
Accordingly, the followings were used as the sample in<br>
this determination.<br>
(1) the plasma from healthy volunteer without<br>
lipoprotein prepared as the same as Example <br>
(2) the plasma from healthy volunteer without<br>
lipoprotein incubated with 0.1 % Tween 20<br>
(3) the plasma from healthy volunteer without<br>
lipoprotein heated at 95°C for 5 minutes<br>
(4) the plasma from healthy volunteer without<br>
lipoprotein incubated with 1 % Tween 100<br><br>
The result was shown in Fig. 22.<br>
CETP was essentially detected in all samples, (1) to<br>
(4), however, it was not detected in both samples, (3) and<br>
(4). Particularly, no CETP was detected in (3).<br>
Furthermore, CETP activity was decreased more than 30 % in<br>
the plasma treated with the low concentration of Tween 20.<br>
Namely, intact CETP in the human plasma was not detected by<br>
using the conventional determination(assay) method which<br>
requires the detergent treatment or heating. However, it<br>
could be determined precisely by using the assay system of<br>
the present invention, since the monoclonal antibody has<br>
the specific reactivity for intact CETP in the human<br>
plasma. Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that the<br>
known monoclonal antibodies for the human CETP react<br>
specifically to the denatured human CETP, but not react to<br>
human intact CETP.<br>
(Example 10) Preparation of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions and their CETP inhibition activity<br>
The purified monoclonal antibodies, #72-1, #86-2, and<br>
#176-1 were dissolved in 10 ml of the distilled water for<br>
injections to prepare injections at the concentration of 50<br>
to 150 µg/wl.<br>
Anti-rabbit CETP monoclonal antibody was prepared<br>
similarly to Example 3 by using the purified rabbit CETP<br>
prepared in Example  as immunogen. Briefly, BALB/c<br>
mice(female, 4-5 weeks, Shizuoka Experimental Animal<br>
Center) was immunized with the immunogen to obtain two<br>
hybridoma #2-64 and #9-1, which produced anti-rabbit<br>
monoclonal antibody. Each hybridoma was transplanted into<br><br>
nude ICR mice(female, Charles River) to prepare anti-rabbit<br>
monoclonal antibodies from the ascites. The monoclonal<br>
antibodies obtained, #2-64 and #9-1 were both IgGl. The<br>
monoclonal antibody, #2-64 was dissolved into the distilled<br>
water for injections at the concentration of 0.13 mg/ml.<br>
The monoclonal antibody, #9-1, was at the concentration of<br>
5.53 mg/ml. Thus prepared injections containing either #2-<br>
64 or #9-1 was administrated into rabbit at the dose of 1.8<br>
mg/kg of body weight via i.v. The time of initial<br>
administration was time 0, and the monoclonal antibodies<br>
were administrated as the same dose in every 24 hr. Blood<br>
was sampled at 1, 2, 4 hr from the initial administration<br>
to obtain plasma.<br>
The CETP activities in the plasma thus obtained were<br>
determined by using the sandwich ELISA for the rabbit CETP<br>
determination method established with these monoclonal<br>
antibodies, #2-64 and #9-1, similarly to Example 1.<br>
It was demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies,<br>
#2-64 and #9-1, significantly inhibit CETP in rabbit<br>
plasma.<br>
(Example 11) Production of human CETP high expression<br>
transgenie mice<br>
The plasmid containing the cDNA encoding the human<br>
CETP was obtained as follows. A cDNA fragment encoding the<br>
human CETP was amplified by PCR with 5"-stretch cDNA<br>
library of human liver(Clonetech) as a template. The PCR<br>
products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis with<br>
the established known method. The cDNA fragment of<br>
interest was excised from the gel followed by ligation<br><br>
kit(Takara). The ligated plasmid was introduced into E.<br>
coli DH5 to obtain enough amount of plasmid to perform DNA<br>
sequencing. After sequencing, the human CETP cDNA was<br>
confirmed.<br>
cDNA encoding the human CETP obtained above was<br>
treated with DNA ligation kit(Takara), and inserted into a<br>
vector containing human ß-actin promoter(Mol. Cel.<br>
Immunol., 4:1961-1969(1984); ibid., 5:2720-2732(1985)) to<br>
obtain the plasmid, pCETP-1. By electroporation, pCETP-1<br>
was introduced into COS cells, and then obtained the RNA of<br>
transformed COS cells according to the known method. RT-<br>
PCR was performed by using the RNA to confirm the specific<br>
transcription of human CETP in COS cells introduced pCETP-<br>
1. Another transformant was produced similarly to the COS<br>
cells by using the expression vector pME 18S. The<br>
expression of human CETP in the trans formant was assayed by<br>
using the sandwich ELISA established in Example 7. In<br>
order to produce transgenic mice, the plasmid, pCETP-1 was<br>
enzymatically treated so as to linear.<br>
ICR white mice having vaginal plug(female, Japan Crea)<br>
were employed as foster mice, . This mouse was obtained by<br>
mating a female ICR mouse with a male ICR mouse with<br>
seminal duct ligation(Japan Crea). C57BL/6J mice(female,<br>
Japan Crea) were employed as mice for collection of embryo<br>
for human CETP gene transduction. This mouse was obtained<br>
by mating male C57BL/6J mouse with a female C57BL/6J mouse<br>
given both 5 unit of PEAMEX and the same unit of<br>
PUBEROGEN(both from Sankyo) for superovulation. After<br>
mating, oviducts were excised from the female C57BL/6J<br><br>
mouse to be treated with hyaluronidase to obtain embryo<br>
alone to store in media.<br>
Introduction of human CETP gene into the embryo was<br>
performed by using a manupilater under a microscope<br>
according to the known method. The embryo was retained by<br>
holding pipette at 37°C. The solution containing the<br>
linear gene of human CETP prepared before was introduced<br>
into male pronucleus of the embryo by using injection<br>
pipette.<br>
After introducing the gene, embryos holding normal<br>
condition were selected to be introduced into the oviducts<br>
of the tentative parent mouse, ICR white mouse.<br>
Tails of progeny mice from the parent mouse, which<br>
were hetero mice, were cut off to investigate whether the<br>
human CETP gene was introduced into the mouse genomic gene.<br>
By using PCR method, this introduction into the mouse<br>
genomic gene was confirmed, and the expression of the human<br>
CETP was also determined by using the sandwich ELISA<br>
established in Example 7.<br>
Mating two hetero mice described above, the transgenie<br>
mice which highly express human CETP was produced as homo<br>
mice.<br>
(Example 12) In vivo CETP inhibition of anti-CETP<br>
monoclonal antibody<br>
Two purified human anti-CETP monoclonal antibodies,<br>
#72-1 and #86-2 prepared in Example 3 was dissolved in the<br>
distilled water for injections at the ratio of<br>
concentration 29:1 to prepare injections, respectively.<br><br>
The prepared solution was administrated i.p. to 3 of<br>
the female transgenic mice produced in Example 11 at the<br>
dose of 100 mg/kg as single injection.. These mice were fed<br>
pellet type food for breeding freely for 4 months.<br>
Just before the antibody administration was time 0,<br>
and blood was sampled at the time, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hr from<br>
eyegrounds to separate plasma by centrifugation. The CETP<br>
activity in the plasma obtained(CETP inhibition activity by<br>
anti-human CETP antibody) was determined as the amount of<br>
CE transportation from HDL to LDL by using the CETP<br>
activity determination system established in Example 1.<br>
The result is shown in Fig. 24.<br>
It was confirmed that the monoclonal antibody of the<br>
present invention completely inhibit the human CETP<br>
activity in vivo. Furthermore, such inhibition effect for<br>
the human CETP activity in vivo was firstly clarified by<br>
this invention.<br>
(Example 13) Prevention of atherosclerosis by anti-CETP<br>
monoclonal antibody<br>
Two purified human anti-CETP monoclonal antibodies,<br>
#72-1 and #86-2 prepared in Example 3 was dissolved in the<br>
distilled water for injections at the ratio of<br>
concentration 29:1 to prepare injections, respectively.<br>
The prepared solution was administrated i.p. to 3 of<br>
the female transgenic mice produced in Example 11 at the<br>
dose of 75 mg/kg per injection for 4 days. These mice were<br>
fed pellet type food for breeding freely for 6 weeks.<br>
PBS(Phosphate buffered saline) was administrated to other<br>
mice as control.<br><br>
Just before the antibody administreition was time 0.<br>
Blood was sampled at the day -3, 2, 4, 3, and 11 from<br>
eyegrounds to separate plasma by centrifugation. The<br>
amounts of cholesterol in the plasma obtained was<br>
determined by using lipoprotein determination kit(Liquitec<br>
TC1/TC2, Boehringer Mannheim). For the fractionation of<br>
HDL, HDL cholesterol separation reagent(Boehringer<br>
Mannheim) was employed. The result is shown in Fig. 25.<br>
It was demonstrated that HDL cholesterol level in<br>
plasma was significantly enhanced when the anti-human CETP<br>
monoclonal antibody of the present invention was<br>
administrated in vivo. HDL was considered to be an<br>
important protein having anti-arteriosclerosis effect. In<br>
fact, it was showed that the development of atherosclerosis<br>
legion was inhibited or recessed by enhancement of HDL in<br>
plasma(J. Clin. Invest., 85:1234-1241(1990)).<br>
The observation that the administration of anti-human<br>
CETP antibody in vivo enhances the HDL cholesterol level in<br>
plasma was clarified at first by the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the result of the above-mentioned test<br>
revealed that the monoclonal antibody of the present<br>
invention was available for prevention and/or treatment of<br>
atherosclerosis.<br>
INDUSTRIAL UTILITY<br>
Since the anti-human CETP monoclonal antibody of the<br>
present invention has higher binding specificity(CETP<br>
inhibition activity) to human CETP, particularly intact<br>
CETP in the human body fluid such as plasma, the above-<br>
mentioned intact CETP per se may be determined convenient<br><br>
and highly sensitive. Such determination(assay) method has<br>
not been established before.<br>
Particularly, by using the above-mentioned<br>
characteristics of the any of three anti-human CETP<br>
monoclonal antibodies of the present invention, the intact<br>
CETP can be determined more convenient and sensitive when<br>
any of the two monoclonal antibodies described above in<br>
combination were employed in the sandwich ELISA.<br>
In the determination method employing the monoclonal<br>
antibody of the present invention, the amount of CETP in<br>
bodily fluid such as plasma is determined conveniently with<br>
high sensitivity without any pretreatment such as the<br>
detergent or heat treatment.<br>
Since the anti-human CETP monoclonal antibody of the<br>
present invention has excellent CETP inhibition activity,<br>
it was available as Pharmaceuticals for prevention and/or<br>
