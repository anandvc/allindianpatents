DESCRIPTION Protein involved in restoration of cytoplasmic male sterility to fertility and gene encoding the protein and gene.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a gene involved in restoration from cytoplasmic male sterility to fertility. More specifically, the present invention relates to the gene involved in restoration of cytoplasmic male sterility character (hereafter may be abbreviated to cms) used for developing a cultivar of a first filial hybrid (hereafter abbreviated to F1) , and a vector and a transformant containing the gene.<br>
Background Art<br>
As to crops such as cereal crops and vegetables, F1 cultivars are being actively developed with features such as 1) an agricultural genetic character improved excellently by heterosis, 2) an equal quality of harvests, and 3) protectability of a breeder's right on the basis of segregation of genetic characters in the next generation. Actually, F1 varieties of many major crops have gone into actual use.<br>
A method for seed production of an F1 cultivar is exemplified by cms/Rf seed production system comprising a cytoplasmic male sterile (cms) line and a line (hereafter may be abbreviated to Rf) for restoration from male sterility of thecultivar. For example, the method has been developed for cereals such as rice. Sorghum, and corn and an oil crop such as sunflower. These method have been developed by using a technique of breeding or cell fusion.<br>
For Brassicaceae, the system for F1 seed production by applying self-incompatibility is widely applied. For rapeseed showing unstable self-incompatibility, however, the system for F1 seed production requires use of the cms line and the Rf line.<br>
On the contrary, in recent years, a study has been conducted for using cytoplasmic male sterile line (Kosena cms) derived<br><br>
from Kosena radish and cytoplasmic male sterile line (Ogura cms) derived from Ogura radish for rapeseed. Both cms genes are encoded in a genome of mitochondria which is a cytoplasmic organelle, and their nucleotide sequences have been known. However, a molecular biological study using radish has not so developed and therefore, markers necessary for gene isolation have been seldom known. Thus, isolation of the gene from a nucleus is difficult. Therefore, introduction of the Rf gene has been achieved only for rapeseed by applying intergeneric crosses or cell fusion approaches to a radish line, of which fertility has been restored.<br>
Furthermore, for Rf gene, 1 or more restorer genes are present according to each cms line of different plant species. For radish, the presence of Rfl gene and Rf2 gene is necessary for restoration of fertility. In addition, it has been known that Rfl gene reduces remarkably the accumulation of ORF 125 protein (M. Iwabuchi et al. , PlantMol. Biol. 39: 183-188. 1999) in mitochondria which is known as a cms-associated protein of radish (Jpn. J. Breeding 47 (separate volume 1) : p. 186. 1997 and Jpn. J. Breeding 48 (separate volume 1): p. 197. 199S.)<br>
In rapeseed, it has been also known by gene analysis study that radish Rfl gene introduced by intrgeneric crosses or cell fusion reduces acu-uiTiU lation of ORF125 or ORF 138 protein (M. Grelon et al. , Mol. Gen. Genet. 243: 540-547,) which is known as the cms-associatedprotein, and that reductionof accumulation of these ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein coincides perfectly with fertility restoration phenomenon (N. Koizukaetal, Theor. Appl. Genet. 100: 949-955. 2000). The restoration of fertility of the male sterile line of rapeseed requires reduction of accumulation of the ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein. For this, Rfl gene is an important gene.<br>
However, concerning a nucleotide sequence of Rf genes, only Rf2 gene, which is a restorer gene for a T-cytoplasm which is one of maize cms, was identified and isolated. But no nucleotide sequence of Rf genes of other plant species has been<br><br>
known.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
It has been known that, the rapeseed restorer line in which Rfl gene derived from Ogura radish has been introduced by intergeneric hybridization or cell fusion, and the Fi cultivar created by using the line as a pollen parent, shows a higher content of glucosinolate (hereafter abbreviated to GSL) than the regulated value, thereby making a practical problem. This may be because the gene derived from radish which is involved in GSL biosynthesis is present around Rfl gene so as to make a tight genetic linkage and therefore the GSL content of the rapeseed restorer line (Rf line) increases. It has been known that GSL is contained in rapeseed expel and when given to an animal as a feed, it causes thyroid gland. Therefore, the GSL content of a rapeseed seed on a breeding stage is regulated to<br>
18 //mole/ g or lower in North America and 20 A/mole/ g or lower in Europe.<br>
Moreover, in recent years, a plant to which a function such as herbicide tolerance is added by gene recombination is being actively developed. For creating efficiently these plants, only the presence of the rapeseed restorer line yielded by breeding or cell fusion is insufficient, and isolation of Rf gene, particularly Rfl gene derived from radish, has been desired.<br>
Thus, a problem to be solved by the present invention is to isolate Rf gene, particularly Rfl gene derived from radish, and identify its structure. A further problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a means for establishing the rapeseed restorer line by using the Rf  gene isolated.<br>
As the result of the intensive study on solving the above problems, the present inventors successfully achieved the cloning of Rfl genes derived from rapeseed and radish, thereby solving the problems.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a protein involved<br><br>
in restoration from sterility of a cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility which has 14 or more pentatricopeptide repeat (hereafter may be abbreviated to PPR) motifs, wherein a group of the motifs is divided into 3 or more blocks, each of the individual blocks has at least 2 or more PPR motifs, and the block in a carboxyl terminal (C terminal) side has 4 PPR motifs.<br>

The Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will be described below in detail.<br>
(1) Embodiments of the protein of the present invention<br>
The protein of the present invention relates to any of proteins of (i) to (v) below:<br>
(i) a protein involved in restoration of a cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility which has 14 or more pentatricopeptide repeat (hereafter may be abbreviated to PPR) motifs, wherein a group of the motifs is divided into 3 or more blocks, each of the individual blocks has at least 2 or more PPR motifs, and the block in a carboxyl terminal (C terminal) side has 4 PPR motifs.<br>

In the present specification, the PPR motif is the '^pentatricopeptide repeat" motif. This PPR motif is a motif structure of a novel protein found in the course of an Arabidopsis genome project. The base motif thereof is that a sequence of 35 degenerated amino acids is repeated in tandem on a primary structure of the protein. The PPR motif has the sequence represented by amino terminal (N terminal) "VTYNTLISGYCKNGKLEEALELFEEMKEKGIKPDV" -carboxyl terminal (C terminal) as a consensus amino acid sequence. This motif is the proposed by Small and Peeters (reference: Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000, 25 46-47). In the year of the publication of the reference, about 200 genes capable of having this motif in the Arabidopsis genome were registered to a gene bank such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/index.html.) At present, possibility of presence of this motif structure in a certain protein can be easily determined by a program stored in Protein Families Database of Alignments and HMNs (hereafter abbreviated to Pfam;<br>
http://www.Sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/search.shtml) located in Sanger Institute, U.K.<br>
Up to now, there are following examples of proteins having<br><br>
the PPR motif of which function has been known: 1) Yeast PET309 and Neurospora crassa CYA-5 which are proteins translocating to mitochondria, interacts with coxl mRNA which is a mitochondrial gene to regulate coxl expression at a level of post-transcriptional processing or translation (Manthey and McEwen EMBO J 1995 14 4031, Coffin et al. Curr Genet 1997 32 273-280); and 2) Maize CRPl which is a PPR motif protein translocating to mitochondrion, is essential for translation of petA andpetD gene which is a chloroplast gene and also essential for a processing step of petD mRNA (Fisk et al, EMBO J 1999 18 2621-2630) Hence, the proteins having the PPR motif may highly probably contribute to translation regulation in some manner.<br>
At this time, the inventors have isolated a gene involved in restoration of a cytoplasmic male sterile individual of Kosena radish to fertility, and have found that the protein encoded thereby has 14 or more pentatricopeptide repeat (hereafter abbreviated to PPR) motifs, the PPR motif group is divided into 3 or more blocks, each of the individual blocks has at least 2 or more PPR motifs, and the block located in a position nearest to the carboxyl terminal (C terminal) has 4 PPR motifs.<br>
The above mentioned protein involved in restoration of a cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility is preferably one wherein the number of PPR motifs is 14 to 16, and more preferably one wherein the PPR motif group is divided into 3 blocks and each block has 5, 7, and 4 PPR motifs in the order from an amino terminal (N terminal).<br>
Specifically, the protein comprises:<br>
(1)	PPR cluster #1: the PPR cluster in which the first to fifth PPR motifs from the N terminal comprises consecutive 175 residues;<br>
(2)	PPR cluster #2: the PPR cluster in which the sixth to 12th PPR motifs from the N terminal comprises consecutive 245 residues;<br>
(3)	PPR cluster #3: the PPR cluster in which the 13th to 16th PPR motifs from the N terminal comprises consecutive 140<br><br>
residues.<br>
More preferably, the fourth amino acid, which is present in the second PPR motif from the amino terminal (N terminal) side, is an amino acid other than serine , threonine, or cysteine . More preferably, the fourth amino acid, which is present in the second PPR motif from the amino terminal (N terminal) side, is any of asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or histidine. Particularly preferably, the fourth amino acid, which is present in the second PPR motif from the amino terminal<br>
(N terminal) side, is asparagine.<br>
It has been known that normally, fertility restorer gene is present in a nuclear genome and the cytoplasmic male sterile gene is present in the mitochondria. Therefore, the above protein involved in restoration of the cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility preferably further has a signal peptide sequence for the translocation to the mitochondrion in the amino terminal or has a sequence of Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu in the carboxyl terminal.<br>
The signal peptide sequence at the N terminal for the translocation to the mitochondra is exemplified by those confirmed   by   a      prediction   program   "TargetP"<br>
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/) or the predicion program "^Psort" (http: //psort. nibb .ac.jp/) based on an algorithmof 0. Emanuelsson (J. Mol. Biol. 300, 1005-1016. 2000) . Example of the signal peptide include the signal peptide<br>
(MetAlaPheArgGlnThrLeuSerlleArgSerArgLeuPheAlaArgArgAsnGlnP roValTyrHisIlelleProArgGluSerAspHisGluArgAsp) of AtOXAl gene<br>
of Arabidopsis thaliana (W. Sakamoto et al. : Plant Cell Physiol. 41: 1157-1163.) Among these peptides, a preferable amino acid sequence is exemplified by the sequence of 1st to 79th amino acids in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 , and particularly preferably, the sequence of 1st to 34th amino acids in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.3.<br>
The protein according to the present invention which is involved in restoration of the cytoplasmic male sterile<br><br>
individual to fertility is bound to the transcription product of the cytoplasmic male sterile gene so as to cause an inhibition of translation of the cytoplasmic male sterile gene, thereby achieving restoration of the cytoplasmicmale sterile individual to fertility.<br>
Examples of the transcriptional product of the cytoplasmic male sterile gene include the transcriptional product (mRNA) of each gene of ORF125 which is a causal protein causing Kosena cytoplasmic male sterilityor ORF138 which is the causal protein causing Ogura cytoplasmic male sterility. Preferred examples include 5'-UTR (Bonhomme et al. ; Mol. Gen. Genet. 235: 340-348. 1992) region of the gene.<br>
Examples of the methods for confirming the binding to the transcriptional product of the cytoplasmic male sterile gene include a method in which the protein according to the present invention is added to mRNA of orfl25 or orfl38 which was artificially transcribed in vitro, followed by electrophoresis, so-called gel shift method. Practical operation may be carried out under a condition commonly applied as the gel shift method.<br>

(3) Method for obtaining DNA of the present invention<br>
A method for obtaining DNA of the present invention is not particularly limited. On the basis of information of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO.l or SEQ ID NO.2 disclosed in the present specification, and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 or the PPR motif obtained based on the information of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 , and the amino acid sequence obtained by combining a mitochondrial transit sequence, DNA of the present invention can be isolated or synthesized by applying<br><br>
a common breeding technique and a common genetic engineering technique which are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Specifically, DNA of the present invention can be obtained from an appropriate plant origin in which the gene of the present invention is expressed, specifically a Raphanus plant including a cultivar and a relative species of radish, or other plants to which the genomic DNA containing the restorer gene is introduced from these plants by crossing or cell fusion techniques, more specifically Raphanus plants such as Kosena radish, Ogura radish, Yuanhong radish or cultivars derived from those radishes and relative species of these radish cultivars or Brassica plants to which the genomic DNA containing the cytoplasmic male sterility restorer gene of these plant species and cultivars is introduced from these plants by crossing or cell fusion techniques. The gene of the present invention can be isolated and obtained, for example, by isolating DNA markers locating around an Rf gene, preparing a genome map indicating a relationship between genetic distances of these DNA markers and the Rf gene, and applying positional cloning method (also called chromosome walking) of an Rf region while starting from the genome map.<br>
This technique is started from finding an appropriate DNA marker on a genomic DNA and preparing the genome map by measuring the genetic distance of the Rf gene and the DNA markers. For the DNA markers which generally has some lOObp length, the genome derived from a father should be distinguished from the genome derived from a mother. The DNA marker should localize a same chromosome as that of the gene, and markers of which a mode of inheritance is almost same as that of the gene due to a small distance from the gene, that is, a marker having a genetically tight linkage, is more desirable.<br>
As method for isolating the DNA marker, RFLP method has been frequently used so far, however, simple and convenient methods such as RAPD method and AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) method which use PCR, are recently used (Nucleic<br><br>
Acids Research, 1995, Vol. 23, NO. 21: 4 407-4414) . Particularly, AFLP method is effective means for obtaining the marker having the genetically tight linkage. As a material for measuring the genetic distance from the marker, there is normally used an F2 population obtained by self pollination of an F] generation produced by crossing a recessive homozygous individual lacking the Rfl gene with a dominant homozygous individual having homozygous Rfl genes, and BCi population obtained by crossing the Fi generation with the recessive homozygous plant, which is the parent thereof, lacking a gene of interest.<br>
As the recessive homozygous individual as described above, the Raphanus plants including the cultivar and the relative species of radish of the cytoplasmic male sterile line, more specifically Kosena radish and Ogura radish of the cytoplasmic male sterile line, or Brassica plants to which the cytoplasmic male sterility derived from Kosena radish (Kosena cms) and the cytoplasmic male sterility derived from Ogura radish (Ogura cms) have beenintroduced, more specifically cms rapeseed can be used.<br>
As the dominant homozygous plant described above, the Raphanus plants including the cultivar and the relative species of radish of the Rf line, more specifically Brassica plants, to which the genomic DNA containing the cytoplasmic male fertility restoration gene of Raphanus plants including Kosena radish, Ogura radish, Yuanhong radish or cultivars and relative species of these radish clutivars, which are the cytoplasmic male sterile line, has been introduced by crossing or cell fusion techniques, more specifically Rf rapeseed can be used.<br>
For analysis of the F2 population obtained by self pollination of the Fi generation obtained by crossing of these parents and the BCi population obtained by crossing the F: generation with the recessive homozygous plant, normally 100 individuals or more and more preferably 1000 individuals or more are desirably used. The number of the individuals used as many as possible make accuracy of the genome map higher and a physical distance from the DNA marker to a gene of interest becomes short.<br><br>
Similarly in case of the Rf gene, the DNA marker having a shorter physical distance can be obtained.<br>
As the material for the measurement of the genetic distance of the DNA marker from the Rf gene, for example, there can be used F2 population of some thousand individuals which is obtained by self pollination of the radish Fi generation produced by crossing of Kosena radish {Raphanus sativus cv. Kosena) of the cms line with Yuanhong radish (Raphanus sativus cv. Yuanhong) of the Rf line according to the method described in N. Koizuka et al. (Teor. Appl. Genet. 100: 949-955, 2000). Analysis of these populations allows isolation of the DNA markers with a linkage in a form sandwiching the Rf gene and located in a position with a distance of about 0.2 cM from both sides thereof. By this step, the genome map as shown in Fig. 1, which shows the genetic distance of the marker from the Rf gene can be prepared.<br>
Subsequent to preparation of the genome map, the genomic DNA which corresponds to its position should be cloned to combine between DNA markers sandwiching the objective gene. Normally, the physical distance between DNA markers and the objective gene is large and hence, combination of a plurality of clones having genomic DNA fragments allows covering a region from the DNA marker to the objective gene. A step to combine these DNA markers by using the clone having genomic DNA fragments is preparation of contig. For the Rf gene, contig can be similarly prepared by combining these DNA markers which is located in the position nearer the Rf gene by using a plurality of clones having genomic DNA fragments, so as to cover "the Rf  gene region.<br>
A collection of clones having genomic DNA fragments can be obtainedby preparing a genomic library. Normally, some kinds of vectors are used according to the length of the genomic DNA which can be cloned. Examples include those constructed by using a lambda phage vector which can clone a fragment having the length up to about 20 kb, a cosmid vector which can clone a fragment having a relatively long (up to 40 kb) length, a BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) vector which can clone a fragment having<br><br>
a longer (100 or more kb) length.<br>
In any of libraries , it is important that a value produced bymultiplyinga number of populations of the library to an average length of the fragment cloned becomes the value 4 to 5 times a full length (genome size) of the genome supplied to the library. The genome size of radish may be about 500 Mbp and therefore, in case of the lambda phage vector having the average length of 20 kb, the number of population becomes 1.0 x 105 to 1.25 X 105 and in case of the cosmid library having the average length of 40 kb, the number of population becomes 5.0 x 104 to 6,25 X lO4. The genome size of rapeseed is thought to be about 1000 Mbp and therefore, in case of the lambda phage vector having the average length of 20 kb, the number of population becomes 2.0 X 10^ to 2 . 5 X 10^, and in case of the cosmid library having the average length of 4 0 kb, the number of population becomes 1.0 X 10 to 1.25 X 10<br>
For the genomic DNA supplied to the library, the genomic DNA may be extracted from a living organism containing the objective gene by an ordinary method. In case of the Rf gene, there can be used the Raphanus plant including the cultivar and the relative species of radish of the Rf line, more specifically Brassica plants, to which the genomic DNA containing the cytoplasmic male fertility restorer gene of Raphanus plants including Kosena radish, Ogura radish, Yuanhong radish or varieties and relative species of these radish varieties, which are the cytoplasmic male sterile line, has been introduced by crossing or cell fusion techniques , more specif icallyK/rapeseed. Generally, it may be most preferable to extract the genomic DNA from the same Rf line plant as the parent plant used for preparation of the F2 population and the BCi population so as to prepare the genomic library. The genomic DNA can be prepared according to such ordinary method as CTAB method (Murray, M. G. and Thompson, W. F. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res. 8: 4321)<br>
For the preparation of contig, the clone having DNA marker which is located in both sides of the Rf gene is first isolated.<br><br>
Isolation is carried out from the genomic library by the ordinary method using plaque hybridization method in case of a lambda phage library and by using colony hybridization method in case of cosmid library and BAC library. Next, using a terminal region of the clone isolated as an index, contig is prepared by isolating the clone located in an adjacent position of the clone. After preparation, the nucleotide sequence of the contig is determined by the ordinary method.<br>
From the development of a genome project in recent years, a technique for presuming a functional gene on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the genomic DNA has been advanced. A gene discovery program represented by "Genscan" can presume the gene in a considerable probability. In addition, a homology search program represented by 'BLAST" can presume similarity to other genes and proteins. Using these analytical programs, presumption and isolation of the objective gene are carried out. In the case of Rf gene, similarly, the genomic DNA sequence of the contig can be isolated and identified by using a similar analytical software. Such analysis reveals a promoter region on a genomic DNA nucleotide sequence, a structural gene region containing an intron, and a terminator region. Also, concerning the structural gene containing the intron, the gene in a form which is translated into a protein from which the intron has been excluded and the amino acid sequence corresponding to the gene are clearly indicated. In such manner, the Rf gene on the contig can be presumed in a considerable probability.<br>
Moreover, on the basis of the gene sequence presumed by using the analytical programs as described above, the actual form of in vivo expression of the obj ective genome can be confirmed by purifying an mRNA and isolating complementary DNA (cDNA) corresponding thereto. A starting site of transcription is conveniently confirmed by analysis applying easy 5 ' -RACE method employing PCR and more reliably, primer extension method and SI mapping method.<br>

Alternatively, a positive clone itself having the sequence as described above can be used as the probe.<br>
Obtaining the gene of the present invention may be carried out in combination of techniques ordinary used for isolation of the gene, such as DNA and RNA amplification technique by PCR method and the RACE method represented by 5'-RACE method.<br>

By using partial or all nucleotide sequence of the gene of the present invention obtained by such procedure, the presence<br><br>
of the gene of the present invention and the occurrence of expression thereof in an individual or various tissues can be characteristically detected.<br>
As described above, the gene of the present invention is exemplified by DNA encoding an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO. 17, or SEQ ID NO. 19, but is not limited thereto. Homologues of the gene are included in the present invention.<br>

Similarly, the gene can have not only a specific nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO. 15 or SEQ ID NO. 16, but also can have the nucleotide sequence selected by combining with an optional codon corresponding to individual amino acid residues shown by SEQ ID NO.17.

(5) Method for obtaining the protein of the present invention The method for obtaining the protein of the present invention is not particularly limited. On the basis of information obtained by combining the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO. 17 or SEQ ID NO. 19 disclosed in the present specification or the PPR motif or the mitochondria transit sequence obtained on the basis of information of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO. 17 or SEQ ID NO. 19, the protein of the present invention can be isolated, expressed or synthesized by applying the general genetic engineering technique known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, the protein of the present invention can be expressed by isolating or synthesizing DNA encoding a protein<br><br>
of the present invention and introducing it into cell.<br>
The protein of the present invention can be obtained by, for example , culturinga transformant havinga gene of the present invention, producing and accumulating the protein of the present invention in the culture, and collecting the protein from the culture.<br>
The method for culturing a transformant having a gene of the present invention can be carried out according to an ordinary method used for culturing the host.<br>
In the case where the transformant of the present invention is a procaryote such as Escherichia coli or an eucaryote such as yeast, a culture medium for culturing these microorganisms may be either of natural medium or synthetic medium, so long as these culture media contains a carbon source, nitrogen source, inorganic salts which can be used by these microorganisms, and can realizes an efficient culturing of the transformant. Culturing is preferably carried out under an aerobic condition such as a shaking culture or an aerated and agitated submerged<br>
culture, a culture temperature ranges normally from 15 to 40 "C, and culture duration time ranges normally from 16 hours to 7 days. The pH during the culture is kept ranging from 3.0 to 9.0. pH adjustment is carried out by using an inorganic or organic acid, an alkali solution, urea, calcium carbonate, ammonium or the like. Further, if necessary during culturing, an antibiotic such as Ampicillin or tetracycline may be added to the culture medium.<br>
As the culture medium for culturing the transformant obtained by using the animal cell as the host cell, there is used RPM11640 medium which is commonly used (The Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, 199, 519 (1967) , Eagle ' sMEMmedium (Science, 122, 501 (1952) ) , DMEMmedium (Virology, 8, 396 (1959) ) , 199 mediiim (Proceeding of the Society for the Biological Medicine, 73, 1 (1950)) , or the medium prepared by adding bovine fetus serum to any one of these media. Culturing is normally conducted under the condition of pH ranging from 6 to 8, a temperature<br><br>
ranging from 30 to 40oC, 5% CO2 for 1 to 7 days. Moreover, if necessary during culture, an antibiotic such as kanamycin or Penicillin may de added to the culture medium.<br>
As the culture medium for transformant obtained by using the plant cell as the host cell, there is used any medium such as MS medium, R2P medium and others, which are commonly used in accordance with plant species .  Culturing is carried out for<br>
1 to 21 days under the condition of pH 6 to 8 and 15 to 35°C. If necessary during culture, an antibiotic such as kanamycin or hygromycin may be added to the culture medium.<br>
In order to isolate and purify the protein of the present invention which is involved in restoration of cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility from a cultured product of the transformant, ordinary isolation and purification methods may be used.<br>
For example, when the protein of the present invention is expressed intracellularly in a dissolving state, after completion of culturing, the cells are collected by centrifugation and suspended in an aqueous buffer solution and then, the cells are broken by using an ultrasonic breaking machine , a French press, Manton Gaulin homogenizer, Dynomill to obtain a cell free extract solution. From a supernatant obtained by centrifugation of the cell free extract solution, a purified sample product can be obtained by using an ordinary protein isolation and purification method, such as solvent extraction method, salting-out method using ammonium sulfate and the like, desalination method, precipitation method using an organic solvent, anion exchange chromatography method using such resin as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) Sepharose or DIAION HPA-75 (Mitsubishi Chemical Corp), cation exchange chromatography method using S-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), hydrophobic chromatography method using such resin as butyl Sepharose or phenyl Sepharose, gel filtration method using a molecular sieve, affinity chromatography method, chromatofocusing method, and electrophoretic  method  such  as  isoelectric  focusing.<br><br>
independently or in combination.<br>
In the case where the protein is intracellularly expressed with forming an insoluble matter, the protein is collected from a fraction of precipitation which is obtained by collecting, destroyiong and centrifuging cells similarly, by an ordinary method. Then, the insoluble matter of the protein is solubilized by a protein-denaturing agent. A solution of the solubilized protein is diluted or dialyzed by a solution which lacks the protein-denaturing agent or contains the protein-denaturing agent at such a low concentration that the protein denaturation does not occur, so as to construct a normal stereoscopic structure of the protein. Then, a purified sample product can be obtained by the same isolation and purification method as those described above.<br>
In the case where the protein of the present invention or its derivative such as sugar-modified molecule is extracellularly secreted, the protein or derivative such as the sugar chain-added molecule can be collected in the supernatant of the culture. The solubilized fraction is obtained by treating the culture product by techniques such as centrifugation as described above, and the purified sample product can be obtained from the solubilized fraction by using the isolation and purification method as described above.<br>
The protein of the present invention can also be produced by such chemical synthesis method as Fmoc (fluorenyl methyl oxycarbonyl) method or tBoc (t-butyl oxycarbonyl) method. Further, synthesis can be performed by using a peptide synthesizer commercially available from Souwa Boueki (Advanced Chemtech, USA) , Perkin Elmer Japan (Perkin Elmer, USA) , Amerciam Pharmacia Biotech (Amerciam Pharmacia Biotech) , Aroca (Protein Technology Instrument, USA) , Kurabou (Synthecell-Vega, USA) , Japan PerSeptive Ltd.

In this vector, 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus is used as the promoter, and the terminator of nopaline synthesis enzyme, which is present in Ti plasmid of A, tumefacience, is used as the terminator. As the promoter necessary for expression, not only the above described 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus, but also rbcS promoter widely present in plants may be used. More preferably, a promoter such as TA29 promoter which is expressed in a developing period of pollens, and further preferably authentic promoters located in the upstream of the genes, are used. As the terminator, not only the above described terminator of nopaline synthesis enzyme, but also 35S terminator of cauliflower mosaic virus can be used. More preferably, an authentic terminator located in the downstream of the gene is used.<br>
In the case where the above DNA of SEQ ID NO. 2 or 238th to 2064th nucleotides thereof, DNA of SEQ ID NO. 16 or 238th to 2064th nucleotides thereof, DNA of SEQ ID NO. 18 or 244th to 2073th nucleotides thereof, or DNA encoding a protein of SEQ ID NO. 3 or a region of 80th to 687th residues thereof, SEQ ID NO.17 or a region of 80th to 687th residues thereof, or SEQ ID NO. 19 or a region of 82th to 690th residues thereof is used for the purpose of restoration of cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility, a mitochondrial transit sequence is necessary in addition to these sequences.<br>

In the following examples, the present inventors have prepared the vectors for plant transformation in order to introduce the DNA (SEQ ID NO.l) of the Rf gene which contains introns contained in regions from the authentic promoter present in the genome to the terminator, to the plant in an authentic form. After cleavage of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO.l from the clone composing a part of the contig by a restriction enzyme, the sequence was subcloned into an appropriate cloning vector. Then, the subcloned fragment was introduced into the vector pKM424 and pBIGRZ2 for plant transformation to obtain the vector which can introduce the fragment into the plant. This vector was introduced into Agrobacterium for plant transformation . By infectingAgrobacteriu/nholdingthis vector to the plant, the DNA fragment is integrated into a plant genome.<br>
The plant to which the gene of the present invention can be applied is exemplified by oil crop such as rapeseed, sunflower, soybean and palm, cereals such as rice, maize and wheat, flowering plants such as tobacco and petunia, and various vegetables such as tomato, broccoli, cabbage, Chinese cabbage and carrot.<br>
Among these, Brasslca plants such as rapeseed, cabbage, Chinese cabbage and broccoli, and tomato are preferable. Rapeseed, cabbage, Chinese cabbage andbroccoli are particularly preferable, and rapeseed is most preferable.<br>
In the present specification, the plant source for transformation is exemplified by a seed, a germ, a shoot, a callus , a cultured cell, and a plant body. For example, the germ or a protoplast in case of rapeseed; the seedling, the callus or the cultured cell in case of soybean; the seedling in case of sunflower; the callus or the cultured cell in case of palm; the seedling, the callus, the cultured cell or the protoplast in case of rice; the seedling, the shoot, the callus, the cultured cell or the protoplast in case of maize; the seedling, the callus or the cultured cell in case of wheat; the seedling, the callus, the cultured cell or the protoplast in case of cabbage and<br><br>
broccoli; the seedling, the callus, the cultured cell or the protoplast in case of carrot. Preferred portions are appropriately selected depending on the subject plant, as those skilled in the art ordinarily perform.<br>
Transformation of plant can be conducted by ordinary ways . For example , there are the method in that the vector is introduced into the plant by infecting a plant cell with Agrobacterium after the vector is once introduced to an Agrojbacteriu/n cell, and the method in that the vector is directly introduced into the cell by using, for example, electroporation method, DEAE dextran method, calcium phosphate method, polyethylene glycol method, and particle gun method.<br>
For example, the preferred method for introducing a gene in the case of rapeseed is exemplified by the method described below.<br>
A hypocotyl of a form of rapeseed aseptically germinated in the MS medium containing a sugar such as sucrose as the carbon source is precultured on the MS medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid and sucrose. Agrobacterium grown on YEB medium is collected by centrifugation and is suspended again on the MS medium containing sucrose. The above described hypocotyl of rapeseed is added in this suspension followed by shaking. Then, the hypocotyl taken out is returned to the original preculture medium for co-culture for 3 days followed by transfer to a selection medium containing plant hormones such as Zeatinandbenzylaminopurine, and carbenicillin and kanamycin for selection. A regenerated individual is obtained by culturing the obtained regenerated green buds in a growth culture medium optionally containing a plant hormone such as benzylaminopurine and then in a rooting culture medium optionally containing plant hormones such as naphthalene acetic acid and benzylaminopurine. By crossing this individual with the individual of the cms line, Fi hybrid of which fertility has been restored can be obtained.<br>
The introduction of DNA of the present invention into<br><br>
the plant can enable restoration of cytoplasmic male sterile individual to fertility.<br>
For the regenerated plant as described above, expression can be confirmed by crossing it with rapeseed of the cms line and examining fertility of offspring thereof . In the case where transformation is conducted using a rapeseed plant having the cms character as a material, pollen fertility can be examined by transferring the transformant (regenerated individual), which has produced a root by the way described above, to soil containing an ordinary fertilizer to flower. This procedure is preferable in view of temporal and operational convenience.<br>
In the above trans formant, in the case where trans formation is conducted as described above using the cell or the tissue, preferably the hypocotyle, a cotyledon, a leaf, a pollen, the cultured cell, the callus, and the protoplast of rapeseed plant which has cms cytoplasm as the cell source, the plant of which pollen fertility has been restored can be obtained by transferring the plant (regenerated individual) which has produced by the above method to soil containing the ordinary fertilizer to flower.<br>
The plant body in which the DNA has been integrated in the nucleus can be obtained by introducing the DNA of the present invention into the cms cell by the gene introducing method as described above using the cms cell, selecting the cell in which the DNA is integrated in the nucleus using a selection marker of tolerance against an antibiotic such as kanamycin or tolerance to herbicide as an index, and then culturing the cell in the growth culture medium or the rooting culture medium as described above . In this plant body, fertility is restored from the male sterile character.<br>
For detecting the gene involved in restoration to fertility, the applicable method is that 15 to 50mer oligonucleotide primer freely designed from the DNA of any of claims 1 to 4 or probe of at least 15 mer consisting of all or a part of the DNA of any of claims 1 to 4 is used, and the quantity of the nucleotide<br><br>
sequence amplifiedby the primer or the quantity of the nucleotide sequence detected by the probe in an organism sample of interest is confirmed to be 1 gene or more in 1 genome.<br>
Specific technique for confirmation is exemplified by PCR method and Southern hybridization method, and among them, PCR method is preferable. These techniques can be conducted according to the method described in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989 (hereafter abbreviated to Molecular Cloning 2nd Ed.)<br>
For confirming that there is 1 gene or more in 1 genome, by applying PCR method, it is necessary that as a simplified technique, a same degree of amplification can be observed by using a same number of copy of the DNA as a template. More accurately, in the same biological sample of a same amount, the quantity of this amplified known gene is compared with the quantity of the nucleotide sequence amplifiedby using the primer by applying quantitative PCR method using an optional primer for amplifying a known gene as an internal standard in which 1 gene presents in 1 genome. In Southern hybridization method, the DNA of the plant of the fertility-restorer line in which 1 gene present in 1 genome is compared with the DNA of the objective plant sample at an equal amount, and then it is tested that the quantities of the DNAs detected are same or larger.<br>
The primer used in PCR method is exemplified by the 15 to 50mer oligonucleotide identical or having complementation to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO.l or SEQ ID NO. 2.<br>
The probe used in Southern hybridization method is exemplified by a total region of a double strand DNA identical to the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO.l or SEQ ID NO. 2, or a part of at least 15mer or more thereof, or the total region of a single strand DNA or a complementary strand thereof,or a part of at least 15mer or more thereof. Moreover, DNA having a certain or higher degree of homology to the nucleotide sequence of the DNA which is used as the probe as mentioned above may be used.<br><br>
The certain or higher degree of homology used hereby is, for example 70% or higher, preferably 80% or higher, more preferably 90% or higher, further preferably 93% or higher, particularly preferably 95% or higher, and most preferably 97% or higher. The DNA having the certain or higher degree of homology includes both of the polynucleotide having homology described above and the polynucleotide of the complementary strand thereof.<br>
The method for detection of the gene as described above can be applied as means of not only confirmation of integration of the DNA into the transformant, but also confirmation of presence of the Rf gene in the individual to which introduction of the Rf gene is attempted by crossing. By using this method, the presence of the Rf gene can be confirmed before flowering, in the case where the Rf gene is introduced into the cytoplasmic male sterile individual. In the case where the Rf gene is introduced to the plant having an ordinary cytoplasm, fertility of the individual of the next generation obtained by crossing the pollen in a flowering stage with the cytoplasmic male sterile individual should be confirmed, but the presence of the Rf gene can be confirmed before this step by using the present method. Such method of use is generally called use of a marker DNA or marker DNA breeding. The Rf gene may be used as the marker DNA of the Rf gene (rf marker) . The Rf marker is , as described above, important for breeding a commercial plant variety by using a recombinant to which the DNA has been introduced, and a non-recombinant plant to which the Rf gene has been introduced by crossing, as a mother plant.<br>
Whether or not the introduced DNA works as Rf gene can be confirmed by confirming restoration of fertility of the transformant as mentioned above, and also by the method presented below.<br>
As described above, the Rf gene restores fertility of the plant body by reducing an amount of ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein being the cms-associated protein, which is accumulated in the mitochondria.  Therefore, by confirming the reduction of the<br><br>
amount of ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein accumulated in the mitochondria of the transformant, it can be confirmed that the introduced gene is the Rf  gene.<br>
The method for confirming the reduction of the amount of ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein accumulated in the mitochondria is, for example, a method of confirming that the hybridizing signal amount of an antibody against the protein derived from a mitochondrial genome used as the internal standard, such as anti F1-F0 ATPase (hereafter abbreviated to ATPA) described in N. Koizuka et al. Theor Appl Genet, 100: 949-955, 2000, is equal between the cytoplasmic male sterile individual and the transformant in which the DNA has been introduced to the fertility-restored plant or the cytoplasmic male sterile individual, when ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein is detected by Western blotting method according to the condition described in the present specification, and that the amount accumulated in the transformant produced by introducing the DNA to the fertility-restored plant or the cytoplasmic male sterile individual has been reduced by more than 50%, preferably 60% or more, more preferably 80% or more as compared with the amount of ORF 125 or ORF 138 protein accumulated in the cytoplasmic male sterile individual.<br>
Practically, in a flower bud of the cytoplasmic male sterile radish plant having ORF 125, when the fertility-restorer gene Rf is introduced, the amount of ORF 125 protein accumulated is reduced markedly resulting in almost no detection. In rapeseed, in a flower bud of the fertility-restored rapeseed plant in which the fertility-restorer gene has been introduced to the cytoplasmic male sterile rapeseed which has the ORF 125 by crossing, it has been observed that the amount of ORF 125 protein accumulated is reduced by 80% or more. In the example, in the flower bud of the transformant rapeseed in which the gene has been introduced to the cytoplasmic male sterile individual, it has been observed that the amount of ORF 125 protein accumulated is reduced by 80% or more.<br><br>
The antibody against ORF 125 and ORF 138 protein in the method as described above can be obtained by the following common technique. These proteins are immunized to an animal as an antigen to obtain an antiserum, and immunogloburin G antibody can be purified by using protein A-bound affinity column. The antigen to be used can be obtained by purifying the protein from the cytoplasmic male sterile individual which expresses it and the cultured cell by an ordinary method. In addition, the antigen is also obtained by combinging ORF 125 and ORF 138 genes to the expression vector to express it in Escherichia coli and yeast followed by purification in the similar way. Moreover, the peptide obtained by chemically synthesizing a full length or a part of ORF 125 and ORF 138 can be used as the antigen. The antibody against ATPA can also be obtained by the similar technique.<br>
Further, by introducing a part or all of the gene of the present invention to the cell having a cms cytoplasm and/or the DNA of the present invention together with the induction promoter, the expression of cms can be regulated specifically and temporarily, and thus a new hybrid seed production system which need not a male sterility-maintaining line (maintainer) and/or restorer line (Rf line) necessary for hybrid seed production can be produced.<br>
That is, rapeseed of the cms line is normally sterile and thus, propagation and maintenance of the cms line requires the maintainer in which cms and Rf are not involved. Therefore, so far, production of a hybrid seed required plants of 3 lines, namely, the Rf line, the cms line, and the maintainer. However, because Rf gene was isolated and identified by the present invention and hence, applying the method for conducting induction of the promoter by a chemical substance in hybrid production so as to regulate expression of the restorer gene allows construction of the cms line capable of propagation and maintenance even without the maintainer.<br>
Specifically, a full length or a part of the gene of the<br><br>
present invention is integrated into a vector having the promoter induced from outside, for example, the drug sensitive promoter, in an antisense or a sense direction or is constructed vector to induce gene silencing with the inducible promoter. Then, the cell having the cms cytoplasm and DNA of the present invention or having the cms cytoplasm alone is transformed by using the vector.<br>
The cell having the cms cytoplasm and/or DNA of the present invention may be not only the cell obtained by transforming a cell having the cms cytoplasm with DNA of the present invention by the method as described above, but also the cell obtained by crossing the cms line with the Rf line.<br>
The inducible promoter described above is known, for example, from Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 6-46697 , and the method for preparation of the vector and transformation is exemplified by the techniques similar to those described above.<br>
The promoter is not induced usually in the transformant, which is the cell obtained by the method as described above, has the cms cytoplasm, and has or has not DNA of the present invention, and to which a part or all of DNA of the present invention is integrated together with the induction promoter. Therefore, the plant which carry the vector designed for up-regulation above described gene shows fertility when the induction is applied or the plant which carry the vector designed for down-regulation of the gene shows fertility caused by the inhibition of the endogenous Rf gene expression, and maintenance of the line can be carried out by self pollination. In the production of the hybrid, the chemical substance having an ability of inducing the promoter is acted on the plant which carry a vector can downregulate the endogenous Rf gene and thus, expression of the Rf gene is inhibited. Thus, the plant becomes male sterile and hence, can be used as the cms line in the production of the hybrid seed. Futhermore, when the cms line having both the endogenous Rf  gene and the downregulation<br><br>
construct, Rf line so far required for hybrid seed production is not needed. Therefore, every rapeseed cultivars or lines without Rf gene can be used as pollen donor (father) . Thus in addition to the unnecessary of the maintainer, the Rf line becomes unnecessary and a production cost can be reduced considerably.<br>
Applying these methods allow propagation and maintenance by self pollination even in the cms line. Consequently, though 3 lines are so far required for production of the hybrid seed, it becomes possible that the maintainer becomes unnecessary and a production cost can be reduced considerably.<br>
The contents disclosed in each specification of Japanese Patent Application Nos. 2001-128008, 2001-202082 and 2002-20083 , baaed on which the present application claims priorities, should be understood to be incorporated in the present specification by reference.<br>
Examples of the present invention are given below in detail, but the following examples are in no way intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Isolation of DNA marker which is linked with the cytoplasmic male fertility restorer gene, and preparation of the genome map<br>
For isolation of the fertility restorer gene (Rf gene), it is first necessary to isolate the DNA marker located around the Rf gene and prepare the genome map showing a relationship between genetic distances of this DNA marker and Rf gene. As the starting point, positional cloning of anRf region was carried out.<br>
As the method for isolating the DNA marker, AFLP was carried out by using AFLP Analysis System I AFLP Starter Kit of GIBCO BRL for AFLP (Amplified fragment length polymorphism) method (Nucleic Acids Research, 1995, Vol. 23, NO.21 4407-4414) . As the material used for measuring the genetic distance from the marker, F2 population of about 2100 individuals which were<br><br>
obtained by self pollination of eight individuals of radish F1 generation produced by crossing one individual ((KC2/ KA1)-1) of Raphanus sativus cv . Kosena of the cms line with one individual (YuanlO-3) of Raphanus sativus cv. Yuanhong according to the method described in N. Koizuka, et al. , Theor Appl Genet, 100:949-955 2000, was used. As a result, in a form sandwiching the Rf gene, 5 markers linking in the position of the genetic distance of 0 . 2 to 0 . 3 cM from either side of the gene were isolated Fig. 1 shows the genomic map showing the genetic distance of each DNA marker and the Rf  gene.<br>
Example 2: Preparing contig and analysis of the Rf gene on the basis on the genomic map<br>
Subsequently to preparation of the genomic map, it is necessary that the genomic DNA corresponding to the position iscloned and the DNA markers sandwiching the Rf gene are linked. Since the DNA markers are distant from the Rf gene and thus, by combining a plurality of clones having the genome DNA fragment, the contig of the Rf_ gene region covering across DNA markers was prepared.<br>
A group of clones having the genome DNA fragment is named a genomic library. We prepared two types of the library. As a DNA donor, the genomic DNA was prepared from Yuanhong radish which is same as the parent of the restorer line used for preparation of the F2 population, by means of CTAB method (Murray, M. G. and Thompson, W. F. (1980) Nucleic Acids Res., 8, 4321) according to an ordinary technique. For the library, a lambda phage library of a 20 kb average length and 1.5 x 10^ population<br>
number was prepared by using I DASHII vector (STRATAGENE) as the lambda vector. As the cosmid vector, the cosmid library of a 40 kb average length and 5.5 x 10^ population number was prepared by using pWEB::TNC vector (EPICENTRE TECHNOLOGIES). In the contig preparation, a lambda clone was first isolated from the lambda phage library prepared in the above using the DNA marker located in both sides of the Rf  gene as<br><br>
an index by plaque hybridization technique. A cosmid clone was isolated from the cosmid library by using colony hybridization technique to complete the contig covering across the DNA markers of both sides as shown in Fig. 1. For the cosmid clones, NIT7/2 and T03-2, which compose a part of the contig, the nucleotide sequence was determined by an ordinary method.<br>
Subsequently, the nucleotide sequence of the cosmid clones NIT7/2 and T03-2 which compose a part of the contig above was analyzed by using 'Genscan" (Mitsubishi Space Software) in consideration of a parameter for Arabidopsis thaliana, of which the genomic DNA sequence is similar to that of radish and the total genome sequence was determined recently. As the result, the promoter region which is seemed to express the Rf gene, the structural gene region containing the intron, and the terminator region were discovered. In addition, the gene having a form to be translated to the protein which introns have been removed from and the amino acid sequence thereof were obtained.<br>
Example 3: Subcloning of the genomic DNA region<br>
Hpal-Swal fragment (8546 bp) of the DNA of the nucleotide sequence from 1st to 8553th of SEQ ID NO. 1, which contains enough regions from the promoter to the terminator which were presumed by 'Genscan", was separated from the vector by gel electrophoresis using agarose (FMC) for fragment collection. A gel containing the DNA fragment was digested by a GELase(Epicentre Technologies) to collect the DNA. Then, cloned fragments were obtained by cleavage of the obtained fragment using a restriction enzyme , BamRl. These DNA fragments were subcloned to pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) to obtain cds6BT/pGEM-T easy. Details will be described below.<br>

After infection, the cotyledon was transferred to the bacteria removed medium obtained by adding an antibiotic Carbenicillin (Pfeizer: zeopen or GIBCO-BRL: Carbenicillin disodium salts) at a concentration of 500 mg/ L to the MS basic medium containing vitamin B5, sucrose{3%) and 2, 4-D (1 mg/L) , so as to remove Agrobacterium,<br>
After passed through 5 days to 1 week on the bacteria removed medium, the hypocotyl was cultured on the MS basic medium containing vitamin B5 , sucrose (1%) , benzylaminopurine (3 mg/L) , Carbenicillin (500 mg/L) as well as silver nitrate (5 mg/L) and Kanamycin for selection (5 to 30 mg/L)(Nakalai Tesque; sulfate of Kanamycin) for 14 days to 21 days. In this time, there may appear a green callus, which should be immediately transferred by inoculating to the medium of the next step.<br>
The medium of the next step is exemplified by the selection medium of, for example, the MS basic medium (Sigma; M5519), sucrose (1%) , benzylaminopurine (3 mg/L) , zeatin(l mg/L) , Carbenicillin (500 mg/L) and Kanamycin(5 to 30 mg/L). The hypocotyl forming the callus from a cut point was transferred<br>
to this culture medium, and was cultured at 23°C for 3 weeks. Then, such transfer was repeated 3 to 5 times for every 3 weeks up to occurrence of the green callus.<br>
The green callus was, at any time when it found, cut from the hypocotyl, and was transferred to the medium having the same composition. Thereafter, when only the green portion was cut and subcultured, an adventitious bud was formed with a probability of 1 to 30%. Subsequently, the adventitious bud was transferred to the B5 basic medium (Sigma; G5893) to which sucrose (3%) andbenzylaminopurine (Img/L) were added, and grown followed by rooting on the MS medium (Sigma; M5519) containing sucrose (3%) , naphthalene acid (0.1 mg/L) and benzylaminopurine (0.01 mg/L).<br>
Example 7: Analysis of the transformant (detection of the DNA transferred)<br><br>
A leaf was taken from one individual of the transformant, which was obtained in the Example 6 and formed a bud, and the DNA was isolated using DNA isolation kit of Qiagen (DNAeasy Plant Mini).<br>
For 3 sites (sites a, bandc) of the DNA fragment transferred was detected by PCR method (the result is shown in Fig. 3) . The site a is 568 bp from 3186bp to 3753bp nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO.l, and as a forward primer "5'-GAAGCAAAAAAGAAAACGAGCAGAG-3'" (SEQ ID NO. 4) and as a reverse primer "5'-CCAAAAATCCGAAATCCGAATAGAC-3'" (SEQ ID NO.5) were used. The site b is 244 bp from 4869bp to 5112bp nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO.l, and as a forward primer "5'-CTCGGCTCTGGGTTTAGTGA-3'" (SEQ ID NO.6) and as a reverse primer "5'-TCCACAAACCCTAGCCAACA-3'" (SEQ ID NO.7) were used. The site c is 485 bp from 7766bp to 8250bp nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO. 1, and as a forward primer 5'-GCTTATGCTTCTCTGGTTCGCCTC-3'" (SEQ ID NO.8) and as a reverse primer "5'-CTCAGTTTTCGTCACCTTACACAATGC-3'" (SEQ ID NO.9) were used.<br>
To 1 μ 1 of the transformant DNA solution (50 ng/μ 1) were added 12 .1 μl of sterili zed water, 2 // lof 10 xPCRbuffer solution (100mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 500mM KCl) , 1.2 μ 1 of 25 mM MgCl2, 1.6 μl of 2.5mM dNTP mix, 1 μ 1 of 10 MM forward primer solution for each site, 1 μl of 10 μM reverse primer solution for each site, 0.1 μl of 5 unit/μl of rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) , followed by mixing. Then, the DNA was amplified by repeating<br>
35 times a cycle of 94 °C for 40 seconds, 55 "C for 30 seconds and 72 "C for 1 minute. UNOII (Biometra) was used as a thermal cycler. After completion of the reaction, the amplified product was detected by gel electrophoresis under the condition of 4%<br>
Nusive3:l Agarose (FMC)/I X TBE (89 mM Tris-borate, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) buffer solution (see Fig. 3)<br>
As the result, it was found that the site a was not transferred to this transformed rapeseed. It was found that in the remaining two sites (sites b and c) , the amplification<br><br>
product having the same size to that of a positive control was obyielded and therefore, the DNA was integrated into the transformed rapeseed.<br>
Example 8: Analysis of the transformant (detection of reduced accumulation of the cms associated protein ORF125)<br>
A flower bud of the same plant as that of the Example 7 was taken, and the reduced accumulation of the cms associated protein ORF 125 was analyzed by Western blotting. The result is shown in Fig. 4.<br>
(1)	Extraction of the protein from the transformed plant<br>
Protein extraction and Western blotting were carried out according to the method of N. Koizuka et al (Theor Appl Genet (2000) 100: 949-955).<br>
Specifically, 1 flower bud (1mm in length) of the obtained<br>
transformed rapeseed and 100 μ 1 of the ice-coo led buffer solution (50mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 2% (W/V) SDS) for protein extraction were put in an ice-cooled mortar and were ground with a pestle. This solution was transferred to a centrifugal microtube and<br>
centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 t . After centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh<br>
centrifugal microtube and heated at 100 °C for 5 minutes, Centrifugation was carried out again at 15000rpm and 4oC for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh centrifugal microtube to prepare SDS-solubilized protein solution. The concentration of the SDS-solubilized protein solution was measured by Bradford method using a protein quantification kit (Bio-rad). Simultaneously with this operation, the SDS-solubilized protein solution was similarly extracted from flower buds of rapeseed of the cytoplasmic male sterile line and rapeseed of the sterility restorer line, and the concentrations were measured.<br>
(2)	Separation of the protein by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a PVDF<br>
membrane: Western blotting<br><br>
Using 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gel of 7 x 10 cm square,<br>
15 μg of the SDS-solubilized protein was put on 1 lane for separation by electrophoresis. In addition, for comparison of accumulations of ORF125 protein, diluted series of rapeseed of the cytoplasmic male sterile line were put on thegel and separated Electrophoresis was conducted under the condition of 10 mA for 1 hour and 15 mA for 1 hour. After electrophoresis, the protein contained in the polyacrylamide gel was transferred to the PVDF membrane (Millipore) using semi-dry blotting apparatus (Nipppon Electrophoresis) under the condition of 100 mA for an hour.<br>
(3) Detection of the protein using an antibody: Western blotting<br>
The PVDF membranes to which the protein was transferred<br>
were cut into halves and transferred to 10 ml of a blocking solution<br>
(20mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20, 5% skim milk) , and were blocked by shaking for an hour. ATPA was detected on the top PVDFmembrane as the control of amitochondrial protein , and ORF125 which is the protein involved in the cytoplasmic male sterility was detected on the bottom PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was transferred to 10 ml of a primary antibody reaction solution (100μl of an ATPA monoclonal antibody for detection of ATPA was added to 10ml of the blocking solution, and 2μ1 of rabbit antiserum against ORF125 for detection of ORF125 was added (M. Iwabuchi et al. , Plant Molecular Biology (1999) 39: 183-188)), and shaken for 18 hours. The PVDF membrane was transferred to 100 ml of TTBS (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5) , 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween20) and shaken for 10 minutes. This operation was repeated 3 times to wash out an excessive primary antibody solution. The PVDF membrane was transferred to 10 ml of a secondary antibody reaction solution (to 10ml of the blocking solution were added 10μ 1 of peroxidase labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham) for detection of ATPA and 10μ1 of alkali phosphatase labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-rad) for detection of ORF125 respctively (M. Iwabuchiet al. Plant Molecular Biology<br>
(1999) 39 : 183-188) ) , andboth solutions were shaken for an hour.<br><br>
The PVDF membrane was transferred to 100ml of TTBS (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7 . 5) , 500mMNaCl, 0 , 0 5%Tween2 0) , and was shaken for 10 minutes This operation was repeated three times to wash out an excessive secondary antibody solution. Achemiluminescence system "ECL+" (Amersham) for peroxidase was used for detection of ATPA and exposure was carried out for 5 seconds for detection. For detection of ORF125, BCIP/NBT (MOSS Inc.) which is a coloring substrate for alkali phosphatase was used, and coloration and detection was carried out for 5 minutes.<br>
As the result, it was shown that the accumulations of ATPA which is the control are almost unchanged in the flower bud of the cytoplasmic male sterile rapeseed of 2 lines, fertility-restored raperapeseed, and the flower bud of the transformant rapeseed obtained by introducing DNA in the cytoplasmic male sterile line, but the accumulation of ORF125 protein was reduced significantly in the transformant rapeseed. A degree of this reduction is equal to that of the fertility-restored line obtained by transferring a fertility restorer gene to the cytoplasmic male sterile line by crossing (Fig. 4, and M. Iwabuchi et al. , Plant Molecular Biology (1999) 39: 183-188) . It was showed that the degree of reduction of ORF125 protein accumulation was 1/8 to 1/16 in fertility-restored raperapeseed and about 1/8 in the transformant rapeseed by comparison with the diluted series. As described above, the restoration of fertility in rapeseed strongly relates with the reduction of accumulation of ORF125 protein, and both means an identical sense. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the DNA sequence has a function of reducing the accumulation of ORF125 protein in the mitochondria and is a genome DNA sequence carrying the fertility restorer gene.<br>
In addition, the pollen grains were taken out from the flowering plant and microscopically observed. As the result, it was confirmed that normal pollens were produced (fig. 5.)<br>
Example 9: Isolation of cDNA.<br><br>
Isolation of cDNA was carried out by selecting the F2 plant which has homozygous Rfl genes and shows pollen fertility, as an RNA donor from the F2 population used for preparation of the gene map, purifying mRNA from the flower bud, and then using 5'-RACE or 3'-RACE method after synthesis of the cDNA. (Purification of mRNA)<br>
Total RNA was extracted from the flower bud of the F2 plant which has homozygous Rfl genes and shows pollen fertility, by applying guanidium thiocyanate method as an ordinary method by using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) . PolyA+RNA was purified from the total RNA using "mRNA Purification kit" (Amersham Pharmacia) using Origo (dT) cellulose column, and was used as mRNA. (Isolation of cDNA by 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE)<br>
cDNA was isolated using 1 /i g of purified mRNA using "Marathon RACE system 5'RACE 3'RACE" kit based on 5'-RACE and 3'-RACE methods. As gene specific primers, 5'-GATTCCTTTCTCTTGCATTTCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO.10) was used for the 5'-RACE, and 5'-ATCTCGTCCTTTACCTTCTGTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO.11) was used for the 3'-RACE. After the nucleotide sequence of the obtained clone was determined, the sequence of the cDNA was obtained (SEQ ID N0.2).<br>
Example 10: Conversion of cDNA to amino acid sequence, and analysis thereof<br>
(1) Conversion of cDNA to the amino acid sequence was carried out using an ordinary genetic code and a gene analysis software "Genetyx-SV" (Software Development K.K.), resulting in obtaining the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 . The PPR motif was analyzed by employing a program registered in Protein Families Database of Alignments and HMNs (hereafter abbreviated to Pfam; http://www.Sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/search.shtml) As the result of the analysis, it was found that the translated product of the fertility restorer gene of SEQ ID NO.l was the protein having 16 PPR motifs . The PPR motif has 3 PPR clusters . The 3 clusters were:<br><br>
(1)	PPR cluster #1: the PPR cluster composed of consecutive 175 residues of the first to fifth PPR motifs from the N terminal;<br>
(2)	PPR cluster #2 : the PPR cluster composed of consecutive 245 residues of the sixth to 12th PPR motifs from the N terminal ;and<br>
(3)	PPR cluster #3: the PPR cluster composed of consecutive 140 residues of the 13th to 16th PPR motifs from the N terminal.<br>
Example 11: Analysis of the protein of the present invention<br>
Itwas experimentedwhether or not translation is inhibited<br>
in Escherichia  coli  by binding to the transcription product<br>
(mRNA) of the gene of the protein ORF 125 causing Kosena cytoplasm male sterility.<br>
The fertility restorer gene of SEQ ID NO. 2 was introduced into BamHl-Sphl  site of the expression vector pQE-80L(Qiagen) of Escherichia  coli  to construct the expression vector which adds six histidine residues (6 x His)  to the N terminal<br>
(pQEBl/cds6) .   DNA was  amplified by using the primer: CGGGATCCGCTCACAATKSEQ ID NO.12) for introducing BaniHI site and M13 primer RV (Takara) and using pSTV29 (Takara) vector as a template.  For DNA amplification, Takara LA PCR Kit (Takara) was used.  The amplified DNA was cleaved by restriction enzymes Ba/nHI and EcoRI (Takara) , and then was purified by using Suprec-02 (Takara) .  In order to synthesize a DNA fragment having Ba/nHI and EcoRI sites in both ends of 5'-UTR site of or f 125 gene and 25 amino acids of orfl25,  PCR was carried out according to Fujimoto' method (Plant PCR Experiment Protocol: Practice of DNA synthesis. PP 84-87 (Syuuzyunsya)) using 2 primers.  The 2 primers used were: 125-5'Ba/nHI:<br>
GCGGATCCCAATTTCATTCTGCATCACTCTCCCTGTCGTTATCGACCTCGCAAGGTTTT TGAAACGGCCGAAACGGGAAGTGACAATACCGCTTTTCTTC (SEQ ID NO. 13) ; and<br>

GGAATTCACTAACTTTACATTCAGTAGGAGTGAGATTATGACAAAAAGTGGACAATTTT TCGAAAAAGGTAATCATGCATTTATATGCTGAAGAAAAGCG(SEQ ID NO.14).<br>
The amplified DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes<br><br>
BamHI andEcoRI (Takara) andpurifiedby using Suprec-02 (Takara) . The purified DNAwas ligated using TaKaRa Ligation kit (Takara) , Escherichia  coli  DHIOB (Gibco BRL) was transformed therewith<br>
and was cultured at 37°C for 18 hours or longer on LB agar medium (1% Bacto-Tryptone, 0.5% Bacto-Yeast Extract, 1% NaCl, 1.5%<br>
Bacto-Agar, 0. ImM IPTG, 20μg/ml X-Gal) to which 50Mg/ml of chloramphenicol (Sigma) was added, Aplasmid was extracted from a pale blue colony by an ordinary method, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. Thus, a vector (pSTV125-5'#LA6) was constructed where 174bp (7th to 180th nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 6) containing 5'-UTRregion of orjfI25 gene and 25 amino acids of orfl25 was introduced between EcoRI site and a transcription-starting point of lacZ gene. Further simultaneously, the vector having the fragment (7th to 193th nucleotide of the nucleotide sequence of Fig. 6) in which several mutations occur in the portion corresponding to the 174 bp, was obtained (pSTV125-5'#LA12).<br>
ThevectorspSTV125-5 '#LA6 and#LA.12 were each transferred to Escherichia coli DHIOB (Gibco BRL) , and the cells were standing-cultured on the agar medium obtained by adding 50 fi g/ml of chloramphenicol (Wako Pure Chemicals) , 200 ixM of IPTG (Wako Pure Chemicals) and 40 /i g/ml of X-Gal (Takara) toLBmedium, at 37 X^ overnight to grow the colony, resulting in pale blue colony. Thus, it was confirmed that that the transferred LacZ gene was expressed in Escherichia coli to which either vector was transferred.<br>
In addition, in order to transfer the above pSTV125-5' vector and pQEBl/cds6 vector to the Escherichia coli which is same as that described above, when the cells were cultured using<br>
the medium to which 50μg/ml of Ampicillin was added, in the case of co-cultureing with pSTV125-5'#LA6, the colony became white. However, in case of co-culturing with pSTV125-5'#LA12 having a mutation in a transfer fragment site, the colony became pale blue, and the degree of bluing was same as that of the case of #LA12 alone. Whether Escherichia coli  lack any one of these<br><br>
transferred vectors was examined by extracting the vectors by an ordinary method after culturing of each colony.<br>
From the above results, it is understood that the protein expressed in Escherichia coli by pQEBl/cds6 vector became the white colony through suppression of expression of LacZ gene as the result of binding with mRNA of pSTV125-5 ' #LA6 . In case of co-culturing with pSTV125-5'#LA12, it is understood that mutation occurs in the transfer fragment site and thus, the protein derived from pQEBl/cds6 can not be bound to mRNA and as the result, LacZ  gene is expressed to make blue.<br>
Consequently, it is supposed that the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO. 3 influences mRNA of or f 125, more specifically the transcription product of a code region of at least orfI25-5'UTR region and 25 amino acid residues of ORF125 so as to suppress expression of the ORF125 protein.<br>
It is presumed that the translation product of the gene of the present invention is, after translocated to the mitochondria, binds to the male sterile gene in the mitochondria to inhibit translation, resulting in reduction of the accumulation of the causal protein of cytoplasmic male sterility and thereby cytoplasmic male sterility is restored to fertility.<br>
Example 12: Isolation of the fertility restorer gene of Kosena rapeseed<br>
The genome sequence of the fertility restorer gene was obtained from the line of rapeseed (hereafter Kosena rapeseed) which was obtained by transferring the fertility restorer gene of Kosena radish by cell fusion, by applying PCR method.

DNA was amplified by repeating 30 times<br>
a cycle of 98 °C for 20 seconds and 68 °C for 15 minutes.  The thermal cycler used was UNOII (Biometra). After completion of the reaction, about 6 kb of the amplified product was purified using the ultrafiltration filter unit Microcon-PCR (Millipore) . The nucleotide sequence of 3306 bp of 4280th to 7585th nucleotide<br>
of SEQ ID NO. 1 was determined by an ordinary method using the purified product as the template (SEQ ID NO. 15) . By comparison<br>
of the genome nucleotide sequence obtained from Kosena rapeseed with the sequence obtained from Yuanhong radish, DNA nucleotide substitutions were found in 7bp among 3306bp, and it was revealed that they have a high homology.<br>
Further, cDNA sequence of the fertility restorer gene of Kosena rapeseed at 3' part was obtained by RT-PCR, and it was confirmed that introns were spliced in the same manner as in Yuanhong radish. From the bud of Kosena rapeseed, the total RNA was extracted by AGPC (Acid Guanidium-Phenol-Chloroform) method (Syuuzyunsya.

The thermal cycler used was UNOII (Biometra) . To 3μ 1 of the amplified product were added 1μl of pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega), 5 μ 1 of 2 X ligation buffer solution (Promega) and 1μ1 of T4 DNA ligase (Promega), and the mixture was left standing at room temperature for 1 hour to ligate to the vector, Escherichia<br>
coli DH5 a (Gibco BRL) was transformed with this vector to obtion a clone. The nucleotide sequence of the obtained clone was determined by an ordinary method, and it was confirmed that introns of the cDNA of Kosena rapeseed was spliced in the similar way as in Yuanhong radish. Thus, it was found that 7bp base substitutions found by the genome sequence comparison were present in 5444 bp to 5814 bp of SEQ ID NO. 1 and did not influence the splicing.<br>
From the above results, it was found that the fertility restorer gene of Kosena rapeseed was expressed in the similar way as in Yuanhong radish. The sequence of cDNA which encodes only the translation region is shown in SEQ ID NO. 16. The amino acidsequence (SEQIDN0.17) was obtained from this cDNA sequence .<br>

To 2 μ1 of an Ogura rapeseed cDNA solution which was diluted 250 times were added 8.6μ1 of sterilized water, 2μ 1 of 10 x LA PCR buffer solution (Takara) , 2μl of 25 mM MgCl2, 3.2μ 1 of 2.5mM dNTP mix, 1μ1 of 10 μ primer solution of SEQ IDNO.9907F, 1 M 1 of 10 jU M adapter primer solution (Marathon RACE system<br>
5'RACE 3'RACE kit, Clontech) and 0.2 μ1 of 5 unit/M 1 TaKaRa LA Taq (Takara), followed by mixing.  DNA was amplified by<br>
repeating 5 times a cycle of 98 t for 5 seconds and 72 X^ for 3 minutes, 5 times a cycle at 98 °C for 5 seconds and 70 oC for 3 minutes, and 25 times a cycle of 98oC for 5 seconds and 68°C for 3 minutes .  The obtained DNA solution was diluted 100 times ,<br>
and to 2 μ 1 thereof were added 8.6 μ1 of sterilized water, 2 M 1 of 10 X LA PCR buffer solution (Takara) , 2μ 1 of 25 mM MgCl2, 3.2 μl of 2.5mM dNTP mix, 1 μ1 of 10μM primer solution of SEQ ID NO. 5' ogu-1, 1 M 1 of 10 μ M adapter primer solution (Marathon RACE system 5'RACE 3'RACE kit, Clontech) and 0.2 μ 1 of 5 unit/ μ 1 TaKaRa LA. Taq (Takara) , followed by mixing. DNA was amplified by repeating 5 times a cycle of 98 oC for 5 seconds and 72 °C for 3 minutes, 5 times a cycle of 98 °C for 5 seconds and 70 °C for 3 minutes , and 25 times a cycle of 98Cfor 5 seconds and 68 °C for 3 minutes. The thermal cycler used was UNOII (Biometra).<br><br><br>
was left standing at room temperature for 1 hour to ligate with<br>
the vector. Escherichia coli DH5 α (Gibco BRL) was transformed with this vector to obtain a clone. The nucleotide sequence of the obtained clone was determined, and then, 5'RACE sequence and 3'RACE sequence corresponding to the above 4 partial sequences of cDNA were obtained. The full length cDNA sequence was obtained by combinating each sequence. Among these, the sequence having the highest homology with cDNA sequence of Yuanhong radish was identified as the fertility restorer gene of Kosena rapeseed (SEQ ID NO-18). Further, the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO.19) was obtained from the cDNA.<br>
Example 15: Analysis of the fertility restorer gene<br>
For individual fertility restorer genes obtained by the above method, analyses were conducted by using an gene analysis software "Mac Vector 6.5" (Oxford Molecular Ltd.) for homology of the cDNA sequence and the amino acid sequence and by using Protein families database of alignments and HMNs usable in Sanger Institute, U. K. for motif analysis.<br>
All of the Rf_ genes derived from Yuanhong radish, Kosena rapeseed and Ogura rapeseed according to the present invention have 16 PPR motifs, and these PPR motif groups are divided into 3 blocks of 5, 7, and 4 motifs from the amino terminal, and the<br><br>
fourth amino acid located in the second PPR motif from the amino terminal was asparagine. The partial fragment derived from Raphanus raphanistrum was also analyzed by applying it to the corresponding part {94th to 264th of the SEQ ID NO. 26) of the above sequence, and as the result, it was found that it had a part corresponding to the first to sixth PPR motifs from the amino terminal, and the PPR motif groups and the fourth amino acid located in the second PPR motif from the amino terminal also showed the characteristics as described above.<br>
Moreover, among 3 fertility restorer genes obtained from Yuanhong radish, Kosena rapeseed and Ogura rapeseed, and the protein (SEQ ID NO.26) and the gene encoding it (SEQ ID NO.27) of the present invention which were obtained by the result of the analysis of the partial sequence of the fertility restorer gene of R raphanistrum, Yuanhong radish shows very high homology with Kosena rapeseed.  That is, the amino acid sequences show high homology value of 99.6% (only 3 amino acids are different) and the nucleotide sequences show high homology value of 99.7%. Therefore, the protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO.29 and the gene (SEQ ID NO.25) encoding it are particularly preferred.<br>
On the other hand, comparison of Ogura rapeseed with Yuanhong radish and Ogura rapeseed with Kosena rapeseed showed a high homology. Each homology in the amino acid sequence showed 92.0% in comparison of Ogura rapeseed with Yuanhong radish and 91. 6% in comparison of Ogura rapeseed with Kosena rapeseed. The comparison in the nucleotide sequence showed about 95% in both cases . These values are lower than thosebetween Yuanhong radish and Kosena rapeseed.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
According to the present invention , Rf gene, particularly the Rfl gene derived from radish was isolated and a structure thereof was determined. According to the present invention, a means for establishing a rapeseed fertility restorer line can<br><br>
be provided using the isolated Rf  gene<br><br><br><br><br>
