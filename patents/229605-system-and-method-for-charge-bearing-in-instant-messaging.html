FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention applies to the Instant Messaging technology for delivering and displaying instant messages based on their priority, thereby higher priority messages will be delivered before the lower priority ones and messages will be displayed in such a way that the recipient can easily distinguish the messages based on the priority associated with them. This invention also applies to the priority based delivery and message display for the messages sent/received by particular user/ groups.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
One to One Instant Messages<br>
Currently, in one to one Instant Messaging, the messages will be sent from one IM Client (sender) to another IM Client (recipient) and will be delivered at the recipient. The IM Server maintains a queue of messages and delivers them one after the other. Each message will have attributes such as message content MIME type, validity of the message, timestamp when the message is sent, recipient's information, etc. associated with them.<br>
Group Chatting<br>
In group chatting, messages are sent by various members of different groups.<br><br>
Here multiple IM Clients send messages those will be delivered to different recipient clients. IM Server will broadcast the messages send by each member of the group to other members. The message attributes that are valid for one to one Instant Messaging such as message content, MIME type, validity of the message, timestamp when the message is sent etc are valid in this case also. Also there will be the ID of the group involved in chat.<br>
Structure of the related art<br>
1.	The IM user composes and sends the message for the recipient through the IM Server.<br>
2.	The IM Server receives the message and keeps it in a message queue.<br>
3.	The IM Server picks up the messages from the message queue in the FIFO order and delivers them to the recipient.<br>
4.	The recipient receives the message and displays it.<br>
Operation of the related art<br>
1.	IM client (Sender) composes a message and sends the message with a message header which contains attributes of the message such as content MIME type, validity of the message, timestamp when message is sent, recipient's information, etc.<br>
2.	Many senders may send messages to same or different recipients simultaneously through the same IM Server.<br><br>
3.	IM Server receives the messages from these senders and puts the messages in a message queue.<br>
4.	If there are many senders sending messages simultaneously or the IM Server is busy, messages may have to wait for some time in the message queue.<br>
5.	The IM Server takes the messages from the message queue in FIFO order for delivery.<br>
6.	The IM Server delivers the messages to the recipients.<br>
7.	The recipient IM Client receives the messages and displays them.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1.	When multiple users send instant messages simultaneously, the message queue will contain more number of messages and there will be delay in delivering the messages.<br>
2.	If a user wants to send a time critical message and the server's message queue contains more messages, then there will be significant delay in delivering that important message which is not desirable.<br>
3.	Since the IM client displays all the messages in a similar way (since the IM Client is unable to identify whether a message is important or less important) it will be difficult for the user to distinguish important messages from normal messages.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to introduce message priority in instant messaging so that the instant messaging user can set priority levels to the messages, there by the IM Server can deliver higher priority messages before delivering lower priority messages. By this, the user can send important messages with high priority so that the server will deliver them before delivering less important messages with lower priority. This invention also introduces assigning priority to IM senders, recipients and IM Chat groups so that:<br>
a.	Messages from a higher priority sender can be delivered to the recipient<br>
before the one from a lower pnority sender<br>
b.	Messages to a higher priority recipient can be delivered before delivering<br>
messages to lower priority recipients.<br>
c.	Messages from a higher priority group can be delivered to the recipient<br>
before the one from a lower priority group<br>
d.	Messages to a higher priority group can be delivered before delivering<br>
messages to a lower priority group.<br>
According to this invention, user can set priority to instant messages, senders, recipients and sending and recipient groups and the IM server can deliver higher priority messages before the lower priority ones or messages from/to a higher priority sender/recipient/group can be delivered before the ones from/to lower priority   sender/recipient/group.   When   the   recipient   IM   client   receives   the<br><br>
messages, it can display the messages based on the priority associated with them so that the end user can easily distinguish messages based on their priorities.<br>
This invention proposes a method and system of assigning priority to the instant messages, senders, recipients and sending and recipient groups before sending or foHA/arding so that IM Server and the recipient IM Client can easily distinguish the messages based on priorities of messages/users/groups.<br>
This invention further proposes a method and system wherein the IM Server delivers higher priority messages before lower priority messages to the recipients.<br>
This invention further proposes a method and system wherein the IM Server delivers messages from higher priority senders before the ones from lower priority senders to the recipients<br>
This invention further proposes a method and system wherein the IM Server delivers messages from higher priority groups before the ones from lower priority groups to the recipients<br>
This invention further proposes a method and system wherein the IM Server delivers messages to higher priority recipients/groups before delivering messages to lower priority recipients/groups<br>
This invention further proposes a method and system wherein the recipient IM Clients can display the messages based on the priority levels of messages and senders/sending groups and end user can easily distinguish the messages based on these priorities and importance. Thus users will get immediate attention on<br><br>
important messages that are sent with higher priorities or sent by higher priority users/groups.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for priority in instant messaging comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	assigning priority to message/users/groups at the sending IM Client;<br>
(b)	delivering messages with higher priorities before the lower priority ones; and<br>
(c)	displaying the message in the recipient IM Client, based on the priority level associated with the message/users/groups.<br><br>
ng messages witn nigner pnonties Derore ine lower pnonty ones tne IM identifies the messages based on their priority and maintains a priority<br>
The user assigns priority to the message/user/group based on the importance of the messages/user/group, before sending messages to other users/groups where the IM Client sets the priority to messages, users and groups. When the user sets the priority to a message, or a user or a group, the IM client adds the priority flag in the message header and sends the message. If a message is to be forwarded, an IM user assigns a priority to that message before forwarding the same. While delivering messages with higher priorities before the lower priority ones the IM server<br>

Accordingly,  this  invention  further explains  a  system  for priority in  instant messaging comprising:<br>
(a)	means for assigning priority to message/users/groups at the sending IM Client;<br>
(b)	means for delivering messages with higher priorities before the lower priority ones; and<br>
(c)	means for displaying the message in the recipient IM Client, based on the priority level associated with the message/users/groups.<br>
In the said system the user assigns priority to the message/user/group based on the importance of the messages/user/group, before sending messages to other users/groups where the IM Client sets the priority to messages, users and groups. When the user sets the priority to a message, or a user or a group, the IM client adds the priority flag in the message header and sends the message. In the said system if a message is to be forwarded, an IM user assigns a priority to that message before fon/varding the same. While delivering messages with higher priorities before the lower priority ones the IM server identifies the messages<br><br>
based on their priority and maintains a priority queue for the messages. The IM server identifies the messages based on their priority and sends the higher priority messages to the recipient IM client first where the higher priority messages waits less time in the message queue, compared to lower priority messages there by the, higher priority messages will be delivered to the recipient before lower priority ones. During displaying the message the recipient IM client identifies the priority of the message/user/group associated with the message and displays the message based on its priority, there by the recipient user identify the messages based on the priorities of messages/users/groups and importance.<br>
The other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPAYNING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the normal instant message flow.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the instant message flow with priority associated with each message.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The invention has three parts:<br>
1.	Assigning priority to message/users/groups at the sending IM Client<br>
2.	Delivering   messages   with   higher   priorities/sent   by/to   higher   priority users/groups before the lower priority ones<br>
3.	Displaying the message in the recipient IM Client differently, based on the priority level associated with the message/users/groups<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Assigning priority to messages/users/groups at the sending IM Client<br>
User  can   assign   priority  to  the  message/user/group   based   on  the importance of the messages/user/group, before sending messages to other<br><br>
users/groups. The IM Client should provide the option for setting priority to messages, users and groups. When the user sets the priority to a message, or a user or a group and sends that, the IM client will add the necessary priority flag in the message header and sends the message. If an IM user wants to forward a message he can assign priority to that message before forwarding the same.<br>
2.  Delivering higher priority messages before the lower priority ones<br>
The IM server identifies the messages based on their priority. It maintains a priority queue for the messages and sends the higher priority messages to the recipient IM client first; there by higher priority messages will be waiting less time in the message queue, compared to lower priority messages. In this way, higher priority messages will be delivered to the recipient before lower priority ones.<br>
3.  Displaying the message in the recipient IM Client differently, based on the priority level associated with the message.<br>
The recipient IM client identifies the priority of the message/user/group associated with the message and displays the message based on its priority, there by the recipient user can easily identify the messages based on the priorities of messages/users/groups and importance.<br>
The  following   are  the  advantages  of assigning   priority  to  the  instant messages/users/groups:<br><br>
1.	Messages can be delivered based on the priority of messages/users/groups so that higher priority messages and messages from higher priority users and groups need not wait long time in the message queue and they can be delivered before delivering the lower priority messages.<br>
2.	Messages can be displayed at the recipient client based on the priority of messages/users/groups so that the recipient user can easily distinguish high priority messages and messages from higher priority users/groups from lower priority ones. Thus user's will get immediate attention on such messages.<br>
Figure 1 describes the normal instant message flow, the operation has four major steps:<br>
1.	Sending users compose instant messages and sending clients build message headers attached with it. The message header contains message attributes such as recipient's information, content MIME type, validity of the message, timestamp when message is sent, etc. Many users can send messages simultaneously through the IM server.<br>
2.	IM Server receives the messages from Senders and keeps the messages in the Message Queue. The messages received first are queued first in the Message Queue. If there are multiple Senders sending messages through the IM Server, the Message Queue may be flooded with the messages.<br><br>
3.	IM Server retrieves the messages from the Message Queue in FIFO order. There might be some messages which are important and at the rear of the queue. But they will be picked up from the Message Queue after all the messages prior to these messages are sent.<br>
4.	IM Server sends the messages one by one to the respective recipients. Recipients receive the messages from the Server and display the messages on the client. All the messages including important messages are displayed in similar way on the recipient's client.<br>
Figure 2 describes the instant message flow with priority associated with each message, the operation has four major steps:<br>
1.	Sending users compose instant messages and associate priority to each message based on their importance. Important messages may have higher priorities and some informative messages may have lower priorities. IM user can also set priority to other users and/or groups he used to send messages. Sending clients build message header attached with each message. Message header contains priority as one of the attributes along with other attributes of the message.<br>
2.	IM Server receives the messages from Senders and keeps the messages in the priority based Message Queue. If many Senders send message simultaneously or the IM Server is busy, there may be many messages waiting in the Message Queue for delivery. The Server maintains the priority queue in such a way that the higher priority messages can be selected for delivery before the lower priority ones. In order to avoid<br><br>
blocking lower priority messages from delivery, in case if the IM server receives more higher priority messages for a long period, the priority queue is maintained in the server in such a way that, the priority level of the lower priority messages increase upon their waiting time in the queue increases considerably.<br>
3.	IM Server retrieves the messages from the priority based Message Queue.<br>
IM Server gets higher priority messages from the Message Queue before<br>
lower priority ones so that higher priority messages can be sent before<br>
lower priority ones.<br>
4.	IM Server delivers the messages to the Recipients. Recipient IM clients<br>
receive the messages from the IM Server and read the headers of each<br>
message. Recipient IM client displays each message based on its priority.<br>
Recipient IM client displays higher priority messages differently than lower<br>
priority messages so that the recipient user gets immediate attention.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the descnption and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br><br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
