The inversion quick release valve for the air brake system of a motor vehicle, according to this invention, comprises a valve body (2) provided with a spring brake control port (43), a primary service port (41), a secondary service port (42), two delivery ports (21 and 22) and integrated double check valve (9,7) with primary check valve (9) and secondary check valve (7) works along with bonded valve (8). The valve body (2) houses a piston (3) with graduated springs (12 and 14), spring loaded inlet exhaust valve (5), "O" ring retainer (6), floating valve seat (10), spring -loaded ring piston (4), and guide ring (13). The top cover (1) is fixed to the valve body (2) by 4 bolts.<br>
The split arrangement of piston (3) and spring (11) loaded ring piston (4) renders the inversion valve more stable as compared to conventional device.<br>
The inversion quick release valve with in-built quick release mechanism comprising a valve body (2), a top cover (1), a piston (3) and piston ring (4) incorporated within the valve body (2), an integrated double check valve (9,7), is placed in the valve body (2), and connected to inlet/exhaust valve (5), for the anti-compounding function, the inlet/exhaust valve (5) admit air into system and exhaust air from the system at specified condition, a floating valve having a seat (10), designed for quick release function. Two graduated springs (12 and 14) positioned in the piston balances against air pressure for releasing spring brake in the normal spring brake application, the quick releasing mechanism is incorporated by the floating valve seat (10) with exhaust air into atmosphere suddenly for faster spring brake application.<br><br>
In the conventional system the Inlet valve seat is stationery and in the! invented device the inlet valve is floating up and down at appropriate levels forj activating the quick release function this way when the valve seat (10) moves up air goes into the system and when the valve goes down air from the system is exhausted for spring brake application.<br>
The ring piston exerts compressive and tensile forces, respectively, during the upward and downward movement of the ring piston.<br>
The inversion quick release valve is used in trucks or tractors equipped with spring brakes. The valve is used in dual air brake system to perform the following four functions:<br>
1.	During normal operation this valve permits a particular value of hold-off pressure to the spring brakes thereby keeping it released. This hold-off pressure can be varied from 4 bar to 7 bar.<br>
2.	During parking of the vehicle, this valve quickly exhausts air from the spring brakes thereby allowing a fast application of the spring brakes<br>
3.	Prevents compounding of service brake and spring brake<br>
4.	Modulates application of spring brakes in the event of a failure in the primary service circuit<br>
This valve has five modes of operation and they are detailed below:<br>
1. Spring brakes released<br>
When the full system pressure is reached, the 'park control valve' can be operated to release the spring brakes. The park control valve is a manually operated on/off valve. Shifting the park control valve to the *on' condition ensures continuous supply of air pressure at the spring brake control port of the inversion valve. Pressurised air at the spring brake control port then enters the double check valve, shifts the bonded valve, and flows into the cavity beneath the floating valve seat. This air pressure forces the floating valve seat to move upwards and charges the delivery ports for keeping the spring brakes released. At the same time the exhaust valve seat in the piston prevents loss of air through exhaust.<br><br>
The limiting value of the hold-off pressure (or pressure at the delivery ports) to the spring brakes can be varied between 4 bar to 7 bar by changing the spring load on the piston with the help of the adjustment screw.<br>
2.	Balanced condition<br>
The air pressure that is communicated to the delivery ports also acts on the underside of the piston and top of floating inlet valve seat. When the airhead load on the piston equals the load exerted by the graduating spring, the valve is in the 'balanced' condition. In this condition the inlet valve seat and the exhaust valve seat are in the same plane thereby preventing further flow of air to delivery ports and at the same time preventing loss of air through exhaust.<br>
3.	Spring brakes applied<br>
The park control valve is switched to the 'off position to apply the parking brakes. Air pressure at the spring brake control port is exhausted through the park control valve. Airhead load beneath the piston forces the floating valve seat to move downwards thereby opening the exhaust passage and sealing the inlet. Air from the delivery ports is then exhausted thereby applying the spring brakes.<br>
4.	Service brakes applied with spring brakes released (Anti-compounding)<br>
Application of service brakes provides air pressure at the primary service port<br>
and secondary service port . There is no air pressure in the spring brake control<br>
port since the spring brakes are applied. Air entering the primary service port ,<br>
enters the double check valve, shifts the bonded valve, and flows into the cavity<br>
beneath the floating valve seat. This air pressure forces the floating valve seat to<br>
move upwards and charges the delivery ports. At the same time the exhaust<br>
valve seat in the piston prevents loss of air through exhaust. Consequently the<br>
spring brakes are released thereby preventing the compounding of the service<br>
brake and the parking brake. Continuous application of the service brakes<br>
results in the 'balanced' condition explained eariier.<br>
Air that enters the valve body through the ports 41 and 42 gets neutralized since the pressure and sealing areas on the top and bottom of the relay piston are essentially equal.<br><br>
5. Application of spring brakes with primary in failed condition (Modulated application)<br>
In the event of failure in the primary circuit, upon application of service brakes the air pressure will be available only in the secondary service port 42. However, air pressure also will be available at the spring brake control port and consequently the delivery ports thereby keeping the spring brakes released. Air that enters the valve through the secondary service port 42 acts beneath the ring piston and forces the piston to move upward thereby exhausting air from the delivery ports and applying the spring brakes. The air released from the spring brakes will be proportional to the pressure at secondary service port 42 thus providing the driver with a modulated application of the spring brakes.<br>
Unique features of the valve according to this invention<br>
1.	Inversion, pressure-limiting and quick release functions are achieved by<br>
the same valve<br>
The combination of piston, piston ring, floating valve seat and inlet/exhaust valve in the inversion valve is used to achieve the functions, namely inversion, pressure limiting and quick release.<br>
2.	Split arrangement of piston<br>
The split arrangement of piston and spring loaded ring piston makes the valve more stable and insensitive to pressure lead from primary service port. Also the split arrangement of piston makes the valve resistant to false actuation of the valve during a traction control situation.<br>
S.Quick release by floating inlet valve seat<br>
The floating inlet valve seat aids the quick release of delivery air pressure to exhaust for quick application of spring brakes.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the<br><br>
!<br>
present invention, which come within the scope of the following claims, are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br><br>
