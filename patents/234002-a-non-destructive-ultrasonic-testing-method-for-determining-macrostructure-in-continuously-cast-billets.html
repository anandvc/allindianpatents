				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a non-destructive ultrasonic testing method for<br>
determining macrostructure in continuously cast billets. More particularly the<br>
invention relates to an off line non-destructive method of ultrasonic testing to<br>
determine macrostructure (columnar and equiaxed zone as well as flaws) in<br>
continuously cast billets by scanning through one face of the continuously cast<br>
billet samples using ultrasonic 10 MHz single crystal and 6 MHz twin crystal<br>
normal probe. This determination is very important for determining the quality<br>
of continuously cast billets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Determining the macro-cast billets assist in modifying the process parameters for<br>
improving the billet quality.<br>
At present there is no off-line non-destructive testing technique (NOT), which<br>
could accurately determine the macro-structure in continuously cast steel<br>
products. Assessment of macro-structure of continuously cast steel products<br>
(billets / slabs / blooms) are generally done by visual inspection of macro-etch,<br>
or by sulphur print evaluation methods on transverse / longitudinal cut slices.<br>
With the use of electromagnetic stirring (ENS) in continuous casting of steel, the<br>
steel melt is homogenized for obtaining a solid structure upon solidification. The<br>
effect of electro-magnetic stirring on continuously cast billets and slabs can be<br>
assessed by the above-mentioned methods. But macro-etching and sulphur<br>
print methods provide information in one plane only. For more realistic<br>
assessment these methods require large number of test samples and hot acids,<br>
which is hazardous and pollute the atmosphere also. Ultrasonic assessment<br>
provides through thickness information of the test samples. Ultrasonic method is<br>
pollution free and eco-friendly method, non-destructive, and may require less<br>
number of samples also.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Because of the problems associated with macro-etching and sulphur print<br>
methods, there was a need to find out the possibility of assessment of such<br>
macro-structures (including columnar / equiaxed grain, flaws / macro-inclusions,<br>
central looseness, porosity etc.) by non-destructive technique.<br>
Due to heterogeneous cast structure and presence of flaws, ultrasonic losses are<br>
significant when it is scanned from edges to the center of the transverse cut<br>
slices of continuously cast steel products.<br>
The variation of ultrasonic losses depends on the severity of change in macro-<br>
structure.<br>
For indicating ultrasonic losses, drop in back-wall echo can be measured wharaas<br>
for finding tha severity of flaws, the ultrasonic internal reflections can be<br>
counted.<br>
Tha pattern of echo drop can be studied and it is possible to predict aquiaxad<br>
zona in continuously cast steal billets. Tha effect of electro-magnetic stirring on<br>
the macro-structure of low carbon as well as high carbon billets, could be<br>
assassad by this unique technique.<br>
Tha operating cost of this method is very low and the assessment of macro-<br>
structure is fast. Hence quick corrective / preventive actions can be taken.<br>
Large volume of tha test specimen can be inspected by this method when<br>
compared with other techniques (e.g. macro-etching / sulphur print etc.).<br>
Thus, the present invention provides a non destructive ultrasonic testing method<br>
for determining macro structure in continuously cast billets for studying the<br>
effects of electromagnetic stirring, comprising the steps of selecting the<br>
continuously cast billets from different grades of steal like low carbon (Witt),<br>
high carbon (PC 115 and 75 / 80); saw cutting samples in desired sections from<br>
the selected billets, keeping transverse faces parallel; grinding and finishing said<br>
parallel transverse faces for ultrasonic test; identifying equiaxed / columnar<br>
transition by changing in ultrasonic backwall echo amplitude using a single<br>
crystal normal probe; and evaluating flaws indicated by number of back<br>
scattered signals using a twin crystal normal probe. This determination will<br>
assist in modifying the process parameters to improve the billet quality.<br>
The conclusions derived from the ultrasonic results art given below:<br>
LOW CARSON GRADES WR-3:<br>
? Due to the electro magnetic stirring (EMS) system, the billet portion<br>
towards the inner and outer radius becomes cleaner. The cleaning effect<br>
was more towards the inner radius than that towards outer radius.<br>
Ultrasonic investigation reveals more number of flaws in the central region<br>
when compared with rest portion of the sample.<br>
? Electro magnetic stirring (EMS) system was found less effective during the<br>
process of equiaxed zone formation in low carbon samples.<br>
HIGH CARBON GRADES PC-115:<br>
? Electro magnetic stirring (EMS) is quite effective towards the surface. It<br>
seems that high carbon grade is much cleaner than the low carbon<br>
grades.<br>
? It seems that due to electro magnetic stirring (EMS) practice, there is 2<br>
times increase in the equiaxed zone if compared with Non-EMS sample.<br>
HIGH CARBON GRAPES 75/80:<br>
? Electro magnetic stirring (EMS) is quite effective towards the surface. It<br>
seems that high carbon grade continuously cast billets are much cleaner<br>
than the low carbon grade continuously cast billets.<br>
? It seems that due to electro magnetic stirring (EMS) practice, there is 4<br>
times increase in the equiaxed zone if compared with non- electro<br>
magnetic stirring (EMS) sample.<br>

DETAILED DECEPTION<br>
Ultrasonic waves when pass through a continuously cast billet / slab test piece<br>
which has a heterogeneous structure (dendritic, columnar, equiexed with pin /<br>
blow holes, non-metallic Inclusions, cracks etc.), it interacts with all these<br>
reflectors / scatterers. The ultrasonic signal observed on the oscilloscope Is<br>
resultant amplitudes of the reflections, diffraction and scattering of ultrasound<br>
with ail the above structures. When the macro-structure changes from columnar<br>
to equiaxed, there are a lot of ultrasonic losses, which is shown as a sudden<br>
reduction in back-wall echo of ultrasound. On this basis columnar / equiaxed<br>
transition is identified in the test samples. Other flaws in the sample are equiaxd<br>
as backscattered signals on the oscilloscope.<br>
P.C. Glaws(5) studied in detail the influence of electro magnetic stirring (EMS) on<br>
inclusion distribution as measured by ultrasonic inspection. He preferred<br>
ultrasonic method in comparison to other methods due to the possibility of larger<br>
volume of inspection.<br>
Determination of columnar / equiaxed zone transition is a tedious and laborious<br>
job using macro etching / sulphur printing and by metallography. The ultrasonic<br>
method can be considered a better way of understanding the variation of such<br>
structure in continuously cast steel products due to it simplicity in use and<br>
getting quantitative results. The sensitivity of ultrasonic losses with the<br>
microstructure has been reported by the authors (6-7). The difficulty in ultrasonic<br>
inspection due to high ultrasonic losses and changes in ultrasonic velocity had<br>
been recognized earlier and pretence of coarse dendrites. In the inspection of<br>
cast stainless steel a difference in ultrasonic velocity in chill / columnar /<br>
equiaxed zone were reported by J. L Rose et. al. (8) and corrections were<br>
recommended in locating the defects.<br>
Depending upon the cooling conditions a chill zone is first formed at the region in<br>
contact with mould followed by columnar and then equiaxed zone at the core<br>
(Figure 1). A large equiaxed lone is desired to reduce inter -columnar<br>
segregation, axial segregation and central looseness.<br>
There has been continuous change in the steel making process in enter to<br>
reduce these delects. The following corrective actions may be incorporated:<br>
• Steps to reduce slag carry over<br>
• Nozzle design to improve fluid flow in the mould<br>
• Tundish design to improve inclusion floatation<br>
• Argon shrouding to reduce oxidation of metal stream by air<br>
• improvement in deoxidanon practice<br>
• Changes in the Strand radius<br>
• Reduction in superheat<br>
• Application of electro-magnetic stirring (EMS) system etc.<br>
These corrective actions cause increase in equiaxed zone as well as to<br>
reduction in the flaws.<br>
The use of electro magnetic stirring (EMS) to improve the quality of strand cast<br>
steel has continued to grow over the last fifteen years. As a more thorough<br>
understanding of electro magnetic stirring (EMS) is achieved, improvement and<br>
refinements to the process continue to be made.<br>
The original awareness of the influence of a magnetic field on the motion of an<br>
electrically conducting fluid through induced currents was achieved in the early<br>
nineteenth century. The first proposal to exploit this effect for stirring of<br>
solidifying metal was made in 1917. Although the results were promising, only<br>
sporadic interest in electro magnet stirring (EMS) was generated until the viable<br>
commercialization of the continuous casting process for steel, when Junghans<br>
and Schaaber designed an electro magnetic stirring (EMS) system specifically<br>
for continuous casting of steel.<br>
Still the use of electro magnetic stirring (EMS) in continuous casting of steel,<br>
like continuous casting itself, was slow in developing. Despite of the early<br>
awareness of the influence of time varying magnetic fields on the motion of<br>
conducting fluids and the resulting improvement in the cast structure, the first<br>
commercial electro magnetic stirring (EMS) installation was not started until<br>
1973. However, since that time, the benefits of electro magnetic stirring<br>
(EMS) have been recognized and over a hundred stirrers have been installed.<br>
The primary benefits obtained with electro magnetic stirring (EMS) have been<br>
thoroughly treated in the literature. Simply put, the purpose of electro<br>
magnetic stirring (EMS) is to homogenize the steel melt in order to obtain a<br>
favourable solid structure upon solidification. The specific benefits are as<br>
follows:<br>
1. Improvement in cast structure through increased volume of equiexed<br>
grains,<br>
2. Reduced degree of macro-inclusions, specifically in the central portion<br>
of cross sections,<br>
3. Improved surface quality and<br>
4. Reduced shrinkage porosity.<br>
In addition, inclusion re-distribution and removal is an often mentioned, but<br>
seldom unambiguously demonstrates benefits of electro magnetic stirring (EMS)<br>
of continuous casting steel(1).<br>
Electro magnetic stirring (EMS) facility is installed at a high capital investment<br>
in order to improve the continuous casting bilIet quality. It is highly desirable to<br>
assess the effectiveness of this system in improving the billet quality particularly<br>
by non-destructive evaluation techniques.<br>
Due to ever increasing demand of cleaner and cleaner steel from customer,<br>
steel producers are facing too much constraint in always changing and<br>
optimizing their process parameters in order to attain the product leadership in<br>
the market. The effectiveness of the change in the process parameters should<br>
be carefully measured in order to exactly know the extent of improvement in<br>
equiaxed zone and reduction in flaws.<br>
THEORETICAL ASPECTS:<br>
Dendrite Selidification(9):<br>
Solidification may be of plane front or dendrite front, but in steel dendrite<br>
solidification exists. Any solidification step will be as a plane front, but later<br>
either continues that way or change into cellular or dendrite type.<br>
Dendrite means 'tree-like' and it has stem, branches, sub-branches (known as<br>
primary, secondary and tertiary arms). According to Flemings, dendrite may be<br>
said to form when secondary arms appear. Dendrite arm spacing is an<br>
important parameter in the morphology of cast structure.<br>
Chill Zone<br>
This consists of equiaxtd crystal and randomly oritnted dendrites (Fig. 1). As<br>
soon as the molten metal comes in contact with mould wall, there is rapid<br>
chilling of the outer layer. This under cools liquid, below its equilibrium liquidous<br>
temperature, from the theory of nucleation(10),<br><br>
Around a critical T', 'I' becomes so larger that the corresponding temperature is<br>
called nucleation temperature.<br>
Columnar Zone:<br>
When the under cooling is low i.e. the temperature of the liquid is above the<br>
nucleation temperature, further nucleation almost ceases and growth starts from<br>
the existing crystal at solid liquid interlace. Such growth preferentially takes<br>
place along the heat flow direction which gives rise to the columnar zone. Since,<br>
the number of crystal becomes fewer as we move inwards, the grain size also<br>
increase. Dendrites located near the outer chill zone have more random<br>
orientation than these further inward in the columnar zone. Columnar zone also<br>
contains some equiaxed crystals (10). A conventional and widely used measure of<br>
the effects of solidification conditions on dendrite structure is 'Dendrite Arm<br>
Spacing (?). Measurements are more conveniently done on secondary arms(11).<br>
For low alloy carbon steel with solidification,<br><br>
where, a in mm, R in mm / h and G in ° C / cm.<br><br>
For steel containing 0.6% C, ?2 = 0.0158 Qf044 and for 1.5 % C, ?2 = 0.0072 Qf0.50<br>
Equiaxed Zone :<br>
In this zone, the equiaxed crystal as well as the dendrites are oriented at<br>
random. Chalmers have reviewed the findings up to early sixties. Two theories<br>
have been proposed till then.<br>
1. The first theory by Winegard and Chalmers says the nucleation of the<br>
crystal in the equiaxed zone occurs when the liquid reaches its nucleation<br>
temperature, as a result of constitutional super cooling. The subsequent<br>
rapid growth of these prevents further advancement of columnar zone.<br>
2. According to second theory, nucleation occurs in the outer chili zone.<br>
Some of crystal thus formed break, survive and float in the remaining<br>
liquid and later on provide the necessary nuclei for growth in the equiaxed<br>
zone when constitutional super cooling ceases.<br>
Chalmers presented several evidences in favour of the latter mechanism such as<br>
presence of small equiaxed crystal in columnar zone. In his experience he<br>
exhibits unusually large grain size pointing out to nucleation difficulties. W R<br>
frying et. al.(12) presented correlation of % equiaxed with degree of super heat<br>
and chemical composition in continuously cast steel as given below.<br>
Equiaxed structure (%) = 1.21 ?T (° K) + 109 % C - 21 % Si - 32 % Mn - 95 %<br>
P-186 % S + 25.8 for the composition within the range of 0.25 % C.<br>
Detectabillity of colummar / Equiaxed Transition Zone in Steel(13):<br>
Changes in wave propagation speed and energy losses from interaction with<br>
material microstructure are two key factors in ultrasonic determination of<br>
material microstructure and material properties. Ultrasonic velocity and<br>
attenuation measurement are bask. Relatively small variation of velocity and<br>
attenuation are often associated with significant variation in microstructural<br>
characteristics and mechanical properties.<br>
Scattering and absorption are the energy loss mechanism that governs ultrasonic<br>
attenuation in the frequency ranges of interest of characterizing most<br>
engineering solid. Diffusion, Rayleigh and Stochastic (Phase) scattering losses<br>
are extrinsic to individual grains such as crystallites.<br>
Extrinsic Mechanism<br>
Scattering usually accounts for the great portion of losses in engineering solids.<br>
The scatter attenuation coefficient a is function of frequency 'f' and usually<br>
expressed in the term of the intensity 'I' of sound after traversing a distance X<br>
though a material:<br><br>
In poly crystalline aggregates (metals and ceramics), there are three scatter<br>
attenuation processes defined by the ratio of mean grain size D to the dominant<br>
wavelength a.<br>
For the Raleigh Kettering process where ? &gt; &gt;nD ;<br><br>
In this case, excessive scattering may cause drop in back-wall echo.<br><br>
In this case, scattering may cause slightly lest drop in back-wall echo % if<br>
compare with the same in case of Raleigh scattering process.<br><br>
In this case, there is a small fraction of scattering, which may causa incraasa in<br>
back-wall echo.<br>
The constant Cr, Cp and Cd contain geometric factors, longitudinal and transverse<br>
velocities, density and elastic anisotropy factors.<br>
The above grain scattering formulae are not valid for the columnar / dendritic<br>
structure. However the morphology of such structure will affect the ultrasonic<br>
losses. A dendritic structure will scatter more ultrasonic energy than columnar.<br>
Large equiaxed grains will scatter more than small equiaxed grains as per the<br>
grain scattering formula as mentioned in above equations.<br>

indicated by number of back scattered signals was performed on each and every<br>
band as shown in Figure 2 by using 6 MHz, 15 mm dia., twin crystal normal<br>
probe.<br>
On each band (A, B, C, D, E &amp; F) of the sample, the total numbers of flaw<br>
echoes were noted. For each sample, the total number of flaws (Ntotal) was<br>
calculated as given below :<br>
(Ntotal) - (NA + NB + NC + ND + NE + NF)<br>
The total flaws for each sample, were tabulated and reported. Increase in value<br>
of Ntotal indicates increase in dirtiness of the steel.<br>
Identification of equtexed / columnar transition: The equiaxed /<br>
columnar zone in test samples was assessed by subsequent change in ultrasonic<br>
back-wall echo amplitude using 10 MHz, 15 mm dia., single crystal normal probe<br>
as shown in the Figure 3. After every 5 mm increment on the shown band<br>
(Figure 3), the amplitude of the back-wall indications were noted. The noted<br>
results, for each sample, were tabulated and reported. The verification of<br>
ultrasonic results was done by macro-etch test.<br>
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:<br>
Evaluation af WR-3 grade af continuausly cast billets:<br>
Total flaws: Zones A and B towards the inner radius (top surface) and E and<br>
F towards the outer radius (bottom surface) of the strand showed less flaws in<br>
electro magnetic stirring (EMS) billet when compared with non-electro magnetic<br>
stirring (Non- EMS) billet. The scanned zone C and D towards the central portion<br>
of the strand show more flaws in EMS billet when compared with non-electro<br>
magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) billet (Figs. 4,6,8 &amp; 9).<br>
Equiaxed zone: There was no clear indication of equiaxed zone in<br>
non-electro magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) sample whereas in electro magnetic<br>
stirring (EMS) sample, there was an indication of a small equiaxed zone<br>
(15 x 10 mm) which was found away from the center and towards the radius<br>
(Figures 5,6,8 &amp; 9),<br>
evaluation of PC-118 grade of continuously cast billets:<br>
Total flaws: Zones A and E of the billets sample were found to contain lass<br>
flaws in electro magnetic stirring (EMS) billet when compared with non-electro<br>
magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) billet. The scanned zone C and D towards the<br>
central portion of the strand showed no flaw (Figures 10,12,13 &amp; 15).<br>
Equiaxed zone : There is an indication of a small equiaxed zone (approx.<br>
25mm x 25 mm) in non-electro magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) sample whereas in<br>
electro magnetic stirring (EMS) sample, there is an indication of a comparatively<br>
larger equiaxed zone (approx. 50 mm x 50 mm ) (Figures 11,12,14 &amp; 15).<br>
Evaluation of 7S/80 Grades of Continuously Cat IHIets:<br>
Total flaws : Zones A and E of the billet samples were found to contain less<br>
flaws in electro magnetic stirring (EMS) billet when compared with non-electro<br>
magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) billet. The scanned zone C and D towards the<br>
central portion of the strand showed no flaw (Figures 22,24,25 &amp; 27).<br>
Equiaxed lone: There is an indication of a small (approx. 20 mm x 20 mm)<br>
equiaxed zone in non-electro magnetic stirring (Non-EMS) sample whereas in<br>
electro magnetic stirring (EMS) sample, there is an indication of a comparatively<br>
larger (approx. 40 mm x 40 mm) equiaxed zone (Figures 23,24,26 &amp; 27).<br>
A non-destructive ultrasonic technique has been developed for study the effect<br>
of electro magnetic-stirring (EMS) on macro-structure of continuously cast billets,<br>
which will assist in modifying the process parameters to improve the billet<br>
quality.<br>
