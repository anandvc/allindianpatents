				<td>Field Of The Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for interfacing devices in<br>
chromatography. More specifically, the invention relates to a system for<br>
interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph that preconcentrates the<br>
5analytes to be measured.<br>
Background Of The Invention<br>
Chromatography is essentially a physical method of separation in which<br>
constituents of a test sample in a carrier gas or liquid are adsorbed or absorbed<br>
and then desorbed by a stationary phase material in a column. A pulse of the<br>
sample is introduced into a steady flow of carrier gas, which carries the sample<br>
lOinto a chromatographic column. The inside of the column is lined with a liquid,<br>
and interactions between this liquid and the various elements of the sample—<br>
which differ based upon differences among distribution coefficients of the<br>
elements—cause the sample to be separated into the respective elements. At<br>
the end of the column, the individual components are more or less separated in<br>
15time. Detection of the gas provides a time-scaled pattern, typically called a<br>
chtomatogram, that, by calibration or comparison with known samples, indicates<br>
the constituents of the test sample. An example of the process by which this<br>
occurs is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,252 to Hinshaw.<br>
Often, the sample is first obtained using a sampling device, which<br>
20subsequently transfers the sample to the chromatograph. One means of<br>
obtaining a sample and introducing it into a chromatographic column is known as<br>
"headspace sampling." In conventional headspace sampling, sample material is<br>
sealed in a vial and subjected to constant temperature conditions for a specified<br>
time. Analyte concentrations in the vial gas phase should reach equilibrium with<br>
25the liquid and/or solid phases during this thermostatting time. The vial is<br>
subsequently pressurized with carrier gas to a level greater than the "natural"<br>
interna pressure resulting from thermostatting and equilibration. Then the<br>
pressurized vial is connected to the chromatographic column in such a way as to<br>
allow for the transfer of a portion of the vial gas phase into the column for a short<br>
period of time. An example of such a sampling device is disclosed in U.S.<br>
5Patent No. 4,484,483 to Riegger et. at. An example of a chromatographic<br>
system employing such a sampling device is disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,711,786 to Hinshaw, which describes using a chromatographic injector<br>
between the vial and the chromatographic column.<br>
Typically, it is desired to pre-concentrate the analytes in the sample, and<br>
10occasionally, remove moisture therefrom, prior to introducing the sample into the<br>
chromatographic column. Accordingly, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,792,423 and 6,395,560 to Markelov, these systems will typically include some<br>
kind of "trap" for this purpose, which retains the analytes as they are carried<br>
through the trap, and which are later released from the trap, usually by heating,<br>
15and swept into the chromatographic column.<br>
Various types of traps have been suggested to perform this pre-<br>
concentration (and possible moisture removal) prior to introducing the sample<br>
into a chromatographic column. Often, it is advantageous to use an adsorbent<br>
trap of some sort to adsorb the analytes, which can later be desorbed, as<br>
20opposed to an absorbent because, since the anhydrous substance absorbs<br>
water, repeated use of the anhydrous substance is likely to be limited and<br>
require frequent replacement. Accordingly, numerous arrangements employing<br>
an adsorbent trap have been employed for the purpose of pre-concentrating the<br>
analytes of a sample extracted by a sampling device such as a headspace<br>
25sampler. Examples of such arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,932,482 to Markelov and U.S. Patent No. 6,652,625 to Tipler.<br>
However, to date, these systems have resulted in a number of<br>
disadvantages. First, in order to accomplish this multiple stage process of<br>
extracting a sample fluid, transferring it to the trap, trapping it and untrapping it,<br>
and transferring it to the chromatographic column, these systems have employed<br>
complex assemblies of parts and/or valves situated in the flow path of the fluid<br>
containing the analytes to be measured. These extra devices and valves not<br>
only increase cost and space, but increase dead-volume areas and surface<br>
5active sites. This results in sample dispersion, dilution, or loss, and causes<br>
excessive peak broadening on the chromatogram. Another disadvantage<br>
present in some of these systems is the uni-directional path of flow for both<br>
adsorption and desorption, inhibiting the ability to first trap heavier compounds<br>
and then more volatile compounds by using multiple adsorbents.<br>
10 What is desired, therefore, is a system for interfacing a sampling device<br>
and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating analytes in a sample prior to<br>
introducing the sample into the chromatographic column that is inexpensive to<br>
manufacture and does not take up a lot of space. What is further desired is a<br>
system for interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph and for pre-<br>
I5concentrating analytes in a sample prior to introducing the sample into the<br>
chromatographic column that reduces the amount of dead volume areas and<br>
surface active sites. What is also desired is a system for interfacing a sampling<br>
device and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating analytes in a sample prior<br>
to introducing the sample into the chromatographic column that facilitates the<br>
20use of multiple adsorbents.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a system for<br>
interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating<br>
analytes in a sample prior to introducing the sample into the chromatographic<br>
25column that minimizes the use of extra devices to trap and transfer the analytes<br>
in the sample to be measured.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a system for<br>
interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating<br>
analytes in a sample prior to introducing the sample into the chromatographic<br>
column that eliminates the use of valves in the flow path of the analytes to be<br>
measured.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system for<br>
5interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating<br>
analytes in a sample prior to introducing the sample into the chromatographic<br>
column that where the sampling device, adsorbent trap, and chromatograph are<br>
in very close proximity to one another.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a system for<br>
10interfacing a sampling device and a chromatograph and for pre-concentrating<br>
analytes in a sample prior to introducing the sample into the chromatographic<br>
column that adsorbs analytes as fluid carrying the analytes flows in one direction<br>
and desorbs the analytes as fluid flows in the opposite direction.<br>
To overcome the deficiencies of the prior art and to achieve at least some<br>
15of the objects and advantages listed, the invention comprises an interface<br>
assembly for pre-concentrating analytes in chromatography, including an<br>
interface housing having a first end and a second end, wherein the first end is<br>
adapted to be coupled to a sampling device and the second end is adapted to be<br>
coupled to a chromatograph, and wherein the interface housing has a first flow<br>
20c hannel, an adsorbent housing connected to the interface housing, the<br>
adsorbent housing having a second flow channel, an inlet, and an outlet, a first<br>
vaiveless conduit through which fluid is communicated between the sampling<br>
device and the first flow channel, a second vaiveless conduit through which fluid<br>
is communicated between the first flow channel and the second flow channel, a<br>
25third vaiveless conduit through which fluid is communicated from the first flow<br>
channel to the chromatograph, and at least one adsorbent disposed in the<br>
second flow channel such that the adsorbent adsorbs analytes when fluid<br>
carrying the analytes flows through the second vaiveless conduit, through the<br>
second flow channel, and through the outlet, and the adsorbent desorbs the<br>
analytes when fluid flows through the inlet, through the second flow channel, and<br>
through the second valveless conduit. <br><br>

Detailed Description Of The Drawings<br>
The basic components of one embodiment of an interface assembly for<br>
pre-concentrating analytes 10 in accordance with the invention are illustrated in<br>
Figure 1. As used in the description, the terms "top," "bottom," "above," "below,"<br>
'over,'1 "under," "on top," "underneath," "up," "down," "upper," "lower," "front,"<br>
20"rear," "forward" and "back" refer to the objects referenced when in the<br>
orientation illustrated in the drawings, which orientation is not necessary for<br>
achieving the objects of the invention.<br>
The interface assembly 10 includes an interface housing 20 and an<br>
adsorbent housing 22 connected thereto. In certain advantageous<br>
25embodiments, the interface housing 20 and the adsorbent housing 22 have<br>
corresponding threaded portions so that the adsorbent housing 22 can be easily<br>
20<br>
connected to and removed from the system (as shown in Figure 6). However, in<br>
other embodiments, the adsorbent housing 22 may be connected to the system<br>
via any other means providing an adequate seal such that fluid leakage does not<br>
occur, and in some cases, the adsorbent housing 22 is even integrally formed<br>
5with the interface housing 20.<br>
The interface housing 10 has a first end 24 and a second end 26. The<br>
 first end 24 is adapted to be coupled to sampling device, such as, for example, a<br>
headspace sampler. The second end 26 is adapted to be coupled to a<br>
chromatograph. This may be accomplished, for example, by the use of a column<br>
10port 28 in the interface housing 20 for receiving the end of a chromatographic<br>
column.<br>
The sampling device to which the first end 24 of the interface housing 20<br>
is coupled will typically include some vessel or area for holding and/or extracting<br>
, a sample containing analytes to be measured. For example, referring to Figure<br>
52, the sampling device may include a sampling needle 30 and a sample chambei<br>
 32, where the sampling needle has a vessel port 34 through which fluid is<br>
 communicated between the needle 30 and a vessel 38 and a sample chambe<br>
 port 36 through which fluid is communicated between the needle 30 the sample<br>
chamber 32.<br>
20 The interface housing 20 has a first flow channel 40 therein, and a first<br>
 valveless conduit 42 permits fluid to be communicated between the sample<br>
 chamber 32 and first flow channel 40. The adsorbent housing 22 has a second<br>
 flow channel 44, and a second valveless conduit 46 permits fluid to be<br>
 communicated between the first flow channel 40 and the second flow channel<br><br>
 As noted above, in some embodiments, the interface housing 20 has a<br>
column port 28 for receiving the end of a chromatographic column 50 A third<br>
valveless conduit 48 permits fluid to be communicated between the first flow <br>
channel 40 and the column 50. The third valveless conduit 48 may comprise a<br>
channel of the column port 28 that is in fluid communication with the first flow<br>
channel 40 and is especially adapted for receiving the end of the column 50, or it<br>
may comprise a portion of the first flow channel 40 adjacent to the end of the<br>
column 50, or it may simply be the end of the column 50 itself.<br>
5 At feast one adsorbent 60 is disposed in the second flow channe 44 in<br>
order to adsorb the analytes in the sample as the sample fluid passes through<br>
the second valveless conduit 46 and down through the second flow channel 44.<br>
In certain advantageous embodiments, a weaker adsorbent 62 is positioned<br>
between the second valveless conduit 46 and the adsorbent 60. Accordingly, as<br>
10the sample fluid passes, through the second valveless conduit 46 and down<br>
through the second flow channel 44, the weaker adsorbent 62 first adsorb;; the<br>
heavier compounds, and the stronger adsorbent 80 then adsorbs the more<br>
volatile compounds in the sample.<br>
In some embodiments, the adsorbents 60, 62 are hydrophobic, thereby<br>
15allowing moisture to be easily purged from the system by a carrier gas, as further<br>
explained below. In certain advantageous embodiments, graphitized carbon<br>
black is used as an adsorbent, in some embodiments, a polymer cadsorbent is<br>
used. In certain embodiments, a carbon molecular sieve is used.<br>
The examples of polymeric adsorbent include Tenax TA (2,6-diphenylene-<br>
oxide polymer resin } and the Chromosorb adsorbents. The weakest adsorbents are<br>
things such as glass beads and silicon oil. Polymeric adsorbents are stronger than<br>
those, and carbonaceous adsorbents are even stronger than polymeric ones. Arr ong<br>
the carbonaceous adsorbents, carbon molecular sieves will be the strongest. One<br>
example that could be used in the present invention is a graphitized carbon black as<br>
the weaker adsorbent, and a Carboxen as the stronger adsorbent.<br>
In some embodiments, the adsorbent housing 22 is temperature<br>
controllable. Accordingly, the housing 22 can be heated to desorb analytes that<br>
have been retained by the adsorbents 60, 62 before a fluid sweeps them out of<br>
the housing 22 and into the column 50.<br>
The adsorbent housing 22 has an inlet 64 and an outlet 66. In certain<br>
advantageous embodiments, the inlet 64 and outlet 66 both communicate with<br>
"the second flow channel 44 via a common passage 68, and a single valve 70<br>
switches between the inlet 64 and the outlet 66. However, in other<br>
embodiments, separate passages and valves are used to provide for the inlet<br>
and outlet of fluid to and from the second flow channel 44.<br>
The interface housing 20 has a first inlet 72 for generally providing needed<br>
fluid to the system. For instance, the first inlet 72 may provide carrier gas to<br>
different parts of the system at different stages of operation, such as, for<br>
example, by providing the sampling device with fluid to pressurize the vessel 38,<br>
5or, as another example, by providing carrier gas to the adsorbent housing 22 to<br>
carry a sample containing analytes thereto or to sweep away moisture contained<br>
therein. The interface housing 20 also has a second inlet 74 for providing fluid<br>
that may be used by various parts of the system at various stages, but primarily<br>
for isolating the chromatographic column 50 from the rest of the system in order<br>
10to keep fluid from entering the column 50 until it is specifically desired to desorb<br>
the analytes thereinto. Valves 76, 78 are provided to open and close inlets 72,<br>
74, respectively.<br>
In some embodiments, the interface housing 22 has first and second<br>
portions 82, 84 (as shown in Figure 1), which can be coupled together, where the<br>
15first portion 82 includes the first inlet 72 and the second portion 84 includes the<br>
second inlet 74. It should be noted that, in these and other embodiments, the<br>
first flow channel 40 may be comprised of multiple sub-channels in various<br>
interface housing portions (such as portions 82, 84), and of varying shapes and<br>
thicknesses, which, in conjunction, form a continuous channel.<br>
20 Operation of the above described assembly is illustrated stepwise in<br>
Figures 2-6. A pressurization step is illustrated in Figure 2. As shown therein,<br>
the sampling needle descends into the vessel 38, bringing the vessel port 34 into<br>
fluid communication with the interior of the vessel 38. The inlets 76, 78, and 64<br>
are all open, sending fluid into the sample chamber 32, through the chamber port<br>
2536, down through the needle 30, and into the vessel 38 (indicated by arrows A).<br>
In this way, the vessel is pressurized.<br>
A trap load step is illustrated in Figure 3. As shown therein, the inlet valve<br>
73 is closed, terminating the supply of fluid from the inlet 72. Likewise, the valve<br>
70 terminates the supply of fluid from inlet 64, and opens the outlet 66. As a<br>
result, fluid containing the analytes to be measured elute from the vessel 38<br>
through the vessel port 34, through the needle 30, out the chamber port 36, into<br>
the first flow channel 40, into the second flow channel 44 and through the<br>
adsorbents 62, 60, which adsorb the analytes before the fluid is discharged<br>
5through the outlet 66 (indicated by arrows B). The inlet valve 78 remains open,<br>
allowing fluid to continue to enter through the inlet 74 and isolate the column 50<br>
(indicated by arrows C).<br>
h embodiments where a significant amount of moisture is present in the<br>
sample being analyzed, a dry purge step may be desired, which is illustrated in<br>
10Figure 4. As shown, the needle 30 is withdrawn from the vessel 38, bringing the<br>
vessel port 34 above the seal 90. The inlet valve 76 is opened again, thereby<br>
allowing fluid to once again enter the system via the inlet 72. The fluid flows into<br>
the first flow channel 40, into the second flow channel 44 and through the<br>
adsorbents 62, 60, sweeping any moisture therein out through the outlet 66<br>
15(indicated by arrows D). Once again, the inlet valve 78 remains open, allowing<br>
fluid to continue to enter through the inlet 74 and isolate the column 50 (indicated<br>
by arrows E).<br>
A desorption step is illustrated in Figure 5. As shown therein, the valves<br>
76, 78 are closed, terminating the supply of fluid from inlets 72, 74. The valve 70<br>
20closes the outlet 66 and re-opens the inlet 64. The adsorbent housing 22 is<br>
neated to desorb the analytes retained by the adsorbents 62, 60. Fluid enters<br>
through the inlet 64, flows into the second flow chamber 44, sweeping the<br>
desorbed analytes into the first flow chamber 40 and into the chromatographic<br>
column 50 (indicated by arrows F).<br>
25 Figure 6 illustrates an arrangement for system maintenance when the<br>
sampling device or the adsorbent housing 22 is disconnected from the interface<br>
housing 20. As shown therein, the valve 76 remains closed. The inlet valve 78<br>
remains open, allowing fluid to enter through the inlet 74 and flow past the inlet<br>
35<br>
of the column 50 to prevent ambient air from entering the column (indicated by<br>
arrows G).<br>
In certain advantageous embodiments, the first flow channel 40 will have<br>
a very small inner diameter in order to minimize the surface area over which the<br>
5sample containing the analytes flows and to help prevent any flow resulting from<br>
dispersion that may otherwise flow back towards the sample chamber 32 during<br>
the trap desorption stage illustrated in Figure 5. In some embodiments, this<br>
inner diameter is between 0.1 and 1.0 mm, and in certain advantageous<br>
embodiments, is about 0.5 mm.<br>
10 It should be understood that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting,<br>
and that obvious modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit of the invention. Accordingly, reference should be made<br>
primarily to the accompanying claims, rather than the foregoing specification, to<br>
determine the scope of the invention.<br>
