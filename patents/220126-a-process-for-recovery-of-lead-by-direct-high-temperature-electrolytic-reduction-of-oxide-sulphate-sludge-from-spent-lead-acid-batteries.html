The utility of the invention is the direct recovery of lead from the oxide-sulphate sludge in spent lead acid batteries. It is a single stage high temperature electrolytic reduction process, which does not require to convert insoluble lead sulphate and lead oxides into leachable products used for recovery of lead by other electrolytic process.

Reference may be made to various technologies as given above which are available for the recovery of lead from spent lead acid batteries by Hydro and Electrolytic processes where in all these processes the sludge from the spent lead acid batteries such as lead sulphate and lead oxide are converted into teachable lead carbonate or hydroxide. The products obtained are leached by electrolyte such as fluosilicic acid/ fluoboric acid/HCI brine solution, which is followed by electrowinning with an insoluble anode. In the ELTA lead recycling process , the crushed oxide-sulphate mixture is desulphurised to remove the sulphate ions and to convert all of the lead to the oxide or hydroxide form. The lead is extracted using hydrometallurgical process. Thus, these processes involve several steps for the recovery of lead.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for recovery of lead by direct high temperature electrolytic reduction of oxide-sulphate sludge from spent lead acid batteries" which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process of recovery of lead by direct high temperature electrolytic reduction of oxide-sulphate sludge from spent lead acid<br>
batteries which comprises an electrolytic cell consisting of a mild steel crucible<br>
containing melt of alkali hydroxide such as herein described as cathode and the cell is kept inside a tubular furnace with temperature controller to maintain the bath temperature at 450°C to 500 °C with anode being a mild steel tube introduced from the top from an electrode holding stand and is centrally positioned into the melt containing the oxide-sulphate sludge material from the plates, fed into the melt little by little till its concentration in the melt is 10 to 15% and direct current is impressed through the electrodes at the current densities ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 A/cm2, removing lead and subsequently purifying in commercial grade calcium chloride bath at 850°C to remove impurities alkali metal such as sodium, potassium, iron and calcium with a tubular suction arrangement placed over the set up for removing any fumes if evolved during melting and electrolysis.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the alkali hydroxide used may be selected from KOH, NaOH.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the preferred bath temperature may be at 450 °C.<br>
The process comprises of an electrolytic cell made of a mild steel crucible of 13 cm diameter and 20 cm height. This crucible acts as the cathode. The electrolyte used is sodium hydroxide melt. The crucible with the melt is kept inside a tubular furnace with temperature controller to maintain the bath temperature at 450°C. The anode is a mild steel tube of 4.5 cm diameter and is introduced from the top of an electrode holding stand and is positioned centrally in the melt. The oxide-sulphate sludge material from the plate is fed into the melt little by little till its concentration is raised to 10 to 15%. Direct current is impressed through the electrodes at particular current density. Lead forms a pool at the bottom of the cathode which can be removed by means of ladle. The pool of lead obtained is further refined in commercial grade CaCI2 bath at 850°C to remove the impurities such as sodium, iron and calcium. A tubular suction arrangement<br>
can also be placed over the set up for removing any fumes if evolved during melting and<br>
electrolysis.<br>
