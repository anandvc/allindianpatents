				<td>BACKGROND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to CDMA mobile communication systems, and in particular, to a device and method for performing gated transmission (or intermittent transmission) in a control hold state.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
A conventional Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) mobile communication system based on the IS-95 standard primarily supports a voice service. However, a mobile communication system in accordance with the IMT-2000 standard will support not only the voice service, but also a high-speed data transfer service. For example, the IMT-2000 standard can support a high-quality voice service, a moving picture service, an Internet search service, etc.<br>
In a mobile communication system, a data communication service is characterized in that transmissions of burst data alternate with long non-transmission periods. Therefore, for the data communication service, a mobile communication system employs a channel<br>
1A<br><br>
assignment method in which a dedicated channel is assigned for only the data transmission duration. That is, taking into consideration the limited radio resources, base station capacity and power consumption of a mobile station, the mobile communication system connects a traffic channel and a control channel only for an actual data transmission duration and otherwise releases the dedicated channels (i.e.. the traffic channel and the control channel) when there is no data to transmit for a predetermined time. When the dedicated channels are released, communication is performed through a common channel, thus increasing utility efficiency of the radio resources.<br>
A conventional CDMA mobile communication system which mainly supports the voice service, releases a traffic channel upon completion of data transmission and then, reconnect the traffic channel when it is required to transmit data However, the conventional channel assignment method is not suitable for a packet data service because of a time delay for reconnection of the channel. Therefore, to provide the packet data service as well as the voice service, there is required a new channel assignment method.<br>
In general, during the packet data service, data transmission occurs intermittently. Therefore, a transmission duration of packet data alternates with periods of non-transmission. The mobile communication system either releases or maintains a channel in use for the periods of non-transmission, However, there are drawbacks associated with both maintaining and releasing a channel, namely, release of the channel causes an increase in service time due to a time delay for reconnection of the channel, and maintaining the channel causes a waste of the channel resources.<br>
-   2   -<br><br>
To solve these problems, there is proposed a method in which a dedicated control channel is provided between a base station and a mobile station to exchange traffic channel-related control signals over the dedicated control channel for the data transmission duration; and release the traffic channel and maintain only the dedicated control channel for the non-transmission duration. In this manner, the mobile communication system can prevent a waste of the channel resources and rapidly reconnect the traffic channel when there is data to transmit. The operating state described above is called a control hold state.<br>
The mobile communication system includes additional operating states according to the channel assignment. FIG. 10 illustrates a state transition diagram of a mobile communication system for the packet service.<br>
As shown in FIG. 10, for the packet service, the state transition diagram for the packet service illustrates a packet null state, an initialization state, an active state, a control hold state, e suspended state, a dormant state and a reconnect state. In the control hold, active and suspended stales, a service: option is connected and in the other stales, the service option is not connected.<br>
Further, the control hold state can be divided into a normal substate and a slotted substatej. as shown in FIG. 11. The normal substate refers to a state where there is no data to transmit over a traffic channel and only a control signal is exchanged over a dedicated control channel. When the normal substate continues for a predetermined time, (i.e., when onlythe control signal is exchanged for a predetermined time without transmission of data). a transition to the sletted substate occurs. The slotted substate refers to a state where<br>
-   3   -<br><br>
connection of the dedicated control channel is maintained but no control signal is exchanged over the dedicated control channel to reduce power consumption of a mobile station-However, to make a transition from the slotted sub state to the normal subslate to restart data transmission, resynchronization should be performed between a base station and a mobile station, since no control signal is exchanged between the base station and the mobile station in the slotted substate.<br>
A reference will now be made to a base station and a mobile station for (he conventional CDMA communication system which performs the above operations. FIG. 1A illustrates a conventional base station transmitter in a CDMA communication system.<br>
With regard to forward link channels, the base station includes a pilot channel for sync acquisition and channel estimation, a forward common control channel (F-CCH) for communicating a control message in common to all the mobile stations located in a cell (or service) area of the base station a forward dedicated control channel (F-DCCH) for exclusively com municating a control message to a specific mobile station located in the cell area of the base suition, and a forward dedicated traffic channel (F-DTCH) for exclusively communicating traffic data (i.e., voice and packet data) 10 a specific motile station located in the cell area of the base station. The forward dedicated control channel includes sharable forward dedicated contro. channel (sharable F-DCCH) for exclusively communiceting a control message to a specific mobile station by time slot muttiplexing. The forward dedicated traffic channel includes a forward fundamental channel (F-F OH) and a forward supplemental channel (F-SCH).<br>
-  4  -<br><br>
Demultiplexers 120, 122, 124 and 126 demultiplex corresponding channel-coded interleaved channel information to I and Q channels. Here, serial-to-parallel converters can be used for the demultiplexers 120,122,124 and 126. It is assumed herein that signals input to the demultiplexers 120, 122, 124 and 126 arc signal-mapped signals. Mixers 110. 130, 131, 132, 133, 134. 135, 136 and 137 multiply signals output from the associated demultiplexers by orthogonal codes assigned to the corresponding channels to orthogonally spread the signals output from the associated demultiplexers. Here, each of the mixers 110 nnd 130-137 serves as an orthogonal modulator. The orthogonally spread signals output from the mixers 130-137 are gam controlled by associated amplifiers 140-147.<br>
Signals output from the amplifiers 140-147 and the mixer 110 are summed by summers  150 and 152 according to the 1 and Q channels. Since the signals applied to the summers 150 and 152 were channel separated by the orthogonal codes, the respective channel signals are orthogonal to one another. Outputs of the summers 150 and 152 are multiplied by PN (PSCIKIO Noise) sequences PN (and PN#Q assigned to the base station for .base station identification in a complex multiplier 160<br>

The outputs of the filters 170 and 171 arc amplified by amplifiers 172 and 173. Mixers 174 and 175 multiply outputs of the amplifiers 172 and 173 by a carrier cos(2 ft) to up-convert the signals to radio frequency (RF) signals. A summer 180 sums the<br>

FIG. 1B illustrates a conventional mobile station transmitter for the conventional CDMA communication system. With regard to reverse link channels, the mobile station includes a pilot/PCB (Power Control Bit) channel for multiplexing a pilot channel for sync acquisition and channel estimation and a forward power control bit for forward power control, a reverse dedicated control channel (R-DCCH) for exclusively communicating a control message to a base station, in a cell area of which the mobile station is located, and a reverse dedicated traffic channel (R-DTCH) for exclusively communicating traffic data to the base station Further, the reverse dedicated traffic channel includes a reverse fundamental channel (R-FCH) and a reverse supplemental channel (R-SCH).<br>
A multiplexer 210 multiplexes a signal on the reverse pilot channel and a power control bil for controlling power of the forward link. Mixers 220, 230, 240. 250 and 260 multiply corresponding channel-coded interleaved signals received over the respective reverse channel by orthogonal codes assigned to the corresponding channels to generate orthogonally spread signals for the respective channels. Outputs of the mixers 220,240,250 and 260 arc gain controlled by amplifiers 222.242. 232 and 262. respectively.<br>
A summer 224 sums outputs of the amplifiers 222 and 242 and an output of the multiplier 230, and u summer 254 sums outputs of the amplifiers 252 and 262. Since the signals applied to the summers 224 and 254 were channel separated by the orthogonal codes, the respective channel signals are orthogonal to one another. A cemplex spreader for complex multiplier) 160 multiplies signals output from the summers 27.4 and 254 by a spreading code assigned to the mobile station to spread the signals. The spreading code assigned to the mobile station is generated by mixing a PN sequence for a base station, in<br>

the cell area of which the mobile station is located, by a unique long code for the mobile station. Filters 170 and 171 filter I and Q channel signals output from the complex spreader 160. respectively, to generate bandwidth suppressed signals. Amplifiers 172 and 173 amplify outputs of the filters 170 and 171, respectively. Mixers 174 and 175 multiply signals output from the amplifiers 172 and 173 by a earner cos(2f ct) to up-convert the transmission signals to RF signals. A summer 180 sums the 1 and Q channel signals output from the mixers 174 and 175.<br>
In the control hold state of the conventional CDMA communication system, a dedicated traffic channel is released and a control signal is communicated over a dedicated control channel. A description will be provided regarding the operation of a reverse pilot/PCD channel in the control hold state. Herein, it is assumed that the control hold state is divided into a normal substate and a slotted substate. However, even in the case where the control hold state is not divided into the normal substate and the slotted substate, the reverse pilot/PCB channel will have the same operation<br>
First, a mobile station constantly transmits a signal on the reverse pilot/PCB channel in order to avoid resync acquisition performed at a base station during a transition from the control hold state/normal substate (i.e., a normal substate of the control hold state) to the active state in a conventional CDMA communication system. The reverse pilot/PCB channel discontinues transmission only when a transition to the control hold stale/slotted substate (i.e., a slotted substate of the control hold state) occurs. However, the signal on the reverse pilot/PCB channel is continuously transmitted until the occurrence of the transition to the slotted substate occurs, thereby increasing interference of a reverse link in the normal<br>
-    7   -<br><br>
subscatc of the control hold stale. The increase in interference of the reverse link inevitably decreases a capacity of the reverse link. Further, the unnecessary continuous transmission of the control signal pauses an increase in power consumption.<br>
Second, a description will be made regarding an operation for generating a reverse dedicated control channel (R-DCCH) when a reverse dedicated MAC (Medium Access Control) channel is generated in the conventional control hold state/normal substaie. Logical channels for the reverse dedicated control channel include a dedicated MAC channel (dmch), a dedicated signalingchanncl (dsch)and a dedicated traffic channel (dtch) The dsch and dtch each have a 20ms frame and the dmch has a 5ms frame Therefore, after generation of the dmch, an R-DCCH can be transmitted within 5ms in maximum. Accordingly, the R-DCCH can be transmitted to locations which correspond to multiples of 5ms. Therefore, when the dmch is transmitted, the base station may determine the existence of the R-DCCH only at four locations within one frame. However, after generation of the dmch, the R-DCCH is transmitted with a lime delay of 5ms in maximum. The dmch has 2.5ms transmission delay on the average.<br>
Third, in the case where revers-e power control bits are disposed at fixed locations on a forward channel when the R-DCCH is not activated in the conventional control hold state/normal substate, both forward power control and reverse power control are performed at the same periods. Further, in the case where the reverse power control bits are disposed at variable locations within a power control group on the forward channel when the R-OCCH is not activated in the conventional control hold state/normal substate both reverse power control and forward power control arc performed at the same periods.<br>
-   8   -<br><br>
As staled above, the continuous transmission of the reverse pilot/PCB channel in the conventional control hold state/normal substate is advantageous in that the base station can avoid the resyne acquisition procedure. However, the continuous transmission increases interference of the reverse link, causing a reduction in capacity of the reverse link. Further, continuous transmission of the reverse power control bits over the forward link causes an increase in interference of the forward link and a decrease in capacity of the forward link, in addition, the continuous transmission of the reverse power control bits may increase power consumption.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a method capable of suppressing unnecessary transmission of a control signal in the control hold state so as to (1) minimize resync acquisition time; (2) minimize interference due to transmission of the reverse pilot/PCB channel, and (3) minimize interference due to transmission of reverse power control bits over the forward link.<br>

reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In an embodiment of a COMA communication system, a control signal is intermittently transmitted when there is no user data to transmit. Here, the control signal includes a power control bit (PCB) being transmitted over a forward channel, and a pilot signal and a power control bit being transmitted over a reverse link. Therefore, in accordance with the embodiment, a control signal is intermittently transmitted in a control hold state, thereby minimizing resync acquisition time caused by intermittent transmissions, and also minimizes an increase in interference due to unnecessary transmission of a reverse pilot/PCQ channel and an increase in interference due to unnecessary transmission of a reverse power control bit over a forward link.<br>
For example, in a synchronous CDMA-2000 system to which the present invention is applied, a frame length is 20ms and each frame includes 16 power control groups. Thus, each power control group is 1. 25ms and a frame length for a dedicated control channel is 5ms. It should he noted that the present invention can also be applied to a case where there is no user data to trarsmit in a UMTS system, which is a asynchronous IMT-2000 system. In the UMTS system, it is possible to transmit not only a power control bit for a dedicated physical common control channel (DPCCCH) for transmitting the control signal but also a pilot signal and a transport format combination indicator (TFCI).<br>
Although the present invention will He described with reference to an embodiment<br>
-    19   -<br><br>
which intermittently transmits a control signal in a control hold state in a CDMA mobile cornmunicBiion system, the present invention can also be applied to a case where information is intermittently transmitted to prevent ah increase in interference to radio links which may be caused by unnecessary transmission of a control signal and thus, to reduce power consumption<br>
A reference will now be made to a base station transmitter and a mobile station transmitter, which intermittently transmit control signals in a control hold state according to an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2A illustrates n base station transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. For simplicity, FIG. 2A does not illustrate channel coding ond interleaving stages of respective channel transmitters for F-CCCH, F^DCCH and F-DTCH.<br>
Referring to FIG 2A, the pilot channel, F-CCCH and F-DTCH have the same structure as those of FIO. I A. A gated transmission (or intermittent transmission) controller 1V0 generates a gating (or intermitting) control signal for gating (or intermitting) transmission of a dedicated control channel in a control hold state. The gated transmission controller 190 having a gating rate (i.e., duty cycle) and a gating pattern for gaied transmission in the control hold state, generate* a control signal for intermittently transmitting a transmission signal on the dedicated control channel at a time previously scheduled with a mobile station. Here, the dedicated control channel includes an F-DCCH andasharableF-DCCH.<br>
A demultiplexer I Yl demultiplexes a channel-coded interleaved con iroi signal on the<br>
-   20   -<br><br>
F-DCCH channel to 1 and Q channels. Here, a serial-to-parallel converter can be used for the demultiplexer 122. It is assumed herein that the demultiplexer 122 has a signal mapping function or receives a signal-mapped signal. Mixers 132 and 133 multiply signals output from the demultiplexer 122 by an orthogonal code W*y for the F-DCCH to orthogonally spread the signals. The mixers 132 and 133 serve as orthogonal modulators. The spread signals output from the mixers 132 and 133 are gain controlled by amplifiers 142 and 143, respectively. Switches 192 and 193 connected between output nodes of the amplifiers 142 and 143 and input nodes of summers 150 and 152, is switched in response to the gating control signal output from the gated transmission controller 190. Therefore, switches 192 and 193 intermittently transmit transmission signals on the dedicated control channel in response to the gating control signal output from the gated transmission controller 190. Instead of using the switches 192 and 193. it is also possible to control gains of the amplifiers 142 and 143 to obtain the result of gated transmission. That is, by setting a gain control signal applied to the amplifiers 142 and 143 to zero, it is possible to discontinue transmission of the dedicated control channel.<br>
The shamble F-DCCH has the same structure as that of the F-DCCH. The other structure of the dedicated control channel transmitter is the same as that shown in FIG. I A.<br>
The base station transmitter of FIG. 2A gates the outputs of amplifiers 142,143,144 and I4S for the forward dedicated control channel F-DCCH#y and the sharable forward dedicated control channel F-DCCH#z usingthe gated transmission controller 190 and gates (or switches) 192. 193. 194 and 195. That is, the gated transmission controller 190 allows a reverse power control bit to be transmitted at a power control group (i.e.. time slot<br>
-   21    -<br><br>
schedule) with the mobile station whoa the forward and reverse dedicated control channels arc not activated in the control hold state where there is no user data to exchange. When the reverse dedicated control channel is not activated (at a non-signaling transmission duration) in the control bold state, only a reverse power control hit within a forward power control group is transmitted, which is selected according to a gating pattern for the reverse pilot/PCB channel. The forward and reverse gating patterns arc the same, but there exists an offset therebetween for effective jpower control The offtel can be given as a system parameter.<br>
FIG. 2B illustrates a mobile station transmitter according to an embodiment of the present invention. For simplicity, FIG. 2 does not illustrate channel coding and interleaving stages ot respective channel transmitters for R-SCH, R-DCCH and R-fCH Therefore, the respective channel transmitters receive channel-coded interleaved signals.<br>
A gated transmission controller 290 generates a gating control signal for gating transmission of a reverse pilot/PCB channel in a control hold state. The gated transmission controller 290 having a gating rate and a gating pattern for performing gated transmission in the control hold state, generates a control signal for intermittently transmitting a transmission signal on the reverse pi tot/PC B channel at a time scheduled with the base station.<br>
A multiplexer 210 multiplexes a signal $a a reverse pilot channel and a power control bit for controlling power of a forward link. A mixer 230 multiplies the signal on the reverse piiot/PCB channel by an orchogonai code assigned to the pilot/PCB channel to generate an<br>
-   22   -<br><br>
orthogonally spread signal. A switch 232 connected between an output node of the mixer (230 and an input node of a summer 224. is switched in response to the gating control signal output from the gated transmission controller 290. Therefore, the switch 232 is switched according to the gating control signal from the gated transmission controller 290 to intermittently transmit a transmission signal on the pilot/PCB channel. Instead of using the switch 232, it is also possible to provide an amplifier at an output state of the reverse pilot/PCB channel and control a gain of the amplifier to obtain the result of gated transmission. That is, by setting a gain control signal applied to the amplifier to zero, it is possible to discontinue transmission of the reverse pilot/PCB channel.<br>
The other channel transmitters have the same structure as that of FIG IB.<br>
The mobiU itaiion transmitter oi'FIG. 2B includes the gated transmission controller 290 which cot itruis the "-wiicl" 232 tor lilting transmission of the reverse pilot/PCB channel. Since transmission of the reverse pils;/PC3 channel is necessary for sync detection, it is not possible to transmit other reverse channels at a location which precludes (i.e., d ^continues) the transmission of the pilot TCP ".

I: ;;hc*uW be noted ii&gt;8t ih .* gating rate and the gating time are previously scheduled between a base -lotion and a mobile station. Further, the gating rate is determined according to a channel condition. For example, the gating rate decreases from 1/2 to 1 /4 for a good channel condition and increases from 4/1 to 1/2 for a bad channel condition. The gating time depends on a transition method to the control hold state. That is. when a state transition OCCUR by traisnUt-r.g a 'tare transition message, it U possible ;o determine a gating Stan<br>

Although the present invention has been described with reference to an embodiment which performs gated transmission in the case where a transitions to a control hold state occurs because there is no user data to exchange for a predetermined time, the invention can also be applied to a case where a discontinuous transmission period continues for a long time in an active stale without transition to the control hold state<br>
