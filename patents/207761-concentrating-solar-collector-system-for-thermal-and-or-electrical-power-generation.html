The  Patent  Act,  1970 (39  of  1970)<br>
(Section 10;   Rule 13)<br>
"CONCENTRATING SOLAR COLLECTOR SYSTEM FOR THERMAL AND / OR ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION".<br>
M/S. CLIQUE DEVELOPMENTS PRIVATE LIMITED (A Joint Stock Company Registered under the Indian companies Act, 1956) having office at 501, Third Avenue" Apartments, Kasturba Cross Road No. 3, Borivali (East), Mumbai - 400 066, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed:<br>
1 9 MAR 2004<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a 'Concentrating Solar Collector System for Thermal and / or Electrical Power Generation*.<br>
Solar collector systems serve the purpose of collecting sun rays and converting the solar energy into heat or electrical energy. Existing solar collector systems have a flat, parabolic or spherical collector surface and use flat absorber surface or externally heated absorber surface in tube or disc form. These do not use flat space trusses to support the reflector facets. These existing solar collector systems have absorber surface shaped for internal reflection.<br>
The existing concentrating solar collector systems have the following disadvantages.<br>
The existing concentrating solar collector systems are structurally heavy since they use reflector surface in paraboloid or parabolic or spherical form.<br>
They are exposed to less insolation (solar energy input) because they can move only with some angle with the sun.<br>
The existing solar collector systems have considerable thermal losses.<br>
The present invention has been developed with the following objectives.<br>
The present invention should be structurally lighter than conventional solar collector<br>
systems.	, s.<br>
Further, it should be exposed to maximum solar energy input and should continuously track the sun.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in detail with help of figure 1 of<br>
accompanying drawing.	"	'<br>
-2-<br><br>
Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the present invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the planar support structure (1), supporting tower (2), reflector facets (3) and receiver (4).<br>
The present invention consists of a planar support structure (1) made of a symmetric or non-symmetric, polygonal or circular assembly of flat space trusses of steel or other structural material. This support structure is mounted on a two-axes-supporting single tower (2) in such a manner that it can rotate in two orthogonal directions. This planar support structure supports a collector area having reflector facets (3) made of glass or other material. These reflector facets are either flat or curved-in with a small angle, and are fixed at different angles or differentially inclined, together forming a set of paraboloids with common focus. A hat-shaped heat exchanger element is placed in front 'of the reflector facets. This is the receiver (4). In another embodiment of the present invention, there is a concentrated photovoltaic element in place of the said heat exchanger element. This heat exchanger element or concentrated photovoltaic element is placed such that it can move in angular or linear motion, same as or proportional to the above-mentioned assembly of reflector facets, or it can remain stationary. This element is connected through insulated pipes to a storage device. The storage device is connected to the usage point.<br>
The working of the present invention is as explained below.<br>
The solar rays fall directly on the reflector facetsj Since these reflector facets are fixed at different angles or differentially inclined with common focus,\the insolation (the in-coming rays from the sun) is reflected on to a smaller area,  sun-rays to a pojn^ The support structure can rotate in two orthogonal directions (that is, along two axes), hence it can continuously track the sun with the rays normal to the collector area. The hat-shaped heat exchanger element of the receiver either moves in angular or linear motion, same as or proportional to the reflector facets, or remains stationary. The solar rays reflected from the facets get concentrated at a point or a small area in the heat exchanger element. This solar energy is converted into thermal energy or electrical energy which is then carried to a storage device. Thermal energy is generated in heat exchanger element or<br>
-3-<br><br>
electrical energy is generated in concentrated photovoltaic element exposed to the concentrated sunrays. This energy is supplied in the quantity required at the application unit or storage unit through loss-resistant insulated pipes or conductor wires.<br>
The present invention has many advantages as mentioned below.<br>
The present solar collector system is structurally lighter compared to conventional solar collector systems since it uses flat space trusses for supporting the reflector facets.<br>
The present invention is scalable due to use of differentially inclined reflector facets.<br>
Further, it is exposed to more insolation (solar energy input) because it can move along two axes, always facing the sun with rays normal to the collector area, thus continuously tracking the sun. It requires only occasional angular adjustment along the second axis.<br>
The present invention has least thermal losses in thermal mode due to internal reflection of the cavity receiver and air stagnation in the blind top in case of downward facing cavity.<br>
The present invention has maximum thermal evacuation in electrical mode using concentrated Solar Photo-Voltaic Cells.<br>
The present invention can be used diurnally (during the day time) as well as nocturnally (during the night time) with thermal or electrical storage of solar energy. Hence it can be used for immediate as well as deferred applications.<br>
It is extremely safe and user-friendly, and hardly requires any adjustment once installed<br>
