				<td>PHENOLIC RESIN, METHOD OF PREPARATION, SIZING<br>
COMPOSITION FOR MINERAL FIBRES, AND RESULTING PRODUCTS<br>
The invention relates to a phenolic resin intended to<br>
be used in the formulation of a sizing composition for<br>
mineral fibres. This resin is obtained by the<br>
condensation of phenol, formaldehyde and an amine in<br>
the presence of a basic catalyst, and it is<br>
characterized by a low content of free formaldehyde and<br>
free phenol.<br>
The invention relates to a method of preparing this<br>
resin, to the sizing composition for mineral fibres<br>
that contains said resin, and to the insulating<br>
products that result therefrom.<br>
Insulation products based on mineral fibres may be<br>
formed from fibres obtained by various processes, for<br>
example using the known technique of internal or<br>
external centrifugal fiberizing. The centrifugation<br>
consists in introducing molten material (in general<br>
glass or rock) into a spinner that has a multitude of<br>
small holes, the material being projected against the<br>
peripheral wall of the device under the action of the<br>
centrifugal force and escaping therefrom in the form of<br>
filaments. On leaving the spinner, the filaments are<br>
attenuated and entrained by a high-velocity high-<br>
temperature gas stream to a receiving member in order<br>
to form a web of fibres.<br>
To assemble the fibres together and provide the web<br>
with cohesion, the fibres, on leaving the spinner, are<br>
sprayed with a sizing composition containing a<br>
thermosetting resin. The web of fibres coated with the<br>
size undergoes a heat treatment (at a temperature above<br>
100°C) so as to polycondense the resin and thus obtain<br>
a thermal and/or acoustic insulation product having<br>
specific properties, especially dimensional stability,<br><br>
tensile strength, thickness recovery after compression,<br>
and uniform colour.<br>
The sizing composition is made up of the resin, which<br>
in general takes the form of an aqueous solution, of<br>
additives, such as urea, silanes, mineral oils, aqueous<br>
ammonia and ammonium sulphate, and of water. The sizing<br>
composition is usually sprayed onto the fibres.<br>
The properties of the sizing composition depend largely<br>
on the characteristics of the resin. From the<br>
standpoint of the application, it is necessary for the<br>
sizing composition to have good sprayability and be<br>
able to be deposited on the surface of the fibres so as<br>
to bond them effectively. The sprayability is directly<br>
related to the capability that the resin possesses of<br>
being able to be diluted in a large amount of water and<br>
to remain stable over time.<br>
The dilution capability is characterized by the<br>
"dilutability", which is defined as the volume of<br>
deionized water that it is possible, at a given<br>
temperature, to add to a unit volume of the aqueous<br>
resin solution before the appearance of permanent<br>
cloudiness. In general, a resin is considered to be<br>
able to be used as a size when its dilutability at 20°C<br>
is 1000% or higher.<br>
The resin must still be stable over a given lapse of<br>
time before being used to form the sizing composition,<br>
which composition is generally prepared at the moment<br>
of use by mixing the resin and the abovementioned<br>
additives. In particular, the resin must be stable for<br>
at least. 8 days at a temperature of around 12 to 18°C.<br>
The resin that can be used in a sprayable sizing<br>
composition must have dilutability at 20°C of 1000% or<br>
higher, preferably 2000% or higher (infinite<br>
dilutability), for at least 8 days.<br><br>
From the regulatory standpoint, it is necessary for the<br>
resin to be considered as non-polluting, that is to say<br>
for it to contain - and generate during the sizing<br>
operation or subsequently - as few as possible<br>
compounds considered to be harmful to human health or<br>
to the environment.<br>
The thermosetting resins most commonly used are<br>
phenolic resins belonging to the family of resoles.<br>
Apart from their good crosslinkability under the<br>
aforementioned thermal conditions, these resins are<br>
very soluble in water, possess good affinity for<br>
mineral fibres, especially glass fibres, and are<br>
relatively inexpensive.<br>
These resins are obtained by the condensation of phenol<br>
and formaldehyde, in the presence of a basic catalyst,<br>
in a formaldehyde/phenol molar ratio generally greater<br>
than 1 so as to promote the reaction between the phenol<br>
and the formaldehyde and to reduce the residual phenol<br>
content in the resin. The residual amount of<br>
formaldehyde and phenol in the resin remains high.<br>
To reduce the amount of residual formaldehyde, it is<br>
known to add a sufficient amount of urea to the resin,<br>
the urea reacting with the free formaldehyde, forming<br>
urea-fornaldehyde condensates (see EP 0 148 050 A1).<br>
The resin obtained contains phenol-formaldehyde and<br>
urea-fornaldehyde condensates, has a free formaldehyde<br>
and free phenol content, expressed with respect to the<br>
total weight of liquid, of 3% and 0.5%, respectively,<br>
or less, and a water dilutability of at least 1000%.<br>
Although the amount of residual phenol is acceptable,<br>
the amount of residual formaldehyde is however too high<br>
to meet the current regulatory constraints.<br><br>
Moreover, it has been found that the resin is not<br>
stable under the conditions that are applied during the<br>
treatment of the sized fibres for the purpose of<br>
crosslinking the resin in order to form the final<br>
insulating products. At the temperature of the<br>
treatment, generally above 100°C in an oven, the urea-<br>
formaldehyde condensates are degraded and they release<br>
formaldehyde, which increases the undesirable gas<br>
emissions into the atmosphere. Formaldehyde may also be<br>
released from the end product during its use as thermal<br>
and/or acoustic insulation.<br>
EP 0 480 778 A1 has proposed to substitute part of the<br>
urea with an amine, which reacts with the free phenol<br>
and the free formaldehyde via the Mannich reaction to<br>
form a condensation product having improved thermal<br>
stability. The free phenol and free formaldehyde<br>
contents of this resin are 0.20% or less and 3% or<br>
less, respectively.<br>
One subject of the present invention is a phenolic<br>
resin which has characteristics sufficient for it to be<br>
used in a sprayable sizing composition, which has a low<br>
capacity for producing undesirable emissions,<br>
especially by having a low free formaldehyde content<br>
and a low free phenol content, and which generates<br>
little formaldehyde during its use.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a method of<br>
producing the resin, which does not involve urea in<br>
order to reduce the free formaldehyde content.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a sizing<br>
composition comprising said resin, its use for sizing<br>
mineral fibres, with the view to forming thermal and/or<br>
acoustic insulation products, and the products thus<br>
obtained.<br><br>
The liquid resin according to the invention, intended<br>
to be used in a sizing composition for mineral fibres,<br>
essentially contains phenol-formaldehyde (P-F) and<br>
phenol-formaldehyde-amine (P-F-A) condensates. The<br>
resin has a free formaldehyde content of 0.3% or less<br>
and a free phenol content of 0.5% or less, these<br>
contents being expressed with respect to the total<br>
weight of liquid.<br>
Preferably, the resin has a free formaldehyde content<br>
of 0.2% or less with respect to the total weight of<br>
liquid, and advantageously of 0.1% or less.<br>
Preferably, the free phenol content of the resin is<br>
0.4% or less.<br>
The resin has a dilutability, measured at 20°C, of at<br>
least 1000%.<br>
The resin is also thermally stable, as it is free of<br>
urea-formaldehyde (U-F) condensates known for their<br>
degradability under the effect of temperature. As for<br>
the P-F-A condensates, these are stable under the<br>
aforementioned conditions - they generate little<br>
formaldehyde for example - in particular during ageing<br>
of the final insulating product.<br>
The amine is chosen from primary amines, which can<br>
react with an aldehyde, for example formaldehyde, and<br>
an organic compound comprising active hydrogen atoms,<br>
for example phenol, to form a Mannich base. This amine<br>
satisfies the following general formula:<br>
R-NH2<br>
in which R represents a saturated or unsaturated,<br>
linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbon group containing<br>
1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Particularly preferably, the hydrocarbon group R<br>
carries at least one hydroxyl radical.<br><br>
The preferred primary amine is monoethanolamine.<br>
According to the invention, the phenol/formaldehyde<br>
condensation reaction is monitored by a reaction that<br>
consists in condensing the free phenol and the free<br>
formaldehyde with a primary amine.<br>
To obtain the resin as defined above, the invention<br>
provides a method that consists in reacting the phenol<br>
with the formaldehyde in the presence of a basic<br>
catalyst, in a formaldehyde/phenol molar ratio of<br>
greater than 1, in cooling the reaction mixture and in<br>
introducing into said reaction mixture, during the<br>
cooling, a primary amine that reacts with the free<br>
formaldehyde and the free phenol via the Mannich<br>
reaction. The invention is characterized in that the<br>
primary amine is introduced right from the start of the<br>
cooling and the reaction mixture is maintained at the<br>
introduction temperature for a time that varies from 10<br>
to 120 minutes.<br>
Preferably, the phenol and the formaldehyde are made to<br>
react in a formaldehyde/phenol molar ratio of between 2<br>
and 4, and advantageously less than or equal to 3, to a<br>
degree of phenol conversion of greater than or equal to<br>
93%, and cooling of the reaction mixture is started.<br>
The cooling takes place at a stage in the condensation<br>
that corresponds to a resin that can still be diluted<br>
with water (dilutability greater than 1000%) .<br>
The expression "degree of phenol conversion" is<br>
understood to mean the percentage amount of phenol that<br>
has participated in reaction condensing with the<br>
formaldehyde relative to the starting phenol content.<br>
According to the invention, the primary amine is added<br>
progressively during the cooling, since the reaction<br>
between phenol and formaldehyde is exothermic, and the<br><br>
temperature at the moment of addition of the amine is<br>
maintained over the time mentioned above, while taking<br>
measures to ensure that the dilutability of the resin<br>
remains at least equal to 1000%.<br>
The primary amine is introduced right from the start of<br>
the cooling, at a temperature that may vary from 50 to<br>
65°C, preferably about 60°C.<br>
The phase during which the temperature is maintained<br>
allows the primary amine to react with almost, all of<br>
the formaldehyde present in the reaction mixture, and<br>
consequently allows the free formaldehyde content in<br>
the final resin to be lowered down to a value of 0.3%<br>
or lower, advantageously of 0.1% or lower. By<br>
maintaining the mixture at this temperature, it is also<br>
possible to lower the free phenol content in the resin<br>
to a value of 0.5% or below, this being particularly<br>
advantageous when the formaldehyde/phenol molar ratio<br>
is less than 3.<br>
The preparation of the resin takes place under a<br>
temperature cycle, which comprises three phases: a<br>
heating phase; a first temperature hold; and a cooling<br>
phase.<br>
In the first phase, the formaldehyde and phenol are<br>
made to react in the presence of a basic catalyst,<br>
while progressively heating to a temperature between 60<br>
and 75°C, preferably about 70°C. The<br>
formaldehyde/phenol molar ratio is greater than 1,<br>
preferably varies from 2 to 4 and is advantageously<br>
equal to 3 or less.<br>
The catalyst may be chosen from catalysts known to<br>
those skilled in the art, for example triethylamine,<br>
lime (CaO) and alkali or alkaline-earth metal<br>
hydroxides, for example sodium hydroxide, potassium<br><br>
hydroxide:, calcium hydroxide or barium hydroxide.<br>
Sodium hydroxide is preferred.<br>
The amount of catalyst varies from 2 to 15%, preferably<br>
5 to 9% and advantageously 6 to 8% by weight relative<br>
to the initial weight of phenol.<br>
In the second phase, the temperature of the reaction<br>
mixture, which is reached after heating the reaction<br>
mixture (end of the first phase), is maintained until<br>
the degree of phenol conversion is at least 93%.<br>
The third phase is a cooling phase during which the<br>
primary amine is introduced into the reaction mixture<br>
so as to start the reaction with the residual<br>
formaldehyde and the residual phenol, and thus to form<br>
the P-F-A condensates.<br>
The addition of the primary amine takes place<br>
progressively owing to the exothermic character of the<br>
reaction, as indicated above, and may for example be<br>
carried out at a rate of from 1 to 5%, preferably 2 to<br>
4%, by weight of the total amount of amine per minute.<br>
The amount of primary amine, in particular<br>
monoethanolamine, is added in an amount of 0.2 to<br>
0.7 mol, preferably 0.25 to 0.5 mol, of amine per mole<br>
of starting phenol.<br>
The duration of the primary amine addition may vary<br>
from 10 to 120 minutes, preferably 20 to 100 minutes<br>
and advantageously 25 to 50 minutes.<br>
Preferably, the addition of the primary amine is<br>
carried out at a temperature between 50 and 65°C and<br>
advantageously about 60°C.<br>
After the primary amine has been added, there is a<br>
temperature hold by keeping the temperature at the end<br><br>
of introduction for 10 to 120 minutes, preferably at<br>
least 15 minutes, so as to continue the condensation<br>
reaction between the formaldehyde, the phenol and the<br>
primary amine until a more advanced stage and thus<br>
reduce the amount of free formaldehyde and free phenol,<br>
the dilutability of the resin, measured at 20°C, having<br>
to be maintained at least at 1000%.<br>
After the P-F-A condensates have been formed, the<br>
reaction mixture is cooled so that its temperature<br>
reaches about 20 to 25°C and is neutralized so as to<br>
stop the condensation reactions.<br>
In general, the reaction mixture is neutralized by<br>
adding an acid in sufficient amount for the pH of the<br>
mixture to be less than 8.5, preferably less than 7.0<br>
and advantageously between 4.0 and 6.0. The acid may be<br>
chosen from sulphuric, sulphamic, phosphoric and boric<br>
acids. Sulphuric acid and sulphamic acid are preferred.<br>
The invention also relates to a sizing composition that<br>
can be applied to mineral fibres, especially glass or<br>
rock fibres, and to the insulating products obtained<br>
from these sized fibres.<br>
The sizing composition comprises the phenolic resin<br>
according to the present invention and sizing<br>
additives.<br>
Given that, as indicated above, the resin according to<br>
the invention has a very low free formaldehyde content<br>
of less than 0.3%, it is unnecessary to add urea to the<br>
sizing composition, except if it is desired to control<br>
the gel time of the size in order to prevent any<br>
pregelling problems.<br>
In general, the sizing composition according to the<br>
invention comprises the following additives, per 100<br><br>
parts of solid resin and urea material, where<br>
appropriate:<br>
- 0 to 5 parts, generally less than 3 parts, of<br>
ammonium sulphate;<br>
- 0 to 2 parts of a silane, in particular an<br>
aminosileme;<br>
- 0 to 20 parts, generally 6 to 15 parts, of oil;<br>
and<br>
- 0 to 20 parts, generally less than 12 parts, of<br>
aqueous ammonia (20 wt% solution).<br>
The role of the additives is known and will be briefly<br>
recalled: the ammonium sulphate serves as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst (in the hot oven) after the<br>
sizing composition has been sprayed onto the fibres;<br>
the silane is a coupling agent for coupling between the<br>
fibres and the resin and also acts as an anti-ageing<br>
agent; the oils are hydrophobic anti-dust agents;<br>
aqueous ammonia acts, when cold, as a polycondensation<br>
retarder; and urea, as already mentioned, acts on the<br>
pregelling of the size.<br>
The examples that follow allow the invention to be<br>
illustrated without however limiting it.<br>
In the examples, the following analytical methods are<br>
used:<br>
-	the amount of free phenol is measured by gas<br>
chromatography using a filled column (stationary phase:<br>
Carbowax 20 M) and a flame ionization detector (FID);<br>
and<br>
-	the amount of free formaldehyde is measured by<br>
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and post-<br>
column reaction under the conditions of the<br>
ASTM D 5910-96 standard modified so that the mobile<br>
phase is water buffered to pH 6.8, the oven temperature<br>
is equal to 90°C and the detection is carried out at<br>
420 nm.<br><br>
