				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising 3-<br>
phenyluracils I, N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-<br>
methoxybenzamide II and optionally at least one further herbicide III.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable in principle to increase the specificity and the<br>
reliability of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop<br>
protection product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be<br>
tolerated by the useful plants in question. It is known that in some cases better crop<br>
plant compatibility can be achieved by joint application of specifically acting herbicides<br>
with organic active compounds, which act as antidotes or antagonists. Owing to the<br>
fact that they can reduce or even prevent damage to the crop plants, they are also re-<br>
ferred to as safeners.<br>
3-phenyluracils I and compositions comprising 3-phenyluracils I are known as highly<br>
effective herbicides (e.g. WO 01/83459, WO 03/24221, WO 04/80183). However, their<br>
compatibility with dicotyledonous crop plants such as cotton, oilseed rape, flax, lentil,<br>
sugar beet, tobacco, sunflowers and soybeans and some graminaceous plants such as<br>
oat, barley, millet, corn, rice, wheat and sugar cane is not always satisfactory, i. e. in<br>
addition-to the harmful plants, the crop plants are also damaged to an extent which is<br>
not acceptable. It is possible to spare the useful plants by lowering the application<br>
rates; however the extent of the control of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
Therefore it is an object of the present invention to improve the crop-plant compatibility<br>
of 3-phenyluracils I, optionally in the presence of further herbicides III.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that compositions comprising at least one 3-<br>
phenyluracil I or its agriculturally acceptable salts, N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]-<br>
phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II or its agriculturally acceptable salts; and op-<br>
tionally at least one further herbicide III, improve the crop-plant compatibility of 3-<br>
phenyluracils I.<br>
N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II (CAS no.<br>
221667-31-8)<br><br>
is a safener, which is disclosed, for example, in WO 99/16744 and WO 05/00797.<br><br>
The herbicides III of groups III.1) to III.15) are known herbicides, see the quoted litera-<br>
ture references and, for example, The Compendium of Pesticide Common Names<br>
(http://www.hcIrss.demon.co.uk/index.html); Farm Chemicals Handbook 2000, Vol. 86,<br>

group, their agriculturally acceptable derivatives.<br>
The invention relates in particular to compositions in the form of safened herbicidally<br>
active crop protection compositions comprising a herbicidally effective amount of at<br>
least one composition of 3-phenyluracil I with N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]-<br>

which comprises applying a herbicidal composition according to the present invention<br>
before, during and/or after the emergence of the undesirable plants, the components I,<br>
II and optionally III being applied simultaneously or in succession.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation in<br>
crops, in particular in crops of oat, barley, millet, corn, rice, wheat, sugar cane, cotton,<br>
oilseed rape, flax, lentil, sugar beet, tobacco, sunflowers and soybeans or in perennial<br>
crops.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation in<br>
crops which, by genetic engineering or by breeding, are resistant to one or more herbi-<br>

are present as enantiomers or diastereomers, it is possible to use both the pure enan-<br>
tiomers and diastereomers and their compositions in the compositions according to the<br>
invention.<br>

ized, they can also be used in the form of their agriculturally acceptable salts. Also, N-<br>
[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide can be used in<br>
the form of its agriculturally acceptable salts. In general, the salts of those cations or<br>
anions are suitable whose cations or anions have no adverse effect on the action of the<br>
active compounds ("agricultural acceptable").<br>

[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II and herbicide III<br>
for example 1:1:1, 2:1:1, 1:2:1, 1:5:1 or 1:5:2.<br>
In the ready-to-use preparations, i.e. in the compositions according to the invention in<br>
the form of crop protection products, the components I and II and optionally III, in sus-<br>
pended, emulsified or dissolved form, can be present formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The use forms depend entirely on the intended use.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied, for example, in the form of<br>
directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated<br>
aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes,<br>
dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting,<br>
broadcasting or watering. The use forms depend on the intended use; in any case, they<br>
should ensure the finest possible distribution of the active compounds.<br>
Depending on the form in which the ready-to-use preparations are present in the com-<br>
positions according to the invention, they comprise one or more liquid or solid carriers,<br>
if appropriate surfactants and if appropriate further auxiliaries which are customary for<br>
formulating crop protection products. The person skilled in the art is sufficiently familiar<br>
with the recipes for such formulations.<br>
The ready-to-use preparations comprise the components I and II and optionally III and<br>
auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products, which auxilia-<br>
ries may also comprise a liquid carrier.<br>
Suitable inert additives with carrier function are essentially: mineral oil fractions of me-<br>
dium to high boiling point, such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and<br>
oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. par-<br>
affins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated<br>
benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol<br>
and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, e.g.<br>
amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes,<br>
wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emul-<br>
sions, pastes or oil dispersions, the active compounds I, II or III, as such or dissolved in<br>
an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier,<br><br>
dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates consisting<br>
of active substance, wetting agent,- tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if desired,<br>
solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium<br>
salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphtha-<br>
lenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, of alkyl sulfates,<br>
lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and<br>
octadecanols and of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene<br>
and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphtha-<br>
lenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenol ether,<br>

polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene<br>
oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether or polyoxypro-<br>
pylene alkyl ether, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite<br>

Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitant<br>
grinding of the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules,<br>
can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are<br>
mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk,<br>
bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate,<br>
magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate,<br>
ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin<br>
such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders,<br>
or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds in the ready-to-use preparations can be<br>
varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise from 0.001 to 98% by<br>
weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of active ingredients. The active ingredients<br>
are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to<br>
NMR spectrum).<br>
The compounds according to the invention can, for example, be formulated as follows:<br>
I 20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are dissolved<br>
in a composition composed of 80 parts by weight of alkylated benzene, 10 parts<br>
by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of oleic acid N-<br>
monoethanolamide, 5 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 5<br>
parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil.<br><br>
. Pouring the solution into TOO 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it<br>
therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the ac-<br>
tive ingredient.<br>
II	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are dissolved<br>
in a composition composed of 40 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 30 parts by<br>
weight of isobutanol, 20 parts by weight of the adduct of 7 mol of ethylene oxide<br>
to 1 mol of isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of eth-<br>
ylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by<br>
weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion<br>
which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
III	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are dissolved<br>
in a composition composed of 25 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 65 parts by<br>
weight of a mineral oil fraction of boiling point 210 to 280°C and 10 parts by<br>
weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the<br>
solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein<br>
gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active in-<br>
gredient.<br>
IV	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed<br>
thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonate, 17<br>
parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liq-<br>
uor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the composition is ground<br>
in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the composition in 20 000 parts by weight of<br>
water gives a spray composition which comprises 0.1% by weight of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
V	3 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed with<br>
97 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3%<br>
by weight of the active ingredient.<br>
VI	20 parts by weight of the active compound composition in question are mixed<br>
intimately with 2 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 8 parts by<br>
weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a<br>
phenol-urea-formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraffinic min-<br>
eral oil. This gives a stable oily dispersion.<br>
VII	1 part by weight of the active compound composition in question is dissolved in a<br>
composition composed of 70 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 20 parts by<br>
weight of ethoxylated isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of ethoxylated castor<br>
oil. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br><br>
VIII 1 part by weight of the active compound composition in question.is dissolved in a<br>
composition composed of 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 20 parts by<br>
weight of Wettol® EM 31 (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil).<br>
This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The components I and II and optionally III can be formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The components I and II and optionally III can be applied jointly or separately, simulta-<br>
neously or successively, before, during or after emergence of the plants.<br>
If the active compounds I and II and optionally III are less well tolerated by certain crop<br>
plants, it is possible to use application methods in which the herbicidal compositions<br>
are sprayed with the aid of sprayers in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop<br>
plants are as far as possible unaffected, whereas the active compounds reach the<br>
leaves of the undesirable plants growing underneath or the uncovered soil surface<br>
(post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The required application rate of the composition of the pure active compounds, i.e. of I<br>
and II and optionally III without formulation auxiliary, depends on the density of the un-<br>
desired vegetation, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions<br>
of the location where the composition is used and on the application method. In gen-<br>
eral, the application rate of I and II and optionally III is from 0.001 to 3 kg/ha, preferably<br>
from 0.005 to 2 kg/ha and in particular from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha of active substance.<br>
The required application rates of the 3-phenyluracils I and N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)-<br>
carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II are generally in the range from 0.1<br>
g/ha to 1 kg/ha and preferably in the range from 1 g/ha to 500 g/ha or from 5 g/ha to<br>
500 g/ha of active substance.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by spraying, in particular foliar spray-<br>
ing. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for exam-<br>
ple, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 50 to 1000 l/ha (for example<br>
from 300 to 400 l/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by the low-volume and<br>
the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in the form of micro-<br>
granules.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are suitable for controlling com-<br>
mon harmful plants in useful plants, in particular in crops such as oat, barley, millet,<br>
com, rice, wheat, sugar cane, cotton, oilseed rape, flax, lentil, sugar beet, tobacco,<br>
sunflowers and soybeans or in perennial crops.<br><br>
Moreover, it may be useful to apply the compositions according to the invention jointly<br>
as a composition with other crop protection products, for example,with .pestipid.es or'.<br>
agents for controlling phytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibil-<br>
ity with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace ele-<br>
ment deficiencies. Non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also be used in crop plants which, by<br>
genetic engineering or by breeding, are resistant to one or more herbicides and/ or<br>
fungicides and/or or to attack by insects.<br>
Suitable are for example crop plants preferably corn, wheat, barley, sunflower, rice,<br>
canola, soybeans which are resistant to herbicidal EPSP synthase inhibitors, such as,<br>
for example, glyphosate, to herbicidal glutamine synthase inhibitors, such as, for ex-<br>
ample, glufosinate, to herbicidal protoporphyrinogen-IX oxidase inhibitors, such as, for<br>
example, butafenacil, or to herbicidal ALS inhibitors, such as, for example, imazameth-<br>
abenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, or crop plants which,<br>
owing to introduction of the gene for Bt toxin by genetic modification, are resistant to<br>
attack by certain insects.<br>
Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which, in addition to the 3-<br>
phenyluracil I and optionally a herbicide III, comprise the safener N-[[4-<br>
[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II, are better toler-<br>
ated by useful plants than the respective compositions comprising a 3-phenyluracil I<br>
and optionally a herbicide III without safener II.<br>
The 3-phenyluracils of formula I can be prepared by the preparation processes dis-<br>
closed in WO 01/83459. With respect to the preparation of individual compounds, ref-<br>
erence is made to the examples of WO 01/83459. Compounds, which are not explicitly<br>
disclosed in this document, can be prepared in an analogous manner.<br>
N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide II can be pre-<br>
pared by the preparation processes disclosed by the earlier applications WO 99/16744<br>
and WO 05/00797.<br>
Use Examples<br>
The effect of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention of components I<br>
and II and, if appropriate, III on the growth of undesirable plants compared to the herbi-<br>
cidally active compounds alone can be demonstrated by the following greenhouse ex-<br>
periments.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, directly after sowing the active compounds, which<br>
had been suspended or emulsified in water, were applied by means of finely distributed<br><br>
nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination anC1-Tjrowth and<br>
subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until plant had rooted. This cover ...<br>
caused uniform germination of the tests plants, unless this was adversely affected by<br>
active compounds.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to<br>
20 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated. Here, the herbicidal com-<br>
positions were suspended or emulsified in water as distribution medium and sprayed<br>
using finely distributing nozzles.<br>
The respective component I was formulated as a 12% by weight strength emulsion<br>
concentrate, and component II as a 10% by weight suspension concentrate. Optionally<br>
components III can be used in their appropriate available formulation types.<br>
The components I, II and optionally III were introduced to the spray liquid with the<br>
amount of solvent system used for applying the active compound.<br>
The test period extended over 21 days. During this time, the plants were tended, and<br>
their response to the treatments with active compound was evaluated.<br>
The evaluation for the damage caused by the chemical compositions was carried out<br>
using a scale from 0 to 100%, compared to the untreated control plants. Here, 0 means<br>
no damage and 100 means complete destruction of the plants.<br>
A safener action is present if the damage to the crop plant caused by a mixture accorC1-<br>
ing to the present invention which contains N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]-<br>
sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide is less than the damage caused when the phenyluracil I<br>
optionally in mixture with a herbicide III according to the present invention is used with-<br>
out N-[[4-[(cyclopropylamino)carbonyl]phenyl]sulfonyl]-2-methoxybenzamide.<br><br><br>

against POLCO, CHEAL, ABUTH and AMARE and safener action with regard to<br>
TRZAS, HORVW and ZEAMX<br><br>
