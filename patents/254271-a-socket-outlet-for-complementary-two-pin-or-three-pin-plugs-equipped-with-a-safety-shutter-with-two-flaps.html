				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates generally to socket outlets including a support member for contact members which come into contact with the pins of a complementary plug, and a front cover which receives the plug and in which there are three first openings to provide each pin of a complementary three-pin plug with access to a contact member and two other openings adapted to provide each pin of a complementary two-pin plug with access to a contact member.<br>
The present invention is more particularly directed to the situation in which a safety closure member, usually called a "shutter", is placed over the access to the contact members, to control access thereto.<br>
In one such prior art arrangement, the safety shutter comprises a single flap disposed between the front cover and the support member and mobile parallel to said cover, and return spring means urge it at all times toward a closed position in which it bars access to the contact members.<br>
A first inclined plane on the shutter is adapted to cooperate with the earth pin of a complementary three-pin plug to actuate the shutter in a first direction to enable said pins to access contact members opposite the three openings into which the pins are inserted. Two other inclined planes are adapted to cooperate with a pin of a complementary two-pin plug to actuate the shutter in a direction opposite to the first direction, to enable said two pins to access contact members facing the two openings into which the two pins are inserted.<br>
Other prior art socket outlets cooperate with two types of three-pin plug which differ in terms of the diameters of the pins and the distances between them. The safety shutter used in these socket outlets includes two flaps which can move in translation on each other and relative to each other. Each flap cooperates with one<br>
kind of three-pin plug and spring means between the flaps urge them at all times toward their closed position.<br>
In practice, this shutter suffers from reliability problems caused by the flaps becoming jammed together.<br>
The invention aims generally to improve the structural and functional characteristics of a shutter for a socket outlet adapted to receive a complementary three-pin plug or a complementary two-pin plug. A particular object of the invention is to improve the safety of this kind of socket outlet while at the same time guaranteeing a high degree of reliability.<br>
To be more precise, the invention provides a socket outlet including a support member for supporting contact members adapted to come into contact with the pins of a complementary plug, a front cover adapted to receive the plug and including three first openings adapted to provide each pin of a complementary three-pin plug with access to a contact member and two other openings adapted to provide each pin of a complementary two-pin plug with access to a contact member, and, placed over the access to said contact members, a safety shutter, Claimsin that the safety shutter includes retractable first and second flaps each of which, in the absence of a plug, occupies a rest position in which the first flap bars access to contact members opposite the three first openings and the second flap bars access to contact members opposite the two other openings, and, when a plug is inserted into the socket outlet, a retracted position in which the flap allows said access, the first flap being further adapted to be actuated by an earth pin of the complementary three-pin plug, return spring means urge said flaps at all times toward their rest position, the flaps each include guide and retaining means whereby the second flap is retained on the first flap and the flaps are mounted so as to be mobile in translation on<br>
each other and in opposite directions to each other along an axis parallel to a plane common to all the openings in the cover, to allow each flap to move between its rest position to its retracted position, abutments immobilise one of the flaps against movement in translation when the other flap is urged toward its retracted position by a plug, and said guide means further serve to mount the second flap on the first flap so that it can pivot about said axis, enabling said second flap to be immobilised against movement in translation if it is subjected to a pivoting force in its rest position.<br>
The above kind of safety shutter is safer. This is because it is necessary, on the one hand, to insert a plug with an earth pin into the socket outlet to actuate the first flap and, on the other hand, to insert the two pins of a two-pin plug simultaneously into the socket outlet to actuate the second flap. Inserting a single pin or a similar object (paperclip, etc.) into the socket outlet tilts the second flap and thereby immobilises it against movement in translation.<br>
Each of the two flaps therefore provides an independent safety system. Moreover, the guide and retaining means guide one flap relative to the other with no risk of unwanted jamming.<br>
Furthermore, the arrangement in accordance with the invention advantageously lends itself to an improvement whereby the return spring means comprise a single compression spring, each of the flaps incorporating a seat for one end of the spring, so that the flaps and the spring form a unitary subassembly.<br>
This kind of unitary subassembly can be manipulated on its own, which has the advantage of simplifying the assembly of the socket outlet.<br>
For convenience of fabrication and assembly, the first flap includes, in a generally T-shaped<br>
configuration, a central leg having a bevelled head adapted to cooperate with an earth pin of a complementary three-pin plug to move the first flap in translation in response to a thrust exerted by the earth pin on the head when it is inserted into one of the first three openings, and two lateral flanges designed to bar access to contact members opposite the remaining two openings; and the second flap includes two flanges disposed on respective opposite sides of the guide and retaining means of said flap and designed to bar access to contact members opposite the other two openings and each of said flanges has an inclined plane for actuating the second flap in response to a thrust exerted by simultaneously inserting the pins of a complementary two-pin plug into the socket outlet.<br>
For the same reasons, the guide and retaining means of the second flap preferably include a journal forming a seat for the compression spring, a central plate connecting the flanges of said flap, and a bridge connecting the central plate to the journal and substantially perpendicular to the central plate; and the guide and retaining means of the first flap preferably include a substantially cylindrical longitudinal passage in the central leg accommodating the journal of the second flap and the compression spring and said passage is interrupted by a longitudinal guide slot in which the bridge of the second flap slides.<br>
To enable the second flap to pivot on the first flap, the guide and retaining means preferably include a notch in each of the flanks of the passage on either side of the longitudinal slot and adapted to allow the second flap to pivot.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the flanges of the first flap are separated from the inside face of the front cover by locating ribs projecting substantially<br>
perpendicularly from the inside face so that the safety shutter is at a distance from said inside face adapted to allow the second flap to pivot correctly.<br>
The first and second flaps are preferably moulded from plastics material and the bottom of the longitudinal passage preferably includes a window adapted to facilitate removal of the first flap from a mould. It is therefore possible to reduce the draughts, to the benefit of good interworking of the two flaps.<br>
The window is advantageously further adapted to enable extraction of the compression spring from the longitudinal passage in order to demount the safety shutter. The first flap can then be used in a socket outlet adapted to receive only a complementary three-pin plug.<br>
The arrangement in accordance with the invention also lends itself to another improvement whereby the abutments are formed by ribs projecting substantially perpendicularly from the inside face of the front cover and the first and second flaps of the safety shutter abut against opposite sides of the ribs in the rest position.<br>
The front cover can also include locating ribs projecting from the inside face of the cover and contributing to guiding movement in translation of the first flap and/or the second flap.<br>
The invention also provides a socket outlet front cover as described hereinabove equipped with a safety shutter as described hereinabove.<br>
The invention will be better understood after reading the following detailed description, which is given by way of example and with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which:<br>

In the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6, the socket outlet according to the invention includes, in a manner that is known to the person skilled in the art, a support member 11 for contact members and a front cover 12 adapted to be mounted on and to cover the support member 11.<br>
In a manner that is also known to the person skilled in the art, the support member 11 includes two contact members 13, 14 which can be made live and come into contact with the live and neutral pins of a complementary two-pin or three-pin plug. A third contact member 15 comes into contact with the earth pin of the complementary three-pin plug.<br>
The contact members are not in themselves relevant to the present invention and are not described in detail here. Likewise the complementary plugs, which are not shown in the drawings.<br>
As shown in the figure 3 plan view, the front cover 12 includes three first openings 16-18 that provide each pin of the complementary three-pin plug with access to one of the contact members 13-15 on the support member 11<br>
and two other openings 19, 20 which provide each pin of a complementary two-pin plug with access to one of the contact members 13, 14 which can be made live.<br>
In this regard, note that the socket outlet shown in the figures is designed to receive circular section pins of a complementary plug. Socket outlets according to the invention are not limited to this type of pin, however, and can be designed to receive plugs whose pins have any other suitable shape, or even a combination of pins with different shapes.<br>
In a manner that is also known to the person skilled in the art, the socket outlet according to the invention includes a safety shutter 21 placed over the access to the contact members 13-15.<br>
In practice, in the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6, the safety shutter 21 is under the cover 12 and parallel to the inside face 22 of the front wall of the cover 12.<br>
As shown in figures 4 and 5 in particular, the safety shutter 21 includes, in accordance with the invention, first and second retractable flaps 23, 24 each of which, in the absence of a plug, occupies a rest position, in which the first flap 23 bars access to the contact members 13-15 opposite the first three openings 16-18 and the second flap 24 bars access to the contact members 13, 14 opposite the other two openings 19, 20, and, when a plug is inserted into the socket outlet, a retracted position in which the flap 23 or 24 allows such access.<br>
To be more precise, in the embodiment shown, the first flap 23 has a generally T-shaped configuration and includes a central leg 25 with a bevelled head 26 which cooperates with the earth pin of a complementary three-pin plug to move the first flap 23 in translation in response to a thrust exerted on the head 26 by the earth<br>
pin when it is inserted into the opening 18 and two lateral flanges 27 which bar access to the contact members 13, 14 opposite the openings 16, 17 in the cover 12.<br>
The second flap 24 has two flanges 28 which bar access to the contact members 13, 14, which are also opposite the openings 19, 20 in the cover 12, and an inclined plane 29 on each flange actuates the second flap 24 in response to a thrust exerted by simultaneously inserting the live and neutral pins of a complementary two-pin plug into the socket outlet.<br>
Note also that the flanges 27 of the first flap 23 lie in a substantially horizontal plane and, just like the flanges 28 of the second flap 24, each has a lateral protuberance 30, 31 contributing to correctly locating the shutter 21 in the cover 12.<br>
Each of the flaps 23, 24 has its own guide and retaining means whereby the second flap 24 is retained to the first flap 23 and the flaps 23, 24 can move in translation on each other and in opposite directions to each other, along an axis 32 parallel to the inside face 22, which forms a plane common to all the openings 16-20 in the cover 12, to allow each flap 23, 24 to move between its rest position and its retracted position. The guide and retaining means also serve to mount the second flap 24 on the first flap 23 so that it can pivot about the axis 32 (see figures 2 and 6), which immobilises the second flap 24 against movement in translation if a pivoting force is applied to it when it is in its rest position.<br>
To be more precise, the guide and retaining means of the second flap 24 include a journal 33, a central plate 34 connecting the flanges 28 of the flap 24, and a bridge 35 connecting the central plate 34 to the journal 33 and extending substantially perpendicularly to the<br>
central plate 34, which is in a substantially horizontal plane.<br>
The guide and retaining means of the first flap 23 include a substantially cylindrical longitudinal passage 36 in the central leg 25.<br>
The longitudinal passage 36 accommodates the journal 33 of the second flap 24 and a compression spring 37.<br>
In practice, in the embodiment shown, a seat 38 is provided for the compression spring at the front end of the journal 33 and has a globally conical stud 39 projecting from it for centring the spring 37.<br>
The other end of the compression spring 37 abuts against the bevelled head 26 which forms a seat 40 (see figure 5) for the spring 37 at the front end of the longitudinal passage 36.<br>
The compression spring 37 thus constitutes the return spring means referred to above that urge the flaps 23, 24 at all times toward their rest position. As shown in figures 5 and 6, the flaps 23, 24 and the spring 37 together form a unitary subassembly.<br>
The longitudinal passage 36 is interrupted by a longitudinal guide slot 41 in which the bridge 35 of the second flap 24 slides.<br>
The longitudinal slot 41 extends from the bevelled head 26 to the rear end of the first flap 23.<br>
The guide and retaining means also include a notch 42, which is rectangular in this example, in each flank 43 of the longitudinal passage 36 on either side of the slot 41. These notches 42, which are situated in front of the flanges 27, allow the second flap 24 to pivot on the first flap 23.<br>
Accordingly, if a pivoting force is applied to the second flap 24 by applying a thrust to only one of the flanges 28, the central plate 34 of the flap 24 tilts in<br>
one of the notches 42 (see figure 6) and abuts against a vertical edge 44 of the notch 42. This immobilises the second flap 24 against movement in translation if it is subjected to a pivoting force when in its rest position.<br>
On the other hand, the second flap 24 slides freely in the longitudinal passage 36 and the slot 41 if a thrust is applied simultaneously to both inclined planes 29 of the flanges 28.<br>
In this regard, note that the longitudinal slot 41 is wider in the area of the notches 42 than in the area near the bevelled head 26 or that flanked by the flanges 27. The transition area at the same end as the flanges 27 is formed by a shoulder 45 at the front end of each of the flanges 27 and the transition area at the same end as the bevelled head 26 is formed by convergent surfaces 46 contributing to guiding movement of the second flap 24 in translation.<br>
When the safety shutter 21 is not mounted on the cover 12, the flanges 29 of the second flap 24, in the rest position, abut against the flanges 27 and the bridge 35 abuts against the shoulders 45. The central plate 34 then partly covers the tops of the flanges 27.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6, the central plate 34 slides on the top faces 47 of the flanks 43 when the bridge 35 slides in the longitudinal guide slot 41, at the front end of the central leg 25.<br>
More generally, the guide and retaining means described above guide movement of the flaps 23, 24 in translation relative to each other and provide a pivoting mounting of the second flap 24 on the first flap 23, while at the same time retaining the second flap 24 on the first flap 23.<br>
The safety shutter 21 can nevertheless be demounted thanks to a window 48 formed in the bottom 49 of the longitudinal passage 36, in the vicinity of the bevelled<br>
head 26 and at the opposite end of the central leg 25 to the longitudinal slot 41 and the flanges 27.<br>
The window 48 advantageously has a two-fold function.<br>
First of all, it facilitates removing from its mould the first flap 23, which is moulded from plastics material, like the second flap 24.<br>
It is therefore possible to reduce the draughts, which is to the benefit of good interworking of the two flaps 23, 24.<br>
It is further adapted to allow extraction of the compression spring 37 from the longitudinal passage 36 in order to demount the safety shutter 21. It can be extracted by means of a screwdriver, for example. The second flap 24 can then be separated from the first flap 23 by tilting the second flap 24 after moving its journal 33 into the widest area of the longitudinal slot 41, namely the area incorporating the notches 42.<br>
The first flap 23 can then serve as a safety shutter, independently of the second flap 24, in a socket outlet which receives only complementary three-pin plugs. This variant is described in more detail hereinafter with reference to figure 7.<br>
As shown in figure 2, the front cover 12 is here provided with two ribs 50 forming abutments adapted to immobilise one of the flaps 23, 24 against movement in translation when the other is urged toward its retracted position by the pins of a complementary plug inserted into the socket outlet. The ribs 50 project substantially perpendicularly from the inside face 22 of the front cover 12. They espouse a portion of the contour of the flanges 27, 28, which is to the benefit of correct location of the latter.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 2, the flanges 27, 28 mainly abut against opposite walls of the<br>
intermediate parts 51 of each of the ribs 50 that extend in a direction perpendicular to the axis 32 when the safety shutter 21 is mounted on the front cover 12.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6, and more particularly in figure 2, the front cover 12 also includes locating ribs 52 and 53 which project from its inside face 22 and contribute to guiding movement in translation of the first and second flaps 23, 24.<br>
The rib 52 is parallel to the intermediate parts 51 of the ribs 50 and contributes to guiding movement in translation of the second flap 24, and each of the ribs 53 surrounds one of the openings 16, 17 and includes a tongue 54 extending toward the adjoining rim 55 of the cover 12 and perpendicularly to the latter.<br>
In this embodiment, the ribs 53 also separate the flanges 27 of the first flap 23 from the inside face 22 of the front cover 12 so that the safety shutter 21 is at a distance from the inside face 22 such that the second flap 24 can pivot correctly.<br>
Thanks to these features, inserting an earth pin of a complementary three-pin plug into the opening 18 moves the first flap 23 of the safety shutter 21 in translation in the direction of the arrows A in figure 2, from its rest position, which is shown in this figure, to its retracted position, in which it allows the pins of the complementary plug access to the contact members 13 - 15 which come into contact with them. During this movement, the second flap 24 is immobilised against movement in translation by the intermediate part 51 of the ribs 50.<br>
During this movement in translation, the first flap 23 also slides on the support member 11.<br>
Withdrawing the complementary three-pin plug causes the compression spring 37 to return the first flap 23 to its rest position.<br>
The second flap 24 can be moved in translation in<br>
the direction of the arrows B shown in figure 2 in response to a thrust exerted by simultaneously inserting the pins of a complementary two-pin plug into the socket outlet. During this movement, the first flap is also immobilised against movement in translation by the intermediate parts 51 of the ribs 50.<br>
In its retracted position, the second flap 24 allows the two pins of the complementary plug access to the contact members 13, 14. On withdrawing the plug, the compression spring 37 returns the second flap 24 to its rest position, shown in figure 2.<br>
On the other hand, if a pivoting force is applied to the second flap 24 in response to a thrust exerted on only one of the flanges 28, for example by inserting a paperclip with the intention of immobilising the second flap 24 in the retracted position, the latter is immobilised against movement in translation by the first flap 23, as shown in figure 6.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 7, the safety shutter 21 includes only the first flap 23, because the front cover 120 is adapted to be mounted on a socket outlet intended to receive only pins of complementary three-pin plugs. It therefore includes only three openings, which are identical to the openings 16 - 18. Only one of these openings can be seen in figure 7, namely an opening 180 which receives the earth pin of the complementary three-pin plug, which actuates the flap 23 in a similar manner to that described with reference to the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6.<br>
The only difference between these two embodiments is that a stud 190 projecting from the inside face of the cover 120 forms a seat for one end of the compression spring 37, alleviating the absence of the second flap 24.<br>
This reduces fabrication costs thanks to the possibility of using the first flap with two different<br>
ypes of socket outlet.<br>
Of course, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described and shown, and encompasses any variant thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A socket outlet including a support member (11) for supporting contact members (13-15) adapted to come into contact with the pins of a complementary plug, a front cover (12) adapted to receive the plug and including three first openings (16-18) adapted to provide each pin of a complementary three-pin plug with access to a contact member and two other openings (19, 20) adapted to provide each pin of a complementary two-pin plug with access to a contact member, and, placed over the access to said contact members, a safety shutter (21), characterized in that the safety shutter (21) includes retractable first and second flaps (23, 24) each of which, in the absence of a plug, occupies a rest position in which the first flap (23) bars access to contact members opposite the three first openings (16-18) and the second flap (24) bars access to contact members opposite the two other openings (19, 20), and, when a plug is inserted into the socket outlet, a retracted position in which the flap allows said access, the first flap (23) being further adapted to be actuated by an earth pin of the complementary three-pin plug, return - spring means (37) urge said flaps (23, 24) at all times toward their rest position, the flaps each include guide and retaining means (33-36, 41, 42) whereby the second flap (24) is retained on the first flap (23) and the flaps (23, 24) are mounted so as to be mobile in translation on each other and in opposite directions to each other along an axis (32) parallel to a plane common to all the openings (16-20) in the cover (12), to allow each flap (23, 24) to move between its rest position to its retracted position, abutments (50) immobilize one of the flaps (23, 24) against movement in translation when the other flap is urged toward its retracted position by a plug, and said guide means (33-36, 41, 42) further serve to mount the second flap (24) on the first flap (23) so that it can pivot about said axis (32), enabling said second flap (24) to be immobilized against movement in translation if it is subjected to a pivoting force in its rest position.<br><br>
2.	A socket outlet as claimed in claim 1, wherein the return spring means (37) comprises a single compression spring (37) and each of the flaps (23, 24) includes a seat (38, 40) for one end of said spring (37) so that said flaps (23, 24) and said spring (37) form a unitary subassembly.<br>
3.	A socket outlet as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the first flap (23) includes, in a generally T-shaped configuration, a central leg (25) having a bevelled head (26) adapted to cooperate with an earth pin of a complementary three-pin plug to move the first flap (23) in translation in response to a thrust exerted by the earth pin on the head (26) when it is inserted into one of the first three openings, and two lateral flanges (27) designed to bar access to contact members opposite the remaining two openings.<br>
4.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the second flap (24) includes two flanges (28) disposed on respective opposite sides of the guide and retaining means of said flap and designed to bar access to contact members opposite the other two openings (19, 20) and each of said flanges (28) has an inclined plane (29) for actuating the second flap (24) in response to a thrust exerted by simultaneously inserting the pins of a complementary two-pin plug into the socket outlet.<br>
5.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 2 to 4, wherein the guide and retaining means of the second flap (24) includes a journal (33) forming a seat (38) for the compression spring (37), a central plate (34) connecting the flanges (28) of said flap (24), and a bridge (35) connecting the central plate (34) to the journal (33) and substantially perpendicular to the central plate (34).<br><br>
6.	A socket outlet as claimed in claim 5, wherein the guide and retaining means of the first flap (23) include a substantially cylindrical longitudinal passage (36) in the central leg (25) accommodating the journal (33) of the second flap and the compression spring (37) and said passage (36) is interrupted by a longitudinal guide slot (41) in which the bridge (35) of the second flap (24) slides.<br>
7.	A socket outlet as claimed in claim 6, wherein the guide and retaining means include a notch (42) in each of the flanks (43) of the passage (36) on either side of the longitudinal slot (41) and adapted to allow the second flap (24) to pivot.<br>
8.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 3 to 7, wherein the flanges (27) of the first flap (23) are separated from the inside face (22) of the front cover (12) by locating ribs (53) projecting substantially perpendicularly from the inside face so that the safety shutter (21) is at a distance from said inside face (22) adapted to allow the second flap (24) to pivot correctly.<br>
9.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 6 to 8, wherein the first and second flaps (23, 24) are moulded from plastics material and the bottom (49) of the longitudinal passages (36) includes a window (48) adapted to facilitate removal of the first flap (23) from a mould.<br>
10.	A socket outlet as claimed in claim 9, wherein the window is further adapted to enable extraction of the compression spring (37) from the longitudinal passage (36) in order to demount the safety shutter (21).<br><br>
11.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 1 to 10, wherein the abutments are<br>
formed by ribs (50) projecting substantially perpendicularly from the inside face<br>
(22) of the front cover (12) and the first and second flaps (23, 24) of the safety<br>
shutter (21) abut against opposite sides of the ribs in the rest position.<br>
12.	A socket outlet as claimed in any of claims 1 to 11, wherein the front cover (12) includes locating ribs (52, 53) projecting from the inside face (22) of the cover (12) and contributing to guiding movement in translation of the first flap (23) and/or the second flap (24).</td>
