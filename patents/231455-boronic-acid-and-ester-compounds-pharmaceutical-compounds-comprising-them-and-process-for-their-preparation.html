				<td>BORONIC ACID AND ESTER COMPOUNDS, PHARMACEUTICAL<br>
COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING THEM AND PROCESS FOR THE RPREPRATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The  present   invention   relates   to   boronic   acid   and   boronic   ester<br>
compounds useful as proteasome inhibitors and modulation of apoptosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00021	The proteasome, (also refered to as multicatalytic protease (MCP),<br>
multicatalytic     proteinase,     multicatalytic     proteinase     complex,     multicatalytic<br>
endopeptidase complex, 20S, 26S, or ingensin) is a large, multiprotein complex present<br>
in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. It is a highly conserved<br>
cellular structure that is responsible for the ATP-dependent proteolysis of most cellular<br>
proteins  (Tanaka,  Biochem  Biophy.  Res.   Commun.,   1998,  247,   537).  The  26S<br>
proteasome consists of a 20S core catalytic complex that is capped at each end by a 19S<br>
regulatory subunit. The archaebacterial 20S proteasome contains fourteen copies of two<br>
distinct types of subunits, a and p, which form a cylindrical structure consisting of four<br>
stacked rings. The top and bottom rings contain seven α-subunits each, while the inner<br>
rings contain seven β-subunits. The more complex eukaryotic 20S proteasome is<br>
composed of about 15 distinct 20-30 kDa subunits and is characterized by three major<br>
activities with respect to peptide substrates. For example, the proteasome displays<br>
tryptic-,  chymotryptic-,  and  peptidylglutamyl   peptide-hydrolytic  activities  (Rivett,<br>
Biochem. J., 1993, 291, 1 and Orlowski, Biochemistry, 1990, 29, 10289). Further, the<br>
proteasome has a unique active site mechanism which is believed to utilize a threonine<br>
residue as the catalytic nucleophile (Seemuller, et al., Science, 1995, 268, 579).<br>
[0003]	The 26S proteasome is able to degrade proteins that have been marked by<br>
the addition of ubiquitin molecules. Typically, ubiquitin is attached to the e-amino<br>
groups of lysines in a multistep process utilizing ATP and El (ubiquitin activating) and<br>
E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating) enzymes. Multi-ubiquitinated substrate proteins are'<br>
recognized by the 26S proteasome and are degraded. The multi-ubiquitin chains are<br>
generally released from the complex and ubiquitin is recycled (Goldberg, et al., Nature,<br>
1992, 357, 375).<br><br>
[0004]	Numerous regulatory proteins are substrates for ubiquitin dependent<br>
proteolysis. Many of these proteins function as regulators of physiological as well as<br>
pathophysiological cellular processes. Alterations in proteasome activity have been<br>
implicated in a number of pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases such as<br>
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, as well as occlusion/ischaemia reperrusion<br>
injuries, and aging of the central nervous system.<br>
[0005]	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also plays a role in neoplastic growth.<br>
The regulated degradation of proteins such as cyclins, CDK2 inhibitors, and tumor<br>
suppressors is believed to be important in cell cycle progression and mitosis. A known<br>
substrate of the proteasome is the tumor suppressor p53 which is involved in several<br>
cellular processes (see, e.g., Ko, L. J. Genes Dev., 1996, 10, 1054). Tumor suppressor<br>
p53 has been shown to induce apoptosis in several haematopoietic cell lines (Oren, M,<br>
Semin. Cancer Biol., 1994, 5, 221). Induction of p53 leads to cell growth arrest in the<br>
G1 phase of the cell cycle as well as cell death by apoptosis. Tumor suppressor p53<br>
degradation is known to be carried out via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and<br>
disrupting p53 degradation by inhibition of the proteasome is a possible mode of<br>
inducing apoptosis.<br>
[0006]	The proteasome is also required for activation of the transcription factor<br>
NF-KB by degradation of its inhibitory protein, IKB (Palombella, et al., Cell, 1994, 78,<br>
773). NF-KB has a role in maintaining cell viability through the transcription of<br>
inhibitors of apoptosis. Blockade of NF-KB activity has been demonstrated to make cells<br>
more susceptible to apoptosis.<br>
[0007]	Several inhibitors of the proteolytic activity of the proteasome have been<br>
reported. See, for example, Kisselev, et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 2001, 8, 739.<br>
Lactacystin is a Streptomyces metabolite that specifically inhibits the proteolytic activity<br>
of the proteasome complex (Fenteany, et al., Science, 1995,268,726). This molecule is<br>
capable of inhibiting the proliferation of several cell types (Fenteany, et al., Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad Sci. USA, 1994, 91, 3358). It has been shown that lactacystin binds irreversibly,<br>
through its β-actone moiety, to a threonine residue located at the amino terminus of the<br>
β- subunit of the proteasome.<br>
[0008]	Peptide aldehydes have been reported to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like<br>
activity associated whh the proteasome (Vinitsky, et al., Biochemistry, 1992, 31, 9421;<br>
Tsubuki, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Common., 1993, 196, 1195; and Rock, et al.,<br><br>
Cell, 1994, 78, 761). Dipeptidyl aldehyde inhibitors that have IC50 values in the 10-100<br>
nM range in vitro (Iqbal, M., et al., J. MedChem., 1995, 38, 2276) have also been<br>
reported. A series of similarly potent in vitro inhibitors from α-ketocarbonyl and<br>
boronic ester derived dipeptides has also been reported (Iqbal, et al., Bioorg. Med.<br>
Chenu Lett., 1996, 6, 287, U.S. Pat Nos. 5,614,649; 5,830,870; 5,990,083; 6,096,778;<br>
6,310,057; U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2001/0012854, and WO 99/30707).<br>
[0009]	N-terminal peptidyl boronic ester and acid compounds have been<br>
reported previously (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,499,082 and 4,537,773; WO 91/13904; Kettner, et<br>
al., J. Biol. Chem., 1984, 259(24), 15106). These compounds are reported to be<br>
inhibitors of certain proteolytic enzymes. N-terminal tri-peptide boronic ester and acid<br>
compounds have been shown to inhibit the growth of cancer cells (U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,106,948). A broad class of N-terminal tri-peptide boronic ester and acid compounds<br>
and analogs thereof has been shown to inhibit renin (U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,841).<br>
[0010]	Various inhibitors of the peptidase activities of the proteasome have also<br>
been reported. See, e.g., Dick, et al., Biochemistry, 1991, 30, 2725; Goldberg, et al.,<br>
Nature, 1992, 357, 375; Goldberg, Eur. J. Biochem.,  1992, 203, 9; Orlowski,<br>

[0011]	Stein et al., U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/212,909, filed March 15,<br>
1994, report peptide aldehydes useful for reducing in an animal both the rate of loss of<br>
muscle mass and the rate of intracellular protein breakdown. The compounds are also<br>
said to reduce the rate of degradation of p53 protein in an animal. Palombella, et al.,<br>
WO 95/25533, report the use of peptide aldehydes to reduce the cellular content and<br>
activity of NF-kB in an animal by contacting cells of the animal with a peptide aldehyde<br>
inhibitor of proteasome function or ubiquitin conjugation. Goldberg and Rock, WO<br>
94/17816, report the use of proteasome inhibitors to inhibit MHC-I antigen presentation.<br>
Stein, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,617 report peptidyl aldehyde compounds as proteasome<br>
inhibitors useful for reducing the rate of degradation of protein in an animal. Inhibition<br>
of the 26S and 20S proteasome by indanone derivatives and a method for inhibiting cell<br>
proliferation using indanone derivatives are reported by Lum et al., U.S. Pat No.<br><br>
5,834,487. Alpha-ketoamide compounds useful for treating disorders mediated by 20S<br>
proteasome in mammals are reported in Wang et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,150. France, et<br>
al., WO 00/64863, report the use of 2,4-diamino-3-hydroxycarboxylic acid derivatives<br>
as proteasome inhibitors. Carboxylic acid derivatives as proteasome inhibitors are<br>
reported by Yamaguchi et al., EP 1166781. Ditzel, et al., EP 0 995 757 report bivalent<br>
inhibitors of the proteasome. 2-Aminobenzylstatine derivatives that inhibit non-<br>
covalently the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome have been reported by<br>
Garcia-Echeverria, et al., Bioorg. Med Chem. Lett., 2001, 11, 1317.<br>
[0012]	Some further proteasome inhibitors can contain boron moieties. For<br>
example, Drexler et al., WO 00/64467, report a method of selectively inducing<br>
apoptosis in activated endothelial cells or leukemic cells having a high expression level<br>
of c-rayc by using tetrapeptidic boronate containing proteasome inhibitors. Furet et al.,<br>
WO	02/096933	report	2-[[N-(2-amino-3-(heteroaryl	or<br>
aryl)propionyl)aminoacyl]amino]alkylboronic acids and esters for the therapeutic<br>
treatment of proliferative diseases in warm-blooded animals. U.S. Pat Nos. 6,083,903;<br>
6,297,217; 5,780454; 6,066,730; 6,297,217; 6,548,668; U.S. Patent Application Pub.<br>
No. 2002/0173488; and WO 96/13266 report boronic ester and acid compounds and a<br>
method for reducing the rate of degradation of proteins. A method for inhibiting viral<br>
replication using certain boronic acids and esters is also reported in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,465,433 and WO 01/02424. Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of boronic<br>
acids and novel boronic acid anhydrides and boronate ester compounds are reported by<br>
Plamondon, et al., U.S. Patent Application Pub. No. 2002/0188100. A series of di- and<br>
tripeptidyl boronic acids are shown to be inhibitors of 20S and 26S proteasome in<br>
Gardner, et al., Biochem. J., 2000,346,447.<br>
[0013]	Other boron-containing peptidyl and related compounds are reported in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,250,720; 5,242,904; 5,187,157; 5,159,060; 5,106,948; 4,963,655;<br>
4,499,082; and WO 89/09225, WO/98/17679, WO 98/22496, WO 00/66557, WO<br>
02/059130, WO 03/15706, WO 96/12499, WO 95/20603, WO 95/09838, WO 94/25051,<br>
WO 94/25049, WO 94/04653, WO 02/08187, EP 632026, and EP 354522.<br>
[0014]	A great interest exists, as evidenced by the above references, in drugs<br>
which can modulate proteasome activity. For example, molecules capable of inhibiting<br>
proteasome activity can arrest or delay cancer progression by interfering with the<br><br>
ordered degradation of cell cycle proteins or tumor suppressors. Accordingly, there is an<br>
ongoing need for new and/or unproved inhibitors of proteasome.<br>

[0090]	As used herein, the phrase "boronic acid" refers to a compound<br>
containing a B(OH)2 moiety. In some embodiments, boronic acid compounds can form<br>
oligomeric anhydrides by dehydration of the boronic moiety. For example, Snyder, et<br>
al., J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1958,80,3611 report oligomeric arylboronic acids. Thus, unless<br>
otherwise indicated, "boronic acid", or a chemical formula containing a -B(OH)2<br>
moiety, is intended to encompass free boronic acids, oligomeric anhydrides, including<br>
but not limited to, dimers, timers, tetramers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0091]	As used herein, "boronic acid anhydride" or "boronic anhydride" refers<br>
to a compound formed by the combination of two or more molecules of a boronic acid<br>
compound of Formula (I), with loss of one or more water molecules from the boronic<br>
acid moieties. When contacted with water, the boronic acid anhydride compound can be<br>
hydrated to release free boronic acid compound. In some embodiments, the boronic acid<br>
anhydride structure can contain two, three, four, or more boronic acid units and can have<br>
a cyclic or linear configuration. In some embodiments, the boronic acid anhydride<br>
compound exists substantially in a single oligomeric form; however, boronic acid<br>
anhydrides also encompass mixtures of different oligomeric boronic acid anhydride as<br>
well as free boronic acids.<br>

further embodiments, at least about 85, about 90, about 95, or about 99 % of the boronic<br>
acid present in the boronic acid anhydride exists in a single oligomeric anhydride form.<br>
In some embodiments, the boronic acid anhydride compound consists essentially of a<br>
single oligomeric boronic acid anhydride. In yet further embodiments, the boronic acid<br>
anhydride compound consists of a single oligomeric boronic acid anhydride. In further<br>
embodiments, the boronic acid anhydride compound contains a boroxine of Formula<br>
(III), wherein t is 1.<br>

of a guanidino moiety can be referred to as a "guanidino protecting group." Amino and<br>
guanidino protecting groups can have the formulas aryl-SO2, alkyl-SO2, aryl-C(=O)-,<br>
aralkyl-C(O)-, alkyl-C(=O)-, aryl-OC(=O)-, aralkyl-OC(=O)- alkyl-OC(=O)- aryl-<br>
NHC(=O)-, alkyl-NHC(=O)- and me like, wherein said alkyl, aryl and aralkyl groups<br>
may be substituted or unsubstituted. Example amino and guanidino protecting groups<br>
can also include t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC), fluorenylmemoxycarbonyl (Fmoc),<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), and a phthalimido group. Other protecting groups include the<br>
following moieties:<br><br>

[00144]	As used herein, "substituted" indicates that at least one hydrogen atom of<br>
a chemical group is replaced by a non-hydrogen moiety. Example substituents include<br>
F, Cl, Br, I, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkenyl, C1-C6, alkynyl, haloalkyl, NRERF, N3, NO2, CN,<br>

C1-C6 alkyl. Alternatively, RE and RF may be combined, with the nitrogen to which they<br>
are attached, to form a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring, for example pyrrolidinyl,<br>
piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, and N-methylpiperazinyl. When a chemical group<br><br><br>
herein is "substituted" it may have up to the full valance of substitution, provided the<br>
resulting compound is a stable compound or stable structure; for example, a methyl<br>
group may be substituted by 1, 2, or 3 substituents, a methylene group may be<br>
substituted by 1 or 2 substituents, a phenyl group may be substituted by 1, 2, 3,4, or 5<br>
substituents, and the like.<br>
[00145]	As used herein, "leaving group" refers to any group that can be replaced<br>
by a nucleophile upon nucleophilic substitution. Example leaving groups include, halo<br>
(F, Cl, Br, I), hydroxyl, alkoxy, mercapto, thioalkoxy, triflate, alkylsulfonyl, substituted<br>
alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, substituted arylsulfonate, heterocyclosulfonate or<br>

[00146]	As used herein "stable compound" or "stable structure" refers to a<br>
compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity<br>
from a reaction mixture, and preferably capable of formulation into an efficacious<br>
therapeutic agent. The present invention is directed only to stable compounds.<br>
[00147]	The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or<br>
more stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are<br>
intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain<br>
asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic<br>
forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically active starting<br>
materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by<br>
stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C—N double bonds, and<br>
the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable<br>
isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of<br>
the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture<br>
of isomers or as separated isomeric forms.<br>
[00148]	In addition to the above, the compounds herein described may have<br>
asymmetric centers which result in one enantiomer of a compound of Formula (I)<br>
demonstrating superior biological activity over the opposite enantiomer. Bom of the<br>
configurations are considered part of the invention. For example, the R2 substituent of a<br><br>
compound of Formula (I) may exist in either an S or R configuration. An example of a<br>
preferred enantiomeric configuration of the invention is a compound of Formula (I-s):<br><br>
but is not intended to be limited to this example.  When required, separation of the<br>
racemic material can be achieved by methods known in the art<br>
[00149]	Compounds of the invention can also include tautomeric forms, such as<br>
keto-enol tautomers. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into<br>
one form by appropriate substitution.<br>
[00150]	Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms<br>
occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having<br>
the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen<br>
include tritium and deuterium.<br>
[00151]	The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to<br>
those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human<br>
beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other<br>
problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
[00152]	The present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of<br>
the compounds described herein. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts"<br>
refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is<br>
modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid<br>
salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as<br>
carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present<br>
invention include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of<br>
the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids.<br>
For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic<br>
acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the<br><br>
like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic,<br>
glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic,<br>
phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric,<br>
toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like. The<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the<br>
parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical<br>
methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of<br>
these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water<br>
or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like<br>
ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable<br>
salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing<br>
Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418 and in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2<br>
(1977), the disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Synthesis<br>
[00153]	Compounds of the invention, including salts and solvates thereof, can be<br>
prepared using known organic synthesis techniques and can be synthesized according to<br>
any of numerous possible synthetic routes.<br>
[00154]	The reactions for preparing compounds of the invention can be carried<br>
out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic<br>
synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially nonreactive with the starting materials<br>
(reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are<br>
carried out, i.e., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to<br>
the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a<br>
mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable<br>
solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected.<br>
[00155]	Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and<br>
deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and<br>
the selection of appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled<br>
in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in T.W.<br>
Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd. Ed., Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, Inc., New York (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
[00156]	Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in<br>
the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such<br>
as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C) infrared spectroscopy,<br>
spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), or mass spectrometry, or by chromatography such<br>
as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography.<br>
[00157]	Compounds of the invention can be prepared according to methods for<br>
preparing aminoboronic acids, esters thereof, and related compounds described in the<br>
art, such as in U.S. Pat No. 4,537,773, and in U.S. Pat No. 5,614,649, each of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the present<br>
compounds can be prepared by the sequential coupling of three fragment components<br>
(F1, F2, and F3).<br>
F1 Fragment<br>
[00158]	Synthesis of compounds of the invention can involve a boron-containing<br>
fragment (F1) having a structure indicated by Formula (A).<br><br>
[00159]	The boronic ester moiety of Fl can include, for example, a diol ester such<br>
as is indicated by the loop connecting oxygen atoms in Formula (A).<br>
[00160]	Stereochemistry at the carbon atom alpha to the boron atom in Formula<br>
(A) can be controlled using an asymmetric boronic ester group in the preparation of F1.<br>
For example, pinanediol esters of boronic acid can facilitate the preparation or<br>
stereochemically pure, or substantially stereochemically pure, Ft fragment. As an<br>
example, the F1 fragment can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula (B)<br>
(showing a pinanediol boronic ester obtained from (+)-pinanediol) with a strong base<br>
(e.g., lithium diisopropylamide or lithium dicyclohexylamide) in the presence of<br>
dichloromethane or dibromomethane, followed by addition of a Lewis acid, (e.g., ZnCl2,<br>
ZnBr2, or FeCl3) to yleld a compound of Formula (C) (where L is halo) having a newly<br>
introduced stereocenter at the carbon alpha to the boron.<br><br><br>
[00161]	The compound of Formula (C) can, in turn, be reacted with an alkali<br>
amide (e.g., lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, and<br>
potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide) or other nucleophile that effectively inverts the<br>
newly formed stereocenter (such as by an SN2 type mechanism) and introduces an<br>
amine group (NR2) in place of the halo group (e.g., chloro), forming a compound.of<br>
Formula (D) (where R can be, e.g., alkyl, Si(alkyl)3, aryl, or aralkyl).<br><br>
[00162]	The compound of Formula (D) can be further reacted with an agent<br>
capable of converting the NR2 group to NH2, or salt thereof, to form an F1 fragment<br>
substantially capable of coupling with a further fragment through the amine. A suitable<br>
agent for converting the NR2 group to NH2 can be a protic acid such as HC1 such as<br>
when R is a silyl group (e.g., trimethylsilyl).<br>
[00163]	The compound of Formula (B) can also be prepared according to a two<br>
step procedure involving reaction of a trialkoxyborane, preferably triisopropoxyborane,<br>
with (1S, 2S, 3R, 5S)-(+) pinanediol, to give a mono-alkoxy [(1S, 2S, 3R, 5S)-(+)<br>
pinanediol] borane intermediate wherein two of the alkoxy groups of the trialkoxy<br>
borane have been replaced by (1S, 2S, 3R, 5S)-(+) pinanediol. This mixed pinanediol<br>
alkoxy borane, upon reaction with the appropriate organometallic derivative, e.g. the<br><br>
Grignard reagent R1CH2MgBr or the alkyl lithium R1CH2Li, gives compound (B) in<br>
-good ylelds and purities. The process starting from triisopropoxyborane to give the<br>
intermediate mixed pinanediol isopropoxy borane (F) and the compounds of formula (B)<br>
is depicted in the following scheme:<br><br>
»<br>
and exemplified in Example A.2, herein.<br>
[00164]	Accordingly, the present invention is further directed to methods of<br>
preparing compounds of Formula (IT):<br><br>
wherein the variable constituents are defined hereinabove, by the process of a) reacting<br>
a diol of Formula (Il-b): <br>
with an appropriate trialkoxyborane of Formula (II-a):<br><br><br>
wherein each R17 is, independently, C1-C10 alkyl or C3-C10 cycloalkyl;<br>
for a time and under conditions suitable for forming a mixed trialkoxyborane<br>
intermediate of Formula (II-c):<br>
v - -   - j<br>
and reacting the intermediate of Formula (H-c) with either i) a reagent of formula<br>
R1CH2MXhal, wherein M is a metal and X   is a halogen atom, or ii) a reagent of<br>
formula R1CH2Li, for a time and under conditions suitable for forming the compound<br>
of Formula (II).<br>
[00165]	In some embodiments, R17 is C1-C4 alkyl.<br>
[00166]	In some embodiments, R17 is isopropyl.<br>
[00167]	In some embodiments, the diol of Formula (II-b) is pinanediol, pinacol,<br>
bicyclohexyl-1,1'-diol, 1,2-etbanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 2,3-butanediol,<br>
1,1,2,2-tetramethylethanediol, 1,2-diisopropylethanediol, 5,6-decanediol,<br>
1,2-dicyclohexylethanediol, bicyclohexyl-1,1'-diol, diethanolamine, or<br>
1,2-diphenyl-1,2-ethanediol.<br>
[00168]	In some embodiments, the diol of Formula (II-b) is pinanediol.<br>
[00169]	In some embodiments, the Formula R1CH2MXha1 is a Grignard reagent.<br>
[00170]	In some embodiments, the Formula R1CH2MXhal is R1CH2MgBr.<br>
[00171]	In some embodiments, R1 is isopropyl.<br>
[00172]	In some embodiments, the present invention provides a process for<br>
preparing a compound of Formula (Il-i):<br><br>
comprising:<br><br>
a) reacting (1S, 2S, 3R, 5S)-(+)-pinanediol with triisopropoxy borane for a time and<br>
under conditions suitable for forming an intermediate of Formula (II-ii):<br><br>
and b) reacting the intermediate of Formula (II-ii) with isobutyl magnesium bromide for<br>
a time and under conditions suitable for forming the compound of Formula (II-i).<br>
[00173]	In some embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of<br>
Formula (II-ii): <br>
[00174]	the reacting steps can be carried out in any suitable solvent mat is non-<br>
reactive with the reagents and products and allows combining of reagents at lowered<br>
temperatures (e.g., temperatures colder than room temperature). Suitable solvents<br>
include ethers such as dimethoxymethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxane, 1,4-dioxane,<br>
furan, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether,<br>
diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, triethylene glycol<br>
dimethyl ether, anisole, or t-butyl methyl ether. In some embodiments, the ether solvent<br>
contains tetrahydrofuran and/or diethyl ether.<br>
[00175]	The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out at<br>
appropriate temperatures which can be readily determined by the skilled artisan.<br>
Reaction temperatures will depend on, for example, the melting and boiling points of the<br>
reagents and solvent, if present; the thermodynamics of the reaction (e.g., vigorously<br>
exothermic reactions may need to be carried out at reduced temperatures); and the<br>
kinetics of the reaction (e.g., a high activation energy barrier may need elevated<br>
temperatures). "Elevated temperature" refers to temperatures above room temperature<br>
(about 22 °C) and "reduced temperature" refers to temperatures below room<br>
temperature.<br><br>
[00176]	In some embodiments, suitable temperatures are reduced temperatures.<br>
The reaction of the trialkoxyborane and diol to prepare a mixed trialkoxyborane<br>
intermediate can be carried out, for example, at a temperature of about -20 to about 10<br>
°C. In some embodiments, the reaction of the trialkoxyborane and diol can be carried<br>
out at about 0 °C. The reaction of the mixed trialkoxyborane intermediate with the<br>
organometallic reagent R1CH2MXhal or the alkyl lithium reagent R1CH2Li can be carried<br>
out, for example, at temperature from about -100 to about -20 °C. In some<br>
embodiments, the reaction of the mixed trialkoxyborane intermediate and R1CH2MXhal<br>
is carried out at about -78 °C.<br>
[00177]	The reactions of the processes described herein can be carried out in air<br>
or under an inert atomosphere. Typically, reactions containing reagents or products that<br>
are substantially reactive with air can be carried out using air-sensitive synthetic<br>
techniques that are well known to the skilled artisan.<br>
B.       F2 Fragment<br>
[00178]	The mid-section of compounds  of the present invention can be<br>
represented by fragment F2 which couples to fragment F1 by peptide bond formation for<br>
form an F2-F1 intermediate. Methods for coupling compounds through peptide bonds,<br>
or amide bonds, are well known in the art and described, for example, in The Peptides:<br>
Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol. I., eds. Gross, et al., Academic Press, 1979. An<br>
example F2 fragment is provided in Formula (E) (Pg is an amino protecting group, R2 is<br>
defined herein). Additionally, protection of the amino group of amino acids using Boc<br>
or other amino protecting groups is well known in the art.<br><br>
[00179]	Compounds of Formula (E) that are amino acids or amino acid<br>
derivatives are available commercially or prepared by routine methods. For example,<br>
aza-serines can be prepared generally by the Hoffman Rearrangement (Hoffman's<br>
Reaction) using, for example, asparagine where the amide of the asparagine side chain is<br><br>
converted to an amine (which can be subsequently protected). Methods for carrylng out<br>
Hoffman Rearrangements, such as for amino acids, are known in the art and also<br>
provided in the Examples below. Additionally aza-serines can be prepared as disclosed<br>
in Zhang, et al. J. Org. Chem., 1997,62,6918-6920. Boc-cyanoarginine derivatives can<br>
be prepared as disclosed in Wagenaar et al., J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58, 4331-4338.<br>
Synthesis of F2 fragments wherein R2 is -CH2CH2CH2NHC(=NR4)NH-Y, -<br>
CH2CONR5R6, -CH2NHCONR5R6, -CH2NR9R10, or -CH(R7)ZR8 are further disclosed<br>
herein. F2 fragments can be obtained from commercial sources or made by methods<br>
known to one skilled in the art<br>
C.       F3 Fragments<br>
[00180]	A former fragment (F3) can be coupled to the F2 fragment of the F2-F1<br>
intermediate by any of various means such as by nucleophilic substitution or addition<br>
reactions where, for example, F2 contains a nucleophile (e.g., amine) and F3 contains an<br>
electrophile (e.g., CO, SO2, and the like) and optionally a leaving group (e.g., halo,<br>
hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, and the like). Example F3 fragments can<br>
have the formula RXCOXL, RXSO2XL, RXNCO, or RXHCO, (e.g., RX can be RA, RB, or<br>
Rc as defined herein and XL can be a leaving group). Coupling of RxCOXL (such as<br>
When XL is OH) to the F2-F1 intermediate can be carried out according to standard<br>
procedures for peptide bond formation to prepare compounds having the formula F3-F2- F1<br>
where the F3 and F2 fragments are coupled via an amide bond. In other<br>
embodiments, F3 and F2 can be coupled by a sulfonylamino linkage prepared by<br>
reacting RXSO2XL with the F2-F1 intermediate in which an amino moiety on the F2-F1<br>
intermediate displaces the XL leaving group of RXSO2XL. Additionally, reaction of<br>
RxNCO with an amino moiety of the F2-F1 intermediate can result in a urea linkage (-<br>
HNCONH-), while reaction of RXHCO with an amino moiety of the F2-F1 intermediate<br>
followed by reduction of the resulting imine moiety can form an amine linkage. Other<br>
coupling means are known in the art and are also suitable. F3 fragments can be obtained<br>
from commercial sources or made by methods known in the art<br>
[00181]	Certain compounds of the invention wherein R2 is -(CH2)dCH(R7)NR9R10<br>
can be prepared by removal of an R10 amino protecting group to form the corresponding<br>
deprotected compound wherein R10 is H. This deprotected compound can be reacted<br>
with a reagent having the formula R10aXL, wherein R10a has the same meaning as R10<br><br>
with the exception of H and XL is a leaving group such as halo or a sulfonic acid<br>
derivative, or wherein R10a and XL taken together represent, for example, a reactive<br>
alkyl, carbocyclyl or heterocarbocyclyl isocyanate, or an alkyl, carbocyclyl,<br>
heterocarbocyclyl sulphonylisocyanate. For example, the compound of Example D.26<br>
can be prepared by the deprotection of the benzyloxycarbonyl group of Example D.16.6<br>
to give Example D.17, from which the azaserine nitrogen can be subsequently acylated.<br>
[00182]	The present invention further provides methods for preparing azaserine<br>
(e.g., where R2 is -CH2NH2) compounds of Formula I. In general, the azaserine group<br>
can be generated by removal of a benzyloxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)OCH2(C6H5)) which<br>
is attached to one of the nitrogens of the azaserine group (e.g., compounds of Formula I<br>
where R2 is -CH2NR9R10 and R9 is H and R'° is -C(=O)OCH2(C6H5)). Removal of the<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl group can be carried out by treatment with a reducing agent, such as<br>
a hydrogenation reagent. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation reagent contains H2<br>
which is optionally used in the presence of a metal catalyst (e.g., Pd/C 10%).<br>
Hydrogenation can be further carried out in the presence of a protic acid such as HC1<br>
and in a suitable hydrogenation solvent containing, for example, an alcohol and/or an<br>
ether solvent. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation solvent contains an ether such<br>
as 1,4-dioxane. In further embodiments, the hydrogenation solvent cotains an alcohol<br>
such as methanol. In further embodiments, the hydrogenation solvent contains a<br>
mixture of alcohol and ether. An example preparation of an azaserine compound<br>
according to this process is provided, for example, in Example D.17. Reaction<br>
parameters including temperature, pressure, atomosphere and the like are readily<br>
determined by one skilled in the art of chemical synthesis and reaction progress can be<br>
monitored by routine methods including, e.g., NMR.<br>

UTILITY<br>
Compound Activity<br>
[00310]	The present compounds can inhibit proteasome activity. Table F-l below<br>
provides data related to several Example compounds of the invention with respect to, for<br>
example, ability to inhibit proteasome activity.<br>
Methods and Compositions<br>
[00311]	Compounds  of the  present  invention  can  inhibit  the  activity  of<br>
proteasome leading to the inhibition or blocking of a variety of intracellular functions<br>
with which the proteasome is directly or indirectly associated. For example, proteasome<br>
inhibitors can modulate, such as induce, apoptosis in a cell. In some embodiments, the<br><br>
compounds herein can kill tumor cells by induction of apoptosis. Thus, the present<br>
compounds can be used to treat cancer, tumors or other proliferative disorders.<br>
[00312]	In further embodiments, inhibition of proteasome function by compounds<br>
of the invention can inhibit the activation or processing of transcription factor NF-KB.<br>
This protein plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in the immune and<br>
inflammatory responses as well as in cell viability. Inhibition of proteasome function<br>
can also inhibit the ubiquitination/proteolysis pathway. This pathway catalyzes, inter<br>
alia, selective degradation of highly abnormal proteins and short-lived regulatory<br>
proteins. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention can prevent the<br>
degradation of p53 which is typically degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway.<br>
The ubiquitination/proteolysis pathway also is involved in the processing of internalized<br>
cellular or viral antigens into antigenic peptides that bind to MHC-I molecules. Thus,<br>
the compounds of the invention can be used to reduce the activity of the cytosolic ATP-<br>
ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system in a number of cell types.<br>
[00313]	Accordingly, the usefulness of such compounds can include therapeutics,<br>
such as the treatment of various diseases or disorders associated with proteasome. The<br>
methods include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the<br>
invention, or composition thereof, to a mammal, such as a human having a disease or<br>
disorder associated with  proteasome. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount"<br>
refers to an amount sufficient to prevent, alleviate, or ameliorate any phenomenon, such<br>
as a cause or symptom, known in the art to be associated with the disease or disorder.<br>
[00314]	Treatable diseases or disorders (abnormal physical conditions) can be<br>
associated with either normal or abnormal activities of proteasome, such as the<br>
regulation of apoptosis. Numerous diseases or disorders that are associated with<br>
proteasome, or that are desirably treated by induction of apoptosis, are known and<br>
include, for example, various cancers and tumors including those associated with skin,<br>
prostate, colorectal, pancreas, kidney, ovary, mammary, liver, tongue, lung, and smooth<br>
muscle tissues. Preferred tumors that can be treated with proteasome inhibitors include,<br>
but are not limited to hematological tumors, such as, for example, leukemias,<br>
lymphomas, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, multiple myeloma, as well as solid<br>
tumors such as, for example, colorectal, mammary, prostate, lung, and pancreas tumors.<br>
In order to elicit therapeutic effects, the proteasome inhibitors can be administered to<br>
patients as single agents or in combination with one or more antitumor or anticancer<br><br>
agent and/or radiotherapy. Examples of other anti-tumor or anti-cancer agents which can<br>
be advantageously administered concomitantly with a proteasome inhibitor include but<br>
are not limited to, adriamycin, daunomycin, methotrexate, vincristin, 6-mercaptopurine,<br>
cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, 5-FU, hexamethylmelamine, carboplatin,<br>
cisplatin, idarubycin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan,' irinotecam, gemcitabine, L-PAM,<br>
BCNU and VP-16. Methods for determining apoptosis in vitro are well known in the art<br>
and kits are available commercially. See for example the Apo-ONE™ Homogeneous<br>
Caspase-3/7 Assay from Promega Corporation, Madison WI, USA (Technical Bulletin<br>
No. 295, revised 2/02, Promega Corporation).<br>
[00315]	Further diseases or disorders associated with the proteasome include<br>
accelerated or enhanced proteolysis that occurs in atrophylng muscles, such as is often<br>
associated with activation of a nonlysomal ATP-requiring process involving ubiquitin.<br>
Accelerated or enhanced proteolysis can be the result of any of numerous causes<br>
including sepsis, burns, trauma, cancer, infection, neurodegenerative diseases such as<br>
muscular dystrophy, acidosis, or spinal/nerve injuries, corticosteroid use, fever, stress,<br>
and starvation. Compounds of the invention can be tested for inhibition of muscle<br>
wastage by any various procedures known in the art such as by measuring urinary<br>
excretion of modified amino acid 3-methylhistidine (see, e.g., Young, et al., Federation<br>
Proc, 1978, 37,229).<br>
[00316]	Compounds of the present invention can be further used to treat or<br>
prevent diseases or disorders associated with activity of NF-KB including for example,<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and inflammatory disorders resulting<br>
from, for example, transplantation rejection, arthritis, infection, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, asthma, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, restenosis, and autoimmune<br>
diseases. Accordingly, a process that prevents activation of NF-KB in patients suffering<br>
from such a disease would be therapeutically beneficial. Inhibition of the NF-KB activity<br>
can be measured by using a DNA binding assay such a described in Palombella, et al.,<br>
Cell, 1994, 78, 773.<br>
[00317]	Those of ordinary skill in the art can readily identify individuals who are<br>
prone to or suspected of suffering from such diseases or disorders using standard<br>
diagnostic techniques.<br>

Assay for Chymotrypsin-like Activity of 20S Human Erythrocyte Proteasome<br>
(HEP)<br>
[00318]	Proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity of compounds of the invention<br>
was assayed according to the following procedure.<br>
[00319]	In 96-well microtiter plates, 20S Human Erythrocyte Proteasome (HEP),<br>
purchased from Immatics Biotechnologies Inc., Tubingen, Germany was plated at 0.2<br>
μg/mL (about 0.6 nM catalytic sites) in 0.04% SDS 20mM Tris buffer. A fluorimetric<br>
substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin),<br>
purchased from Sigma Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA was added to a final concentration of<br>
100 μM from a stock solution of 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide. Reaction volumes were<br>
100 μl per well. After incubation for various periods of time at 37 °C, the concentration<br>
of free AMC (aminomethylcoumarin) was determined on a Perkin Elmer HTS 7000<br>
Plus microplate reader, excitation 370 nM and emission 465nM. Proteasome activity<br>
was determined under conditions in which substrate hydrolysis increased linearly with<br>
time and the change in fluorescence signal was proportional to the concentration of free<br>
AMC.<br>

Assay for Activity of α-Chymotrypsin<br>
[00320]	In 96-well microtiter plates bovine a-chymotrypsin, purchased from<br>
Sigma Inc., was plated at 10 ng/mL (about 2 pM catalytic sites) in 0.5 M NaCl 50mM<br>
Hepes buffer. A fluorimetric substrate Suc-AAPF-AMC (succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-7-<br>
amido-4-methylcoumarin), purchased from Sigma Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA was added<br>
to a final concentration of 25 μM from a stock solution of 10 mM in dimethylsulfoxide.<br>
Reaction volumes were 100 μl per well. After incubation for various periods of time at<br>
room temperature, the concentration of free AMC was determined on a Perkin Elmer<br>
HTS 7000 Plus microplate reader, excitation 370 nM and emission 465 nM. α-<br>
Chymotrypsin activity was determined under conditions in which substrate hydrolysis<br>
increased linearly with time and the change in fluorescence signal was proportional to<br>
the concentration of free AMC.<br>

Determination of IC50 Values for HEP and α-Chymotrypsin Inhibitors<br><br>
[00321]	IC50 values are typically defined as the concentration of a compound<br>
necessary to produce 50% inhibition of the enzyme's activity. IC50 values are useful<br>
indicators of the activity of a compound for its designated use. The proteasome<br>
inhibitors of the invention can be considered active if they have IC50 values of less than<br>
about 1 micromolar for inhibition of human erythrocyte proteasome (HEP). In some<br>
embodiments, the inhibitors show some specificity for HEP and the ratio of the IC50 for<br>
inhibition of bovine α-chymotrypsin versus the IC50 for inhibition of HEP, i.e, IC50 (α-<br>
Chymotripsin)/ IC50 (HEP), is greater then about 100.<br>
[00322]	Inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like activity of HEP and of bovine α-<br>
chymotrypsin was determined by incubating the enzyme with various concentrations of<br>
putative inhibitors for 15 minutes at 37 °C (or room temperature for α-chymotrypsin)<br>
prior to the addition of substrate. Each experimental condition was evaluated in<br>
triplicate, and replicate experiments were performed for the inhibitors described herein.<br>
[00323]	Compounds of the present invention are considered active in the above<br>
identified assay if their IC50 values for inhibition of HEP are less than 1000 nanoMolar.<br>
Preferably compounds of the present invention will have IC50 values for inhibition of<br>
HEP less than 100 nanoMolar. More preferably compounds of the present invention will<br>
have IC50 values for inhibition of HEP less than 10 nanoMolar. Compounds of the<br>
present invention have demonstrated, in the above identified assay, IC50 values for<br>
inhibition of HEP less than 1000 nanoMolar.<br>

Cellular Assay for Chymotrypsin-like activity of Proteasome in Molt-4 Cell Line<br>
[00324]	The chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasome in Molt-4 cells (human<br>
leukemia) was assayed according to the following procedure. A brief description of the<br>
method was published previously (Harding et al., J. Immunol., 1995,155, 1767).<br>
[00325]	Molt-4 cells were washed and resuspended in HEPES-buffered Saline<br>
(5.4 mM KC1, 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM Glucose, 1.5 raM MgSO4, 1 mM Na pyruvate, 20<br>
mM Hepes) and plated in 96-well microtiter white plates to a final concentration of<br>
6x106 cells/mL. Then various 5X proteasome inhibitor concentrations (or diluted DMSO<br>
for controls), prepared from 250X DMSO solutions by diluting 50-fold using HEPES-<br>
buffered saline, were added to the plate to a final IX concentration. After 15 minutes<br>
incubation at 37°C, a fluorimetric cell  permeable substrate  (MeOSuc-FLF-AFC)<br><br><br>
(methoxysuccinyl-Phe-Leu-Phe-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) purchased from<br>
Enzyme Systems Products, catalogue number AFC-88, was added to each well at a final<br>
concentration of 25 uM from a stock solution of 20 mM in DMSO. Reaction volumes<br>
were 100 μl per well.<br>
[00326]	The concentration of free AFC was monitored every 1.5 min for 30 min<br>
(22 cycles) on a Polastar Optima, BMG Labtechnologies microplate reader, using an<br>
excitation wavelength of 390 nm and emission wavelength of 520 nm. Proteasome<br>
activity was determined under conditions in which substrate hydrolysis increased<br>
linearly with time and the change in fluorescent signal was proportional to the<br>
concentration of free AFC.<br>

Determination of EC50 values for proteasome inhibitors in MOLT-4 Cell Line<br>
[00327]	EC50 values are typically defined as the concentration of a compound<br>
required to produce an inhibition of the enzyme's activity halfway between the<br>
minimum and the maximum response (0% and 85-90% respectively for this assay). EC50<br>
values are useful indicators of the activity of a compound for its designated use. The<br>
compounds of the invention can be considered active if they have an EC50 of less than<br>
about 10 micromolar.<br>
[00328]	Inhibition of chymotrypsin-like activity of proteasome in Molt-4 cells<br>
was determined by incubating cells with various concentrations of putative inhibitors for<br>
15 minutes at 37°C prior to the addition of substrate. Each experimental condition was<br>
evaluated in triplicate, and replicate experiments were performed for the inhibitors<br>
described herein.<br>
[00329]	Compounds of the present invention are considered active in the above<br>
identified assay if their EC50 values for proteasome inhibition in MOLT-4 are less than<br>
10 microMolar. Preferably compounds of the present invention will have EC50 values<br>
for proteasome inhibition in MOLT-4 less than 2 microMolar. More preferably<br>
compounds of the present invention will have EC50 values for proteasome inhibition in<br>
MOLT-4 less than 200 nanomolar. Compounds of the present invention have<br>
demonstrated, in the above identified assay, EC50 values for proteasome inhibition in<br>
MOLT-4 cells of less than 10 microMolar.<br><br>
Example F<br>
Assay for Trypsin-like Activity of the Proteasome<br>
[00330]	The trypsin-like activity of human proteasome can be assayed as<br>
described above with the following modifications. Reactions can be carried out in Tris-<br>
glycerol buffer (pH 9.5) supplemented with 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and the substrate<br>
can be a fluorogenic substrate such as benzyloxycarbonyl—Phe—Arg—AMC (100 μM).<br>
[00331]	After incubation for various periods of time at 37 °C, the concentration<br>
of free AMC can be determined on a Fluoroskan II spectrofluorimeter with an excitation<br>
filter of 390 nm and an emission filter of 460 nm. Protease activity can be determined<br>
under conditions in which substrate hydrolysis increases linearly with time and the<br>
change in fluorescence is proportional to the concentration of free AMC.<br>
Example G<br>
In vivo Inhibition of Cellular Muscle Breakdown<br>
[00332]	The effect of inhibitors on the unweighting atrophy of the soleus muscle<br>
in juvenile rats can be determined by, for example, the procedures described in Tischler,<br>
Metabolism, 1990, 39, 756. For example, juvenile female Sprague-Dawley rats (80-90<br>
g) can be tail-cast, hind limb suspended as described in Jaspers, et al., J. Appl. Physiol.,<br>
1984, 57,1472. The animal's hind limbs can be elevated above the floor of the cage with<br>
each animal housed individually. Animals can have free access to food and water, and<br>
can be weighed at the time of suspension and at time of termination. During the<br>
suspension period the animals can be checked daily to ensure that their toes are not<br>
touching the floor of the cage, and that there is no swelling of the tail due to the cast.<br>
Experimental Design—Part 1<br>
[00333]	Each experiment can begin with the suspension of 20 rats which are<br>
randomly divided into 4 groups of 5 animals each. Group A can be suspended for 2<br>
days, providing baseline data to approximate the soleus muscle size in other animals<br>
suspended for longer times. Average body weights for the groups at the outset of the<br>
study can be compared and used as a correction factor for body size differences. Group<br>
B can be a second control group which has the soleus of one limb treated with an<br>
aqueous solution of mersalyl after two days of unweighting, to demonstrate the ability to<br>
slow muscle atrophy during unweighting, for each group of animals. At 2 days after<br><br><br>
unweighting commences, an aqueous solution of mersalyl (200 nM; 4 μL /100 g initial<br>
body wt) can be injected into one soleus. The contralateral muscle can be injected with a<br>
similar volume of 0.9% saline ("Vehicle"). The animals can be maintained under<br>
Innovar-vet (10 μX/100 g body wt) tranquilization during the in situ injection procedure.<br>
After the injections, the animals can be suspended for an additional 24 hours and the<br>
soleus can be removed. Groups C and D for each experiment can be used for testing<br>
each of two different embodiments of the disclosed compounds. Animals can be treated<br>
as in group B, except that 1 mM proteasome inhibitor, contained in dimethysulfoxide<br>
(DMSO), can be injected into the soleus of one leg and DMSO only into the<br>
contralateral soleus. Thus each experiment consists of two control groups and the testing<br>
of proteasome inhibitors of the invention. The completion of five such experiments with<br>
different pairs of inhibitors provides for an "n" value of 10 for testing each inhibitor and<br>
each can be tested in two different shipments of animals.<br>
Processing of the Soleus Muscle—Part 1<br>
[00334]	After the animal is sacrificed, the soleus can be excised, trimmed of fat<br>
and connective tissue, and carefully weighed. The muscle can then homogenized in 10%<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the precipitated protein pelleted by centrifugation. The<br>
pellet can then be washed once with 10% TCA and once with ethanol:ether (1:1). The<br>
final pellet can be solubilized in 4 ml of IN sodium hydroxide. The sample can be then<br>
analyzed for protein content by the biuret procedure, using albumin as a standard.<br>
Data Analysis—Part 1<br>
[00335]	The effect of inhibitors on total muscle protein content can be examined<br>
primarily by paired comparison with the untreated contralateral muscle. The ratio of<br>
contents can be calculated and then analyzed statistically by analysis of variance<br>
("ANOVA"). The left leg can always be the treated leg so that the protein content ratios<br>
can be compared to the non-treated control animals as well. In this way, a significant<br>
difference can be shown by comparing the protein content of the two legs, as well as the<br>
relative effectiveness of the tested inhibitors. A paired student test can also be<br>
performed for the effect of each separate treatment. The non-treated control data also<br>
provide an estimate of protein content of day 2. This allows approximation of the<br>
protein changes over the 24 hours of treatment for each of the Groups B, C, and D.<br><br>
Experimental Design-Part 2<br>
[00336]	Each experiment can consist of 10 animals with groups of 5 animals<br>
being tested with one of the inhibitors for its effect on protein synthesis. Control animals<br>
are not needed for this aspect of the study as the contralateral DMSO-treated muscle<br>
serves as the paired control for the inhibitor-treated muscle. Each group can be injected<br>
as described for groups C and D in part 1. Twenty-four hours after the in situ treatment<br>
the fractional rate of protein synthesis can be analyzed in both soleus muscles. Each<br>
muscle can be injected with a 0.9% saline solution (3.5 μl/100 g final body wt)<br>
containing 3H-phenylalanine (50 mM; 1 μCi/ml). Fifteen minutes later the middle two-<br>
thirds of the muscle can be excised and the muscle can be processed as described below.<br>
Processing of the Soleus Muscle—Part 2<br>
[00337]	The muscle can be first washed for  10 minutes in 0.84% saline<br>
containing 0.5 mM cycloheximide, to terminate protein synthesis, and 20 mM<br>
cycloleucine, to trap phenylalanine in the cell. The muscle can then be homogenized in<br>
2.5 mL of ice-cold 2% perchloric acid. The precipitated protein can be pelleted by<br>
centrifugation. One aliquot of the supernatant can be taken for liquid scintillation<br>
counting and another aliquot can be processed for conversion of phenylalanine to<br>
phenethylamine to determine the soluble phenylalanine concentration fluorometrically.<br>
See, e.g., Garlick, et al., Biochem. J., 1980, 192, 719. These values can provide the<br>
intracellular specific activity. The specific activity of phenylalanine in the muscle<br>
protein can be determined after hydrolyzing the protein by heating in 6N HCI. The<br>
amino acids released can be solubilized in buffer. One aliquot can be taken for<br>
scintillation counting and another for analysis of phenylalanine as for the supernatant<br>
fraction. The fractional rate of protein synthesis can be calculated as: protein specific<br>
activity/intracellular specific activity .times/time.<br>
Data Analysis—Part 2<br>
[00338]	Analyses of protein synthesis can be on a paired basis for each inhibitor.<br>
Student paired t test comparisons of the contralateral muscles can determine whether<br>
there is any effect of the inhibitor on protein synthesis. Protein breakdown can be<br>
calculated approximately as the fractional rate of protein synthesis (from part 2) plus the<br><br>
fractional rate of protein accretion (from part 1), where protein loss ylelds a negative<br>
value for protein accretion.<br>
[00339]	Qualitatively the ability of inhibitors to slow protein loss without<br>
affecting protein synthesis indicates a slowing of protein degradation.<br>

In vivo Investigation of Anti-Tumor Activity<br>
Materials<br>
[00340]	The proteasome inhibitors used for in vivo studies can be formulated in<br>
an appropriate medium for intravenous (iv) or oral (po) administration. For example, for<br>
the iv administration the compounds can be administered dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, or in<br>
mixtures of 0.9% NaCl, solutol HS15 and dimethylsulfoxide, for example in the ratio<br>
87:10:3 (v:v:v), respectively.<br>
Cell lines<br>
[00341]	The  following  human  and  murine tumor  cell   lines  of different<br>
histological origine can be used to test the antitumor activity of the compounds of the<br>
invention: H460 (human, lung), A2780 (human, ovary), PC-3 (human, prostate), LoVo<br>
(human, colon), HCT116 (human, colon), BXPC3 (human, pancreatic), PANC-1<br>
(human, pancreatic), MX-1 (human, mammary), MOLT (human, leukemia), multiple<br>
myeloma (human, myeloma), YC8 (murine, lymphoma), L1210 (murine, leukemia),<br>
3LL (murine, lung).<br>
Animal species<br>
[00342]	5-6 weeks immunocompetent or immunodeprived mice are purchased<br>
from commercial sources, for example from Harlan (Correzzana, Mi Italy). CD1 nu/nu<br>
mice are maintained under sterile conditions; sterilized cages, bedding, food and<br>
acidified water are used.<br>
Tumor cell implantation and growth<br>
[00343]	Solid tumor models of different hystorype (lung, ovary, breast, prostate,<br>
pancreatic, colon) can be transplanted subcutaneously (sc.) into the axillary region of<br>
immunocompetent mice (murine models) or in immunodeprived mice (human models).<br><br>
Human tumor cell lines, originally obtained from ATCC, can be adapted to grow "in<br>
vivo" as solid tumor from "in vitro culture".<br>
[00344]	Hematological human or murine tumor models can be transplanted into<br>
different sites (iv, ip , ic or sc) in immunocompetent mice (murine tumors) or in<br>
immunodeprived mice (human leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma models), according<br>
to their highest tumor take.<br>
Drug Treatment<br>
[00345]	Mice bearing solid (staged) or hematological tumors are randomized in<br>
experimental groups (10 mice/group). For solid tumors, an average tumor weight of 80-<br>
100 mg for each group is considered to start the treatment; mice with the smallest and<br>
largest tumors are discarded.<br>
[00346]	Experimental groups are randomly assigned to the drug treatment and to<br>
the control group. Animals can be treated iv or orally, depending on the oral<br>
bioavailability with the compounds following different treatment schedules: iv weekly<br>
or twice weekly, or by daily oral administration.<br>
[00347]	On solid tumor models, drug treatment can begin when the tumor size<br>
ranges between 80-100 mg after tumor transplantation (Day 0).<br>
[00348]	The compounds can be administered in a volume of 10 mL/Kg body<br>
weight/mouse in the appropriate solvent.<br>
Parameters of antitumor activity<br>
[00349]	The following parameters can be assessed for the evaluation of the<br>
antitumor activity:<br>
-	growth of primary solid tumor; in each mouse is monitored by caliper<br>
measurement twice weekly;<br>
-	survival time of treated mice as compared to control mice<br>
-	twice weekly body weight evaluation of individual mice.<br>
[00350]	The tumor growth inhibition, TWI% (percentage of primary tumor<br>
growth inhibition in comparison with vehicle treated control groups) or the Relative<br>
tumor growth inhibition, RTWI% in case of staged tumors, is evaluated one week after<br>
the last drug treatment and the Tumor weight (TW) can be calculated as follows:<br><br><br>
where a and b are long and short diameters of the tumor mass in mm.<br>
[00351]	The antitumor activity can be determined as tumor weight inhibition<br>
(TWI %), which is calculated according to the formula:<br><br>
[00352] The RTWI% (relative percentage of primary tumor growth inhibition in<br>
comparison with vehicle treated control groups) is evaluated one week after the last drug<br>
treatment, according to the following formula:<br><br>
[00353]	The Percent of Tumor Regression can be calculated as regressions in<br>
terms of relative tumor weight, determined as tumor weight at given day divided by<br>
initial tumor weight at the outset the experiment.<br>
[00354]	On  haematological tumour models the  antitumor activity  can  be<br>
determined as percentage increase of the median survival time of mice expressed as the<br>
ratio (T/C%) of the median survival time of the treated group (T) to that of the control<br>
group (C). Animals which are tumour-free at the end of the experiment (60 days after<br>
transplantation) are excluded from the calculation and considered as long term survivors<br>
(LTS).<br><br>
Evaluation of toxicity in tumor bearing mice<br>
[00355]	Toxicity can be evaluated daily on the basis of the gross autopsy findings<br>
and the weight loss. Mice are considered to have died of toxicity when death occurs<br>
before the death of vehicle treated control animals, or when significant body weight loss<br>
(&gt; 20%), and/or spleen and liver size reduction are observed.<br>
[00356]	The BWC% (Body weight change %) is assessed as follow : 100- (mean<br>
body weight of mice at given day/mean body weight at start of treatment) x 100. This<br>
value is determined one week after the last treatment with the test compound.<br>
Example K<br>
In vitro Viability of Cells<br>
[00357]	The IC50 values measuring in vitro viability of cells in the presence of<br>
test compounds can be determined according to the following procedure. Cells can be<br>
seeded in 96-well plates at varylng densities and then assayed using the Calcein-AM<br>
viability assay after 24 hours to determine the optimal final density for each cell type.<br>
Cells can then be seeded in 96-well plates at the determined density in 100 ΜL of an<br>
appropriate cell media known to one skilled in the art.<br>
[00358]	Serial dilutions of test compounds can be made so that the concentrations<br>
are twice the desired concentration to be evaluated. When 100 μL of the dilution is then<br>
added to the cells plated in 100 μL of media, a final concentration of, for example, 0,<br>
11.7, 46.9, 187.5, 375, and 750 nM can be obtained. Compounds can be added to the<br>
plates three to four hours after seeding the cells, then the plates can be incubated at 37<br>
°C for the desired time point (e.g., one, two, or three days).<br>
[00359]	Calcein-AM viability assays can be conducted at the desired time points<br>
as follows. Media can be aspirated using a manifold and metal plate to leave<br>
approximately 50 μL/well. The wells can be washed three times with 200 μL DPBS,<br>
aspirating each time with the manifold to leave 50 μL/well. A 8 μM solution of Calcein-<br>
AM in DPBS can be prepared and 150 μL can be added to each well. The plates can<br>
then be incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes. After incubation, calcein can be aspirated<br>
with the manifold and cells can be washed with 200 μL DPBS as before. After final<br>
aspiration, fluorescence can be measured using a Cytofluor 2300 fluorescence plate<br><br>
reader. Negative controls can contain media and no cells, and experiments can be<br>
conducted in triplicate.<br>

Kinetic Experiments in vitro<br>
[00360]	Compounds of the invention can be tested for proteasome inhibitory<br>
activity using a protocol described in Rock, et al., Cell, 1994, 78, 761. According to this<br>
procedure, dissociation constants (Ki) for the equilibrium established when proteasome<br>
and test compound interact to form a complex. The reactions can be carried out using<br>
SDS-activated 20S proteasome from rabbit muscle, and the proteasome substrate can be<br>
Suc-LLVY-AMC.<br>

Inhibition of Activation of NF-KB<br>
[00361]	Compounds of the invention can be tested for inhibiting the activity of<br>
NF-KB by carrylng out the assay described in Palombella, et al., Cell, 1994, 78, 773).<br>
For example, MG63 osteocarcinoma cells can be stimulated by treatment with TNF-α<br>
for   designated  times.   Whole  cell   extracts   can   be  prepared   and   analyzed   by<br>
electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the PRDII probe from the human IFN-β gene<br>
promoter.<br>

Compound Activity<br>
[00362]	Using the assays of Example C and Example E above the following<br>
Table F-l demonstrates the utility of compounds of the invention for proteasome<br>
inhibition. In the following Tables, for the inhibition of HEP, Example C, compounds of<br>
the present invention with a "+" are less than 1000 nM; compounds of the present<br>
invention with a "++" are less than 100 nM; and compounds of the present invention<br>

Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms<br>
[00363]	When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of Formula (I) can<br>
be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be<br>
administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal, and can be prepared in a manner well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical art.<br>
[00364]	This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain,<br>
as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of Formula (I) above in<br>
combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the<br>
compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient,<br>
diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a<br>
capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can<br>
be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for<br>
the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills,<br>
powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups,<br>
aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to<br>
10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories,<br>
sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.<br>
[00365]	In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide<br>
the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active<br>
compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200<br>
mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be<br>
adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation,<br>
e.g. about 40 mesh.<br>
[00366]	Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth,<br>
gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystaliine cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose,<br>
water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include:<br>
lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents;<br><br>
emulsifylng and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and<br>
propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of<br>
the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of<br>
the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employlng procedures known<br>
in the art.<br>
[00367]	The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage<br>
containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the<br>
active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units<br>
suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing<br>
a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic<br>
effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
[00368]	The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is<br>
generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood,<br>
however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be<br>
determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the<br>
condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound<br>
administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the<br>
patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
[00369]	For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active<br>
ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention.<br>
When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active<br>
ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as<br>
tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage<br>
forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of<br>
the active ingredient of the present invention.<br>
[00370]	The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For<br>
example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component,<br>
the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be<br>
separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and<br>
permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release.<br><br>
A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such<br>
materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
[00371]	The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the<br>
present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include<br>
aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored<br>
emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil,<br>
as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
[00372]	Compositions for  inhalation  or  insufflation  include  solutions  and<br>
suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures<br>
thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the<br>
compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic<br>
effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may<br>
be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached<br>
to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,<br>
suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices<br>
which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>
[00373]	The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will<br>
vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such<br>
as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the<br>
like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already<br>
suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the<br>
symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this<br>
is referred to as "therapeutically effective amount." Effective doses will depend on the<br>
disease condition being treated as well as by the judgement of the attending clinician<br>
depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general<br>
condition of the patient, and the like.<br>
[00374]	The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by<br>
conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can<br>
be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined<br>
with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound<br><br><br>
preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most<br>
preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing<br>
excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
[00375]	The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can<br>
vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the<br>
manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and<br>
the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a<br>
compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a<br>
number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and<br>
the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be<br>
provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10%<br>
w/v of the compound for parenteral adminstration. Some typical dose ranges are from<br>
about 1 ng/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose<br>
range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage<br>
is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease<br>
or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological<br>
efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of<br>
administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived<br>
from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
[00376]	The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for<br>
example, in the treatment or prevention of inflammatory diseases, which comprise one<br>
or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I). Such kits can further<br>
include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components,<br>
such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers,<br>
additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be<br>
administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the<br>
components, can also be included in the kit.<br>
[00377]	Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described<br>
herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such<br>
modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Each<br><br>
reference   cited   in  the  present  application,   including  patents,   published   patent<br>
applications, and journal articles, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
A method of therapeutic, prophylactic, diagnostic or other treatment of human being or<br>
animal is excluded from the scope of appended claims.<br><br>
