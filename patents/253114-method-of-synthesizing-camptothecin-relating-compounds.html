The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for synthesizing camptothecinrelated compound(s) . More particularly, the invention relates to a process for preparing intermediates related to the synthesis of camptothecin analogs having an anti-tumor activity and use of said intermediates, and relates to a total synthesis of camptothecin analogs.<br>
Background Art<br>
Camptothecin (hereinafter described as CPT) isolated from the bark, root, fruit, leaf and the like of Camtotheca acunimta o f Chinese origin is a pentacyclic alkaloid and is known to show the anti-tumor activity by inhibition of a nucleic acid synthesis. In the meantime, as to a camptothecin derivative the induction of diarrhea and the likeasasideeffectarereported (Gann to Kagaku Ryohou 17, pll5-120. 1990) , leaving a problem to cause disorder for the gastrointestinal tract, and therefore, various kinds of derivatives have been examined to reduce the toxicity, to increase the effect, and so on.<br>
Thus, the inventors already reported 7-e thyl-1.0-[ 4-( 1-piper idino)-1-piper idino ]  carbonyloxy camptothecin hydrochloride trihydrate (hereinafter described as CPT-11), the water soluble semisynthetic derivative of CPT, as a compound which is reduce in toxicity compared to CPT, and it is at present widely used as the anti-tumor agent (general name; irinotecan hydrochloride).<br>
Camptothecin analogs such as CPT-11 can be derived by a chemical modification of CPT obtained from natural materials.<br>
However, owing to an extremely low amount of CPT obtained from<br>
2<br><br>
natural materials such as Camtotheca acunimtati h ich is thestartingmaterial , it is anticipated that according to an increased demand of CPT-11 which is a useful derivative and the like, a sufficient supply of CPT becomes difficult notwithstanding a measure for the starting material supply such as afforestation. Although the total synthesis is also examined, it is the present situation that it has not yet been into practical use.<br>
As a process by total synthesis is known the method of Shen. W. et al. represented by the below reaction scheme via Friedlander reaction of the aminopropiophenone and the tricyclic ketone (J. Org. Chem. 1993. 58, 611-617 "Concise Total Syntheses of dl-Camptothecin and Related Anticancer Drugs.", though there are problems that the steps are tedious, the yields are not sufficient and only the racememate is synthesized.<br><br>

In the meantime, although Curran, D.

this method is highly dangerous due to the necessity to use t-BuLi easily flammable in a large amount industrially, and the reaction at -78°Casa reaction temperature is required, making it impossible to enlarge the batch size. Further, owing to the necessity of a complicated temperature control in the total reaction system it was not an industrially practical reaction system.<br>
