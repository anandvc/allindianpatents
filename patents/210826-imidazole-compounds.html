1,        Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to-a method of treating glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure and other diseases with substantially reduced cardiovascular or sedative side effects by administering to mammals including humans, compounds which are selective agonists of the cx2B alone or  2B and  2C adrenergic receptor subtypes and which lack substantial activity at the a2A receptor subtype. The present invention is also directed to novel compounds and pharmaceutical compositions adapted for administering said compounds to mammals/ including humans.<br>
2,         Brief Description of the Prior Art<br>
Compounds which have adrenergic activity are well known in the art, and are described in numerous United States and foreign patents and in scientific publications. It is generally known and accepted in the art that adrenergic activity is useful for treating animals of the mammalian species, including humans, for curing or alleviating the symptoms and conditions of numerous diseases and conditions. In other words, it is generally accepted in the art that pharmaceutical compositions having an adrenergic compound or compounds as the active ingredient are useful for treating glaucoma, chronic pain, nasal congestion, high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and inducing anesthesia.<br>
The two main families of adrenergic receptor are termed alpha adrenergic receptors and beta adrenergic receptors in the art, and each of these two families is known to have subtypes, which are designated by<br><br>
2<br>
letters of the alphabet, such as  2A,  2B. See the article by Bylund et al, Pharmacol Rev. 46, pp. 121-136(1994).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has been discovered in accordance with the present invention that adrenergic compounds which act selectively, and preferably even specifically as agonists of the  2B or  2B /  2C (hereinafter referred to as a2B or a2B/2C) receptor subtypes in preference over the  2A receptor   . subtype, possess desirable therapeutic properties associated with adrenergics but without having one or more undesirable side effects such as changes in blood pressure or sedation. For the purposes of the present invention, a compound is defined to be a specific or at least selective agonist of the  c2B or  2B/2C receptor subtype(s) if the compound is at least approximately ten times more potent as an agonist at either the a2B and ct2C or both receptor subtypes than at the  2A receptor subtype, or if the difference in the compound's efficacy at the ct2B and a2B/2C receptor relative to the <x2a receptor is greater than and its efficacy at the a2a></x2a>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods of treating animals of the mammalian species, including humans, with a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more specific or selective a2B or a2B/2C adrenergic agonist compounds as the active ingredient, for treatment of the many diseases or conditions against which alpha adrenergic compounds are useful, including without limitation glaucoma, reducing elevated intraocular pressure, chronic pain, diarrhea, and nasal congestion. In addition, the compounds of this invention are useful for<br><br>
3<br>
treating muscle spasticity including hyperactive micturition, diarrhea, diuresis, withdrawal syndromes, pain including neuropathic pain., neurodegenerative diseases including optic neuropathy, spinal ischemia and stroke, memory and cognition deficits, attention deficit disorder, psychoses including manic disorders, anxiety, depression, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemia and nasal congestion.<br>
The present invention is also directed to the pharmaceutical compositions used in the above-noted methods of treatment.<br>
The present invention particularly covers methods for treating diseases and conditions where adrenergic compounds are effective for treatment, but their use is limited because of their generally known side effects.<br>
Accordingly, the present    inveniion provides imidazole compounds selected<br>
from the group consisting of:<br><br><br>
3A<br>
wherein each X,is independently 1 or 2,<br>
Rt is independently selected from the group consisting of H; halogen; CM aikyl; C1-4 alkenyl; C1-4 alkynyl; -COIL&gt; where R., is H, CM alky I or CM alkoxy; Cs-a cyoloalkyl; aryl; cyano; nitro; trihalomethyl; oxo; or-(CH2),, -X-(CH;),,, ~(R:;)o - where X is O, S or N, n is 0-3, tv. is 0-3, o is 0-1, and R5 is methyl or H,j. each Re, is independent selected from the group consisting of H; halogen: CM alky!: CM alkenyl; CM alkynyl;-COR4 where RA is H, CM alky] or CM alkoxy; C3-r, cycloalkyl; aryJ; cyano; nitro; trihalomethyl and oxo wherein each p is independently 1 or 2 and Y is - (CfRjXh -, wherein R7 is independently defined identicaliy to R] and z is independently 1 or 2, said compound further having selective agonist activity at the a2B or a2B/a2C adrenevgic receptor subl)-pe(s) over the ct2A adrenergic receptor subtype, and all pharmacologically acceptable salts, esters.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds which are used in the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treaiment of the present invention are selective or specific agonists of the cs2B or a2B/2C adrenergic receptor subtypes, in preference over the a2A receptor subtype. In accordance with the present invention/ a compound is considered a selective ct2B or a2B/2C agonist if that compound's difference in efficacy as an agonist of the a2B or O.2B/2C receptor subtype(s) compared fo the a2A receptor subtype is greater than  . 0.3 and its efficacy at the a2A receptor subtype is 
 <br>
4<br>
act as an agonist of the a2A receptor subtype to any measurable or biologically significant extent.<br>
A set of agents has been discovered that are functionally selective for the a2B or a2B/2C - subtypes of said adrenergic receptors. This preferential activity can be determined in a variety of functional assays such as Cyclic AMP Production, Shimizu et al, /. Neurochem. 16, pp. 1609-1619 (1969); R-SAT (Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology), Messier et al, Pharmacol. Toxicol. 76, pp. 308-311(1995) and the Cytosensor microphysiometer, Neve et al, /. Biol. Chem. 267, pp. 25748-25753, (1992) using cells that naturally express individual subtypes or have had one of the subtypes introduced. The cells or recombinant receptors used should be human or from a species that has been shown to have a similar pharmacology. In the study below, the RSAT assay on cells that have been transiently transfected with the human ct2A (clO gene), rat a2B (RNG gene) and human a2C (c4 gene) receptors was used. The rat a2B receptor has been shown to have a pharmacology that corresponds to the human oc2B receptor (see, for example, Bylund et al., Pharmocol, Rev. 46, pp. 127-129(1994)).<br>
In the treatment of glaucoma, particularly, topical administration may be used. Any common topical formulation such as a solution, suspension, gel, ointment, or salve and the like may be applied to the eye in glaucoma and dermally to treat other indications. Preparation of such topical formulations are well described in the art of pharmaceutical formulations as exemplified, for example, by Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, Edition 17, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania.<br><br>
5<br>
If the drug is to be administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like or as a syrup or elixir for oral administration. For intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal or epidural administration, the compound will be prepared as a solution or suspension capable of being administered by injection. In certain cases, it may be useful to formulate these compounds in suppository or as an extended release formulation, including the dermal patch form, for deposit on or under the skin or for intramuscular injection.<br>
Treatment of glaucoma or any other indications known or discovered to be susceptible to treatment by adrenergic compounds will be effected by administration of therapeutically effective dose of one or more compounds in accordance with the instant invention. A therapeutic concentration will be that concentration which effects reduction of the particular condition, or retards its expansion. In certain instances, the drug potentially could be used in a prophylactic manner to prevent onset of a particular condition. A given therapeutic concentration will vary from condition to condition and in certain instances may vary with the severity of the condition being treated and the patient's susceptibility to treatment. Accordingly, a given therapeutic concentration will be best determined at the time and place through routine experimentation. However, it is anticipated that in the treatment of, for example, glaucoma, that a formulation containing between 0.001 and 5 percent by weight, preferably about 0.01 to3% will usually constitute a therapeutically effective concentration. If administered systemically, an amount between 0.001 and 50 mg per kg, preferably between 0.001 and 10 mg per kg body weight per<br><br>
6<br>
day, but most preferably about 0.01 to 1.0 ing/kg, will effect a therapeutic result in most instances.<br>
Because the  2B and  2B/2C specific selective agonist compounds lack substantial  2A side effects, treatments of diseases or conditions with such compounds in accordance with the present invention is advantageous, particularly when the treatment is directed to a human having cardiovascular problems.<br>

Example A<br>
5     Synthesis of 1 -dimethyl suIfamoyl-2-t-butyldimethylsily 1-5-imidazolecarboxaldehyde:<br><br>
Procedure -<br>
Imidazole (1) (20.0g, 0.29 mol), triethylamine (41.0ml:, 0.29 mol) and N,N-dimethylsulfamoyl chloride (31.6mL, 0.29 mol) were added to 320mL of benzene. The reaction was stirred for 48h at room temperature (rt) and then filtered. The filtrate was collected and concentrated under reduced pressure. Vacuum distillation of the crude product (~0.5 nraiHg, 115°-HS^C) afforded 38.7g (76%) of a clear and colorless oil. Upon cooling the product solidifies to give white crystals (2). l-(Dimethylsulfamoyl) imidazole (2) (18.8g, 0.11 mol) was added to 430mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). The solution was cooled to -78° C. A solution of n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) in hexane (1.6M, 70.9 mL, 0.11 mol) was added dropwise to the<br><br>
16<br>
reaction flask. Upon completion, the reaction was stirred for th at -78°C. t-Butyldimethylsilylchloride (17.8g, 0.12 mol) in 50mL of THF was added via cannula to the reaction. After the addition was completed the reaction mixture was warmed slowly to rt and then stirred for 24h . The reaction was diluted with water and the organic layer separated. The organic phase was washed with brine and then dried over sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure. Column chromatography (20% ethyl acetate/ hexane as eluant) afforded a light yellow solid. Recrystallization from pentane gave 30g (94%) of white crystals (3).<br>
l-Dimethylsulfamoyl-2-t-butyldimethylsilyl imidazole (3) (5.0g, 17.3 mmol) was added to lOOmL of THF. The solution was cooled to -20°C A solution of secondary butyl lithium (s-BuLi) in hexane (1.3M, 14.6mL, 19 mmol) was added dropwise to the reaction flask. Upon completion the reaction was stirred for lh at -20°C. 8 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) was added to the reaction and then stirred at rt for 3.5h. The reaction was diluted with water and the organic layer separated. The organic phase was washed with brine and then dried over sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure. Column chromatography (20% ethyl acetate/ hexane) afforded a light yellow oil. Upon cooling the product solidifies to give yellow crystals of l-dimethylsulfamoyl-2-t-butyldimethylsilyl-5- imidazolecarboxaldehyde (4).<br>
Example B-l<br>
Procedure for Preparation of 4(5)-(7-methoxy-l,2,34-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl)-lH-imidazole, hydrogen chloride salt:<br><br><br>
17<br>
Procedure -<br>
7-Methoxy-l-tetralone (1) (1.5g, 8.5 mmol) and 1-dimethylsulfamoyl-2-t-butyldimethyIsilyl-5- imidazolecarboxaldehyde (2) (2.7g, 8.5 mmol) were added to 8.5 mL of a 40% solution of sulfuric acid. The reaction was heated for 24h at 90°C After cooling to rt, the reaction was made basic with excess concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The mixture was extracted twice with THF. The organic layers were combined and washed with brine. The organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 2.7g of a yellow solid (3) comprising 3-(3H-imidazole-<br><br>
18<br>
4(5)ylmethylene)-7-methoxy chroman-4-one. The crude product was suspended in lOOmL of ethanol and a palladium on carbon catalyst (10%, 0.27g) added.

Example O<br>
Procedure for Preparation of 4(5)-octahydro pentalen-2-ylmethyI)-lH-5      imidazole, hydrochloride:<br><br>
Procedure-<br>
A.       Following the synthesis of White and Whitesell, Synthesis pp. 602-3 (1975), ether (10 ml) was added to a flame-dried flask cooled to 0°C and then kept under an argon atmosphere. Then n-butyl lithium (35 mL of 2.5 M solution in hexane, 2.2 equiv.) was added and subsequently diisopropyl amine (14 mL, 2.5 equiv.) was added slowly and the mixture was allowed to stir for 30 min. at 0°C. To this generated solution of lithium diisopropyl amide was added cyclooctene oxide (5.0 g, 1.0 equiv.). The mixture was<br><br>
55<br>
stirred at rt for one day and then heated to reflux under argon atmosphere for 2 days. The reaction was quenched by addition of NH4CI. The solution was extracted with THF/EtOAc. The organic extracts were combined, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford a yellow brown oil which was the 1-hydroxy-octahydropentalene. The compound was used without further purification in the next step.<br>
B.	The alcohol thus obtained (5.0 g, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in<br>
dichloromethane (200 ml) and to this solution was added pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate (13 g, 1.5 equiv.) and the mixture was stirred at rt for one<br>
day. The solution was then filtered through a short column of SiC&gt;2 using<br>
diethyl ether as eluent. The obtained solution was concentrated in vacuo to<br>
afford a pale green-yellow oil which was used without further purification<br>
in the next step.<br>
C.	The octahydro-pentalen-l-one (5.0 g, 1.0 equiv.) of the above step<br>
was added to 4(5)-imidazolecarboxaldehyde (3.8 g, 1.0 equiv.) and 40%<br>
H2SO4 (20 ml) and the mixture was maintained at 90°C for 3 days. The<br>
reaction was then quenched by addition of ammonium hydroxide and<br>
extracted with tetrahydrofuran/ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were<br>
combined, washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate. The resulting<br>
aqueous layer was neutralized with HC1/ NH4CI. The aqueous layer was<br>
re-extracted as above and the combined organic fractions were<br>
concentrated in vacuo to afford an orange solid.<br>
D.	This orange solid was dissolved in ethanol to which palladium on<br>
carbon (0.5 g) was added. The reaction flask was placed under 40 psi of<br>
hydrogen for one day. The reaction solution was filtered though celite with<br><br>
56<br>
more ethanol used as eluent. The solution was concentrated in vacuo to afford a yellow brown oil. Purification by column chromatography using 17:1 chloroform/ methanol afforded the ketone product in a somewhat impure state.<br>
E.        The ketone functionality was then removed by addition of the product of the step above (8.2 g, 1.0 equiv.) to diethylene glycol (80 mL)and hydrazine hydrate (13.0 g, 1.0 equiv.). This mixture was stirred overnight and then potassium hydroxide (11.0 g, 5.0 equiv.) was added and the solution was heated under reflux for one day. The reaction solution was cooled to rt and washed with water. The solution was extracted with THF/EtOAc and the combined fractions were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford a yellow oil. The monohyrdochloride salt was made by dissolving this oil in anhydrous ethanol saturated with HC1 and heating.<br><br>

Procedure:<br>
A.	3,4-lutidine (21.4g, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in 200 mL of water at 20°C and<br>
potassium permanganate was added in 6.32g portions twice daily for 5 days (total<br>
63.2g, 2 equiv.). After 5 days the solution was stored in the freezer, then thawed<br>
and filtered through celite. The resulting colorless solution was concentrated at<br>
90°C on a rotary evaporator until a white solid was obtained. This solid was<br>
recrystallized from 5N HC1 to give 9.56g of white crystals. NMR indicated a<br>
mixture of two regioisomers with the desired isomer being the major product.<br>
B.	These crystals were heated in anhydrous ethanol saturated with HC1 gas under<br>
argon and at reflux for 6 h. Then ethanol was removed from the solution by rotary<br>
evaporation and the residue was taken up in 100 mL of water and the pH was<br>
adjusted to between 7 and 8 with solid sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous phase was<br>
extracted with diethyl ether (3X) and the combined organic fractions were washed<br>
with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate and then filtered and concentrated to give<br>
a colorless oil (3.56g, 10.8% yield).<br>
C.	Diisopropylamine 2.84g, 1.3 equiv.) was added to n-BuLi (11.21 mL, 1.3<br>
equiv.) in 100 mL of anhydrous THF under argon at -78°C via syringe to produce<br>
lithium diisopropylamide in situ. To this solution was added the product of B above<br>
(3.56g, 1 equiv.) in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran, via syringe and the mixture was<br>
stirred at -78°C for 20 min. At this point methyl acrylate (4.85 mL 2.5 equiv.) in 20<br>
mL of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise through a cannula. The solution was<br>
stirred another 2 h before quenching by addition of 40 mL of 10% potassium<br>
acetate. The solution was allowed to warm to 20°C and then was concentrated on a<br>
rotary evaporator. The aqueous residue was extracted three times with chloroform.<br>
The combined fractions were washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate,<br>
filtered and concentrated to a black solid, which was stored under high vacuum.<br><br>
59<br>
Chromatography on silica gel with hexanes / ethyl acetate (7/3 -&gt; 6/4) afforded 2.41g (58.2%) of the desired product which was used without further purification in the next step.<br>
D.	The material from Step C (0.48g, 1 equiv.) was dissolved in 1 mL of 6M HC1<br>
and heated at 105°C for 16 h after which time the solution was concentrated to a<br>
solid by rotary evaporation at 80°C. The residue was taken up in 2 mL of water and<br>
neutralized with solid sodium bicarbonate. The neutralized solution was extracted<br>
with chloroform (3X) and the combined fractions were washed with brine, dried<br>
over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a colorless oil. (0.456g 93.4%).<br>
E.	The isoquinolone (1.91 g, 1 equiv.) obtained in step D above was heated with<br>
4(5)-imidazolecarboxaldehyde 1.25g, 1. equiv.) at 110°C in 15 mL of 40% sulfiiric<br>
acid for 30 h. The reaction mixture was stored for several days at 0° C under argon.<br>
The solution was then diluted with 20 mL of water and basified to pH 8.9 with<br>
NH4OH. Solids were collected by filtration and dried with high vacuum. The<br>
product was a yellow solid (2.81g, 96.1%) comprising a mixture of both positional<br>
isomers at the exo double bond.<br>
F.	The product of E, above, was dissolved in 150 mL of methanol and to this<br>
solution Pd/C (.412g, 0.15 wt. equiv.) was added. The methanolic solution was then<br>
saturated with H2 by repeated evacuations and H2back-fUl iterations. The solution<br>
was stirred under 1 atm. pressure of H2 for 20 h until TLC revealed that no<br>
unsaturated starting material remained. The solution was filtered through celite and<br>
concentrated to an oil. Chromatography on silica using dichloromethane and<br>
methanol (9/1) recovered pure product (1.853g 6504 %) as a white foam. This was<br>
taken up in methanol to which fumaric acid (0.4817g, 1.5 equiv.) was added with<br>
warming to dissolve the solids. The solution was cooled slowly and off-white<br>
crystals (0.826g, 74%) were obtained, which are represented as the compound P-l.<br><br>

62<br>
Procedure:<br>
A.        The reactive azido reagent of the first step was generated in situ by addition of iodine monochloride (67.6 g, 1.15 equiv.) in 50 mL of acetonitrile dropwise through a dropping funnel to a stirred slurry of sodium azide (58.84 g, 2.5 equiv.) in 350 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile at -10°C and under argon. Addition was complete in 30 min, the mixture was stirred an additional 30 min and cyclohexenone (34.81 g, 1.0 equiv.) was added via a syringe and then stirred at 20°C for an additional 20 h. The mixture was then poured into a liter of water and extracted with three 200 mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined fractions were washed with 5% sodium thiosulfate solution and then brine. The organic phase was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacuo at 20°C. The residues were taken up in 1 L of DMSO at 0°C and a second portion of NaN3 was added and the mixture stirred while warming to ambient temperature. This mixture was then diluted with 2.5 L of ice water and extracted ten times with dichloro-methane (10 X 250 mL). The combined organic fractions were concentrated on a rotovap to a volume of ~1 L and this concentrate was extracted three times with 250 mL of water, and then brine, and then dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a dark oil (39.5 g) and stored at -40°C.<br>
The oil was purified by chromatography on silica using 9/1 to 8/2 hexane:ethyl acetate. Two isomers were recovered, the first with the azido group a to the ketone function was obtained in 13.22 g, 26.6%, yield. The p-isomer was obtained in 15.825 g3 32.0%, yield.<br>
B.        Triphenyl phosphine was dissolved in 20 mL of dichloromethane and placed under an argon atmosphere at 20 °C. The (i-isomer obtained as described above was added via cannual to the stirred solution and maintained at 20°C for 2 h. As the reaction progressed nitrogen was liberated from the solution, and after 2 h TLC demonstrated there was no starting material remaining. The solution was<br><br>
63<br>
concentrated and passed through a silica gel column with dichloromethane progressing to 95/5 dichloromethane:methanol as eluent. The amidophosphonate intermediate was obtained in 2.139 g, 65.1%, yield.<br>
C.        The amidophosphonate was dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous o-xylene and then 10% Pd / C was added with stirring. Freshly distilled acrolein was then added to the mixture via syringe and heated to reflux for 4 h, after which time the remaining acrolein was added and heating under reflux was continued for 44 h under a finger condenser and under argon. At that time TLC indicated some intermediate remained, so 0.5g addition Pd/ C was added and the mixture again was heated to reflux for another 8 h. The mixture was cooled to rt, filtered and concentrated on a rotovap to eliminate excess acrolein, until about 100 mL of o-xylene solution remained. This solution was cooled by addition of ice, and was extracted three times with IN HC1. The combined aqueous fractions were extracted 3X with Et2O. The aqueous phase was then cooled to 0°C and the pH was adjusted to -10 using concentrated NaOH. The aqueous was then extracted 5X with 100 mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform fractions were washed with water and then brined and dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and finally concentrated to give 3.51 g of an oil in 84.4% yield of 7,8-dihydro-6H-quinolin-5-one.<br>
D.	The 4(5)-imidazole carboxaldehyde was condensed with the quinolinone as<br>
described in Step E of Example P and was obtained both Q-l and Q-2.<br>

described in Step F of Example P above to yield two products which were<br>
separated by chromatography to give Q-3 and A.<br>
F.	The keto group was removed by the same hydrazine reduction procedure as<br>
that described in Step E of Example O above to give Q4.<br><br>

A mixture of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoxaline (23.75g, 1 equiv.), benzaldehyde (19.81 mL, 1.1 equiv.) and acetic anhydride (33.4 mL, 2.0 equiv.) was stirred at 150°C under argon for 15 hr, after which time TLC indicated mostly desired product with some starting materials remaining. Starting materials were removed by vacuum distillation using a Vigreux column at 170°C. The pot residue was then subjected to Kugelrohr distillation from 170 - 220°C. The first fraction was slightly contaminated with starting materials (4.71g). A second fraction was pure (18.93g). After applying high vacuum to the first fraction it crystallized. Combined fractions yielded 20.1 Ig, 51%.<br><br>
65<br>
B.        The product from A, above, was dissolved in 100 mL of methanol and warmed slightly, then cooled to -35 to -40°C and ozone was bubbled through the solution. After a few minutes the starting material began to crystallize out of solution and the solution was warmed and another 200 mL of methanol was added and then the reaction was resumed. After about 30 minutes the solution turned pale blue. Nitrogen was then introduced by bubbling through the solution for 30 minutes, then methyl sulfide (3.5 mL) was injected into the solution, whereafter the solution was stirred for another 30 min. at -35°C, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature with stirring. After about 48 hr. at 20°C the mixture was steam distilled to remove solvents to provide a residue of 8.4g of a yellow-brown oil. This residue was taken up in diethyl ether and extracted 3x with 25 mL portions of IN HC1. The combined aqueous fractions were washed with diethyl ether 3x. The aqueous solution was gradually basified to a pH of 8 with concentrated NaOH. The free amine was then extracted from the aqueous phase with chloroform (3x). The combined chloroform extracts were washed twice with brine, dried of MgSO4 and concentrated to a yellow oil (3.01g) After keeping under high vacuum for 1 hr., 2.97g remained. This was recrystallized from diethyl ether to give 2.35g of a bright yellow solid. Yield 67.5%.<br>

(Aldrich Chemicals) were suspended in 75 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at 20°C under argon followed by addition of piperidine followed by acetic acid. The mixture was stirred 16 h at 20°C. After 20 h, no traces of the quinoxalone remained as indicated by TLC. The solids were collected by filtration and washed with a small amount of tetrahydrofuran, followed by chloroform. The solid was dried under high vacuum to give 6.85g of R-l. Yield 90.3%.<br><br>

The crude product (7.96 g) from the step above was subjected to ozonolysis as described in Step B above. After work-up and chromatography there was obtained 5.18 g of a pale oil. Yield; 97.8% assuming pure starting material. The resulting 7,8-dihydro-6H-isoquinolin-5-one (1.692 g, 1 equiv.) was condensed with 4(5 )-imidazolecarboxal deny de as described in Step C above to yield 2.23 g of the unsaturated compound analogous to R-l in the scheme above in 92.8% yield. This product was treated with palladium on carbon as described in Step F of Example P to reduce the exo double bond to produce 6-(3H-imidazol-4(5)-ylrnethyl)-7,8-dihydro-6H-isoquinolin-5-one (R-2) in 52%. The ketone above was reduced using hydrazine and converted to the fumarate salt as detailed in Example P, Step F. Yield for the reduction: 62%. Yield of fumarate salt after recrystallization: 30.4% of 6-(3H-imida2ol-4(5)-yImethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline (R-3).<br>

Procedure -<br>
Methyl triphenylphosphonium bromide (2.75 g, 7.70 mmol) was suspended in 50 mL of dielhyl ether. At -10 °C, nBuLi (3.08 mL, 7.70 mmol, 2.5M soln in hexanes) was added. This mixture was stirred for 35 m before cooling to -70 °C. A solution of (/?)-(+)-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-4a-methyl-2(3//)-naphthalenone (1) (1.0 g, 6.09 mmol) in 15 mL of ether was added via syringe. This mixture was warmed to 0 °C over 30 m and the stirred at rt for another 30 m. The solution was washed with brine (2 x 20 mL) dried over MgSO4) filtered and the solvent was removed. Chromatography on SiO2 with hexanes gave 0.82 g (83%) of the diene 2 as a clear colorless oil.<br>
This hydroboration procedure follows that by Brown, H. C. et. ah J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969, 91, 2144. To a solution of the diene 2 (750 mg, 4.63 mmol) in 20 mL of THF was added 9-BBN (11.8 mL , 5.9 mmol, of a 0.5 M soln. in THF) at 0 °C. This was warmed to rt after 30 m and allowed to react at rt for 1 h. Dry MeOH (3.75 mL, 15.0 mmol as a 4.0 M soln in THF) was added to a stirred solution of LiAlH, (5.04 mL, 5.04 mmol, 1.0 M in ether) to form LiAlH(OMe)3. The borane was added to this alkoxy aluminum hydride via syringe. After 10 m at rt, carbon monoxide was bubbled through the solution for 20 m. Phosphate buffer (25 mL, pH 7.0 was added followed by H2O2 (10 mL, 30% soln) and this was stirred for 30 m. After a typical extraction process the oil was purified by chromatography on SiO3 with 5 to 10% EtOAc:Hx to yield the colorless aldehyde 3 as the major product 455 mg, (51%).<br>

After the ethanol was removed heating was continued at 145 °C for 1 h. The triethyl orthoacetate was removed by simple distillation. After the residue cooled to rt the product was purified by chromatography on SiO2 with 5% ether:Hx to give ester 3 as a clear colorless oil 1.08g (-31 %).<br>
A solution of the above ethyl ester 3 (1.0 g, 5.9 mmol) was dissolved in hexanes (50 mL) and cooled to -78 °C. A solution of DIBAL (5.8 mL 1.0 M in cyclohexane) was added dropwise. After 15 m, diethyl ether (50 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred with Rochelle's salt solution (25 mL) for 10 m. The organic layer was separated, dried and filtered. Chromatography on SiO2 with 7% Et2O:Hx delivered the aldehyde as a clear colorless oil, 0.52g (74%). The aldehyde 4 was subjected to the Biichi protocol as described above.

Kugelrohr distillation of the resulting residue at 150°C and 0.5 torr gave 14.11 g (70%) of cyclohexene ester 1 as an oil in the 20°C bulb. To a solution of the ester 1 (13.62 g, 72.32 mmol) in anhydrous THF (200 ml) at -78°C under argon added the LiAlH4 (54.30 ml, 1 M in diethyl ether). This mixture was stirred for 1 h at 20°C and then quenched at 0°C by the careful, consecutive addition of H2O (2.06 ml), NaOH (2.06 ml of a 15% aqueous solution), and an additional portion of H2O (6.18 ml). The solids were filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Kugelrohr distillation of the resulting residue at 15O-18O°C and 0.5 torr gave 9.98 g (98%) of the alcohol 2 as a colorless volatile oil in the 0°C bulb. To a solution of triphenyl phosphine (27.13 g, 103.45 mmol), and imidazole (7.04g, 103.45 mmol) in anhydrous benzene (450 ml) under argon was added the I2 (22.75 g, 89.61 mmol) in benzene (170 ml) over a period of 10 minutes with rapid mechanical stirring. After an additional 10 minutes the alcohol 2 (9.23 g, 65.89 mmol) in benzene (100 ml) was added to this rapidly stirring mixture over a period of 5 minutes. After 2 h the reaction was diluted with hexanes (800 ml) and the solids were filtered off. The organics were washed with 3 portions of H2O (800 ml), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual solids were filtered off and the resulting oil was purified by kugelrohr distillation at 200°C and 0.5 torr to give 11.99 g (73%) of the iodide 3 as a pale oil in the 0°C bulb. To a solution of the previously described l-N-(dirnethylsulfamoyl)-2-tert-butyldimethylsilyl imidazole (4.34 g, 15.00 mmol) in anhydrous THF (50 ml) at -78°C under argon was added n-butyllithium (5.76 ml, 2.5 M in hexanes).

The residues were taken up in diethyl ether and washed consecutively with H2O and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Subsequent      purification by chromatography on SiO2 with 5-10% EtOAc:hexanes gave 0.89 g (15%) of the imidazole 4 as a pale oil. To a solution of imidazole 4 (0.89 g, 2.17 mmol) in anhydrous THF (25 ml) under argon was added tetrabutylammonium fluoride (2.38 ml, 1 M in THF) and the resultant solution was stirred for 1 h at 20°C. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues were i      taken up in diethyl ether and washed consecutively with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. The residues were purified by chromatography on SiO2 with 50% EtOAc:hexanes to give 0.56 g (87%) of the imidazole 5 as a pale oil. To a solution of 5 (0.53 g, 1.77 mmol) in MeOH (5 ml) was added aqueous KOH (15 ml of a 5M solution) and the mixture was heated at reflux for 32 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with H2O (5 ml) and extracted exhaustively with CHC13. The combined organic fractions were washed consecutively with H2O and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure.

Celite (5 g) was added to the reaction, the palladium was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 59.45 g (98%) of the saturated ester 2 which was carried on without further purification. To a solution of LiAlH4 (200.00 ml, 1 M in diethyl ether) at -78°C under argon was added the unsaturated ester 2 in anhydrous THF (400 ml) in a slow stream with vigorous mechanical stirring. Upon warming to 20°C additional THF (600 ml) was added and the reaction was stirred 1 h. The mixture was cooled to 0°C and quenched by the careful, consecutive addition of H2O (7.60 ml), NaOH (7.60 ml of a 15% aqueous solution), and an additional portion of H2O (22.80 ml). The solids were filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Subsequent purification by chromatography on SiOz with 20-50% EtOAc:hexanes gave 50.93 g (98%) of the alcohol 3 as a pale oil. To a solution of oxalyl chloride (20.65 ml, 41.29 mmol) in anhydrous CH2C12 (100 ml) at -78°C under argon was added dropwise a solution c-f DMSO (6.72 g, 86.02 mmol) in CH2C12 (25 ml).<br><br>

After mechanical stirring for 15 minutes a solution of the alcohol 3 (6.40 g, 34.41 mmol) in CH2C12 (80 ml) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred an additional 15 min at -78°C before adding triethylamine (27.85 g, 275.30 mmol). The reaction was stirred 2 h at 20°C and then quenched with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. This mixture was extracted CH2C12 and the combined organic fractions were washed consecutively with H2O and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting solids were purified by chromatography on SiO2 with 20-30% EtOAc:hexanes to give 5.08 g, (79%) of the aldehyde 4 as a white solid. A solution of aldehyde 4 (5.08 g, 27.59 mmol) in EtOH (40 ml) was treated with tosylmethyl isocyanide (TosMIC) (5.15 g, 26.27 mmol) and NaCN (0.13 g, 2.68 mmol) at 20°C for 3 h and then refrigerated. After 2 h refrigeration the solids were filtered off, dissolved in anhydrous MeOH saturated with NH3 (30 ml) and heated in a sealed tube at 100°C for 3.5 h. The reaction was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues were taken up in CHC13, washed consecutively with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated to a red oil. This residue was further purified by chromatography on SiO2 with 5-10% MeOH (saturated with NH3): CH2C12 to give 1.87 g (31%) of the imidazole 5 as a pink oil.

16 h. The solids were filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated at via kugelrohr at 100°C and 0.5 torr. The residues were taken up in CHC13 and washed consecutively with H2O and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Chromatography on SiO2 with 1-5% MeOH:CH2Cl2 gave 0.22 g (69%) of the desired protected imidazole 7 as a mixture of regioisomers which were carried on without separation. A solution of 7 (0.18 g, 0.62 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 ml) under argon was treated with methylmagnesium chloride (0.32 ml, 3.0 M in THF) and the resulting mixture was stirred 16 h. The reaction was quenched with a small amount of MeOH, concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues were taken up in H2O. The mixture was acidified by the dropwise addition of 1 N HC1 until the solution was homogenious and then the pH was adjusted to 7 with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The organic materials were extracted into CHC13 and the combined organic portions were washed consecutively with H2O and brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. Chromatography on SiO2 with 5% MeOH:CH2Cl2 gave 0.18 g (95%) of the alcohol 8 as a mixture of regioisomers which were carried on without separation.

The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure and subsequent purification by chromatography on SiO2 with 5% MeOH:CH2Cl2 gave 0.12 g (92%) of the alkenes 9 and 10 as a mixture of isomers which were carried on without separation. The mixture of isomers 9 and 10 (0.12 g, 0.42 mmol) were refluxed in a solution composed of MeOH (2 ml) and KOH (2 ml of a 5 N solution) for 30 h. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues were taken up in H2O and extracted exhaustively with CHC13.

Messier et al. (1995) "High throughput assays of cloned adrenergic, muscarinic, neurokinin and neurotrophin receptors in living mammalian cells", Pharmacol. Toxicol. 76:308-11 and adapted for use with alpha2 receptors. The assay measures a receptor-mediated loss of contact inhibition that results in selective proliferation of receptor-containing cells in a mixed population of confluent cells. The increase in cell number is assessed with an appropriate transfected marker gene such as b-galactosidase, the activity of which can be easily measured in a 96-well format. Receptors that activate the G protein, Gq, elicit this response. Alpha2 receptors, which normally couple to Gi, activate the RSAT response when coexpressed with a hybrid Gq protein that has a Gj receptor recognition domain, called Gq/i52. See Conklin et al. (1993) "Substitution of three amino acids switches receptor specificity of Gqa to thatof Gia." Nature 363:274-6.<br>
NIH-3T3 cells are plated at a density of 2x106 cells in 15 cm dishes and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. One day later, cells are cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation with mammalian expression plasmids encoding p-SV-b-galactosidase (5-10 mg), receptor (1-2 mg) and G protein (1-2 mg). 40 mg salmon sperm DNA may also be included in the transfection mixture. Fresh media is added on the following day and 1-2 days later, cells are harvested and frozen in 50 assay aliquots. Cells are thawed and 100 ml added to 100 ml aliquots of various concentrations of drugs in triplicate in 96-well dishes. Incubations continue 72-96 hr at 37°. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, b-galactosidase enzyme activity is determined by adding 200 ml of the chromogenic substrate (consisting of 3.5 mM o-<br><br>

nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside and 0.5% nonidet P-40 in phosphate buffered saline), incubating overnight at 30° and measuring optical density at 420 run. The absorbence is a measure of enzyme activity, which depends on cell number and reflects a receptor-mediated cell proliferation. The EC50 and maximal effect of each drug at each alpha2 receptor is determined. The efficacy or intrinsic activity is calculated as a ratio of the maximal effect of the drug to the maximal effect of a standard full agonist for each receptor subtype. Brimonidine, also called UK14,304-18, is used as the standard agonist for the alphas and alpha2c receptors. Oxymetazoline is the standard agonist used for the alpha2B receptor.<br>
Table 1, below, provides the intrinsic activity values at subtypes of the a2-adrenoreceptor as determined in the RSAT assay for the compounds of above Examples B through X and certain adrenergic compounds not having selective agonist activity at the  2B or  2B Ax2C subtype(s).

IOP-Lowering and Sedative Side Effects<br>
Measurements of IOP were made in fully conscious female cynomolgus monkeys weighing 3-4 kg with sustained elevated IOP that was produced in the right eye by argon laser photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork. Animals were usable for experiments ~ 2 months following surgery. During the experiments, monkeys sat in specially designed chairs (Primate Products, San Francisco), and were fed orange juice and fruit as needed. A 30R model Digilab pneumatonometer (Alcon, Texas) was used to measure IOP.<br>
Twenty five  l of an anesthetic (proparacaine) was topically applied to each monkey before IOP measurements to minimize ocular discomfort due to tonometry. Two baseline measurements were made prior to instillation of the drugs, followed by periodic measurements up to 6 hours post-instillation. The test compounds were administered unilaterally as a<br><br>
106<br>
single 50  l eye drop; the contralateral eyes received an equal volume of saline.<br>
Many of the a2B or a2B/2C selective compounds of the examples were tested in the monkeys. Surprisingly, as Table 2 shows, these structurally diverse compounds all lowered IOP in the treated eye.<br>
At the same time, sedation was measured and assessed according to the following score: 0 = alert, typical vocalization, movement, etc.; 1 = calm, less movement; 2= slightly sedated, some vocalization, responsive to stimulation; 3 - sedated, no vocalization, some response to stimulation; 4 = asleep.<br>
The compounds of the present invention also did not cause sedation. This contrasts with the action of clonidine and brimonidine, which caused sedation.<br>

The effects of 012-adrenoceptor agonists on IOP and sedation in conscious cynomolgus monkeys following ocular administration in eyes made unilaterally hypertensive by argon laser photocoagulation. Measurements were made periodically up to 6 hours. Sedation was assessed subjectively during the IOP experiments using the following scoring: 0 = alert, typical vocalization, movement, etc.; 1 = calm, less movement; 2 = slightly sedated, some vocalization, responsive to stimulation; 3 = sedated, no vocalization, some response to stimulation; 4 = asleep.

Measurement of Cardiovascular Side Effects<br>
Cardiovascular measurements were made in a different group of monkeys using a BP100S automated sphygmomanometer (Nippon Colin,. Japan). Intravenous (IV) administration of certain of the compounds of the present invention at doses ten to thirty times higher than the doses for clonidine and brimonidine did not reduce heart rate or lower blood pressure. Interestingly, the compound 4(5)-3-methylthiophen-2-ylmethyl)-lH-imidazole, which has intrinsic activity of 0.43 at the ct2A-subtype, exhibited a weak effect on heart rate. Clonidine and brimonidine had even greater effects on heart rate. See Table 3 below.<br>

EXAMPLE BB<br>
The studies in the above Examples Z and AA demonstrate that a therapeutic effect of alpha2 agonists can be separated from sedative and cardiovascular side effects. This separation is accomplished with compounds that share the property of being preferentially active at the alpha2B and alpha2B/alpha2C subtypes relative to the alpha2A subtype.<br>
The prior art alpha2 adrenergic agonists, which activate all three alpha2 receptors, cause sedation, hypotension and bradycardia, preventing or severely limiting their use for treating diseases and disorders that are known to be ameliorated by them.

syndromes, pain including neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative diseases including optic neuropathy, spinal ischemia and stroke, memory and cognition deficits, attention deficit disorder, psychoses including manic disorders, anxiety, depression, hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemia and nasal congestion. See, for example, Hieble et al., "Therapeutic applications of agents interacting with alpha-adrenoceptors, in Alpha-adrenoceptors: molecular biology, biochemistry and pharmacology". Prog. Basic Clin. Pharmacol. (Basel, Karger) 8, pp. 180-220(1991). For example, clonidine has been shown to be clinically effective in providing pain relief for postoperative, cancer-associated and neurogenic pain. But, as stated in Maze and Tranquilli, Maze MB and Tranquilli, W. "Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists: defining the role in clinical anesthesia". Anesthesiology 74, 581-605 (1991), the "full clinical promise" of this and other alpha2 agonists requires the development of compounds that do not cause sedation, hypotension and bradycardia.<br>
The above-listed diseases and disorders are treatable by activation of ct2B or a2B/2C receptor subtype(s). Therefore, the alpha2 compounds described above that have been shown above not to elicit sedation and cardiovascular effects, are useful and advantageous in the treatment of these conditions.<br>
Amelioration of neuronal degeneration in glaucomatous neuropathy is another example of the novel utility of the compounds of the invention. Recent studies have demonstrated that clonidine and other alpha2 agonists are neuroprotective of retinal cells in several rat models of neuronal degeneration. These models include light-induced photoreceptor degeneration in albino rat, as described in Wen et al, " Alpha2-adrenergic agonists induce basic fibroblast growth factor expression in photoreceptors in vivo and ameliorate light<br><br>
113<br>
damage." /. Neurosci. 16, 5986-5992 and calibrated rat optic nerve injury resulting in secondary loss of retinal ganglion cells, as described in Yoles et al, "Injury-induced secondary degeneration of rat optic nerve can be attenuated by alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists AGN 191103 and brimonidine". Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 37, 540,S114. However, unlike the compounds of the present invention, the doses used in these studies - 0.1 to &gt;1 mg/kg by intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection- also cause sedation and cardiovascular effects. Induction of the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is considered a sensitive indicator of alpha2 receptor activation in the retina (Wen et al above) and measurement of bFGF induction following topical administration of alpha2 agonists to rat eyes indicates that approximately a 1% dose is necessary to induce a 2-3 fold increase in bFGF levels that correspond with alpha2 agonist mediated neuroprotection (See Wen et al, above, and Lai et al, "Neuroprotective effect of ocular hypotensive agent brimonidine", in Proceedings ofXIth Congress of the European Society of Ophthalmology (Bologna, Monduzzi Editore), 439-444.) These topical doses of current alpha2 agonists such as clonidine are known to result in systemic side effects such as sedation and hypotension that would prevent their use as ocular neuroprotective agents. Additionally commonly assigned and co-pending application, 08/496,292 filed on 28 June, 1995, discloses and claims the use of certain non-selective ot2-adrenergic agents in treating neural injury, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
The compounds of the present invention do not cause sedation and cardiovascular effects following topical administration of doses of at least 3% in monkeys. Thus, neuroprotective concentrations of these compounds can be reached in humans without causing side effects. In fact, as reported below, the<br><br>
114<br>
compound of Example B-9(b) has been shown to be neuroprotective in the calibrated rat optic nerve injury model of Yoles et al, above. See Table 4, below.<br>
Table 4: Retinal Ganglion Cell Numbers at 2 Weeks Post-Injury (cells/microscopic field)<br><br>
This level of neuroprotection is comparable to the effect seen in previous studies with the standard alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, brimonidine, and the neuroprotective agent, MK801.<br>
Example CC<br>
Alleviation of pain including neuropathic pain is another example of a disorder in which the compounds of the invention are useful and advantageous since pain is alleviated without undesirable side effects. Clonidine, an agonist that activates all three alpha2 receptors, has been used clinically for treating chronic pain, but its utility for this indication is limited because it causes sedation and cardiovascular side effects. Compounds of the present invention were compared to clonidine and brimonidine in a rodent model of neuropathic pain that is known to be predictive of clinical activity. (See, for example, Kim, S. and Chung, J. "An experimental model for peripheral neuropathy produced by segmental spinal nerve ligation in the rat." Pain 50 pp. 355-363 (1992).) Following<br><br>
115<br>
ligation of two spinal nerves, the animals develop a sensitivity to normally non-painful stimuli such as touch. The ability of alpha2 compounds to reverse this sensitivity, called allodynia, was tested 30 minutes after dosing by either intrathecal or intraperitoneal administration. The sedative activity of each compound was also measured using an activity chamber. The compounds of the invention, exemplified by N-l, are able to alleviate the allodynia without causing sedation, even at very high doses. This is in contrast to clonidine and brimonidine, which cause sedation at doses only slightly higher than their anti-allodynic doses. See tables 5 and 6, below.<br>
Table 5. The anti-allodynic and sedative effects of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists in rats 30 minutes following intrathecal administration (N=6).<br><br><br>

The results of these Examples demonstrate that the common side effects of a2-adrenoceptor drugs are mediated by the a2A-subtype and that their ocular antihypertensive and other therapeutic actions can be mediated by a subtype other than the a2A-subtype. Thus, a2-adrenoceptor compounds of unrelated structural classes, that have in common low functional activity at the a2A-subtype, lower IOP and elicit other therapeutic actions without dose-limiting side effects.<br>
