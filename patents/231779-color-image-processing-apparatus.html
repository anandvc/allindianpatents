FIGS. 4A and 4B show the result obtained by performing a region-based search with respect to images indexed by a computer program based on the color<br>
image processing method according to the present invention.<br>
Best mode for carrying out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 illustrating a color image processing method according to the present invention, a color image A is input (step 100). The color image is segmented into a plurality of regions F1, F2, F3 and F4 (step 102). The segmentation can be performed based on edge flow, for example. Then, quantized color vectors for the respective regions F1, F2, F3 and F4 are obtained (step 104).<br>
The step of obtaining the quantized color vectors preferably includes the following steps. First, a predetermined filtering step for smoothing and noise removal of an image is performed as a pre-processing step. Next, the probability of pixels in the filtered image being noisy pixels is analyzed to then apply an appropriate weight to the same. The probability of pixels in the filtered image being noisy pixels is obtained by the color distance from neighboring pixels. For example, ipixels, in which i is an arbitrary integer, ranging from a pixel having the minimum color distance are selected among the pixels sorted according to the color distance from a central pixel, and among the selected pixels, the pixel value which has the largest color distance is set to the maximum color distance, which is denoted by T(n). Then, the color vectors of the respective pixels are weighted by exp(-T(n)). exp(-T(n)) is defined by v(n). Next, assuming that the average of T(n) values of all pixels is Tavg, the number N of initial clusters to be used in quantization equals Tavg * an arbitrary constant, e.g., 2. Then, a general Lloyd algorithm is applied to the color vectors corresponding to weighted pixels to quantize the color vectors. First, using the cluster centroid (c,) represented by Expression (1):<br>
wherein X(n) is the pixel value of the nth pixel among the sorted pixels, and a value<br>
wherein k is a predetermined positive integer representing the number of segmented regions of the image A (step 110).<br>
The color feature descriptor retrieved by the color image processing method according to the present invention is compactly represented by a small number of numbers with respect to one region. The compact representation of the color feature descriptor can remarkably reduce the computational complexity. This allows fast search and retrieval of multi-media based contents. The color image processing method according to the present invention can be applied to an object-based image processing method such as MPEG-7.<br>
The color image processing method is programmable by a computer program. Codes and code segments constituting the computer program can be easily derived by a computer programmer in the art. Also, the program is stored in computer readable media and is readable and executable by the computer, thereby embodying the color image processing method. The media include magnetic recording media, optical recording media, carrier wave media, and the like.<br>
Also, the color image processing method can be implemented on a color image processing apparatus. FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a color image processing apparatus according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3. the color image processing apparatus includes a segmenting unit 300, a color vector retrieving unit 302, a color feature descriptor generating unit 304 and a combining unit 306.<br>
In the operation of the color image processing apparatus, the segmenting unit 300 segments an input image A into k regions and sequentially outputs pixel value data Region,, in the klh region. The color vector retrieving unit 302 receives the pixel value data Region,, in the klh region and retrieves the color vectors [cL,, cU,. cVJ. When / color vectors [cLt, cUf, cVJ are all received, the color feature descriptor generating unit 304 obtains the percentiles Pl of dominant colors represented by the color vectors [cL,, cU,, cV], and generates and outputs color feature descriptor data Fk. The color feature descriptor data Ft includes information on the dominant colors represented by the color vectors [cL1, cU1, cVJ and their percentiles P,.<br>
In order to obtain the percentiles P, of the respective colors, it is more preferable that color quantization is performed within each segmented region. Thus,<br>
 represented by Expression (2) is calculated:<br>
to then split a cluster having the largest value of D,. This procedure is repeated until N clusters are generated. After N clusters are generated, a general Lloyd algorithm is performed. When the general Lloyd algorithm is performed, the cluster centroid is calculated by the Expression (1) to perform updating.<br>
Next, clusters having similar color vectors are agglomerated by performing agglomerative clustering. Agglomerative clustering is disclosed by R.O. Duda and P.E. Hart in "Pattern Classification and Scene Analysis, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1973," which will not be described in detail in this specification.<br>
Then, the color vectors are classified and dominant colors represented by color vectors [cLi, cUit cVJ and their percentiles Pi are obtained (step 106). Here, / denotes the arbitrary serial number of primary regions, ranging from 1 through N. L, U and V denote coordinates of the CIE LUV color coordinate system. The percentiles Pi are expressed by decimals. The sum of the percentiles Pi for i regions is 1 as represented by Expression (3):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Next, the dominant colors represented by color vectors [cLi, cUi, cVi,] and their percentiles Pi are expressed as the color feature descriptor of a pertinent region. obtained (step 108). In other words, the color feature descriptor F can be represented by Expression (4):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein N is a predetermined positive integer. The color feature descriptor can be referred to as a variable-bin color histogram.<br>
By combining pixel value data in the kth region, i.e., Regionk and color feature descriptor data of this region, i.e., Fk, the whole image A 'is represented by Expression (5):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
the color image processing apparatus preferably further includes a quantizing unit (not shown). The color image processing apparatus preferably further includes a filtering unit (not shown) for performing a predetermined filtering process for smoothing and noise removal of the input image. The quantizing unit analyzes the probability of pixels in the filtered image being noisy pixels, applies an appropriate weight thereto and quantizes the color vectors corresponding to the weighted pixels by a general Lloyd algorithm.<br>
The combining unit 306 combines pixel value data in the kth region, i.e., Regionk and color feature descriptor data of this region, i.e., Fk, to output the processed image A '. The color image processing apparatus according to the present invention can be applied to an object-based image processing method such as MPEG-7. Also, in the color image processing apparatus according to the present invention, expressing a color image using dominant colors of the image can also be applied to various other fields besides the field of color image processing.<br>
As described above, the color image processing method according to the present invention is applied to an object-based image processing method, thereby allowing fast search and retrieval of multi-media contents.<br>
