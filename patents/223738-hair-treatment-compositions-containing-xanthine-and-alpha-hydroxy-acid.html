The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
	GRANTED<br>

ORIGINAL<br>
1-MUMNP-2005<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for cosmetically treating hair by composition particularly suitable to style and lengthen hair,<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
For centuries long hair has been a desirable attribute. To achieve this straightening devices are sold that mechanically lengthen and straighten the hair, a selection of such devices are disclosed in EP 0 511 892 and W012/32381 An alternative to the above mechanical approach to lengthen the hair is to stimulate hair growth using chemical hair growth stimulants, such products are disclosed in EP 0 897 712 and WO92/07877.<br>
The use of xanthines in hair and skin pigmentation is described in US 5470579. US 4931066 discloses that xanthines can be used together with other compounds in hair dyeing.<br>
Xanthines have also been claimed as being useful in the treatment of hair loss. For example, WO 85/05270, WO 84/04038, FR 2 751 541 and WO 85/05272 all disclose hair loss treatments containing caffeine or theophylline as phosphodiesterase inhibitors. A hair nourishing lotion or<br><br>
shampoo containing caffeine and the hair loss treatment compound minoxidil is described in JP 04-193821.<br>
The present application discloses formulations and processes for lengthening hair. The invention has the further advantages that it prevents the hair frizzing and increasing in volume. Yet another advantage is that it increases the hair's susceptibility and hold to styling in humid conditions.<br>
DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method<br>
of treating hair comprising the step of applying to the hair<br>
a leave on hair treatment composition comprising:<br>
i)   an a-hydroxy acid and/or its salt; and<br>
ii)  a xanthine, a substitued xanthine or mixtures thereof<br>
A further aspect of the invention is the use of i)  a a-hydroxy acid and/or its salt; and ii)  a xanthine, a substituted xanthine or mixtures thereof<br>
for styling hair, in particular lengthening, reducing the volume and increasing the high humidity style retention of the hair.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that Xanthine and alpha-hydroxy acid combinations are particularly useful in styling hair, lengthening hair, reducing its volume and increasing the high humidity style retention.<br>
Xanthines<br>
Preferred xanthines (the term xanthines are taken as meaning xanthines and substituted xanthines) are compounds having formula I<br><br>
in which R1' R2  and R3 are independently selected from H, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C5 alkyl groups, substituted or unsubstituted C2-C5 alkenyl groups, aryl groups arylalkyl groups or mixtures thereof,.  It is preferable if the substituted groups discussed above are amine or hydroxy groups.<br>
It is advantageous if R1' R2 and R3 are H, Ci-Cs alkyl, C2-C5 alkenyl or mixtures thereof, it is particularly preferred if R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from H, methyl groups or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Most preferred are substituted xanthines such as caffeine, dyphylline, cafaminol theophylline, aminophylline and theobromine. Of these, caffeine is particularly preferred.<br>
The Xanthines may be in the form of a salt. The cosmetically acceptable salts of the xanthines of formula (I) are salts, which are non-toxic to humans in the context of the uses according to the invention. The nature of the salt will depend on the acidic or basic groups present in the xanthines which will depend, in turn, on their precise structural formula.

Experimental Methodology<br>
   Set of swatches of hair were made from naturally curly hair. The initial length of all the swatches were measured before the treatment by taking a photograph and using a ruler (L0) . The swatches were cleaned using a base shampoo. The treatment protocol was as follows. All swatches were treated<br>
   twice with 9%w/w of a shampoo by massaging the shampoo into the hair for 30 seconds and then rinsing for 30 seconds. Thereafter, 18%w/w of a conditioner was applied by massaging it to the hair for 60 seconds and then rinsing it for 60 seconds. Thereafter, the switches were treated with<br><br>
Examples 1 and A by soaking the switch in these Examples for 15 minutes, shaking off excess water and finally combing it before leaving it to dry at 20°C, 50RH for 3hours. At this stage the length of the swatches were measured (L1) . Furthermore, a final length of the swatches (L1) were measured after exposure to 30°C, 80RH for 3hours.<br>
For Examples 2 and B the switches were treated with 9%w/w of these products by massaging them into the hair switches, combing these switches straight and leaving them to dry. All swatches after treatment were dried under controlled environment of 20°C, 50RH for 3hours.<br>
Once the swatches were dry their length was measured again and the swatches were moved to a new environment of 30°C and 80RH for 3 hours. A third and final measurement of the length of the swatches was made. In case of treatment of swatches with Examples B and 2, the comparisons were made after 8 treatment cycles.<br>
The following formula was used for converting the length measurements into % lengthening against control (Example A or Example B). The results are shown in the table below.<br><br>
where, i stands for Examples according to the invention (1 and 2) and j stands for the comparative Examples (A and B), respectively.<br><br>
Formulation	% Lengthening after drying @20°C, 50RH	% Lengthening after exposure @30°C, BORH<br>
Example 1 vs Example A	13.85	9.67<br>
Example 2 vs Example B	7.74	6.72<br>
Examples C, D, E , F, 3 and 4<br>
Solutions were formulated each containing 1% by weight of t<br>
examples. Hair curls were made up using perming rods and<br>
30cm length hair. The curls were placed in the solution for<br>
1 hour, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water and<br>
dried for 30 minutes. The hair was removed from the curling<br>
rod and the length of the curl measured.<br>
The hair was hung in high humidity environmental chamber<br>
(90%RH, 30°C) with fan agitation for 1 minute and measured<br>
again.<br><br>

6.	A method according to any preceding claim in which the a -hydroxy acid and/or its salt if optically active is in the L-form.	<br>
7.	A method according to any preceding claim in which the total amount of acid/salt i) is from 0.1 to 20 wt% in the total formulation.<br>
8.       A method according to any preceding claim in which the total amount xanthine ii) is from 0.1 to 20 wt% in the total formulation.<br>
9.	A method according to any preceding claim in which the hair treatment composition<br>
           comprises a surfactant.<br>
10.	A method according to any preceding claim, in which the hair treatment composition<br>
comprises a cationic, or silicone based conditioning agent.<br>
11.	A method according to any preceding claim in which the hair treatment composition             comprises a styling agent.<br>
12.	A method according to any preceding claim in which the hair treatment composition             comprises an aqueous base.<br>
