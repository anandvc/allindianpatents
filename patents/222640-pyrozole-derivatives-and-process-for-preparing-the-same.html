The present invention relates to a group of novel pyrazole derivatives to methods for the preparation of these compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing one ore more of these compounds as an active component.<br>
The above mentioned 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyra2oles are potent cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonists with utility for the treatment of disorders involving cannabinoid neurotransmission.<br>
Cannabinoids are present in the Indian hemp Cannabis sativa and have been used as medicinal agents for centuries (Mechoulam, R. and Feigenbaum, J.J. Prog. Med Chem. 1987, 24, 159). However, only within the past ten years the research in the cannabinoid area has revealed pivotal information on cannabinoid receptors and their (endogenous) agonists and antagonists. The discovery and the subsequent cloning of two different subtypes of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) stimulated the search for novel cannabinoid receptor antagonists (Munro, S. et ai, Nature 1993, 365, 61. Matsuda, L.A. and Bonner, T.I. Cannabinoid Receptors, Pertwee, R.G. Ed. 1995, 117, Academic Press, London). In addition, pharmaceutical companies became interested in the development of cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system (Consroe, P. Neurobiology of Disease 1998, 5, 534. Pop, E. Curr. Opin. In CPNS Investigational Drugs 1999, 1, 587. Greenberg, D.A. Drug News Perspect. 1999, 12, 458. Pertwee, R.G., Progress in Neurobiology 2001, 63, 569). Hitherto, several CB1 receptor antagonists are known. Sanofi disclosed their diarylpyrazole congeners as selective CB1 receptor antagonists. A representative example is SR-141716A (Dutta, A.K. et al., Med. Chem. Res, 1994, 5, 54. Lan, R. et aL, J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 769. Nakamura-Palacios, E.M, et al, CNS Drug Rev. 1999, 5, 43). CP-272871 is a pyrazole derivative, like SRI 41716A, but less potent and less CB1 receptor subtype-selective than SR141716A (Meschler, J.P. et ai, Biochem. PharmacoL 2000, 60, 1315). Aminoalkylindoles have been disclosed as CB-j receptor antagonists. A representative example is lodopravadoline (AM-630), which was introduced in 1995. AM-630 is a moderately active CB1 receptor antagonist, but sometimes behaves as a weak partial agonist (Hosohata, K. et al., Life So. 1997, 61, PL115). Researchers from Eli Lilly described aryl-aroyl substituted benzofurans as selective CB1 receptor antagonists (e.g. LY-320135) (Felder, C.C. et ai, J. Pharmacol Exp. Then 1998, 284, 291). 3-Alkyl-5,5'-diphenylimidazolidinediones were described as cannabinoid receptor ligands, which were indicated to be cannabinoid antagonists (Kanyonyo, M. et ai, Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999, 9, 2233). Aventis Pharma claimed diarylmethyleneazetidine analogs as CB1 receptor antagonists (Mignani, S. et ai. Patent PR 2783246. 2000; Chem. Abstr. 2000. 132, 236982). Tricyclic pyrazoles were claimed by Sanofi-Synthelabo as CB1 antagonists (Barth, F, et ai, Patent WO 0132663, 2001; Chem. Abstr. 2001, 134, 340504). Interestingly, many CB1 receptor<br><br>
antagonists have been reported to behave as inverse agonists in vitro (Landsman, R.S. e^ a/., Eur. J. Pliarmacol. 1997, 334, R1). Reviews provide a nice overview of the cannabinoid research area (Mechoulam, R. ef a/.. Prog, Med, Ciiem. 1998, 35, 199. Lambert, D.M. Cum Med. Cliem, 1999, 6, 635. Mechoulam, R. et al., Eur J. Pharmacol. 1998, 359, 1. Williamson, E.M. and Evans, FJ. Drugs 2000, 60, 1303. Pertwee, R.G. Addiction Biology 2000, 5, 37. Robson, P. Br. J. Psychiatry 2001, 178, 107. Pertwee, R. G. Prog, Neurobiol. 2001, 63, 569. Goya, P and Jagerovic, N. Exp. Opin, Then Patents 2000, 10, 1529. Pertwee, R. G. Gut 2001, 48, 859).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that potent and selective antagonism of cannabinoid-CB1 receptors is present in the novel 4,5-dihydro-1 H-pyrazole derivatives of the formula (la) or (lb), prodrugs thereof, tautomers thereof and salts thereof<br><br>

The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB1 receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor is stably transfected In conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB1 antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB1 receptors aR6 stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CB1 receptors by CB1 receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55,940 or (R)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB1 receptor-mediated response can be antagonised by CB1 receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>

The preparation of the compounds is illustrated in the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N'-(((ethyl)propylamino)sulfonyl)-N-methyi-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1 H-py razole-l -carboxamidine<br>
Part A: To a stirred solution of ((ethyl)propylamino)sulfonyl isothiocyanate (5.98 gram, 25.4 mmol) in dry dichloromethane in a nitrogen atmospheR6 is added of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (6.52 gram, 25.4 mmol). After stirring for 90 minutes the resulting solution is concentrated in vacuo and purified by column chromatography (CH2CI2, silicagel, Rf --0.45). The resulting solid is recrystallized       from       diethyl       ether       to       give       3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-<br><br><br><br><br><br>
room temperatuR6 and stirred for another 2 hours. After cooling to 0 °C liquid dimethylamine (5 mL) is added and the resulting solution is stirred for another hour at 0 °C and for 2 hours at room temperature. The solution is washed with water, filtered over hyflo and concentrated in vacuo. Flash chromatography (MTBE. Rf - 0.3) gives 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((dimethylamino)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamide (4.75 g, 58 %). MP: 210-212 °C.<br>
Part B: A mixtuR6 of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((dimethylamino)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamide (1.47 gram, 3.62 mmol) and phosphorus pentachloride (0.80 gram. 3-84 mmol) in chlorobenzene (20 mL) is heated at reflux temperatuR6 for 1 hour. After thorough concentration in vacuo, the formed 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((dimethylamino)sulfonyl)-4-phenyI-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboximidoyl chloride is suspended in dry dichloromethane and reacted with cold n-propylamine (1.0 mL) at 0 °C. After stirring for 1 hour, the mixtuR6 is dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed with water and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is purified by column chromatography (dichloromethane/acetone = 19/1 (v/v), Rf - 0.35) to give an oil (0.82 g). Crystallisation from diethyl ether, followed by recrystallisation from ethanol gives 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((dimethylamino)sulfonyl)-N"propyl-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (0.38 gram, 23 % yield). MP: 127-129'C.<br>

3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-((piperidin-1-yl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboximidothioic acid methyl ester<br>
Part A: To a stirred solution of (piperidin-l-yl)sulfonyl isothiocyanate (54.77 g, 266 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (900 mL) in a nitrogen atmospheR6 is added 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole (68.3 gram, 266 mmol). After stirring for 16 hours an additional amount of dichloromethane is added. The resulting solution is twice washed with water, dried over Na2S04, and concentrated in vacuo. After addition of MTBE, the residue crystallizes. The crystalline material is collected and washed with MTBE to give 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-N-((piperidin-1 -yl)sulfonyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-thiocarboxamide (77.6 gram, 63 % yield). Part B: To a stirred solution of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-N-((piperidin-1-yl)sulfonyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-thiocarboxamide (30 gram, 64.9 mmol) in acetone (1 L) is added triethylamine (18.0 mL, 130 mmol). To the resulting yellow solution is added methyl iodide (9.12 g, 64 mmol) and the resulting solution is stirred<br><br>
for 16 hours at room temperature. The formed precipitate is removed by filtration. The filtrate is washed with water, concentrated in vacuo to give a yellow solid. Recrystallisation from MTBE gives 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-((piperidin-1-yl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboximidothioic acid methyl ester (27.9 gram, 90% yield). MP: 192-194 °C.<br>
