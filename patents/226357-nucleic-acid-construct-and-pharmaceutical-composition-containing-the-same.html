FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nucleic acid constructs, pharmaceutical compositions and methods which can be used to downregulate angiogenesis in specific tissue regions of a subject. More particularly, the present invention relates to nucleic acid constructs, which can be used to activate apoptosis in specific cell subsets, thus, enabling treatment of diseases characterized by excessive or aberrant neovascularization or cell growth.<br>
Angiogenesis is the growth of new blood vessels, a process that depends mainly on locomotion, proliferation, and tube formation by capillary endothelial cells. During angiogenesis, endothelial cells emerge from their quiescent state and proliferate rapidly. Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for transition of a cell to angiogenic phenotype are not known, the sequence of events leading to the formation of new vessels has been well documented [Hanahan, D., Science 277,48-50, (1997)]. The vascular growth entails either endothelial sprouting [Risau, W., Nature 386, 671-674, (1997)] or intussusceptions [Patan, S., et al; Microvasc. Res. 51, 260-272, (1996)]. In the first pathway, the following sequence of events may occur: (a) dissolution of the basement of the vessel, usually a post capillary venule, and the interstitial matrix; (b) migration of endothelial cells toward the stimulus; (c) proliferation of endothelial cells trailing behind the leading endothelial cell (s); (d) formation of lumen (canalization) in the endothelial array/sprout; (e) formation of branches and loops by confluencial anastomoses of sprouts to permit blood flow; (f) investment of the vessel with pericytes (i.e., periendothelial cells and smooth muscle cells); and (g) formation of basement membrane around the immature vessel. New vessels can also be formed via<br><br>
the second pathway: insertion of interstitial tissue columns into the lumen of preexisting vessels. The subsequent growth of these columns and their stabilization result in partitioning of the vessel lumen and remodeling of the local vascular network.<br>
A variety of angiogenic factors govern the angiogenic process. It is understood that during pathology, the fme balance between pro-angiogenic factors and anti-angiogenic factors is disrupted, thereby eliciting nonself-limiting endothelial and periendothelial cell-proliferation. Until recently, the angiogenesis that occurs in diseases of ocular neovascularization, arthritis, skin diseases, and tumors, had been difficult to suppress therapeutically.<br>
Therefore, the fundamental goal of all anti-angiogenic therapy is to return foci of proliferating microvessels to their normal resting state, and to prevent their regrowth [Cancer: Principles &amp; Practice of Oncology, Fifth Edition, edited by Vincent T. DeVita, Jr., Samuel Hellman, Steven A. Rosenberg. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia. (1997)].<br>
Anti-angiogenic therapy is a robust clinical approach, as it can delay the progression of tumor growth (e.g., retinopathies, benign and malignant angiogenic tumors).<br>
In general, every disease caused by uncontrolled growth of capillary blood vessels such as diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, arthritis, hemangiomas, tumor growth and metastasis is a target for anti-angiogenic therapy.<br>
For example, the progressive growth of solid tumors beyond clinically occult sizes (e.g., a few mm) requires the contmuous formation of new blood vessels, a process known as tumor angiogenesis. Tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent. A tumor must continuously stimulate the growth of new capillary blood vessels to deliver nutrients and oxygen for the tumor itself to grow. Therefore, either prevention of tumor angiogenesis or selective destruction of tumor's existing blood vessels (vascular targeting therapy) underlies anti-angiogenic tumor therapy.<br><br>
Recently, a plethora of anti-angiogenic agents has been developed for the treatment of malignant diseases, some of which are already under clinical trials (for review see Herbst et al. (2002) Semin. Oncol. 29:66-77).<br>
The most studied target for tumor anti-angiogenic treatment is the dominant process regulating angiogenesis m human i.e., the interaction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with its receptor (VEGFR). Agents which regulate VEGFR pro-angiogenic action include (i) antibodies directed at the VEGF protein itself or to the receptor (e.g., rhuMAb VEGF); (ii) small molecule compounds directed to the VEGFR tyrosine kinase (e.g., ZD6474 and SU5416); (iii) VEGFR targeted ribozymes.<br>
Other novel angiogenesis inhibitors include 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME2) a natural metabolite of estradiol that possesses unique anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic properties and angiostatin and endostatin - proteolytic cleavage fragments of plasminogen and collagen XVIII, respectively.<br>
Though promising in pre-clinical models, to date systemic administration of all anti-angiogenic agents tested m clmical trials, have shown limited rate of success and considerable toxicities including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and hemoptysis. These results suggest that there may be limits to the use of current tumor anti-angiogenic agents as therapy for advanced malignancies. O'Reilly et al. have shown that the latency between the mitiation of anti-angiogenic therapy and antitumor effect may result in initial tumor progression before response to therapy [O'Reilly S et al. (1998) Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 17:217a]. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the regulation of angiogenesis may differ among capillary beds, suggesting that anti-angiogenic therapy may need to be optimized on an organ/tissue-specific basis [Arap et al. (1998) Science 279:377-380].<br>
Interestingly, poor results have also been obtained when anti-angiogenic therapy (e.g., heparin, heparin-peptide treatment) directed at smooth muscle cell proliferation has been practiced on myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease [Liu et al., Circulation, 79: 1374-1387<br><br>
(1989); Goldman et al., Atherosclerosis, 65: 215-225 (1987); Wolinsky et al., JACC, 15 (2): 475-481 (1990)]. Various limitations associated with the use of such agents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases included: (i) systemic toxicity creating intolerable level of risk for patients with cardiovascular diseases; (ii) interference with vascular wound healing following surgery; (iii) possible damage to surrounding endothelium and/or other medial smooth muscle cells.<br>
In-light of these and the inherent obstacles associated with systemic administration of anti-angiogenic factors (i.e., manufacturing limitations based on in-vitro instability and high doses required; and peak kinetics of bolus administration attributing to sub-optimal effects) limit the effective use of angiogenic factors m treating neo-vascularization associated diseases.<br>
With the identification of new genes that regulate the angiogenic process, somatic gene therapy has been attempted to overcome these limitations. Although, great efforts have been directed towards developing methods for gene therapy of cancer, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases, there is still major obstacles to effective and specific gene delivery [for review see, Feldman AL. (2000) Cancer 89(6): 1181-94] In general, the main limiting factor of gene therapy with a gene of interest, using a recombinant viral vector as a shuttle is the ability to specifically direct the gene of interest to the target tissue.<br>
Attempts to overcome these limitations included the use of tissue-specific promoters conjugated to cytotoxic genes. For example, endothelial cell targeting of a cytotoxic gene, expressed under the control endothelial-specific promoters has been described by Jagger et al who used the KDR or E-selectin promoter to express TNFa specifically in endothelial cells [Jaggar RT. Et al. Hum Gene Ther (1997) 8(18):2239-47]. Ozaki et al used the von-Willebrand factor (vWF) promoter to deliver herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) to HUVEC [Hum Gene Ther (1996)  7(13): 1483-90].<br><br>
However, these promoters showed only weak activity and did not allow for high levels of expression.<br>
An altemate approach presented by Kong and Crystal included a tumor specific expression of anti-angiogenic factors. To date, however, the toxicity of recombinant forms of endogenous anti-angiogenic agents has not been demonstrated although some synthetic anti-angiogenic agents have been associated with toxicity in preclinical models [Kong and Crystal (1998) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 90:273-76].<br>
Angiostatin has also been used as a possible anti-angiogenic agent (Falkman et al, Cell 1997 Jan 24;88(2):277-85), however due to the redundancy of factors involved in regulation of angiogenesis in tumors, it is highly unlikely that angiostatin therapy alone would be effective.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have a novel approach for efficiently down-regulating angiogenesis in specific tissue regions of a subject while being devoid of the toxic side effects characterizing prior art anti-angiogenesis approaches.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is of nucleic acid constructs and methods, which can be used to treat diseases characterized by excessive or aberrant neovascularization or cell growth. Specifically, the present invention can be used to specifically target and kill cells involved in angiogenesis, thus enabling down-regulation of angiogenesis and anti-tumor therapy.<br>
The principles and operation of the present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the mvention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed<br><br>
herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
One of the most fundamental goals of anti-angiogenic therapy is to return foci of proliferating microvessels to their normal resting state, and to prevent their re-growth.<br>
To date, anti-angiogenic therapy approaches, which employ systemic administration of anti-angiogenic agents have been employed with limited success mostly due to the toxic side effects which lead to the formation of thrombocytopenia, leukopenia and/or hemoptysis in the treated individual. The toxic side effects associated with prior art approaches is a result of non¬specific expression of the anti-angiogenic agents employed and exposure of healthy tissue to these agents or the redundancy and thus non-effectiveness of the anti-angiogenic agents used.<br>
While reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have uncovered that a combination of tissue-specific expression and specific activation of a pro-apoptotic agent enables selective apoptosis of cells involved in angiogenesis without exposing non-targeted tissue or cells to these agents, thus, avoiding the toxic side effects and redundancy characterizmg prior art treatment approaches.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect of the present mvention there is provided a method of down-regulating angiogenesis in a tissue of a subject. As used herein, the phrase "down-regulating angiogenesis" refers to either slowmg down or stopping the angiogenic process, which lead to formation of new blood vessels.<br>
The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by administering to the subject a nucleic acid construct designed and configured for generating apoptosis in a sub-population of angiogenic cells. As used herein, the phrase "angiogenic cells" refers to any cells, which participate or contribute to the process of angiogenesis. Thus, angiogenic cells include but are not limited to, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells.<br><br>
In order to direct specific expression of an apoptotic agent in a subpopulation of angiogenic cells, the nucleic acid construct of the present invention includes a first polynucleotide region encodmg a chimeric polypeptide including a ligand binding domam which can be, for example, a cell-surface receptor domain of a receptor tyrosine kinase, a receptor serine kinase, a receptor threonine kinase, a cell adhesion molecule or a phosphatase receptor fused to an effector domain of an apoptosis signaling molecule such as, for example, Fas, TNFR, and TRAIL.<br>
Such a chimeric polypeptide can include any ligand binding domain fused to any apoptosis signaling domain as long as activation of the ligand binding domain, i.e., via ligand binding, triggers apoptosis signaling via the effector domain of the apoptosis signaling molecule.<br>
Selection of the ligand binding domain and the apoptosis signaling domain fused thereto is affected according to the type of angiogenic cell targeted for apoptosis. For example, when targeting specific subset of endothelial cells (e.g., proliferating endothelial cells, or endothelial cells exhibiting a tumorous phenotype), the chimeric polypeptide includes a ligand binding domain capable of binding a ligand naturally present in the environment of such endothelial cells and preferably not present in endothelial cells of other non-targeted tissues (e.g., TNF, VEGF ). Such a ligand can be secreted by endothelial cells (autocrine), secreted by neighboring tumor cells (paracrine) or specifically targeted to these endothelial cells.<br>
Examples of suitable chimeric polypeptides are provided in Examples 2 of the Examples section which follows. Preferably, the chimeric polypeptide is the Fas-c chimera which is described in detail in Examples 2-4 of the Examples section which follows.<br>
The use of such a chuneric polypeptide is particularly advantageous, since, as shown in the Examples section hereinunder, it enables efficient and robust activation of apoptosis in a specific subset of angiogenic cells while<br><br>

As used herein a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation of one or more of the active ingredients or agents described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism.<br>
Hereinafter, the phrases "physiologically acceptable carrier" and "phannaceutically acceptable carrier" which may be interchangeably used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered nucleic acid construct. An adjuvant is included under these phrases.<br>
Herein the term "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remmgton's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition, which is incorporated herem'by reference.<br><br>
Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, especially transnasal, intestinal or parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intramedullary injections as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, inrtaperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections.<br>
Alternately, one may administer the pharmaceutical composition in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the pharmaceutical composition directly into a tissue region of a patient. In the context of the present invention, administration directly mto tumor tissue is a relevant example of local administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use m accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active ingredients into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
For injection, the active ingredient of the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution. Ringer's solution, or physiological salt buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical composition to be formulated as tablets, pills,<br><br>
dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmacological preparations for oral use can be made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carbomethylcellulose; and/or physiologically acceptable polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arable, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally, include push-fit capsules made of gelatin as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules may contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredients may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for the chosen route of admmistration.<br><br>
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
For administration by nasal inhalation, the active ingredients for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized pack or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichJorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichloro-tetrafluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in a dispenser may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose containers with optionally, an added preservative. The compositions may be suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active preparation in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active ingredients may be prepared as appropriate oily or water based injection suspensions. Suitable lipophiUc solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acids esters such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances, which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contam suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the active ingredients to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br><br>
Alternatively, me active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water based solution, before use.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may also be fomiulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained m an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of active ingredients (e.g. antisense oligonucleotide) effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disorder (e.g., progressive loss of bone mass) or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.<br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br>
For any preparation used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from in vitro and cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in an animal model, such as the murme Src deficient model of osteopetrosis (Boyce et al. (1992) J. Clin. Invest. 90, 1622-1627; Lowe et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 4485-4489; Soriano et al. (1991) Cell 64, 693-702), to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro, in cell cultures or experimental animals. The data obtained from these in vitro and cell culture assays and anknal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human.   The dosage may vary dependmg upon the<br><br>
dosage forna employed and the route ot administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl, et al, 1975, m "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.l).<br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to levels of the active ingredient are sufficient to retard tumor progression (minimal effective concentration, MEC). The MEC will vary for each preparation, but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. Detection assays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.<br>
Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, dosing can be of a single or a plurality of administrations, with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks or diminution of the disease state is achieved.<br>
The amoimt of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contam one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accommodated by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a preparation of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical<br><br>
carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition, as if further detailed above.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may further include any additional ingredients which may improve the uptake of the nucleic acid construct by the cells, expression of the chimeric polypeptide encoded by the nucleic acid construct in the cells, or the activity of the expressed chimeric polypeptide.<br>
For example, the uptake of adenoviral vectors into EC cells can be enhanced by treating the vectors with engineered antibodies or small peptides. Such "adenobody" treatment, was shown effective in directing adenovirus constructs to EGF receptors on cells (Watkins et al 1997, Gene Therapy 4:1004-1012). In addition, Nicklin et al have shown that A small peptide, isolated via phage display, increased specificity and efficiency of vectors in endothelial cells and decreased the expression in liver cells in culture (Nicklin et al 2000, Circulation 102:231-237). In a recent study, an FGF retargeted adenoviral vector reduced the toxicity of tk in mice (Printz et al 2000, Human Gene Therapy 11:191-204).<br>
It will be appreciated that although targeting of cells exposed to the ligand is preferred, the present invention also envisages expression of the nucleic acid construct of the present invention in cells which are not exposed to, or naturally affected by the ligand. In such cases, the method of the present invention includes the step of administering such a ligand to the cells transformed. Such administration can be effected by usmg any of the above described administration methods. Preferably, the ligand is adramistrated in a cell targeted manner, using for example antibody conjugated targeting, such that activation of apoptosis signaling is highly specific. This approach of apoptosis activation is described m more detail in the Examples section which follows.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides nucleic acid constructs, pharmaceutical  compositions including  such constructs  and methods  of<br><br>
utilizing such constructs for down-regulating angiogenesis in tissue regions characterized by excessive or abnormal angiogenesis.<br>
Since the present invention enables targeted expression in specific cell subsets, it can also be modified and used in for treating various tumors.<br>
Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating tumors.<br>
The method according to this aspect of the present invention is effected by expressing in tumor cells the chimeric polypeptide described above.<br>
Thus according to this aspect of the present invention, expression of the polypeptide chimera is directed by a tumor specific element, such as, but not limited to, the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) promoter [AP293321S3; Morimoto E Anticancer Res 2001 Jan-Feb;21(lA):329-31], the hlERT promoter [AH007699; Gu J , Gene Ther 2002 Jan;9(l):30-7], the Hexokinase type II promoter [AF148512; Katabi MM, Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jan 20;10(2):155-64.], or the L-plastin promoter [L05490, AH002870, MMU82611; PengXY, Cancer Res. 2001 Jun 1;61(11):4405-13].<br>
Expression of the polypeptide chimera (e.g., Fas-c) in tumor cells activates apoptosis in these cells and thus leads to cell death, which in turn causes tumor growth slowdown or arrest, and possibly tumor shrinkage.<br>
Additional objects, advantages, and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Additionally, each of the various embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated hereinabove and as claimed in the claims section below fmds experimental support in the following examples.<br><br>

These techniques and various other techniques are generally performed according to Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). The manual is hereinafter referred to as "Sambrook". Other general references are provided throughout this document. The procedures therein are believed to be well known m the art and are provided for the convenience of the reader. All the information contained therein is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 In-vitro assay for pro-apoptotic gene activity in endothelial cells (BAEC) and 293 cells<br>
In cancer treatment, anti-angiogenic therapy targets the evolving vasculature which nourishes the growing tumor [Folkman J. N Engl J Med (1995) 333(26):1757-63]. As the research of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, has progressed, numerous genes that encode selective and efficient cell death regulators have been identified [Strasser et al. Annu Rev Biochem (2000) 69:217-45.].<br>
The present study screened several pro-apoptotic genes in order to identify an agent most suitable for anti-angiogenic therapy. Several pro-apoptotic genes including MORTl (FADD - Fas associated death domain protein, GenBank Accession number NM 003824), RIP (receptor-interacting-<br><br>
protein, GenBank Accession number U25995), CASH (c-FLIP, GenBank Accession number AF010127), MACH (caspase 8 GenBank Accession number X98172), CPP32 (caspase 3, GenBank Accession number U13737), caspase 9 (U60521) and Fas-chimera (Fas-c), a previously described fiision of two "death receptors", constructed from the extracellular region of TNFRl and the trans-membrane and intracellular regions of Fas [Boldin MP et al. J Biol Chem (1995) 270(14):7795-8, see Figure la) were PCR amplified and cloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Inc.) mammalian expression vector using well known prior art cloning techniques.<br>
These pro-apoptotic gene constructs were co-expressed along with pGFP in BAEC (Bovine Aortic Endothelial Cells) and 293 cells, which were used as non-endothelial control cells. 24 hours post transfection, cells were analyzed using fluorescent microscopy. Apoptotic ceils were identified based on typical morphology, (i.e., small and round shape) using fluorescence microscopy (Figures 2a-b). Further assessment of the apoptotic phenotype was effected using electron microscopy (Figures 3a-f). Quantification of the apoptotic effect showed that MORTl, TNFRl and Fas-chimera induced the highest apoptotic activity in BAEC and 293 cells (Figure 4a-b). Caspase 3 and 9 were less potent in this respect, probably because they were in an inactive zymogen form. Based on these results, the Fas-chimera (Fas-c) gene was selected for the generation of an adenoviral-vector to be used in anti-angiogenic therapy.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Production of recombinant adenoviruses encoding Fas-chimera under the control of the modified PPE-1 promoter<br>
A cDNA encoding a full length Fas-chimera was subcloned into the plasmid pPACPPEl-3x containing the modified pre-proendothelinl promoter (see Figure lb). Recombinant adenoviruses were produced by co-transfection<br><br>
of this plasmid with pJM17 plasmid into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Successful viral cloning was verified via PCR amplification (Figure 5a).<br>
In order to determine the expression of Fas-c in the target cells, endothelial BAEC cells were transduced with the indicated titer of Ad-PPE-Fas-c. 72h post transduction cells were lysed and cellular proteins resolved using a non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-TNFRl antibody (Sc-7895, Santa-Cruz Biotech). As demonstrated in Figure 5b, a prominent band migrating at 45kD was clearly evident and its expression was dose-dependent, suggesting correct folding and expression of the chimeric protein. In contrast, no corresponding bands were evident in non-transduced endothelial cells or in cells transduced with control empty viral vector. Thus, these results confirmed that the adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of Fas-c results m transgene expression in the target cells.<br>
EXAMPLES Ad-PPE-Fas-c expression induces apoptosis in endothelial cells<br>
The ability of Ad-PPE-Fas chimera to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells was determined. As shown in Figures 6a-b, pre-proendothelin directed, adenovirus-mediated transduction of endothelial cells resulted in an evident and massive cell death; HUVEC and BAEC infected with Ad-PPE-Fas-c (10 MOI) had morphological features of adherent cells undergoing apoptosis mcluding membrane blebbing, rounding and shrinking and detachment from the culture dish. In contrast, cells infected with control viruses at the same MOI, mamtained normal appearance and growth rate. Cells transduced with 100 MOI presented only a minimal degree of cell death (data not shown).<br>
Further assessment of the cytotoxic properties of Ad-PPE-Fas-c was effected by expressing this virus in cells expressing the reporter gene GFP under the control of the PPE-1 promoter. As is evident from Figures 6c-d, most of the transduced cells acquired a typical apoptotic appearance 72 hours<br><br>
following transduction, whereas cells co-transduced with control virus and Ad-PPE-GFP appeared normal.<br>
The cytotoxic effect of Fas-c was quantified using crystal violet staining. As shown m Figure 7, infection of BAEC and HUVEC with Ad-PPE-Fas-c resulted in mortality rates of 57 % and 65 %, respectively, while the control virus did not affect cell viability.<br>
The endothelial cell specificity of the pro-apoptotic vector Ad-PPE-Fas- was demonstrated by infecting NSF (normal skin fibroblasts) with this vector. These cells, which express low levels of PPE-1 [Varda-Bloom, N. et al. Gene Ther 8, 819-27. (2001)] were not affected by infection with Ad-PPE-Fas-c. In contrast, the recombinant vector Ad-CMV-Fas-c induced apoptotic in these cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Co-administration of Ad-PPE-Fas-c receptor and TNFa ligand augments<br>
the pro-apoptotic effect in a selective manner<br>
The ability of TNFa to augment the apoptotic effect in Fas-c expressmg cells was investigated. Human TNFa was added to an endothelial cell culture 48h-post virus infection with Ad-PPE-Fas-c (MOI of 100). Cell viability was assayed 24 h later. As shown m Figure 8, TNFa (10ng/ml) induced a 73% decrease in viabilty of Ad-PPE-Fas-c infected cells, whereas no significant mortality was effected by TNFa alone or in cells infected with control virus (Ad-Luc).<br>
To substantiate the effect of TNFa, cell specificity was addressed. NSF (nonnal skm fibroblasts), DAS (mouse mammary adenocarcmoma), D122 (Lewis lung carcinoma) and B16 melanoma cells were infected with Ad-PPE-Fas-c or a control virus. 48 hours later, culture was supplemented with TNFa and cell morphology was assessed following staining with crystal violet. As shown in Figures 9a-e, non-endothelial cells mfected with Ad-PPE-Fas-c displayed normal appearance and were not affected by TNF. On<br><br>
the other hand, adenoviral mediated mfection of BAEC with Fas-c resulted in marked decrease in cell viability when TNF was added. The non-selective apoptotic activity of Fas-c driven by CMV promoter is demonstrated in Figure 10a which illustrates the TNF-dependent apoptotic effect of Ad-CMV-Fas-c on endothelial cells. Viability of BAEC cells infected with the indicated MOI of Ad-CMV-Fas-chimera was determined following incubation with TOF.<br>
Notably, the non-endothelial-specific vector Ad-CMV-Fas-c caused TNFa-dependent apoptosis of both endothelial and non-endothelial cells (Figures lOb-d).<br>
EXAMPLES Ad-PPEl-Fas-c induces in-vivo growth retardation ofB16 melanoma in<br>
mice<br>
The B16 melanoma mouse model was used in order to test the anti-tumoral effect of Fas-c expressed from the PPEl-3x promoter. B16 melanoma cells (8x10) were injected subcutaneously to the flank region of 40 C57bl/6 mice. When the tumor was palpable (~5x5 mm), the mice were randomized into 4 groups as follows: (i) control- saline injection; (ii) control virus (Adeno virus containing luciferase controlled by PPE promoter); (iii) Ad-PPEl-3x-Fas-c- virus containing the Fas -TNF receptor chimeric gene controlled by the preproendothelin (PPE) promoter; and (iv) Ad-CMV- Fas-c- virus containing the Fas -TNF receptor chimeric gene controlled by the non-endothelial specific, CMV promoter.<br>
Tumor size (length and width) was measured using a hand caliper. As shown in Figure 11a, tumor size was lower for mice treated with Ad-PPEl-3x-Fas-c or Ad-CMV-Fas-c as compared to control mice. Tumor weights at the end of the treatment period was also lower in the Ad-PPEl-3x-Fas-c treated mice (Figure lib). Mice injected with Ad-PPEl-3x-Fas-c showed marked necrosis of their tumor (Figure 1 Ic).<br><br>
