The benefit of the filing date of U.S. provisional patent<br>
applications Ser. Nos. 60/127,683. filed April 2 1999, and 60/143,975 filed<br>
July 15, 1999, is hereby claimed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119(e). The entire<br>
disclosure of the aforesaid provisional applications is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the<br>
treatment of cancer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Extracellular signals received attransmembrane receptors are<br>
relayed into the cells by the signal transduction pathways (Pelech et a/.,<br>
Science 257:1335 (1992)) which have been implicated in a wide array of<br>
physiological processes such as induction of cell proliferation,<br>
differentiation or apoptosis (Davis et a/., J. Biol. Chem. 268:14553 (1993)).<br>
The Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MARK) cascade is a major signaling<br>
system by which cells transduce extracellular cues into intracellular<br>
responses (Nishida et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:128 (1993); Blumer ef<br>
a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:236 (1994)). Many steps of this cascade are<br>
conserved, and homologous for MAP kinases have been discovered in<br>
different species.<br>
In mammalian cells, the Extracellular-Signal-Regulated<br>
Kinases (ERKs), ERK-1 and ERK-2 are the archetypal and best-studied<br>
members of the MARK family, which all have the unique feature of being<br>
activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by an<br>
upstream dual specificity kinase (Posada et a/., Science 255:212 (1992);<br>
Biggs III et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6295 (1992); Garner et a/.,<br>
Genes Dev. 6:1280(1992)).<br>
Recent studies have identified an additional subgroup of<br>
MAPKs, known as c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK-1 and JNK-2),<br>
that have different substrate specificities and are regulated by different<br>
stimuli (Hibi et a/., Genes Dev. 7:2135 (1993)). JNKs are members of the<br>
class of stress-activated protein kinases (SPKs). JNKs have been shown<br>
to be activated by treatment of cells with UV radiation, pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines and environmental stress (Derijard et a/., Cell 1025 (1994)). The<br>
activated JNK binds to the amino terminus of the c-Jun protein and<br>
increases the protein's transcriptional activity by phosphorylating it at ser63<br>
and ser73 (Adler et a/., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:5341 (1992); Kwok<br>
etal., Nature 370:223 (1994)).<br>
Analysis of the deduced primary sequence of the JNKs<br>
indicates that they are distantly related to ERKs (Davis, Trends Biochem.<br>
Sci. 19:470 (1994)). Both ERKs and JNKs are phosphorylated on Tyr and<br>
Thr in response to external stimuli resulting in their activation (Davis,<br>
Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). The phosphorylation (Thr and Tyr)<br>
sites, which play a critical role in their activation are conserved between<br>
ERKs and JNKs (Davis, Trends Biochem. Sci. 19:470 (1994)). However,<br>
these sites of phosphorylation are located within distinct dual<br>
phosphorylation motifs: Thr-Pro-Tyr (JNK) and Thr-Glu-Tyr (ERK).<br>
Phosphorylation of MAPKs and JNKs by an external signal often involves<br>
the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (Gille et a/., Nature<br>
358:414 (1992)), which constitute a large family of proteins encompassing<br>
several growth factor receptors and other signal transducing molecules.<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases are enzymes which catalyze a well<br>
defined chemical reaction: the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue<br>
(Hunter et a/., Annu Rev Biochetn 54:897 (1985)). Receptor tyrosine<br>
kinases in particular are attractive targets for drug design since blockers for<br>
the substrate domain of these kinases is likely to yield an effective and<br>
selective antiproliferative agent. The potential use of protein tyrosine<br>
kinase blockers as antiproliferative agents was recognized as early as<br>
1981, when quercetin was suggested as a PTK blocker (Graziani et a/.,<br>
Eur. J. Biochem. 135:583-589 (1983)).<br>
The best understood MARK pathway involves extracellular<br>
signal-regulated kinases which constitute the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase<br>
cascade (Boudewijn et a/., Trends Biochem. Sci. 20,18 (1995)). Once this<br>
pathway is activated by different stimuli, MARK phosphorylates a variety of<br>
proteins including several transcription factors which translocate into the<br>
nucleus and activate gene transcription. Negative regulation of this<br>
pathway could arrest the cascade of these events.<br>
What are needed are new anticancer chemotherapeutic<br>
agents which target receptor tyrosine kinases and which arrest the<br>
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. Oncoproteins in general, and signal<br>
transducing proteins in particular, are likely to be more selective targets for<br>
chemotherapy because they represent a subclass of proteins whose<br>
activities are essential for cell proliferation, and because their activities are<br>
greatly amplified in proliferative diseases.<br>
What is also needed are new anticancer therapeutics which<br>
are highly selective in the killing of tumor cells, but not normal cells.<br>

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, benzyl<br>
sulfones having the structural formula II or III, may be utilized as monomers<br>
in the synthesis of a new class of polymers having pendant benzylsulfone<br>
groups.<br>
The present invention also provides a series of substituted<br>
benzylsulfonyl acetic acid compounds having structural formula V, below.<br>
The substituted benzylsulfonyl acetic acid compounds are useful as<br>
intermediates in the synthesis of novel (E)-styryl benzylsulfone compounds<br>
of formula I, according to Method A, below.<br>
Detailed Description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, certain (E)-styryl<br>
benzylsulfone derivatives selectively kill various tumor cell types without<br>
killing normal cells. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is<br>
believed that the compounds affect the MARK signal transduction pathway,<br>
thereby affecting tumor cell growth and viability. This cell growth inhibition<br>
is associated with regulation of the ERK and JNK types of MARK. Without<br>
wishing to be bound by any theory, the styryl sulfones of the present<br>
invention may block the phosphorylating capacity of ERK-2.<br>
The compounds of the invention have been shown to inhibit<br>
the proliferation of tumor cells by inducing cell death. The compounds are<br>
believed effective against a broad range of tumor types, including but not<br>
limited to the following: breast, prostate, ovarian, lung, colorectal, brain (i.e.<br>
glioma) and renal. The compounds are also believed effective against<br>
leukemic cells. The compounds do not kill normal cells in concentrations<br>
at which tumor cells are killed.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of noncancer<br>
proliferative disorders, including but not limited to the following:<br>
hemangiomatosis in new born, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,<br>
chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis,<br>
ganlioneuromatosis, keloid formation, Pagets Disease of the bone,<br>
fibrocystic disease of the breast, Peronies and Duputren's fibrosis,<br>
restenosis and cirrhosis.<br>
Treatment of this broad range of tumor cells with the styryl<br>
benzylsulfone compounds of the invention leads to inhibition of cell<br>
proliferation and induction of apoptotic cell death. In breast tumors, the<br>
effect is observed for estrogen receptor (ER) positive as well as estrogen<br>
receptor negative cells.<br>
Tumor cells treated with the compounds of the invention<br>
accumulate in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. As the cells exit the.G2/M<br>
phase, they appear to undergo apoptosis. Treatment of normal cells with<br>
the styryl sulfones does not result in apoptosis.<br>
Synthesis of (E)- Stvrvl Benzvlsulfones<br>
The styryl benzyisulfones are characterized by cis-trans<br>
isomerism resulting from the presence of one or more double bonds. The<br>
compounds are named according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog system, the<br>
IUPAC 1974 Recommendations, Section E: Stereochemistry, in<br>
Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York,<br>
NY, 4th ed., 1992, p. 127-138. Stearic relations around a double bond are<br>
designated as "2" or "E".<br>
(E)-styryl benzylsulfones are prepared by Knoevenagel<br>
condensation of aromatic aldehydes with benzylsulfonyl acetic acids. The<br>
procedure is described by Reddy et at., Acta. Chim. Hung. 115:269 (1984);<br>
Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 13:83 (1991); Reddy et a/., Synthesis 322<br>
(1984); and Reddy et a/., Sulfur Letters 7:43 (1987), the entire disclosures<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The (E)-styryl benzylsulfones can be prepared according to<br>
either of the following Methods A and B:<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
METHOD A<br>
A benzyl thioacetic acid V formed by the reaction of sodium<br>
thioglycollate and a benzyl chloride IV. The benzyl thioacetic acid V is<br>
oxidized with 30% hydrogen peroxide to give a corresponding<br>
benzylsulfonyl acetic acid VI. Condensation of VI with an aromatic<br>
aldehyde VII via a Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of benzylamine<br>
and glacial acetic acid yields the (E)-styryl benzylsulfone I, II or III.<br>
METHOD B<br>
A benzylthioacetic acid V is formed by the reaction of the<br>
appropriate sodium benzylthioiate VIII with chloroacetic acid. Oxidation of<br>
V to the corresponding benzylsulfonyl acetic acid VI and subsequent<br>
Knoevenagel condensation with aldehyde VII is carried out as in Method<br>
A.<br>
Substituted benzylsulfonyl acetic acid compounds Va, Vb, Vc,<br>
and Vd according to formula V were prepared by reacting the<br>
corresponding benzyl chloride with thioglycollic acid under basic conditions<br>
(Method A). These compounds are novel intermediates.<br><br>
(Formula &amp; Table Removed)<br><br>
 (E)-Styryl benzylsulfones may be utilized as monomers in the<br>
synthesis of polymers X having pendant aryl and benzylsulfone groups.<br>
The polymerization of styryl benzylsulfones defined according to formula<br>
IX below into formula X polymers is accomplished by heating the formula<br>
IX compound above 250 °C in the presence of a free radical initiator. The<br>
initiator may comprise benzoyl peroxide, for example:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The degree of polymerization in the polymer of formula X, "x", may range<br>
from about 10 to about 150, providing an oligomeror polymer of from 5,000<br>
to 50,000 daltons. Otherdegrees of polymerization are also contemplated.<br>
R1, R2, R3, and R4 in the monomer of formula IX, and in the polymer of<br>
formula X, are independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen; halogen, i.e., fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo, most preferably<br>
fluoro, chloro and bromo; C1-C6 alkyl; C1-C6 alkoxy; nitro; cyano; and<br>
trifluoromethyl.<br>
The (E)-styryl benzylsulfones may be derivatized with a<br>
chemical group to permit conjugation to a carrier molecule, for the purpose<br>
of raising antibodies to the styryl sulfones. Suitable derivatizing chemistries<br>
are well-known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the derivative<br>
comprises a carboxylic acid derivative. The carrier may comprise any<br>
molecule sufficiently large to be capable of generating an immune<br>
response in an appropriate host animal. One such preferred carrier is<br>
keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH).<br>
Therapeutic Administration<br>
The (E)-styryl benzylsulfones of the invention may be<br>
administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, in combination<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The active ingredient in such<br>
formulations may comprise from 0.1 to 99.99 weight percent. By<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" is meant any carrier, diluent or<br>
excipient which is compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation<br>
and to deleterious to the.recipient.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be administered to<br>
individuals (mammals, including animals and humans) afflicted with cancer.<br>
The compounds are also useful in the treatment of non-cancer proliferative<br>
disorders, that is, proliferative disorders which are characterized by benign<br>
indications. Such disorders may also be known as "cytoproliferative" or<br>
"hyperproliferative" in that cells are made by the body at an atypically<br>
elevated rate. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
hemangiomatosis in new born, secondary progressive .multiple sclerosis,<br>
chronic progressive myelodegenerative disease, neurofibromatosis,<br>

The compounds may be administered by any route, including<br>
oral and parenteral administration. Parenteral administration includes, for<br>
example, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intraperitoneal,<br>
intranasal, rectal, intravaginal, topical or subcutaneous administration. The<br>
active agent is preferably administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier selected on the basis of the selected route of administration and<br>
standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
The active agent may be formulated into dosage forms<br>
according to standard practices in the field of pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
See Gennaro Alphonso, ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th<br>
Ed., (1990) Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA. Suitable dosage forms may<br>
comprise, for example, tablets, capsules, solutions, parenteral solutions,<br>
troches, suppositories, or suspensions.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agent may be mixed<br>
with a suitable carrier or diluent such as water, an oil (particularly a<br>
vegetable oil), ethanol, saline solution, aqueous dextrose (glucose) and<br>
related sugar solutions, glycerol, or a glycol such as propylene glycol or<br>
polyethylene glycol. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably<br>
contain a water soluble salt of the active agent. Stabilizing agents,<br>
antioxidizing agents and preservatives may also be added. Suitable<br>
antioxidizing agents include sulfite, ascorbic acid, citric acid and its salts,<br>
and sodium EDTA. Suitable preservatives include benzalkonium chloride,<br>
methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorbutanol. The composition for<br>
parenteral administration may take the form of an aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
solution, dispersion, suspension or emulsion.<br>
For oral administration, the active agent may be combined<br>
with one or more solid inactive ingredients for the preparation of tablets,<br>
capsules, pills, powders, granules or other suitable oral dosage forms. For<br>
example, the active agent may be combined with at least one excipient<br>
such as fillers, binders, humectants, disintegrating agents, solution<br>
retarders, absorption accelerators, wetting agents absorbents or lubricating<br>
agents. According to one tablet embodiment, the active agent may be<br>
combined with carboxymethylcellulose calcium, magnesium stearate,<br>
mannitol and starch, and then formed into tablets by conventional tab|eting<br>
methods.<br>
The specific dose of compound according to the invention to<br>
obtain therapeutic benefit will, of course, be determined by the particular<br>
circumstances of the individual patient including, the size, weight, age and<br>
sex of the patient, the nature and stage of the disease, the aggressiveness<br>
of the disease, and the route of administration. For example, a daily<br>
dosage of from about 0.05 to about 50 mg/kg/day may be utilized. Higher<br>
or lower doses are also contemplated.<br>
Examples<br>
General Procedure for Synthesis (E)-Styryl Benzylsulfones<br>
Part A. To a solution of (8g, 0.2 mol) sodium hydroxide in<br>
methanol (200 ml), thioglycollic acid (0.1 mol) is added slowly and the<br>
precipitate formed is dissolved by stirring the contents of the flask. Then<br>
an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted benzyl chloride (0.1 mol) is<br>
added stepwise and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2-3 hours. The<br>
cooled contents are poured onto crushed ice and neutralized with dilute<br>
hydrochloric acid (200 ml). The resulting corresponding benzylthioacetic<br>
acid (0.1 mol) is subjected to oxidation with 30% hydrogen peroxide (0.12<br>
mol) in glacial acetic acid (125 ml) by refluxing for 1 hour. The contents are<br>
cooled and poured onto crushed ice. The separated solid is recrystalized<br>
from hot water to give the corresponding pure benzylsulfonylacetic acid.<br>
Part B. A mixture of the benzylsulfonyl acetic acid (10 mmol),<br>
an appropriately substituted or unsubstituted aromatic aldehyde (10 mmol),<br>
and benzylamine (200 /J) in glacial acetic acid (12 ml) is refluxed for 2-3<br>
hours. The contents are cooled and treated with cold ether (50 ml). Any<br>
product precipitated out is separated by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with<br>
more ether and washed successively with a saturated solution of sodium<br>
bicarbonate (20 ml), sodium bisulfite (20 ml), dilute hydrochloric acid (20<br>
ml) and finally with water (35 ml). Evaporation of the dried ethereal layer<br>
yields styryl benzylsulfones as a solid material.<br>
In each of the following examples, the substituted<br>
benzylsulfonyl acetic acid was made according to Part A of the General<br>
Procedure. All the styryl benzylsulfone compounds were recrystalized from<br>
2-propanol and the purity was checked by thin layer chromatography.<br>

A carboxylic acid derivative of (E)-4-fluorostyryl 4-<br>
chlorobenzylsulfone was synthesized by mixing 4-chlorobenzyl sulfonyl<br>
acetic acid (10 mmol), 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (10mmol), glacial acetic acid<br>
(15 ml) and piperidine (0.5 ml) at room temperature (22°C) over a magnetic<br>
stirrer for 5 hours. The mixture was then diluted with ether and the ethereal<br>
layer was washed with water. Evaporation of the ethereal layer yielded a<br>
semisolid material which on treating with 2-propanol gave a white solid.<br>
Recrystallization with 2-propanol gave 2-(4-chlorobenzyl sulfony)-3-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl) propenoic acid as white crystals, (yield 32%), m.p 111 -112°C.<br>
The above carboxylic acid derivative (10 mM) was made into an<br>
active ester by treatment with 10 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 10 mM Nhydroxysuccinamide<br>
(NHS), and then cross-linked to KLH by mixing with 1<br>
ml of a KLH water solution containing 500 mg KLH. The mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 5-6 hours. The KLH conjugate was then<br>
separated by passing the mixture through a size exclusion column (PD 10,<br>
Pharmacia). The conjugate was then used to inject rabbits for raising<br>
antibodies.<br>
