PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a roller bearing of a false friction twisting device , a drive element for a roller bearing and a clamping sleeve for a roller bearing .<br>
In order to load smooth, structureless filament yarns with textile properties, such as crimping, bulkiness, stretching ability or elasticity, or to increase these properties in yarns, texturing methods are used.<br>
The twist-untwist texturing or false twist method belongs, inter alia to the texturing methods. DE 40 28 093 Al describes a false friction twister, which is used for false twisting, in particular, synthetic threads in false twist crimping machines. The false friction twister comprises three parallel shafts, which are mounted so as to rotate in a frame by means of ball bearings and the axes of which are arranged in the corner points of an equilateral triangle. A wharve, over which a drive belt is guided to drive this shaft is seated at the end on a first shaft. The rotational movement from the first shaft thus acting as the driving shaft is transmitted to the two other shafts by drive belts configured as toothed belts, which are guided over toothed belt discs of the shafts. Furthermore, the false friction twister has groups of discs, which are connected in a frictional or positive manner to the shafts. The shaft spacings and the disc diameters are designed such that the respectively cooperating discs overlap. A so-called overlapping triangle with arc of a circle-shaped sides is formed by the overlapping. Between the sides of this triangle, the thread is tensioned in its course through the false twister between the disc groups to form a helical line and is thus acted upon with the desired property.<br><br>
The shaft acting as the driving shaft and the two further driven shafts in each case have different lengths depending on their drive function. In this case, the driving shaft has the longest length of the three shafts.<br>
Shafts of texturing devices are inclined, from a certain rotational speed, to oscillate. A solution to this problem is provided in that the shaft, in a double-row roller bearing, is resiliently mounted in the radial direction, at least in the region of one bearing row. DE 198 30 393 CI shows a sleeve for receiving a double-row roller bearing, in particular for texturing devices, which has a different rigidity in the regions of the two bearing rows in the radial direction. On its inside, the sleeve has a resilient inner sheath. DE 198 30 393 CI shows a shaft, which acts as a driving shaft. For this purpose, fastened at the end of the shaft, is a toothed belt disc to drive the further shafts of the texturing device and a wharve to drive the shaft by means of a flat driving belt.<br>
The variants, which are produced by driving shafts and driven shafts, by a machine-side drive with flat drive belts for a joint drive or toothed belts for an individual drive and by resilient clamping or rigid clamping of the roller bearings, lead to a considerable diversity of type of the bearing arrangements in texturing devices. The diversity of types specifically affects the main components of the roller bearing here such as the shafts and the outer rings. Depending on the type of drive provided and the rotational operating speed provided of the texturing device, assembly or even the manufacturing of individual components of the roller bearing is only carried out when these criteria are present.<br>
The production of the various bearing shaft designs is time-consuming. The bearing shafts require a resistant coating to prevent oscillation corrosion, which is generally implemented as a chrome plating. The surface treatment is generally carried out externally by specialist concerns. This leads to the extension of the throughput time of a manufacturing batch not only owing to the surface treatment itself, but also<br><br>
owing to the transport distances or times. The desire for shorter delivery times for the specific design of the respective order can therefore not or not always be met, depending on the number of units.<br>
If stockpiling is carried out or the number of units of the stocked components is increased such that even delivery requests for relatively large numbers of units can be met at short notice, this leads to a relatively high capital commitment and relatively high storage costs, so the overall costs increase. The delivery times then substantially depend on the assembly period, based on the respectively required variant of the shaft. The storing of preassembled roller bearing arrangements leads to an additional increase in costs, as capital commitment and bearing costs are further increased thereby.<br>
The object of the invention is to achieve an economical shortening of the delivery time of roller bearings for false friction twisting devices.<br>
The object is achieved with a roller bearing according to claim 1.<br>
The sub-claims are directed at advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br>
The roller bearing to be completed from base elements for all types of variants including the bearing shaft with a unified length is suitable both for rigid and also for resilient installation and comprises all the components required for bearing sealing, for lubrication and for fastening the texturing discs. Only with the adding of the respective clamping sleeve and the respective drive element is the roller bearing restricted to one variant type. These remaining assembly steps for completing the roller bearing are not very costly and can be carried out quickly and easily.<br>
With the reduction in the number of bearing shaft lengths required for the variants of the roller bearings from three to one roller bearing length, the number of one of<br><br>
the main components to be stocked is significantly reduced. As only a single length of bearing shaft is now required, base elements of the roller bearing can be preassembled on this bearing shaft, which can be used for all type variants. Thus, either a significant reduction in the storage can be achieved with the same delivery capacity with regard to a certain type variant or an increase in the delivery capacity can be achieved as all the stocked roller bearing devices preassembled from the base elements can be used for any delivery order. Delivery capacity here is taken to mean the capacity to deliver a specific number of units.<br>
A clamping sleeve configured as a rigid element is a very simple component which is economical to produce for use in the lower rotational speed range of the bearing shaft.<br>
In the upper rotational speed range, as a function of the geometrical dimensions of the bearing shaft and the equipping of the bearing shaft with texturing discs and spacer sleeves, oscillations may occur when the natural frequency of the roller bearing is in the rotational speed range. A resilient clamping sleeve counteracts oscillations of this type. The elastic clamping sleeve can be used both in the lower and in the upper rotational speed range, in other words universally.<br>
In a driving bearing shaft, the drive element for the machine-side drive of the driving bearing shaft and the drive element for the driven bearing shafts are advantageously combined to form a one-piece drive element. In this manner, manufacturing and assembly outlay can be reduced. A configuration of this type improves the secure seat of the drive element on the bearing shaft end.<br>
A configuration according to claim 5 ensures a precise, slip-free drive of the driving bearing shaft. A belt winding cone according to claim 6 facilitates the assembly of the drive belt.<br><br>
An embodiment of the drive element according to claim 7 is suitable for a drive by means of a tangential flat belt, which drives a large number of texturing devices together.<br>
A drive element according to any one of claims 8 to 10 can be produced economically in mass production.<br>
With a shaped portion at the head end of the drive element, which can be designed, for example, as a multi-sided socket or as a slot, the drive element and therefore the bearing shaft can be acted upon by a torque, which is used for support when tightening the disc clamping element at the opposite end of the bearing shaft. The disc clamping element may be a cylinder head screw with a plain washer, as known, for example from DE 40 28 093 Al. The shaped portion is formed without an additional work operation when producing the configurations according to any one of claims 8 to 10, by a corresponding design of the form tool. A conventional commercial tool, such as screwdriver or an Allen key can be introduced into the shaped portion for support when tightening the disc clamping element. The introduction, for example of a slot, into the bearing shaft end in a separate work operation is no longer necessary. A production process is thus saved.<br>
If the clamping element is configured according to claim 12 and provided with axial, channel-like recesses in the region of the upper bearing support, this allows precise matching of the radial rigidity, in particular, when the rigidity only has to be slight. <br>
Further details of the invention are described with the aid of the figures, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a roller bearing made of base elements, in section,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a sectional view of the roller bearing of Fig. 1 with a driven bearing shaft, which is completed by a rigid clamping sleeve and a drive element,<br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a sectional view of the roller bearing of Fig. 1 with a driven bearing shaft, which is completed by a resilient clamping sleeve and a drive element,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a sectional view of the roller bearing of Fig. 1 with a driving bearing shaft, which is completed by a resilient clamping sleeve and a drive element for machine-side drive by means of a toothed belt,<br>
Fig, 5 shows a sectional view of the roller bearing of Fig. 1 with a driving bearing shaft, which is completed with a resilient clamping sleeve and a drive element for machine-side drive by means of a flat belt,<br>
Fig. 6 shows the clamping sleeve of Figs. 3 to 5 in an enlarged perspective view.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the bearing shaft 1 as part of a roller bearing consisting of base elements 2. The roller bearing is in turn part of a texturing device. The roller bearirtg comprises base elements 2 which form a double-row bearing arrangement with shaft ends projecting on either side, the bearing shaft 1 being set up on the left-hand side in the view of Fig. 1 to receive texturing discs and spacer sleeves and a drive element of the bearing arrangement being arranged on the other shaft side.<br>
The roller bearing made of base elements 2 also comprises two rows 3, 4 of balls, the balls 5, 6 of which in each case revolve in a track 7, 8 introduced into the bearing shaft 1. The balls 5, 6 are held and guided with the aid of two ball cages 9,10 at a constant spacing. The bearing shaft 1 is rotatably mounted in the bearing sleeve 11 by means of the rows 3, 4 of balls. The interior of the roller bearing formed between the bearing shaft 1 and bearing sleeve 11, made of base elements 2, is sealed in each case at the end with respect to the environment by the seals 12, 13. The bearing sleeve 11 has a relubrication opening 14, through which grease can be introduced for relubrication. The grease is distributed in the interior of the roller bearing by means<br><br>
of a grease shoe 15, which is held in its position by the bearing sleeve 11. The seal 13 is separated from the region of the bearing shaft 1 by a stop ring 16, which is configured to receive the texturing discs and the spacer sleeves.<br>
The roller bearing shown in Fig. 2, apart from the base elements 2, comprises a rigid clamping sleeve 17 and a drive element 18 for driving the bearing shaft 1 by means of a toothed belt, not shown. The rigid clamping sleeve 17 has a relubrication bore 19, which allows access to the relubkation opening 14 or the bearing sleeve 11. The drive element 18, which is configured as a toothed belt disc and has a hexagonal socket 21 on the end, is placed on the right-hand free shaft end 20 of the bearing shaft 1 in the view of Fig. 2. On the other end, the bearing shaft 1 has mounted texturing discs, of which one disc 41 is shown. The disc 41, like the discs not shown, is fixed by means of spacer sleeves 42, a plain washer 43 and screw 44 on the bearing shaft 1.<br>
During assembly of the texturing discs and the spacer sleeves, an Allen key is introduced into the hexagon socket 21. The drive element 18 and therefore the bearing shaft 1 are acted upon by a torque by means of this Allen key. This torque counteracts the torque which is applied at the other shaft end 22 to tighten a screw to hold the texturing discs and the spacer sleeves. The threaded bore 23 at the shaft end 22 is used to receive the screw. The texturing discs and spacer sleeves can be held between the screw and plain washer on one side and the stop ring 16 on the other side. Threaded bores of this type and screws and plain washers to hold texturing discs and spacer sleeves on the bearing shaft are known, for example, from DE 198 30 393 CI and DE 40 28 093 At<br>
The roller bearing of Fig. 3, in contrast to the roller bearing of Fig. 2, instead of the rigid clamping sleeve 17, has a resilient clamping sleeve 24. The bearing shaft 1 is driven, as in the roller bearing of Fig. 2, by means of the drive element 18 placed on the shaft end 20. The clamping sleeve 24 has a metallic sleeve 25 on the outside and a<br><br>
resilient inner sheath 26 made of rubber on the inside. The clamping sleeve 24 comprises a relubrication bore 27 as an access to the relubication opening 14 of the bearing sleeve 11.<br>
A reinforcing ring 28 made of metal or plastics material is vulcanised into the resilient inner sheath 26 of the clamping sleeve 24. The bearing sleeve 11 is positioned in the region of the reinforcing ring 28 by means of a press fit. Alternatively, instead of a press fit, a sliding fit with adhesion can be selected. At its other end, the resilient inner sheath 26 has axially extending recesses 29, as shown in Fig. 6. The radial rigidity and therefore the radial damping behaviour can be selected depending on the configuration of the reinforcing ring 28 and the recesses 29. Roller bearings equipped with a resilient clamping sleeve 24 of this type are necessary for use in the upper supercritical rotational speed range.<br>
The roller bearing 1 is shown in Fig. 3 and also in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 for reasons of simplification, as in the shaft shown in DE 198 30 393 CI, without mounted texturing discs and spacer sleeves. A known texturing device, in which texturing discs mounted on shafts are shown is described in DE 40 28 093 Al.<br>
Fig 4 shows a roller bearing which, in contrast to the roller bearing of Fig. 3, has the drive element 30 instead of the drive element 18. The bearing shaft 1 configured as the driving shaft can be driven on the machine side and is set up in turn to drive the two other bearing shafts of the texturing device. The machine-side drive takes place by a single motor by means of a toothed belt. The toothed belt cooperates with a part of the drive element 30, which is configured as a toothed belt disc 31. To facilitate the pulling up of the toothed belt during production of the toothed belt connection, the drive element 30 has a belt winding cone 32.<br>
The drive element 30, apart from the toothed belt disc 31, comprises a further part configured as a toothed belt disc 33 for driving the two other bearing shafts of the<br><br>
texturing device. Roller bearings with driven bearing shafts are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. For support when tightening the screws during assembly of the texturing discs and the spacer sleeves, the drive element 30 has a hexagon socket 34. The drive element 30 is formed in one piece from plastics material. The drive element 30 can be configured as an injection moulding, a sintered part or as an extruded part.<br>
In contrast to the roller bearing of Fig. 4, the roller bearing of Fig. 5 shows, instead of the drive element 30, which is designed for drive by a separate motor, a drive element 35 with a wharve 36, which is configured for machine-side drive by means of a flat drive belt. The drive element 35 is placed on the shaft end 20 of the bearing shaft 1 acting as the driving shaft. Drives of this type by means of flat drive belts are used for the joint drive of a plurality of texturing devices, in other words to drive a plurality of driving bearing shafts. The drive element 35, like the drive element 30, comprises a part configured as a toothed belt drive 37 to drive the two other only driven bearing shafts of the texturing device and a hexagon socket 38. The hexagon socket 38 is used, as already explained above, for support during assembly of the texturing discs and the spacer sleeves.<br>
Fig. 6 shows the clamping sleeve 34 in a perspective view enlarged compared to Figs. 3 to 5 in order to make clearly visible the shape of the recesses 29 in the elastic inner sheath 26 of the clamping sleeve 24. The recesses 29 are only arranged at one head end and have a predetermined length. The recesses 29 are configured to be of a length such that they extend into the region of the balls 6 of the row 4 of balls in the assembled state of the clamping sleeve 24. Support faces 39 remain between the recesses 29 of the inner sleeve 26. In the assembled state, the cylindrical inner sleeve 26, which consists of rubber, is surrounded by the metallic sleeve 25 and rests with the support faces 39 and a part of the inner face 40 on the bearing sleeve 11, which is the outer element of the base elements 2. A reinforcing ring 28, which also rests on the bearing sleeve 11, is vulcanised in, not visible in Fig. 6, on the end of the clamping sleeve 24 opposing the recesses 29. In this manner, the rows 3 and 4 of<br><br>
balls are mounted with different rigidity in the sleeve 25. Depending on the application, the recess 29 can be configured such that a precise matching of the radial rigidity of this bearing side is possible, in particular when a low rigidity is required.<br>
Further supplementary information on texturing devices can be found in DE 40 28 093 Al or DE 198 30 393 CI.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the embodiments shown. In the scope of the invention, for example, the drive element 30 or the drive element 35 may be composed of two individual parts to form a preassembled component, which is pushed onto the bearing shaft. The costs for the production of a form tool can thus be reduced.<br><br>
