DESCRIPTION<br>
Voltage limiter<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention is based on a voltage limiter as claimed in the precharacterizing clause of patent claim 1. This voltage limiter is used to limit short-term or long-term overvoltages. The voltage limiter has a varistor and a discharge path which can be connected in parallel with the varistor. In the event of long-lasting overvoltages, a switching point which is provided in the discharge path is operated, and commutates a current, which is carried in the varistor when limiting overvoltages, into the discharge path.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The precharacterizing clause of the invention refers to a prior art for voltage limiters as is described in US 4,068,281 A. The described limiting apparatus has a varistor 10, in parallel with which a discharge path with a semiconductor switch 16 is connected. When a long-lasting overvoltage occurs, the varistor carries current which, after a time delay which can be predetermined, is commutated into the discharge path by short-circuiting the semiconductor switch. The short circuit is achieved via an NTC thermistor 15, v;hich switches on the semiconductor switch as a function of the varistor temperature after the time delay has elapsed.<br>
A further voltage limiter is disclosed in FR 2,716,307 A. Figure 2 of this document illustrates a voltage limiter with a spark gap 2, in parallel with which a discharge path with a semiconductor switch 8 is connected.  A  variable  which  is  dependent  on  the<br><br>
operation of the spark gap 2,  namely the voltage, across the spark gap, is detected by a control device 9 and is used to short-circuit the semiconductor switch after a predetermined time interval.<br>
A voltage limiter having a number of voltage-limiting elements is described in DE 41 24 321 Al, If one of these elements is overloaded during operation, then a switching operation takes place from this element to a next voltage-limiting element. Since the connected voltage-limiting element is likewise quickly overloaded in the event of long-term overvoltages, this limiter is not suitable for long-lasting overvoltages.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, as it is defined in the patent claims, achieves the object of specifying a voltage limiter of the type mentioned initially, which is distinguished by a compact construction and by high reliability even in severe operating conditions.<br>
The voltage limiter according to the invention has an axially symmetrical housing with at least two areas, which are at a distance from one another in the axial direction, and of which the varistor is arranged in a first and the switching point is arranged in the second. It also contains a third area, which is at a defined potential and in which means for operating the switching point are accommodated. The arrangement of the components of the voltage limiter in separate areas results in a compact, modular construction. At the same time, this ensures that those components of the voltage limiter which are subject to power loading, namely the varistor and the switching point, are physically separated from one another, and can thus be cooled independently of one another. Since the operating means,  which  generally  operate  electronically,  are<br><br>
accommodated in an electromagnetically shielded area, the operational reliability of the voltage limiter is improved to a very major extent. In this way, in particular, undesirable high-energy electromagetic interference is kept away from this area.<br>
A particularly compact construction with particularly good electromagnetic compatibility at the same time is achieved if the third area is arranged between the first area and the second area and contains a control device as the operating means with inputs for at least one signal, which is dependent on an operating variable, and for further signals which are dependent on the operating variables and may be provided, having a trigger unit which checks switching conditions and produces a switching signal, an output which acts on the switching point, a signal processing unit which processes the signals which are dependent on an operating variable, and/or an amplifier which amplifies the switching signals. A control device such as this makes it possible to monitor the formation of the switching signal very accurately, independently of disturbing electromagnetic interference fields. The processing of the supplied signals in the signal processing unit and/or the amplification of the switching signal in the amplifier allow/allows the accuracy of the process to be additionally improved. A further improvement is achieved by inputs for additional, preferably external, input signals and by electronics or computation unit, integrated in the trigger unit, for linking the signals which are dependent on an operating variable and the additional input signals in accordance with a control algorithm which is determined by the switching conditions. A voltage limiter such as this may be used particularly advantageously for railroad operation, since, despite the occurrence of severe interference fields there, extremely  accurate  and  reliable  operation  of  the<br><br>
voltage  limiter  is  required  even  for  carrying  out complex limiting tasks.<br>
The operating variable is, in particular, a current carried by the varistor, the magnetic field of this current, a residual voltage which is present across the varistor and/or the temperature of the varistor. If the residual voltage is chosen as the operating variable, the control apparatus has a trigger element which can be activated above a limit value of the residual voltage and is in the form of a voltage divider or voltage limiter, if the varistor current or its magnetic field is chosen as the operating variable, the control apparatus has a trigger element which can be activated above a limit value of the current or of the magnetic field and is in the form of a switch which is dependent on the current density or magnetic field strength, if the varistor temperature is chosen as the operating variable, the control apparatus has a trigger element which can be activated above a temperature limit value and is in the form of a temperature-dependent switch.<br>
The first area and the second area are arranged in a physically simple manner between in each case two of four current-carrying plates, which are at an axial distance from one another and are aligned at right angles to the axis of symmetry. Here, two outer plates each form one of two current connections of the arrangement, and two inner plates, located between them, are electrically isolated from one another an^ are each electrically conductively connected to one of the two current connections of the arrangement and to one of two current connections of the varistor and of the switching point. If, now, a first of the two outer plates and a first of the two inner plates are braced with respect to one another in an electrically conductive manner by means  of  first  screws,  and a<br><br>
second inner plate, which is arranged between the first outer plate and the first inner plate, and a second of the outer plates are braced with respect to one another in an electrically conductive manner by means of second screws, then highly effective protection against external mechanical influences can be achieved using supporting elements which already exist in the limiter housing, without additional holding parts.<br>
The first screws are expediently passed through openings in the second inner plate, and the second screws are passed through openings in the first inner plate, which openings are larger than the screws. A voltage limiter designed in this way can be produced particularly easily, since its parts which can carry different electrical potentials can easily be electrically isolated from one another. Flat insulation is used as the insulation means, which is provided between one of the two outer plates and one of the two inner plates, and insulation which embeds the two inner plates and extends between the two outer plates, which is advantageously formed by a cured encapsulation compound.<br>
The electrically and magnetically shielded third area is preferably bounded by the first inner plate and by an intermediate plate which is kept at its electrical potential and is electrically conductively connected to a current connection of the varistor. The third area, which contains the operating .means, is then particularly effectively protected against electromagnetic influences by being in the form of a Faraday cage-<br>
Major assistance to the assembly of the voltage limiter is provided by introducing a centering pin, which is passed into the second area, into the first inner plate. This centering pin holds the switching point.<br><br>
which generally has at least one power semiconductor, in a defined position during manufacture of the voltage limiter and after its production.<br>

APPROACHES TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Identical parts are provided with the same reference symbols in the figures. The voltage limiter which is<br><br>
illustrated in Figure 1 has a voltage-limiting element,<br>
Which is in the form of varistor 1 and preferably<br>
contains metal oxide,  in particular zinc oxide.  The<br>
varistor 1 is connected in parallel with a path to<br>
which overvoltages  U can be  applied and which  is<br>
bounded by two current connections 2, 3, which may be<br>
of different potentials. The two current connections<br>
may be part of one electrical system, but may also each<br>
be  associated with one of two different electrical<br>
systems, for example with a rail of an electrical track<br>
carrying a return current,  and a low-voltage system<br>
arranged in the vicinity of the track, for example an<br>
automatic ticket machine. The current connection 2 is<br>
electrically conductively connected to one of the two<br>
current connections of the varistor 1, and to one of<br>
the two current connections of the switching point 4,<br>
which is arranged in a discharge path connected in<br>
parallel with the varistor 1. The current connection 3<br>
and the other of the two current connections of the<br>
varistor 1 and switching point 4 are each at the same<br>
potential. Means which cause the switching point to be<br>
operated, in particular to be switched on, are located<br>
between the varistor and the switching point. These<br>
operating  means  comprise  sensors,  which  are  not<br>
identified, for detection of operating variables of the<br>
varistor, and a control device 5 to which the output<br>
signals from the sensors are supplied, and which acts<br>
on the switching point 4. Operating variables such as<br>
these include all measurement variables which make it<br>
possible to identify that the varistor is overloaded,<br>
in particular such as a current Iv which is carried in<br>
the varistor 1 and can be detected by a current sensor,<br>
the magnetic field H of this current,  which can be<br>
detected by a magnetic field sensor, a residual voltage<br>
UR which is present across the varistor 1,  and the<br>
temperature Tv of the varistor 1, which can be detected<br>
by a temperature sensor.  Only one of the operating<br>
variables may act on the switching point 4 . However, in<br><br>
order to improve the redundancy, it may be expedient to allow two or more of the operating variables to act on the switching point 4. Depending on the embodiment, the sensors may be integrated in the control device 5.<br>
The control device 5 has inputs 6 for the signals Iv, UR, TV and H which are emitted from the sensors and are dependent on an operating variable, and for further signals which are dependent on an operating variable and which may be provided. Such further signals are a current I caused by the overvoltage U and a current Is carried in the discharge path and in the switching point 4, which is added to the varistor current ly to form the total current I caused by the overvoltage. Inputs are also provided for additional signals from external control lines. The input signals can be processed in a signal processing unit 7 of the control device 5. A switching-on signal for the switching point is formed from the processed signals in a trigger unit 8, while checking predetermined tripping conditions directly or indirectly with the aid of an algorithm which assesses the processed input signals in a computation unit or in electronics. The switching signal may be amplified in an amplifier 9, and may be passed to a control element for the switching point 4, via one output of the control device 5.<br>
The switching point 4 may be in the form of an electromechanical switching device, but will in general have a semiconductor switch containing power semiconductors. Suitable power semiconductors are in the form of thyristors, triacs transistors, IGBTs, GTOs, MOSFETs or FETs. The individual power semiconductor types differ in their load capacity (overload behavior, voltage load, maximum permissible current rate of rise) and the trigger methods. Each semiconductor type thus has different advantages for specific applications, so that the optimum type can be<br><br>
evaluated on the basis of the application. Depending on Which power semiconductor is used, type-specific protection circuits (for example a surge suppressor protection circuit for a thyristor) and disconnection circuits (for example a commutation aid circuit for a thyristor) may be integrated. For alternating current applications, the semiconductor switch is in general designed to be bidirectional and contains two identical power semiconductors which are connected back-to-back in parallel while, in contrast, for direct current applications, only one power semiconductor or two or more power semiconductors in the same polarity are used.<br>
An overvoltage which lasts for only a short time and whose energy content is low is limited by the varistor 1. A long-term overvoltage with a high energy content is likewise initially limited by the varistor 1. Before the load on the varistor becomes too great, a switching signal is formed in the control device 5 above a limit value of at least one signal which is dependent on one of the operating variables Iv, UR, TV, H of the varistor, and this switching signal short-circuits the switching point, whose uninterrupted current load capacity is greater than that of the varistor, provided that the signal which is dependent on an operating variable is still above the limit value after a predetermined time interval.<br>
This principle will be explained with reference to Figures 2 and 3 for a voltage limiter according to the invention, in which the residual voltage UR which corresponds to the overvoltage, across the varistor is used as the operating variable for controlling the switching point 4. The control device 5, which is connected firstly to that current connection of the varistor 1 which carries the residual voltage UR and , secondly to the control element of the switching point<br><br>
4, of this voltage limiter has, connected in series with it, a trigger element 10 and a time delay element 11 with a time delay which acts over a time interval<br>
td.<br>
When a short-term overvoltage occurs (left-hand part of Figure 3), then the varistor 1 becomes conductive when the overvoltage is greater than a predetermined value Uc, and then carries a current Iv- If the overvoltage exceeds a further predetermined voltage value UT^ then the trigger element 10 emits a trigger signal, and the time delay element 11 is activated at the same time. If the overvoltage U falls below the value UT once again within the time interval td, then the trigger signal disappears once again during this time interval. The overvoltage is then limited exclusively by the varistor 1, without any risk of overloading. If, on the other hand, this is an overvoltage which acts for a long time and may rise slowly (right-hand part of Figure 3), then the trigger signal which is emitted by the trigger element 10 is maintained over the entire time interval td- Once this time interval has elapsed, the trigger signal passes via the time delay element 11 as a switching signal to the switching point 4, and closes the switching point 4, forming a discharge path. The current Iv carried in the varistor 1 is now commutated into the discharge path containing the switching point 4. Since the switching point 4 is designed to be resistant to uninterrupted currents, it can carry the current for a long time interval without being heated to an unacceptable extent. Nevertheless, any excess heat which may occur can be dissipated via cooling elements that are additionally provided.<br>
In the embodiment of the voltage limiter which is shown in Figure 4, the residual voltage UR of the varistor 1 is used to control the switching point 4, which is in the form of bidirectional switches with two back-to-<br><br>
back parallel-connected thyristors T1 and T2. During the positive half-cycle of the residual voltage, the residual voltage UR of the varistor 1 is detected via a diode D by a voltage divider which is connected in parallel with the current connections of the varistor 1 and has non-reactive resistors R1 and R2 for electronics El of the control circuit 5. During the positive half-cycle of the residual voltage, the residual voltage, which is reduced by the division factor of the voltage divider, is supplied via a diac DI and a non-reactive resistor R3 to the gate connection of the thyristor T1. An energy storage capacitor CT for the electronics Ei, which is connected in parallel with the resistor R2, is then charged. If the residual voltage is still present after the time interval td (Figure 3) , then the capacitor CT is charged to a voltage which is sufficient to activate the diac and to carry current from the capacitor CT via the resistor R3 to the gate electrode of the thyristor T1. The gate current is limited by the resistor R3 and causes the thyristor Ti to be triggered, thus reducing the load on the varistor 1 which is connected parallel with the thyristor T2.<br>
The electronics E2, which can be seen in Figure 4, are designed in a corresponding manner to the electronics El and, during the negative half-cycle of the residual voltage, cause a capacitor which corresponds to the capacitor CT to be charged and, if the residual voltage is still present after the time interval ta, cause the thyristor T2 to be triggered. An RC circuit, which is normal for thyristors and is not identified in any more detail, protects the thyristors T1 and T2 against being overloaded.<br>
The embodiment of the voltage converter as shown in Figure 5, which is intended for direct current applications, also uses the residual voltage UR of the varistor  1  to  control  the  switching  point.  The<br><br>
switching point is in the form of a thyristor T. The gate electrode of the thyristor T is driven by the residual voltage via a zener diode ZD and a series circuit, which is thus connected in series with it and is formed by a non-reactive resistor RT and a capacitance CT, A signal is passed to the thyristor T only when the zener diode ZD is conducting above the voltage value UT (Figure 3) and still remains conducting, as well, after a time delay which is governed by the RC element. A protection inductor LK ensures that the rise in the current Is through the switching point takes place in a controlled manner while the varistor current Iv is being commutated from the varistor 1 into the discharge path. The thyristor T is thus protected against excessively high current rates of change.<br>
In the embodiment as shown in Figure 6, which is intended for alternating current applications, the switching point 4 is once again in the form of a thyristor arrangement with two thyristors T1 and T2 connected back-to-back in parallel- Each of these two thyristors is connected, in a corresponding way to the thyristor T in the embodiment shown in Figure 4, to the zener diode ZD and to the RC element. Two back-to-back parallel-connected diodes D, which are each connected upstream of one of the two zener diodes, ensure that only one haIf-cycle of the signal which corresponds to the residual voltage UR is in each case passed on to zener diode ZD.<br>
In the embodiments shown in Figures 7 to 10, and in contrast to the embodiments shown in Figures 2, 4, 5 and 6, the varistor current Iv and the temperature Tv of the varistor are used as the operating variables for operating the switching point 4. Instead of the zener diode ZD, a switch S1 which can be activated above a limit value of the current or of the magnetic field and<br><br>
is dependent on the current density or magnetic field strength, and a temperature-dependent switch ST which can be activated above a limit value of the temperature Tv, are now provided as the trigger element. In the embodiments shown in Figures 7 and 9, which are intended for direct current applications, a thyristor T and an IGBT, respectively, are provided as the switching point 4. In the embodiments shown in Figures 8 and 10, which are intended for alternating current applications, an arrangement with two back-to-back parallel-connected thyristors T1 and T2 and an arrangement with two back-to-back parallel-connected insulated gate bipolar junction transistors (IGBT) are provided as the switching point 4 . In the embodiments shown in Figures 9 and 10, with a switching point 4 containing at least one IGBT, there is no need for the protection inductor LK.<br>
If one of the two switches S1 or ST is closed in response to a limit value of the varistor current Iv or of the varistor temperature Tv being exceeded, then a tripping signal is passed to the switching point 4. Since two operating variables which act independently of one another are used to form the tripping signal, the redundancy of the voltage limiter is increased.<br>
Figures 11 to 13 show a hardware embodiment of the voltage limiter as shown in one of the Figures 4, 6, 8 or 10, which is intended to accept high power levels. Figures 11 and 12 do not show the insulation. As can be seen, the voltage limiter has a housing 22 which is axially symmetrical along an axis 20 and has two areas 24 and 26 (Figures 12 and 13), which are at a distance from one another in the axial direction and of which the varistor 1, which is in the form of a flat circular disk, is arranged in a first area 24, while the switching point 4, which has two completely cylindrical thyristors T1 and T2, is arranged in the second 26. The<br><br>
operating means, which comprise the control device 5, are accommodated in a third area 28 (Figure 3) , which is electromagnetically shielded and is at a defined potential.  This third area is arranged between  the varistor area 24 and the switching point area 26.<br>
It can be seen from Figures 12 and 13 that the areas 24 and 26 are arranged between in each case two electrically conductive plates 30, 32, 34, 36 which are axially at a distance from one another, are aligned at right angles to the axis of symmetry 20, and are of a round circular design. These plates are composed of a material with a high electrical conductivity, such as aluminum, brass or copper, of an alloy containing at least one of these elements, or of steel. Two outer plates of these plates, namely the plates 30 and 36, have a larger diameter than the two inner plates 32 and 34, and each form one of the two current connections of the voltage limiter. The inner plates 32 and 34 located in between them are electrically isolated from one another, and are each electrically conductively connected to one of the two current connections of the arrangement, and to one of two current connections of the varistor 1 and of the switching point 4. The plates 30 and 34 are braced with respect to one another in an electrically conductive manner by means of three screws 38, and the plate 32, which is arranged between these two plates and the plate 36 are braced with respect to one another in an electrically conductive manner by means of three screws 39. The screws 38 are passed through openings, which are not identified, in the plate 32, and the screws 39 are passed through openings, which are not identified, in the plate 34, which openings are larger than the screws.<br>
The area 28 is bounded by the plate 34, a metallic hollow cylinder 42 which is based on the plate 34, and an electrically conductive intermediate plate 44, which<br><br>
is supported on the hollow cylinder 42 and forms a current connection of the varistor 1. Since the plate 34; the cylinder 4 2 and the intermediate plate 4 4 are electrically conductively connected to one another, the area 28 is at a defined potential, and is virtually completely electromagnetically shielded from the outside. An opening, which is not identified, is provided only in the plate 34, connects the area 28 to the switching point area 26 and accommodates supply and signal lines 46 (Figure 13) , which ensure that current is supplied to the control device 5 and ensure the signal flowing between the control device 5 and the gate electrodes of the thyristors T1 and T2.<br>
Flat insulation 40, which is in the form of a flat layer (Figure 13) is provided between the plates 30 and 32. The plates 30 and 34, the screws 38, the hollow cylinder 42 and the intermediate plate 44 are thus at the same potential once an AC voltage has been applied to the current connection of the voltage limiter, which are formed by the plates 30 and 36. In contrast, the plates 32, 36, the screws 39 and an intermediate plate 48 which supports the plate 32 and is used as a current connection for the varistor 1 are at the same opposite potential, As can be seen from Figure 13, the embedding of the two inner plates 32 and 34, of the screws 38 and 3 9, of the intermediate plates 4 4 and 48, of the hollow cylinder 42, of the varistor 1 and of the thyristors T1 and T2 in an electrically insulating [lacuna] results in insulation 50 being formed, which extends between the two outer plates 30 and 36 and ensures reliable operation of the voltage limiter even when high power loads are applied. The insulation 50 is advantageously produced by extrusion coating the preassembled housing 22, which already holds the varistor, the thyristors and the control device, with an insulating resin, in particular based on silicone. Since the openings which hold the screws 38 and 39 are larger than the screws.<br><br>
the liquid resin can enter the opening and, once it has cured, can form insulation between the screws and the plates which have the openings.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 12, centering pins 52, which are passed into the area 2 6, are introduced into the plates 34 and 36. These pins hold the two thyristors Ti and T2 at predetermined points in the area 2 6, and make it considerably easier to assemble the voltage limiter.<br><br>
