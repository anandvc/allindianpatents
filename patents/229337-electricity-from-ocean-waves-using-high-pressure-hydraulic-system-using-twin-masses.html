				<td>This invention relates to production of electricity from ocean waves using high-pressure hydraulic system and is particularly directed towards absorbing most of the energy of ocean waves and under currents and without power fluctuations.<br>
Ocean wave currents contain considerable quantity of power, which can be utilized for power generation. This energy is mostly concentrated below the surface of the water level in the form of ocean waves, currents and pressure. The present systems, which floats and converts ocean wave power into electrical energy are not econonical and requires frequent repairs for their maintenance. These machines are not successful for producing power on commercial basis due to their poor efficiency. The recent development in this field is the "Archimedes wave swing generator" developed in Holland, which was published in India . It was reported in the essay that the prototype generator fixed in the ■ sea was working well. The brief description of working of this system is as follows. The system consists of two water chambers and two air chambers and the air chambers are interconnected and the center is mounted on an axis fixed to a frame. The air chambers are again connected with an air pipe of smaller dia. One water chamber and one air chamber are mounted on top of the axis and the other pair is mounted at the bottom of the axis. Both the water chambers will have openings on opposite faces for entering ocean waves inside. When the ocean waves move in the forward direction the waves enter the top water chamber and compress the<br><br>
air in the first air chamber below it. The air is compressed and this air will enter the second air chamber below the axis and compress the water in the second air chamber. Due to this action the weight of the system above the axis is increased and the weight of the system below the axis is reduced due to which the system makes a half round around the axis and the bottom system ccmes to top position. When the waves are reversed the waves enter the bottom water chamber and the water in the first air chamber is forced into the second air chamber at top and the air in the second air chamber is forced into the first air chamber through the smaller dia air pipe. Due to this action again the system makes a half rotation which means that for every forward and backward stroke of waves the system makes one full revolution and due to the continuous and firm wave power at deeper depths of ocean of about lSmts the system rotate continuously. The system has to be fixed in ocean as per the wavelength and pitch of waves otherwise the system will not work properly.But still seme drawbacks are existing in the system.<br>
l.As there is no effective storage and retrieval mechanism of energy in the system there is a possibility of power fluctuations.<br>
2.As the ocean wave energy is directly absorbed by the system the torque over the generator shaft will vary when the wave strength is reduced during the cycle.<br><br>
3.The generator has to be placed in the ocean itself, which may create sane technical problems like water leakage into generator, electrical short circuit etc.<br>
4.The generator can not be designed for higher capacity like 50 raws or lOQmws since the unit size is increased and the length of shaft is increased.Presently the research team is engaged in the<br>
Production of 8raws units.<br>
5.This system cannot absorb most of the energy of ocean waves.<br>
There is no resemblance between this system and the presently proposed high-pressure hydraulic system both in concept and in working. The system is mentioned here only to mention it as the prior art. Presently high-pressure hydraulic systems do not exist in the world to exploit wave energy.<br>
Another work carried out by the British researchers published in India pointed out that a large water filled cylinder which just floats in water and connected to pressure cylinders on either side of the water filled cylinder at bottom was tried which produced highly varying hydraulic pressure over turbine and did not mention any solution for the problem and hence does not constitute any invention.<br>
After a rigorous research and development the present inventor found the following iitportant points for developing the most effective system for converting the ocean power into electrical energy economically and without fluctuations.<br><br>
l.The ocean power is mainly concentrated below surface level of water and not in the visible waves and hence floating systems cannot absorb the ocean energy effectively due to which their efficiency is very less. Hence any system, which is submerged, is more safe, reliable, efficient and economical for power generation.<br>
2. A submerged energy absorption device is essential. It is recognized that a large steel cylinder, which just floats in water [Filled with water whose wt is approxaitately equal to the weight of water displaced by the cylinder ] can effectively and economically absorb ocean wave power.<br>
3.A system is essential to store the energy absorbed by the energy absorbing system and to release the stored energy constantly, uniformly and efficiently without any impulse or shock to the turbine. The present inventor found that lifting a large mass by using the energy absorbed by the energy absorbing system [water filled cylinder] is an efficient technique to store the energy and the stored energy [work done] is released to the hydraulic cylinders during the descending of mass in an efficient manner. 4.Hydraulic transmission of power is an efficient method of power transmission economically to the turbine from the energy releasing system i.e. large mass and hence 2nos of hydraulic cylinders with one inlet valve and one delivery valve for each are proposed for production of high and constant pressure fluid to be fed to the turbine simultaneously from both the hydraulic cylinders or from<br><br>
one cylinder depending on the positions of the pistons of the hydraulic cylinders and by ensuring correct main gate valve opening of the pipeline a continuous jet of high and constant pressure fluid is ensured over turbine.<br>
5.An energy storage and retrieval system is essential for supply of high-pressure fluid to the turbine if the supply of pressure fluid is stopped from the hydraulic cylinders due to large opening of gate valve. That is when the gate valve opening is larger than required the quantity of pressure fluid is not sufficient to be fed to the turbine continuously and due to the increase of the time period fron wave to wave during a period of time. But in the Present system by fixing the gate valve opening for the max. time period that occurs at a place between wave to wave the necessity of an energy storage and retrieval system is eliminated. But in this method by fixing the gate valve opening for max. time between wave to wave sane energy is wasted. To avoid this energy wastage there is provided an energy storage and retrieval mechanism in the mainline just before the main gate valve to increase the efficiency of the plant. Where there is no adverse change of energy of waves occurs in ocean the necessity of a storage device is not prominent. In addition in this method since the pressure fluid is produced in both the hydraulic cylinders alternatively the capacity of the hydraulic accumulator required would be very less due to which the economy is increased. BRIEF SUMYIARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a solution for the problem of highly varying hydraulic pressure over turbine blades by providing 2nos of large masses one on each side of the system which absorbs the highly impulse type of ocean energy by way of doing work during their upward movement and releases the stored energy to the hydraulic cylinders during their downward movement due to which constant pressure fluid is produced in the hydraulic cylinders and is the inventive step.It is another object of the invention to provide a solution for improving the efficiency of the system by providing hydraulic accumulator comprising two branch lines , one outlet pipe, said accumulator connected just before the main gate valve of the main line since the energy of the waves is not constant during a span of time.<br>
Another object of the invention is to formulate a mechanism so as to transfer the energy frcm the energy absorbing system [ water filled cylinder] to the energy storage system [large masses] and to transfer the energy stored to the hydraulic cylinders of the system constantly and uniformly with out any shock and avoiding any pressure change in the hydraulic cylinders during the working stroke of the piston by formulating the revolutionary open loops and closed loops concept using wire ropes. Still further object of the invention is to avoid any pressure change on turbine blades when the capacity of the accumulator is exhausted when pressure fluid is supplied frcm the hydraulic cylinders of the system by providing an outlet pipe to the pressure cylinder of the<br><br>
accumulator.<br>

Further objects,features and other aspects of the invention will be understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention referring to the attached drawings-<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING: Drawing sheet [ 1 ] shows the cross sectional side elevation of the system and also the cross sectional side elevation of the hydraulic accumulator of the system in accordance with the present invention. Drawing sheet [2] shows the plan of the submerged portion of the system as seen frcm top and the cross sectional plan of the hydraulic accumulator in accordance with the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to drawing sheets [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] a steel or steel cum prestressed concrete rectangular structural frame[55] is shown and is connected to anchor blocks at corners of the frame at bottom to avoid any uplift of frame. A large steel or steel cum pre stressed concrete cylinder [1] which is filled with water and just floats in water is attached to the central bottom portion of frame [55] by using link [3] with hinged joints at both the ends of the link.The large cylinder [1] is filled with water such that itfs total weight is about 5% less than the weight of the quantity of water displaced by the cylinder. In this condition the large cylinder will just float in ocean water and cores to vertical position after doing work.The large water filled cylinder [l]will move in the path of an arc of a circle [58] and [59] when stroked by ocean waves on either side of it's vertical static position.In other words the large cylinder moves in the path of an arc of a circle during the strike of the waves. The large water filled cylinder will have a circular central steel girder [2] to which steel wire ropes are connected on either side of the cylinder and the other ends of the ropes are wound over the large drum pulleys [7] and [23] and firmly connected to the surface of the said large pulleys .The length of rope wound over the large drum pulley depends upon the maximum displacement of the water filled cylinder allowed from it's vertical static position. Two more smaller pulleys [8] and [24] are built in and connected to the larger drum<br><br>
pulleys [7] and [23] on the same axis to form stepped pulleys [7,8] and [23,24].Two more strips of ropes [10],[26] are connected to the surface of the smaller pulleys [8] and [24] and their other ends are connected to two large cylindrical masses [11], [27] whose specific weight is several times more than that of sea water.The large masses [11], [27] are further connected by two closed loops [9][12][13][20][9] and [25][28][29] [36][25] movable freely over pulleys comprising pistons [15], [31] and piston rods [19],[35] as part of the loops and the said pistons can move freely in the hydraulic cylinders [ 14 ] and [30].The said hydraulic cylinders have two nos of unidirectional valves for each [17], [60] and [32], [37] one for sucking of water inside and the other for delivering the highly pressurized water into the mainline. The delivery valve portions of the hydraulic cylinders are connected with steel alloy pipes [21] and [39] and are connected to the high pressure mainline [40] which supplies water to the turbine [61] shown in drawing sheet [2]. The high pressure mainline [40] is connected to a hydraulic accumulator with two nos branch lines [47] and [48] just before the main gate valve [41] of the line. The branch line [ 47 ] is fitted with gate valve [ 42 ] and unidirectional valve [44] for controlling the flow. The branch line [48] is also fitted with gate valve [45] and one unidirectional valve [46].The hydraulic cylinder [52] of the accumulator will move up and down over the fixed rams [53]. The high-pressure fluid will be supplied to the accumulator cylinders<br><br>
through the branch line [47] and through the gate valve [42] and unidirectional valve [44]. The high pressure mainline [40] is fitted with a main gate valve [41] for controlling the discharge over the turbine [61] and for controlling the ratio of application of force period and non application of force periods in the hydraulic cylinders of the system. The bottom gap portion below the large water filled cylinder is covered with an adjustable pre stressed concrete plate [4] so as to avoid escape of energy more than designed to the other side of the large cylinder." The large cylinder[1] is placed at the zone of max turbulence and the large masses are placed at the zone of minimum turbulence across the depth of ocean water ".An outlet pipe [51] is attached to the hydraulic cylinder [52] of the accumulator above the basement level of the accumulator the purpose of which is well described in the heading working of plant.The rectangular frame is sufficiently anchored on all four sides of the frame by weight blocks. The movement of the large cylinder will be stopped by rubber blocks [62] and [63] so as to restrict the movement of the water filled cylinder to design value.It is to be understood that the same construction applies to the other face of the system also.<br>
WORKING OF PLANT:<br>
When there is no turbulence in ocean the large cylinder [1] is in it's truly vertical position and the pistons [15] and [31] in the hydraulic cylinders are at their top positions. In this condition<br><br>
the ropes [6], [10] and [22], [26] connected to the axis of the large cylinder [1] and the two large masses [11], [27] via the stepped pulleys [7,8],[23,24] are in tight condition.When the ocean waves strike the large cylinder from right side the energy of water is transferred to the large cylinder [1] and the cylinder will move in an arc direction [58] and the rope [6] is also pulled which rotates the large drum pulley [ 7 ]. When the pulley [ 7 ] rotates the smaller drum pulley [8] also rotates and the loop [10] pulls the large mass [11] with a multiplied force until the momentum of the large cylinder [1] is corpletely transferred to the large mass [11] .When the large mass [11] is lifted up the closed loop [9] [12] [13] [20] [9] is also pulled and the piston [15] of the hydraulic cylinder [14] moves down and the ocean water is sucked into the hydraulic cylinder [14] .When all the momentum of the water filled cylinder is transferred to the mass [11] the movement of the mass is stopped and immediately pulls the rope [10] down due to the self weight.This action will automatically closes the valve [17] and the high pressure water is ejected out into the mainline through the delivery valve [60] .When the mass [11] moves down the loop [6] which will be in loose condition wounds itself over the drum pulley [7]. When the piston [15] is in working stroke the displaced large water filled cylinder cones to vertical position due the partial buoyant force acting on it. Simillarly the same phenomenon happens when the waves strike the large water filled cylinder fron left side and the high<br><br>
pressure water is ejected into the mainline. Both the ropes [6] and [22] will not cone to tight position at any time which means that water is supplied to the turbine continuously frcm at least one hydraulic cylinder. For getting this condition the main gate valve[41] of the mainline [40] is adjusted such that under no circumstances the supply to the turbine shall stop. If we reduce the discharge over the turbine the velocity of the pistons in the hydraulic cylinders will reduce and the water stored in the hydraulic cylinders will be sufficient for the max. period between wave to wave. If we increase the discharge over turbine than designed by using gate valve [41] the velocity of the pistons in the hydraulic cylinders will increase and the water stored in the hydraulic cylinders will not be sufficient to meet for the max. period between wave to wave that is expected. Hence from the above discussion it is clear that the gate valve of the mainline shall be adjusted suitably depending on the max. time period between any two set of waves.The above system can be used with advantage where the energy of the ocean currents will not change abruptly during a short span of time and the time between any two set of waves is reasonably constant. If the time between any two set of waves is largely varying than the gate valve of the mainline has to be synchronized for the max. time between any two set of waves that is expected at that site which is uneconomical since the total quantity of fluid stored in the hydraulic cylinders will not be utilized effectively for power generation during less time period<br><br>
condition between two set of waves. To avoid this difficulty and to increase the efficiency of the system considerably a hydraulic accumulator with two nos of branch lines [47] and [48] will be attached to the mainline just before the main gate valve [41]. In this case the main gate valve of the mainline is synchronized for the average time between two set of waves and the gate valve of the branch line [47] of the accumulator will be synchronized for the difference of'max.time between two set of waves and average time between two set of waves" taking a suitable factor of safety. When high pressure water is supplied into the mainline fran various hydraulic cylinders of the system a part of the total quantity is supplied to the hydraulic accumulator through the gate valve [42] and unidirectional valve [44] and the hydraulic cylinders [52] of the accumulator are lifted up over the fixed rams [53] and water is stored in the system under pressure.When the quantity of fluid stored in the accumulator nears the capacity of the accumulator than the openings [51] in the hydraulic cylinders of the accumulator are automatically opened due to raise of the cylinders and the excess water is discharged into the atmosphere. The remaining quantity of the fluid in the mainline goes to turbine."The fluid to the accumulator is supplied as long as the fluid is supplied to the turbine frcm the hydraulic cylinders of the system so as to ensure no pressure change over turbine.The pressure developed by the accumulator will be slightly less than the pressure developed in the hydraulic cylinders of the<br><br>
system so that the unidirectional valve [46] will be in closed condition when water is supplied to the accumulator through unidirectional valve [44]. This condition is ensured by adjusting the weights [43] and [50] over the accumulator cylinder.<br>
When the time between two set of waves increases then the fluid from the hydraulic cylinders of the system is stopped and inmediately the unidirectional valve [44] of the branch line [47] is closed and the unidirectional valve [46] of the branch line [48] is opened automatically and the water stored in the accumulator rushes into the mainline and is impinged over the turbine. The gate valve of the branch line [48] is synchronized to<br>
The quantity of water that is supplied to the turbine from the hydraulic cylinders of the system.The unidirectional valve [44] of the branch line [47] will be closed automatically when water is supplied frcm the accumulator through the branch line [48] . Thus a continuous jet of high and constant pressure fluid is ensured over the turbine for power generation. Seme times the power of ocean waves and turbulence in ocean increases for a longer period continuously due to various meteorological factors. During this period the displacement of the pistons in the hydraulic cylinders will be increased and the power production can be increased by simply increasing the main gate valve opening of the mainline and by suitably adjusting the gate valve opening of the branch line [47] if necessary. The displacements of the pistons can be recorded by instruments and the power production can either be<br><br>
increased or decreased accordingly by using digital corrputer controlled electric servo motors or manually for control of valves [41] and [42].<br>
DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
1. The structural frame is designed for strength, stability and uplift.<br>
2.The size of large cylinder depends upon length of path to be allowed, ocean wave strength and energy to be absorbed by the large cylinder.<br>
3.The size of the large masses depends upon the effective vertical displacement allowed, enery absorbed by the large cylinder and pressures to be used in the hydraulic cylinders.<br>
4.The stepped drum pulley design depends upon the multiplication force factor required to lift the large mass to restricted displacement.<br>
5.Rope design depends upon the max. force that is developed in the rope.<br>
6. Hydraulic cylinder design depends upon max. displacement of pistons allowed, working pressure allowed.<br>
7.Piping design depends upon the max. pressure that will be developed in the line during operation of the plant.<br>
8 .Accumulator design depends upon 1. Pressure of fluid to be developed in the accumulator. 2. Max. quantity of fluid to be stored in the accumulator so as to meet the max. Non-application<br><br>
of force period in the hydraulic cylinders of the system during the wave cycle at designed pressure.<br>
9. The system is anchored to the ocean floor at a depth such that the ocean energy is transferred to the large cylinder approximately at 50% of total energy absorbed by the large cylinder over either side which means that the displacements of pistons in the hydraulic cylinders on either side of the system are approximately equal due to which the efficiency of the system is increased. The vertical arm of the large cylinder and ocean water depth above the large cylinder are designed suitably for achieving this condition. ADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM:<br>
l.The efficiency of the system in absorbing the ocean energy which will be in various forms like kinetic energy and pressure energy will be high due to the specialized features of the system and thus the capital cost of the plant per lmw is reduced to miniinum. 2.The system can be used in any part of the world since the system will not be affected by the wave parameters like pitch of waves,wave length and wave strength and the system can be syncro nosed for any wave strength by simply adjusting the gate valves of the mainline and accumulator supply line which is a special feature of it's kind over the Holland developed 'Ardiiinedes wave swing generator"<br>
3.The capital cost required per lmw of energy production is the minimum for present project since the system can be fabricated by<br><br>
using large cylinders, large masses, stepped drum pulleys, wire<br>
ropes and hydraulic cylinders and does not constitute any<br>
intricate or canplicated machined parts.Above all pre stressed<br>
concrete and plain cement concrete can be extensively used for<br>
various components of the plant thus reducing the cost further.<br>
4.The system will not be affected by tides of ocean,high winds and<br>
cyclones since the whole system is completely submerged in water.<br>
5. The power production can either be increased or decreased<br>
depending on wave strength.<br>
6.The generator can be designed for 50mws , locmws, or 25Qmws and<br>
hence the generator and turbine cost per mw is greatly reduced.<br>
7.The plant can be closed down completely for want of repairs by<br>
closing down all gate valves of main line and branch lines.<br>
8.The system will produce a perfect constant pressure due to it's<br>
specialized features and hence no power fluctuations will occur<br>
which is a major advantage and is a notable feature.<br>
9. The system can be fixed at any point of the ocean for<br>
production of power i.e the system can produce power from wherever<br>
there is turbulence in fluid system.<br>
10.As the size of the large cylinder increases the power absorbed<br>
by the  system increases  irrespective of the pattern of<br>
turbulence.The "Archimedes wave swing generator" depends on the<br>
continuous and firm power available at deeper depths of ocean i.e<br>
approximately at 15 Mts frcm surface level due to which it can not<br>
convert most the ocean energy into electrical energy. This is<br><br>
because of the fact that energy cannot be stored in this system.<br>
But the present system can absorb most of the ocean energy and<br>
converts it into electrical energy. As per a rough estimate the<br>
present system will produce about IMv of energy frcm every 5mtrs<br>
length of seacoast.<br>
11. The system can be designed with hydraulic accumulator or<br>
without hydraulic accumulator.<br>

CLAIMS:<br>
I CLAIM<br>
1] A high pressure hydraulic system comprising a large water filled cylinder [ 1 ] which swings in the path of an arc of a circle [58], [59] in ocean water connected through an arm [3] to the central bottom portion of a rectangular frame[55] with hinged j oint [ 5 ], said arm having an adj ustable plate[4] vertically movable in a slot, the axis of the said large cylinder [1] is connected with two open wire rope loops [6,10], [22,26] wound over stepped pulleys[7,8], [23,24] and connected to masses [11], [27] said masses [11], [27] connected by another set of closed wire rope loops [9][12][13][20][9],[36][29][28][25][36] freely movable over four nos of pulleys firmly connected to the frame comprising pistons [15], [31] connected to piston rods [19], [35] as part of the said closed loops and the said closed loops are passed through hydraulic cylinders[14], [30] said pistons [15],[31] can move freely in the said hydraulic cylinders[14], [30] and the said hydraulic cylinders rigidly connected to the frame[55] and having two nos of unidirectional valves[17],[60] and [32], [37] for each among which one is an inlet valve and the other is a delivery valve and the said outlet valves[60], [37] of the said hydraulic cylinders[14], [30] are connected to branch pipes[21],[39] and the said branch pipes are in turn connected to the high pressure main line [40] which feeds the high pressure fluid to the turbine [61], said main line fitted with main gate valve [41] just<br><br>
before the nozzle point,said main line connected to a hydraulic accumulator before the said gate valve[41], said accumulator comprising two Brach lines out of which the first branch line[47] will feed the fluid to the accumulator through unidirectional valve[44] and gate valve[42] and the second branch line[48] allows the high pressure fluid stored in the said accumulator to be supplied to the said turbine [ 61 ] through a unidirectional valve[46] and gate valve[45] when the pressure in the main line decreases due to stoppage of fluid frcm the said hydraulic cylinders[14], [30] of the system, the pressure cylinder of the accumulator [52] connected to a exit pipe [51] just above the basement of said accumulator, rubber stoppers [62], [63] provided for controlling the displacement of the large cylinder [1] and the same construction described above follows on the other face of the frame [55].<br>
2] "The high pressure hydraulic system" as claimed in claim [1] in which said large masses [11], [27] will store the energy during their upward movement and release the energy to the said hydraulic cylinders [14],[30] constantly and uniformly during their downward movement.<br>
3]  "The high pressure hydraulic system" as claimed in claim [1] in which the said open loops [6,10], [22,26] will transfer the energy frcm the said large water filled cylinder [1] to the said large masses [11], [27] and the said closed loops will transfer the<br><br>
energy  from  the  said  masses  to  the  said  hydraulic<br>
cylinders[14],[30] of the said system.<br>
4]  "The high pressure hydraulic system" as claimed in claim [1]<br>
in which said branch line  [47] will supply fluid to the<br>
accumulator and said branch line [48] will supply fluid from said<br>
accumulator to turbine.<br>
5] "The high pressure hydraulic system" as claiired in claim [1] in<br>
which said gate valves [41], [42], [45] are synchronized with the<br>
ocean energy for optimum performance of the said system.<br>
6] "The high pressure hydraulic system" as claimed in claim 1 in<br>
which the said exit pipe [51] will control the pressure change<br>
over the turbine.<br>
7] "The high pressure hydraulic system" substantially as herein<br>
described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br><br></td>
