Magnesium Halide Complexes, Catalyst Components and Catalysts for Olefin Polymerization Prepared therefrom<br>
Cross Reference of Related Applications<br>
The present application claims the priority of the Chinese Patent Application No. 200610067177.9, filed on April 6, 2006, and the Chinese Patent Application No. 200610113864.X, filed on October 20, 2006, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety and for all purposes.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to spherical magnesium halide complexes comprising a magnesium halide, an alcohol and a gem-dihydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbon, to spherical catalyst components and catalysts prepared from the spherical magnesium halide complexes, and to use of the catalysts in the polymerization of a-olefin CH2=CHR or a mixture thereof, in which R is H, or alkyl or aryl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Spherical magnesium halide-alcohol complexes and spherical Ziegler-Natta catalysts prepared by supporting titanium compounds and electron donor compounds thereon are well-known in the art. When used in olefin polymerization, in particular, propylene polymerization, such spherical catalysts exhibit relatively high catalytic activities and isotacticities, and the resultant polymers have good particle morphology and higher bulk densities.<br>
Most of the known magnesium halide complexes are magnesium chloride-alcohol complexes comprising generally binary components of magnesium chloride and alcohol, and in some cases, the magnesium halide complexes further comprise a minor amount of water. Such magnesium halide complexes may be<br>
prepared by known processes, such as spray drying process, spray cooling process, high-pressure extruding process, or high-speed stirring process. The magnesium chloride-alcohol complexes are described in, for example, US 4,421,674, US 4,469,648, WO 87/07620, WO 93/11166, US 5,100,849, US 6,020,279, US 4,399,054, EP 0 395 383, US 6,127,304 and US 6,323,152.<br>
When the catalysts prepared from such magnesium chloride-alcohol complexes are used in olefin polymerization, a cracking phenomenon of the catalyst particles takes place easily so that there are many polymer fines. The main reason might be that catalytic active sites formed in the complex supports by reacting the complexes with titanium halides and electron donor compounds are not uniformly distributed. In order to overcome this drawback, it has been attempted to incorporate electron donor compounds in the course of the preparation of the magnesium chloride-alcohol complex supports. For example, the techniques as disclosed in Chinese Patent ZL02136543.1 and CN1563112A introduce internal electron donors well-known in the art, such as phthalates, in the preparation of the supports so as to form spherical "magnesium chloride-alcohol-phthalate" multi-component supports, which react then with titanium tetrachloride to form catalysts. However, because the spherical multi-component supports are likely viscous during the preparation thereof, it is difficult to form spherical particles having a desired particle diameter (the disclosed spherical supports have average particle sizes, D50, in the range of from 70 to 200 microns). Furthermore, when used in propylene polymerization, the catalysts exhibit a catalytic activity of 406gPP/gcat. Therefore, the catalysts are not satisfied.<br>
Moreover, when used in propylene polymerization, the catalysts prepared from the above magnesium chloride-alcohol complex supports exhibit un-satisfied hydrogen response so that they cannot meet the requirement of industrial scale production of polypropylene.<br>
Summery of the invention<br>
The inventors diligently studied to solve the aforementioned problems. As a result, they have found out that introducing a gem-dihydrocarbyloxy hydrocarbon compound in the preparation of a magnesium halide complex may provide a novel particulate magnesium halide complex, which not only has a narrower particle size distribution and an easily controlled average particle size but also can be prepared by a simple process (this facilitates the industrial scale production of the complex). Meanwhile, when used in olefin polymerization, especially propylene polymerization, the olefin polymerization catalysts prepared therefrom exhibit very high activities and isotacticities, and better hydrogen response, and the resulting polymers have good particle morphology and less fines so that the catalysts are quite suitable for the industrial scale production of polypropylene. Furthermore, catalysts based on the combination of the supports of the invention and diether type internal electron donors have a characteristic that the polymerization rate decreases more slowly when used in propylene polymerization.<br>
Thus, an object of the invention is to provide a spherical magnesium halide<br>
complex comprising a magnesium halide, an alcohol and a gem-dihydrocarbyloxy<br>
hydrocarbon.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process for preparing the<br>
spherical magnesium halide complex according to the invention.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a titanium-containing<br>
catalyst component for olefin polymerization, which is a reaction product of the<br>
spherical magnesium halide complex of the invention,  at least one titanium<br>
compound, and optionally an internal electron donor.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a catalyst for olefin<br>
polymerization, comprising a reaction product of the following components:<br>
a)	the titanium-containing catalyst component according to the invention;<br>
b)	an alkylaluminum cocatalyst; and<br>
c)	optionally, an external electron-donor.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a process for polymerizing olefin CH2=CHR, in which R is H, or alkyl or aryl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, comprising contacting the olefin(s) with the catalyst according to the invention under polymerization conditions.<br>

The catalysts of the invention are useful in polymerization of olefin CI 12=CHR (wherein R is H, or alkyl or aryl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms) or a feed containing said olefin and a small amount of diene, if necessary.<br>
Thus, in the fourth aspect, the present invention provides a process for polymerizing olefin, comprising contacting an olefin of formula CH2=CHR, wherein R is H, or alkyl or aryl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and optionally another kind of said olefin as comonomer, and optionally a diene as a second comonomer, with the catalysts of the invention under polymerization conditions.<br>
The polymerization of olefin(s) is carried out in liquid phase of liquid monomer or a solution of monomer in an inert solvent, or in gas phase, or in a combination of gas phase and liquid phase, according to the known processes. The polymerization is generally carried out at a temperature of from 0°C to 150°C, preferably from 60°C to 100°C, and at normal or higher pressure.<br>
Without limited by any theory, it is believed that, because the active sites in the catalysts prepared from the spherical magnesium halide complexes of the invention are distributed uniformly, polymer fines, which are generally considered as being resulted from cracking of catalyst particles, are substantially reduced, when the catalysts are used in olefin polymerization, especially propylene polymerization. Meanwhile, the catalysts exhibit better hydrogen response, and very high activities and isotacticities.<br>
