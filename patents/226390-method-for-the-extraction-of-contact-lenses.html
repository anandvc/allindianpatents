CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional Application Ser. No.<br>
60/426,023, filed November 13, 2002, incorporated by reference herein in it entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The invention relates to methods useful in the production of contact lenses. In<br>
particular, the invention provides methods in which excess materials are removed from lenses.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The use of tinted contact lenses to alter the natural colorof the iris is well<br>
known. Colorants used to produce tinted lenses generally are composed of a binding polymer<br>
and pigments. In one method of manufacturing tinted contact lenses described in United States<br>
Application Serial No. 10/027,579, filed December 20, 2001, incorporated in its entirety herein<br>
by reference, the colorant is applied to uncured lens material by transfer of the colorant from a<br>
mold surface to the lens material and the lens material is subsequently cured. As disclosed in US<br>
Application Serial No. 10/027,579, prior to cure it is advantageous to heat the mold to cause the<br>
colorant to diffuse into the uncured lens material. The transfer of colorant in this manner,<br>
however, tends to produce debris on the lens surface. While not wishing to be bound by theory,<br>
it is believed that some fraction of the binding polymer, probably particularly low molecular<br>
weight species in the binder polymer, does not become trapped in the contact lens polymer. This<br><br>
fraction of the binding polymer instead attaches to the lens surface, and is difficult to remove<br>
during subsequent hydration and washing steps.<br>
[0004] Hydration and washing steps for contact lenses have been disclosed in US<br>
Patents 6,196,683; 4,668,240; 5,824,719; 4,963,159; 4,634,449; 4,777,684; 4,733,959;<br>

6,012,471; 5,836,323; 5,762,081; 5,706,634; 5,690,866; 5,649,410; 5,640,980; 5,561,970; and<br>
5,080,839 incorporated herein in their entireties by reference.<br>
[0005] Known hydration and cleaning steps in distilled or deionized water, or saline<br>
solutions have been found to not remove the above-described debris; thus, a new method of<br>
extraction had to be devised to clean lenses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] This invention provides methods for extracting excess materials from a contact<br>
lens, comprising the steps of:<br>
treating a contact lens with a liquid, preferably a solution, that causes the contact lens to<br>
swell to a size larger than its functional size;<br>
and treating said contact lens with a liquid, preferably a solution, that causes it to shrink<br>
back to its functional size.<br>
[0007] The methods of this invention can be accomplished by treating said contact lens<br>
with at least two liquids that differ with regard to their respective temperature, ionic strength,<br>
composition, and/or pH such that the contact lens swells in the first liquid and then returns to its<br>
functional shape in the second liquid.<br>
[0008] Examples of useful liquids that would cause a contact lens to swell and then<br>
return to its functional size are saline solutions having two different ionic strengths; deionized<br>
(DI) or distilled water and saline solutions or organic solvents having high and low temperatures;<br>
solutions having high and low percentages of organic solvents and solutions having high and low<br>
pH.<br>
[0009] In one preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention include the steps of<br>
treating a contact lens with a first solution having a first ionic strength;<br>
treating said contact lens with a second solution having a lower ionic strength than said<br>
first solution; and treating said contact lens with a third solution having a higher ionic strength<br>
than said second solution. The second solution causes the contact lens to swell. The contact lens<br>
returns to its functional size in the third solution. Such methods can further include the step of<br>
treating the contact lens with another solution having a lower ionic strength than said first<br>
solution.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010] This invention provides methods that remove excess material from a contact<br>
lens. The term "excess material" is used herein to refer to any unbound monomers or polymers<br>
from the reaction mixture that react to form the contact lens, any diluents, and/or any unreacted<br>
monomers or polymers, colorant, dyes, pigments added to a contact lens, e.g. to tint the contact<br>
lens. The excess materials may be located on the lens surface or within the contact lens, and<br>
include any potential leachables or contaminants on or within the contact lens. The methods of<br>
this invention can be used to remove the excess material from a tinted contact lens. In certain<br>
methods, small pieces of the binder polymer, probably those having an average molecular weight<br>
of less than 5000 Daltons, are not entrapped in the lens composition and stick to the surface of<br>
the contact lens, particularly on the surface in areas of the contact lens where the binder polymer<br>
has been entrapped into the contact lens. If the pieces are not removed, they may interfere with<br>
visual acuity and comfort. This invention can be used to remove excess material, e.g. binder and<br>
colorants, from the surface of lenses made of different materials by different processes.<br>
[0011] The term "swell" means an increase in the water content or an increase in the<br>
diameter of the contact lens or both. The increase in the percent water content will typically be<br>
at least 5 %, more preferably from 10 to 60 %, most preferably from 15 to 40 % above the<br>
percent water content of the lens when the lens is sold to an end-user, also referred to herein as<br>
the functional size. Alternatively, swell can be an increase in the diameter. Typically swell of<br>
the diameter will be an increase of at least 1 mm, more preferably from 2 mm to 6 mm, most<br>
preferably from 3 mm to 4.5 mm in diameter.<br>
[0012] The methods of this invention can be used to extract excess materials from a soft<br>
contact lens comprising a hydrogel or a silicone hydrogel material. A hydrogel is a crosslinked<br>
polymeric system that can absorb and retain water in an equilibrium state. Preferably, the lenses<br>
of the invention are soft contact lenses having water contents of about 0 to about 90 percent,<br>
more preferably between 35 and 70 percent. For hydrogels, the lens-forming monomer mixture<br>
will typically include at least one hydrophilic monomer and a crosslinking agent (a crosslinker<br>
being defined as a monomer having multiple polymerizable functionalities).<br>
[0013] Suitable hydrophilic monomers include those with hydroxy groups and carboxyl<br>
groups such as, unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as methacrylic acid and acrylic acid;<br>
(meth)acrylic substituted alcohols, such as 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate and 2-<br>
hydroxyethylacrylate; vinyl lactams, such as N-vinyl pyrrolidone; and (meth)acrylamides, such<br>
as methacrylamide and N.N-dimethylacrylamide. Typical crosslinking agents include polyvinyl,<br>
typically di- or tri-vinyl monomers, such as di- or tri(meth)acrylates of diethyleneglycol,<br><br>
triethyleneglycol, butyleneglycol and hexane-l,6-diol; and divinylbenzene. A specific example<br>
of a hydrogel-forming monomer mixture is polymacon, composed primarily of 2-<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate with a small amount of ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as a<br>
crosslinking monomer. Optionally, the monomer mixture may include a silicone containing<br>
monomer in order to form a silicone hydrogel copolymer. Examples of silicone-containing<br>
monomers include: monomers including a single polymerizable unsaturated radical, such as<br>
methacryloxypropyl tris(trimethylsiloxy)silane, pentamethyldisiloxanyl methylmethacrylate,<br>
tris(trimethylsiloxy) methacryloxy propylsilane, methyldi(trimethylsiloxy) methacryloxymethyl<br>
silane, 3-ftris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl] propyl vinyl carbamate, and 3-[tris(trimethylsiloxy)silyl]<br>
propyl vinyl carbonate; and multifunctional ethylenically "end-capped" siloxane-containing<br>
monomers, especially difunctional monomers having two activated unsaturated radicals. A<br>
specific example of a silicone hydrogel-forming monomer mixture is balafilcon, based on N-<br>
vinyl pyrrolidone and the aforementioned vinyl carbonate and carbamate monomers, disclosed in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,260,00.<br>
[0014] Other silicone hydrogels may be made by reacting blends of macromers,<br>
monomers, and combinations thereof along with additives such as polymerization initiators.<br>
Suitable materials include, without limitation, silicone hydrogels made from silicone macromers<br>
and hydrophilic monomers. Examples of such silicone macromers include, without limitation,<br>
polydimethylsiloxane with pendant hydrophilic groups as described in United States Patents Nos.<br>
4,259,467; 4,260,725 and 4,261,875; polydimethylsiloxane macromers with polymerizable<br>
function described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,136,250; 4,153,641; 4,189,546; 4,182,822; 4,343,927;<br>
4,254,248; 4,355,147; 4,276,402; 4,327,203; 4,341,889; 4,486,577; 4,605,712; 4,543,398;<br>
4,661,575; 4,703,097; 4,837,289; 4,954,586; 4,954,587; 5,346,946; 5,358,995; 5,387,632 ;<br>
5,451,617; 5,486,579; 5,962,548; 5,981,615; 5,981,675; and 6,039,913; and combinations<br>
thereof. They may also be made using polysiloxane macromers incorporating hydrophilic<br>
monomers such as those described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,010,141; 5,057,578; 5,314,960;<br>
5,371,147 and 5,336,797; or macromers comprising polydimethylsiloxane blocks and polyether<br>
blocks such as those described in U.S. Patents Nos. 4,871,785 and 5,034,461. All of the cited<br>
patents are hereby incorporated in their entireties by reference.<br>
[0015] Suitable materials also may be made from combinations of oxyperm and<br>
ionoperm components such as described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,760,100; 5,776,999; 5,789,461;<br>
5,807,944; 5,965.631 and 5,958,440. Hydrophilic monomers may be incorporated into such<br>
copolymers, including 2-hydroxyethyI methacrylate ("HEMA"), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, N,N-<br>
dimethylacrylamide ("DMA"), N-vinylpyrrolidone, 2-vinyl-4,4'»dimethyl-2-oxazolin-5-one,<br><br>
methacrylic acid, and 2-hydroxyethy] methacrylamide. Additional siloxane monomers may be<br>
incorporated such as tris(trimethylsiloxy)silylpropy] methacrylate. or the siloxane monomers<br>
described in U.S. Patents Nos. 5,998,498; 3,808,178; 4,139,513; 5,070,215; 5,710,302;<br>
5,714,557 and 5,908,906. They may also include various toughening agents, UV blockers, and<br>
wetting agents. They can be made using diluents such as primary alcohols, or the secondary or<br>
tertiary alcohols described in U.S. Patent No. 6,020,445. All of the cited patents are hereby<br>
incorporated in their entireties by reference.<br>
[0016] The preferred contact lenses include ionic hydrogels having the USAN names:<br>
etafilcon A, bufilcon A, deltafilcon A, droxifilcon A, phemfilcon A, ocufilcon A, balafilcon A,<br>
perfllcon A, ocufilcon B, ocufilcon C, ocufilcon D, ocufilcon E, methafilcon A, vifilcon A,<br>
focofilcon A, tetrafilcon B, ocufilcon F, epsifilcon A.<br>
[0017] The invention using buffered aqueous solutions is most effective to remove<br>
excess material from ionic contact lenses or contact lenses comprising materials having ionic<br>
groups. Examples of the ionic groups within the contact lens materials, or colorant or binder<br>
polymers, if present, include the anionic carboxylate groups derived from carboxylic acids, such<br>
as methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid, or those derived from other<br>
monomers which form ionic groups such as N-carboxy-beta-alanine-N-vinyl ester, and vinyl<br>
phenol, and other monomers with amino groups or phenolic groups. Amino groups and phenolic<br>
groups form ionic groups when placed in water at the appropriate pH.<br>
[0018] In addition, ionic dyes or pigments may be used to provide additional ionic<br>
nature to the contact lens. Specific examples of positively charged pigments include: ultramarine <br>
blue, FD&amp;C blue no. 1, and chromium hydroxide green (available from BF Goodrich, Cleveland,<br>
Ohio, USA). Specific examples of positively charged dyes (including CI designations) include:<br>
ingrain blue 1 (CI 72420), basic green 1 (CI 42040), basic red 9 (CI 42500) and basic blue 9 (CI <br>
52015) (available from Aldrich, Milwaukee, Wis., USA). Specific examples of negatively<br>
charged dyes (including CI designations) include: acid red 151 (CI 26900), acid blue 120 (CI<br>
26400), acid orange 8 (CI 15575) and acid green 27 (CI 61580) (available from Aldrich).	<br>
[0019] Preferably the methods for extracting swell the lens from 5-60% above its <br>
functional size, more preferably 10-50%, most preferably 20-35 % above its functional size and<br>
then returning to its functional size. The lens may not be at its functional size prior to the first<br>
step in the method of this invention. Additionally, the swelling preferably is greater than the<br>
increase in size that results from the lens release and hydration steps that have been used in the<br>
prior art. This swelling may occur prior to or during the first step in the methods of this<br><br>
invention, during which the lens typically swells to its functional size or up to 5 percent above its<br>
functional size.<br>
[0020] For methods of this invention using more than three treating steps, a different<br>
solution may be used in each of the treating steps; however, it is preferred that the same solutions<br>
are used in more than one treating step. For example, the first and third solutions and/or the<br>
second and fourth solutions and/or the first and fourth solutions may be the same in certain<br>
embodiments of the invention to simplify the process.<br>
[0021] Various solutions can be used as long as the solutions cause the lens to swell<br>
above its functional size and then to return to its functional size. Examples of such solutions<br>
include, solutions having high and low ionic strengths. The solutions having high ionic strength<br>
can be buffered solutions, or salt solutions. The solutions having relatively lower ionic strength<br>
can be buffered solutions, salt solutions, distilled or deionized water, organic solvents, or<br>
solutions including organic solvents. The preferred lower ionic strength solution is preferably<br>
distilled water or deionized water with or without additives. Other solutions useful in one or<br>
more treating steps of this invention include solutions having high and low pH. For example<br>
contact lenses comprising phenol groups can be treated with a solution having a pH greater than<br>
7 and then treated using solutions of high and low ionic strength to make the contact lenses swell<br>
and then shrink. For example contact lenses having amino groups can be treated with a solution<br>
having a pH less than 7 and then treated using solutions of high and low ionic strength to make<br>
the contact lenses swell and then shrink.<br>
[0022) Preferred methods include treating the contact lens with solutions having<br>
relatively higher and then relatively lower ionic strengths. The difference in ionic strengths,<br>
measured by a conductivity meter, between the solutions having higher and lower ionic strengths<br>
is preferably between from 3 and 30, more preferably 8 and 20 milli-Siemens/cm, and most<br>
preferably between from 13 to 17 milli-Siemens/cm. Contact lens materials with relatively<br>
higher concentrations of ionic groups are generally more sensitive toward changing dimensions<br>
as the ionic strengths of these solutions is varied.<br>
[0023] The term treating is used to mean washing, spraying, soaking, submerging, or<br>
any combination of those options. In preferred embodiments, the contact lens is soaked or<br>
submerged during the treating steps. The treating step typically lasts from between 2 minutes<br>
and 400 minutes, more preferably between from 10 minutes and 180 minutes, most preferably<br>
from 20 to 60 minutes; however, the length of the treating steps depends upon the lens materials,<br>
including the colorants materials if any, the materials that are used for the solutions or solvents,<br>
and the temperatures of the solutions. The treating time can be different than the time required<br><br>
for the lens and the solution to reach equilibrium. Sufficient treating times typically swell the<br>
contact lens, release the excess material from the lens, and return the lens to its functional size.<br>
[0024] The preferred buffered solutions used in this invention can be the same or<br>
different and preferably include buffered salt solutions, such as a salt solution comprising one or<br>
more of the following: sodium chloride, boric acid, sodium borate, dihydrogen sodium<br>
phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium bicarbonate, and the like. Typically, the<br>
solutions include 0.01 to 10, more preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight salt.<br>
[0025] In a preferred embodiment, the buffered solution in the last step of this removal<br>
process is typically the same solution in which the contact lens is stored in the package. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the buffered solution includes 0.84% sodium chloride aqueous solution<br>
having 800 ppm Tween 80, 0.93% boric acid, and 0.18% sodium borate (by weight). A final<br>
treating step with saline solution can occur when the contact lens is packaged; however, in a<br>
preferred extraction method the above described treating steps are in addition to a separate step<br>
of placing the lens in the saline solution in the package.<br>
[0026] The solutions may include any number of additives including surfactants, e.g.,<br>
Tween 80, which is polyoxycthylene sorbitan monooleate), Tyloxapol, octylphenoxy<br>
(oxyethylene) ethanol, amphoteric 10, preservatives, e.g. EDTA, sorbic acid, DYMED,<br>
isopropanol, chlorhexadine gluconate, hydrogen peroxide, thimerosal, polyquad,<br>
polyhexamethylene biguanide, antibacterial agents, lubricants, salts and buffers. Usually these<br>
additives are added to the solution in amounts varying between 0.01 and 10% by weight, but<br>
cumulatively less than 10% by weight.<br>
[0027] The temperatures of the solutions can be anywhere from near freezing to near<br>
boiling; however, it is preferred that the temperatures are between 5 and 95°C, more preferably<br>
between 45 and 80°C. If the solutions are cooler or hotter, then the time that the contact lenes<br>
are treated with the solutions can be adjusted to achieve the desired swelling and subsequent<br>
shrinking.<br>
[0028] In alternative embodiments of the invention additional treating steps can be<br>
included in the methods of the invention, including an initial treatment with DI or distilled<br>
water, which is particularly preferred to remove the diluent within the contact lens material, and<br>
to remove the contact lens from the lens mold. This initial treatment may also swell the contact<br>
lens.<br>
[0029] The methods of extraction typically follows the process step of demolding, i.e.<br>
removing one half of the molding assembly which typically includes a front curve mold and a<br>
back curve mold. In the present method of the invention the lenses are demolded by any of the<br><br>
methods described in US Patents 5,935,492; 5,815,238; 5,744,357; 5,693,268; 5,690,973;<br>
5,294,379 and US Patent Application 10/117545, filed April 5, 2002. In a preferred method,<br>
after demolding, the lenses on the front curves which may be part of a frame as shown in US<br>
Patent 5,080,839 are mated with individual concave slotted cups to receive the contact lenses<br>
when they release from the front curves. The cups are part of a tray. There are 32 lenses per tray<br>
and 20 trays are accumulated into a magazine. Up to 56 magazines are accumulated and then<br>
lowered into tanks between 500 and 1000 gallons by a large robot. The number of lenses in the<br>
tank provide at least Iml/lens solution in the tank. 100 to 150 gallons/minute of the solution in<br>
the tank are removed from the bottom of the tank, filtered and returned to the top of the tank. 1<br>
to 3 gallons/min. of new solution are introduced and an equivalent solution is removed from the<br>
tank. The solution in the tank is preferably maintained at 70-80°C. The solution includes<br>
deionized water, or distilled water, preferably deionized water. The solution also preferably<br>
includes 800 ppm Tween 80. The lenses are submerged in the tank for approximately 88-232<br>
minutes depending on the lens compositions. This leaching step releases the lens from the lens<br>
curve mold and starts hydrating the lens. The diluent e.g. the glycerol comes out of the lens, and<br>
water goes into the lens. When the lens is treated in this manner, it may expand less than 5% in<br>
diameter, approximately to its functional size.<br>
[0030] The magazines housing the contact lenses are placed in a second tank having<br>
the buffered solution comprising 0.84% sodium chloride, 800 ppm Tween 80,0.93% boric acid,<br>
and 0.18% sodium borate (by weight) in DI water. The preferred temperature is 45°C. The<br>
treatment time is preferably greater than 156 minutes. The volume of solution, the circulation<br>
and filtering are the same as for the prior tank. For the preferred embodiment, sodium borate is<br>
the salt that causes the methacrylate groups to deprotonate in this second step. The contact lens<br>
remains approximately the same size and shape.<br>
[0031] After submerging the lenses in the buffered solution above, the magazines<br>
holding the lenses are removed from the tank having the saline solution and placed in a third<br>
tank comprising the same DI water solution described above. The contact lenses are kept in the<br>
tank for 45-70 minutes, at 70-80 C. In this DI water the lenses swell allowing any adsorbed<br>
debris or contaminant to be expelled from the surface and from inside the lens polymer. The lens<br>
swells to 5 to 50% larger than its functional size.<br>
[0032] The last step returns the lens to its functional size shape and orientation. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, in the last step the lenses are removed from the DI water solution in the<br>
third tank and submerged in a fourth tank containing the same saline solution described above<br>
for the same times and temperatures.<br><br>
[0033] The contact Jens treated in this process is preferably a tinted contact lens. The<br>
tinting process can be by any method described in the prior art; such as by soaking a contact lens<br>
in colorant with or without the use of swelling agents, pad printing directly on the contact lens,<br>
pad printing a lens mold or any other method known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

[0034] In the preferred method the contact lens is made by pad printing on the mold<br>
used to mold the contact lens. The mold can be a reusable or disposable mold as disclosed in the<br>
prior art, preferably a disposable mold. In the preferred method the steps are as follows: a.) pad<br>
printing to at least a portion of a molding surface of a mold a tinting-effective amount of a<br>
colorant; b.) dispensing a lens-forming amount of a lens material monomer mix into the mold;<br>
c.) heating rapidly the mold to at or above a glass transition temperature of the colorant; d.)<br>
diffusing the lens material into the colorant while maintaining the mold temperature at or above<br>
a glass transition temperature of the colorant; and e.) curing subsequently the lens material in the<br>
mold under conditions suitable to form the tinted contact lens. The mold is preferably formed<br>
by injection molding, and the "molding surface" is preferably the mold surface used to form a<br>
surface of a lens. If the colorant is opaque, it may cover portions or the entire surface area of the<br>
contact lens that will cover the iris of the end user. If the colorant is transparent it may cover the<br>
portions or the entire surface of the contact lens that will cover the iris and pupil of the end user.<br>
Patterns for the application of colorant have been disclosed in the prior art.<br>
[0035] The amount of colorant applied to the mold is generally about 0.5 mg to about<br>
4.0 mg per lens.<br>
[0036J A lens-forming amount of a lens material monomer mix then is dispensed into<br>
the mold. By "lens-forming amount" is meant an amount sufficient to produce a lens of the size<br>
and thickness desired. Typically, about 10 to about 75, preferably about 50 to about 75 mg of<br>
lens material is used. The "lens material monomer mix", is the mix of monomers, and<br><br>
optionally prepolymers, diluents, photoinitiators, tints, UV absorbers, processing aids, that is<br>
used to form the contact lens via curing, or cross-linking.<br>
[0037] Typically the lens mold or lens mold assembly is assembled by the placement of<br>
the back curve onto the front curve under pressure. Preferably, the mold is then heated rapidly to<br>
facilitate the diffusion of the lens material into the colorant, preferably to a temperature at or<br>
above the glass transition temperature ('Tg") of the colorant. Preferably, the mold is heated<br>
from about room temperature to the Tg in less than 28 seconds, more preferably from between 3-<br>
10 seconds. The molds may be heated by IR lamps preferably located in a tunnel. The period of<br>
time during which the temperature of the mold is heated depends on the time needed for<br>
diffusion which will depend upon the composition of the colorant and the lens material selected,<br>
but preferably is between from about 45 to about 75 seconds, more preferably about 65 to about<br>
71 seconds.<br>
[0038] Subsequent to the diffusion of the lens material into the colorant, the lens<br>
material and colorant are cured under conditions suitable to form the tinted lens. The precise<br>
conditions for curing will depend upon the components of the colorant and lens material<br>
selected. In a preferred embodiment, a visible light cure is used at room air and at a temperature<br>
of about 55 to about 70 ° C. In this embodiment, curing takes from about 75 to about 150<br>
seconds. Once curing is completed, one mold half is removed from the other mold half by a<br>
demold apparatus. In the preferred embodiment the contact lens remains on the front curve mold<br>
for the first treatment step which hydrates the lens and releases the lens from the front mold half.<br>
[0039] In the preferred contact lens to be treated by the method of this invention, the<br>
colorant includes one or more pigments, one or more solvents, and a binding polymer, and the<br>
lens material and the binding polymer of the colorant may form an interpenetrating polymer<br>
network or scmi-IPN with the lens material.<br>
[0040] The preferred binding polymers useful in the colorant are made from a<br>
homopolymer or copolymer, or combinations thereof, having similar solubility parameters to<br>
each other and the binding polymer has similar solubility parameters to the lens material. These<br>
binding polymers may contain functional groups that render the polymers and copolymers of the<br>
binding polymer capable of interactions with each other. The functional groups of one polymer<br>
or copolymer typically interact with that of another in a manner that increases the density of the<br>
interactions helping to inhibit the mobility of and/or entrap the pigment particles. The<br>
interactions between the functional groups may be polar, dispersive, or of a charge transfer<br>
complex nature. The functional groups may be located on the polymer or copolymer backbones<br>
or be pendant from the backbones.<br><br>
[0041] For example, a monomer, or mixture of monomers, that form a polymer with a<br>
positive charge may be used in conjunction with a monomer or monomers that form a polymer<br>
with a negative charge to form the binding polymer. As a more specific example, methacrylic<br>
acid ("MAA") and 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate ("HEMA") may be used to provide a<br>
MAA/HEMA copolymer that is then mixed with a HEMA/3-(N, N-dimethyl) propyl acrylamide<br>
copolymer to form the binding polymer. As another example, the binding polymer may be<br>
composed of bydrophobically-modified monomers including, without limitation, amides and<br>
esters of the formula:<br>
CH3(CH2 )x-L-COCR=CH2<br>
wherein L may be -NH or oxygen, x may be a whole number from:2 to 24, R may be a C1 to C6<br>
alkyl or hydrogen and preferably is methyl or hydrogen. Examples of such amides and esters<br>
include, without limitation, lauryl methacrylamide, and hexyl methacrylate. As yet another<br>
example, polymers of aliphatic chain extended carbamates and ureas may be used to form the<br>
binding polymer.<br>
[0042] Preferred binding polymers are a random block copolymer of HEMA, MAA and<br>
lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"), a random block copolymer of HEMA and MAA or HEMA and<br>
LMA, or a homopolymer of HEMA. The weight percentages, based on the total weight of the<br>
binding polymer, of each component in these embodiments is about 93 to about 100 weight<br>
percent HEMA, about 0 to about 2 weight percent MAA, and about 0 to about 5 weight percent<br>
LMA.<br>
[0043] The binding polymer is somewhat soluble in the lens material and the lens<br>
material can diffuse into the binding polymer. Typically, the molecular weight of the binding<br>
polymer is within a range that maintains a printed image of suitable quality. Preferably, the<br>
molecular weight of the binding polymer is about 7,000 to about 100,000, more preferably about<br>
7,000 to about 40,000, most preferably about 17,000 to about 35,000 Mpeak which corresponds to<br>
the molecular weight of the highest peak in the SEC analyses ( = (Mn x Mw)1/2)<br>
[0044] For purposes of the invention, the molecular weight is determined using a gel<br>
permeation chromatograph with a 90° light scattering and refractive index detectors. Two<br>
columns of PW4000 and PW2500, a methanol-water eluent of 75/25 wt/wt adjusted to 50mM<br>
sodium chloride and a mixture of polyethylene glycol and polyethylene oxide molecules with<br>
well defined molecular weights ranging from 325,000 to 194 are used.<br>
[0045] One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that, by using chain transfer<br>
agents in the production of the binding polymer, by using large amounts of initiator, by using<br>
living polymerization, by selection of appropriate monomer and initiator concentrations, by<br><br>
selection of amounts and types of solvent, or combinations thereof, the desired binding polymer<br>
molecular weight may be obtained. Preferably, a chain transfer agent is used in conjunction with<br>
an initiator, or more preferably with an initiator and one or more solvents to achieve the desired<br>
molecular weight. Alternatively, small amounts of very high molecular weight binding polymer<br>
may be used in conjunction with large amounts of solvent to maintain a desired viscosity for the<br>
binding polymer. Preferably, the viscosity of the binding polymer will be about 4,000 to about<br>
15,000 centipoise at 23° C<br>
[0046] Chain transfer agents useful in forming the binding polymers have chain transfer<br>
constants values of greater than about 0.01, preferably greater than about 7, and more preferably<br>
greater than about 25,000. Suitable such chain transfer agents are known and include, without<br>
limitation, aliphatic thiols of the formula R-SH wherein R is a C1 to C12 aliphatic, a benzyl, a<br>
cyclicalipahtic or CH3(CH2)X-SH wherein x is 1 to 24, benzene, n-butyl chloride, t-butyl<br>
chloride, n-buty] bromide, 2-mercapto ethanol, 1 -dodecyl mercaptan, 2-chlorobutane, acetone,<br>
acetic acid, chloroform, butyl amine, triethylamine, di-n-butyl sulfide and disulfide, carbon<br>
tetrachloride and bromide, and the like, and combinations thereof. Generally, about 0 to about 7<br>
weight percent based on the total weight of polymer formulation will be used. Preferably<br>
dodecanethiol, decanethiol, octanethiol, or combinations thereof is used as the chain transfer<br>
agent.<br>
[0047] Any desirable initiators may be used including, without limitation, ultra-violet,<br>
visible light, thermal initiators and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, a thermal<br>
initiator is used, more preferably 2,2-azobis isobutyronitrile and 2,2-azobis 2-<br>
methylbutyronitrile. The amount of initiator used will be about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent<br>
based on the total weight of the formulation. Preferably, 2,2-azobis 2-methylbutyronitrile is used<br>
with dodecanethiol.<br>
[0048] The binding polymers of the invention may be made by any convenient<br>
polymerization process including, without limitation, radical chain polymerization, step<br>
polymerization, emulsion polymerization, ionic chain polymerization, ring opening, group<br>
transfer polymerization, atom transfer polymerization, and the like. Preferably, a thermally-<br>
initiated, free-radical polymerization is used. Conditions for carrying out the polymerization are<br>
within the knowledge of one ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
[0049] Solvents useful in the production of the binding polymer are medium boiling<br>
solvents having boiling points between about 120 and 230°C. Selection of the solvent to be used<br>
will be based on the type of binding polymer to be produced and its molecular weight. Suitable<br><br>
solvents include, without limitation, diacetone alcohol, cyclohexanone, isopropyl lactate, 3-<br>
methoxy 1-butano], l-ethoxy-2-propanol, and the like.<br>
[0050] Pigments useful with the binding polymer are those organic or inorganic<br>
pigments suitable for use in contact lenses, or combinations of such pigments. The opacity may<br>
be controlled by varying the concentration of the pigment and opacifying agent used, with higher<br>
amounts yielding greater opacity. Illustrative organic pigments include, without limitation,<br>
pthalocyanine blue, pthalocyanine green, carbazole violet, tank orange # 1, and the like and<br>
combinations thereof. Examples of useful inorganic pigments include, without limitation, iron<br>
oxide black, iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, titanium dioxide, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof. In addition to these pigments, soluble and non-soluble dyes may be<br>
used including, without limitation, dichlorotriazine and vinyl sulfone-based dyes.<br>
[0051] Coating, or wetting, of the pigment particles with binding polymer provides<br>
better dispersion of the pigment particles in the bulk binding polymer. The coating may be<br>
achieved by use of electrostatic, dispersive, or hydrogen bonding forces to cover the pigment's<br>
surface. Preferably, a high shear force is used to disperse the pigment into the binding polymer.<br>
The pigment may be added to the binding polymer by dispensing the polymer and pigment into a<br>
suitable mixer, such as a rotary shaft mixer and mixing until a homogeneous mixture results,<br>
typically for a period of up to about 30 minutes. The mixture may be then fed into a high shear<br>
mill, such as an Eiger mill to disperse the pigment into the binding polymer. Repeated milling is<br>
carried out as necessary to achieve complete dispersion. Generally, milling is carried out until<br>
the pigments are about 0.2 to about 3 microns in size. Milling may be carried out using any<br>
suitable, commercially available device including, without limitation, a high shear or ball milling<br>
device.<br>
[0052] In addition to the pigment and binding polymer, the preferred colorant of the<br>
invention contains one or more solvents that aid in coating of the colorant onto a surface. It is<br>
desirable, and preferred, that the colorant has a surface tension below about 27 mN/m. This<br>
surface tension may be achieved by treatment of the surface, for example a mold surface, to<br>
which the colorant will be applied. Surface treatments may be effected by methods known in the<br>
art, such as, but not limited to plasma and corona treatments. Alternatively, and preferably, the<br>
desired surface tension may be achieved by the choice of solvents used in the colorant.<br>
[0053] Thus, the solvents useful in the colorant of the invention are those solvents that<br>
are capable of increasing or decreasing the viscosity of the colorant and aiding in controlling the<br>
surface tension. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, cyclopentanones, 4-methyl-2-<br><br>
pentanone, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, l-ethoxy-2-propanol, isopropyl lactate and the like and<br>
combinations thereof. Preferably, l-ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl lactate are used.<br>
[0054] In a preferred embodiment, at least three different solvents are used in the<br>
colorant of the invention. The first two of these solvents, both medium boiling point solvents,<br>
are used in the production of the binding polymer. Although these solvents may be stripped<br>
from the binding polymer after its formation, it is preferred that they are retained. Preferably, the<br>
two solvents are l-ethoxy-2-propanol and isopropyl lactate. An additional low boiling solvent,<br>
meaning a solvent the boiling point of which is between about 75 and about 120° C, is used to<br>
decrease the viscosity of the colorant as desired. Suitable low boiling solvents include, without<br>
limitation, 2- propanol, 1 -methoxy-2-propanol, 1-propanol, and the like and combinations<br>
thereof. Preferably, 1 -propanol is used.<br>
[0055] The specific amount of solvents used will depend on a number of factors. For<br>
example, the amount of solvents used in forming the binding polymer will depend upon the<br>
molecular weight of the binding polymer desired and the constituents, such as the monomers and<br>
copolymers, used in the binding polymer. The amount of low boiling solvent used will depend<br>
upon the viscosity and surface tension desired for the colorant. Further, if the colorant is to be<br>
applied to a mold and cured with a lens material, the amount of solvent used will depend upon<br>
the lens and mold materials used and whether the mold material has undergone any surface<br>
treatment to increase its wettability. Determination of the precise amount of solvent to be used is<br>
within the skill of one ordinarily skilled in the art. Generally, the total weight of the solvents<br>
used will be about 40 to about 75 weight percent of the final colorant mixture.<br>
[0056] One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that each pigment used will have<br>
a critical pigment volume for the solvents selected. The critical pigment volume may be<br>
determined by any known means and, generally, is a volume based on the efficiency of a solvent<br>
and the binding polymer to suspend the pigment particles for example, as disclosed in Patton,<br>
Temple C, Paint Flow and Pigment Dispersion, 2d ed., pp 126-300 (1993).<br>
[0057] In addition to the solvents, a plasticber may be and, preferably is, added to the<br>
colorant to reduce cracking during the drying of the colorant and optica] mold parts, to enhance<br>
the final quality of the image produced using the colorant, and to enhance the diffusion and<br>
swelling of the colorant by the lens material. The type and amount of plasticizer used will<br>
depend on the molecular weight of the binding polymer used and, for colorants placed onto<br>
molds that are stored prior to use. the shelf-life stability desired. Useful plasticizers include,<br>
without limitation, glycerol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol,<br>
polyethylene glycol 200, 400, or 600, and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably,<br><br>
glycerol is used. Amounts of plasticizer used generally will be 0 to about 10 weight percent<br>
based on the weight of the colorant.<br>
[0058] The opacity of the colorant may be controlled by varying the pigment<br>
concentration and the pigment particle size used. Alternatively, an opacifying agent may be<br>
used. Suitable opacifying agents, such as for example titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, are<br>
commercially available.<br>
[0059] In a preferred colorant mixture of the invention, about 0.2 to about 25 weight<br>
percent of pigment, about 30 to about 45 weight percent of binding polymer, about 40 to about<br>
70 weight percent of solvents, about 0 to about 25 weight percent of titanium dioxide, and about<br>
0.2 to about 7 weight percent of plasticizer is used. The weight percentages are based on the<br>
total weight of the colorant mixture.<br>
[0060] The binding polymer may be loaded with about 0.2 to about 25 weight percent<br>
based on the weight of the colorant for organic pigments and about 0.2 to about 50 weight<br>
percent for inorganic pigments. However, high pigment concentrations may impart a very dark<br>
hue. Therefore, preferably about 0.2 to about 7 weight percent of organic pigments and about 0<br>
to about 20 weight percent of inorganic pigments are used. Combinations of pigments may be<br>
used in ratios dependent upon the color, shade, and hue desired.<br>
[0061] One ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that additives other than those<br>
discussed may be included in the colorant composition of the invention. Suitable additives<br>
include, without limitation, additives that aid flow and leveling, additives for foam prevention,<br>
additives for rheology modification, and the like, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0062] The colorant of the invention becomes embedded in the lens material upon<br>
curing of the material. Thus, the colorant may embed closer to the front or back surface of the<br>
lens formed depending on the surface of the mold to which the lens the colorant is applied.<br>
Additionally, one or more layers of colorant may be applied in any order. In yet another<br>
embodiment, a clear binding polymer layer may be used in conjunction with the colorant. For<br>
example, in the method of the invention a clear binding polymer layer may be applied to the<br>
molding surface of a mold half prior to application of the colorant. The clear binding polymer<br>
may be the same or different from the binding polymer used for the colorant layers. If the clear<br>
binding polymer is different from the binding polymer, it typically is compatible with the<br>
binding polymer and lens material in terms of expansion factor and ability to swell and it<br>
typically is capable of swelling into the lens material.<br>
[0063] As described above, many lens materials are useful in this invention; however,<br>
in the preferred embodiment, the lens material used is a HEMA based hydrogel, more preferably<br><br>
etafilcon A, and the binding polymer is formed from linear random block copolymers of MAA,<br>
HEMA and lauryl methacrylate ("LMA"); linear random block copolymers of MAA and HEMA;<br>
linear random block copolymers of HEMA and LMA; or a HEMA homopolymer. Etafilcon A,<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,680,336 and 4,495,313 incorporated herein in their entireties by<br>
reference, generally is a formulation of 100 parts by weight ("pbw") HEMA, about 1.5 to about<br>
2.5 pbw MAA, approximately 0.3 to about 1.3 pbw ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, about 0.05 to<br>
about 1.5 pbw 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, and about 0.017 to about 0.024 pbw of a<br>
visibility tint. Preferably etafilcon A is used with a linear random block copolymer of MAA,<br>
HEMA and LMA in a ratio of 0.47 MAA to 100 HEMA to 4.14 LMA, or with a linear random<br>
block copolymer of HEMA and MAA in a ratio of 99.9 HEMA and 0.1 MAA to 99.5 HEMA<br>
and 0.5 MAA as binding polymer.<br>
[0064] A preferred method of manufacturing a tinted lens is carried out using pad<br>
printing as follows. A metal plate, preferably made from steel and more preferably from<br>
stainless steel, is covered with a photo resist material that is capable of becoming water insoluble<br>
once cured. The pattern for the colorant is selected or designed and then reduced to the desired<br>
size using any of a number of techniques such as photographic techniques, placed over the metal<br>
plate, and the photo resist material is cured. Conditions for carrying out the pattern etching are<br>
within the knowledge of one ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
[0065] Following the pattern, the plate is subsequently washed with an aqueous<br>
solution and the resulting image is etched into the plate to a suitable depth, for example about 20<br>
microns. The colorant is then deposited onto the pattern to fill the depressions with colorant. A<br>
silicon pad of a suitable geometry and varying hardness, generally about 1 to about 10 Shore A<br>
durometer units, is pressed against the image on the plate to remove the colorant and the colorant<br>
is then dried slightly by evaporation of the solvent. The pad is then pressed against the molding<br>
surface of an optical mold, transferring the colorant to the mold. The colorant is allowed to dry.<br>
The mold is degassed for a minimum of about 8 hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen<br>
after which the mold is filled with lens forming amount of a lens material. A complementary<br>
mold half is then used to complete the mold assembly and, after a period of diffusion during<br>
which the lens monomer diffuses into the printed image, the mold assembly is exposed to<br>
conditions suitable to cure the lens material used.<br>
[0066] The invention will be clarified further by consideration of the following, non-<br>
limiting example.<br>
Example (typical enhancer lens)<br><br>
[0067] A colorant composition containing a binding polymer (made from lauryl<br>
methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid), pigments and isopropyl<br>
lactate, l-ethoxy-2-propanol, and 1-propoanol, was pad printed onto the front curve molding<br>
surface of a polystyrene optical mold. The mold was degassed by placing it in a nitrogen<br>
environment for at least 8 hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the mold was<br>
filled with a lens-forming amount of etafilcon A monomer mix. A complementary mold half<br>
was then used to complete the mold assembly.<br>
[0068] The mold assembly was placed onto a belt that passes through a cure tunnel, the<br>
inside of which tunnel was mounted 4 sets of 2, side-by-side, short wave IR lamps at the<br>
beginning of the tunnel. In this tunnel, the mold assembly passed under the IR bulbs and was<br>
heated to the Tg of the colorant. Control of the intensity of each bulb was maintained by a<br>
microprocessor-based temperature controller. The mold assembly then passed into a dark zone<br>
in which no bulbs were present, but in which heaters heated the air to between 55 and 75°C to<br>
maintain the mold temperature at or above the colorant Tg. The mold passed through the IR bulb<br>
and dark zone of the tunnel at a speed so that it remained in this zone for about 75 seconds<br>
during which time the Tg temperature was maintained by a continuous feedback system that<br>
monitored the mold temperature. The mold then exited this zone and photochemical curing of<br>
the lens material was initiated and completed. Once curing was completed, the mold assembly<br>
was separated with the lens remaining in the front curve mold. The front curve molds were<br>
placed in trays, trays were placed in a magazine, and the magazine was placed in the first<br>
hydration solution. The first hydration solution contained DI water at 70-80°C with 800 ppm<br>
Tween 80 and 103 ppm EDTA. Upon insertion into the first solution the lens swelled slightly<br>
(
solution for at least 80 and not more than 232 minutes. The lenses were then transferred to a<br>
45°C tank containing borate buffered saline, containing water with 0.85% NaCl, 0.93% boric<br>
acid, and 0.18% sodium borate (by weight). The lenses were kept in this tank for greater than<br>
156 minutes during which time the acid groups in the lens polymer de-protonated. The lenses<br>
were then transferred to a third tank containing DI water at 70°C with 800 ppm Tween 80 and<br>
103 ppm EDTA. Lenses were kept in the third tank between 45 and 70 minutes during which the<br>
diameter of the lenses increased to 18.1 mm. The lenses were then transferred to a fourth tank<br>
identical to the second of borate-buffered saline at 45°C, in which the lenses returned to their<br>
functional size of 14.0 mm. The lenses stayed in the fourth tank a minimum of 156 minutes.<br>
The process is summarized in Table 1.<br>

WE CLAIM:<br>
1.	A method for removing excess material from a contact lens having a<br>
functional size, comprising:<br>
swelling said contact lens through contact with a first liquid to provide a<br>
swollen contact lens that is larger than said functional size; and<br>
shrinking said swollen contact lens through contact with a second liquid.<br>
2.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said first liquid and said<br>
second liquid have different ionic strengths.<br>
3.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein said first liquid has a greater<br>
ionic strength than said second liquid.<br>
4.	The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein said first liquid, said second<br>
liquid, or both comprise a buffered aqueous solution.<br>
5.	The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said first liquid, said second<br>
liquid, or both comprise sodium chloride, boric acid, sodium borate,<br>
dihydrogen sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate or any combination thereof.<br><br>
6.	The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein said buffered aqueous salt<br>
solution comprises 0.01 percent to 10 percent by weight salt.<br>
7.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said second liquid comprises<br>
distilled water or deionized water.<br>
8.	The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the ionic strengths of the first<br>
liquid and the second liquid differ by 3 to 30 milli-Siemens/cm.<br>
9.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said swelling step introduces<br>
greater than 5 percent more water into said contact lens.<br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said swelling step increases<br>
the diameter of said contact lens by at least 1 mm.<br>
11.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said contact lens comprises a<br>
soft contact lens comprising from 0 to 90 percent water.<br>
12. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said swelling, said shrinking,<br>
or both are performed for 2 minutes to 400 minutes.<br><br>
13. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said swelling, said shrinking,<br>
or both are performed at a temperature between 5 and 95°C.<br>
14. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said contact lens further<br>
comprises a diluent and said method further comprises removing said<br>
diluent from said contact lens.<br>
15.	 The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein said diluent is removed prior<br>
to said swelling.<br>
16.	 The method as claimed in claim 14, wherein said contact lens swells<br>
during said diluent removal.<br>
17. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said contact lens is tinted.<br>
18.	The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said contact lens comprises a<br>
HEMA-based hydrogel.<br>
19.	The method as claimed in claim 18, wherein said HEMA-based hydrogel is<br>
etafilcon A.<br><br>
A method for removing excess material from a contact lens having a functional<br>
size, comprising:<br>
swelling said contact lens through contact with a first liquid to provide a swollen<br>
contact lens that is larger than said functional size; and<br>
shrinking said swollen contact lens through contact with a second liquid.</td>
