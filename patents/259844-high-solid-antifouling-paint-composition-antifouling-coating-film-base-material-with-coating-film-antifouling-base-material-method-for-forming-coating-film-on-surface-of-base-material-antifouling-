HIGH-SOLID ANTIFOULING PAINT COMPOSITION, ANTIFOULING COATING FILM, BASE MATERIAL WITH COATING FILM, ANTIFOULING BASE MATERIAL, METHOD FOR FORMING COATING FILM ON SURFACE OF BASE MATERIAL, ANTIFOULING METHOD FOR BASE MATERIAL, AND HIGH-SOLID MULTI-PACKAGE ANTIFOULING PAINT COMPOSITION SET<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a high-solid antifouling paint composition, more particularly a high-solid antifouling paint composition used for forming an antifouling coating film that exhibits an excellent antifouling performance and the like on a surface of a base material such as an underwater structure, an outside board of a ship, a fishing net, and a fishing gear, with reduced environmental burden and reduced effect on human bodies, use thereof, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART The bottom of a ship, fishing nets, pipings for supplying/draining seawater, underwater structures and the like are sometimes damaged in their appearances and functions, upon exposure to water over a long period of time, due to attachment and proliferation of various aquatic organisms such as animals<br><br>
ike oysters, mussels, barnacles and the like, plants such as lavers and the like, or bacteria and the like on their surfaces.<br>
Particularly, when such aquatic organisms attach to the ship bottom and proliferate, the surface roughness of the ship bottom increases, possibly leading to decrease in ship speed and increase in fuel consumption. Moreover, a huge amount of labor and working hours are required for removing such aquatic organisms from the ship bottom. Furthermore, when aquatic organisms attach to fishing nets such as aquaculture nets, set nets and the like, and proliferate there, the mesh of the nets is clogged, possibly leading to a significant problem such as dying of living catches from lack of air and the like.<br>
Furthermore, attachment and proliferation of aquatic organisms on pipings for supplying/draining seawater possibly causes troubles in distribution and circulation of cooling water in thermal and atomic power stations or the like.<br>
In order to prevent these damages, ship bottoms and the like have conventionally been coated with, for example, a paint containing a copolymer of tributyltin methacrylate with methyl methacrylate or the like and cuprous oxide (Cu20) as an antifouling paint excellent in antifouling performance. The copolymer in this antifouling paint is a "hydrolyzable self-polishing paint", that is, the copolymer hydrolyzed in seawater, releasing organotin compounds such as bis(tributyltin) oxide (tributyltin ether,<br><br>
Bu3Sn-0-SnBu3; Bu represents a butyl group), a tributyltin halide (Bu3SnX: X represents a halogen atom) or the like, to exhibit an antifouling effect, and the hydrolyzed copolymer itself, which has become water-soluble, is also dissolved into seawater. Accordingly, no resin remains on the coated surface of the ship bottom, and thus the surface can be always kept active.<br>
A solvent-based paint, which has been generally used as a paint, is now under a worldwide restriction as a source of environmental pollution because such a paint releases a large amount of organic solvent in the air. As an environmentally friendly paint, a high-solid paint, a water-based paint, a powder paint and the like have been developed. However, there has been developed no antifouling paint having both a high antifouling performance and a high coating flim performance with a reduced content of organic solvent.<br>
Examples 1 to 3 of Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. S52-32928 (Patent Document 1) discloses an antifouling paint composition containing a copolymer of (meth)acrylic acid with methyl methacrylate or the like, zinc acetate, and others. Examples 4 9 to 54 of Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. H2-196869 (Patent Document 2) disclose an antifouling paint composition containing a methacrylic acid/ ethyl methacrylate/ methoxyethyl acrylate copolymer, and copper naphthenate or zinc rosinate.  Neither of them provided coating films with a<br><br>
sufficient antifouling performance.<br>
Japanese Patent No. 3040094 (Patent Document 3) discloses an antifouling paint composition containing a metal-containing resin formed from a carboxyl group-containing resin such as acrylic resin and the like, and a metal-containing antifouling agent.  Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. S62-501293 (Patent Document 4) discloses an antifouling paint composition using a carboxyl group-containing polymer that contains, typically, about 10% to 35% by weight of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid monomer. Any of these antifouling paint compositions had a problem in storage stability over time and a difficulty in reducing the volatile organic compound content (VOC) to a low level.<br>
Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 2002-241676 (Patent Document 5) discloses, as an antifouling paint of high-solid type, an antifouling paint that contains a varnish of a metal-containing acrylic resin having, in the side chain of the acrylic resin, at least one group represented by formula (1) below:<br>
O —(JO,,—C—0—M—(A)m      (l)<br>
(in the formula, X is a group represented by the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
n is 0 or 1; Y is hydrocarbon; M is metal; m is an integer given by subtracting 1 from the valency of metal M; and A is an organic acid residue derived from a monobasic acid), wherein the antifouling paint has a non-volatile content of 40% by weight or more, a viscosity (25°C) of 18 poise or less, and an organic solvent content (VOC) of 400 g/L or less. However, this antifouling paint had extremely poor coating workability because of its too high viscosity. Therefore, a coating film was hard to form, and the formed coating film had difficulties such as a low stationary antifouling performance and a low wearing degree.<br>

present invention.<br>
[High-solid Antifouling Paint Composition]<br>
The high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention contains a specific carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) (hereinafter, also called "copolymer (A)"), a polyvalent metal compound (B) capable of reacting with the carboxyl group of the copolymer (A) , and an antifouling agent (C) , and may further contains another ingredient (s) such as a defoaming agent and the like as necessary.<br>
Firstly, each ingredient will be explained. <br>
The specific carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) used in the present invention has a structural unit derived from an unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al) and a structural unit derived from an other unsaturated compound monomer (a2) copolymerizable with the unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al) , and has a weight average molecular weight of 1,000 to 6,000 as measured with GPC.<br>
As the unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al), any publicly-known monomer may be used, provided it is a compound having a carboxyl group (s) and a polymerizable double bond, including a monobasic acid and a polybasic acid.<br>
Specifically, examples of the monobasic acid (monocarboxylic acid) include<br><br>
(meth)acrylic acid;<br>
a reaction product of 2-hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate and an acid anhydride, such-as 2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl succinate, 2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl phthalate, 2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl hydrogen tetrahydrophthalate, and 2-(meth)acryloyloxypropyl hydrogen hexahydrophthalate; and<br>
a monoester derived from a dibasic acid anhydride, such as monomethyl itaconate, monoethyl citraconate, and<br>
monoisopropyl maleate; and others.<br>
In the present invention, a dimer, a trimer or an oligomer of (meth)acrylic acid, which is formed by Michael Addition of (meth)acrylic acids, may be used as the unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al).<br>
Examples of the polybasic acid include maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, citratonic acid and the like.<br>
Examples of the other unsaturated compound monomer (a2) copolymerizable with the unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al) include an alkyl (meth)acrylate such as methyl (meth)acrylate and ethyl (meth)acrylate, and derivatives thereof (for example, a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate, an alkoxyalkyl (meth)acrylate, an alkylpolyoxyalkylene (meth)acrylate, and a<br>
hydrogenpolyoxyalkylene (meth)acrylate) ; styrene and styrene derivatives; a vinyl ester such as vinyl acetate and vinyl<br>
propionate; (meth)acrylamide and derivatives thereof; and (meth)acrylonitrile; and others.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) is 1, 000 to 6, 000, preferably 1, 300 to 5,500, more preferably 1,500 to 5,000, and particularly preferably 1,500 to 2,500, as measured with GPC in terms of polystyrene. When the weight average molecular weight of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) is within the above range, an environmentally friendly and excellent antifouling paint having a reduced amount of organic solvent can be obtained. The conditions for GPC measurement are as follows: Apparatus: HLC-8120GPC manufactured by Tosoh Corp., Column: Super H2000+H4000, 6 mm I. D., 15 cm,<br>
manufactured by Tosoh Corp., Eluent: THF,<br>
Flow rate: 0.500 mL/min, Detector: IR, and Column oven temperature: 40°C. Desirably, the viscosity at 25°C of a solution containing carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) with a non-volatile content of 50% by weight is 800 mPa-s or less, and preferably 600 mPa-s or less; and the viscosity at 25°C of a solution containing carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) with a non-volatile content of 70% by weight is 20,000 mPa-s or less, and preferably<br>
10,000 mPa-s or less. If the viscosity of the solution with a non-volatile content of 50% by weight is 800 mPa-s or more, it tends to be difficult to prepare an antifouling paint composition that has a volatile organic compound content (VOC) of 4 00 g/L or less and is coatable, and the antifouling paint composition, even if prepared, tends to have a poor antifouling performance.<br>
In order to make the viscosity of the solution of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) with a non-volatile content of 70% by weight not more than 20,000 mPa-s and to prepare an coatable antifouling paint composition with not more than 400 g/L of VOC, it is desirable that the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) is produced using a radical polymerization initiator in an amount of 10 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the monomers.<br>
As the radical polymerization initiator, a conventional publicly-known initiator, such as an azo compound, a peroxide and the like, may be used. Examples of the azo compound include 2,2 -azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) ,<br>
2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) and the like. Examples of the peroxide include benzoylperoxide, tert-butylperoxy acetate, tert-butylperoxy octoate, cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butylperoxy benzoate, tert-butylperoxy 2-ethylhexanoate, tert-butylperoxy isopropyl<br>
carbonate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, persulfate (potassium salt or ammonium salt) and the like.<br>
The radical polymerization initiator may be added to a reaction vessel either as a homogeneous dispersion in a monomer mixture or separately from the monomer mixture on production.  If necessary, the radical polymerization initiator may be used as a solution or slurry.<br>
Method for Producing Carboxyl group-containing Copolymer (A)<br>
The carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) can be produced by solution polymerization method. As a solvent for the solution polymerization, an appropriate solvent that can dissolve or disperse the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) may be used. Either water or an organic solvent may be used; however, it is desirable to use a versatile organic solvent for paints, considering-drying property of the paint composition.<br>
Examples of the versatile solvent for paint include an aliphatic solvent such as turpene; an aromatic solvent such as toluene and xylene; an alcoholic solvent such as isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, and isobutyl alcohol; an ester solvent such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; a ketone solvent such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and methyl amyl ketone; an ether or ether-ester solvent such as ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether, and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate; and others.<br>
These solvents may be used alone or in combination of two or more. These solvents may be used in an arbitrary ratio with respect to the monomer mixture, and may be added during or after reaction as appropriate. In order to obtain the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) having a lower molecular weight, polymerization is carried out in a large amount of solvent, and after that unnecessary solvent may be distilled off as necessary.<br>
In terms of easiness in polymerization and simplicity in using for the paint composition, the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) is preferably produced by radical solution polymerization method in a solvent, and in production it is desirable that a radical polymerization initiator is used in an amount of 10 parts by weight or more, and preferably 20 to 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total amount of the raw monomers (not including the weight of the radical polymerization initiator itself).<br>
For the reaction, one may use a publicly-known molecular weight modifier including a chain-transferring agent such as an alkylmercaptan, a polymerization modifier such as α-methylstyrene and α-methylstyrene dimmer<br>
(2,4-diphenyl-4-methyl-l-pentene) and the like, as necessary. The reaction temperature is preferably 50°C to 250°C, and<br>
more preferably 80°C to 200°C.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at a high temperature under positive pressure so as to obtain the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) with a lower molecular weight.<br>
In view of water resistance and a long-term antifouling performance of a coating film formed from the paint composition of the present invention, in the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) (100% by weight) , the content of the structural unit derived from the unsaturated carboxylic acid monomer (al) is preferably 5 to 50% by weight, more preferably 10 to 40% by weight, and particularly preferably 15 to 35% by weight; while the content of the structural unit derived from an other unsaturated compound monomer (a2) is preferably 95 to 50% by weight, more preferably 90 to 60% by weight, and particularly preferably 85 to 65% by weight.<br><br>
The polyvalent metal compound (B) reacts with the carboxyl group of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A), and functions as a curing agent.<br>
In the reaction between the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) and the polyvalent metal compound (B) , a metal salt crosslinking structure (for example, -COO - M2+•0"CO-) will be formed from -COO" group, which is a group generated by elimination<br>
of a hydrogen ion from the carboxyl group of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) , and the polyvalent metal ion Mx+ (x represents the valency of metal element M).<br>
In some cases, the reaction between the polyvalent metal compound (B) and the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) (carboxyl group therein) can be recognized, for example, by the change in color of the solution before and after the polyvalent metal compound (B) is mixed with the solution of the copolymer (A) .  In some cases, the progress of reaction can be confirmed by comparing the IR spectra of the copolymer (A) before and after mixing, that is, by decrease in the absorption band assignable to 0-H stretching of carboxyl group in 3,000 to 3,500 cm-1 after mixing, by decrease in the absorption band assignable to C=0 stretching of carboxyl group around 1700 cm-1 after mixing, or by increase in the absorption band assignable to C=0 stretching of metal carboxylate around 1600 cm-1 after mixing.  Further, in some cases, the progress of reaction can be confirmed by viscosity increase of the solution of the copolymer (A) with time after mixing.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent metal include copper, zinc, magnesium, calcium, germanium, aluminum, cobalt, iron, titanium, and the like. Among them, zinc, copper, germanium, magnesium, calcium, cobalt, and aluminum are preferred. Copper and zinc are particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of the polyvalent metal compound (B) include oxides, hydroxides, halides, inorganic acid salts such as carbonates and sulfates, and organic acid salts such as acetates and salicylates of the aforementioned metals. Oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, and organic acid salts are preferred, and oxides and hydroxides are more preferred.<br>
The polyvalent metal compound (B) is.preferably an oxide (s) of at least one kind of polyvalent metal selected from the group consisting of zinc, copper, germanium, magnesium, calcium, and cobalt, more preferably zinc oxide and/or cupric oxide, and particularly preferably zinc oxide.<br>
Zinc oxide with a various particle size may be used. Fine particulate zinc oxide such as activated zinc white and the like is preferably used because of advantages including that the reaction between the carboxyl group of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) and zinc oxide is more promoted than a case with coarse zinc oxide, whereby the hardness of coating film increases in a shorter time and the coating film develops damage resistance in an earlier stage.<br>
In the antifouling paint composition of the present invention, the content of the polyvalent metal compound (B) is preferably 1 to 500 parts by weight, and more preferably 5 to 400 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A).<br>
The content of the polyvalent metal compound (B) is 0.1 to 500 moles, and preferably 0.5 to 400 moles per mole of carboxyl group of the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A).<br><br>

The antifouling agent (C) is preferably at least one kind of copper compound (cl) selected from the group consisting of cuprous oxide, copper thiocyanate, and copper pyrithione, in view of antifouling effect on a wide range of organisms. In order to reinforce the antifouling performance of the copper compound (cl) , it is preferred to use at least one kind of organic antifouling agent (c3) selected from the group consisting of zinc pyrithione, pyridine-triphenylborane complex,<br>
4-isopropylpyridine-diphenylmethylborane complex, and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one together with the copper compound (cl).<br>
In view of being heavy metal-free antifouling agents containing no copper compounds, preferred is at least one kind of organic antifouling agent (c3) selected from the group consisting of zinc pyrithione, pyridine-triphenylborane complex, 4-isopropylpyridine-diphenylmethylborane, and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
In the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention, one kind of antifouling agent may be used alone as the antifouling agent (C), but it is preferred that a plural<br>
kinds of antifouling agents be used in a specific combination. The preferred specific combinations include followings:<br>
(i) a combination of zinc pyrithione, and pyridine-triphenylborane complex or 4-isopropylpyridine-diphenylmethylborane complex;<br>
(ii) a combination of zinc pyrithione and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one;<br>
(iii) a combination of a copper compound (cl) and at least one kind of organic antifouling agent (c3) selected from the group consisting of copper pyrithione, zinc pyrithione, pyridine-triphenylborane complex,<br>

4-isopropylpyridine-diphenylmethylborane complex, and 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
In combination (vi), zinc pyrithione is preferably used as the organic antifouling agent (c3), and it is also preferred to use zinc pyrithione in combination with pyridine-triphenylborane complex or 4-isopropylpyridine-diphenylmethylborane complex; and to use zinc pyrithione in combination with 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
In these specific combinations, the combinations containing no cuprous oxide result in reduction of environmental burden and in good appearance of the antifouling coating film, which is coated on a ship and contacts with water surface, without discoloration caused by alternation of cuprous oxide into basic copper carbonate.<br>
The combinations containing cuprous oxide result in good antifouling performance of the antifouling coating film in various sea areas because cuprous oxide is effective in stable antifouling performance.<br><br>
The high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention may further contain at least one kind of additive (D) selected from the group consisting of water (dl), an acetoacetyl (CH3COCH2CO-) group-containing compound (d2), an alkoxysilane compound or a derivative thereof (d3) , a dispersant (d4), an anti-sagging agent (d5), a plasticizer (d6), an extender pigment<br>
(d7) (except the polyvalent metal compound .(B) )  a color pigment<br>
(d8), and a dehydrating agent (d9).<br>

(dl) Water<br>
When the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention contains water (dl), the reaction between the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) and the polyvalent metal compound (B) is promoted, whereby the hardness of coating film can increase in a short time and the coating film attains damage resistance in the early stage.<br>
The reaction between the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) and the polyvalent metal compound (B) is also promoted by moisture in surroundings of the place where the coating film is applied (that is, moisture in the air or the like). Nevertheless, when water (dl) is intentionally blended in the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention, it is desirable that water (dl) is blended in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight, and preferably 0.02 to 5% by weight, in 100% by weight of the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention (excluding solvent (E) described later),<br>

(d2) Acetoacetyl Group-Containing Compound<br>
Examples of the acetoacetyl group-containing compound (d2) include acetylacetone, acetoacetylethyl methacrylate and the like.<br>
When the acetoacetyl group-containing compound (d2) is blended in the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention, the acetoacetyl group-containing compound (d2) works as a chelating agent to the polyvalent metal compound (B) . Consequently, viscosity of the antifouling paint composition is lowered and rapid progress of the reaction between the carboxyl group-containing copolymer (A) and the polyvalent metal compound (B), which is caused by blending of water (dl), is suppressed. As a result, the pot life of the paint composition of the present invention can be extended. Considering the effect of extending pot life and proper adjustment of the drying ability of the coating film, the acetoacetyl group containing compound (d2) is preferably blended in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight in 100% by weight of the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention (excluding solvent (E) described later) .<br>

Considering the promotion effect on the reaction, preventive effect on ease in mixing the ingredients, and drying ability and water resistance of the coating film, it is desirable that the alkoxy silicate (d3) is blended in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight, and preferably 0.02 to 5% by weight, in 100% by weight of the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention (excluding solvent (E) described later).<br>

When the dispersant (d4) is used, in the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention or, when<br><br>
the composition is a multi-package type, in the first liquid, the second liquid, and the third liquid optionally used, and the like used for preparing the multi-package type composition, the solvent-insoluble ingredients are homogeneously dispersed to prepare a paste-form composition containing the solvent-insoluble components and the solvent.  In addition, the dispersant (d4) can prevent coagulation of the solvent insoluble ingredients on storage of the first, second, and third liquids. Further, when the high-solid multi-package antifouling paint composition of the present invention is prepared by mixing the first, second, and optionally third liquids and others, the solvent-insoluble ingredients are easily dispersed homogeneously in the composition.<br>
It is desirable that the dispersant (d4) is blended in an amount of 0. 01 to 60% by weight, and preferably 0.1 to 40% by weight, in 100% by weight of the high-solid antifouling paint composition of the present invention (excluding solvent (E) described later) .<br>

The chlorinated paraffin (chloroparaffin) may be either straight-chain or branched, and may be either liquid or solid (powder) at room temperature.  Suitably used chlorinated paraffins each has, an average of, generally, 8 to 30, and preferably, 10 to 26 carbon atoms; a number average molecular weight of, generally, 200 to 1,200, preferably, 300 to 1,100; a viscosity of, generally, 1 poise or more, preferably, 1.2 poise or more at 25°C; and a specific gravity of 1.05 to 1. 80, preferably, 1.10 to 1.70 at 25°C.  By using the chlorinated paraffin having the above number of carbon atoms, the resulting antifouling paint composition can form a coating film less suffering from cracking and peeling off. When the number of carbon atoms in the chlorinated paraffin is less than 8, the preventive effect against cracking may be insufficient. When the number of carbon atoms exceeds 30, the resulting coating film surface may have poor wearing property (renewability) and hence a poor antifouling performance. The chlorination ratio (chlorine content) of the chlorinated paraffin is generally 35% to 75%, and preferably 35% to 65% from the viewpoint of that the resulting antifouling paint composition can form a coating film less suffering from cracking<br>
