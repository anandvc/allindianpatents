				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to irrigation devices and more particularly to a novel arrangement for pumping fluids, namely water, at minimal cost using only human power.<br>
Brief Description of the Related Art<br>
Generally classifiable as "manual water pumps", prior art approaches include centrifugal, reciprocating and diaphragm pumps. Centrifugal pumps use a rotating turbine to suck and propel water. Reciprocating pumps use a piston in a back-and-forth motion within a cylinder. Diaphragm pumps use the displacement caused by the deformation of a flexible diaphragm to suck and propel water.<br>
Limitations with the prior art pumps, such as U.S. Patent No.s 2,074, 787, 4,173,431 and 5,118, 265 include the following: prior art hand operated pumps use one-cylinder and do not provide a pressure head, or the ability to push water above the position of the pump itself. Hand operation is not as ergonomically efficient as foot operation. However, prior art foot-operated pumps use two cylinders, two pedals/treadles and a number of pivots, thus, increasing their overall cost. Specifically, many require expensive custom-machined or cast components. Furthermore, almost all of the aforementioned prior art pumps have a number of fasteners (bolts, washers, screws, latches, etc.), which commonly rust, rendering them useless over time.<br>
Thus a solution is needed which overcomes the above problems and limitations of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes the aforementioned problems of the prior art. Specifically, one of several aspects of the present invention is to assist in lifting and pushing water at minimal cost and using only human power.<br>
These and other aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with regard to the following description and accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is embodied in the configuration, method of operation and/or article of manufacture, generally shown in the Figures. It will be appreciated that the apparatus, method of operation and/or article of manufacture may vary as to the details of its configuration and operation without departing from the basic concepts disclosed herein. The following description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.<br>
Novel features of one embodiment of the subject invention include the following:<br>
Layout or orientation of the pump 100. The present solution comprises one or more dual-action (suction and pressure) cylinders 102 slightly off-center on a transverse see-saw-style rocker 104 with one foot on either end. This allows use of the legs, minimizes the number of pivot points 114 required and allows provision of a pressure head.<br>
An outlet valve 126 design provides quicker and more efficient operation along with a large flow area. Pretensioned by the concave lower valve seal support surface, it ensures quick closing even at low pressure heads. The present solution also allows the user to change the valve seal from the inlet side of the valve, without fasteners, obviating the need to open the valvebox to change the valve seal.<br>
An inlet valve design which allows the present solution to be changed without the use of fasteners, while still providing a large flow area.<br>
Fastenerless construction. Fasteners are not used in the present solution.<br>
The built-in surge chamber 108. This chamber 108, on either or both the suction and pressure side of the pump 100, facilitates smooth water flow.<br>
Portability of the pump. The present solution is portable and completely free-standing.<br>
A multi-position handle 110. A multi-position handle can be placed in any one of multiple positions, allowing the user to find his/her most comfortable position and even to switch when tired. This is all the more important since the ratio of effort needed on each side of the rocker 104 depends on the ratio of the pressure and suction heads.<br>
A contoured footpad 112. The footpad is contoured to allow continuous comfort and maximum pumping efficiency.<br><br><br>
For a thorough description of the present invention, reference is now made to the detailed embodiments of the invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
