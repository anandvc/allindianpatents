				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to adapting ferritic stainless steel rods with Type 430 grade<br>
(17% Chromium), which are not generally weldable grades. More particularly,<br>
the invention relates to a friction welding procedure adapting ferritic stainless<br>
steel rods with post-weld annealing cycle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DIFFICULTIES OF PRIOR ARTS<br>
Welding of ferritic stainless steel (FSS) rods is very much required for automobile<br>
and general structural components. Brittleness of FSS welds was found in the<br>
existing procedure without post-weld annealing. Due to its poor weldability (grain<br>
coarsening and poor toughness, poor ductility in FSS weld and heat affected<br>
zone), FSS are not preferred but instead (three times costly) the austenitic<br>
stainless steel (ASS) rods are being used in industries.<br>
Not many research papers and patents are available in the field of welding of<br>
FSS 430 rods. One of the research papers by Ginn (1980) studied the non-fusion<br>
welding process such as friction welding of austenitic stainless steel components<br>
for its toughness behaviour. Friction welding is a popular process for joining of<br>
machine components, which are all in the cylindrical shapes.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a friction welding procedure<br>
for ferritic stainless steel rods.<br><br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a friction welding procedure for<br>
ferritic stainless steel rods, in which a post-weld annealing heat treatment cycle<br>
is implemented to improve the toughness and ductility of the FSS weld samples.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a friction welding procedure for<br>
ferritic stainless steel rods, which includes a bend test to confirm the reduction in<br>
weld zone hardness of FSS weld samples.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent<br>
from the ensuing description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
For industrial FSS applications friction welding process was established. Due to<br>
brittleness in FSS welds the use of FSS are not very common in industries. The<br>
proposed post-weld annealing was done at 800°C for two hour soaking time and<br>
it was found to improve the ductility of the FSS welds. Generally post-weld<br>
annealing is not carried out for solid-state welding process. But due to poor<br>
ductility in FSS rods, post-weld annealing was introduced in this invention. The<br>
heating rate was maintained at 200°C per hour in the furnace. The FSS weld<br>
samples were cooled in the furnace upto 500°C at the cooling rate of 150°C per<br>
hour. Afterwards air cooling was carried out from 500°C upto room temperature.<br>
This procedure achieved good toughness, ductility in FSS welds. Post-weld<br>
annealing parameters and friction welding procedures were optimized. During<br>
post-weld annealing cycle, FSS weld samples experience the redistribution of<br><br>
chromium in weld and heat affected zone, reduction in hardness, internal<br>
stresses are relieved and the improvement in weld ductility was achieved.<br>
Post-weld annealing of FSS friction joint results were found lower in weld zone<br>
hardness - 180 Hv compared to the 360 Hv hardness of as-welded samples.<br>
Friction welds exhibited good impact toughness value of 60 J/mm2, compared to<br>
the base metal impact toughness value of 78 J/mm2. Excellent bend ductility was<br>
observed in the bend test after post-weld annealing. With this new method of<br>
post-weld annealing for FSS rods was established using friction welding process.<br>
The problems of poor weldability, poor weld toughness and poor weld ductility<br>
were improved in this invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig. 1 - schematically shows a friction welding process including the sequences<br>
of friction welding of round components with the application of external pressure<br>
for proper welding.<br>
Figure 2 graphically shows the post-weld annealing heat treatment cycle for FSS<br>
rods, including peak temperature : 800°C, soaking duration : 120 minutes,<br>
cooling upto 500°C in furnace.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Friction welding is a solid phase welding process in which joining of metals is<br>
produced at a temperature lower than the melting temperature of the two parts<br>
being joined. This is a method of welding in which the "welding" heat is<br>
generated by sliding or rubbing together of two mating surfaces under pressure.<br>
The sequence of operations necessary to produce a friction weld of rods is<br>
shown in Figure 1. High quality, mass production, dissimilar metal joints are<br>
made and no weld consumables are used in this method. Automobile axle,<br>
engine exhaust valves, twist drills, pump shafts and valve flanges are the most<br>
common industrial components that are welded by friction welding process.<br>
A new method of welding procedure with post-weld annealing cycle and testing<br>
of weld details are given below : -<br>
In this invention friction welding process was selected for welding of FSS rods for<br>
structural and automobile components in industries.<br>
The benefit of friction welding process helps to achieve very tiny interface and<br>
fine grain size in the fusion zone with 5-10 microns compared to 400 microns in<br>
welds made by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process. Metallurgically, the<br>
friction weld quality is superior since no fusion related defects are taking place.<br>
An interesting concept of friction welding was attempted to join FSS rods with 14<br>
mm diameter. Continuous drive friction welding was done and the optimum set<br>
of friction weld parameters were selected based on the weld quality, tensile<br><br>
strength and the location of failure (at base metal region). The test results,<br>
microstructural features, post-weld annealing and fracture surface studies of<br>
weld samples are analysed. Friction welding does not involve melting, but the<br>
weld zone is mechanically worked ; therefore the bond region is made of finer-<br>
grained microstructure than that is found in the FSS base metal.<br>
Friction welding parameters with post-weld annealing, tensile test results are<br>
established. Using these as base parameters, further optimization of welding<br>
conditions was done using a statistical factorial design procedure. Optimised<br>
friction weld base parameters are completed. Hence it can be expected to<br>
achieve better weld metal properties in FSS through friction welding than that<br>
can be resulted by fusion welding processes. For confirming the friction weld<br>
parameters, it was ensured that during the examination of macrostructure, the<br>
cut section of the weld should have uniform flash at top and bottom of weld,<br>
parallel weld width in the cross section and complete bonding to be observed at<br>
the centre of the joint. After the initial set of welding trials, tensile tests were<br>
conducted to assess the quality of welds. It was found that many of the tensile<br>
test samples failed at weld zone and only few weld samples failed in the base<br>
metal region. Tensile strength, hardness and impact toughness of welds were<br>
evaluated.<br>
The weld joints were tested to get the tensile strength of the joints. The results<br>
of the tensile test of the joints in the as-received condition are established. To<br>
study the effect of ductility and toughness of the joints, post-weld annealing was<br>
carried out. Some of the weld joints, failed at the weld region during tensile test.<br>
Though the tensile strength of joint was higher than that of base metal, the<br><br>
failure at the joint was due to coarse grains and the weld defects such as very<br>
fine pores, resulting in cleavage brittle fracture. The tensile test, notch tensile<br>
test, static shear test, impact test, bend test, macro, micro-examinations and<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM) fracture surface studies were carried out to<br>
assess the quality of the friction weld joints. With the optimum set of weld<br>
parameters, sufficient tensile strength of the welds was obtained. Failure<br>
occurred at the base metal region and not at the joint.<br><br>
