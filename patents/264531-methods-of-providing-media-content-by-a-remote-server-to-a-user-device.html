				<td>SYSTEM FOR THE DELIVERY AND DYNAMIC PRESENTATION OF<br>
LARGE MEDIA ASSETS OVER BANDWIDTH CONSTRAINED<br>
NETWORKS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001] 1. Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to delivering and presenting high quality,<br>
media based content, to users or processes over networks, with assured Quality of<br>
Service (QOS) even if insufficient network bandwidth is available.<br>
[0003] 2. Description of the Background Art<br>
[0004] The inventors have recognized that even with advances in network<br>
technologies, delivering rich, high quality experiences will remain a challenge. In<br>
particular, delivering large media assets - whether they be audio, video, flash,<br>
games, data or other digital media formats - often requires more network<br>
bandwidth/throughput than is available. For instance, in the case of audio and video,<br>
a high bit rate asset can only be delivered in real time if a user's effective bandwidth<br>
is at least equal to the asset's bit rate, otherwise the result is a sub-optimal user<br>
experience complete with stutters, stops, and content buffering.<br>
[0005] On the other hand, a large game executable may not have the same real<br>
time constraints (or required quality of service) as a video, however downloading the<br>
asset requires a significant amount of time and overhead for the user, even on the<br>
fastest networks. While a number of "download managers" on the market will take<br>
care of this for the user, a content provider may wish to intelligently and adaptively<br>
manage the download of assets to the user device (e.g., a computer, a set-top box<br>
with memory and/or processor, a device) in an elegant and transparent manner,<br>
without needing the attention of the user.<br>
[0006] Given this, there is a need to manage and deliver large, high quality media<br>
assets to users using their limited bandwidth in a time shifted manner. That is, there<br>
is a need to be able to unobtrusively deliver content to users via available bandwidth<br>
and idle cycles, so that when the high quality content is needed, it is readily available<br>
on demand and an uncompromised user experience is rendered. This in turn<br>
provides the illusion that the user has more effective bandwidth than is actually<br>
available. To this end there is also a need for this technology to integrate<br>
seamlessly into delivery and presentation platforms (including but not limited to web<br>
browsers, flash and other platforms) and content publishing systems. The present<br>
invention achieves this and other functionalities and also overcomes the limitations<br>
of the prior art.<br>
[0007] For ease of understanding, the following definitions will apply throughout<br>
this application; however, no definition should be regarded as being superceding any<br>
art-accepted understanding of the listed terms.<br>
[0008] Glossary:<br>
[0009] 1. Throughput - The amount of data transferred from one place to another<br>
in a specified amount of time. Typically, throughputs are measured in kbps, Mbps<br>
and Gbps.<br>
[0010] 2. Quality of Service, QOS - The term that specifies a guaranteed<br>
throughput level.<br>
[0011] 3. Client Process - The process on the client that receives cache/display<br>
management directives or hints from a server process and then executes directives<br>
to bring the cache current state in line with desired state and may trigger one or<br>
more notifications to users or other process's as it does so.<br>
[0012] 4. Cache - A store of assets with "known" availability or QOS. A cache in<br>
this context is an asset storage mechanism where the QOS meets the content<br>
requirements and is in general higher than the medium used to acquire the assets.<br>
State changes within the cache may result in notifications.<br>
[0013] 5. Server Process - Provides the client with the information required for the<br>
client to manage the state of the cache. In its most simple implementation it is<br>
similar to a quasi dynamic server generated play list. More elaborate<br>
implementations (all of ours) also provide control directives for the client to inform<br>
other process's of progress against specific sets of assets.<br>
[0014] 6. Expiration date - expiration date of asset, and indicates when the asset<br>
should be removed from the local cache.<br>
[0015] 7. Callback URL - a URL that is retrieved once the asset item has been<br>
downloaded.<br>
[0016] 8. Client-side Token - a token or cookie to set when the item has been<br>
downloaded. This allows a client or server application to determine the presence of<br>
an asset on the local system.<br>
[0017] 9. Embargo Date - This indicates the latest date the asset will be used.<br>
[0018] 10. Delete - This indicates that the asset is to be marked for explicit<br>
deletion (to override the expiration date). This allows for retraction of an asset.<br>
[0019] 11. Refresh rate - determines how often a client checks an asset list for<br>
changes.<br>
[0020] 12. Resource path - the network location of any number of resources<br>
associated with the asset list.<br>
[0021 ] 13. Media Assets - at least one of a text, audio, video, or binary file/data.<br>
[0022] 14. Item - a single media file.<br>
[0023] 15. Link-URL for the media file.<br>
[0024] 16. hitCountUrl - URL to ping after the file has successfully downloaded. A<br>
parameter, duration, will be appended to the end of the URL indicating, in seconds,<br>
how long the download took.<br>
[0025] 17. helpUrl - URL for the client process help that is to be displayed when<br>
the user selects help menu item,<br>
[0026] 18. trackWithCookie - optional element that, If present, indicates this asset<br>
will be added to the list of assets in the cookie specified by cookieName.<br>
[0027] 19. cookieName - name of the cookie that lists all downloaded assets that<br>
have the trackWithCookie element present. This cookie is essential for ad serving<br>
so the ad server knows which ads have been downloaded. The format of the cookie<br>
will consist of the name only of the files (no extension or path) separated by<br>
commas,<br>
[0028] 20. cookieDomain - domain on which to set the downloaded assets cookie.<br>
Multiple domains can be specified if separated by semi-colons or commas.<br>
[0029] 21. /regserver - registers the ActiveX controls with the system and adds<br>
the client process to the startup folder<br>
[0030] 22. /shutdown - stops another running instance of the client process, if<br>
present.<br>
[0031] 23. /unregserver - unregisters the ActiveX controls and removes the<br>
shortcut from the startup folder. Also stops the running instance of clientprocess.exe<br>
and removes COM object registry entries.<br>
[0032] 24. CDN - Content Distribution Network. A federated group of content<br>
servers owned and operated by a 3rd party. In general practice a CDN service<br>
provide additional capacity using a highly decentralized collection of servers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0033] The present invention provides for a system and method by which media<br>
content is delivered from a content provider to a local cache of a user device, based<br>
on a predetermined set of constraints, prior to viewing the media. An asset list<br>
comprises information related to the media assets to be downloaded to the client<br>
device, and is transmitted from the content provider to the user device. The asset<br>
list, for example contains URL's or information related to the location of the media<br>
assets.<br>
[0034] A client asset manager process resides in the user device and is<br>
responsible for downloading assets from the content provider. The asset manager<br>
uses the asset list to request media assets which are located at a remote site. The<br>
client process manages delivery of assets to the user device, periodically, when<br>
specific constraints are met. For example, assets are delivered to the user when<br>
there is optimal network bandwidth availability, user device memory, assured quality<br>
of service, etc.<br>
[0035] The present invention thereby provides a continuous, uninterrupted, and<br>
substantially seamless display (visual and auditory) of media content by efficient<br>
delivery of the media assets to the users. By integrating these assets with a viewing<br>
means (e.g., a web-browser), the user is provided an uninterrupted and continuous<br>
stream of media content that does not require real-time buffering.<br>
[0036] The present invention furthermore provides improved methods for delivering<br>
one or more large media assets, for instance, audio content, video content, movies,<br>
games etc., intelligently and adaptively, over a network to a local asset store. As<br>
such, the local asset store is available to a client, or end-user, device and where a<br>
relatively high quality of service is to be assured. The invention also includes an<br>
adaptive method of combining these assets into an essentially seamless<br>
presentation based on local availability of the assets.<br>
[0037] The present invention comprises a method for delivering an asset over a<br>
network. The method comprises supplying an asset list over the network to a user<br>
device. The method further comprises a client which operates on a user device.<br>
The client refers to the asset list in downloading and delivering the asset to the user<br>
device. The client further manages downloading the assets based on when at least<br>
one predetermined constraint is satisfied.<br>
[0038] A content provider can place a digital asset on a user's device a priori, so<br>
that it is immediately available for use, without a network download, when the user<br>
needs it. This can happen when explicitly requested by a user or process, or be<br>
initiated by a content provider based on a subscription service.<br>
[0039] The invention is further described with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0048] A. General Description<br>
[0049] A continuous, uninterrupted, and substantially seamless display (visual and<br>
auditory) of media content, by efficient delivery of the media assets is provided to<br>
users. Specifically, assets are delivered to a user device, periodically, when specific<br>
constraints are met (e.g., network bandwidth availability, user device memory,<br>
assured QOS, etc.) By integrating these assets with a viewing means (e.g., a webbrowser),<br>
the user is provided an uninterrupted and continuous stream of media<br>
content that does not require real-time buffering.<br>
[0050] One or more large media assets, for instance, audio content, video content,<br>
movies, games etc., are delivered intelligently and adaptively, over a network to a<br>
local asset store. As such, the local asset store is available to a client, or end-user,<br>
device and where a relatively high QOS is to be assured. There is also an adaptive<br>
method of combining these assets into an essentially seamless presentation based<br>
on local availability of the assets.<br>
[0051] One example of a local asset store, where the QOS is assured, could be a<br>
cache or a data storage facility offered by Local Area Network (LAN) to which the<br>
user device is connected. By local availability it is meant that an asset is available<br>
on a local to end user or process storage system (or a local store, with a high speed<br>
network in between the client device and the local store).<br>
[0052] In one embodiment a process or application runs on a user's device, herein<br>
referred to as the client. The client is responsible for managing a cache of content<br>
on the user's local store. Applications, web pages and multimedia presentations can<br>
then rely on this cache to incorporate large media assets that are already resident.<br>
Applications, web pages and multimedia presentations can query the cache about its<br>
content and dynamically tailor user experiences around the content that is available.<br>
These applications may be client or server side applications.<br>
[0053] The client may be a service that is downloaded from the Internet and<br>
installed in the user's device. The client may alternatively be provided as a core<br>
component of a computer operating system, or come bundled with other software<br>
applications.<br>
[0054] The client manages a cache of media assets for the end user. In one<br>
implementation, the assets included in the cache are dictated by an asset list<br>
provided by a content provider. In this implementation, the client retrieves the asset<br>
list at specific and tunable time intervals from a network location. Based on the<br>
information in the asset lists, the client manages the download of assets from a<br>
remote location when predetermined constraints are satisfied.<br>
[0055] A client is allowed to be associated with more than one asset list, so that<br>
many service providers or multiple business units of one service provider can<br>
separately maintain their own asset lists and make use of the same client to manage<br>
the downloads. Also, the client may be made aware of the location of an asset list<br>
when the client is installed or updated. The install is initiated from a web page. If the<br>
client is not yet installed in the client device, software in the web page detects this<br>
and prompts the user to download and install the client. It is also possible to add an<br>
asset list to the client through scripting (combined with ActiveX controls) in a web<br>
page.<br>
[0056] The client manages the download of assets based on predetermined<br>
constraints. As has been mentioned thus far, predetermined constraints include, for<br>
example, network bandwidth availability, user device memory, time of day, and<br>
assured quality of service. For instance, in one implementation of the client,<br>
downloads only occur when the user device is idle. In another implementation, the<br>
client process downloads only when network activity is below a certain level. In<br>
another instance, the client process measures the CPU and memory usage on the<br>
user device, and the predetermined constraint is met when usage is below certain<br>
performance levels. In yet another instance the client process manages the<br>
downloading of assets based on the time of day, and statistically when network<br>
usage is lowest. The client process can of course, additionally utilize any<br>
combination of constraints to manage the download of assets.<br>
[0057] The download capability can be switched on and off by the user. The user<br>
can also specify that downloads only happen when the device is on certain networks<br>
(for example on a LAN versus a dialup connection). For example, a user may<br>
subscribe to a content service whereby assets are downloaded (by the client) in the<br>
late evening hours for morning viewing.<br>
[0058] Furthermore, intelligent and adaptive management of assets is possible<br>
without the need for an explicit "download manager" under control by a user. By<br>
intelligently, it is meant that the assets are delivered to the client when some<br>
predetermined constraints are satisfied (e.g., bandwidth of the network, time of day,<br>
QOS, etc.). By adaptively, it is meant that the asset lists, at the content provider site<br>
or the user device site, are automatically updated based on user viewing<br>
preferences.<br>
[0059] Asset lists are used as a means for content producers to publish and<br>
manage content on client's local store. Thus, this functionality allows content<br>
producers to publish media assets that will at some point later be integrated into the<br>
presentation of an Application, web page or flash-based presentation. In one<br>
instance the producers enter information about an asset including its location, dates<br>
of presentation and text &amp; related information that may be associated with the asset<br>
into a backend publishing system. This information is then published and<br>
incorporated into the relevant asset lists. The publishing system may also<br>
(immediately or at_a certain date and time in the future) publish a web page or<br>
presentation that incorporates the asset.<br>
[0060] One method for delivering asset over a network includes: (i) supplying an<br>
asset list by a content provider over the network to a client, wherein the client<br>
process operates on a user device; and (ii) delivering the asset, corresponding to the<br>
asset list, over the network to the user device when predetermined constraints are<br>
satisfied. As an example, the asset could be at least one of a binary data, an audio<br>
content, a video content, a textual content, or a multimedia file. The predetermined<br>
constraints could include the time of day, the user device status (i.e., whether the<br>
device is being used or is idle), bandwidth usage (i.e., whether the bandwidth usage<br>
is below a predetermined operating level, the user device CPU usage, the user<br>
device memory usage (i.e., whether the memory usage is below predetermined<br>
operating levels). In addition, the asset could be stored in the local cache of the user<br>
device. Furthermore, the client may integrate the stored asset with the real time<br>
content, from the content provider, in a seamless fashion to provide an uninterrupted<br>
and seamless presentation of content to the user. Moreover, the asset list can be<br>
updated frequently, thereby providing the client process (or cache) with the ability to<br>
receive a wide variety of content periodically based on the predetermined<br>
constraints.<br>
[0061] The system provides to a user an uninterrupted stream of content<br>
comprising: (i) an asset list made available by a content provider over the internet to<br>
a client process, wherein the client process operates on a device of the user; (ii) an<br>
asset, made available from a remote location, over the network to the user device<br>
when predetermined constraints are satisfied, wherein information of the remote<br>
location is obtained from the asset list; and (iii) an integrator tool for integrating the<br>
delivered asset with a content stream being received by the user device from the<br>
remote location over the internet. The user is presented with an uninterrupted and<br>
continuous stream of content.<br>
[0062] The producer can enter alternative low-bandwidth media assets and<br>
corresponding textual information, which can then be combined in the backend with<br>
the information on the rich media assets to produce two different versions of the<br>
page (one for users that for whatever reason have not been able to download the<br>
large assets and one for the rich media assets). Users may not be able to download<br>
the rich media assets for a number of reasons, such as (1) incompatible system (2)<br>
their systems haven't been online to receive the downloads (3) they haven't paid for<br>
a premium service (4) they have insufficient disk space (5) they have been using the<br>
computer and didn't want it's resources used for downloading. As such, the ability to<br>
deliver an alternative experience in either case is important.<br>
[0063] Content along with advertising can be delivered, for instance, in a<br>
sequenced fashion, only allowing the content to be played when a corresponding<br>
advertisement also exists in the local cache. In one embodiment this is achieved by<br>
using (client or server-side) scripting to determine if both media assets exist on the<br>
user's device (the content piece and the advertisement). In another embodiment,<br>
this functionality is achieved by using the asset list bundles, which sets a token when<br>
both assets are on the local device.<br>
[0064] The user can actively specify the media that is downloaded and cached on<br>
the local device. In one implementation, this is achieved by a server-side database<br>
that manages an asset list for each user. For instance, in the middle of the week, a<br>
user might specify they'd like to watch a feature length DVD quality movie that<br>
weekend. This would result in an asset being added to their asset list and result in<br>
the client downloading the asset over time. The user may be charged to add the<br>
asset to this list, or (see below) digital rights management may be used to control the<br>
asset. In another instance, this method is combined with a "push" from the content<br>
provider as follows: to watch a late night news broadcast every morning a user<br>
subscribes to a service. As a result, the service inserts a new asset into the user's<br>
asset list each evening to identify the new show to be downloaded.<br>
[0065] Furthermore, the system may work with ISP and cable provider co-location<br>
delivery facilities. In one implementation, when a producer publishes an asset it is<br>
then moved to an ISP and cable provider collocation delivery facility or system<br>
(which is close to the user in network geography). The client retrieves that asset and<br>
places it in local cache by retrieving it ISP and cable provider collection delivery<br>
facility or system rather than the service providers source media servers.<br>
[0066] In addition, a content provider can optimize the user experience based on<br>
the assets at hand. For instance, a news related web site may provide a photo of a<br>
news story if no rich media asset is available, however if a video asset is stored<br>
locally, the web page may substitute the video in place of the image on the web<br>
page. This may include the corresponding textual "copy" of the video, as the video<br>
and image may not be of the same story and thus would require different supporting<br>
text and captions. In one embodiment this is accomplished by having the serverside<br>
application detect the presence of the asset via it's corresponding asset token<br>
(see asset lists attributes above). Depending on whether or not the token is present<br>
a different page is created for the end user. In another embodiment this is done on<br>
the client side via scripting in the web browser. That is, by using scripting in the web<br>
page a different page is created via dynamic HTML based on the existence of the<br>
media assets token.<br>
[0067] One advantage provided by the invention is that it allows a content provider<br>
to optimize its network bandwidth usage. Specifically, by increasing delivery of<br>
content when usage falls below peak, the valleys of bandwidth use are filled such<br>
that bandwidth use is optimized.<br>
[0068] In another aspect, digital rights management (DRM) schemes can be<br>
applied to the data flows. For instance, the DRM protected asset could be published<br>
through the invention. Thus, when the user "plays" the asset, they are prompted to<br>
acquire the appropriate license as a "right-to-use" the content.<br>
[0069] In another aspect, GAME assets can be distributed in the form of real or<br>
virtual ISO images that may be used on the client.<br>
[0070] B. Set-Top Box Example<br>
[0071] The client may download and manage media assets related to media<br>
content from different sources such as a TV set-top box, wherein the assets are<br>
delivered on a sideband of a carrier signal or through a data network, such as a<br>
cable or satellite network or the Internet or an intranet. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, viewers at home have access to a library of movies, or any other<br>
audio/video content available for viewing at anytime. Specifically, the method<br>
involves transmitting media assets, such as movies, to a set-top box in one's home<br>
and allowing movies to accumulate.<br>
[0072] A hard disk drive in the set-top box is used to store movies. The movies are<br>
transmitted using a datacasting technology which transmits large amounts of data<br>
over standard broadcast television signals. Information related to the datacasting<br>
technology is found in Application number WO9955087 to Hartson et al. filed on<br>
April 16,1999 and published Oct. 28,1999, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. For example, in a 24-hour period, this datacasting technology can<br>
distribute 20 high-quality feature-length movies. The set top box is easily connected<br>
to the user's television just as any other external device such as a VCR or DVD<br>
player. The set-top box is also connected to a phone line for billing purposes.<br>
 [0073] In an exemplary embodiment, the set top box is located in a person's home,<br>
connected to their television using standard video cables. The set top box has an<br>
antenna which receives data via the broadcast television signal. The set top box<br>
has, preferably, at least an 80 Gigabyte hard drive for storing a plurality of movies.<br>
The set-top box has a modem which the set-top uses to periodically contact the<br>
service provider. Information passed between the service provider and the set-top<br>
includes: the users "Viewing/Rental History" which is used for billing purposes, settop<br>
performance logs which are used to monitor the performance of the system and<br>
"Movie Keys" which are used decrypt the movies.<br>
[0074] The set-top box has a processor which is capable of receiving the data<br>
stream from the broadcast signal, reassembling data, and writing data to the hard<br>
drive. The processor must also be capable of simultaneously playing a movie and<br>
reacting to infrared signals from the remote control as well as modem activity. The<br>
hard drive is mated with the set-top box for security purposes, rendering it useless if<br>
removed and used anywhere else. The set-top box preferably does not have a fan<br>
as it is designed to be very quiet. The set top box also comprises a secure<br>
processor as part of its security system. The secure processor is the active<br>
component of a smart card which is physically attached to the PCB with epoxy to<br>
make it physically hard to tamper with.<br>
[0075] Movies are not "streamed" to the set-top box in real-time, instead content<br>
files are "packetized" and these "packets" are continuously transmitted to the set-top<br>
box where they are incrementally reassembled. The user is not aware of what data<br>
is being sent to their set-top box. The movies are pushed down by the provider to<br>
reside passively in the box for a finite time period. Transmission of the data is<br>
controlled by the content or service provider. To ensure that movies are received in<br>
their entirety, the same movie may be broadcast to the set-top box several times.<br>
Any packets of data that were not received in the first attempt of transmission will be<br>
received with subsequent broadcasts. In the perspective of the present invention, a<br>
client process resides on the set-top box and the media assets (movie content) are<br>
retrieved from the remote site when predetermined constraints (e.g., network<br>
bandwidth, QOS) are satisfied.<br>
 [0076] Movies transmitted to the set-top box may also have associated information<br>
that defines certain characteristics of the movie. For example, a movie may have an<br>
associated start and end date or time which limits the time period in which a movie<br>
can be viewed. For example, a movie may arrive and be stored in the set-top box,<br>
however it may have a start date associated with it which does not allow it to be<br>
viewed until that date. This allows for any discrepancies in transmission times for<br>
movies that may vary from one location to another, and also allows for movies to be<br>
"pre-loaded" and immediately available on the official release date. Similarly, the<br>
asset list may have an end date associated with a movie, after which date the movie<br>
can no longer be viewed, and is automatically deleted from the set-top box.<br>
[0077] Movies stored on the set top box are encrypted. Upon selection of a movie<br>
to view and satisfaction of business rules (ie: the user has sufficient credit), the set<br>
top box allows for the movie to be decrypted and played. The set-top box does not<br>
need to connect to the service provider prior to allowing a movie to be viewed, since<br>
the keys for decrypting the movies are typically pre-fetched and resident on the settop<br>
along with the current account status. Obviously, the encrypted movies cannot<br>
be viewed without decrypting them. All decryption is logged and this log is used to<br>
determine a user's bill. The logic surrounding decryption and user account status is<br>
handled by the secure processor. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a fee is charged to the user upon selection of the movie for viewing, a<br>
subsequent "rental confirmation" dialog and prior to viewing of the movie.<br>
[0078] In another embodiment, the user is billed for viewing a movie once a<br>
substantial portion of the movie has been viewed. Once a movie has been selected,<br>
it can be viewed again without charge for a limited period of time (e.g. 24 hours), or<br>
for a limited number of viewings. In another embodiment, instead of paying for each<br>
movie, the user is charged a monthly fee. The amount of the monthly fee will<br>
depend on various options such as the number of movies that can be viewed, the<br>
period of time that a selected movie is available for viewing, and the number of<br>
permitted viewings of each selected movie. A telephone line is used to effect<br>
transfer from the user of the information that a key is being sought by the user and<br>
thus a charge should be made. Thus, even though the user has a library of movies<br>
stored on the user's set-top box, there is no charge unless a movie is actually<br>
viewed.<br>
 [0079] In other embodiments, data can be transmitted to the set-top box by cable,<br>
satellite, internet, etc. Although wireless broadcast is a preferred embodiment, the<br>
present invention should not be limited to wireless transmission.<br>
[0080] C. Description In Relation To Drawings<br>
[0081] FIG. 1 shows a general overview of the system 10 used for delivering and<br>
presenting a media stream, without interruptions, on a user device. Specifically, the<br>
user device 20 includes an at least one client process 24 (e.g., a client asset<br>
manager process) that interacts with the client asset list 42 at a site of the content<br>
provider, depicted as 40. Also present, in the user device 20, is a local cache 26 for<br>
storing information. The cache 26 could be at least one of a random-accessmemory<br>
(RAM), a read-only-memory (ROM), or a hard drive. In addition, there could<br>
be present a remote site 60 that contains assets 62 such as program content (e.g., a<br>
sporting event, cooking show, etc.). As ah alternative, assets 62 could be located at<br>
the content provider site 40, or at a cable/internet-service provider (not shown). The<br>
asset is made available at the cable/ISP provider, before the client starts retrieving it.<br>
Furthermore, the client may retrieve the assets simultaneously from a plurality of<br>
physically separate locations (e.g., from a cable/ISP provider, content provider, etc.)<br>
[0082] The client process 24 manages a cache of media assets 26 for the end<br>
user. In one implementation, the assets 62 included in this cache 26 are dictated by<br>
an asset list 42 provided by a content provider 40 via data path 80. In this<br>
implementation, the client asset manager process 24 retrieves the asset list 42 at<br>
specific (and tunable) time intervals from a network location (such as the content<br>
providers site 40) via data path 80. Specifically, the client process 24 places a<br>
request, via the control signal pathway 84, to the content provider 40 to deliver an<br>
updated asset list 42 via the data path 80.<br>
[0083] Likewise, in another implementation, the asset list 42 could be sent to the<br>
end user client 24 by a server (not shown) of the content provider in a periodic<br>
manner. The asset list 42 is a data file that contains, at minimum, the list of content<br>
assets. Each element in the asset list 42 typically identifies a network location and<br>
protocol needed to obtain the asset. For example in one implementation this<br>
network location is a Universal Resource Locator (URL) and the protocol is HTTP.<br>
An asset list 42 may also contain other attributes (as explained in the summary<br>
section and defined in the Glossary section) associated with each asset, such as:<br>
[0084] (i) Expiration date, (ii) Delete;<br>
[0085] (ii) Callback URL - In one embodiment, this callback URL is used to initiate<br>
actions upon an asset's download, such as a tracking application (to allow tracking of<br>
which assets are downloaded and how often) and an application to notify the user<br>
via email or instant message that a particular asset is ready for viewing;<br>
[0086] (iii) Client-side Token - In one embodiment this is used to adapt the<br>
presentation based on the availability of assets;<br>
[0087] (iv) Throughput - In one embodiment this number is a percentage of<br>
available client throughput, and is less than 100%, the client can slow the download<br>
by attempting to get chunks of data only every so often rather than all at once. In<br>
another embodiment, this number is a download data rate in bytes per second;<br>
[0088] Embargo Date - Any content may be subject to a limited window of<br>
availability. Once the embargo data has been reached the content is removed by<br>
the client so that it is longer available.<br>
[0089] In one aspect, these assets can be combined into bundles of content. The<br>
above attributes can also be assigned to a bundle. For instance, this allows a client<br>
side token to be created once a set of media assets has been delivered to the user's<br>
device.<br>
[0090] Certain attributes can be associated with the entire asset list 42, such<br>
attributes being:<br>
[0091] (a) Refresh rate: In one implementation this could be controlled at the<br>
server side (e.g., at the content provider site 40), which would push the asset list 42<br>
to a client manager 24 via data path 80.<br>
[0092] (b) Resource Path, (c) Media Assets.<br>
[0093] FIG. 7 depicts one aspect of the hierarchical nature of the attributes in<br>
relation to asset information in the asset list. As shown, the asset list that is provided<br>
to a client, by the content provider/ISP, has attributes for all asset information. As an<br>
example, Attribute(1,2) may refer to the expiration date of Asset 1. The attributes, in<br>
this depiction, are local to each asset.<br>
[0094] In an alternative aspect, the attributes may be global to the asset list as<br>
shown in FIG. 8. In this situation, the client could manage the download of assets, in<br>
the asset list, based on the global attributes as applicable to all assets.<br>
[0095] The client 24 is also capable of managing many parameters of its asset<br>
download behavior from a remote site 60. For example, in one implementation, the<br>
client asset manager 24 initiates a request to the remote site 60, via signal 86, to<br>
transfer media assets 62 to the local cache 26 via data path 90. The client process<br>
24 can send these requests for data transfer (downloads) to the remote site 60<br>
based on whether a set of predetermined constraints are satisfied. For example,<br>
downloads could occur when the user device 20 is idle, when the network bandwidth<br>
is below a certain level, when the CPU and/or memory usage in the user device 20<br>
are below certain performance levels.<br>
[0096] The download capability can be switched on and off by the user. The user<br>
can also specify that downloads only happen when the device is on certain networks<br>
(for example on a LAN versus a dialup connection).<br>
[0097] The media assets 62 may be throttled or pushed by the remote site 60,<br>
depending on the network conditions (e.g., traffic, available bandwidth, time of day,<br>
etc.), without an initiating request from the client process 24.<br>
[0098] The asset lists 42 are used as a means for content producers to publish and<br>
manage content on client's local store/cache 26. For instance, this functionality<br>
allows content producers to publish media assets 62 that will at some point be<br>
seamlessly integrated into the presentation of a web page or flash-based<br>
presentation (not shown).<br>
[0100] Accordingly, the producers may enter information about an asset including<br>
its location, dates of presentation and text &amp; related information that may be<br>
associated with the asset into a backend publishing system. This information is then<br>
published and incorporated into the relevant asset lists. The publishing system may<br>
also (immediately or at a certain date and time in the future) publish a web page or<br>
presentation that incorporates the asset. The producer enters alternative lowbandwidth<br>
media assets and corresponding textual information, which can then be<br>
combined with the information on the rich media assets to produce two different<br>
versions of the page (one for users that for whatever reason have not been able to<br>
download the large assets and one for the rich media assets).<br>
[0101] The client asset manager process 24 an application that can run on the user<br>
device 20 to provide downloading and caching. Users would be able to opt-in,<br>
possibly through the content provider website, for obtaining the client<br>
manager/process. As an exemplary embodiment, the client manager could be<br>
installed to startup automatically and be running in the background.<br>
[0102] FIG. 2 displays another overview of the flow of information for the system<br>
100 where the client asset manager process 102 is running on a user device. In an<br>
exemplary depiction, a client asset list 110 (e.g., an XML file) is periodically<br>
downloaded from a content provider 120, and assets 130 listed in that file are<br>
downloaded from the remote site/content provider 140 and cached accordingly. The<br>
user may navigate to a web page that can display a asset(s), by including a script<br>
150 that communicates with the client manager process 160 Since the client<br>
manager process 102 could also be an ActiveX Server, only a proxy object could be<br>
running on the web page 180, and the actual control could be part of the client<br>
manager process 102. In an alternative aspect, the client process 160 could be<br>
embedded in the web page 180 or part of the client manager process 102.<br>
[0103] C(i). Design Perspectives<br>
[0104] The inputs may be: (i) configuration file such as an XML file that allows<br>
remote control over the behavior of client manager process 102; (ii) remote media<br>
files to be cached on the client. The outputs could be local paths to media files.<br>
[0105] Any web page can display an asset that is cached by the client 102. Using<br>
the client's ActiveX interface, a page could contain JavaScript code 150 to see if the<br>
client process 102 is installed, and ask the client for information regarding the local<br>
path for a media file. If a path is returned, the script could then pass this path<br>
information to any web based media player that accepts parameters.<br>
[0106] The configuration server 120 could be any web server that hosts the client<br>
configuration file 110. The media server 140 may be any web server that hosts the<br>
media files or assets 130,<br>
 [0107] C(ii). Execution Flow<br>
[0108] The client process 102 may be packaged in a .cab file and signed with a<br>
digital certificate to identify the creator of the program (e.g., the Walt Disney Internet<br>
Group). A separate .cab file, xyzvideo.cab, may be created for different content<br>
providers. For example, the filename could be espnvideo.cab for ESPN and it may<br>
be signed with the ESPN digital certificate. Internet Explorer uses the Internet<br>
Component Download feature to download and track the application. An .INF file<br>
could be included in the .cab to instruct the component down-loader as to how to<br>
install the client process 102.<br>
[0109] The .cab file is placed on a web server and when the browser loads a web<br>
page with an OBJECT tag containing the class id of the appropriate ActiveX control,<br>
it will download the .cab file using the URL specified by the CODEBASE attribute.<br>
The digital certificate is displayed to notify the user that our control has been<br>
downloaded and prompts for permission to execute. Once the user accepts, this<br>
window will not be displayed again unless an updated version is downloaded.<br>
[0110] The module, clientprocess.exe, is added to the Downloaded Program Files<br>
folder and the client may create a shortcut for itself in the Startup folder. The name<br>
of the shortcut is dependent upon who builds the file (e.g., Disney, ESPN, etc.). The<br>
client process 102 may also create a cookie on the go.com domain called<br>
ClientProcess which is set to true if the client process is installed. This cookie may<br>
be regularly checked to prevent it from being accidentally deleted by a user.<br>
[0111] The program is initially executed by the operating system and from that<br>
point it will run whenever the user device is booted up.<br>
[0112] The digital certificate, mentioned earlier, may be necessary since most<br>
users have their browser security settings high enough to disallow the installation of<br>
untrustworthy applications from the Internet. The presence of the certificate allows<br>
the browser to identify the origin of the software and ask the user whether that<br>
company or person should be trusted.<br>
[0113] The CODEBASE attribute of the OBJECT tag supports the optional addition<br>
of the desired version of the software to be installed. The version is appended to the<br>
URL of the location of the cab, with a '#' used as the separator. If, for example, the<br>
current version of client process in the field is 1,0,0,1 and a new version 1,0,0,2 has<br>
been put on the web server, appending '#1,0,0,2' at the end of the CODEBASE URL<br>
will direct the component downloader to download and install the new version.<br>
[0114] The .INF file contains a hook to first run clientprocess.exe with the<br>
shutdown parameter to first close clientprocess.exe so the update will not require a<br>
reboot.<br>
[0115] The component installer may add information to the registry using a<br>
predefined key.<br>
[0116] The menu for the client process system tray icon will contain an Uninstall<br>
option. When clicked, the client process will uninstall itself by running another<br>
instance of clientprocess.exe passing the /unregserver parameter. The uninstall<br>
process will do the following, (i) unregister the controls, (ii) cleanup the registry<br>
entries added by the client process, (iii) remove client process item from the Startup<br>
folder<br>
[0117] When the operating system starts and Explorer runs the items in the Startup<br>
Folder, the client process 102 will start. It may not terminate unless the user closes<br>
it from the system tray icon or the operating system shuts down.<br>
[0118] The client process 102 may not visible to the user except for a system tray<br>
icon containing a few menu items. If, for example, ESPN's BottomLine application is<br>
running, the ESPN version of the client process will not display its tray icon because<br>
BottomLine will provide the client process 102 some options in its menu. This is<br>
useful as it cuts down on the number of icons one could place in the tray on a single<br>
client. Programs such as BottomLine and the client process 102 may need to be in<br>
periodic communication with each other to ensure one is aware if the other shuts<br>
down and that the client process is aware if one of its menu items is selected. The<br>
icon will either be an ESPN icon or another icon depending upon the build.<br>
[0119] The following items will be in the client process tray icon menu: (i) Help -<br>
displays help for the client process 102, (ii) the XML group file can have an optional<br>
helpUrl item. When the user selects Help, a browser will be opened with this URL,<br>
(iii) About - shows program copyright/information dialog, (iv) Exit - stops the<br>
program (does not remove it from startup folder), (v) Uninstall - uninstalls the<br>
program and removes COM registry entries.<br>
 [0120] At least one instance of the client process 102 may run at a time. The only<br>
exception to this is if clientprocess.exe is run with the /unregserver or /shutdown<br>
parameter, that instance will terminate an already running instance, if it exists.<br>
Clientprocess.exe may achieve this single instance functionality by creating a shared<br>
mutex that is checked by subsequent instances of the program. Thus in some<br>
situations, if an existing instance is found, the second one will terminate immediately.<br>
[0121] The threading model for the client process could be the apartment model.<br>
This means the client process ActiveX controls are designed such that they expect to<br>
only be accessed from a single thread. However, the client process as a whole is<br>
multithreaded and will start a thread to perform a single asset download, terminate<br>
that thread and start another thread when the next download occurs. Only one<br>
download may occur at a time.<br>
[0122] During regular operating mode, the client process will run without any<br>
parameters. However, the following command line parameters could be supported:<br>
(i) /regserver; (ii) /shutdown - Stops another running instance of clientprocess.exe, if<br>
present; and (iii) /unregserver.<br>
[0123] The client process is configured using XML Group files that are downloaded<br>
from the configuration server. The URL of the group file is obtained through the xml<br>
PARAM tag within the OBJECT tag for the ClientProcessGroup ActiveX control on a<br>
web page. Every time a ClientProcessGroup control is initialized with an xml<br>
parameter, the client process checks to see if that group has already been added. If<br>
not, it is added to the registry and the file is downloaded and parsed. The registry<br>
entries for group files are not removed until the client process is uninstalled.<br>
[0124] The Group file is downloaded regularly according to its configurable refresh<br>
rate. If the server supports the If-Modified-Since header, the client process may not<br>
download the file if it has not been modified since the last download.<br>
[0125] The XML in the group file uses the RSS format with some additional client<br>
process specific elements. RSS is an open format for syndication that is used for<br>
many of Disney's feeds. The idea is to try to use as much of the standard as<br>
possible so that the group files could potentially be used by other systems.<br>
[0126] FIG. 3 shows an exemplary DTD for the group file.<br>
 [0127] Upon startup, the client process registers itself with the system as a COM<br>
Local Server for the following ActiveX controls. Only ClientProcessGroup is marked<br>
safe for initialization and only ClientProcessLocator is marked safe for scripting. This<br>
is to avoid use of the controls for malicious purposes. The initial prototype of<br>
ClientProcess was designed to have an ActiveX interface for each major component<br>
to allow a web page to display status. These interfaces are also very useful for<br>
troubleshooting during the development/testing phases.<br>
[0128] ClientProcessSvc:<br>
[0129] This is the main class of the application and is placed on the installation<br>
web page with an OBJECT tag to force the download and install of the application.<br>
There is a singleton instance of CCIientProcessSvc created for the process which<br>
tracks all asset and group objects created. The ICIientProcessSvc interface provides<br>
methods for reporting the status of the program.<br>
[0130] ClientProcessGroup:<br>
[0131] The ClientProcessGroup ActiveX control is used by JavaScript to assign a<br>
configuration file to the client process. Through the IPropertyBag interface,<br>
ClientProcessGroup accepts an OBJECT tag parameter, called either xml or source,<br>
which is set to the URL of the XML file. A single XML configuration (or group) file is<br>
represented by one ClientProcessGroup object. The ICIientProcessGroup interface<br>
provides status functionality.<br>
[0132] ClientProcessLocator:<br>
[0133] ClientProcessLocator is a simple control that is safe for scripting and has<br>
only one method, GetLocalPath. It is used by JavaScript in the web page that<br>
displays the media files to determine the path of the local file, if it has been<br>
downloaded.<br>
[0134] Furthermore if the user has stopped the client process and then navigates<br>
to a media page, the OBJECT tag containing the ClientProcessLocator class id will<br>
cause clientprocess.exe to execute again. If the user uninstalled the product, this<br>
tag will force a reinstall or an update if the CODEBASE parameter is specified.<br>
[0135] ClientProcessAsset:<br>
 [0136] ClientProcessAsset represents any object that is to be cached locally (group<br>
or media file). This COM Object is returned by the get_asset method in<br>
ClientProcessSvc or get_queuedAsset in ClientProcessDownloader.<br>
[0137] ClientProcessDownloader:<br>
[0138] A singleton ClientProcessDownloader is created when the application<br>
starts. It handles the download queue of assets. Assets add themselves to the<br>
queue with the QueueDownload method and when an asset comes to the top of the<br>
download queue, it is handed off to the CAsyncCacheDownloader instance for<br>
processing.<br>
[0139] ClientProcess Reference<br>
[0140] ClientProcessReference objects represent media files. Each group can<br>
have one or more references. This COM object is returned by the get_reference<br>
method in ClientProcessGroup.<br>
[0141] Other C++ Classes<br>
[0142] This section defines exemplary C++ classes in the client process application<br>
and summarizes their behavior and interactions with each other. Some of the<br>
classes have COM wrapper objects for communication with other applications. Fig.<br>
4 provides a table of the various classes.<br>
[0143] CAsyncCacheDownloader - asynccachedownloader.h/.cpp:<br>
[0144] This class encapsulates the downloading of assets to the local device via<br>
HTTP. CAsyncCacheDownloader subclasses CWindowlmpI to allow it to receive<br>
messages since most of its operations occur on a separate thread. The client<br>
process uses window messages for inter-thread communication.<br>
[0145] Most of its methods run on the main thread, but StartDownloadQ creates a<br>
new thread which, in turn, calls the DoDownloadQ method. DoDownloadQ uses<br>
Winlnet APIs to download a single asset and create an Internet Explorer cache entry<br>
for it.<br>
[0146] The DoDownload method will download the file in small chunks at a time. It<br>
will also sleep after each chunk if the configured throughput is below 100%. For<br>
example, if throughput is 50%, the download thread will sleep for the same amount<br>
of time it took to download the chunk to achieve an average of 50% throughput.<br>
[0147] CCacheAsset - cacheasset.h/.cpp:<br>
[0148] A CCacheAsset instance represents a single file that needs to be cached on<br>
the local system. This could either be a group file or a media file (reference). Both<br>
CCacheGroup and CCacheReference instances instantiate a CCacheAsset instance<br>
to handle the downloading and caching of the file. The Getlnterface method returns<br>
the ClientProcessAsset interface pointer of its respective COM wrapper object.<br>
[0149] If a download is unsuccessful, CCacheAsset will set a timer to try again<br>
according to the table of Fig. 5. If the download is successful, CCacheAsset<br>
watches the file system to make sure the cache item is not deleted from the cache.<br>
If it is, the item is downloaded again.<br>
[0150] CCacheGroup - cachegroup.h/.cpp:<br>
[0151] This class encapsulates the XML group file. Each Group XML file is passed<br>
to an instance of CCacheGroup that parses it and creates CCacheReference<br>
instances for each media file item. The Getlnterface method returns the<br>
ClientProcessGroup interface pointer of its respective COM wrapper object. A<br>
CCacheAsset instance is created to represent this group file and a timer is set with<br>
the interval set to the refreshRate specified in the XML. When the timer goes off, the<br>
CCacheAsset for the group file is added to the download queue.<br>
[0152] CCacheReference - cachereference.h/.cp:<br>
[0153] As the XML group file is parsed by CCacheGroup, a CCacheReference<br>
instance is created for each media file item. CCacheReference creates a<br>
CCacheAsset instance to handle the download/cache functionality. This class is<br>
also responsible for checking item expiration times and removing items from disk<br>
that have expired.<br>
[0154] CCacheTime - cachetime.h/.cpp:<br>
[0155] CCacheTime subclasses the ATL CTime class to provide time conversion<br>
functionality. All date/time member variables in the client process are stored using<br>
CCacheTime.<br>
 [0156] CCIientProcessModule - clientprocess.cpp:<br>
[0157] This class represents the executable process itself. CCIientProcessModule<br>
subclasses the standard ATL CAtExeModuleT class. The reason for this is to add<br>
functionality to the startup of the process as well as the register and unregister. At<br>
startup, a shared mutex is created using the ClientProcessSvc QUID as the name (to<br>
ensure uniqueness). If the mutex already exists, that means the application is<br>
already running, so the current instance exits. All the extra install and uninstall<br>
functionality is done in this class as well.<br>
[0158] CException - exception.h/.cpp:<br>
[0159] Instances of CException are created and thrown when errors occur.<br>
CException handles the formatting of an error.<br>
[0160] CRegistryVirtualDeviceX - registryvirtualdevicex.h:<br>
[0161] Subclass of CRegistryVirtualDevice in ATL. This class overloads<br>
AddStandard Replacements to stop ATL from checking the extension of the module<br>
to determine whether we should put lnProcServer32 or LocalServer32 in the registry.<br>
The client process is always an .exe and, therefore, a LocalServer, so the call may<br>
be unnecessary and added external requirements on the application.<br>
[0162] CTimer and CTimeable - timer.h/.cpp:<br>
[0163] CTimer encapsulates timer functionality. Any object that wishes to use a<br>
timer need only to inherit from CTimeable, implement OnTimer, create an instance of<br>
CTimer and call its Start method. StopQ stops the timer.<br>
[0164] CUrlMap - urlmap.h/.cpp:<br>
[0165] CUrlMap is a specialized CAtlMap template class that allows one to create<br>
hash map classes that map objects to URLs.<br>
[0166] More specifically, the system is further enhanced by: (i) adding download<br>
rate (throttling) support to download code, (ii) deleting assets when they expire, (iii)<br>
implementing ClientProcessLocator control and removing cookie logic, (iv) using a<br>
system tray icon and menu, (v) providing uninstall (removing executable, removing<br>
startup shortcut, cleaning registry), (vi) providing HitCountURL support, (vii)<br>
providing program information (an about dialog).<br>
 [0167] Care has been taken to ensure: (i) all proper ActiveX safety settings are<br>
applied to each control, (ii) COM methods and properties are hidden (this way they<br>
will not show up in control design user interfaces like Visual Basic), (iii) static function<br>
is used to poll the file system so only one timer is used, (iv) logic to BottomLine is<br>
added to detect ClientProcess and provide the System Tray icon submenu, (v)<br>
startup menu shortcut is used instead of windows run registry entry, (vi) regularly,<br>
check the cookie that indicates whether ClientProcess is installed and re-create it if<br>
necessary.<br>
[0168] C(iii). BottomLine Enhancements<br>
[0169] BottomLine (Trademark of ESPN) may need to be modified to detect the<br>
client process and, if present, display the client process menu items in its System<br>
Tray menu. This precludes having multiple icons in the tray if the user has both<br>
applications installed and running.<br>
[0170] The client process will define its menu item ids within the range<br>
CLIENTPROCESS_MENU_START and CLIENTPROCESS_MENU_END. These<br>
constants will be defined in a header file that is accessible to BottomLine when it is<br>
built.<br>
[0171] BottomLine and the client process need to be aware of whether each<br>
process is running so they will need to perform the following steps: (a) when<br>
BottomLine starts up, it tries to create the client process Mutex to see if the client<br>
process is running, (b) when the client process starts up or closes, it broadcasts a<br>
registered windows message that BottomLine sees and BottomLine will respond with<br>
an acknowledgement, (c) when BottomLine starts up or closes, it broadcasts a<br>
registered windows message that the client process sees and the client process will<br>
respond with an acknowledgement.<br>
[0172] Registered windows messages may allow applications to define their own<br>
unique messages for communication with other windows that also register the same<br>
message. When the client process or BottomLine announces its presence to the<br>
other application or acknowledges, it will pass along its window handle for future<br>
communication. Then the client process will use WM_COPYDATA to send to<br>
BottomLine the information to be displayed in the menu. When a client process<br>
menu item is select, BottomLine will forward it.<br>
 [0173] Some of the features also included with the system that implements the<br>
client process are: (i) ease of installation and updating (automatic), (ii) little or no<br>
client side user interface, (ii) server side configuration of the client program, (iii)<br>
control over rate at which files are downloaded, (iv) ability to track how many media<br>
files are downloaded, (v) ability to determine status of a media file download via<br>
JavaScript, (vi) ability to ship a version of the control that is content provider specific<br>
(e.g., ESPN specific) in its naming.<br>
[0174] C(iv). System Features<br>
[0175] Client Process Program:<br>
[0176] The client process program is responsible for downloading media content<br>
hours before it is to be displayed on the web page. When the user navigates to a<br>
page containing the HTML to display that file, the local copy of the file can be used,<br>
which will significantly improve playback quality.<br>
[0177] Installation:<br>
[0178] The client program may be allowed to install automatically. Any web page<br>
could contain a tag referring to the client process and the browser will automatically<br>
install it or update it, if necessary.<br>
[0179] User Interface:<br>
[0180] The user interface for the client program can be integrated into a system<br>
tray icon with a menu providing the ability to turn off or uninstall the product. If the<br>
BottofnLine application is present, its existing system tray menu may be used<br>
instead.<br>
[0181] Execution:<br>
[0182] The client process may be installed in the startup folder on the user's device<br>
so it will always be running. The program may regularly download an XML file from<br>
a WDIG server that will contain information about which assets to download, when<br>
they expire and at what rate to download them. There will also be an interface for<br>
content provider web sites to communicate with the client process to determine the<br>
location of local media files.<br>
[0183] Hosting:<br>
 [0184] The installation .cab file may be hosted by one or more head-ends provided<br>
by the Vertical using this product. Since it is a static file, it can be hosted by any web<br>
server. As new versions of the client process are released, this file will be updated<br>
on the server.<br>
[0185] Content Provider Bottom Line Modifications:<br>
[0186] Suitable modifications may be done to the BottomLine application to provide<br>
the system tray interface for the client process.<br>
[0187] Sample HTML and Script:<br>
[0188] Sample HTML and JavaScript may be provided to developers to<br>
demonstrate how to host and communicate with the client process.<br>
[0189] External Interface Requirements<br>
[0190] This section describes the external systems for which interfaces will need to<br>
be created or modified.<br>
[0191] ESPN BottomLine:<br>
[0192] Some minor changes may be made to BottomLine to detect the presence of<br>
the client process and add menu items to stop and uninstall the client.<br>
[0193] Client process detection:<br>
[0194] Each time the BottomLine menu is displayed, BottomLine must detect the<br>
presence of the client process and, if present and running, display a submenu<br>
containing the client process menu items. Detection of the client process is easily<br>
done by checking for the existence of a Mutex that the client process creates upon<br>
startup or by looking for a window that has the client process window class.<br>
[0195] Client process communication:<br>
[0196] If the client process is running, BottomLine may use windows messages to<br>
query which menu items to display. When a client process menu item is selected,<br>
BottomLine will use messages to tell the client process as to which item was<br>
selected.<br>
[0197] Media Content Server:<br>
 [0198] The server that hosts the media files may be any HTTP 1.1 web server<br>
which should support HTTP byte range downloading (206 success code) in order to<br>
enable download throttling. If the server does not support byte ranges, the entire file<br>
could be downloaded at once, regardless of configuration settings.<br>
[0199] Configuration Server Interface:<br>
[0200] There could be a server that hosts the XML configuration file. The XML<br>
may adhere to a format that is published in the design specifications.<br>
[0201] Functional Requirements<br>
[0202] 1. Setting a cookie on the user's device indicating the program is installed.<br>
This cookie could be periodically checked to make sure the user did not remove it.<br>
[0203] 2. Support software updates via Internet Explorer's Component Download<br>
facility will ensure client code is properly updated if a new version is placed on the<br>
head end and the HTML page is modified to request a more recent version. Also, it<br>
may be ensured that no rebooting is required upon refresh.<br>
[0204] 3. Program may be installed in the startup folder and, therefore, will always<br>
be running unless the user specifically stops it<br>
[0205] 4. Only one instance of the program will be running at once<br>
[0206] 5. Uninstall will be provided through a system tray icon menu. Uninstall<br>
may be from initiated outside the program,<br>
[0207] 6. Menu items provided by a system tray icon.<br>
[0208] 7. Help - displays help for Disney Cache<br>
[0209] 8. The configuration file can have an optional helpURL item. When the<br>
user selects Help, a browser will be opened with this URL.<br>
[0210] 9. About - shows program copyright/information dialog.<br>
[0211] 10. Exit - stops the program (does not remove it from startup folder).<br>
[0212] 11. Uninstall - uninstalls the program and removes registry entries<br>
[0213] 12. The configuration file: (i) may be in XML Format, (ii) may provide<br>
refresh rate for determining how often to download the configuration file, (iii) may<br>
provide per-item settings for the URL, expiration date, URL for hit tracking and the<br>
download rate. Furthermore, the priority of an item may determined by the order in<br>
the configuration file. Also, two different configuration files may not contain the same<br>
item with the same URL. In addition, information about the location of the XML<br>
configuration file could be located in the registry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br>
[0214] File Download<br>
[0215] Browser (e.g., Internet Explorer) Cache:<br>
[0216] The client process could use the Internet Explorer cache to provide client<br>
side caching of the media files. Files stored in the cache could be cleaned up by<br>
Internet Explorer, if necessary, to make room for other items. The XML configuration<br>
file, however, may be marked as sticky so it will remain on the hard drive for a<br>
certain period of time (e.g., 30 days). Since the Internet Explorer cache is on a per<br>
Windows login basis, each user is allowed to have a separate cache.<br>
[0217] The client process will need to check periodically (or use a File System<br>
watch) to detect when an item has been removed from the cache. If it has not yet<br>
expired, it will be downloaded again.<br>
[0218] Item Lifespan:<br>
[0219] Each item will have an expiration date and time. Periodically, the client<br>
process will check these times and delete any item from the cache that has expired.<br>
The client process needs to be sure to track assets that exist on the device so that if<br>
they are removed from the XML configuration file before the client had a chance to<br>
expire them, they will still get deleted from the user's hard drive (this could happen if<br>
the user has had their device off for an extended period of time).<br>
[0220] Once an item is downloaded, it will not be downloaded again unless Internet<br>
Explorer has removed it from the cache.<br>
[0221] Configuration Refresh:<br>
[0222] The client process will periodically refresh the XML configuration file by<br>
downloading it from the server at the rate specified by the refreshRate XML element.<br>
[0223] Download Errors:<br>
 [0224] If an error occurs when an item is being downloaded, after a timeout, the<br>
client process will try again. The amount of time to wait is dependent upon the type<br>
of error according to the chart provided in FIG. 6.<br>
[0225] Furthermore, the client process may perform downloads if network<br>
connectivity is available. If required, it may not perform a dialup to do downloads.<br>
[0226] Throttling:<br>
[0227] Each item in the configuration file can optionally be configured to have a<br>
specific download throughput percentage. This implies that the client process may<br>
download the file in pieces and pause between each piece to achieve this. The web<br>
server that hosts the file should be capable of supporting the HTTP byte range<br>
feature.<br>
[0228] Web Interface<br>
[0229] URL for configuration file may be passed to the client process via an<br>
ActiveX control property. ActiveX control will be safe for scripting and safe for<br>
initialization. The client process could check the server part of the XML configuration<br>
URL to verify it is from the go.com domain. This is to prevent malicious web pages<br>
from initializing the client process with potentially harmful data (large files<br>
downloaded often with small refresh rates). The OBJECT tag need not have a<br>
CODEBASE parameter so that the client process is not accidentally installed for<br>
someone who has not opted in. The JavaScript may have code to check whether<br>
the object exists before making any API calls and also check the installed cookie. At<br>
least one version of the client process can be installed on the client device.<br>
[0230] D. General<br>
[0231] The description of exemplary and anticipated embodiments of the invention<br>
has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. They are not<br>
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.<br>
[0232] Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the teachings<br>
herein. For example:<br>
[0233] (a) it may be possible to create a new component that provides generic<br>
System Tray icon support where installed client apps can register themselves to add<br>
menu items.<br>
 [0234] (b) The server-side user settings to determine the behavior of the client<br>
process. The client process would need a unique identifier that is tied to the user<br>
who installed it. Then the server could be more sophisticated and send different<br>
XML configuration files for different users.<br>
[0235] (c) Continuation of downloads that do not complete.<br>
[0236] (d) Adding more sophisticated download throttling (for example, taking the<br>
baseline client bandwidth measurement and using that for calculating throughput<br>
control).<br>
[0237] (e) Server-side smarts for determining server load based upon MRTG data<br>
and use that to decide to return 503 responses to the client process to prevent heavy<br>
load on asset download.<br>
[0238] It is evident that those skilled in the art may now make numerous uses and<br>
modifications of and departures from the specific embodiments described herein<br>
without departing from the inventive concepts. Consequently, the invention is to be<br>
construed as embracing each and every novel feature and novel combination of<br>
