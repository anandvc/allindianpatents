				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a series of non-peptide oxytocin agonists and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds. The compositions are useful for the treatment of certain physiological disorders, such as erectile dysfunction.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Neurophvseal hormones<br>
The neurophyseal hormones oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) are cyclic nonapeptides secreted by the posterior pituitary gland.   The structure of oxytocin is shown below.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Vasopressin differs from oxytocin in that it has phenylalanine at position 3 in place of isoleucine and arginine at position 8 in place of leucine. Both hormones are synthesised in vivo as larger precursors, neurophysins, which are subject to post-translational processing to release the mature peptides. OT and VP act through a family of heptahelical receptors.<br><br>
The first target organs to be identified for OT were the uterus, where it is implicated in the onset and progress of labour, and mammary glands, where it is involved in the regulation of milk expression. Other organs also express OT receptors, and it is clear that OT has a range of physiological roles that have not been fully elaborated yet. In particular, it has been suggested that OT acting in the CNS is involved in the erectile response in males, and in the regulation of female sexual arousal. For example, OT is erectogenic when administered i.c.v. to male rats. It also has erectogenic activity when given i.v., but the doses required are up to two orders of magnitude greater, which is consistent with a central mode of action.<br>
Oxvtocin agonists and antagonists<br>
A number of peptide analogues of OT are known in the literature. These include both agonists and antagonists. OT and its agonists are used, for example, to accelerate labour and to increase uterine muscle tone to control post-partum bleeding, and one antagonist, atosiban, has recently been registered as a treatment for pre-term labour. However, the peptidic nature of these compounds means that they are not likely to be bioavailable after oral dosing or to cross efficiently into the CNS. In order to get drugs that can be given orally and to be able to exploit the central effects of OT, attention has increasingly turned to non-peptides. As a result, there are many publications describing non-peptide OT antagonists in early-stage development. So far, however, there have been no reports of non-peptide OT agonists. This is not unexpected, as it is generally held that it is easier to find a receptor antagonist than an agonist.<br>
So there remains a need for non-peptide OT receptor agonists. Such compounds should preferably be selective for the OT receptor over the VP receptors. They could be expected to show therapeutic utility in male and female sexual dysfunction, particularly male erectile dysfunction, in promoting labour, in controlling post-partum bleeding, in increasing milk let-down as well as a number of other indications.<br>

The substituent R4 is selected from H, alkyl groups, optionally substituted phenyl, pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl and isothiazolyl groups, a group-(CO)-O-(CH2)eR8 where e is 1, 2, 3 or 4, a group -(CH2)eR8, where e is 1, 2, 3 or 4, -CH2-CH=CH-CH2-R8, -CH2-CsC-CH2-R8, -(CH2)g-CH(OH)-(CH2)h-R8, where g and h are independently 1 or 2,<br>

The group G1 is a disubstituted nitrogen such that the C(=O)-G1 bond is an amide bond. G1 is selected from an acyclic group according to general formula 2, a fused bicyclic group according to general formulae 3, 4 and 5, and a fused tricyclic group according to general formulae 6 and 7,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
In general formula 2, R5 and R6 are independently selected from alkyl, Ar and -(CH2)r-Ar, where f is 1, 2 or 3 and Ar is selected from thienyl and optionally substituted phenyl. Suitable substituents for the phenyl group are alkyl groups, OH, alkoxy groups, halogens, NH2, NH-alkyl and N(alkyl)2. The phenyl group may be substituted with up to three such substituents which may be the same or different.<br>
In general formula 3, A1 is selected from CH2, CH(OH), NH, N-alkyl, O and S. A2 is selected from CH2, CH(OH), C(=O) and NH, and c is 1 or 2, preferably 2. It is preferred that when A2 is NH then A1 is CH2. It is also preferred that when A2 is C(=O) then A1 is NH or N-alkyl.<br>
In general formulae 3, 6 and 7, A3 is selected from S, NH, N-alkyl, -CH=CH- and -CH=N- and A4 and A5 are each selected from CH and N. In a preferred embodiment, A3 is S and A4 and A5 are both CH, so as to form a thiophene ring. In another preferred embodiment, A3 is -CH=CH- and A4 and A5 are both CH, so as to form a benzene ring. In another preferred embodiment, A3 is -CH=N- and A4 and A5 are both CH, so as to form a pyridine ring. In another preferred embodiment, A3 is -CH=CH-, A4 is CH and A5 is N, again so as to form a pyridine ring.<br>
In general formulae 4 and 6, A6 is selected from CH2, NH, N-alkyl and O, A7 and A11 are selected from C and N, A8 and A9 are selected from CH, N, NH, N-(CH2)d-R7 and S and A10 is selected from -CH=CH-, CH, N, NH, N-(CH2)d-R7 and S, where d is 1, 2 or 3 and R7 is selected from H, F, CF3, alkyl groups, OH, O-alkyl groups, S-alkyl groups, O-acyl groups, amino groups such as NH2, NH-alkyl and N(alkyl)2l NH-acyl, N(alkyl)-acyl, CO2H, COz-alkyl, CONH2, CONH-alkyl, CON(alkyl)2, CN and optionally substituted phenyl groups.

The phenyl group may have up to three such substituents which may be the same or different.<br>
The ring constituted by A7, A8, A9, A10 and A11 is aromatic, and accordingly the groups must satisfy certain requirements. When A10 is -CH=CH- the ring is a six-membered ring. As such, it can only comprise atoms of the type -C(R)= and -N=. Hence A7 and A11 must both be C and A8 and A9 must be either CH or N. We have found that suitable activity is only obtained when A8 is N and A9 is CH. When A10 is not -CH=CH- then the ring is a five-membered ring. In this case one, and only one, of the atoms in the ring must be S or a trigonal nitrogen. In this context, a "trigonal nitrogen" is a nitrogen atom linked covalently to three different atoms. Two of these atoms are the immediate neighbours to the nitrogen atom in the five-membered ring. The third is a hydrogen, carbon or other atom linked to the five-membered ring. Thus it follows that, when A10 is not -CH=CH- then one (and only one) of A7, A8, A9, A10 and A11 must be S or a trigonal nitrogen. Hence the selection of A7, AB, AB, A10 and A11 is subject to the following restrictions.<br>
1)      If A10 is not -CH=CH- then one of A8, A9 and A10 is NH, N-(CH2)d-R7 or S or one of A7 and A11 is N.<br>
2)	Not more than one of A8, A9 and A10 may be NH, N-(CH2)d-R7 or S.<br>
3)	A7 and A11 may not both simultaneously be N.<br>
4)	Neither A7 nor A11 may be N if one of A8, A9 and A10 is NH, N(CH2)dR7 or S.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, A6 is NH. In another preferred embodiment, A8 is NH or N-(CH2)<r-r7. in a more preferred embodiment a8 is nh or n- a9 n and a10 ch.></r-r7.>
In general formulae 5 and 7, A12 and A13 are selected from N and C and A14, A15 and A16 are selected from NH, N-CH3, S, N and CH. Again, these atoms constitute an aromatic five-membered ring and so there must be one, and only one, S or trigonal nitrogen. Hence the selection of A12, A13, A14, A15 and A16 is subject to the following restrictions.<br>
1)	One of A14, A15 and A16 is NH, N-CH3 or S or one of A12 and A13 is N.<br>
2)	Not more than one of A14, A15 and A16 is NH, N-CH3 or S.<br>
3)	A12 and A13 may not both simultaneously be N.<br>
4)	If one of A14, A15 and A16 is NH, N-CH3 or S then A12 and A13 are both C<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by standard chemical manipulations. In general, compounds according to general formula 1 can be considered to consist of three component parts:<br>
•	Component C1 corresponding to G1<br>
•	Component C2 corresponding to the substituted benzoyl unit<br>
•	Component C3 corresponding to the saturated heterocycle<br><br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Intermediates corresponding to these components are prepared and then assembled to give the final product.   These three components are:<br><br>
for C1, a secondary amine(Figure Removed)<br>
It will be recognised that the substituted benzoic acid that serves for C2 has two functional groups, one of which will need temporary protection during the assembly of the final compound. The principles of functional group protection are well known in the art and are described in, for example, J.F.W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, 1973; T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 2nd edition, John Wiley, 1991; and P.J. Kocienski, "Protecting groups", Georg Thieme Verlag, 1994. The carboxylic acid group will usually be protected as an ester, such as the methyl, benzyl or tert-butyl ester. The primary amine of the benzoic acid (when X1 = NH) will usually be protected as a carbamate derivative such as the terf-butyl carbamate (BOC derivative), the benzyl carbamate (CBZ or more simply Z derivative) or the 9-fluorenylmethyl carbamate (Fmoc derivative). When X1 = O the resulting alcohol function will usually be protected as an ester such as an acetate, or an ether such as a methoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl or trialkylsilyl ether. Other functional groups may require protection. For example, the group G1 may include one or more primary or secondary amino groups which may need protection. In the following general description of the synthetic methodology it will be assumed that such protection is used when necessary.<br>
(i) Preparation of secondary amine for C1<br>
Acyclic secondary amines corresponding to HNRSR5 are well known.   Many are items of commerce.   Those that are not may be prepared according to published methods or by simple modification of such methods.   Some particularly useful methods are listed below, a)  Alkylation <br>
(This method is only applicable in cases where further alkylation can be avoided.)<br>
b)   Reductive amination<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>

With the three components, suitably protected if necessary, in hand, the assembly of the final compound requires the formation of two bonds: between C1 and C2, and between C2 and C3. These bond-forming steps may be taken in either order. Thus, the following sequences can be proposed:<br>
C1 + C2 -» C1C2 -&gt; C1C2C3 C2 + C3 -» C2C3 -» C1C2C3<br>
(i) Formation of Cf-C2 bond<br>
The bond between C1 and C2 is a simple amide bond. The chemistry for making such bonds from a carboxylic acid and a secondary amine is well known in the art of organic synthesis, and particularly in the field of peptide synthesis. The carboxylic acid may be converted into a more reactive species such as an acid chloride (using, for example oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride) or a mixed anhydride (using isobutyl chloroformate). This reactive species is then added to the secondary amine in a suitable solvent, generally an aprotic solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide, in the<br><br>
presence of a base such as triethylamine or 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and the reaction is allowed to proceed at a temperature between -20°C and the boiling point of the solvent. The choice of temperature and the time allowed for the reaction will depend on the reactivity of the two components.<br>
Alternatively, the carboxylic acid and the secondary amine may be mixed in a suitable solvent as above, optionally in the presence of a base, and a condensing agent added. Suitable condensing agents include carbodiimides, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-ethyl-N'-dimethylaminopropylcarbodiimide (EDC, also WSCD for water-soluble carbodiimide), phosphorus reagents such as (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP®) and bromotripyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP®), and ureas such as O-(benzotriazoM-yl)-. N,N,N',N'-tetramethyIuronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU).<br>
(/'/'} Formation of C^C3 bond<br>
The bond between C2 and C3 is a carbamate (when X1 = O) or a urea (when X1 = NH). The first step in the formation of this bond is generally to react the heterocycle derivative with phosgene or a phosgene equivalent such as trichloromethyl chloroformate, bis(trichloromethyl)carbonate or carbonyldiimidazole. Again, an aprotic solvent and a tertiary amine base will generally be used. The intermediate formed in this step is usually not isolated. The alcohol (X1 = O) or amine (X1 = NH) is added and the reaction is allowed to continue, directly forming the carbamate or urea. As an alternative, when X1 = NH the reactive intermediate may be formed by the reaction of C2 with the phosgene equivalent and the amine added in the second part of the synthesis.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are useful in human and animal therapy. When so used, they will generally be formulated in an appropriate manner. Thus a second aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation that includes a compound as described above as an active ingredient. A third aspect of the present invention is the use of a compound according to the first aspect in the manufacture of such a composition.<br><br>
The composition according to the present invention may be presented in any form that is known in the art. For example, the formulation may be presented as a tablet, capsule, powder, suppository, cream, solution or suspension, or in a more complex form such as an adhesive patch. The formulation will generally include one or more excipients, such as diluents, bulking agents, binding agents, dispersants, solvents, preservatives, flavoring agents and the like. Where the formulation is presented as a tablet or capsule the excipients may optionally include one or more agents to control the release of the active species, such as a coating of a polymer that is insoluble at low pH but soluble at neutral or high pH. Such a coating (known as an "enteric coating") prevents the release of the active agent in the stomach but allows its release in the intestines. The formulation may also include one or more additional pharmacologically active species. Preferably the formulation includes no such additional active agents.<br>
In further aspects, the present invention comprises the use of such compositions, and hence of the compounds of the invention, in human and animal therapy, and methods of treatment involving such use of the compositions and compounds. The compounds of the present invention are potent and selective oxytocin receptor agonists, and so the compositions are useful in the treatment of conditions for which inadequate oxytocin-like activity is implicated in the pathophysiology. Such conditions include, but are not limited to: sexual disorders such as male erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and female sexual dysfunction, cancer of the prostate, breast, ovary and bones, osteoporosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, post-partum bleeding, and depression. The compositions may<br>
*<br>
also be used to induce labour or delivery of the placenta, to decrease arterial blood pressure, to decrease exaggerated responses to stress and to increase the nociceptive threshold.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition is used to treat male or female sexual dysfunction, and more preferably erectile dysfunction.<br>
When used as therapeutic agents, the compositions of the present invention may be administered by any appropriate route that is known in the art. For example, they may be administered by the oral, buccal, sublingual, rectal, intravaginal, nasal, pulmonary or transdermal routes. Alternatively, they may be given by injection, including intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. The amount given will be determined by the attending physician taking into consideration all appropriate factors. Generally a single<br><br>
dose will comprise between 0.1 mg and 1000mg, preferably between 1mg and 250mg, of active compound. The dose may be given on a single occasion or repeatedly. When given repeatedly, it may be given at regular intervals, such as once, twice or three times daily, or on demand, according to the condition .being treated.<br>
For long-term treatment an alternative to repeated dosing may be the administration of a depot dose. For this method of administration the active agent is generally introduced into a matrix of biodegradable polymer, such as a copolymer of lactic and glycolic acids, and the formulation is given either s.c. or i.m. so as to form a deposit from which the active agent is released as the polymer degrades.<br>
