				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a permanent split type mandrel of variety of shapes and<br>
dimensions for repeated use in fabrication/production of helically wound composite pipes<br>
of corresponding varieties of shapes and dimensions. In particular, the permanent split<br>
type mandrel of the present invention is specifically advantageous for carrying out<br>
repeated fabrication of pipes involving winding of resin impregnated fibre rovings in<br>
manufacturing fibre-reinforced composite pipes/shells having precise winding at a<br>
predetermined angle and spacing on the surface of such mandrel and also favor easy<br>
detachability of the finished pipe/shell from said split type mandrel. This would enable a<br>
faster, simpler and cost effective manner of improving productivity and ensuring consistent<br>
accuracy and good quality of helically wound composite pipes.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the expanding globally competitive environment and application of newer<br>
technologies, prerequisites like the ability to reduce production cycle time, improve<br>
productivity and minimize cost are the essential elements to sustain the fierce competition<br>
faced in terms of quantity/volume associated with uncompromising quality of product.<br>
Synthetic fibers, plastics and composites are materials finding place to newer applications,<br>
substituting traditional materials. Composite pipes/shells are in great demand in industries<br>
like the defence, agriculture, aviation and space research. The typical fabrication<br>
procedure of such pipes involves precise winding of resin impregnated composite roving at<br>
a predetermined angle and spacing on the surface of a mandrel, followed by curing.<br>
Conventionally, once cured the cast/wound pipe is either taken out of the mandrel in a<br>
tedious way applying requisite force for detachment: with suitable means/apparatus or by<br>
collapsing the mandrel permanently.<br>
It is known in the related art, that there are normally two types of mandrels in use for<br>
fabrication of composite pipes. These are (i) collapsible mandrel made of some fragile<br>
materials like fly ash, sand, paper etc. and (ii) single piece metallic permanent type<br>
mandrel having a definite taper on the outer surface of the mandrel.<br>
Both the above types of mandrels are capable of winding resin impregnated roving on it<br>
and curing the wound layers of composite roving. It is, however, experienced in the art<br>
that the removal of the cast pipe from these existing conventional configuration of<br>
 <br>
mandrels are either expensive and tedious or involve complex gadget for dislodging the<br>
cast component from the mandrel with possibility of inducing error/defects in the product.<br>
In some cases such as the collapsible mandrels after the pipe is cast and curec, the<br>
collapsible mandrel has to be broken/dissolved for removal of the finished product. This is<br>
done either manually or subjecting the finished product wound over the mandrel to a highspeed<br>
 water jet such that the mandrel collapses releasing the final product safely without<br>
any damage. Thus it is apparent that the conventional configuration of mandrels has single<br>
product life and for each casting a new core/mandrel is required to be built and used. This<br>
makes the entire process of production of composite wound pipes very expensive, time<br>
consuming with low productivity.<br>
The other type of mandrel used conventionally in the related industry, is made of metal<br>
and is of permanent type having fixed near cylindrical shape and geometry. The removal<br>
of finished product is accomplished by employing a hydraulic extractor type additional<br>
fixture. During removal, the mandrel containing the finished product is unloaded from the<br>
centers of winding machine and is mounted on this additional fixture for applying a high<br>
axial force. To facilitate removal of cast/wound pipe from the mandrel is often provided<br>
with a taper. In spite of presence of the taper, the axial force required to dismantle the<br>
pipe from the permanent metal mandrel remain substantially high. The application of force<br>
required for detaching the part from the mandrel often inflicts damage on the surface/edge<br>
of the cast product, especially at the ends. Because of the high axial force, the end is<br>
bulged visibly and distribution of roving tends to be non-uniform. Moreover, the amount, of<br>
axial force, which is proportional to the length of the pipe, often induces zones of high<br>
stress concentration in the cast product leading to the formation of micro-cracks in it.<br>
Under the action of such accumulation of stress, the quality of the composite pipe may<br>
further deteriorate in case of low wall thickness. The conventional configurations of<br>
mandrel for winding of fibre impregnated roving system thus suffer from the following<br>
distinct disadvantages and limitations, needing appropriate remedy:<br>
a.	Use of collapsible mandrel is expensive and time consuming affecting productivity<br>
adversely.<br>
b.	The force required to remove the existing configuration of permanent mandrel<br>
being directly proportional to the length of the cast pipe.<br>
c.	High axial force, required to remove the product from permanent mandrel inflicts<br>
damage by way of formation of end bulge and, creating regions of stress<br>
concentration leading to formation of micro cracks.<br>
 <br>
d.	An additional hydraulic/mechanical type fixture is required for applying axial force<br>
for removal of cast part from the conventional permanent metal mandrel.<br>
e.	The external surface of existing metallic mandrel, provided with slight taper to<br>
facilitate easy dismantling of cast and cured pipe, incorporate unwanted taper in<br>
the internal surface of the cast pipe.<br>
f.	Maintenance cost for the total system is comparatively high due to frequent wear<br>
and tear and/or replacement and related downtime to attend to address the same.<br>
There has, therefore, been a persistent need in the related art to tide over the limitations<br>
of the conventional process of winding fiber impregnated composite roving for formation of<br>
pipe using either consumable or fixed type mandrel in a safe and effortless manner to<br>
comply with requirements of configuration and quality- standard demanded by different<br>
industry segments. A special split type reconfigurable permanent mandrel configuration<br>
has been conceived and implemented by way of the present invention in the field of<br>
fabricating such composite pipes of varied shape and dimensions, such that the said split<br>
type mandrel can be split into a number of parts and thus facilitating removal of the cast<br>
and cured composite pipe from the said mandrel without needing excess of axial force for<br>
detachment or inflicting any damage or unwanted stress concentration of the composite<br>
cast part, at the time of unloading. Importantly, permanent split type configuration of the<br>
mandrel would on one hand favor faster removal of product after winding/casting of the<br>
composite pipe and on the other hand improve productivity by faster recycling by<br>
assembly and reuse of the said permanent type mandrel.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a permanent split type<br>
mandrel comprising a plurality of detachable components such as to favor easy removal of<br>
the cast/wound and cured composite pipe after curing, in a easy and faster manner<br>
without the application of any axial force, so that the same mandrel can be reassembled<br>
for reuse to cast a next pipe in sequence at lesser cycle time/set-up time and thereby<br>
favoring improved product quality, accuracy and productivity.<br>
A further object of the present invention is directed to eliminating any end bulging or crack<br>
formation of cast composite pipe due to stress concentration during removal of the cast<br>
 <br>
and cured part/pipe by using the permanent split type reusable metal mandrel according<br>
to the invention.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to permanent split type mandrel<br>
configuration for fabrication of resin impregnated roving wound composite pipe directed to<br>
eliminate use of any additional fixture to apply axial force to remove the cast/wound and<br>
cured pipe from the said split type permanent mandrel.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to a permanent split type mandrel<br>
configuration for fabrication of resin impregnated roving wound composite pipe, so that<br>
the same is reused at less set up time thus eliminating the need for single-use consumable<br>
mandrel needing longer cycle/changeover time for cast/wound pipe fabrication in<br>
batch/sequence.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to a permanent split type mandrel<br>
configuration for fabrication of resin impregnated roving wound composite pipe wherein<br>
the wear and tear of individual split components are minimized by eliminating application<br>
of any axial force and thus needing less maintenance and related cost, ensuring longer<br>
reliable performance.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to a permanent split type mandrel<br>
configuration for fabrication of resin impregnated roving wound composite pipe wherein<br>
the dismantling force required is radial in nature and of small magnitude and is thus<br>
independent of the length of the cast part/pipe.<br>
A still further object of the present invention directed to a permanent split type mandrel<br>
configuration for fabrication of resin impregnated roving wound composite pipe wherein<br>
the accuracy of split components, individually as well as in combination when assembled,<br>
ensure higher dimensional accuracy and surface finish at the inside of the wound/cast and<br>
cured pipe, which is attainable even with very small wall thickness of pipe ensuring its safe<br>
removal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTON OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE<br>
ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
The present invention is directed to a permanent split type metal mandrel comprising a<br>
plurality of components assembled together to generate desired variety of shapes and<br>
dimensions of the mandrel to favor winding of impregnated roving in a pre-selected<br>
manner on its surface for fabrication of composite pipes of desired shape, dimensions and<br>
accuracy. The split type permanent mandrel configuration of the present invention is<br>
adapted to simple, accurate and fast assembly and dismantling and thus favoring its<br>
multiple use for faster production and reliable quality in a safe mode of dismantling of the<br>
cast and cured composite pipe from said mandrel.<br>
Reference is first invited to the accompanying Figure 1 that illustrates an exploded<br>
perspective view of the permanent split type metallic mandrel in dismantled condition<br>
wherein said split type configuration according to the present invention is found to<br>
comprise a plurality of components of various shapes and sizes, in a match making<br>
relational position. The mandrel shown comprises four channels-two narrower channels<br>
(2,11) and two wider channels (8,12), are brought together in such a way that similar<br>
channels face each other when assembled. The wider (8,12) and the narrower (2,11)<br>
channels having the outer surfaces forming part of the cyl ndrical surface of the mandrel in<br>
assembly and are having appropriate slot in each of such channels to accommodate<br>
spigots for assembly. Four dowel pins (6) are used to locate the relative alignment of<br>
different channels in the mandrel assembly. To provide further rigidity to the assembled<br>
mandrel, bolts (5) and nuts (7) are used. Two flanged hubs (9,13) are then mounted on<br>
 <br>
both sides of the mandrel assembly. The flanged hubs are located through respective<br>
spigot and screwed at both the ends of the mandrel assembly. Two annular rings (3,10)<br>
are then mounted on the mandrel assembly and clamped at the desired location/position<br>
through collar fixing screw (1). The mandrel is designed so that after winding of roving<br>
and curing, the fabricated composite pipe is extracted eas ly from the permanent split type<br>
mandrel. The extraction process can be accomplished very easily by splitting the mandrel<br>
into four parts. The splitting process is performed by unlocking the fasteners and applying<br>
minor radial force. Once the pipe is taken out, the mandrel can be reassembled for further<br>
work.<br>
Reference is now invited to the accompanying Figure 2 that illustrates the perspective<br>
view of the permanent split type mandrel according to the invention, in assembled<br>
position. Narrow (2,11) and wide (8,12) channels are assembled in a manner so that the<br>
outer surface of the channels form a strictly cylindrical surface of the mandrel assembly.<br>
The channels are furnished with proper fittings in such a way that they can be assembled<br>
or dismantled very quickly and accurately. Special machining steps are taken in such a<br>
way that any manufacturing inaccuracy will not prevail and all the parts are bound to be<br>
assembled accurately. The matching of the split parts are so accurate that even excess<br>
resin from the impregnated roving will not be able to sip through the junction of two<br>
adjacent pieces. As already described in preceding para, four numbers dowel pins (6) are<br>
used to maintain relative alignment of the different in the mandrel assembly and that the<br>
Bolts (5) and nuts (7) are used to hold the channels firmly together. Two numbers annular<br>
rings (3,10) that snugly fit on the mandrel assembly to provide additional support to the<br>
mandrel assembly from outside. Collar fixing screws (1) are used for fixing the annular<br>
rings with mandrel assembly. Flanged hubs (9,13) with spigot are used for identifying the<br>
axis of the mandrel assembly and at the same time provide the facility for mounting of the<br>
mandrel assembly on the winding machine. Six pairs of screws (4) are used that pass<br>
through the flanged hubs (9,13) with spigot to fasten them with the<br>
channels. According to an important aspect of the invention of the permanent split type<br>
mandrel for fabrication of wound/cast composite pipe, the split sections are able to move<br>
relatively in the radial directions, the cast product is removed easily by applying radial<br>
forces on the component parts. The dismantling force being radial in nature, the<br>
magnitude of same need not to be high and is independent of the length of the product.<br>
Because of this special feature, casting and removal of thin or very thin composite pipes<br>
are accomplished accurately with reliable and consistent quality. Moreover, such a simple<br>
and effortless removal process of mandrel from cast and cured pipe virtually eliminates<br>
 <br>
chances of formation of highly stressed region and thereby any induced tendency of crack<br>
formation of the final part produced.<br>
As already described the permanent split configuration of the reconfigurable mandrel is<br>
adapted to faster assembly and dismantling favoring accuracy and quality of wound<br>
composite pipe avoiding any damage/distortion and also ensuring reliable operation and<br>
higher productivity. Accompanying Figure 3 shows how the assembled permanent split<br>
type mandrel is mounted on the winding machine for fabrication of the composite pipe by<br>
winding the roving of impregnated fiber over the mandrel in a desired manner. After<br>
winding of roving in pre-determined pattern to form the pipe over cylindrical surface of<br>
mandrel, it is cured in room temperature and then it is necessary to remove the pipe from<br>
the mandrel. The mandrel is so designed that this extraction process can be accomplished<br>
very easily by splitting it into four parts. For dismantling the mandrel assembly, the<br>
assembly steps should be followed in reverse sequence to release the individual<br>
components in sequence. The splitting process is performed by unlocking the fasteners<br>
and applying minor radial force. Once the pipe is taken out, the mandrel can be<br>
reassembled for further work.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to develop a permanent split type<br>
metallic mandrel, adapted to be assembled and dismantled in a simple and faster manner<br>
such that the composite pipe produced by winding of impregnated roving over the said<br>
split type reusable mandrel, without requirement of any application of axial force of large<br>
magnitude using any special hydraulic/mechanical fixture or device. The permanent split<br>
type mandrel is having highly accurate configuration such that the pipe fabricated using<br>
the mandrel is on one hand provide consistent good quali:y with high level of dimensional<br>
accuracy, avoiding any damage caused due to axial force application and resultant end<br>
bulging, or crack initiation due to stress concentration in the finished pipe produced and on<br>
the other hand ensure faster dismantling and reassembly for reuse of said mandrel,<br>
improving the productivity and thus having prospect of wide industrial application in a<br>
variety of industries in the related field.<br>

clamping means adapted to maintain the split assembled parts firmly together which in<br>
case of a cylindrical shaped mandrel preferably comprise two annular rings mounted on<br>
the mandrel assembly and clamped at the desired position through collar fixing screws.<br>
10.	A permanent mandrel as claimed in anyone of claims 1 to 9 wherein the said flanged<br>
hubs with spigot is adapted for identifying the axis of the mandrel assembly and also<br>
facilitate the fixing of the mandrel assembly on the winding machine.<br>
<br>
A permanent split type mandrel of variety of shape and dimensions for repetitive use in<br>
fabrication/production of helically wound composite pipes of corresponding shapes and<br>
dimensions. In particular, the permanent split type mandrel of the present invention is<br>
advantageously applied for fabrication procedure involving winding of resin impregnated<br>
fibre rovings in manufacturing fibre-reinforced composite pipes/shells having precise<br>
winding at a predetermined angle and spacing on the surface of such mandrel so as to<br>
favor easy assembling for such fabrication and detachability of the finished pipe/shell from<br>
said split type mandrel with application of minimal force in radial direction, in a faster,<br>
simpler and cost effective manner, and thus improving productivity and ensuring<br>
consistent accuracy and good quality of the part produced.</td>
