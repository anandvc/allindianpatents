				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESSING CELL OF AUTOMATIC MACHINING SYSTEM<br>
AND AUTOMATIC HONING SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a processing cell of an automatic machining system, and an automatic honing system, and more particularly to an automatic machining technology such as automatic honing process for conveying, for example, works provided with prepared holes sequentially along a work conveying route at specific intervals, and machining holes sequentially and continuously in the works by means of a boring machine and a honing machine installed within the work conveying route.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Honing is known, for example, as one of machining methods for finishing the inner circumference of works precisely. In honing process, a honing tool and a work are set in a relatively floating state, and rotary and reciprocal motions are given to the honing tool, and the inner circumference of the work is finished precisely while expanding the wheel of the honing tool by a wedge or cone.<br>
Recently, as an apparatus for efficiently honing the inner circumference of works as mass production pieces such as the<br><br>
inner circumference of automotive parts, an automatic honing system has been developed for honing the works conveyed at specific intervals sequentially and continuously by means of plural honing machines arrayed in a line.<br>
An example of such automatic honing system is shown in Fig. 3 0, in which a work conveying route a is formed in a loop, and a work loading b, a work machining section c, and a work unloading d are arrayed in this work conveying route a.-<br>
At the work loading b, works W supplied in line by a work feeder e such as parts feeder are mounted on a honing jig g waiting at a detaching position P of the work conveying route a by means of a robot device f. The honing jig g holding the work W is sent to a position of a prepared hole detecting device i by means of a delivery device h, and the inside diameter of the prepared hole of the work W is detected by the prepared hole detecting device i.<br>
In succession, while holding the work W, the honing jig g is sent to the work machining section c, in which the work W is conveying in a cycle sequentially comprising a rough honing machine k, a first detecting device 1, an intermediate honing machine m, a second detecting device n, a finish honing machine o, and a third detecting device p, by means of a transfer device j, and is positioned at each machine position, so that the specified honing process is executed sequentially and automatically.<br><br>
The work W completely finished in the work machining section c is cleaned by a brush device q, and is sent out to the detaching position P by means of a discharge device r, a return device s, and a pushing device t in the work unloading d, and is sorted according to the result of measurement by the third detecting device p by the robot device f at the work loading b again, and a conforming work is put into a conforming piece chute u, and a defective piece is put into a reject chute v.<br>
This automatic honing system is designed as a tailored machine for specific works W depending on the shape, dimensions and machining conditions of the works, and all sections a, b, c, d are integrally fixed on a large machine frame (not shown) , and are driven by a control device x which controls the entire system in batch.<br>
In such system configuration designed as a tailored machine for specific works W, the following problems were known.<br>
(1) The number of process of honing is determined by the accuracy of the shape of prepared holes of the works W, stock removal, and required shape accuracy, but the accuracy of shape of prepared holes and stock removal are not stable in the stage of trial production.<br>
Accordingly, in the configuration in which all sections a, b, c, d are integrally fixed on a large machine frame, and the entire system is controlled by one control device x in batch, the number of process cannot be determined until reaching the<br><br>
final stage.<br>
(2)	By the same reason, if the prepared hole accuracy of the works W is changed or if the required machining accuracy of the works W is changed, the number of process cannot be changed.<br>
(3)	Also by the same reason, it is hard to determine the capital investment if prediction of the production quantity of works W is difficult.<br>
(4)	Since this is a tailored machine designed for specific works W, when production of the specific works W is stopped, the mechanical configuration of the entire system must be modified in order to use for machining of other works differing in shape, dimension and machining conditions, or if such modification is impossible, the entire system must be discarded, and the apparatus cost is very high.<br>
(5)	Since the sections a, b, c, d are composed as one<br>
integral apparatus, hydraulic units as drive sources for<br>
i ndividual devices, coolant tanks used in machining, and others<br>
shared among individual constituent devices are large in size<br>
and installed separately, and the entire system is large and<br>
complicated, and the apparatus cost is soaring.<br>
Most of these problems are not limited to this automatic honing system, but were common among automatic machining systems for machining machine parts and other mass production pieces sequentially and continuously by using plural machine<br><br>
tools arrayed in a line.<br>
The invention is devised in the light of the problems of such prior art, and it is hence an object thereof to present a processing cell of an automatic machining system having a small, lightweight and simple structure, capable of determining or changing the number of process easily, easy in design, and lowered in the apparatus cost.<br>
It is other object of the invention to present a structure of an automatic honing system comprising a plurality of such processing cells.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the objects, the processing cell of the invention composing a machining section of an automatic machining system for conveying the works along the work conveying route continuously at specific intervals, and machining the works sequentially and continuously, and has a unit structure comprising at least a conveying device for composing a part of the work conveying route, a single machine tool, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling, and is designed to be installed in the machining section of the automatic machining system so as to be freely increased or decreased in number.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the conveying device comprises at least a conveying rail for mounting and guiding a processing<br><br>
jig for accommodating and holding works, work moving means for sending the processing jig mounted on the conveying rail to a specified position in cycle operation, and positioning means for positioning the processing jig sent by the work moving means in cycle operation at the specified position. The conveying device further comprises a return rail for mounting and guiding the processing jig for accommodating and holding the works finished in the processing step, and work returning means for returning and moving the processing jig mounted on the return rail.<br>
At least the conveying rails or the return rails of the conveying device are arrayed and positioned so as to form a part of the straight portion of the work conveying route, and the machining sections of the automatic machining system are designed to be increased or decreased in number or reshuffled in combination. The conveying device is desired to be configured so as to invert the work flowing direction normally and reversely.<br>
The automatic honing system of the invention is an automatic honing system for honing the works conveyed along the work conveying route at specific intervals sequentially and continuously, by using plural honing machines disposed within the work conveying route for conveying the works, in which the honing section for honing the works is composed of boring cells for boring the prepared holes of works, and honing cells for<br><br>
honing the works so as to be freely increased or decreased in number, and these plural processing cells are mutually linked, driven and controlled, and the boring cell has a unit structure comprising at least a conveying device for composing a part of the work conveying route, a single boring machine, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling, and the honing cell has a unit structure comprising at least a conveying device for composing a part of the work conveying route, a single honing machine, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the loading cell for composing the work delivery section, plural processing cells, and the unloading cell for composing the work discharge section are arrayed and disposed in a line, the work conveying route is formed in a loop, or the loading cell for composing the work delivery section, plural processing cells, and the unloading cell for composing the work discharge section are arrayed and disposed in a line, the work conveying route is formed in a straight line.<br>
It further comprises a honing jig for holding the work, being conveyed in the work conveying route, and this honing jig comprises a j ig base movably placed on the work conveying route, an oscillator disposed on the jig base oscillatably in three dimensions, and a work holder attached to this oscillator. By contrast, the conveying device of the boring cell comprises<br><br>
locking means for fixing and supporting the work holder of the honing jig positioned at the boring position of the conveying rail.<br>
Further, at least the conveying rails or return rails of the conveying device in the processing cells are arrayed and positioned so as to form a part of the straight portion of the work conveying route, so that the honing sections of the automatic honing system are combined and formed. The conveying device is preferred to be configured so as to invert the work flow direction normally and reversely.<br>
In the automatic machining system comprising the processing cells of the invention, for example, in the automatic honing system, specified honing process is executed automatically and continuously in the following sequence by means of a control device.<br>
For instance, at the work delivery position of the work conveying route formed in a loop, by the work delivery unit composed of the loading cell, the work is automatically set on the honing jig on the work conveying route. As a result, the work is held oscillatably in three dimensions by the floating structure of the honing jig.<br>
The honing jig holding the work having a prepared hole is conveyed on the work conveying route, and is automatically conveyed and positioned at the processing position of the honing section composed of plural processing cells, and a specified<br><br>
hole is drilled by the boring machine and honing machine of each processing cell (that is, boring by the boring machine and honing by the honing machine), and the work processing diameter is measured by the detecting device. This result of measurement is used in judgement of approval of the work, and is fed back to the control unit of the boring machine and honing machine of the processing cell, and next hole processing is controlled.<br>
The honing jig holding the work after processing is discharged from the honing section by the work discharge section composed of unloading cell, and is returned and conveyed to the work delivery position.<br>
Again, by the work delivery section, the work is taken out from the honing jig, and is selected and discharged.<br>
In particular, in the automatic honing system of the invention, the work is bored by the boring machine of the boring cell prior to the honing process by the honing machine of the honing cell, and therefore the hole is processed precisely by a smaller number of process than in the conventional automatic honing system.<br>
That is, the honing process is processing along the shape of: the prepared hole (for example, in a bent state if the prepared hole is bent), that is, the so-called copying process, and therefore the final finish processing accuracy in the conventional automatic honing system depends on the effect of Lhe processing accuracy of the prepared hole.<br><br>
By contrast, in the automatic honing system of the invention, prior to honing process, the boring process is provided for processing the prepared hole by force, and therefore the prepared hole of the work can be i) corrected to increase the stock removal by heat treatment strain or the like, ii) corrected by force regardless of the processing accuracy (roundness, cylindricality, etc.), and iii) corrected of end squareness, concentricity, etc. which could not be corrected by force in the conventional honing process. As a result, the final finishing processing accuracy in the automatic honing system of the invention does not depend on the processing accuracy of the prepared hole, so that a very precise hole processing is realized.<br>
In the automatic honing system, the processing cells are connected and disposed so as to be increased or decreased freely in number, and the structure is small, lightweight and simple, the number of process can be determined or changed easily, the design is easy, and the apparatus cost can be reduced.<br>
That is, the number of process in the honing process is determined by the accuracy of shape of the prepared hole of the work, stock removal, and required shape accuracy, and in the stage of trial production, the accuracy of prepared hole shape and stock removal are not stable, while the processing cells of the invention are designed to be incorporated in the honing section of the automatic honing system by increasing or<br><br>
decreasing in number freely, and therefore if the number of process cannot be determined early, it can be determined effectively later.<br>
By the same reason, if the accuracy of the prepared hole of the work is changed, or if the required processing accuracy of the work is changed, by properly combining the processing cells which can be freely increased or decreased in number, the number of process can be changed promptly and easily.<br>
Also by the same reason, if it is difficult to predict the production amount of works, the capital investment can be determined easily by considering changeover of multiple models or dispersion of processes including the processing cells freely increased or decreased in number.<br>
By the same reason, if the accuracy of the prepared hole of the work is changed, or if the required processing accuracy of the work is changed, by properly combining the processing cells which can be freely increased or decreased in number, the number of process can be changed promptly and easily.<br>
Also by the same reason, if it is difficult to predict the production amount of works, the capital investment can be determined easily by considering changeover of multiple models or dispersion of processes including the processing cells freely increased or decreased in number.<br>
Moreover, since the processing cells are composed in unit structure comprising the conveying device composing a part of<br><br>
the work conveying route, a single honing machine, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling, so as to be freely increased or decreased in number, if production of the specific works designed to be processed is stopped, in order to use for machining of other works differing in shape, dimension and machining conditions, part of the system may be modified or changed, the processing cells can be properly increased or decreased, depending on the shape, dimensions and processing conditions of the works.<br>
Further, since the processing cells are in cell structure, hydraulic units as drive source of the constituent devices, and coolant tanks used in machining, and others can be set independently and reduced in size in each processing cell, and can be mounted on the main body frame of each processing cell, so that the entire system is simplified and reduced in size.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are described below<br>
while referring to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An automatic honing system of the invention is shown in Fig.<br><br>
1, in which the system conveys works W, W, ... along a work conveying route 1 continuously at specific intervals, and hones these works W, W, ... sequentially and continuously.<br>
In this automatic honing system, specifically, delivery cells B and discharge cells C are arrayed in a straight row at both sides of a plurality of (three in this example) processing cells Ax, A2, A3 in unit structure, and the system mainly comprises the work conveying route 1 formed in a loop composed of these processing cells Ai, A2, A3/ B, C, a work feeder 2, a work loading and unloading robot 3, a prepared hole detector 4, a boring machine (accuracy boring machine in this example) 5a, a first detecting device 6a for accuracy boring, a first honing machine 5b for intermediate processing, a second detecting device 6b for intermediate processing, a second honing machine 5c for finishing, and a third detecting device 6c for finishing.<br>
The processing cells A1, A2, A3 compose the honing section of this honing system, and have a same basic mechanical structure to be installed in the honing section to be freely increased or decreased in number, and a specific configuration of the processing cell A1 having the accuracy boring machine 5a is shown in Fig. 2 to Fig. 12, and a specific configuration of the processing cells A2, A3 having the honing machines 5b and 5c is shown in Fig. 13 to Fig. 20. The specific configuration of the processing cell A1    and the processing cells A2, A3 is<br><br>
sequentially explained below.<br>
The processing cell A1 having the accuracy boring machine 5a has a unit structure as shown in Fig. 2 to Fig. 12, comprising a conveying device 10 forming a part of the work conveying route 1, a single accuracy boring machine (machine tool) 5 (5a), a detecting device 6 (6a), and a control unit 7 (7a) for linking them mutually and controlling.<br>
The conveying device 10 is composed of a conveying section<br>
11	for conveying the works W to be processed, and a return section<br>
12	for conveying the works W after processing.<br>
The conveying section 11 includes, as shown in Fig. 4 to Fig. 7, a conveying rail 21, a work moving device (work moving means) 22, and a positioning device (positioning means) 23, and is composed, as shown in Fig. 3, to pass through the lower side position of the accuracy boring machine 5a and detecting device 6a, and is disposed on a conveying section platform 24. The conveying rail 21 and return rail 45 for composing the conveying section 11 function also as the installation reference of the processing cell A1 as mentioned below, and are also designed to invert the flow direction of the works W normally and reversely.<br>
The conveying rail 21 is for mounting and guiding the honing 81g 20 for accommodating and holding the work W, and as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the guide rail is in a straight shape having a guide groove 21a for guiding the honing jig 20,   and at the<br><br>
processing position of the accuracy boring machine 5a and the measuring position of the detecting device 6a, the positioning device 23 for positioning the honing jig 20 is provided respectively. At the processing position of the accuracy boring machine 5a, there is a lock device (locking means} 27 for fixing and supporting the motion of the honing jig 20 positioned by the positioning device 23.<br>
The workmoving device 22 is to feed the honing jig 20 mounted on the conveying rail 21 to the specified position in cycle operation, and specifically it is composed of a cylinder device for pressing and moving the honing jig 20, and in the shown embodiment it is composed of a pair of air cylinder devices 25, 26.<br>
The first air cylinder device 25 comprises a moving table 80 provided reciprocally along the guide groove 21a of the conveying rail 21, and an air cylinder 31 for moving this moving table 30 reciprocally.<br>
The moving table 30 has two sets of a structure for holding the honing jig 20 (jig base holding structure) at front and rear positions at a specific interval, and is designed to array and hold two honing jigs 20. The front and rear jig base holding structures are basically identical, and specifically comprise a pair of engaging pawl mechanisms 36, 37 for engaging with and nolding the front and rear edges of the pallet of the honing jig 20 or jig base 25 from the front and rear sides.<br><br>
The front engaging mechanism 36 is composed of a pair of right and left engaging pawls 36a, 36a having slopes at front and rear sides, and repulsive springs 36b, 36b for pushing these engaging pawls 36a, 36a always upward repulsively. As a result, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 36a, 36a are engaged in a structure for allowing relative move in both front and rear directions of the jig base 35 of the honing jig 20. That is, when the jig base 35 moves relatively in the front and rear directions, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 3 6a, 36a are lowered by resisting the repulsive force of the repulsive springs 36b, 36b by the action of the slopes at both front and rear sides, thereby allowing a relative move of the jig base 35.<br>
The front side engaging mechanism 36 in the both jig base holding structures at the rear side is composed of the engaging pawl 36a and repulsive spring 36b in one of the right and left sides, and the other side is composed of an engaging pawl 36c oscillatable in the vertical direction, and an air cylinder 36d for oscillating this engaging pawl 36c in the vertical direction between the engaging position (upright position shown in Fig. 7} and the disengaging position (prone position not shown) , and this engaging pawl 36c collaborates with the rear side engaging mechanism 37, and functions to position and lock the jig base 35 located at this position.<br>
The rear side engaging mechanism 37 is composed of a pair<br><br>
of right and left engaging pawls 37a, 37a having slopes only at the rear side, and repulsive springs 37b, 37b for pushing these engaging pawls 37a, 37b always upward repulsively. As a result, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 37a, 37a have an engaging structure for allowing relative move only in the front direction of the jig base 35 of the honing jig 20.<br>
That is, when the jig base 35 moves relatively in the front direction, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 37a, 37a are lowered by resisting the repulsive force of the repulsive springs 36b, 36b by the action of the slopes at the rear side, thereby allowing a relative move of the jig base 35, and on the other hand when the jig base 35 moves relatively in the rear direction, since the front sides of the pair of right and left engaging pawls 37a, 37a are vertical planes, they are not lowered by the repulsive force of the repulsive springs 36b, 36b, thereby engaging and blocking the relative move of the jig base 35.<br>
The air cylinder 31 is installed horizontally on the conveying section platform at the lower side position of the conveying rail 21, and its piston rod 31a is connected to the moving table 30 through a joint 38.<br>
The second air cylinder device 26 comprises a moving table 40 provided reciprocally along the guide groove 21a of the conveying rail 21, and an air cylinder 41 for moving the moving table 40 reciprocally, at the lower side of the moving table JO of the first air cylinder device 25.<br><br>
The moving table 40 has an engaging pawl mechanism 42 for engaging with and holding the rear edge of the jig base 35 of the honing jig 20 at its front end position.<br>
The engaging mechanism 42 is composed of a pair of right and left engaging pawls 42a, 42a having slopes only at the rear side, and repulsive springs 42b, 42b for pushing these engaging pawls 42a, 42a always upward repulsively. As a result, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 42a, 42a have a structure for allowing relative move only in the front direction of the jig base 35 of the honing jig 20.<br>
That is, when the jig base 35 moves relatively in the front direction, the pair of right and left engaging pawls 42a, 42a are lowered by resisting the repulsive force of the repulsive springs 42b, 42b by the action of the slopes at the rear side, thereby allowing a relative move of the jig base 35, and on the other hand when the jig base 35 moves relatively in the rear direction, since the front sides of the pair of right and left engaging pawls 42a, 42a are vertical planes, they are not lowered by the repulsive force of the repulsive springs 42b, 42b, thereby engaging and blocking the relative move of the jig base 35.<br>
Corresponding to the engaging pawl mechanism 42 of the moving table 40, an advance recess 30a is opened backward at the rear end of the moving table 30 of the first air cylinder device 25.<br>

The positioning and holding state by the positioning devices 23, 23 is maintained, and the positioning and holding state by the rear side jig base holding structure of the moving table 30 is cleared, and then the piston rods 31a, 41a of the air cylinders 31, 41 retract and operate sequentially.<br>
That is, (3) the air cylinder 31 retracts up to the retract position, and the neutral and rear honing jigs 20a, 20b are positioned and held at the respective positions by the<br><br>
positioning device 23, and only the moving table 30 moves back to the position shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, and the rear side jig base holding structures 36, 37 in the first air cylinder device 25 are engaged with the jig base 35 of the succeeding honing jig 20 waiting at the waiting position Q3, while the front side jig base holding structures 36, 37 are engaged with the jig base 35 of the rear honing jig 20c at the processing position Q2-<br>

As a result, the second oscillating member 231 is oscillatable in three dimensions as the motion of the Y-cross pins 234, 234 (rotation about Y-Y axis) is added to the motion of the X-cross pins 233, 233 (rotation about X-X axis) . Accordingly, as mentioned below, a favorable and uniform following performance to the honing tool 160 is assured, and the processing accuracy error is avoided, and honing of high accuracy is assured.<br>
A work holder 227 is designed to position and hold the work W, and is mounted on the second oscillating member 231 of the oscillating body 226 detachably and rotatably in the horizontal direction, so that it is flexible to cope with changes in shape and size of the works W to be processed.<br>
This work holder 227 is composed as shown in Fig. 26 and Fig. 27, in which a cylindrical work holding part 227b for supporting the work W from the lower side is provided integrally in a raised form in the middle of a disk-shaped holder main body<br><br>

Although not shown specifically, for mounting the work W on the work holder 227, the work W is chucked by the work loading and unloading robot 3, the stopping pins 227c, 227c of the work holder 227 are inserted into the holes in the flange 245 of the work W, the prepared hole 247 is held and supported to the work holding part 227b from the upper side, and in this state the work W is rotated about the axis of the work holding part 227b together with the work holder 227, and the plungers 246, 246 are repulsively stopped, and this state is held. On the other hand, the work W is dismounted from the work holder 227 automatically in the reverse procedure by the work loading and unloading robot 3.<br>
By such three-dimensional oscillation of the oscillating body 226, as mentioned above, the honing jig 20 follows up the work W uniformly and favorably, and assures honing process of<br><br>
high accuracy by the honing tool 160 of the honing machines 5b, 5c, while the work W must be fixed on the boring bar 60 of the accuracy boring machine 5a.<br>
For this purpose, as mentioned above, at the processing position Q2 of the accuracy boring machine 5a, a lock device 27 is provided for fixing the work W on the honing jig 20 positioned by the positioning device 23.<br>
This lock device 27 is for fixing and supporting the oscillating body 226 of the honing jig 20, and in the illustrated embodiment, it is designed to fix and support the second oscillating member 231.<br>
That is, the lock device 27 mainly comprises a jig positioning base 300, a jig lifting device 301, and a jig fixing device 302.<br>
The jig positioning base 300 is for positioning and supporting the second oscillating member 22 6 of the honing jig 20, and is disposed horizontally on the conveying rail 21 of the conveying section 11 by means of four posts 305, 305, ....<br>
In the middle of the jig positioning base 300, there is an insert hole 306 for inserting the boring bar 60 of the accuracy boring machine 5a. At the lower side of the jig positioning base 300, plural (three in this example) positioning reference seats 307, 307, 307 are provided for keeping the horizontal state of the second oscillating member 226, and the upper end of the second oscillating member 226 is held and supported on them.<br><br>
Further, at the lower side of the jig positioning base 300, plural (two in this example) positioning pins 308, 308 are provided oppositely to each other for positioning in the horizontal direction, and corresponding to this configuration, at the upper side of the second oscillating member 226, positioning holes 309, 309 are provided, and by inserting the positioning pins 308, 308 into them, the second oscillating member 226 is positioned in the horizontal direction.<br>
The jig lifting device 301 is for lifting the honing jig 2 0 upward in the vertical direction, and is provided between the conveying rails 21, 21 of the conveying section 11. This jig lifting device 301 is mainly composed of push-up table 310 and a push-up cylinder 311.<br>
The push-up table 310 is installed and supported in horizontal state at the upper end of an elevating rod 312 movably supported in the vertical direction on the conveying section platform 24 between the conveying rails 21, 21. The push-up table 310 is formed like a disk, and three push-up members 313, 313, 313 are provided on the upper surface, and stopping pins 313a, 313a, 313a at their leading ends are inserted into the engaging holes (not shown) provided in the bottom of the second oscillating member 231.<br>

on the conveying section platform 24.<br>
The push-up members 313, 313, 313 of the push-up table 310, and the positioning pins 308, 308 of the jig positioning base 300 are configured so that the horizontal positions may correspond to each other, and therefore the second oscillating member 226 engaged and supported by the push-up members 313, 313, 313 of the push-up table 310 is positioned so that the positioning holes 309, 309 may directly correspond to the positioning pins 308, 308.<br>
The jig fixing device 302 is for pressing and fixing the second oscillating member 231 which is lifted by the j ig lifting device 301 and fixed and supported on the jig positioning base 300, sideways in the horizontal direction, and it is mainly composed of an air cylinder 320. The air cylinder 320 is mounted and supported on one conveying rail 21 by means of a mounting bracket 321, and a pressure pad 322 is fitted to the leading end of its piston rod 320a.<br>
The honing jig 20 thus sent to the processing position Q2 of the processing cell A1 is first positioned by the positioning device 23 (positioning cylinder 23b, positioning plunger 23c) , and the second oscillating member 231 is lifted upward in the vertical direction by the push-up table 310 of the jig lifting device 301, and is fixed and supported on the jig positioning base 300. In this state, the work W held by the second oscillating member 231, that is, by the work holder 227 is<br><br>
positioned and fixed in the horizontal direction while its horizontal state is maintained, and other parts of the honing jig 20, that is, the first oscillating member 230 and jig base 35 suspended and supported on the second oscillating member 231.<br>
Further, the piston rod 320a of the air cylinder 320 of the jig fixing device 302 projects, and the second oscillating member 231 is pressed and fixed sideways in the horizontal direction by the pressure pad 322, so that the work W is positioned and fixed precisely on the boring bar 60 of the accuracy boring machine 5a.<br>
The honing process by using the automatic honing system having such configuration is explained below.<br>
I.	Delivery of works W<br>
Works W, W, ... are conveyed sequentially and continuously to the receiving position while the position is being adjusted, by means of the work feeder 2, and chucked one by one by the work loading and unloading robot 3, and mounted on the work holder 227 of the honing jig 20 waiting at the work delivery position P1 of the work conveying route 1. As a result, the work W is held oscillatably in three dimensions by the floating structure of the honing jig 20.<br>
II.	Automatic honing of works W<br>
i) When the mounting step of the works W on the honing jig 20 at the work delivery position P1 is completed, the deliver device 217 is put in action, and this honing jig 20 (or the work<br><br>
W hereinafter) is conveyed to the loading P2 of the honing processing section, that is, the detecting position of the prepared hole detecting device 4, and after being positioned by the positioning device 23, the prepared hole detecting device 4 detects the inside diameter of the prepared hole of the processing hole 92 of the work W according to the specified procedure, and the result of detection is sent to the control units 7 (7a, 7b, 7c) of the accuracy boring machine 5a and honing machines 5b, 5c.<br>
ii) In this case, as prior step of honing, the processing hole 92 is processed by the accuracy boring machine 5a so that the inside diameter of the prepared hole may settle within a specified honing range, and at the same time by heat treatment or straightening, the stock removal may be increased or the end face squareness or concentricity may be corrected, and then honing is executed by the honing machines 5b, 5c.<br>
That is, the work W positioned at the loading P1 is sequentially conveyed in cycle operation by means of the conveying section 11 of the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3) in the sequence of the accuracy boring machine 5a, first detecting device 6a for boring, second honing machine 5b for intermediate processing, second detecting' device 6b for intermediate processing, third honing machine 5c for finishing, and third detecting device 6c for finishing, and is positioned by the positioning device 23 at each position of the device (at the<br><br>
processing position Q1 of the accuracy boring machine 5a, further by the lock device 27, oscillation of the work holder 227 is locked and stopped), and the specified process is executed sequentially (accuracy boring machine 5a of processing cell A1, honing by honing machines 5b, 5c of processing cells A2, A3, and measurement of work processing diameter by the detecting devices 6a, 6b, 6c), and the result of measurement of the processing hole 92 of the work W by the detecting device 6c for finishing (final finish dimension) is fed back to the second honing machine 5c, and the approval or rejection signal of the work W is sent to the work sorting device 331.<br>
III. Discharge of works W<br>
The work W discharged to the discharge position P3 after a series of honing steps is sent to the return position P4 by the discharge device 225, and send back to the work delivery position P1 by the return section 12 of the processing cells A. (A1, A2/ A3) , and is chucked by the work loading and unloading robot 3, and is dismounted from the work holder 227 of the honing jig 20 in the specified procedure, and is sorted according to the result of sorting by the work sorting device 331, and is discharged into the discharge chute 332.<br>
On the other hand, the honing jig 20 from which the work W is removed waits at the work delivery position 1 until the next work W is mounted by the work loading and unloading robot 3.<br><br>
In the automatic honing system thus composed, prior to honing by the honing machines 5b, 5c, the work W is drilled by the boring machine 5a, and therefore the hole is processed more precisely than in the conventional automatic honing system.<br>
That is, since the honing process is a so-called copying process of processing according to the shape of the prepared hole of the work W (for example, if the prepared hole is bent, a bent hole is processed), in the conventional honing system, the final finish accuracy depends greatly on the processing accuracy of the prepared hole.<br>
By contrast, in this automatic honing system, prior to honing, the prepared hole is processed by force by the accuracy boring machine 5a. Accordingly, the prepared hole of the work W is enhanced in accuracy by 1) correction to increase the stock removal by heat treatment or straightening, 2) forced correction regardless of processing accuracy (roundness, cylindricality, etc.), and 3) correction of end face squareness or concentricity that could not be corrected in the conventional honing process. As a result, the final finish accuracy in this automatic honing system is free from effects of the processing accuracy of the prepared hole of the work W, so that hole processing of higher accuracy can be done in a smaller number of process.<br>
Besides, in the automatic honing system, the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3) are connected and arranged so as to be freely<br><br>
increased or decreased in number to compose the honing section, and therefore the structure is small, lightweight and simple, and the number of process can be determined or changed easily, the design is free, and the apparatus cost can be saved.<br>
That is, the number of process of honing process is determined depending on the shape and accuracy of prepared hole of the work, stock removal, and required shape and accuracy, and hence the accuracy of the prepared hole shape and stock removal are not stable in the trial production stage, but since the number of processing cells A {A1, A2, A3) for composing the honing section of the automatic honing section can be freely increased or decreased, if the number of process cannot be determined in an early stage, it can be freely changed later.<br>
By the same reason, if the accuracy of the prepared hole of the work is changed, or if the required processing accuracy of the work is changed, by properly combining the processing cells A {A1, A2, A3) which can be freely increased or decreased m number, the number of process can be changed promptly and easily.<br>
Also by the same reason, if it is difficult to predict the production amount of works W, the capital investment can be determined easily by considering changeover of multiple models or dispersion of processes including the processing cells A freely increased or decreased in number.<br>
Moreover, since the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3) are<br><br>
composed in unit structure comprising the conveying device 10 composing a part of the work conveying route 1, a single honing machine (accuracy boring machine 5a, honing machines 5b, 5c), and a control unit 7 (7a, 7b, 7c) for linking them mutually and controlling, so as to be freely increased or decreased in number, if production of the specific works W designed to be processed is stopped, in order to use for machining of other works W differing in shape, dimension and machining conditions, part of the system may be modified or changed, the processing cells A can be properly increased or decreased, depending on the shape, dimensions and processing conditions of the works W.<br>
Further, since the processing cells A (Ax, A2, A3) are in unit structure, the constituent parts, such as spindle cooler 103, chip collector 104, hydraulic units 102, 202, spindle cooler 103, and coolant tank 204 are independent in each one of the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3) , and are small in size, and can be mounted on the apparatus frame 101 of each processing cell A (A1, A2, A3) , so that the entire system is simplified and reduced in size.<br>
The foregoing examples are only preferred embodiments of the invention, and the invention is not limited to them alone, but may be changed and modified in various designs.<br>
For example, in the illustrated embodiments, the work conveying route 1 is formed in a loop, and the honing jig 20 is circulated from the work delivery position Pi and back to<br><br>
this work delivery position P1 again, but it may be also formed in a straight line, and continued to a next process. In such a case, although not shown, for example, the work W is mounted on the honing jig 20 at the work delivery position, and is dismounted from the honing jig 20 at the work discharge position, and only the honing jig 20 is returned to the work delivery position.<br>
The internal structure of the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3), B, and C for composing the honing system and the specific structure of each unit are not limited to the illustrated embodiments, but may be freely changed or modified.<br>
For example, in the processing cells A (A1, A2, A3) of the illustrated embodiments, the detecting device 6 is installed in a station independent from the honing machine 5, but it may be installed integrally with the honing machine 5 so as to measure in process.<br>
In the illustrated embodiments, the machine tool is the automatic honing system for hole processing consisting of processing cell A1 having accuracy boring machine 5a, and processing cells A2, A3 having honing machines 5b, 5c, but the invention may be applied in various automatic machine tool systems including the machine tools of single type or machine tools of plural types.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br><br>
As described herein, according to the processing cells of the invention, having a unit structure at least comprising a conveying device for composing a part of a work conveying route, a single machine tool, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling, since these cells are incorporated in the automatic machining system to compose the machining section freely so as to be increased or decreased in number, for example, in the case of an automatic honing system having honing machines as machine tools, the following effects are obtained, and the structure is small, lightweight and simple, and the number of process can be determined or changed easily, the design is free, and the apparatus cost can be saved, and processing cells of automatic machining system having such features are presented.<br>
(1)	The number of process in the honing process is<br>
determined by the accuracy of shape of the prepared hole of the<br>
work, stock removal, and required shape accuracy, and in the<br>
stage of trial production, the accuracy of prepared hole shape<br>
and stock removal are not stable, while the processing cells<br>
of the invention are designed to be incorporated in the honing<br>
section of the automatic honing system by increasing or<br>
decreasing in number freely, and therefore if the number of<br>
process cannot be determined early, it can be determined<br>
effectively later.<br>
(2)	By the same reason, if the accuracy of the prepared<br><br>
hole of the work is changed, or if the required processing accuracy of the work is changed, by properly combining the processing cells which can be freely increased or decreased in number, the number of process can be changed promptly and easily.<br>
(3)	Also by the same reason, if it is difficult to predict the production amount of works, the capital investment can be determined easily by considering changeover of multiple models or dispersion of processes including the processing cells freely increased or decreased in number.<br>
(4)	Moreover, since the processing cells are composed in unit structure comprising the conveying device composing a part of the work conveying route, a single honing machine, and a control unit for linking them mutually and controlling, so as to be freely increased or decreased in number, if production of the specific works designed to be processed is stopped, in order to use for machining of other works differing in shape, dimension and machining conditions, part of the system may be modified or changed, the processing cells can be properly increased or decreased, depending on the shape, dimensions and processing conditions of the works, so that the apparatus cost can be lowered.<br>
(5)	Further, since the processing cells are in cell<br>
structure, hydraulic units as drive source of the constituent<br>
devices, and coolant tanks used in machining, and others can<br><br>
be set independently and reduced in size in each processing cell, and can be mounted on the main body frame of each processing cell, so that the entire system is simplified and reduced in size, and hence the apparatus cost can be lowered.<br>
(6) Further, in the automatic honing system having accuracy boring machine as prior process by the honing machine as the machine tool, since the work is processed by the boring machine prior to honing process by the honing machine, the prepared hole of the work can be enhanced in accuracy by correction to increase the stock removal by heat treatment or straightening, forced correction regardless of processing accuracy (roundness, cylindricality, etc.), and correction of end face squareness or concentricity that could not be corrected in the conventional honing process.<br>
As a result, the final finish accuracy in this automatic honing system is free from effects of the processing accuracy of the prepared hole of the work, so that hole processing of higher accuracy can be done in a smaller number of process.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
