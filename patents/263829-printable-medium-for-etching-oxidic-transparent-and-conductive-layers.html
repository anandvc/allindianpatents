				<td>Printable medium for etching oxidic,<br>
transparent and conductive layers<br>
The present invention relates to novel printable etching media having<br>
improved properties for use in the process for the production of solar<br>
cells. These are corresponding particle-containing compositions by<br>
means of which extremely fine lines and structures can be etched very<br>
selectively without damaging or attacking adjacent areas.<br>
Prior art and object of the invention<br>
During the process for the production of solar cells, it is necessary, inter<br>
alia, to structure oxide layers on a support material. A crystalline silicon<br>
solar cell usually consists of a p-conducting substrate into which a layer<br>
of an n-conducting substance, for example phosphorus, of homogeneous<br>
thickness is diffused on the front. In order to conduct away the current<br>
generated during incidence of light, metallically conducting contacts<br>
are applied to the front and back of the wafer. For the purposes of an inexpensive<br>
production method which is suitable for mass production, the<br>
contacts are usually produced by means of screen printing.<br>
Besides the oxide layers which have to be structured during the produc-<br>
tion of solar cells, silicon nitride layers also have to be etched. For the<br>
etching of corresponding nitride layers, the methods used have to be<br>
modified and the etching pastes adapted in a suitable manner.<br>
The surfaces of crystalline silicon solar cells are coated with thin inor-<br>
ganic layers during the production process, and if desired also when it is<br>
complete. These layers have thicknesses in the range from 20 to 200<br>
nm, in most cases in the range from 50 to 150 nm.<br>
In the course of the process for the production of crystalline silicon solar<br>
cells, it is therefore advantageous to etch fine lines into these inorganic<br>
layers of the solar cell in a number of process steps.<br><br>
These openings in the surface of the solar cell can be used, for example,<br>
for the generation of a so-called selective emitter, also known as two-<br>
stage emitter. To this end, high n-doping is produced in a subsequent<br>
diffusion step in the partial openings of a diffusion barrier located on the<br>
silicon, preferably by means of phosphorus diffusing in.<br>
In the present description, inorganic surfaces are taken to mean oxidic<br>
and nitride-containing compounds of silicon, in particular silicon oxide<br>
and silicon nitride surfaces. The way in which diffusion barriers of this<br>
type work is known to the person skilled in the art and is described in the<br>
literature [A. Goetzberger; B. VoB; J. Knobloch, Sonnenenergie: Photo-<br>
voltaik [Solar Energy: Photovoltaics], Teubner Studienbucher Stuttgart<br>
1997, pp 40, 107]. These diffusion barriers can be produced here in a<br>
variety of ways:<br>
Very dense silicon dioxide layers are obtained, for example, by heat<br>
treatment of silicon in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at temperatures<br>
in the region of 900Â°C (thermal oxide).<br>
Likewise known to the person skilled in the art is the deposition of silicon<br>
dioxide by the CVD process. Depending on the way in which the reaction<br>
is carried out, a distinction is made, inter alia, between the following<br>
processes<br>
-	APCVD (atmospheric pressure CVD)<br>
-	PE-CVD (plasma enhanced CVD)<br>
-	LP-CVD (low pressure CVD)<br>
A common feature of these processes is that the desired inorganic com-<br>
pound is obtained from the gas phase of a volatile precursor, in the ex-<br>
ample silicon dioxide this is, for example, silane (SiH4) or TEOS (tetra-<br>
ethyl orthosilicate), by deposition of the precursor on the target substrate<br>
with decomposition.<br>
Silicon dioxide layers which represent a diffusion barrier can also be ob-<br>
tained by means of wet-chemical coating with a liquid or dissolved solid<br>
precursor in a solvent or solvent mixture. These liquid systems are usu-<br><br>
ally applied by spin coating to the substrate to be coated. These systems<br>
are known to the person skilled in the art as spin-on-glass (SOG).<br>
In many cases, the applied SiO2 layer also remains as reflection-reduc-<br>
ing passivation layer. This is frequently the case, in particular, in the<br>
case of thermally grown SiO2.<br>
Apart from silicon oxide layers, transparent conductive layers (TCOs)<br>
play an important role (for example LC displays, touch panels, etc.).<br>
Besides ZnO compounds with binary or ternary doping (such as, for<br>
example, indium-zinc oxide, Al-ZnO, antimony-ZnO), the indium-tin oxide<br>
layers in particular are widespread. Indium-tin oxides are mixed oxides<br>
consisting of indium oxide (ln2O3) and tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) (but can also<br>
be used with other dopants, such as, for example, fluorine as FI:SnO2).<br>
These TCO layers are referred to below by way of example as ITO.<br>
These transparent semiconductors have the property of being electrically<br>
conductive and transparent. In the electronics industry, they are<br>
employed for the production of thin-film solar cells, transparent elec-<br>
trodes in liquid-crystal screens, organic light-emitting diodes and touch<br>
screens. As a semiconductor which strongly reflects infrared radiation,<br>
ITO is applied in a scattered manner or over a large area as thermal<br>
protection to sheets of window glass. A very wide variety of surfaces, for<br>
example plastic films, can likewise be coated with ITO in order that they<br>
do not become electrostatically charged.<br>
ITO usually consists of 90% of indium oxide (ln2O3) and 10% of tin(IV)<br>
oxide (SnO2). The tin(IV) oxide, as dopant, produces the flaws necessary<br>
for good electrical conductivity in the crystal structure of the indium<br>
oxide. Thin layers of typically about 200 nm have high transparency and<br>
have a surface resistance of about 6 ohm/cm2.<br>
ITO is usually applied to the corresponding substrates - almost always<br>
glasses - by cathode sputtering. However, ITO can also be applied by<br>
high-vacuum vapour deposition, although the components coated by<br>
vapour deposition have to be warmed to up to 360Â°C, which restricts the<br>
applicability.<br><br>
Silicon nitride layers are used less as diffusion barriers in the technology<br>
of crystalline solar cells, although they are in principle likewise suitable<br>
for this purpose. Silicon nitride layers are essentially used as passivation<br>
and antireflection layer.<br>
In the production of crystalline silicon solar cells, it is advantageous also<br>
to be able to produce openings in a targeted manner in silicon nitride<br>
layers. An example which may be mentioned here is the application of<br>
electrically conductive pastes. These metal pastes are usually "fired"<br>
through the silicon nitride layer at temperatures of about 600Â°C, enabling<br>
electrical contact to the emitter layer. Due to the high temperatures,<br>
polymer-based (epoxy or phenolic resin) metallisation pastes therefore<br>
cannot be used for this purpose. Crystal defects and metallic contamina-<br>
tion in the underlying silicon also arise during performance of the fire-<br>
through process. As a consequence of the system, the passivation layer<br>
is in addition totally destroyed by the printed-on metal paste on top. It<br>
would therefore be more advantageous to produce a partial, narrower<br>
opening in the silicon nitride layer for electrical contacting and to retain<br>
the passivation layer in the edge regions, which are masked by the met-<br>
allisation layer on top.<br>
Besides pure diffusion barriers consisting of silicon dioxide or silicon<br>
nitride, it is also possible to use thin glass layers in the production of<br>
crystalline silicon solar cells.<br>
Definition of glass:<br>
Glass is taken to mean per se a uniform composition, for example<br>
quartz, window glass, borosilicate glass, but also thin layers of these<br>
materials produced on other substrates (for example ceramics, metal<br>
sheets, silicon wafers) by various methods known to the person skilled in<br>
the art (CVD, PVD, spin-on, thermal oxidation, inter alia).<br>
Glasses below are taken to mean silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-con-<br>
taining materials which are in the solid amorphous physical state without<br>
the glass components crystallising out and have a high degree of dis-<br>
order in the microstructure owing to the lack of long-range order.<br><br>
Besides pure SiO2 glass (quartz), these encompass all glasses (for<br>
example doped glasses, such as borosilicate, phosphosilicate and boro-<br>
phosphosilicate glasses, coloured glasses, milk glasses, crystal glasses,<br>
optical glasses) which contain SiO2 and other components, in particular<br>
elements such as, for example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lead, lith-<br>
ium, magnesium, barium, potassium, boron, beryllium, phosphorus, gal-<br>
lium, arsenic, antimony, lanthanum, zinc, thorium, copper, chromium,<br>
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, gold,<br>
platinum, palladium, silver, cerium, caesium, niobium, tantalum, zircon-<br>
ium, neodymium, praseodymium, which occur in the glasses in the form<br>
of oxides, carbonates, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and/or halides or<br>
function as doping elements in the glasses. Doped glasses are, for<br>
example, borosilicate, phosphosilicate and borophosphosilicate glasses,<br>
coloured glasses, milk glasses, crystal glasses and optical glasses.<br>
The silicon nitride may likewise comprise other elements, such as boron,<br>
aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic or antimony.<br>
Definition of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
Silicon oxide-based systems are defined below as all crystalline systems<br>
which do not fall under the definition of amorphous SiO2 glasses given<br>
above and are based on silicon dioxide; these can be, in particular, the<br>
salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation products thereof -<br>
generally referred to as silicates by the person skilled in the art - as well<br>
as quartz and glass-ceramics.<br>
Furthermore, other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems, in<br>
particular the salts and esters of orthosilicic acid and condensation prod-<br>
ucts thereof, are also encompassed. Besides pure SiO2 (quartz, tridy-<br>
mite, cristobalite), all SiO2-based systems built up from SiO2 or "discrete"<br>
and/or linked [SiO4] tetrahedra, such as, for example, mesosilicates,<br>
sorosilicates, cyclosilicates, inosilicates, phyllosilicates, tectosilicates,<br>
and comprising other components, in particular elements/components<br>
such as, for example, calcium, sodium, aluminium, lithium, magnesium,<br>
barium, potassium, beryllium, scandium, manganese, iron, titanium, zir-<br>
conium, zinc, cerium, yttrium, oxygen, hydroxyl groups, halides, are also<br>
encompassed.<br><br>
Silicon nitride-based systems are defined below as all crystalline and<br>
partially crystalline (usually referred to as microcrystalline) systems<br>
which do not fall under the definition of amorphous silicon nitride<br>
glasses/layers given above. These include Si3N4 in its modifications as<br>
a-Si3N4 and p-Si3N4 and all crystalline and partially crystalline SiNx and<br>
SiNx:H layers. Crystalline silicon nitride may comprise other elements,<br>
such as boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, phosphorus, arsenic and<br>
antimony.<br>
Etching of structures<br>
The use of etchants, i.e. chemically aggressive compounds, results in<br>
the dissolution of the material exposed to the etchant attack. In most<br>
cases, the aim is completely to remove the layer to be etched. The end<br>
of the etching is reached by the encountering of a layer which is sub-<br>
stantially resistant to the etchant. In addition, there is the process known<br>
to the person skilled in the art of partial removal of a layer by etching to a<br>
target thickness which is usually defined.<br>
Etching of structures on silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses<br>
and other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
According to the current state of the art, any desired structures can be<br>
etched selectively in silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems or surfaces thereof<br>
and layers thereof of variable thickness directly by laser-supported etch-<br>
ing methods or, after masking, by wet-chemical methods ([1] D.J. Monk,<br>
D.S. Soane, R.T. Howe, Thin Solid Films 232 (1993), 1; [2]J. Buhler, F.-<br>
P. Steiner, H. Baltes, J. Micromech. Microeng. 7 (1997), R1) or by dry-<br>
etching methods ([3] M. Kdhler "Atzverfahren fur die Mikrotechnik"<br>
[Etching Methods for Microtechnology], Wiley VCH 1983).<br>
In the laser-supported etching methods, the laser beam scans the entire<br>
etching pattern on the glass dot by dot or line by line in the case of vec-<br>
tor-orienting systems, which, besides a high degree of precision, also<br>
requires considerable adjustment effort and time.<br><br>
The wet-chemical and dry-etching methods include material-intensive,<br>
time-consuming and expensive process steps:<br>
A.	Masking of the areas not to be etched, for example by:<br>
â¢	photolithography: Production of a negative or positive of the etching<br>
structure (depending on the resist), coating of the substrate surface<br>
(for example by spin-coating with a liquid photoresist), drying of the<br>
photoresist, exposure of the coated substrate surface, development,<br>
rinsing, optionally drying<br>
B.	Etching of the structures by:<br>
â¢	dip methods (for example wet etching in wet-chemistry benches): dip-<br>
ping of the substrates into the etching bath, etching operation,<br>
repeated rinsing in H2O cascade sinks, drying<br>
â¢	spin-on or spray methods: the etching solution is applied to a rotating<br>
substrate, the etching operation can be carried out without or with<br>
input of energy (for example IR or UV irradiation), this is followed by<br>
rinsing and drying<br>
â¢	dry-etching methods, such as, for example, plasma etching, in expen-<br>
sive vacuum units or etching with reactive gases in flow reactors<br>
C.	Removal of the photoresist:<br>
In a final process step, the photoresist covering the protecting areas of<br>
the substrate must be removed. This can be carried out by means of sol-<br>
vents, such as, for example, acetone, or dilute aqueous alkaline solu-<br>
tions. The substrates are finally rinsed and dried.<br>
Full-area etching of silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and<br>
other silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems:<br>
In order to etch silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other<br>
silicon oxide- and silicon nitride-based systems and layers of variable<br><br>
thickness thereof over the entire area completely or only to a certain<br>
depth, use is predominantly made of wet-etching methods. The silicon<br>
oxide- and silicon nitride-based glasses and other silicon oxide- and sili-<br>
con nitride-based systems and layers of variable thickness thereof are<br>
dipped into etching baths, which usually contain the toxic and highly<br>
caustic hydrofluoric acid and optionally additives of other mineral acids.<br>
The disadvantages of the etching methods described are due to the<br>
time-consuming, material-intensive and expensive process steps, which<br>
are in some cases very complex in technological and safety terms and,<br>
in addition, are frequently carried out discontinuously.<br>
International Application WO 01/83391 A describes etching media in the<br>
form of printable, homogeneous, particle-free etching pastes having non-<br>
Newtonian flow behaviour for the etching of inorganic, glass-like amor-<br>
phous or crystalline surfaces, in particular of glasses or ceramics, pref-<br>
erably SiO2- or silicon nitride-based systems, and the use of these etch-<br>
ing media. In particular on printing of surfaces, use of these particle-free<br>
media gives rise to problems due to inadequate resilience of the printed<br>
lines, dots or structures (inadequate structure fidelity), meaning that a<br>
significant broadening of the originally printed lines occurs (running of<br>
the etching species on the substrate).<br>
US 5,688,366 A uses particle-containing etching pastes for etching a<br>
transparent conductive layer, such as, for example, an ITO layer. The<br>
etching pastes used are prepared from molten iron chloride containing<br>
water of crystallisation, glycerol and polymer particles. These composi-<br>
tions are suitable for etching lines having a width of about 1 mm.<br>
Experiments have shown that these etching pastes are not suitable for<br>
etching very thin lines having a width of less than 1 mm cleanly and<br>
without flaws, irrespective of whether polymer particles having a diame-<br>
ter of 0.01 urn or of 30 urn are employed for the preparation of the<br>
pastes.<br><br>
Objective<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide novel, inex-<br>
pensive etching pastes for etching very uniform, thin lines having a width<br>
of less than 100 urn, in particular less than 80 urn, and extremely fine<br>
structures on silicon dioxide and/or silicon nitride layers, in particular also<br>
in conductive layers, which are located on silicon solar cells. A further<br>
object of the present invention is to provide novel etching media which<br>
can be removed from the treated surfaces after the etching in a simple<br>
manner without leaving residues and have more environmentally friendly<br>
properties than known pastes.<br>
Brief description of the invention<br>
The object is achieved by a novel printable, dispensable etching medium<br>
for etching oxidic transparent and conductive surfaces and layers in the<br>
form of an etching paste comprising<br>
a)	phosphoric acid,<br>
b)	at least one solvent,<br>
c)	graphite and/or carbon black having a relative particle diameter in<br>
the range from 80 nm to 20 nm and a specific BET surface area<br>
in the range from 40 to 100 m2/g,<br>
d)	optionally thickeners, and<br>
e)	optionally additives, such as antifoams, thixotropic agents, flow-<br>
control agents, deaerators and adhesion promoters.<br>
In a particular embodiment, etching media of this type comprise graphite<br>
or carbon-black powder having relative particle diameters of less than 50<br>
nm and a specific BET surface area in the range from 50 to 70 m2/g. It<br>
has proven particularly advantageous for the graphite or carbon-black<br>
powder present to have relative particle diameters in the range from<br>
30 nm to 45 nm. Etching media comprising carbon-black powder having<br>
a relative particle diameter of 40 nm and a specific BET surface area of<br>
62 m2/g have very particularly good properties. While higher proportions<br>
of solids were necessary in earlier compositions, the addition of less than<br>
8% by weight, but more than 0.5% by weight, of graphite or carbon-black<br>
powder having the said properties gives, in accordance with the inven-<br><br>
tion, compositions which can be printed in the form of extremely fine<br>
lines. Compositions which have a graphite or carbon-black powder con-<br>
tent in the range from 3 to 7% by weight and a viscosity in the range<br>
from 25 to 35 Pas have particularly good properties. Corresponding<br>
compositions can advantageously be used for etching ITO layers at tem-<br>
peratures between 120-170Â°C.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The novel paste formulations have significantly improved properties with<br>
respect to surface cleaning, print precision and waste-water pollution<br>
after the etching operation. Surprisingly, it has been found that the etch-<br>
ing pastes to which extremely fine-particulate inorganic powders, in par-<br>
ticular fine-particulate graphite and/or carbon black, have been added<br>
have improved cleaning properties if they are employed for etching ITO<br>
at temperatures between 120-170Â°C, compared with pastes to which<br>
commercially available graphite or carbon black has been added. The<br>
subsequent cleaning of the treated surfaces is carried out with deionised<br>
water.<br>
An essential advantage of the novel paste formulations according to the<br>
invention furthermore consists in that the inorganic powders present<br>
remain unchanged and do not melt at the etching temperatures, but<br>
contribute to the fact that the etching paste can be applied to the sur-<br>
faces in extremely thin lines or extremely fine structures without running<br>
and bleeding and are able subsequently to diffuse to the site of action<br>
during the etching operation. In particular, the use of inorganic graphite<br>
or carbon-black powder having relative particle diameters of less than 80<br>
nm, in particular less than 50 nm, preferably 45 nm to 30 nm, and a spe-<br>
cific BET surface area in the range from 40 to 100 m2/g, preferably from<br>
50 to 70 m2/g, gives improved results. The use of carbon-black powders<br>
having particle diameters of about 40 nm and a specific BET surface<br>
area of about 62 m2/g is very particularly preferred. The use of these<br>
carbon-black powders gives particularly good etching results. Compared<br>
with the use of polymer powders, whose smallest particle sizes are 3-5<br><br>
|jm, significantly finer lines and smaller structures can be printed and<br>
etched due to the addition of nanoparticulate carbon-black particles, i.e.<br>
significantly improved printing precision is achieved, and significantly<br>
smaller structures can be printed and etched on ITO. Consequently,<br>
novel potential applications in simple displays and also in high-resolution<br>
TFT displays arise, as shown by Figures 1 to 4.<br>
The pastes according to the invention are prepared using commercially<br>
available graphite or carbon-black powders which have the properties<br>
described above and meet the size and surface requirements. Mention<br>
may be made here by way of example of the commercial product Super<br>
Pâ¢ (conductive carbon black from TIMCAL Graphite &amp; Carbon, Switzer-<br>
land). The particle sizes can generally be determined using conventional<br>
methods. For example, the particle size can be determined by means of<br>
particle correlation spectroscopy (PCS), with the investigation being car-<br>
ried out using a Malvern Zetasizer in accordance with the instruction<br>
manual. The diameter of the particles is determined here as the dso or<br>
dgo value. The particle diameters indicated are preferably quoted as d50<br>
values.<br>
The particle diameters can generally be determined by means of laser<br>
diffraction combined with on-line analysis. To this end, a laser beam is<br>
shone into a particle cloud distributed in a transparent gas, for example<br>
air. The particles refract the light, with small particles refracting the light<br>
at a greater angle than large particles. The scatter angle is thus directly<br>
correlated to the particle size. The observed scatter angle increases<br>
logarithmically with decreasing particle size. The refracted light is meas-<br>
ured by a number of photodetectors arranged at various angles. The<br>
measurements are preferably evaluated using Mie light diffraction theory,<br>
which is based on Maxwell's electromagnetic field equation. This theory<br>
is based on two assumptions. Firstly, it is assumed that the particles to<br>
be measured are spherical, but this only really applies to few particles.<br>
The measured laser diffraction is used to calculate the volume of parti-<br>
cles. Secondly, dilute particle suspensions are assumed. The method<br>
usually used to determine particle sizes in the nano range by dynamic<br><br>
light scattering is described in greater detail in the brochure "Dynamic<br>

The particle size in the nanoparticulate range can also be determined<br>
with the aid of scanning electron photomicrographs (SEM photographs).<br>
To this end, particle-containing emulsions can be prepared and applied<br>
to a suitable surface in an extremely thin layer in a spin-coating process.<br>
After evaporation of the solvent, SEM photographs are taken and the<br>
particle diameters recorded are measured. The relative particle diameter<br>
of the measured sample is determined by statistical evaluation. Stan-<br>
dardised methods for determining particle sizes and devices suitable for<br>
this purpose are described in ISO 13321, Methods for Determination of<br>
Particle Size Distribution Part 8: Photon Correlation Spectroscopy, International<br>
Organisation for Standardisation [(ISO) 1996 (First Edition<br>
1996-07-01)], including methods for determining sizes in the nm measurement<br>
range.<br>
It has proven particularly advantageous that the use in accordance with<br>
the invention of nanoparticulate carbon black enables the addition of<br>
solids to the etching paste compositions to be significantly reduced. Surprisingly,<br>
it has been found that the percentage of solid in the etching<br>
paste can be reduced by more than 70% by weight if nanoparticulate<br>
carbon-black powder is employed compared with the use of polymer<br>
particles in pastes of comparable viscosity. This applies, in particular, to<br>
the use of graphite and/or carbon black having relative particle diameters<br>
in the range from 20 nm to 80 nm and a specific BET surface area in the<br>
range from 40 to 100 m2/g.<br>
In particular if carbon-black particles having relative particle diameters of<br>
about 40 nm and a specific BET surface area of about 62 m2/g are used<br>
as solid in a corresponding composition, the addition of solids can be<br>
reduced by about 74% compared with the addition of polymer particles<br>
having a relative particle diameter in the range 3-5 urn in order to prepare<br>
a paste having a viscosity of less than 40 Pas, in particular about<br>
30 Pas. In this way, a significantly more environmentally friendly paste<br>
can be prepared. This also enables the service life of the waste-water<br>
filters necessary for the removal of suspended particles from the waste<br><br>
water to be considerably extended, more precisely for the removal of the<br>
suspended particles from the waste water produced in the rinsing opera-<br>
tions for cleaning the etched surfaces.<br>
Surprisingly, measurements have shown that the rinsed-off carbon-black<br>
particles (active carbon) have an adsorptive action for the organic thick-<br>
ener additives and organic solvent components of the paste. This has<br>
the consequence that the BOD5 value (mg/l) in the rinse water can be<br>
reduced by simple particle filtration. The BOD5 value is the biological<br>
oxygen demand (mg/l) of waste water in 5 days, measured in accor-<br>
dance with DIN 38409 H51. Whereas a BOD5 value of 14 mg/l is deter-<br>
mined, for example, on use of an etching paste comprising polymer par-<br>
ticles with otherwise identical composition, a BOD5 value of only<br>
7-8 mg/l arises for pastes comprising carbon-black particles added in<br>
accordance with the invention for the same amount of paste in the rinse<br>
water in each case (135 mg of paste/0.51 of rinse water).<br>
An effective etching component which has proven particularly effective<br>
is, in particular, phosphoric acid, more precisely in concentrations in the<br>
range from about 35 to 50% by weight. Compositions having a phospho-<br>
ric acid concentration in the range from 40 to 50% by weight have<br>
proven particularly effective. They have very particularly advantageous<br>
properties since they can be printed well onto the surfaces and give very<br>
good etching results. Particular preference is given to etching pastes<br>
having a phosphoric acid content of 45 to 46% by weight.<br>
In order to prepare the etching pastes, the various components are<br>
mixed with one another successively with adequate mixing in such a way<br>
that the temperature is only able to increase moderately during the addi-<br>
tion of etching component, but a paste having a suitable viscosity forms<br>
during the mixing.<br>
As already indicated above, etching pastes can be printed in particularly<br>
fine lines and structures if graphite and/or carbon black having a relative<br>
particle diameter in the range from 20 nm to 80 nm and a specific BET<br>
surface area in the range from 40 to 100 m2/g are present therein. The<br>
surface nature of the particles here is not only of importance for the<br><br>
properties as etching paste, but also, as described above, considerably<br>
influences the environmental acceptability of the pastes.<br>
For the preparation of the pastes according to the invention, graphite<br>
and/or carbon black having a relative particle diameter of less than<br>
50 nm and a specific BET surface area in the range 50 to 70 m2/g are<br>
therefore preferably used. Particular preference is given to powders<br>
having relative particle diameters in the range from 30 nm to 45 nm and<br>
very particularly preferably carbon-black powders having a relative parti-<br>
cle diameter of 40 nm and a specific BET surface area of 62 m2/g, since<br>
these compositions result in particularly low BOD5 values.<br>
In order to result in the advantageous paste properties, the solids parti-<br>
cles in the form of graphite and/or carbon black must be present in the<br>
compositions in amounts of less than 8% by weight. 3 to 7% by weight of<br>
the nanoparticulate graphite or carbon-black powder are preferably<br>
added to the pastes. In particular, the addition of about 5 to 6% by<br>
weight gives etching pastes having a viscosity in the range from 25 to<br>
35 Pas, which can be printed extremely well, as shown very clearly by<br>
the etch pictures in Fig. 1 to Fig. 4. However, addition of less nano-<br>
particulate carbon black or graphite in an amount of 0.5% by weight also<br>
already results in improved behaviour during printing compared with the<br>
use of pastes in which polymer particles are present in the same<br>
amount. Even these small amounts of particles enable printing with a<br>
reduced line width.<br>
Besides the nanoparticulate graphite or carbon black, the pastes may<br>
comprise thickeners and optionally additives, such as antifoams, thixo-<br>
tropic agents, flow-control agents, deaerators and adhesion promoters.<br>
' Solvents which may be incorporated are water and/or organic solvents.<br>
Thus, the pastes according to the invention may comprise water, poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone and 1-methylpyrrolidone besides the basic constituents<br>
of phosphoric acid and carbon-black or graphite powder. Whereas<br>
1-methylpyrrolidone may be present in the same amounts as phosphoric<br>
acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone is usually present in an amount of less than<br>
10% by weight, preferably in an amount of about 5 to 6% by weight.<br><br>
Additives having advantageous properties for the desired purpose are<br>
antifoams, such as, for example, those available under the trade name<br>
TEGOÂ® Foamex N,<br>
thixotropic agents, such as BYKÂ® 410, BorchigelÂ® Thixo2,<br>
flow-control agents, such as TEGOÂ® Glide ZG 400,<br>
deaerators, such as TEGOÂ® Airex 985, and<br>
adhesion promoters, such as BayowetÂ® FT 929.<br>
It goes without saying per se to the person skilled in the art that these<br>
additives may also be replaced by other commercially available products<br>
with the same action. It is essential in this connection that the addition of<br>
such additives improves the product properties.<br>
Additives employed specifically in experiments carried out are also<br>
revealed in the examples given below.<br>
These may have a positive influence on the printability of the etching<br>
paste. The proportion of the additives is in the range 0-5% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the etching paste.<br>
The etching pastes according to the invention can be printed on the<br>
wafer surfaces in a known manner. In particular, they are applied in fine<br>
line printing 
having the following parameters:<br><br>
Figures 1 to 4 show etching results for the production of which lines of<br>
different thickness have been printed. In addition, it can be seen from<br>
these figures that lines at a separation of less than 100 urn can be<br>
etched using the pastes according to the invention without having to use<br>
photoresist layers. It is therefore possible to produce high-resolution<br>
etched structures in a simple manner using the etching pastes according<br>
to the invention.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows an etched line having a width of 20.93 urn which has been<br>
etched into an ITO layer.<br>
Fig. 2 shows three etched lines having a width of 37.95 urn alongside<br>
one another, in each case at a separation of 98.26 urn.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the continuous structure of an etched line having a width of<br>
38.4 um.<br>
It can be seen from the etch pictures shown that the etching pastes<br>
according to the invention are suitable for continuously etching even<br>
extremely thin lines without termination of the lines occurring in the<br>
course of the etched tracks.<br>
Examples<br>
For better understanding and in order to illustrate the invention, exam-<br>
ples are given below which are within the scope of protection of the pre-<br>
sent invention. These examples also serve to illustrate possible variants.<br>
Owing to the general validity of the inventive principle described, how-<br>
ever, the examples are not suitable for reducing the scope of protection<br>
of the present application to these alone.<br>
It goes without saying per se to the person skilled in the art that, both in<br>
the examples given and also in the remainder of the description, the<br>
component amounts present in the paste compositions always add up in<br>
total only to 100% and cannot be greater even if higher values could<br>
arise from the per cent ranges indicated.<br>
Example 1<br>
Etching paste comprising an inorganic nanoparticulate solid additive<br>
218 g of deionised water<br>
223 g of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
1.6 g of ethylene glycol<br>
The following are added successively with stirring to this solvent mixture:<br><br>
465 g of phosphoric acid (85%)<br>
and<br>
11 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
where polyvinylpyrrolidone is incorporated with vigorous stirring.<br>
50 g of carbon black<br>
are then added to the clear homogeneous mixture, which is stirred for a<br>
further 2 hours.<br>
The ready-to-use paste can be printed using a 280 mesh stainless-steel<br>
fabric screen. In principle, polyesters or similar screen materials can also<br>
be used. The crucial factor is that the screen material selected is inert to<br>
the etching component present in the etching composition.<br>
The etching paste prepared has proven to be stable on storage over a<br>
long period with retention of the advantageous etching properties.<br>
Further examples of compositions according to the invention having<br>
advantageous properties are given in the following tables:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
