				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention  relates  to a pin bar for  use  with a   stenter machine.<br>
KNOWN ART<br>
it is generally known that a fabric is first dyed, and the wet fabric with the dye thereon is dried on a stenter machine. For this purpose, the fabric passes through a heating zone by means of a conveyor. The fabric is held on both edges by pin bars in a stretched condition. Such pin bars are fixed on the conveyor at regular intervals.<br>
The known pin bars comprised a base support with pins mounted thereon. The  bars  had  a  longitudinal  ridge  to provide a  first  inclined surface and a second horizontal surface.  The width  of the  inclined surface was narrower than that of  the  second  or wider surface, and the pin bar was positioned and held to the fabric such  that the first inclined  surface  was in contact and  in  the direction of the fabric Hitherto  such  pin  bars  were  made of brass.  As the dyes and other chemicals  present  on  the  fabric  are  highly corrosive in  nature, it  was  hitherto  considered  necessary to provide such bars of brass However, to  provide  such  bars  of brass considerably contributed to the  end  cost  of the pin bar.  It  would  be apparent that such bars could  not  be  made  of  mild  steel  as the dyes and other chemicals would corrode the bar.  Alternatively, and to prevent such a corrosive action,  the bars could have been made of aluminium.<br>
- 2-<br><br>
However, a disadvantage of aluminium is that it has a hugh, coefficient of expansion at elevated temperatures and would tend to deform during the drying process.<br>
Reference is hereby drawn to prior patent No.GB 2140838 wherein a device for holding edge of a piece fabric is disclosed which device has narrated a covered locking arm pivotable about a pivot to move a set of pins from between another set of pins carried through a carrier to allow fabric to be engaged and disengaged from the said pins before and after the fabric passed through the starter.<br>
In contrast to the said prior art the present invention comprises a support base made of plastic and having a first and second inclined surface each extending downwardly from a longitudinal axis of the bar and a plurality of pins molded on said bar in which the angle of inclination of the second surface is greater or equal to said first surface and the second surface has a width greater or equal to said first surface.<br>
In another prior art FR 2621334 has disclosed a chain for equipping a stenter which is characterized by providing bodies of clamps and/or the bodies of pin carriers, the pin carrier plates and optionally the body of driving links being coated substantially with a layer of thermally stable solid polymer which is endowed with release properties and the average thickness of which is preferably at least 10 micrometers.<br>
The said prior art cannot have any comparison with the inventive features of the present invention. The two slopes in opposite direction in case of the pin bar developed by the present invention does not allow the dye flowing out of the fabric (while passing through the stenter) to get accumulated in the pin bar thus preventing any dye marks on the fabric, thus avoiding accumulation of dye staining the fabric and causing colour variation as prevailing in the prior arts with brass pin bar.<br>
- 3-<br><br>
The present invention thus produce technical effect and its inventive merit is quite different from the abovementioned two prior arts.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a pin bar.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a pin bar which is not susceptible to a corrosive attack from the dyes or other chemicals contained on the fabric.<br>
Yet another object of mis invention is to propose a pin bar which is cheaper than the known pin bars made of brass.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a pin bar which is efficient<br>
A further object of mis invention is to propose a pin bar and wherein the manufacturing time is reduced in comparison to the known pin bars.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a pin bar for using in stenter machines comprising a support base made of plastic and having a first and second inclined surface as herein defined each extending downwardly from a longitudinal axis of the bar and a plurality of pins moulded on said her.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
with  the accompanying drawings and wherein  Fig.l shows a  front elevational view of the pin bar of the present invention; and Fig.2 shows an end view.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the pin bar 1 of the present invention comprises a base support 2 made of suitable known plastic material. One end of base support 2 has an inclined surface 3 extending upwardly at one end and an inclined surface 4 extending downwardly at the opposite end. Such inclined surfaces are known in the art and are provided in a manner as required by the stenter machine manufacturer. A plurality of pins 5 are mounted on bar 2. Except for penultimate pin 5A at either ends, the pins are disposed in rows A and B and equally spaced from each other in any one row. Further, the pitches of the pins are equal .<br>
Reference is made in particular to Fig.2 and which illustrates an end view of pin bar 1. Pin bar 1 has a longitudinal axis C. A first inclined surface 6 is provided on one side of longitudinal axis C. A second inclined surface 7 is provided on the opposite side of longitudinal axis, each of said surfaces inclined downwardly so as to allow the entry of hot air and to thereby provide a faster and uniform drying of the fabric. In accordance with this invention, the angle of inclination of second inclined surface 7 is preferably smaller or the same as first inclined surface 6. Further, the width of second inclined surface 7 is equal or greater than that of first inclined surface<br>
-5—<br><br>
6. First inclined surface 6 faces the fabric.<br>
The pin bars 1 of the present invention are made by an injection moulding machine, and whereby 2 pin bars with plurality of pins moulded on the said bars can be manufactured in every 5 minutes. However, in the known pin bar, a period of 25 minutes was required to produce a single pin bar. As the pin bars are made of a plastic material, the dyes and other chemicals contained in the fabric no longer have a corrosive effect<br>

I CLAIM<br>
1.	A pin bar (1) for using in stenter machines comprising a support base (2) made of<br>
plastic and having a first and second inclined surface (6&amp;7) as herein defined extending<br>
downwardly from a longitudinal axis (c) of the bar and a plurality of pins (15) moulded<br>
on said bar (1).<br>
2.	A pin bar as claimed in claim 1, wherein the angle of inclination of me second<br>
surface is greater or equal to mat of said first surface.<br>
3.	A pin bar as claimed in claim 1 wherein the second surface has a width greater or<br>
equal to said first surface.<br>
4.	A pin bar substantially as herein described and illustrated.<br><br><br><br><br>
- 7 -<br>
This invention relates to a pin bar (1) for using in stenter machines comprising a support base (2) made of plastic and having a  first and second inclined surface (6&amp;7) as herein defined extending downwardly from a longitudinal axis (c) of the bar and a plurality of pins (15) moulded on said bar (1).</td>
