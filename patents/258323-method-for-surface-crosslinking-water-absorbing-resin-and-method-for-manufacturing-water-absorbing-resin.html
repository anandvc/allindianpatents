				<td>METHOD FOR SURFACE CROSSLINKING<br>
WATER-ABSORBING RESIN AND METHOD FOR<br>
MANUFACTURING WATER-ABSORBING RESIN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for surface crosslinking water-absorbing resin, and. particularly to a method for surface crosslinking water-absorbing rosin having excellent physical properties which method is suitable for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin on an<br>
industrial scale. Moreover, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing water-absorbing resin, and more particularly to a method for manufacturing high-quality water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine power of which is small, by carrying out a modifying step and/or a cooling step by using a stirrer having a specific configuration.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Water-absorbing resin has a property of absorbing a large amount of water, and is used as a material constituting sanitary goods such as paper diapers, sanitary napkins and incontinence pads, a water-retention agent for soil, a water sealing agent, a dew condensation preventing agent, a freshness keeping agent, a solvent dehydrating agent, a water-absorbing sheet of food, etc. As above, since the water-absorbing resin is widely used in the industry, the demand thereof is increasing more and more.<br>
Especially in the case of sanitary goods such as paper diapers, etc., in order to reduce the thickness of the goods, the amount of pulp tends to be reduced and the amount of water-absorbing resin used tends to be increased. Moreover, since diapers became widespread worldwide, the demand thereof is increasing more and more.<br>
Conventionally, by slightly crosslinking a hydrophilic polymer     (crosslinking     is     usually     carried     out    during<br>
polymerization),    water-absorbing    resin    having    a    water insoluble    property    and    a    water    swelling    property    is manufactured  normally  in  the  form  of powdery  particles. Examples of the water-absorbing resin are (i) a crosslinked polyacrylic acid partially neutralized product, (ii) hydrolysule of starch-acrylonitrile copolymer, (iii) a neutralized product of  a   starch-acrylic   acid   graft   polymer,   (iv)   a   saponified product    of    vinyl    acetate-acrylic    ester    copolymer,     (v) hydrolysate     of    acrylonitrile     copolymer     or     acrylamide copolymer,    (vi)   crosslinked   acrylonitrile   copolymer,    (vii) crosslinked      acrylamide      copolymer,      (viii)      crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose,     (ix)     crosslinked     copolymer     of 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic     acid     (AMPS),     (x) crosslinked        polyethylene        oxide,        (xi)        crosslinked polyallylamine,    and    (xii)     crosslinked    polyethylenimine. However, in recent, years, since there is a demand for high<br>
functions of the water-absorbing resin as improvements of performances of diapers, the method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin has been improved variously. For example, by, in addition to the internal crosslinking of the powder, surface crosslinking (secondary crosslinking) the resin subjected to polymerization, a crosslink density gradient is given to the inside and surface of the resin. This improves the water-absorbing speed, liquid permeability and absorbency against pressure of the water-absorbing resin.<br>
Then,   in   th.e   case   of  sanitary   goods   such   as   paper<br>
diapers, etc., in order to reduce the thickness of the goods,<br>
there    is   a   need   for   water-absorbing   resin   having   high<br>
absorbency  against  pressure.     Generally,   the  smaller the<br>
amount of fine powder (having a particle diameter of 150 jim<br>
or less) contained in the water-absorbing resin is, the better.<br>
This    is    because    the    fine    powder    causes    clogging    in<br>
water-absorbing goods such as diapers, and this becomes a<br>
factor   of   deteriorating   liquid    permeability.        Such   fine<br>
powder easily absorbs moisture, so that it becomes a factor of<br>
clogging in a process of manufacturing diapers, and moreover,<br>
it is not preferable for users in light of safety and health.<br>
Disclosed       as       a       method       for       manufacturing water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small, which has high absorbency against pressure, etc. is a method    for    (i)    adding    a    crosslinking    agent    to    dried water-absorbing resin powder, and (ii) when crosslinking the vicinity   of   the   surface   of  the   power   while   crushing   the mixture, using water-absorbing resin coarse particles whose weight average particle diameters are from 200 urn to 1,000 jam   (Document   1).      The   invention   of  Document   1   is   as follows: When the water-absorbing resin has small particle diameters,   the   water-absorbing   resin   forms   fish   eyes   by contacting with  aqueous  liquid,  and  an  absorption  speed deteriorates;    Therefore,     the    particle    diameter    of    the<br>
water-absorbing resin power before surface crosslinking is controlled to be large (coarse particles), and further, while crushing at least part of the particles, the vicinity of the surface is crosslinked; Thus, obtained is a water-absorbing agent, the amount of fine powder of which is small, and which has high absorbency against pressure and liquid permeability under pressure.<br>
Moreover, disclosed are (i) a method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin which method is characterized in that when surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin, a crosslinking reaction is completed at 90°C to 250°C by using a horizontal stirring drier, a rotary drier, a disc drier, a mix drier, a fluidized bed dryer, a through-flow dryer, an infrared dryer, etc. (Document 2), and (ii) a method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin which method is characterized in that  a   surface  crosslinking agent  is  added  to  an  internal crosslinked polymer prepared by sieve classification so that its particles are from  150 jam to 850 |um, and the resulting mixture  is  heated  by a  paddle  mixer  so  as  to  be  surface crosslinked (Document 3).<br>
However, there is a problem with the techniques of Documents 1 to 3 in that a large amount of coarse particles (aggregate of the water-absorbing resin) remain in the water-absorbing resin. When the coarse particles remains in the water-absorbing resin, the sense of use of the product<br>
such as diapers is not good. Therefore, it is necessary to remove those coarse particles. However, it is necessary to carry out, for example, classification to remove the coarse particles. Moreover, throwing away the classified coarse particles is economically disadvantageous. Meanwhile, crushing the coarse particles generates fine powder.<br>
Here, disclosed is a method for heating a mixture of the water-absorbing resin and a surface crosslinking agent-containing aqueous solution by using a stirring dryer including stirring boards having scraping blades or a stirring dryer including crushing means between stirring boards, so as to complete the surface crosslinking while suppressing the generation of the coarse particles (Document 4).<br>
Moreover, disclosed as a method for carrying out a surface crosslinking treatment of the water-absorbing resin by using a slirror including stirring boards is u method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin which method is characterized in that the water-absorbing resin subjected to the heat treatment is stirred and cooled down under a stream of air by using a stirring cooler including stirring boards for the purpose of sufficiently achieving the effect of improving physical properties by the surface crosslinking on an industrial scale (Document 5).<br>
Further, Document 6 discloses a method for (i) adding aqueous  liquid  containing a  surface  crosslinking  agent  to<br>
water-absorbing resin powder obtained through steps such as polymerization of monomers, heating, drying, cooling, and crushing, and (ii) heating and drying the mixture, so as to surface crosslink the water-absorbing resin powder.<br>
Moreover, Document 7 discloses a method for treating with heat more than once the water-absorbing resin subjected to the surface treatment, for the purpose of delaying free water absorption. Moreover, Document 8 discloses that an expansion strength under pressure can be improved by repeating twice a step of adding surface treatment agent-containing liquid to the water-absorbing resin and heating this mixture.

As disclosed in Documents 4 and 5, conventionally, in the case of improving the functionality of the water-absorbing resin by the surface treatment, it is believed that it is effective to use a stirrer such as a stirring dryer or stirring cooler including stirring boards in light of improvement of miscibility. Meanwhile, in the case of using<br>
the stirrer as disclosed in the techniques of Documents 4 and 5, there is still such a problem that a large amount of fine powder is generated during the surface crosslinking treatment. If a large amount of fine powder is generated, a surface crosslinked layer tends to be destroyed. Thus, a large amount of fine power adversely affects the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin.<br>
The above problem may be caused because the shape of the stirring board is not appropriate for stirring a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. That is, in conventional technologies, the stirring board is used to improve the miscibility, arid the shape thereof is determined to improve the miscibility. Therefore, conventionally, there is no idea of using the stirring board to suppress the generation of the fine powder. That is, the shape of the stirring board is not determined to suppress the generation of the fine powder.<br>
For    example,     since    the    difference    between    the<br>
maximum thickness and minimum thickness of the stirring<br>
board  used  in  conventional techniques is large,  too much<br>
pressure    is    applied    to    the    powder    of   the    hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked polymer when the stirring board breaks into the<br>
powder, and the powder is compressed.     Thus, the density of<br>
the powder is increased, and the water-absorbing resin is<br>
damaged    mechanically    during    the    surface    crosslinking<br>
treatment.     As  a  result,  the  amount  of fine  powder  may<br>
increase.<br>
Moreover,    in   addition   to   the   improvement   of   the functions of the water-absorbing resin, there is a problem of how  to  effectively massproduce  the  water-absorbing  resin without   deteriorating  its  performances  to   keep  up  with  a growing demand for the water-absorbing resin in recent years. As disclosed in Documents 7 and 8, a method for improving the functionality by the surface treatment has already been suggested.       However,   the   deterioration   of   the   physical properties of the water-absorbing resin due to damage, etc. to the   water-absorbing   resin   by   the   heat   treatment   device including stirring blades has not been discussed in light of the    surface    treatment,    although    this    deterioration    is problematic   when    scaling   up   the   manufacture    of   the water-absorbing resin.<br>
Here, as a method for increasing the amount of production of the water-absorbing resin, it may be possible to use a large heat treatment device that is simply a larger version of an existing heat treatment device. However, in the large heat treatment device, the heat transfer area with respect to the effective volume is small. Therefore, in order to keep the temperature of the water-absorbing resin within a certain range and cause a desired surface crosslinking reaction, it is necessary to extend a time for the water-absorbing resin to stay in the above device. Then, if a<br>
time for stirring the water-absorbing resin by the  stirring board  during  the  surface  crosslinking treatment becomes long,  the  water-absorbing resin  is damaged mechanically. As a result, the amount of fine powder increases, and the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin deteriorate. That is, conventionally, there is no finding regarding what stirrer can suppress the generation of the fine powder and manufacture high-performance water-absorbing resin.<br>
In order to avoid (i) the generation of the fine powder which genera Lion is caused due Lo the increase in size of a device and (ii) the deterioration of the physical properties due to the generation of the fine powder, it may be possible to simply arrange a plurality of small heat treatment devices in parallel. However, since the numbers of accessory devices and pipings provided in front of and behind each heal: treatment device increase by arranging a plurality of heat treatment devices, the cost increases. Moreover, since it is necessary to control a plurality of heat treatment devices, the efficiency deteriorates.<br>
Here, there is a demand for a method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin which method can effectively massproduce the water-absorbing resin on an industrial scale and can maintain the performances of the water-absorbing resin.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present invention was  made to  solve  the  above problems.     In order to manufacture water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small and which has excellent   physical   properties,    an   object   of   the   present invention is to provide (i) a method for manufacturing the water-absorbing  resin,   the   method   including  a   modifying step and/or a cooling step which are carried out by using a stirrer having a specific configuration, and (ii) a method for surface   crosslinking   the   water-absorbing   resin   in   which method a processing time of a heat treatment is shortened when scaling up manufacturing of the water-absorbing resin. The present inventors have focused on and diligently studied the configuration of a stirrer used for the surface crosslinking treatment of the water-absorbing resin.    As a result, it is found that by (i) carrying out the modifying step and/or   the   cooling   step   by  using   the   stirrer   having   the specific configuration and (ii) when surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin,  carrying out,  as  separate   steps,  a stirring/drying step and a surface crosslinking step which are included in the modifying step, it is possible to optimize stirring conditions and temperature conditions for each step. As a result, it is found that the processing time of the heat treatment     can     be     shortened,     the     damage     to     the water-absorbing     resin      can      be      reduced,      and      the<br>
water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small, can be manufactured without decreasing the amount of production. Thus, the present invention has been completed.<br>
That is, a method for manufacturing water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes: a modifying step that is a step of heating a mixture of a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer   containing   a   carboxyl   group    and    an    aqueous solution containing a surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group,   so   as   to   crosslink   a   surface   of   the   hydrophilic crosslinked polymer; and a cooling step of cooling down the hydrophilic crosslinked  polymer thus  surface  crosslinked, and in this method, (i) the modifying step and/or the cooling step are/is carried out by using stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of stirring boards, and (ii) where a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of   the   rotation   axis   is   an   x   direction,   and   a   direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction  is  a z direction,   a   ratio   of  a   maximum   thickness   of  the   stirring board to a minimum thickness of the stirring board is 5 or less in a cross section taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means.<br>
According to the above configuration, since the ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness is 5 or less,  thai is,  a  plurality of stirring boards each of whose thickness is comparatively uniform are used, it is possible to significantly  reduce  a  pressure  applied  to  the  hydrophilic crosslmked polymer per cross-sectional area of the stirring board, and also possible to reduce friction generated between the stirring board and the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. Therefore,   it   is   possible   to   uniformly   stir   the   hydrophilic crosslinked  polymer  while  reducing  mechanical  damage   to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer.     On this account, it is possible   to   manufacture   the   water-absorbing   resin,   the amount of fine powder of which is small.<br>
Moreover, a method for manufacturing water absorbing resin of the present invention includes: a modifying step that is a step of heating a mixture of a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing a carboxyl group and an aqueous solution containing a surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink a surface of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer; and a cooling step of cooling down the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer thus surface crosslinked, and in this method, (I) the modifying step and/or the cooling step are/is carried out by using stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of<br>
stirring  boards   having   scraping  blades,   and   (II)   where   a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is an x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction is a z direction, (i) a cross-sectional area of the scraping blade in a cross section taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means is 10% or more but less than 50% of an area in the y-z plane between one stirring board from which the scraping blade projects and another stirring board provided so as to face the above one stirring board, and (ii) a length of the scraping blade in the y direction in the cross section taken along the y-z plane is 50% or more of a distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board.<br>
In the case of using a stirring dryer or stirring cooler<br>
used     in     conventional     technologies,      the     hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked polymer is compressed excessively as the stirring<br>
of   the    hydrophilic    crosslinked    polymer   continues,    the<br>
hydrophilic crosslinked polymer is damaged mechanically,<br>
and the fine powder is generated.     However, according to the<br>
above   configuration,   since   the   cross-sectional   area   and<br>
length of the scraping blade provided on the stirring board<br>
are   adjusted   to   be   in   the   above   ranges,   the   hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked polymer is not compressed excessively and can<br>
be stirred in a floating state, and the aggregate and compression of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer can be<br>
prevented. Therefore, it is possible to uniformly stir the mixture of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and the aqueous solution, and also possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small. Moreover, since the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer can be less compressed, and the degree of compression of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer can be lowered, it is possible to stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer with a low stirring power, and also possible to improve producibility.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that a method for surface<br>
crosslinking water-absorbing resin of the present invention<br>
include   the   steps   of:   (1)   mixing  a  solution   containing  a<br>
surface   crosslinking   agent   with   a   water-absorbing   resin<br>
precursor,  so as to obtain a wet mixture;  (2)  stirring and<br>
drying the wet mixture, so as to obtain a dried particulate<br>
composition containing the surface crosslinking agent; and<br>
(3)   carrying  out a  heat  treatment of the  dried  particulate<br>
composition, so as to cause a surface crosslinking reaction of<br>
the dried particulate composition, and in this method,  80<br>
weight   %   or   more   of  the   dried   particulate   composition<br>
obtained in the step (2) be particles which pass through a<br>
sieve having a mesh size of 10 mm, each of the steps (2) and (3) he carried out by using fit least one processing device, and the processing device used for the step (2) and the processing device used for the step (3) be serially connected to each other.<br>
According to the above configuration, by stirring and drying the wet  mixture  so  that  the  aggregate  of particles which occurs when processing the wet mixture is suppressed, it   is   possible   to   obtain   the   dried   particulate   composition which is powder having high flowability.     Therefore, in the step   of   causing   the   surface   crosslinking   reaction,   it   is possible to carry out a desired surface crosslinking with weak stirring or a device having no stirring blade.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Tin-   following   will   explain   one   embodiment   of   the present   invention.      However,   the   present   invention   is   not limited to this.<br>
[Aspect Of Stirrer (Stirring Means) Used In Modifying Step   And/or   Cooling   Step   In   Method   For   Manufacturing Water-absorbing Resin Of Present Invention] <thickness of stirring board><br>
In   one   embodiment,   a   method   for   manufacturing<br>
water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes: a<br>
modifying   step   that   is   a   step   of heating  a   mixture   of a<br>
hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing a carboxyl group<br>
and an aqueous solution containing a surface crosslinking<br>
agent containing two or more functional groups which react<br>
with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink a surface of the<br>
hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer;   and   a   cooling   step   of<br>
cooling   down   the   hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer   thus<br>
surface crosslinked,  and in this method,  (A) the modifying<br>
step  and/or  the  cooling  step  are/is  carried  out  by  using<br>
stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of<br>
stirring   boards,   and   (B)   where   a   direction   parallel   to   a<br><br>
longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is an x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction is a z direction, a ratio of a maximum thickness of the stirring board to a minimum thickness of the stirring board is 5 or less in a cross section taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means.<br>
In the present embodiment, the modifying step and/or the cooling step are/is carried out by using the stirring means having the stirring board whose thickness is within a predetermined range.<br>
Figure 1 is a cross-sectional diagram showing one example of a configuration of a stirrer (stirring means) 100 used in the present embodiment. Moreover, in the present specification, the term "stirring board" is synonymous with the term "stirring blade".<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the stirrer 100 includes a driving device 10, a horizontal drum 20, a raw material supply opening 30, heat medium/cooling medium input ports 40 and 40', heat medium/cooling medium outlet ports 45 and 45', a water-absorbing resin discharge opening 50, a carrier gas installation port 81, and an exhaust port 85. Inside the horizontal drum 20, stirring boards 80 are provided on a rotation axis 70 which rotates by the driving device 10, and<br><br>
the stirring board 80 has a scraping blade 90.<br>
In Figure 1, the stirring board 80 has the scraping blade 90. However, in the present embodiment, the stirring board 80 may or may not have the scraping blade 90. Details of the scraping blade will be described later.<br>
The shape of the stirring board 80 is not especially limited as long as the stirring board 80 can stir the above mixture supplied from the raw material supply opening 30 to<br>
the horizontal drum 20.  • For eal^nple, 'the  shape of the<br>
Tfrf-'    ^   i stirring board 80 may be a disc shjape gr a disc shape a part<br>
of which is lacking.     Moreover, the  shape of the  stirring<br>
board 80 may be a fan shape that is a disc shape a part of<br>
which is lacking.     However, in light of the reduction in the<br>
density of powder in the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, the<br>
shape of the stirring board 80 is preferably a disc shape, and<br>
especially   preferably   a  flat  disc   shape.      The   term   "disc<br>
shape" means that the shape of a cross section taken along<br>
an x-z plane of the stirring board is a circle, however this<br>
circle does not have to be a complete circle.     The term "flat<br>
disc shape" means that the surface of the  stirring board<br>
having  the  disc  shape  is  flat.      Moreover,   the  term  "disc<br>
shape a part of which is lacking" means that the shape of the<br>
cross section taken along the x-z plane of the stirring board<br>
is a circle but this circle is partially lacking.    This lacking<br>
portion is not especially limited, and may be, for example, an<br><br>
outer circumference of the disc shape or the inside of the disc shape. A case where the inside of the disc shape is lacking includes a case where, for example, the stirring board has a hole.<br>
In the case of using the stirring board having the fan shape, the inner angle of the fan is preferably from 15 degrees to 75 degrees, and more preferably from 30 degrees to 60 degrees. When the inner angle of the fan is smaller than 15 degrees and when it is larger than 75 degrees, an effect of suppressing the generation of the fine powder deteriorates.<br>
Figure 2(A) is a cross-sectional diagram taken along a y-z plane of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 including stirring boards 80a each having a wedge shape. Figure 2(B) is a cross-sectional diagram taken along an x-z plane of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 including stirring boards 80a each having a flat disc shape (fan shape).<br>
Moreover, Figure 3(A) is a cross-sectional diagram taken along a y-z plane of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 including stirring boards 80b each having a flat disc shape (fan shape). Figure 3(B) is a cross-sectional diagram taken along an x-z plane of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 including the stirring boards 80b each having a flat disc shape (fan shape). Note that Figures 2 and 3 show the stirring boards 80a and 80b, the rotation axis 70 and<br>
scraping blades 90a and 90b, and other members are not shown.<br>
In the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirrer   (stirring   means)    100,   a   ratio   of   the   maximum thickness of the stirring board 80 to the minimum thickness of the stirring board 80 needs to be 5 or less.     The ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness means a ratio of the maximum value of a thickness of the stirring board  in a cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means to the minimum value of the thickness of the stirring board in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the  stirring means,     For example, in Figure 2(A),  the above ratio can be expressed by Ti/T2, and in Figure 3(A), the above ratio can be expressed by TV/T2'.<br>
By setting the ratio of the maximum thickness to the<br>
minimum thickness to 5 or less, the thickness of the stirring<br>
board 80 becomes comparatively uniform.     Therefore, it is<br>
possible to drastically reduce a pressure per cross-sectional<br>
area  of  the   stirring   board   80   applied   to   the   hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked  polymer,  and also  possible to  reduce  friction<br>
generated between the stirring board 80 and the hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked  polymer.     On this  account,  it is  possible  to<br>
uniformly   stir   the   hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer  while<br>
reducing mechanical damage to the hydrophilic crosslinked<br>
polymer, and thereby possible to suppress the generation of<br>
the fine powdei . The ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness is not especially limited as long as it is 5 or less. However, the ratio is preferably 4 or less, more preferably 3 or less, further preferably 2 or less, and most preferably 1, Moreover, the stirring board 80 may have a rounded portion at its top so that it can smoothly cut into a powder layer.<br>
The stirring means using the stirring board has already been disclosed in, for example, Document 4. However, the thickness of the stirring board has not been considered at all, and the generation of the fine powder could not have been suppressed sufficiently. The present invention is completed as a result of study on an appropriate thickness of the stirring board for suppressing the amount of fine powder.<br>
The more the ratio of the maximum thickness of the stirring board 80 to the minimum thickness of the stirring board 80 approaches 1, the smaller the difference between the maximum thickness and the minimum thickness becomes. That is, since the gradient of the stirring board 80 in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 becomes gentle, the pressure and frictional force applied to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer during stirring become weaker. Thus, it is possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder. In contrast,<br>
when   the   ratio  of the   maximum  thickness  of the   stirring board 80 to the minimum thickness of the stirring board 80 is more than 5, the gradient of the stirring board 80 becomes steep.     Thus, the pressure and frictional force applied to the hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer   during   stirring   become strong.     As a result, the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer is compressed,   the   density   of   powder   increases,   and   the hydrophilic    crosslinked    polymer    is    easily    destroyed. Therefore, it is difficult to suppress the generation of the fine powder.<br>
In order to sufficiently stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and efficiently carry out the surface crosslinking, a plurality of the stirring boards 80 are provided.     Note that the number of the stirring boards 80 is not especially limited as long as it is plural, and the number of the stirring boards 80 may be set properly depending on the size of the stirrer (stirring means) 100 and a manufacturing scale.     Regarding all the stirring boards, the ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness needs to be 5 or less.     As long as this ratio is 5 or less regarding all the stirring boards, the thicknesses of these stirring boards may be the same as each other or may be different from each other.<br>
Moreover, the size of the stirring board 80 is not especially limited as long as the ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness is 5 or less, and the size<br>
of the stirring board 80 may be set properly depending on the size of the stirrer (stirring means) 100. Moreover, the diameter of the stirring board is preferably 9.0 cm or more, more preferably 40 cm or more, and especially preferably 60 cm or more.<br><scraping blade><br>
In   one   embodiment,   a   method   for   manufacturing water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes: a modifying  step  that  is  a  step  of heating  a  mixture  of a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing a carboxyl group and an aqueous solution containing a surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink a surface of the hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer;   and   a   cooling   step   of cooling   down   the   hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer   thus surface crosslinked, and in this method, (A) the modifying step and/or the cooling  step are/is  carried  out  by using stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of stirring  boards  having  scraping  blades,   and   (B)   where   a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is an x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction is a z direction, (i) a cross-sectional area of the scraping blade in a cross section<br>
taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means is 10% or more but less than 50% of an area in the y-z plane between one stirring board from which the scraping blade projects and another stirring board provided so as to face the above one stirring board, and (ii) a length of the scraping blade in the y direction in the cross section taken along the y-z plane is 50% or more of a distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board.<br>
The scraping blade is a plate-like member fixed to the stirring board, and the material thereof is not especially limited. Although the stirring means using the scraping blade has already been disclosed in, for example, Document 4, the shape of the scraping blade for suppressing the generation of the fine powder has not yet been considered in detail. P'or example, Document 4 discloses only the length of the scraping blade projecting from the stirring board.<br>
The present inventor has achieved the present in veil I ion by finding that since, by adjusting the arc-a and length of the scraping blade in an appropriate range, it is possible to stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer in a floating state without excessively compressing the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and also possible to prevent the aggregate and compression of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, it is possible to stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer uniformly and suppress the generation of the fine<br>
powder.<br>
The scraping blade is provided on the stirring board so as to project from the stirring board in the y-z plane.     The above'   expression   "project   from   the   stirring  board"   means that, in other words, the scraping blade is provided so as to cross the stirring board  in  the y-z plane.     For example,  in the   y-z   plane   of  Figure   2(A),   the   scraping   blade   QOa   is provided on the stirring board 80a so as to project from the stirring board 80a and cross the stirring board 80a at a right angle.     Moreover, for example, in the y-z plane of Figure 3(A), the scraping blade 90b is provided so as to project from the stirring board 80b and cross the stirring board 80b at a right angle.     Note that Figures 2(A) and 3(A) are just examples, and the angle of crossing is not limited to the right angle.<br>
As long as the scraping blade projects from the stirring board in the y-z plane, it may be attached to the stirring board as a separate member. That is, the scraping blade may be configured as a member separated from the stirring board, and may be connected to the stirring board. Moreover, as long as the functions of the scraping blade are not hindered, the scraping blade may be formed integrally with the stirring board.<br>
The shape of the scraping blade is not especially limited as long as the area and length of the scraping blade are in the above ranges. Moreover, the number of the<br>
scraping blades is not especially limited as long as it is at least 1.<br>
The above expression "another stirring board provided so as to face the above one stirring board" means another stirring  board  adjacent  in  the  y  direction  to   one   stirring board   from  which  the  scraping  blade  projects.     Moreover, the  above  expression  "area  in  the y-z plane  between  one stirring board  from which the  scraping blade projects and another stirring board provided so as to face the above one stirring board" (area between the stirring boards) means an area of a region which is sandwiched by these stirring boards in the y x plane.    For example, in Figure 2(A), this area is an area obtained by Ta x T4, and in Figure 3(A), this area is an area obtained by Ta' x T4r.<br>
The    cross-sectional    area    of    the    scraping    blade<br>
occupies 10% or more but less than 50% of the area between<br>
the stirring boards, and it is preferably 10% or more but less<br>
than 40%, further preferably 15% or more but less than 40%,<br>
and most preferably 20% or more but less than 40%.     When<br>
the cross-sectional area  of the  scraping blade is less than<br>
10% of the area between the stirring boards, the efficiency of<br>
stirring   and   the   delivery   of powder   deteriorate,   and   it   is<br>
impossible   to   improve   the   aggregate   of   the   hydrophilic<br>
crosslinked  polymer.     Therefore,  it is difficult to  suppress<br>
the   generation   of  the   fine   powder.      Moreover,   it   is   not.<br>
preferable that the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade be more than 50% of the area between the stirring boards. This is because, in this case, the scraping blade is too large, and therefore stirring power needs to be high. On this account, the stirring speed decreases, the stirring becomes nonuniform, and a layer of the hydrophilic crosslinkcd polymer becomes nonuniform.<br>
Note that the scraping blade needs only to project from<br>
one stirring board, and does not have to project from a<br>
plurality of stirring boards. However, for example, as shown<br>
in Figure 3(A), it is preferable that (i) the scraping blade<br>
project from a plurality of stirring boards, and (ii) in the cross<br>
section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means,<br>
adjacent scraping blades be provided alternately while<br>
sandwiching the rotation axis or be provided in parallel with<br>
each other. The cross-sectional area of the scraping blade<br>
is, for example, an area of the scraping blade in the area<br>
between the stirring boards.	Examples of the<br>
cross-sectional area of the scraping blade are an area expressed by (Te * Ts) * 2 * 4 in Figure 2(A), and an area expressed by Te' x Ts' in Figure 3(A).<br>
Thus, the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade can be made larger relative to the area between the stirring boards, and the length of the scraping blade can be increased. Moreover, the scraping blade is strongly fixed to the stirring<br>
board. Further, an arbitrary angle setting can be carried out to improve the proceeding of the powder layer. Therefore, the efficiency of stirring and the delivery of powder can be improved, and the surface crosslinking can be carried out uniformly.<br>
The above expression "the scraping blade projects from a plurality of stirring boards" is not limited to a case shown in Figure 3(A) where the scraping blade projects from two stirring boards, and includes a case where the scraping blade projects from three or more stirring boards. The above expression "adjacent scraping blades" means one scraping blade and another scraping blade which are adjacent to each other in the y direction in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means.<br>
Moreover, the above expression "in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means, adjacent scraping blades be provided alternately while sandwiching the rotation axis" means that, in the y-z plane, the adjacent scraping blades are located so as to be opposite to each other when viewed from the z direction while sandwiching the rotation axis.<br>
Further, the above expression "in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means, adjacent scraping blades be provided in parallel with each other" means that, in the y-z plane, two scraping blades are<br>
provided   so   as   to   sandwich   the   rotation   axis,   and   each scraping blade has a gradient angle.<br>
Moreover, in the x-y plane and/or the x-z plane and/or the  y-z  plane,  the  scraping  blade  can  be  attached  to  the stirring board so as to be inclined at an arbitrary angle.     The above  "gradient angle"  means  the  above  "arbitrary  angle", and is preferably 0 degree or more but less than 45 degrees, more preferably 0.5 degree or more but less than 10 degrees, further preferably 1 degree or more but less than 7 degrees, and   most   preferably  3   degrees  or  more  but  less  than   7 degrees.<br>
The length of the scraping blade in the y direction in<br>
the cross section taken along the y-z plane occupies 50% or<br>
more of the distance in the y-z plane between the above one<br>
stirring    board    and    the    above    another    stirring    board.<br>
Moreover, the above length occupies preferably 80% or more,<br>
and most preferably 100%.     When the length of the scraping<br>
blade is less than 50% of the distance between the stirring<br>
boards, it is impossible to obtain sufficient power for stirring<br>
the mixture of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and the<br>
aqueous  solution.     Therefore,  the  surface  of the  resin  is<br>
crosslinked nonuniformly, so that the above configuration is<br>
not suitable as a stirrer for the water-absorbing resin.<br>
Meanwhile,   the   upper   limit   of   the   length   of   the scraping blade in the y direction is not especially limited, and<br>
may be more than 100% of the distance between the stirring boards as long as the efficiency of stirring and the delivery of powder do not deteriorate.<br>
The above expression "the length of the scraping blade in the y direction" means, for example, a. length expressed by Ts (Ts - 2 x 2) in Figure 2(A), and a length expressed by T5' in Figure 3(A). Moreover, the above expression "a distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board" means a length expressed by, for example, ?4 in Figure 2(A), or a length expressed by TV in Kitfurc 3(A).<br>
Moreover, the "distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board" is, on an industrial scale, preferably from 5 cm to 40 cm, more preferably from 10 cm to 40 cm, further preferably from 10 cm to 30 cm, and especially preferably from 15 cm to 25 cm.<br>
In the present embodiment, by setting the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade in the above range and also setting the length of the scraping blade in the y direction in the above range, it is possible to stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer in a floating state without excessively compressing the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, prevent the aggregate and compression of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, and decrease the density of powder.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to uniformly stir the mixture of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and the aqueous solution and also possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder.<br>
Moreover,    in    one    embodiment    of    a    method    for manufacturing    water-absorbing    resin     of    the     present invention, it is preferable that (i) the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade be set in the above range, (ii) the length of the scraping blade in the y direction be set in the above range, and (iii) in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means, the ratio of the maximum thickness of the stirring board to the minimum thickness of the stirring board be set to 5 or less.    Thus, since the shape of the scraping blade is set in an appropriate range, and the thickness of the stirring board is set in an appropriate range, it is possible to obtain a high effect of suppressing the generation of the fine powder.<br><aspect of stirring board><br>
It is preferable that the stirring board also act as heat transferring means. As above, the surface crosslinking of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer is carried out by heating the mixture of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing the carboxyl group and the aqueous solution containing the surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group.<br>
In this case, heating means is not especially limited as long as it can uniformly heat the above mixture. For example, it is possible to use, as heating means, vapor, thermal oil, electric energy, warm air, etc., as long as these can heat the above mixture uniformly.<br>
However, as above, in the present invention, since the thickness of the stirring board is controlled and the stirring can be carried out uniformly, it is preferable that the stirring board also act as heat transferring means. Thus, it is possible to heat the above mixture uniformly, and also possible' to proceed with a surface crosslinking reaction uniformly.<br>
When   the    stirring   board   also   acts   as   the    heat transferring means, for example, (i) a flow path in which the heat medium  can  circulate is provided inside  the  stirring board or on the surface of the stirring board, (ii) the heat medium is supplied to the flow path, (iii) the surface of the stirring board is utilized as a heat transferring surface, and (iv) the temperature of this surface is set to a temperature necessary for the surface crosslinking.     The temperature of the   heat   medium   may   be   adjusted   properly   by   using   a conventionally known temperature control device, so as to be ;i   U'tnprralurc   necessary  for  the  surface  crosslinking.      In order to efficiently utilize the heat medium, the flow path may be provided in or on the rotation axis, and the heat medium<br>
may circulate in each stirring board. Moreover, similarly, the flow path may be provided in or on the scraping blade, and the heat medium may be supplied to the flow path of the scraping blade.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the stirring board also act as cooling means.     In order to immediately terminate the surface crosslinking after a desired surface crosslinking is completed,   it   is   preferable   to   quickly   and   uniformly   cool down  the mixture.     In  this case,  the cooling means is not especially limited as long as it can uniformly cool down the mixture.     For example, it is possible to use' a conventionally known cooling device.     The cooling medium is not especially limited as long as it can uniformly cool down the mixture, and may be water, cold water, wind, ventilation, air flow, etc. However, as above, in the present invention, since the thickness of the stirring board is controlled and the stirring can be carried out uniformly, it is preferable that the stirring board also act as the cooling means.     Thus, it is possible to uniformly   cool   down   the   mixture,   and   also   possible   to uniformly stop the surface crosslinking reaction.<br>
For example, when the stirring board also acts as the cooling means, (i) a flow path in which the cooling medium such as water can circulate is provided inside the stirring board or on the surface of the stirring board, (ii) the cooling medium is supplied to the flow path, (iii) the surface of the<br>
stirring   board   is   utilized   as   a   cooling   surface,   (iv)   the temperature of this surface is set to a temperature necessary for terminating the surface crosslinking.     The temperature of the cooling medium may be adjusted properly by using a conventionally known temperature control device, so as to be a    temperature    necessary    for    terminating    the    surface crosslinking.       In   order   to   efficiently   utilize   the   cooling medium, the flow path may be provided in or on the rotation axis, and the cooling medium may circulate in each stirring board.     Moreover, similarly, the flow path may be provided in or on the scraping blade, and the cooling medium may be supplied to the flow path of the scraping blade. [Manufacture of Water-absorbing Resin] A method for manufacturing water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes (i) a step (hereinafter referred to as "water-absorbing resin precursor manufacturing step") of manufacturing a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer (In the present specification,  this polymer may be  referred  to  as "water-absorbing  resin  precursor".)   containing  a  carboxyl group, (ii) a step (1) (hereinafter referred to as "wet mixture preparing step") of mixing (a) the above polymer and (b) an aqueous    solution    (hereinafter    referred    to    as    "aqueous solution")     containing    the     surface     crosslinking     agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group, so as to obtain a wet mixture, (iii) a step<br>
(2)    (hereinafter   referred   to   as   "stirring/drying   step")   of stirring and drying the wet mixture so as to obtain a dried participate composition containing the surface crosslinking agent,   (iv)   a   step   (3)   (hereinafter  referred  to   as  "surface crosslinking     step")     of     heating     the     dried     particulate composition so as to cause the surface crosslinking reaction, and   (v)   "a   cooling  step"   of cooling  down   the   hydrophilic crosslinked polymer thus surface crosslinked.<br>
Here,   the  "surface  crosslinking method"  used   in  the present specification is a method including the steps (1), (2) and  (3).     Moreover,  the modifying step is a step of heating the     mixture     of    the     hydrophilic     crosslinked     polymer containing   the   carboxyl   group   and   the   aqueous   solution containing the surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink the surface of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer.     The modifying step includes the steps (2) and (3). In  reference  to  Figures   1   and   5,   the  following  will explain the modifying step and cooling step in the method for manufacturing   the   water-absorbing   resin   of  the   present invention,     and     then    explain     the     entire     method    for manufacturing   the   water-absorbing   resin   of   the   present invention.<br>
(1. Modifying Step)<br>
The   following  will   explain   one   embodiment   of  the<br>
modifying step in  reference to Figure  1.     That is, after the wet mixture preparing step, the mixture, supplied from the raw   material   supply   opening   30,   of   (a)   the   hydrophilic crosslinked polymer and (b) the aqueous solution containing the   surface   crosslinking   agent   containing   two   or   more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group floats in the stirrer (stirring means) 100 by (i) the rotation of the stirring   board   80   which   rotates   in   accordance   with   the rotation of the driving device 10 and (ii) the rotation of the scraping blade 90 provided on the stirring board 80, and the mixture is heated and dried by contacting with the stirring board 80 which contains the heat medium (stirring/drying step).<br>
Although the mixture is wet at first, it is stirred and heated by the stirring board 80, and the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer is surface crosslinked (surface crosslinking step). The mixture moves in the drum 20 from the raw material supply opening 30 to the discharge opening 50. By carrier gas, such as a small amount of air or inactive gas, supplied from the carrier gas installation port 81, vapor generated during the heating flows above the top surface of a heat ing/si irring layer and is discharged from the exhaust port 85. The mixture supplied continuously is mixed and heated by the rotation of the stirring board 80. Then, the mixture moves toward the discharge opening 50 and is<br>
discharged therefrom.<br>
In   Figure   1,   the   number   of the   rotation   axes   70 attached to  the stirrer (stirring means)  is   1,  however the number of the rotation axes 70 is not especially limited, and it is preferable that the number of the rotation axes 70 be plural in light of the efficiency of stirring with respect to the effective  volume.      For  example,   when  a  plurality  of the rotation axes 70 are attached to the stirrer (stirring means), it is preferable that these rotation axes 70 be attached in parallel in the x-y plane.    When there are a plurality of the rotation   axes   70,   a   plurality   of  the   stirring   boards   80 provided on different rotation axes 70 may overlap each other and engage with each other, or may be independent from each other and not engage with each other.<br>
As   shown   in   Figure    1,   the   heat   medium/cooling<br>
medium input port 40 is provided at one end of the hollow<br>
rotation   axis   70,   and   the   heat  medium/cooling  medium<br>
outlet  port  45  is  provided  at  another  end  of the  hollow<br>
rotation axis 70.     Since the heat medium moves from the<br>
heat  medium/cooling medium  input port  40  through  the<br>
hollow   of  the   rotation   axis   to   the   heat   medium/cooling<br>
medium outlet port 45 and also flows into the stirring board<br>
80, the surface of the stirring board 80 is also heated by the<br>
heat medium,     Note that the flow of the heat medium or the<br>
cooling medium may be set to a counter flow or a parallel flow<br>
100, it is preferable that, for example, the amount of the mixture filled per internal volume be preferably from 150 kg/m3 to 700 kg/m3, and especially preferably from 200 kg/m3 to 600 kg/m3.<br>
The water-absorbing resin can be obtained by stirring<br>
and heating the above mixture and surface crosslinking the<br>
hydrophilic crosslinked polymer.	In the present<br>
specification, the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer which has been subjected to the surface crosslinking in the modifying step is termed the water-absorbing resin. Since the water-absorbing resin shrinks by drying, a filling rate in the stirrer changes chronologically. In the case of less than 150 kg/m3, the generation of powder may occur. Meanwhile, in the case of more than 700 kg/m3, the surface crosslinking may be insufficient.<br>
In   the   present   embodiment,   a   time   for   mixing   the<br>
mixture, that is, a staying time of the mixture in the device<br>
can   be  determined  freely depending on  the  number of the<br>
rotation   axes   70,   whether   the   stirring  board   80   has   the<br>
scraping blade 90, whether the stirring board 80 has a lacked<br>
portion, the internal volume of the stirrer (stirring means)<br>
100,  etc.,  however it   is generally from   10  minutes to   120<br>
minutes,   and   preferably  from  20  minutes  to  90  minutes.<br>
This staying time can be controlled by adjusting the mount of<br>
a raw material supplied.<br>
Moreover, the number of rotations of the stirring board 80 is not especially limited, but is preferably from 2 rpm to 40 rpm, and more preferably from 5 rpm to 30 rpm. The number of rotations of the stirring board 80 ean be determined properly depending on the staying time and the presence or absence of the generation of the aggregate.<br>
Moreover, the following will explain another embodiment of the modifying step in reference to Figure 5. That is, in the present embodiment, a water-absorbing resin manufacturing device includes, as shown in Figure 5, a first processing device 2 and a second processing device 3. Each of the first processing device 2 and the second processing device 3 includes a driving device 10, a horizontal drum 20, a raw material supply opening 30, heat medium input ports 40 and 40', heat medium outlet ports 45 and 45', a water-absorbing resin discharge opening 50, a carrier gas installation port 81, and an exhaust port 85 (see Figure 5).<br>
Note that the water-absorbing resin discharge opening of the first processing device 2 is connected to the raw material supply opening of the second processing device 3.<br>
Specific operations of a water-absorbing resin manufacturing device shown in Figure 5 are as follows. A wet mixture (raw material) of (a) the water-absorbing resin precursor and (b) a solution containing the surface crosslinking agent which mixture is supplied from the raw<br>
material supply opening 30 of the first processing device 2 floats by the rotation of the stirring board 80 which rotates in accordance with the rotation of the driving device 10, and the mixture is heated and dried by contacting with the stirring board  80 which contains the heat medium.     Although the wet mixture supplied from the raw material supply opening 30 is wet at first, it passes through the lacked portion (not shown) of the stirring board 80 in the drum 20, and moves to the second processing device 3.     By the carrier gas, such as a   small   amount  of air  or  inactive   gas,   supplied   from   the carrier gas installation port 81, the vapor generated during the     heating     flows     above      the     top     surface     of     the heating/stirring layer and  is  discharged  from  the  exhaust port 85.     Even if the wet mixture combines each other by the stirring   and   heating,   and   aggregates   are   generated,   the rota! ion   of  the   stirring  board   80   breaks   these   aggregates. Similarly, the mixture supplied continuously is mixed  and heated by the rotation of the stirring board 80, and moves to the second processing device 3.<br>
The dried particulate composition (powder) having moved lo the second processing device 3 moves in the same manner as the wet mixture moving in the first processing device 2. Then, finally, the water-absorbing resin having excellent physical properties is discharged from the water-absorbing resin discharge opening 50.<br>
In  the embodiment shown  in  Figure  5,   both  the first processing  device  2   and   the  second   processing  device  are biaxial trough stirring dryers.     As another embodiment, the first processing device 2 and the second processing device 3 may   be   conventionally   known   processing   devices   or   heat treatment   devices.       For   example,   as   such   a   processing device or a heat treatment device, it is possible to use a mixer which is generally used to mix powder.     When these devices need to carry out heating, it is possible to use a heat source. Examples  are  (i)  heating  by  causing pressurized  vapor or thermal oil to circulate in a heat medium circulating device and      (ii)      heating     by     heating     wire,     microwave,      or electromagnetic induction.     These heat medium circulating device and heating device can be attached to any locations, such as a jacket which  can  be attached to the  processing device and the inside of the stirring blade.     The type of the heat   source,   the   spec   of  a   heat   source   device,   the   set temperature  of the  heat  source,   and  the  amount  of heat supplied   from   the   heat  source   per  unit  time   can   be   set properly depending on the type of the surface crosslinking ;ip,ent used and the type of the heat treatment device used.<br>
When roughly classifying mixers, which are generally used for powder, by mechanical actions applied to the powder, there   are   (i)   a   mixer   in   which   a  container   itself  rotates, vibrates, and shakes, such as a container rotating type mixer<br>
and a built-in stirring blade/container rotating type mixer, (ii) a mixer in which a container is fixed and a stirring blade, etc. carries out stirring,  such as a horizontal rotation axis mechanical stirring type mixer and a vertical rotation axis mechanical stirring type mixer, (iii) a mixer which carries out stirring by air or gas, such as a flow stirring type mixer, (iv) a mixer which  uses gravity flow and  flow paths  divided  by branching plates or tubes.     Other examples of the mixer are a    high-speed    shearing    mixer    and    an    impact    mixer. Regarding the  types of the mixers in the above respective classifications, examples of the container rotating type mixer are a horizontal cylinder type mixer, a gradient cylinder type mixer,   a   V-type   mixer,   a   double   cone   type   mixer,   and   a continuous V-type  mixer,  examples  of the  built-in  stirring blade/container rotating type mixer are a horizontal cylinder type mixer,  a  gradient  cylinder type  mixer,  a V-type  mixer, and a double cone type mixer, examples of the horizontal rotation   axis  mechanical   stirring  type   mixer  are   a   ribbon mixer, a screw mixer, a lot mixer, a pin mixer, arid a paddle mixer,   examples   of the   vertical   rotation   axis   mechanical stirring type mixer are a ribbon mixer, a screw mixer, a cone screw mixer, a high-speed flow mixer, a rotating disc mixer, and a muller mixer, and examples of the flow stirring type mixer are a fluidized bed mixer, a circular flow mixer, and a jet pump mixer.<br>
As processing types of these devices, there are a batch type and a continuous processing type. However, the present invention is not especially limited. A mixer suitable lor thr object of the present invention can be used among commercially available mixers. In addition to the above examples, it is possible to use a mixer suitable for the object of the present invention.<br>
Moreover, in another embodiment, the first processing<br>
device 2 and the second processing device 3 may be different<br>
types of heat treatment devices or may be the same type of<br>
heat treatment devices.	Moreover, in yet another<br>
embodiment, in the case of a water-absorbing resin manufacturing device in which three or more heat treatment devices are connected to each other, any combination is possible (for example, some of these heat treatment devices are the same, but the rest is/are different).<br>
Since the first processing device 2 is used for the stirring/drying step, it is preferable that the first processing device 2 can carry out strong stirring. Among the above examples, a processing device having a stirring blade is preferable. Examples of such a processing device are a paddle dryer produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd., and a single paddle dryer produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd. Meanwhile, since the second processing device 3 is used for the surface crosslinking step, it is preferable that the stirring<br>
of the second processing device 3 carry out weaker stirring than the first processing device 2. Among the above examples, a heat treatment device having a stirring blade whose shape is such that shearing is not applied by stirring is preferable, and a heat treatment device having no stirring blade is also preferable. One example of the processing device having the stirring blade which does not cause damage by stirring is the multi-fin processor produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd., and one example of the processing device having no stirring blade is a towered dryer produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd.<br>
Further, although, in the water-absorbing resin manufacturing device (show in Figure 5) of the present embodiment, the second processing device 3 is the biaxial trough stirring dryer having the stirring boards 80, the second processing device 3 may be, as another embodiment, a dryer having no stirring board 80.<br>
The shape of the stirring blade of the water-absorbing resin manufacturing device shown in Figure 5 is not especially limited, and it is possible to use conventionally known stirring blade arbitrary. For example, the shape of the stirring blade may be the shape explained in the above <thickness of stirring board>. Moreover, as explained in the above <scraping blade>, the scraping blade 90 may be provided on the stirring board 80 to carry out stirring<br><br>
efficiently, or may not be provided.<br>
For the purpose of stirring powder more efficiently, in the first processing device 2, it is preferable that, for example, a plurality of axes be provided,  the stirring board have tin-scraping blade,  and the contact area of the stirring blade with the powder be large.     In the second processing device 3, it is preferable that, for example, a plate-like stirring blade be provided perpendicular to an axis so that shearing is not applied to the powder.    The number of the stirring blades per unit length of a stirring axis depends on the shape of the stirring   blade.      However,   the   larger   the   number   of  the stirring   blades   is,    the   more   the   efficiency   of   stirring increases.<br>
Note   that   in   the   present   specification,   the   term "stirring axis" is synonymous with the term "rotation axis".<br>
Moreover, the diameter of the stirring blade is not especially limited. However, the first processing device 2 needs to carry out stronger stirring than the second processing device 3. Therefore, if the number of rotations of the stirring blade of the first processing device 2 and the number of rotations of the stirring blade of the second processing device 3 are the same, it is preferable that the diameter of the stirring blade of the first processing device 2 be larger than that of the stirring blade of the second processing device 3.<br>
Moreover, if the diameter of the stirring blade of the first processing device 2 and the diameter of the stirring blade of the second processing device 3 are the same, it is preferable that the number of rotations of the stirring blade of the first processing device 2 be set to be larger than that of the stirring blade of the second processing device 3. Note that it is preferable that stirring conditions of the first processing device 2 and second processing device 3 satisfy the above conditions, however these stirring conditions are not especially limited to specific numerical values.<br>
Generally, in the first processing device 2, the number of rotations of the stirring blade is preferably in a range from 5 rpm to 300 rpm, more preferably in a range from 10 rpm to 300 rpm, and further preferably in a range from 20 rpm to 300 rpm. Moreover, a peripheral speed of the stirring blade is preferably from 0.15 m/s to 10 m/s, more preferably from 0.3 m/s to 10 m/s, and further preferably from 0.5 m/s to 10 m/s.<br>
In the second processing device 3, the number of rotations of the stirring blade is preferably from 0 rpm to 30 rpm, more preferably from 0 rpm to 20 rpm, and further preferably from 0 rpm to 10 rpm. Moreover, the peripheral speed of the stirring blade is preferably 2 m/s or less, more preferably 1 m/s or less, and further preferably 0.3 m/s or less.<br>
In   the   water-absorbing   resin   manufacturing   device shown :!; FMgure ~). n is preferable that, the discharge opening i: i \v M UM i d IN .         S i m e    1 h i s    COM figu r;i t in 11    docs    11 ol rcc[Uirc   iorcecl   stirring during discharging,   it  is  possible   to reduce      the      damage      to      the      water-absorbing      resin manufactured.       A   downwardly   inclined   portion   may   be provided inside the device, however such a configuration can be   realized   by   causing   the   device   itself  to   incline   when installing the  device.     The above downward  inclination   is usually a slight inclination.     Therefore, even if the device is caused  to incline when installing the device,  no problems occur   regarding   the   operations   of   the   device   and   the installation    of   the    device.        Note    that    the    downward inclination   is   not  a   must.      Especially,   a   heat  treatment device   having  a  delivering  blade  does  not  require   such  a downward inclination.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, in the water-absorbing<br>
resin manufacturing device of the present embodiment, the<br>
water-absorbing resin discharge opening 50 is provided<br>
downwardly.	According to this configuration, when<br>
conveying (he water -absorbing resin powder, the powder can be discharged downwardly only by gravity. Therefore, it is possible- to reduce the damage to the water-absorbing resin manufactured.<br>
Further,  in the water-absorbing resin manufacturing<br>
device shown in Figure 5, the first processing device 2 and the second processing device 3 are connected to each other in a hierarchical manner. Therefore, power is not especially required to convey the resin powder from the first processing device 2 to the second processing device 3.<br>
The carrier gas installation port 81 and the exhaust port 85 are formed for aeration by the carrier gas. The carrier gas is not especially limited, but examples thereof are vapor, air, and nitrogen. Moreover, the amount of carrier gas supplied is not especially limited, and may be determined properly. Further, the carrier gas is preferably heated so as not to lower the temperature inside the heat treatment device.<br>
According to the above configuration, the vapor (',
Moreover, the first processing device 2 and/or the second processing device 3 may include means for depressurizing or pressurizing the carrier gas. Further, the first processing device 2 and/or the second processing device 3 may include means for heating or cooling the carrier gas. Specifically, it is preferable that the first processing device 2 and/or the second processing device 3 can supply the carrier gas (for example, air) of around room temperature (for<br>
example, 0°C to 50°C) at substantially normal pressure (1,013 * 105 Pa (1 atmospheric pressure) ± 10%, preferably ifV'u, and more preferably ±1%).<br>
Note that in the present embodiment, the carrier gas installation port 81 and the exhaust port 85 are provided. As another embodiment, the carrier gas installation port 81 and the exhaust port 85 may not be provided.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the second processing device 3 can heat the water-absorbing resin powder discharged from the water-absorbing resin discharge opening 50 so that the temperature of the water-absorbing resin powder is from 180°C to 250°C, more preferably from 180°C to 230°C, and further preferably from 190°C to 210°C. Thus, the surface crosslinking step in the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin can be carried out efficiently.<br>
(2. Cooling Step)<br>
The hydrophilic crosslinked polymer (hereinafter referred to as "water-absorbing resin") surface crosslinked is subjected to the cooling step. Means for carrying out the cooling is not especially limited as long as it can cool down the mixture uniformly. For example, it is possible to use a conventionally known cooling device which can be connected to the stirrer (stirring means) 100. In the cooling step, the water-absorbing resin may or may not be stirred. However,<br>
in   light   of improvement   of the   efficiency   of cooling,   it  is preferable to stir the water-absorbing resin.     As described above, the cooling medium is not especially limited, and may be   water,   cold   water,   wind,   etc.      Moreover,   as   with   the stirrer    100,    it   is   preferable   to   use   a   device   which    is configured   so   that   the   cooling   medium   circulate   in   each stirring board 80.     Moreover, it is preferable that the surface (Tosslinked  water-absorbing resin be cooled  down  to  from about room temperature to 100°C.     A cooling device used in the cooling step is, for example,  a device connected to the stirrer   (stirring   means)    100   to   cool   down    the   surface crosslinked     water-absorbing     resin     after     the     surface crosslinking.<br>
Regarding a  timing of starting the  cooling  step,  the water-absorbing    resin    taken    out   of   the    stirrer    (stirring means)    100   starts   to   be   cooled   down   preferably   within    1 minute after the surface crosslinking, and more preferably within 30 seconds after the surface crosslinking.     Moreover, in light of the physical properties and the productivity, the temperature of the water-absorbing resin when starting the cooling    is    preferably    from    150°C    to    250°C,    and    the temperature of the water-absorbing resin after the cooling is preferably from 40°C to 100°C, more preferably 90°C or less, and especially preferably 70°C or less.<br>
In the cooling device, the water-absorbing resin has a<br>
temperature   gradient.      That   is,   the   temperature   of  the<br>
water-absorbing   resin   near   an   input   port   of  the   cooling<br>
device   is   a   surface   treatment   temperature   or  close   to   the<br>
surface treatment temperature, and the temperature of the<br>
water-absorbing  resin   near   an   outlet   port   of  the   cooling<br>
device   is   close   to   a   cooling   predetermined   temperature.<br>
Factors      of      determining      the      temperature       of      the<br>
water-absorbing resin at the outlet port are the temperature<br>
of the cooling medium, the heat transfer area of the cooling<br>
device, and the staying time in the cooling device, and these<br>
factors may be set properly so that a desired temperature of<br>
the water-absorbing resin at the outlet port can be obtained.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the cooling device be<br>
provided     so     that    the     water-absorbing    resin     is     fed<br>
continuously.	The     cooling     device     may     be     placed<br>
longitudinally (the water-absorbing resin is fed from top to bottom),   or  may  be  placed  laterally  (the  water-absorbing resin is fed laterally).     However, especially when the cooling device is provided laterally, it is preferable that the cooling device  not  be  placed  horizontally but be  placed  so  as  to incline   downwardly.      When   the   cooling  device   does   not incline, it is difficult to stably feed the water-absorbing resin due     to     the     powder     characteristics     of    the     heated water-absorbing resin.    Therefore, the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin may deteriorate, or may become<br>
unstable.	How     much     the     cooling     device     inclines<br>
downwardly is determined properly, but the downward inclination is preferably from 0.1 degree to 30 degrees, more preferably from 1 degree to 20 degrees, and further preferably from 3 degrees to 15 degrees.<br>
Further, in the modifying step, it is preferable to use the stirrer (stirring means) 100 which inclines downwardly. That is, in addition to the cooling device which inclines, it is preferable that the stirrer used for the modifying step that is before the cooling also incline. Thus, it is possible to carry out steps of obtaining preferable physical properties of the water-absorbing resin of the present invention. Since the stirrer (stirring means) 100 inclines downwardly, it is possible to improve piston flowability of the powder during continuous driving, and also possible to easily switch from one product to another.<br>
Piston flow (also referred to as "extrusion flow" or "plug flow") is defined as flow that, ideally, (i) has a velocity distribution which is uniform when viewed from a direction perpendicular to a direction of a material flowing from an input port of a device to an outlet port of the device and (n) moves in a flow direction without mixing or dispersing.<br>
By the improvement of the piston flowability of the water-absorbing resin powder, the staying time of the water-absorbing resin powder in the stirrer (stirring means)<br>
] 00   or   in    the   cooling   device   becomes   stable,   and   the modifying step and  the cooling step are carried out stably, and it is possible to stably manufacture the water-absorbing resin   powder   having   high   physical   properties.      Moreover, since a phenomenon that part of the water-absorbing resin powder stays m a device for a long time does not occur, the generation of powder of the water-absorbing resin  does not (•ccur.     Thus, ii is possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder.<br>
Moreover, by the improvement of the piston flowability, an essential field (zone) of an specific temperature range in a powder layer in the cooling device is formed more clearly for adding aqueous liquid (will be described later), and the addition of the aqueous liquid becomes easier.<br>
When the piston flowability is low, the staying time of the   water-absorbing   resin   powder   in   the   stirrer   (stirring means) 100 or in the cooling device varies largely.     Therefore, the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin become unstable, or products having low physical properties and a large amount of fine powder are manufactured.     Moreover, the  field  of the  specific  temperature  range  which  field  is essential   for   the   addition   of  the   aqueous   liquid   (will   be described later) is formed unclearly, and the addition of the aqueous liquid becomes difficult.<br>
Moreover, as disclosed in Document 5, it is preferable<br>
that the aqueous liquid  be added in the cooling step.     By adding, during the cooling after the modifying step, water or aqueous liquid containing water as the main component (In the  following explanation,  both  of water and  the aqueous liquid are collectively called the "aqueous liquid") to the field of 40°C to 100°C of the water-absorbing resin powder, it is possible to reduce the generation of the fine powder and dust. Moreover,   it   is   possible   to   obtain,   without   a   common granulating step, the water-absorbing resin powder which is equivalent to granulated water-absorbing resin powder.<br>
That is, it is possible to granulate the water-absorbing resin powder by adding the aqueous liquid. That is, it is possible to easily carry out granulation without using expensive equipment only for granulation. In this case, as conditions in the cooling step, usually, the temperature of the water-absorbing resin powder when starting the cooling step is more than 100°C, and the temperature of the water-absorbing resin powder after the cooling step is preferably 70°C or less.<br>
The addition of water to the water-absorbing resin usually causes heat generation, not heat absorption. By adding the aqueous liquid to the water-absorbing resin powder, an exothermic reaction by the heat of hydration occurs, and the water-absorbing resin generates heat. However, at the same time, the water-absorbing resin is<br>
forcibly cooled down in the cooling device. Therefore, the surface characteristics of the water-absorbing resin changes, and the water-absorbing re sin having more excellent physical properties can be obtained. Moreover, the generation of the fine powder may be suppressed, and the form of the resin powder may become satisfactory.<br>
Moreover, by the addition of the aqueous liquid, the flowability of the wet water-absorbing resin can be further improved, the amount of fine powder of the water-absorbing resin can be reduced, and the destruction of the surface of the water-absorbing resin in the following process can be prevented. Thus, by adding the aqueous liquid to the field of 40°C to 100°C powder, it is<br>
possible to obtain the (i) whose<br>
mass average particle diaxafixer itjrom 200 jim to 600 |jm, and preferably from 300 jim 10 ouy^juu, emu \ii) whose amount of fine powder having a diameter of 150 ^m or less is 5 mass %, preferably 3 mass %, and further preferably 1 mass % or less.<br>
The addition of the aqueous liquid to the cooling device is carried out with respect to the field of 40°C to 100°C of the water-absorbing resin powder, preferably 50°C to 90°C, and further preferably 60°C to 80°C. The term "field" used herein indicates a region (zone) having a specific temperature when the temperature of the water-absorbing resin<br>
continuously flowing changes (lowers) continuously.     When adding the aqueous liquid to the field of 40°C or less, (i) the water-absorbing resin may become agglomerates  (clumps), and these agglomerates may block the outlet port of the cooling device, (ii) the water-absorbing resin may adhere to the heat transferring surface of the cooling device, this may lower the efficiency of heat transfer, and the efficiency of cooling    may    deteriorate    practically,     and     (iii),     the water-absorbing resin constituting the agglomerates may be damaged   when   destroying   these   agglomerates,   and   the physical    properties    of   the    water-absorbing    resin    may deteriorate.<br>
Moreover, when the aqueous liquid is added to the field of   100°C  or  more,   (i)   a  low-boiling  point  component  (for example,  water)  in the aqueous liquid vaporizes,  and the aqueous liquid is not be added to the water-absorbing resin effectively, (ii) dew condensation occurs in the cooling device by,    for   example,    the   above   vaporized   water,    and    the agglomerates are formed by the dew condensation water, (iii) the agglomerates block the outlet port of the cooling device, and    stable    driving    cannot    be    carried    out,     (iv)    the water-absorbing   resin   adheres   to   the   heat   transferring surface of the cooling device, this lowers the efficiency of heat transfer, and the efficiency of cooling deteriorates practically and  the  physical  properties  of the  water-absorbing  resin<br>
deteriorate.     When adding the aqueous liquid in the cooling step, it is necessary to add the aqueous liquid to the field of the above-described temperatures.     A method for finding out these preferable temperature ranges in the cooling device is, for example, (i) to actually measure temperatures under set driving conditions or (ii) to assume a counter flow or parallel flow contact-type heat exchanger from the temperature of the water-absorbing resin at the input port of the cooling device, the temperature of the water-absorbing resin at the outlet port    of   the    cooling    device,    the    specific    heat    of    the water-absorbing resin, the speed of supply, the temperature of the cooling medium at the input port, the temperature of the   cooling  medium   at  the   outlet  port,   etc.,   calculate  an overall heat transfer coefficient, use the heat transfer area as a function of the distance in the flow direction, and obtain the temperatures by numerical analysis.     The temperature of the aqueous liquid added is usually 0°C or more but less than  the  boiling point,  and preferably from   10°C  to  50°C. The amount of the aqueous liquid added is usually 0.01 mass part to f&gt;0 mass parts with respect to 100 mass parts of the water-absorbing resin powder, preferably 0.01 mass part to 30 mass parts, and more preferably 0.1 mass part to 10 mass parts.<br>
A water spraying device for adding the aqueous liquid is not especially limited as long as it serves the object of the<br>
present invention. However, it is preferable that the device can uniformly spray the aqueous liquid to a narrow area. Preferable examples of the device are a flat spray and a one-fluid or two-fluid spray having spray patterns such as a hollow cone arid a full cone. A further preferable example of the device is a narrow angle spray for spraying to a narrow<br>
remon.<br>
The size of a droplet sprayed is not especially limited, but is preferably and averagely from 10 |um to 1,000 urn.     If the size of the droplet is too large, the water content of the water-absorbing   resin   may   become   nonuniform,   particles having    absorbed    a    large    amount   of   water    may    form agglomerates, and those agglomerates may cause clogging of the device.     Moreover, if the size of the droplet is less than 10    (am,    the    water    sprayed    does    not    adhere    to    the water-absorbing resin effectively, and is discharged from the device   as   splash   or  becomes  the  dew  condensation  water which causes problems.     The most appropriate size of the droplet  is from 50 jam to 500 (am.     As a general  trend,  the M/
aqueous liquid contacts a portion(s) of the device in addition to the water-absorbing resin powder, it is preferable that the water-absorbing resin powder contain, for example, an adherence prevention agent such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polypropylene glycol (PPG).<br>
Various additive agents may be dissolved or dispersed<br>
in the added aqueous liquid so that the added aqueous liquid<br>
has additional (unctions.     Examples of such additive agents<br>
are metal salt, acid, alkali, a deodorant, a coloring agent, an<br>
inorganic antibacterial agent, an organic antibacterial agent,<br>
and   surfactant.      More   specific   examples   of   the   additive<br>
agent   are   (i)   sulfite,   such   as   sodium   bisulfite   (SBS),   for<br>
reducing residual monomers (ii) organic base, inorganic base,<br>
organic  acid,   inorganic  acid,  monovalent  metal  salt,  and<br>
polyvalent metal salt (for example, aluminium sulfate), foradjusting the water-absorbing speed,  (iii)  a deodorant for<br>
giving an odor eliminating function, (iv) a coloring agent for giving a visual value, and (iv) various chelating agents for improving urine resistance. The concentration of the entire additive agents in the aqueous liquid is usually 0.01 mass % to 50 mass %, preferably 0.1 mass % to 40 mass %, and more preferably 1 mass % to 30 mass %.<br>
The stirrer(s) used in the modifying step and the cooling step is (are) not especially limited, and it is possible to use the stirrers explained in the present specification.<br>
For example, only one of the modifying step and the cooling step may be carried out by using the above-described stirrer (stirring means) 100 since it is possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder. In this case, the remaining step can be carried out by using a conventionally known heat stirrer or stirring/cooling device. As the conventionally known device, it is possible to use, for example, a biaxial trough stirrer disclosed in Document 4.<br>
Moreover, it is more preferable that both the modifying step and the cooling step be carried out by using the above-described stirrer (stirring means) 100, since it is possible to carry out the surface crosslinking reaction and the cooling uniformly, and this can further suppresses the generation of the fine powder.<br>
(3. Details Of Manufacture Of Water-absorbing Resin) The   following   will   explain   details   of  a   method   for manufacturing    water-absorbing     resin     of    the     present invention.<br>
(;i - Water-absorbing Resin)<br>
The water-absorbing resin of the present invention is not especially limited, and may be water-absorbing resin obtained by crosslinking the surface of a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer (water-absorbing resin precursor), containing a carboxyl group, by using a surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react<br>

A step of manufacturing the above water-absorbing resin precursor (hereinafter also referred to as "water-absorbing resin precursor manufacturing step") is not especially limited, and it is possible to use, for example, the following step.<br>
(I.   Water-absorbing   Resin   Precursor   Manufacturing<br>
Step)<br>
Manufactured in the water-absorbing resin precursor manufacturing step is the water-absorbing resin precursor which can  be used in the present invention,  contains the carboxyl   group,   and   is   not   surface   crosslinked.       One example     of    the    water-absorbing    resin     precursor    is conventionally   known   resin   which   can   be   obtained   by polymerizing hydrophilic unsaturated monomer containing acrylic acid and/or its salt as the main component, which absorbs a large amount of water (50 times to 1,000 times) in ion    exchanged    water,    and    which    forms    a    hydrophilic crosslinked polymer having a water-swelling property and a water-in solubility.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that a crosslinked structure be formed inside the water-absorbing resin precursor by using an internal crosslinking agent when manufacturing the water-absorbing resin precursor.<br>
The following will explain the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer, the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, the internal crosslinking agent, and a method for polymerizing the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer, however the present invention is not limited to these.<br><hydrophilic unsaturated monomer> One   example   of the  above  hydrophilic   unsaturated monomer is a hydrophilic unsaturated monomer containing acrylic    acid    and/or    its    salt    as    the    main    component.<br>
Moreover, the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer may contain<br>
an unsaturated monomer other than acrylic acid or its salt<br>
according to need. Examples of such an unsaturated<br>
monomer are (i) an anionic unsaturated monomer and its salt,<br>
such as methacrylic acid, maleic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid,<br>
styrene	sulfonic acid,	styrenesulfonic	acid,<br>
2-(meth)acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic	acid,<br>
2-(meth)acryloylethanesulfonic	acid,	and<br>
2-(meth)acryloylpropanesulfonic     acid,     (ii)     a     nonionic hydrophilic group-containing unsaturated monomer, such as acrylamide,       methacrylamide,       N-ethyl(meth)acrylamide, N-n-propyl(meth)acrylamide,     N-isopropyl(meth)acrylamide, N,N-dime thyl(meth) acrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate,<br>

glycol mono(meth)acrylate, vinylpyridine, N-vinylpyrrolidone,<br>
N-acryloyl piperidine, and N-acryloyl pyrrolidine, and (iii) a<br>
cationir	unsaturated	monomer,	such	as<br>
N,N-dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, N,N-die thy laminoethyl(meth)acry late, N,N-dimet.hylaminopropyl(meth)acrylate,<br>
N,N-dimethylaminopropyl(meth)acrylamide, and quaternary salts of these. However, the above "unsaturated monomer other than acrylic acid or its salt" is not especially limited.<br>
In the case of using the above "unsaturated monomer other than acrylic acid or its salt", the amount thereof is preferably 30   mole  %  or  less  of the  entire  hydrophilic  unsaturated monomers, and more preferably 10 mole % or less. <hydrophilic crosslinked polymer><br>
In      the      present      specification,      the      hydrophilic crosslinkcd polymer is synonymous with the water-absorbing resin  precursor, and is not especially limited as long as it absorbs a large amount of water and has the water-swelling property and  the water-insolubility.     Moreover,  it is  more preferable that the acid group in the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer be neutralized with, for example, alkali metal salt, ammonium   salt,   amine   salt,   or   the   like.       Moreover,   the percentage of the acid group neutralized in the crosslinked polymer is preferably from 30 mole % to 100 mole %, more preferably  from  50  mole  %  to  90  mole  %,   and  especially preferably from 60 mole % to 80 mole %.     Therefore, in the present  specification,  the expression "the  water-absorbing resin precursor containing the carboxyl group" implies the expression "the water-absorbing resin precursor containing carboxyl group and/or its  salt".     The  acid group may  be neutralized (a) when preparing the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer   before   obtaining   the   crosslinked    polymer,    (b) during    polymerization    of    the    hydrophilic    unsaturated monomer,   or  (c)  when   the  crosslinked  polymer  is  obtained<br>

The internal crosslinking agent is not especially limited as long as it is a compound, each molecule of which contains a plurality of reactive groups which react with a polymerizable unsaturated group and/or a carboxyl group. That is, the internal crosslinking agent may be a compound, each molecule of which contains a plurality of substituents which are copolymerized with the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer and/or react with the carboxyl group. Note that the hydrophilic unsaturated monomer may be a self crosslinking compound which forms the crosslinked structure without the internal crosslinking agent.<br>

Then, by using, among the above internal crosslinking agents, the internal crosslinking agent each molecule of which contains a plurality of polymerizable unsaturated groups, it is possible to further improve an absorption property, etc. of the water-absorbing resin to be obtained.<br>
The amount of the internal crosslinking agent used is<br>

The water-absorbing resin of the present invention can be obtained by surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin precursor (hydrophilic crosslinked polymer), obtained in the above step, by using the following method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin.<br>
(b-  Method For Surface Crosslinking Water-absorbing Resin)<br>
The       method       for       surface       crosslinking       the water-absorbing resin of the present invention is suitable for mass production  on  an  industrial scale.     In the case of a conventional method for carrying out heat treatment by using a single processing device, there are problems in that (i) the larger the processing device is, the longer the staying time becomes, (ii) the water-absorbing resin is damaged, and (iii) the    physical    properties    of    the    water-absorbing    resin deteriorate.<br>
Conventionally, it has been difficult to obtain both the improvements of the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin to be obtained and the improvement of the productivity. Therefore, in order to obtain both the improvements of the physical properties of the water-absorbing resin to be obtained and the improvement of the productivity, the present inventors have uniquely found that it is effective to carry out, as two separate steps in a<br><br>
process of surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin, (i) acquisition of the dried particulate composition by stirring and drying the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor arid (ii) heating of the dried particulate composition in order to obtain a desired crosslink density. Thus, the present invention has been achieved.<br>
Specifically, the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing  resin  of the  present invention  includes  a step   (1)    of   mixing   the    solution   containing   the   surface crosslinking agent with the water-absorbing resin precursor so as to obtain the wet mixture (hereinafter also referred to as "wet mixture preparing step"), a step (2) of stirring and drying the   wet   mixture   so   as   to   obtain   the   dried   particulate composition    containing   the    surface    crosslinking   agent (hereinafter also referred to as "stirring/drying step") and a step (3) of heating the dried particulate composition so as to cause   the  surface  crosslinking  reaction  (hereinafter also referred   to  as  "surface   crosslinking  step").      Further,   80 weight   %   or   more   of   the   dried   particulate   composition obtained in the stirring/drying step is particles which pass through  a  sieve having a mesh  size of  10  mm,  each  of the stirring/drying  step   and   the   surface   crosslinking   step   is carried  out by using at least one processing device,  and a processing  device   used  for the   stirring/drying  step  and  a<br><br>
processing device used for the surface crosslinking step are serially connected to each other.<br>
That   is,   in   the  wet  mixture   preparing   step   of the method  for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin, the  solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and ihr   w;iirr absorbing   resin   precursor  are   mixed   with   each other,   and   then   the   wet   mixture   is   obtained.      The   wet mixture-   is   put  in   the  processing  device.      When   moisture Yapori/es from the wet mixture, aggregates are easily formed. However,     as    the    stirring    and    drying    proceed    in     the stirring/drying  step,   those  aggregates  break,   and  the  wet mixture disperses and becomes powder 80 weight % or more oi whieh is particles which pass through the sieve having I he mesh    size    of    10    mm,    that    is,    the    dried    participate composition having high flowability.     As above, in the heat treatment   device,   the   characteristics   of  the   wet   mixture changes in accordance with elapsed time.     However,  in a conventional      method      for      surface      crosslinking      the water-absorbing resin, the stirring and heating are carried out    by    a     single    processing    device.         That    is,     the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step are not carried  out separately,  that is,  these steps are carried out under the same conditions.<br>
Meanwhile,    in    the   present   invention,    each   of   the Ztirring/drying   step   and   the   surface   crosslinking   step   is<br>
carried out by using at least one processing device, and the<br>
processing device used for the stirring/drying step and the<br>
processing device used for the surface crosslinking step are<br>
serially connected to each other.     Therefore, in each of these<br>
steps, stirring conditions and the temperature setting can be<br>
determined  in  accordance with  the  characteristics  of the<br>
powder.    As a result, it is possible to shorten a time for the<br>
heat treatment, reduce the damage to the water-absorbing<br>
resin, and obtain the water-absorbing resin having excellent<br>
physical    properties    without   decreasing    the    amount   of<br>
production.<br>
That  is,   in  the  method  for  surface  crosslinking  the water-absorbing   resin   of   the   present   invention,    (i)    the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor are mixed with each other, (ii)  this mixture  is put in  the  heat treatment device,  (iii) although the wet mixture may have low flowability, and a large   amount   of   aggregates   are   formed   when   moisture vaporizes,  those aggregates are broken by strong stirring, and   (iv)   the   water   content   of   the   water-absorbing   resin particle    is    quickly    reduced    by    increasing    an    average temperature-rising speed of the wet mixture, and this makes it possible to break the aggregates in a short period of time. Further,     a     heat     treatment     device     which     earries     out comparatively weak stirring or has no stirring blade can  be<br>
used for the dried particulate composition whose aggregates are broken, particles are dispersed, and flowability is increased. Further, it is possible to lower the average temperature-rising speed of the dried particulate composition, and also possible to easily control the surface crosslink density of the water-absorbing resin (final product).<br>
Only by strengthening the stirring and increasing the average temperature-rising speed, it is possible to carry out the heat treatment in a short period of time. However, if the amount of production is large and the average temperature-rising speed increases, it becomes more difficult to control the crosslink density. Therefore, a step in which the average temperature-rising speed is comparatively low is required to more easily control the surface crosslink density of the final product.<br>
In the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin of the present invention, it is preferable that the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step be carried out continuously. Thus, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin having excellent physical properties in a short period of time.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the processing device used for the stirring/drying step and the processing device-used for the surface crosslinking step be different in type<br>
and /or   elfcetive   volume   from   each   other.      Moreover,   it   is<br>
preferable     that     the     processing     device     used     for     the<br>
stirring/drying step and the processing device used for the<br>
surface crosslinking step be driven under different heating<br>
conditions and/or different stirring conditions.     Thus, it is<br>
possible   to   select   appropriate   heating  conditions   and/or<br>
stirring   conditions   for   each   step,   and   also   possible   to<br>
efficiently   manufacture   the   water-absorbing   resin   having<br>
excellent physical properties.<br>
Note   that   the   above   expression   "different   in   type"<br>
means that the shapes of the processing devices are different<br>
from r;teh other.      Moreover, the above expression "different<br>
in   effective   volume"   means   that   values   of   the   effective<br>
volumes of the processing devices are  different from each<br>
other.     The above expression "different heating conditions"<br>
means that at least one of the type of the heat source which<br>
can be attached to the processing device, the spec of the heat<br>
source device which can be attached to the processing device,<br>
the set temperature of the heat source which can be attached<br>
to the processing device, and the amount of supply per unit<br>
time   of   the   heat   source   which   can   be   attached   to   the<br>
processing     device     is     different.	Further,     the     above<br>
expression "different stirring conditions" means that at least 
unit length of the stirring axis, and the number of rotations of the stirring blade is different.<br>
Moreover, as another embodiment of the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin of the present invention, the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step can be carried out by one processing device, and the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step can be carried out under different processing conditions.<br>
According to the above configuration, in each of the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step, the stirring conditions and the temperature setting ('an he determined in accordance with the characteristics of the powder. As a result, it is possible to shorten the time for the heat treatment. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the damage to the water-absorbing resin, and also possible to obtain the water-absorbing resin having excellent physical properties without decreasing the amount of production.<br>
In the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin, each of the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step can be divided into a plurality of steps. That is, the stirring/drying step can be further divided into a plurality of steps in accordance with the characteristics of the particle. Similarly, the surface crosslinking step can be further divided into a plurality of<br>
steps in accordance with the characteristics of the particle. The following will explain the above respective steps in detail.<br>
(I. Wet Mixture Preparing Step)<br>
The   wet   mixture   preparing   step   is   not   especially limited   as   long   as   it   is   a   step   of  mixing   the   solution containing     the     surface     crosslinking    agent    with     the above-described  water-absorbing resin  precursor  so  as  to obtain   the   wet   mixture.       Moreover,   in   addition   to   the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing   resin   precursor,    the    wet   mixture    may contain an additive agent suitable for the present invention. The  following will  explain  the  surface  crosslinking agent, usable additive agents, and a method and device for mixing the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent with the water-absorbing resin precursor.     However, the present invention is not limited to these.<br><surface crosslinking agent><br>

trimethylolpropane, (ii) a carbonate compound, such as<br>
ethylene carbonate (1,3-dioxolane-2-one), propylene<br>

The   amount  of the   surface  crosslinking  agent   used may be set properly depending on, for example, the surface crosslinking agent  used  or the combination of the surface crosslinking agents to  be used.     Generally,  the amount of the surface crosslinking agent used is preferably in a range Mom   o no]    niiiss   pan   to   5   mass   pans   with   respect   to   the solid  (i-jiicnt  (100  mass  parts)  of the water-absorbing resin precursor, and more preferably in a range from 0.005 mass part to 2 mass parts.     It is not preferable that the amount of the surface crosslinking agent used exceed the above range, since   it   is  uneconomical,   and   the   amount  of the   surface crosslinking  agent   used   is   excessive   to   form   appropriate crosslinked     structure     of     the     water-absorbing     resin. Moreover, when the amount of the surface crosslinking agent used is less than the above range, it tends to be difficult to obtain the surface crosslinked water-absorbing resin having high absorbency against pressure.<br>
In order to dissolve the surface crosslinking agent, it is preferable to use water as a solvent. Moreover, the amount of the solvent used can be changed properly depending on,<br>
for example, the type and particle diameter of the water-absorbing resin precursor. Generally, the amount of the solvent used is preferably in a range from more than 0 mass part to 20 mass parts with respect to the solid content (1 00 mass parts) of the water-absorbing resin precursor, and more preferably in a range from 0.5 mass part to 10 mass parts.<br>
Used in the present invention as the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is preferably a solution containing a surface crosslinking agent which reacts with the carboxyl group of the water-absorbing resin precursor by esterification reaction of polyhydric alcohol, alkylene carbonate, or the like.<br>
Note that in the present specification, a solution prepared by dissolving a surface crosslinking agent in a solvent is termed "the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent".<br>
Moreover, in the present invention, the surface crosslinking may be realized by polymerizing monomers on the surface of the water-absorbing resin precursor (U.S. Patent No. 2005-48221).<br><other additive agents><br>
In addition to the surface crosslinking agent, it is possible to add, to the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent of the present invention, (i) as a<br>
dispersing agent, a surfactant or particles for improving an effectiveness  of mixing,   (ii)   as  a modifying agent,   a  metal complex, and (iii) as other additive agents, an antibacterial agent, a deodorant, an aroma chemical, a food additive, an oxidizing  agent,   a   reducing  agent,   a   chelating  agent,   an oxidation   inhibitor,   a   radical   inhibitor,   and   a   dye   stuff. These additive agents may be added as an aqueous solution prepared  by,  according to need,  dissolving in  a  solvent or dispersing in a solvent.     Moreover, a separate nozzle may be used to add these additive agents.<br>
One  example of the  surfactant  which  can  be used  as the   dispersing   agent   is   a   nonionic,   anionic,   cationic   or amphoteric   surfactant   (disclosed   in   Published   Japanese Translation   of   PCT   International   Publication   for   Patent Application   2002-527547   (Tokuhyo   2002-527547))   whose HLB  value   is   3   or  more.      Moreover,   the   amount  of the surfmMiml used is preferably in a range from 0 mass % to 5 mass % with respect to the water-absorbing resin precursor. One   example    of   the   particles   for   improving   the effectiveness of mixing is inorganic particles, such as carbon black disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 4-214734 (Tokukaihei 4-214734).     Moreover, the amount of the particles used is preferably in a range from 0 mass part to 10   mass   parts   with   respect   to   100   mass   parts   of   the water-absorbing resin precursor.<br>
One example of the metal complex to be used as the modifying agent is a bivalent or polyvalent metal salt solution disclosed in Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Publication for Patent Application 2002-51&gt;7547 (Tokuhyo 2002-527547),<br>
The above antibacterial agent is not especially limited, and it is possible to use conventionally known antibacterial agents having an antibacterial property. One example of the antibacterial agent is an antibacterial agent disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 11-267500 (Tokukaihei 11-267500).<br>
The above deodorant is not especially limited, and it is possible to use conventionally known deodorants which eliminate unpleasant odor of human urine, such as mercaptan, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia. One example of the deodorant is a Theaceae plant extract containing flavanols or flavonols as a deodorant component.<br>
The amount of the additive agent which is added so that the water-absorbing resin has an additional function can be changed properly depending on the purpose of the addition and the type of the additive agent. Generally, the amount of the additive agent is preferably from 0.001 mass part to 10 mass parts with respect to 100 mass parts of the water-absorbing resin precursor, more preferably from 0.01 mass part to 5 mass parts, and further preferably from 0.05<br>
mass part to ]  mass part.<br><mixing method and mixing device> While       satisfying      the       above       conditions,       the water absorbing resin precursor and the solution containing the surface crossliriking agent are put in a mixing device and mixed  with  each  other.     More  specifically,  in the present invention,   by   adding  the   solution   containing  the   surface i rosslmking agent from a nozzle to the water-absorbing resin precursor,   it   is  possible  to  mix  the  water-absorbing  resin precursor     with     the     solution     containing     the     surface crosslinking   agent.       A   mixing   time   is   adjusted   properly depending on the shape and size of the mixing device, and the amount of the  solution containing the surface crosslinking agent.     The mixing time is from 5 seconds to 10 minutes on a normal industrial scale.<br>
Moreover,   when   mixing   the   water-absorbing   resin precursor     with     the     solution     containing     the     surface crosslinking agent, it is possible to use a hydrophilic organic solvent  as  a  solvent  according  to  need.      Examples  of the hydrophilic organic solvent are  (i) lower alcohols,  such as methyl   alcohol,   ethyl  alcohol,   n-propyl  alcohol,   isopropyl alcohol, n-butylalcohol, isobutyl alcohol, and t-butyl alcohol (ii)  kctniK's,   such  as acetone,  (iii)  ethers,   such  as dioxanc, tetrahvdrofuran, and alkoxy polyethylene glycol, (iv) amides, suhc as N,N-dimethylformamide, and (v) sulfoxides, such as<br>
dimethyl sulfoxide.     The amount of the hydrophilic organic-solvent used depends on, for example, the t}rpe and particle diameter   of   the   water-absorbing   resin   precursor,   but   is preferably  20  mass parts  or less with  respect to  the  solid content    (100    mass   parts)    of   the   water-absorbing   resin precursor, more preferably from 0 mass part to 10 mass parts, further preferably from 0 mass part to 5 mass parts,  and especially preferably from 0 mass part to 1 mass part.<br>
The temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor before the addition of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is preferably from 35°C to 80°C, more preferably 35°C to 70°C, and further preferably 35°C to 50°C. It is preferable that the water-absorbing resin precursor be mixed with the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent after the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor is controlled to be in the<br>
above range. If the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor before the addition of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is higher than the above range, the miscibility of the water-absorbing resin precursor with the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent tends to deteriorate. Moreover, in the case of adjusting the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor to be lower than the above range, it may take time to forcedly cool or naturally cool the water-absorbing resin precursor,<br>
powder of the  cooled  water-absorbing resin  precursor may aggregate, and energy loss when reheating may become large. Moreover, it is preferable that the temperature of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent be lower than the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor. Specific-ally, the temperature of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is preferably 10°C or more lower than the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor, more preferably 20°C or more, and especially preferably 30°C or more.     As described above, the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent can be sprayed from a no/./.le.      In such a case, the temperature of the solution should be the freezing point or higher.     Moreover, if the temperature of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is too high, a   liquid   absorption   speed    of   the   water-absorbing   resin precursor   may   become   high,   and   uniform   mixing   may   he<br>
hindered.<br>
Regarding droplets of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent when spraying from the nozzle, its average particle diameter is preferably smaller than the average particle diameter of the water-absorbing resin precursor. Specifically, the average particle diameter of the droplets of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is preferably 300 pm or less, and further preferably 250 pm or less.<br>
Moreover, a maximum spray angle from the nozzle is preferably    50    degrees    or    more.        Thus,    the    solution containing  the  surface  crosslinking agent  can  be   sprayed from ihe nozzle so that a spray pattern is in the shape of a hollow eone showing a circle or the spray pattern is in the shape of an elliptic cone showing a double-convex lens, as disclosed    in    Japanese    Unexamined    Patent    Publication 2002-201290   (Tokukai   2002-201290).      Meanwhile,   if the above spray angle is smaller than 50 degrees, there may be a portion, in the mixing device, where the solution containing the  surface crosslinking agent  is sprayed excessively  and a portion, in the mixing device, where the solution is sprayed less densely, and a mixed state of the water-absorbing resin precursor     and     the     solution     containing     the     surface crosslinking agent may become nonuniform.     Note that the maximum spray angle is 180 degrees or less because of the<br>
configuration of the nozzle.<br>
Further, when the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent is sprayed from the nozzle at the above predetermined spray angle, an area of a region, where a spray diffusing state of the aqueous solution is shown, on a cross section of the mixing device which cross section is perpendicular to the axial direction of the mixing device and contains a spraying point of the nozzle is preferably from 70% to 100% of the area of the cross section perpendicular to the<br>
axial direction of the mixing device, more preferably from 80% to 100%, and further preferably from 90% to 100%. If the area of the region is less than 70%, the mixed state of the water-absorbing resin precursor and the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent may become nonuniform.<br>
The   number of the  nozzles  attached  to  the  mixing device may be one or may be two or more.     However, in order to increase the area of the region, where the spray diffusing state  is  shown,  on the cross  section of the mixing device which cross section contains the spraying point of the nozzle, it is preferable that the number of the nozzles attached to the mixing device be two or more.     In order to surely mix the water-absorbing resin precursor with the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent, the mixing device preferably has  a  high  power of mixing,  and  it is  preferable  that  the water-absorbing resin precursor flow by stirring or airflow.<br>
Examples of the mixing device are a harrow mixing device, a cylinder mixer, a double wall cone mixer, a V-shaped mixer, a ribbon mixer, a screw mixer, a flow type furnace rotary disc mixer, an airflow mixer, a double-arm kneader, an internal mixer, a crush kneader, a rotary mixer, a screw extruder, a Loedige stirrer, and a turbulizer stirrer. Moreover, it is possible to preferably use a high-speed stirring mixer, a harrow mixing device, a sawtooth mixing device, etc. each of which has the stirring axis including a<br>
plurality of the stirring boards. The term "high-speed stirring mix IT" here is a mixer which generates a mixing power by the rotation of the stirring axis including a plurality «i i he •••unlit,', boards. Moreover, the n umber of rot a lions of I he stirring axis is usually from 100 rpm to 5,000 rpm, but is preferably from 200 rpm to 4,000 rpm, and more preferably from 500 rpm to 3,000 rpm.<br>
Moreover,   in  order  to  prevent  the  formation  of the aggregate   by   the   adhesion   of   the   wet   mixture   of   the water-absorbing resin precursor and the solution containing the   surface   crosslinking  agent,   it  is   preferable   that  the mixing device have an inner wall formed by a base material whose contact angle with respect to water is 60 degrees or more and whose heat distortion temperature is 70°C or more. Examples of such a base material are any base materials disclosed   in   Japanese   Unexamined   Patent   Publication 4-214734 (Tokukaihei 4-214734).<br>
It is preferable that the temperature of the inner wall of the mixing device be higher than room temperature. Specifically, the temperature of the inner wall of the mixing device is preferably 40°C or more, and more preferably from 50°C to 100°C or more. Moreover, it is preferable that the temperature of the inner wall of the mixing device be higher than the temperature of the water-absorbing resin precursor. Specifically, the temperature difference between the inner<br>
wall   of  the   mixing  device   and   the  water-absorbing   resin precursor is preferably 40°C or less, and further preferably 20"C or less.     When the temperature of the inner wall of the mixing device is room temperature or less, the wet mixture of the    water-absorbing    resin    precursor    and    the    solution containing the surface crosslinking agent may adhere to the inner wall when mixing the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent with the water-absorbing resin precursor, and the aggregates may be formed. (II. Stirring/Drying Step)<br>
The stirring/drying step may be any step as long as the dried   particulate  composition  which  contains  the   surface crosslinking  agent  and   80  weight  %  or  more  of which   is particles which pass through the sieve having the mesh size of 10 mm  can  be obtained by stirring and drying the wet mixture      Specific conditions,  such  as u  device  used  and drying conditions, are not especially limited.     In order words, the stirring/drying step is a step of breaking, by stirring and drying, the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor which   mixture   is   in   an   aggregate   state   and   is   low   in flowability, so as to obtain the dried particulate composition which  is  high  in  flowability and is  in  a dispersion  state. Note that in the present specification, the term "dry(ing)" is to reduce   the   water   content   of   the   water-absorbing   resin<br>
particles aggregated.<br>
Smre the wet mixture is not dried uniformly or efficiently if it is in an aggregate state, it is preferable in the stirring/drying step that such an aggregate state is broken as soon as possible. Thus, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin more efficiently.<br>
In the stirring/drying step, it is preferable that the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor be changed into particles each of which has such a particle diameter that these particles can pass through the sieve having the mesh size of 10 mm.     More specifically, the particle diameter is preferably   10  mm  or  less,  more  preferably  5  mm  or  less, further preferably 2 mm or less, and especially preferably 1 mm  or less.     Such  particles can disperse  sufficiently,  the flowability of the powder is high, and a heating efficiency in the following surface crosslinking step improves.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that 80 weight % or more of the particles obtained in the stirring/drying step be particles each having the above particle diameter. If the particles each having the above particle diameter is in the above range, it is possible to uniformly carry out the heat treatment with respect to the water-absorbing resin particles in the surface crosslinking step.<br>
Note that a method for measuring the particles which<br>
pass through the sieve having the mesh size of 10 mm is<br>
carried out in accordance with a particle size measuring<br>
method for measuring the water-absorbing resin particles by<br>
using ;i JIS standard sieve.	Specifically, the<br>
water-absorbing resin particles are put in the JIS standard sieve (The IIDA TESTING SIEVE, Internal Diameter of 80 mm) having the mesh size of 10 mm, the particles are classified for a minute by using a low tap sieve shaker (produced by lida Seisakusho, ES-65 Sieve Shaker), and the weight of the particles having passed through the sieve is measured. A method for measuring the particles which pass through a sieve having a mesh size of 5 mm, 2 mm, or 1 mm is carried out similarly in accordance with the above.<br>
In the stirring/drying step, the water content of the wet mix! ure which is a mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor and whose particles are in an aggregate state lowers by the drying. In the stirring/drying step, as the water content of the wet mixture lowers, the aggregates of the particles decrease, and the powder having high flowability can be obtained.<br>
The water content of the water-absorbing resin powder after the stirring/drying step is not especially limited, but may be changed properly depending on a desired crosslinking reaction and/or the type of the surface crosslinking agent<br>
used. Moreover, a lowering rate of the water content of the wet mixture in the stirring/drying step is not especially limited, but is usually preferably from 20% to 90%, more preferably from 30% to 90%, further preferably from 40% Lo 90%, and especially preferably from 50% to 80%.<br>
Note that a method for measuring the water content in the present specification is as follows.<br>
About 1.0 g of the water-absorbing resin powder that is a measurement sample is put in an aluminium cup which is 0.8 g in weight, and the powder is dried for three hours in an oven heated to 180°C, Then, the powder is immediately put in a desiccator and cooled down to around room temperature. Then, the weight of the powder is measured. The water content can be calculated by the following formula.<br>
Water Content (%) = (Weight of Measurement Sample Before Drying - Weight of Measurement Sample After Drying) + (Weight of Measurement Sample Before Drying) * 100<br>
Moreover, the lowering rate of the water content of the wet mixture by the drying in the stirring/drying step can be calculated by the following formula.<br>
Lowering Rate Of Water Content Of Wet Mixture (%) = (Water Content Of Wet Mixture (,%) - Water Content Of<br>
Water-absorbing   Resin   Powder   After   Stirring/drying   Step<br>
(%)) - (Water Content Of Wet Mixture (%)) x  100<br>
In  the  stirring/drying step,  it is preferable  Lo  use a processing device  having a stirring blade.     In the case  of using  a   processing  device   having  a  stirring   blade   whose shape and size are the same as those of a stirring blade of a processing   device    to   be   used    in   the   following   surface crosslinking   step,    it   is    preferable   that   the   number   of rotations  of the  stirring  blade  used  in  the  stirring/drying step be larger than the number of rotations of the stirring blade  used in  the surface crosslinking step.     On a normal production     scale,     the     number     of     rotations     in     the stirring/drying step is in a range preferably from 5 rpm to 300  rpm,   more  preferably  from   10  rpm  to  300  rpm,   and lurtlu'i  preferably Iroin 20 rpm to 300 rpm.<br>
In the case of comparing a stirring blade used in the stirring/drying step and a stirring blade used in the surface crosslinking step when these stirring blades are different from each other, it is possible to use the peripheral speed that is a parameter expressed by the diameter of the stirring blade and the number of rotations of the stirring blade. The peripheral speed is a parameter expressed by the following formula.<br>
(In this formula, V denotes the peripheral speed (m/s),<br>
r  denotes   the   diameter  of  the   stirring  blade   (m),   and   n<br>
denotes the number of rotations of the stirring blade (rpm).)<br>
It is preferable that the peripheral speed of the stirring<br>
blade in the stirring/drying step be higher than that of the<br>
stirring blade in the surface crosslinking step.     A preferable<br>
range  of the  peripheral   speed  in  the   stirring/drying  step<br>
depends on the size of the device.     However, the peripheral<br>
speed is preferably from 0.15 to 10 (m/s), more preferably 0.3<br>
to 10 (m/s), and further preferably 0.5 to 10 (m/s).<br>
As above, if the number of rotations of the stirring blade is large and the peripheral speed of the stirring blade is high, it is possible to shorten the time for the stirring/drying step.<br>
There exist various shapes of stirring blades, and the<br>
shape of the stirring blade in the present invention is not<br>
especially limited.     The number of the stirring blades per<br>
unit length of the stirring axis depends on the shape of the<br>
stirring blade,  but it is preferable that the number of the<br>
stirring blades be large, since strong stirring can be realized.<br>
Generally, as the average temperature-rising speed of<br>
the water-absorbing resin powder increases, a reaction rate<br>
of the surface crosslinking agent also increases.    Therefore,<br>
in    lighi    of   the   improvement   of   the   productivity   of   the wiiicr absorbing   resin,   it   is   preferable   that   the   average irmper.ti lire-rising    speed    of    the    water-absorbing    resin powder in the stirring/drying step be high.     Moreover, in tin-present       invention,       the      increase       in       the       average temperature-rising    speed    of   the    water-absorbing    resin powder   in   the   stirring/drying   step   causes   not   only   the increase in the reaction rate of the surface crosslinking agent but also quick vaporization of moisture contained in the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor.     As a result, the aggregate state is broken, and the powder having high flowability can be obtained in a short period of time.     If the powder     having    high     flowability     is     obtained     in     the stirring/drying step,  it is possible to cause the powder to react in the following surface crosslinking step by stirring that is weaker than that of the stirring/drying step or by a heat   treatment   device   having  no   stirring  blade,   so   as   to obtain a necessary surface crosslink density.     As a result, it is possible to reduce the damage to the water-absorbing resin to   be   obtained   finally,   and   also   possible   to   obtain   the water-absorbing resin having excellent physical properties.<br>
The average temperature-rising speed in the stirring/drying step is not especially limited, and may be changed properly depending on a desired crosslinking<br>
reaction and/or the type of the surface crosslinking agent<br>
used.       Note   that   the   above   "average   temperature-rising<br>
speed"   means   an   average   value   of  temperatures   of  the<br>
water-absorbing   resin   powder   which    temperatures    are<br>
increased in a certain time period in a temperature profile of<br>
the water-absorbing resin moved from the input port to the<br>
outlet   port  in   the   heat   treatment  device.      On   a  normal<br>
production  scale,  the average temperature-rising speed in<br>
five   minutes  from  the   start  of the   stirring/drying  step  is<br>
preferably  10°C/min or more, more preferably  15°C/min or<br>
more, and further preferably 20°C/min or more.     Moreover,<br>
the average temperature-rising speed from 5 minutes after<br>
the start of the stirring/drying step to  15 minutes after the<br>
start of the  stirring/drying  step is  preferably  3°C/min  or<br>
more,    more    preferably    5"C/min    or    more,    and    further<br>
preferably    7"C/min    or    more.	Further,     the     average<br>
temperature-rising speed after 15 minutes after the start of the stirring/drying step is preferably 3°C/min or more. Thus, the wet mixture is subjected to a high temperature in a short period of time. As a result, the moisture contained in the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor vaporizes in a short period of time, and the particles having high flowability can be obtained in a short period of time.<br>
However,  if the average temperature-rising speed in<br>
the stirring/drying step is too high, the surface crosslinking reaction   proceeds   excessively,   and   the   CRC   (Centrifuge Retention Capacity of a physiological saline solution) that is one of important physical properties of the water-absorbing resin to be obtained finally tends to be too low.     Especially, this trend becomes significant in the case of using a highly reactive    surface    crosslinking    agent.        Therefore,    it    is preferable that the average temperature-rising speed in the stirring/drying step be in such a range that a desired CRC can be obtained.<br>
One   factor   for   determining   the   temperature-rising speed of the heat treatment device is a ratio of the heat transfer area to the volume.     By using the heat treatment device whose heat transfer area with respect to the volume is comparatively   large,    it   is   possible   to   realize   a   high temperature-rising   speed   which   is,   as   described   above, preferable  in  the  present  invention.      The   stirring/drying step can be carried out by using a conventionally known heat treatment    device,    however    it    is    preferable    to    select, depending on the production scale of the water-absorbing resin, a heat treatment device whose ratio of the heat transfer area   to   the   effective   volume   (heat   transfer   area/effective volume)   is   appropriate.       Specifically,   the   heat   transfer area/effective volume is preferably 10 m-1 or more, and more preferably   15  nr1   or  more,      Regarding  the   same  type  of<br>
processing devices, the smaller the effective volume is, the larger the heat transfer area/effective volume becomes.<br>
Moreover,      in      order      to      adjust      the      average temperature-rising speed to be in the above preferable range, a heat source can be used for the heat treatment device so us to increase the heating temperature.    The type of the heat source is not especially limited, and examples are (i) heating by causing, for example, pressurized vapor or thermal oil to circulate in a heat medium circulating device and (ii) heating by   heating  wire,   microwave,   or  electromagnetic   induction. These heat medium circulating device and heating device can be attached to any locations, such as a jacket which can be attached   to   the   processing   device   and   the   inside   of   the stirring blade.     The  type of the  heat source,  the  spec of a heal  source device, the set temperature of the heat  source, and  the amount of heat supplied from  the  heat source per unit time can be set properly depending on the type of the surface  crosslinking  agent  used   and   the  type  of the  heat treatment device used.<br>
Moreover, a processing time of the stirring/drying step changes depending on the processing device, but is preferably from 10 minutes to 60 minutes, more preferably from 10 minutes to 40 minutes, and further preferably from 10 minutes to 30 minutes. The shorter the processing time is, the more the productivity of the water-absorbing resin<br>
i m pr\ cs.<br>
The processing device used for the stirring/drying step is    no!    especially    limited,    and    it    is    possible    lo    use    a con ven: ionally  known  processing device  or  heat  treatment device.      For example, by putting in a biaxial trough stirring drver the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor, and heating the mixture, it is possible to stir and dry the wet mixture'     of     the     surface     crosslinking     agent     and     the water-absorbing resin precursor.     The  stirring/drying step can be further divided depending on the characteristics of the particle.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the stirring/drying step<br>
be carried out while supplying carrier gas for adjusting the<br>
temperature and the dew point.     Drying does not necessarily<br>
require heating.     Moreover, the wet mixture can be dried to a<br>
predetermined state by the introduction of the carrier gas.<br>
Examples  of the  carrier  gas  are  vapor,   air,   and  nitrogen.<br>
Moreover,   the   amount   of the   carrier  gas   supplied   is   not<br>
especially   limited,   and   can   be   determined   properly.      By<br>
supplying  the  carrier  gas,  the vapor generated  during the<br>
reaction    in    the    stirring/drying    step    can    be    removed<br>
efficiently.     Thus, it is possible to dry the wet mixture in a<br>
short period of time.<br>
Further, the carrier gas may be properly depressurized<br>
or pressurized. Moreover, the carrier gas may be properly heated or cooled. Generally, it is preferable that air having around room temperature (for example, 0"C to 50"C) be supplied at substantially normal pressure (1.013 * 105 Pa (1 atmospheric pressure) ±10%, preferably ±5%, and more preferably ±1%).<br>
Moreover, when in the stirring/drying step there is a space above the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface  crosslinking  agent  and  the  water-absorbing  resin precursor    which    mixture    does    not    contact    the    heat transferring surface, the temperature and dew point may be controlled to a specific temperature and a specific dew point. Moreover, the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor which mixture is subjected to the stirring/drying step may have a normal temperature or may be heated so that the powder is easy to handle.     However, if the wet mixture is heated   excessively,   the   surface   crosslinking  agent  reacts. Therefore, the temperature of the wet mixture is heated so as to   be   preferably   from  room   temperature   to   100°C,   more preferably   from   room   temperature   to   80°C,   and   further preferably from room temperature to 40°C.<br>
Moreover, in the case of carrying out both the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking step by using one processing device, the heating conditions and/or<br>
stirring conditions which satisfy the above conditions in the stirring/drying step can be set in a former portion of the processing device.<br>
(III. Surface Crosslinking Step)<br>
The surface crosslinking step may be any step as long as the dried particulate composition is subjected to the heat treatment, and this causes a desired surface crosslinking reaction. Specific conditions, such as a device used and reaction conditions are not especially limited. More specifically, for the purpose of obtaining a desired crosslink density, the surface crosslinking step is a step of (i) heating<br>
• !»<br>
the dried particulate composition which is obtained by stirring and drying the wet mixture of the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent and the water-absorbing resin precursor and has high flowability, and (ii) causing a desired crosslinking reaction to proceed.<br>
Regarding the dried particulate composition, the aggregates are broken, the particles are dispersed, and the flowability is high. Therefore, in the surface crosslinking step, it may be possible to use weak stirring or the heat treatment device having no stirring blade. Further, it is possible to lower the average temperature-rising speed of the water-absorbing resin powder, and also possible to more easily control the surface crosslink density of a final product.<br>
Specifically,   the   above   "desired   crosslink   density"<br>
means ihat each of the CRC and AAP measured by methods adopted in the following Examples is in the following range. Thai is, the CRC is preferably from 10 g/g to 60 g/g, more preferably from 20 g/g to 55 g/g, and further preferably from 25 g/g 10 50 g/g. Moreover, the AAP is preferably 10 g/g or more, more preferably 15 g/g or more, and further preferably 20g/g or more.<br>
The average temperature-rising speed in the surface crosslinking   step   is   not   especially   limited,   and   can   be changed        properly       depending        on        the        average temperature-rising   speed   in   the   stirring/drying   step,   a desired crosslinking reaction, and/or the type of the surface crosslinking   agent.      By   strengthening   the   stirring   and increasing the average temperature-rising speed only in the stirring/drying step, it is possible to shorten the processing time, and it is also possible to suppress the damage to the powder since the processing time is short.     However, if the heat treatment is carried out only in the stirring/drying step, the control of the surface crosslink density becomes more difficult since the average temperature-rising speed is high. Here,        by        comparatively        lowering        the        average temperature-rising speed in the surface crosslinking step of the    present    invention,    it    is    possible    to    improve    the controllability  of the   surface  crosslink  density  of a  final product.     Specifically, the average temperature-rising speed<br>
in  the  surface crosslinking step is preferably   10°C/min  or less,   more   preferably   JVC/ruin   or   less,   further   preferably .'•  L',.1111];  or less, and especially  preferably   l"C/imn  or  less. As above, since the surface crosslinking step does not require temperature rising unlike the stirring/drying step, the heat transfer   area/effective   volume   in   the   surface   crosslinking step can  be  smaller than  that in the  stirring/drying step. For  the  reasons described above,  in  the case  of using the same type of devices in the  stirring/drying step and  in  the surface    crosslinking    step,    the   effective    volume    of   the processing   device   used    for   the    stirring/drying    step    is preferably smaller than that of the processing device used for the  surface crosslinking step,  in light of the  temperature rising.<br>
Further, adjusting the average temperature-rising speed in the surface crosslinking step to be in the above range can be realized by increasing^the heating temperature by using the heat sdurce^irfiilire* raapppEreatment device. The?<br>
.<br>
type of the heat. source4 limited, and examples are (i) bjyitinf iWin HMlUPJCj. prrinirirrri vapor or thermal oil to circulate ireat medium circulating device and (ii) tirnJT 'TfTT'Mar Tf ' or electromagnetic induction. Thesjf|ieat medium circulating device and heating device can be leached to any locations, such as a jacket which can be atfached to the processing<br>
device and the inside of the stirring blade. The type of the heat source, the spec of a heat source device, the set temperature of the heat source, and the amount of heat supplied from the heat source per unit time can be set properly depending on the type of the surface crosslinking agent used and the type of the heat treatment device used.<br>
When polyhydric alcohol, carbonate compound, or the like   is   used   as   the   surface   crosslinking  agent,   and   the surface   crosslinking   is   carried   out   by   the   esterification reaction, it is preferable that the temperature profile of the water-absorbing resin powder pass through 190°C or more at which it is possible to sufficiently carry out esterification disclosed,   for  example,   as   an   esterification   crosslinking reaction by polyvalent alcohol in U.S. Patent No, 4,734,478. Moreover, in the surface crosslinking step, the dried particulate composition may be stirred or may not be stirred. In the case of stirring the dried particulate composition, the stirring may be weaker than that in the stirring/drying step since   the   aggregates   have   already   been   broken   in   the stirring/drying step.     Specifically, it is preferable that the number   of rotations   of  the   stirring  blade  in   the   surface crosslinking step be smaller than that in the stirring/drying step, and the peripheral speed of the stirring blade in the surface   crosslinking   step   be   lower   than   that   in   the stirring/drying step.    The number of rotations of the stirring<br>
blade in the surface crosslinking step is preferably in a range from 0 rpm to 30 rpm, more preferably in a range from 0 rpm lo 20 rpm, and further preferably from 0 rpm to 10 rpm. Further, the peripheral speed of the stirring blade in the surface crosslinking step is preferably 2 m/s or less, more preferably 1 m/s or less, and further preferably 0.3 m/s or less. The number of the stirring blades per unit length of the stirring axis depends on the shape of the stirring blade, but is preferably small. This is because the smaller the number of the stirring blades per unit length of the stirring axis is, the weaker the stirring becomes.<br>
A device used for the surface crosslinking step is not especially limited, and a device used for the stirring/drying step ran be used for the surface crosslinking step. Note that since it is not necessary to stir the mixture in the surface crosslinking step, it is also possible to use a device having no stirring blade. The surface crosslinking step can be further divided depending on the characteristics of the particle.<br>
Moreover, in the case of carrying out both the stirring/drying step and the surface crosslinking slep by using one processing device, the heating conditions and/or stirring conditions which satisfy the above conditions in the surface crosslinking step can be set in a latter portion of the processing device.<br>
Moreover, in the method for manufacturing the wnlcr-ahsorbing resin of the present invention, it is preferable that the water-absorbing resin be cooled down after the surface crosslinking step.<br>
In the case of using the above  surface crosslinking method of the present invention, it is possible to preferably use, in the above step (2),  step (3)  and/or cooling step, a processing device including the stirring means explained in the   above    [Aspect   Of   Stirrer   (Stirring   Means)    Used   In Modifying    Step    And/or    Cooling    Step    In    Method    For Manufacturing Water-absorbing Resin Of Present Invention]. In this case, at least one of the above steps (2) and (3) and cooling step is carried out by using the processing device including    the    stirring    means.         However,    since    the processing device including the stirring means can carry out the surface crosslinking reaction and the cooling uniformly, it is preferable that all of the steps (2) and (3) and cooling step be carried out by using the processing device including the stirring means.<br>
Note that in the case of carrying out at least one of the step (2) and (3) and cooling step by using the processing device including the stirring means, it is possible to obtain the effect of suppressing the generation of the fine powder by the processing device including the stirring means. In this case, the processing device and heat treatment device<br>
described   in    (1.    Modifying   Step)   can   be   used   for   the remaining steps.<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the processing devices<br>
used in the steps (2) and (3) and cooling step be different in<br>
type and/or effective volume from each other.     Moreover, it<br>
is preferable that the processing devices used in the steps (2)<br>
and (3)  and cooling step be driven under different heating<br>
conditions and/or different stirring conditions.     Thus, it is<br>
possible   to   select   the   heating   conditions   and/or   stirring<br>
conditions which  are  appropriate  for each  step,  and  also<br>
possible to efficiently manufacture the water-absorbing resin<br>
having excellent physical properties.<br>
Not that the above "processing devices different in type from each other" means that the shapes of the processing devices are different from each other. Moreover, the above "processing devices different in effective volume from each other" means that the values of the effective volumes of the processing devices are different from each other.<br>
The above "different heating conditions" means that at least one of (i) the type of the heat source which can be attached to the processing device, (ii) the spec of the heat source device which can be attached to the processing device, (iii) the set temperature of the heat source which can be attached to the processing device, (iv) the amount of heat supplied, per unit time, from the heat source which can be<br>
attached to the processing device, and (v) the heat transferring means included in the stirring board, the rotation axis, or the scraping blade is different.<br>
Further, the above "different stirring conditions" means that at least one of (i) the ratio of the maximum thickness of the stirring board to the minimum thickness of the stirring board, (ii) the shape of the stirring board, (iii) the diameter of the stirring board, (iv) the number of the stirring boards per unit length of the rotation axis, (v) the number of rotations of the stirring board, (vi) the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade, (vii) the length of the scraping blade in the y direction, and (viii) the number of the scraping blades attached to the stirring boards is different.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the description of the embodiments above, but may be altered within the scope of the claims. An embodiment based on a proper combination of technical means disclosed in different embodiments is encompassed in the technical scope of the present invention. [Examples]<br>
The following will explain the present invention in more de-tail on the basis of Examples and Comparative Examples, however the present; invention is not limited to these Examples. Note that the water-absorbing resin and properties of the water-absorbing resin are measured by the<br>
following methods.<br>
Note that since the water-absorbing resin used as an<br>
end  product such as hygienic goods is wet,  measurements<br>
are carried out after the water-absorbing resin is separated<br>
from  the end product and dried at low temperature under<br>
reduced pressure (for example, at 60°C under pressure of 1<br>
mmHg or less for 12 hours).     Moreover, the water content of<br>
the      water-absorbing     resin     used     in      Examples     and<br>
Comparative Examples in the present invention is 6 mass %<br>
or less.<br>
A person with ordinary skill in the art can make various changes, modifications, and alterations within the scope of the present invention. Note that CRC (Centrifuge Retention Capacity), AAP (Absorbency Against Pressure (absorbency under pressure of 4.83 kPa)), SFC (Saline Flow Conductivity), and a particle size in the following Examples and Comparative Examples were evaluated in the following manner.<br><crc measurement></crc>
The CRC was evaluated as absorbency measured under no pressure for 30 minutes using a 0.90 mass % physiological saline solution. Specifically, 0.20 g of the water-absorbing resin was uniformly put into a bag (60 mm * 60 mm) made of nonwoven fabric at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) and 50% RH, and the bag was sealed and immersed<br>
in the 0,9 mass % physiological saline solution at room tempenii lire. The bag was pulled out of the solution 30 minutes later, and was drained off using a centrifuge (produced by Kokusan Co., Ltd., Centrifuge: Type H-122) by 250G for 3 minutes. Then, a weight Wl (g) of the bag was measured. Moreover, the same operation was carried out without the water-absorbing resin. Then, a weight WO (g) of the bag was measured. Then, the absorbency (g/g) was calculated by Formula (1) below using Wl and WO.<br>
Absorbency (g/g)<br>
= (Wl (g) - WO (g))/Weight Of Water-absorbing Resin (g)<br>
(I)<br><aap measurement></aap>
The AAP was evaluated as absorbency under pressure<br>
of   4.83    kPa    for   60    minutes    using    the    0.90    mass    %<br>
physiological saline solution.     Specifically, a stainless steel<br>
400 mesh metal screen (mesh size 38 jam) was fusion-bonded<br>
to   the   bottom   of a  plastic   supporting  cylinder  having  an<br>
internal     diameter     of    60     mm,     and     0.90     g     of    the<br>
water -absorbing  resin  was   uniformly   spread   on   the   metal<br>
screen   at  room  temperature   (20°C   to  25°C)   and   50%  RH.<br>
Then, a piston and a load were placed in this order on the<br>
water absorbing   resin.       The   piston   and   the   load   were<br>
adjusted so as to apply load of 4.83 kPa (0.7 psi) uniformly to the water-absorbing resin. Each of the piston and the load had an external diameter which was slightly smaller than 60 mm so that (i) there was no gap between the piston (the load) and the supporting cylinder and (ii) the vertical motions of the piston (the load) were smooth. A weight Wa (g) of this complete set of measuring device was measured.<br>
A glass filter (produced by Sogo Rikagaku Glass Works Co.,   Ltd.,   Pore   Diameter:   100   jam   to   120   jam)   having   a diameter of 90 mm was placed inside a petri dish having a diameter of 150 mm, and a 0.90 mass % physiological saline solution (20°C to 25°C) was added to the petri dish so that the  liquid  level  of the  0.90  mass  %  physiological  saline solution was the same as the top surface of the glass filter. Then, a piece of filter paper (produced by Advantec Toyo Co., Ltd., Product Name: (JIS P 3801, No.2), Thickness: 0.26 mrn, Retained Particle Diameter: 5 pm) having a diameter of 90 mm was placed on the glass filter so that the surface of the filter   paper   got   wet   entirely,   and   excessive   liquid   was removed.<br>
The complete set of measuring device was placed on the wet filter paper, and the liquid was absorbed under pressure. The complete set of measuring device was lifted up an hour later, and a weight Wb (g) of the complete set of measuring device was measured. Then, the absorbency<br>
against  pressure (g/g) was calculated by Formula (2) below using Wa and Wb.<br>
Absorbency Against Pressure (g/g)<br>
-  (Wa (g) - Wb (g))/Weight (0.9 g) of Water-absorbing<br>
Resin       •••(2)<br><sfc measurement></sfc>
The saline flow conductivity (SFC) is a value indicating<br>
liquid permeability of swollen water-absorbing resin particles or swollen water-absorbing resin composition. The larger the SFC value is, the higher the liquid permeability is.<br>
The measurement was carried out in accordance with a saline How conductivity (SFC) test disclosed in Published Japanese Translation of PCT International Publication for Patent Application 9-509591 (Tokuhyohei 9-509591).<br>
An   apparatus   shown   in   Figure   4   was   used.      The<br>
water-absorbing   resin   (water-absorbing   resin   composition)<br>
(0.900 g)  evenly  spread in  a container 400 was  swollen  in<br>
artificial   urine   (1)   under   pressure  of U.3   psi   (2.07   kl'u)   for<br>
bOminutes, and then the height of a gel layer of a gel 440 was<br>
recorded.     Next, under pressure of 0.3 psi (2.07 kPa), a 0.69<br>
mass % saline solution 330 was supplied from a tank 310 at<br>
a   certain   hydrostatic  pressure   so  as  to  pass  through   the<br>
swollen  gel  layer.     This  SFC  test was  carried  out at room<br>
temperature (20°C to 25°C).<br>
Using a computer and a balance, the amount of liquid passing through the gel layer was recorded every 20 seconds for 10 minutes as a function of time. A flow speed Fs (T) of the liquid passing through (mainly between the particles of) the swollen gel 440 was determined by dividing an increased weight (g) by an increased time (s) and expressed by g/s.<br>
A time the hydrostatic pressure became constant and the flow speed became stable is Ts. Data obtained in 10 minutes from Ts is used for calculating the flow speed. Then, the value of Fs (T = 0), that is, an initial flow speed of the liquid passing through the gel layer was calculated using the flow speed. Fs (T = 0) was extrapolated from a result of a least square method of Fs (T) versus time.<br>
Saline Flow Conductivity (SFC) = (Fs (t = 0) x L0)/(px A xAP) = (Fs (t = 0) x LO)/139506<br>
In this formula, Fs (t = 0) denotes the flow speed and is shown by g/s, LO denotes the height of the gel layer and is shown by cm, p denotes the density of a NaCl solution (1.003 g/cm3), A denotes the area of an upper surface of the gel layer in a cell 410 (28.27 cm2), and AP denotes the hydrostatic pressure applied to the gel layer (4,920 dyne/cm2). In addition, the<br>
unit of the SFC value is 10'7-cm3-s-g'1.<br>
Regarding the apparatus shown in Figure 4, a glass tube 320 was inserted into a tank 310, the lower end of the glass tube 320 was placed so that the liquid level of the 0.69 mass % saline solution 330 was maintained to be 5 cm above the bottom of the swollen gel 440 in the cell 410.    The 0.69 mass % saline solution 330 in the tank 310 was supplied to the cell 410 through an L-shaped tube 340 having a cock.     A container 480 for collecting the liquid having passed through the cell 410 was placed under the cell 410, and this collecting container 480 was placed on an even  balance 490.     The internal diameter of the cell 410 was 6 cm, and a No. 400 stainless   steel   metal   screen   420   (mesh   size   38   Mm)   was provided at the bottom of the cell 410.<br>
A hole 470 through which liquid can pass was formed at a lower portion of the piston 460, and a glass filter 450 having high permeability was provided at a bottom of the piston 460 so that the water-absorbing resin particles or the swollen gel do not get into the hole 470. The cell 410 was placed on a base for mounting a cell, and a stainless steel metal screen 430 which does not disturb the penetration of the liquid was placed on a surface of the base, the surface being in contact with the cell 410.<br>
Artificial urine (1) was a mixture of 0.25 g of calcium chloride dihydrate,  2.0 g of potassium chloride,  0.50 g of<br>
magnesium chloride hcxahydrate, 2.0 g of sodium sulfate, u.H5 g oi ammonium dihydrogcn phosphate, 0.15 g of diarnmunium hydrogen phosphate, and 994.25 g of pure \\ a l e r.<br>
• Particle Size Measurement&gt;<br>
The water-absorbing resin particles were classified by JIS standard sieves having mesh sizes of 850 jum, 710 M"i, 600 pm, 500 pm, 425 |um, 300 jum, 212 |um, 150 jum, 106 urn, and 45 jam, the weight percentage of particles each having the particle diameter of less than 150 |um was measured, and a residual percentage R of each particle size was plotted to a logarithmic probability sheet. Thus, a particle diameter corresponding to R = 50 mass % was considered as the weight average particle diameter (D50).<br>
Regarding the classification, 10.00 g of the water-absorbing resin was put into the JIS standard sieves (The IIDA TESTING SIEVE, Internal Diameter of 80 mm)<br>
-    '         :'„.,*«»;"<br>
having the above mesh sizes, and classified with the low tap sieve shaker (produced by lida Seisakusho, ES-65 Sieve Shaker) for five minutes. Note that the "mass average particle diameter (D50)" of particles corresponds to a certain mesh size of a standard sieve on which 50 mass % of the particles remain, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,051,259, etc.<br>
^ Manufacture	Example:	Manufacture	of<br>
Water absorbing K'csin Precursor&gt;<br>
In a kneacler having two sigma blades, (i) prepared was a monomer aqueous solution which contains sodium acrylate, acrylic- acid and water, whose monomer concentration was 38 mass %, and whose neutralization ratio was 70 mole %, and (ii) polyethylene glycol diacrylate (the average number of ethylene glycol units: Q) was dissolved as the internal crosslinking agent so that polyethylene glycol diacrylate is 0.03 mole % with respect to the monomers.<br>
Next, nitrogen gas was blown in the monomer aqueous<br>
solution to reduce dissolved oxygen in the monomer aqueous<br>
solution, and  nitrogen  substitution was carried out in the<br>
entire reactor vessel.     Then, while causing two sigma blades<br>
to rotate, sodium persulfate (0.12 g/mol with respect to the<br>
monomers) and L-ascorbic acid (0.005 g/mol with respect to<br>
the monomers) were added as the polymerization initiator,<br>
and the polymerization with stirring was carried out in the<br>
kneader.	About    40     minutes     later,     the     hydrophilic<br>
crosslmked   polymer  whose   average   particle   diameter  was<br>
about 2 mm was obtained.<br>
In the case of using the obtained hydrophilic crosslinked polymer in Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 to 4, it was dried by a hot air drier at 170°C for 55 minutes. Meanwhile, in the case of using the obtained !i\ ii rophilic ( i usslinkcd polymer in Examples 5 and h and<br>
Comparative Examples 5 and 6, it was dried by a hot air drier at 170"C for 60 minutes. The dried polymer was crushed by a roller mill, the crushed particles were classified by sieves having the mesh sizes of 850 um and 105 urn, and obtained was a water-absorbing resin precursor (A) whose water content was 5%, weight average particle size was 478 pm, and weight percentage of particles each having the particle diameter of less than 150 jam was 0.8%. <example><br>
3.9      mass      parts      of      a      surface      crosslinking agent-containing   aqueous   solution   containing   0.34   mass part   of   1,4-butanediol    (hereinafter   also    referred    to   as "1,4-BD"), 0.56 mass part of propylene glycol (hereinafter also referred to as "PG"), and 3 mass parts of pure water was sprayed   to   and   mixed   with   100   parts   by  weight   of  the water-absorbing     resin      precursor      (A),      obtained      in Manufacture Example, by a continuous high-speed stirring mixer (Turbulizer produced by Hosokawa Micron).     Thus, a wet product was obtained.     This wet product was subjected to the heat treatment by using a conductive heat transfer trough stirring dryer (produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd., Multi-fin Processor; NFP-1.6W) whose paddle (stirring board) diameter was 170 mmcp, heat transfer area was 1.5 m2, and effective volume was 0.089 m3.<br>
The conductive heat transfer trough stirring dryer was<br><br>
a biaxial trough stirring dryer in which (i) 15 stirring boards each  of which  has  the  scraping blade  and was a  flat disc shape (fan shape) were provided for each rotation axis (the total number of stirring boards was 30) (In the cross section taken    along    the   y-z   plane,    the   ratio   of   the    maximum thickness of the stirring board to the minimum thickness of the stirring board was "4 mm/4 mm = 1", the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade was "120 mm *  30 mm = 3,600 mm2", and the area between the stirring boards was 16,366 mm2), and (ii) the rotation axes are provided in parallel with each other.    The stirring boards attached to two rotation axes do not overlap each other, and are provided in parallel with each other.    The term "overlap* means that when the conductive heat transfer trough stirring dryer has a plurality of rotation axes, a plurality of stirring boards provided on different rotation axes engages with each other.<br>
Heated vapor was injected in the inner wall, stirring board and rotation axis of the stirring dryer, and the surface temperature of each of the inner wall, the stirring board and the rotation axis was 210°C.    A throughput was 45 kg/h, and an average staying time was 60 minutes.     After the heat treatment, the surface crosslinked water-absorbing resin was put in a cooling device (produced by Okawara Seisakusho, Horizontal  Continuous  Fluidized  Bed   Dryer  With  Heating Tube;    FCA-2)   serially   connected   to   the   stirring   dryer,<br><br>
Regarding     the     cooling     by     the     cooling     device,     the water-absorbing   resin   was   cooled   down    by    (i)    causing normal-temperature  tap  water  to  circulate  in  the  heating tube, and (ii) room temperature wind of 0.5m/s with respect to a floor surface of 0.3 m2.     This water-absorbing resin was sieved by a sieve having the mesh size of 850 (am.     Thus, modified water-absorbing resin (water-absorbing resin 1) was obtained.     The amount of the resin having passed through the sieve having the mesh size of 150 ^m was  1.0% of the entire      weight      of      the      above      surface      crosslinked water-absorbing resin.     The modified water-absorbing resin had the CRC of 29 (g/g), the AAP of 26 (g/g), and the average particle diameter of 480 pm,     Results are shown in Table 1. <example><br>
3.9     mass     parts     of     the     surface     crosslinking agent-containing   aqueous   solution   containing   0.34   mass part of 1,4-butanediol, 0.56 mass part of propylene glycol, and 3 mass parts of pure water was sprayed to and mixed with    100   parts   by   weight   of   the   water-absorbing   resin precursor   (A),   obtained   in   Manufacture   Example,   by   the continuous high-speed stirring mixer (Turbulizer produced by Hosokawa Micron).     Thus, the wet product was obtained. This  wet  product was  continuously  processed  by  a conductive heat transfer trough stirring dryer (produced by Nara   Machinery  Co.,   Ltd.,   Paddle   Dryer;   NPD-1.6W),   the<br>
throughput of which was 40 kg/h.     Tins stirring dryer was serially connected  to  the cooling device  (produced  by  Nara Muchincry     Co.,     Ltd.,     Multi-fin     Processor;     NFP-1.6W). Regarding  the  number of rotations  of the  paddle  (stirring board) of each device, the number of the stirring dryer was set to 30 rpm, and the number of the cooling device was set to -&gt;U rpm.      Burrr! I herm /HUU produced by Ma t su mil ra Oil Co  , Ltd.   was   used   as   a   heat  medium,   the   heat   medium   was caused to circulate in the paddle of the stirring dryer, and normal-temperature tap water was caused to circulate in the jacket    and    paddle   of   the    cooling   device.        The   above conductive   heat   transfer   trough   stirring   dryer   had   two rotation axes, and the stirring boards attached to these two rotation  axes are provided so as to overlap each other and engage with each other.<br>
The temperature of the powder of the water-absorbing<br>
resin at the raw material supply opening of the stirring dryer<br>
was 40°C, and the temperature of the powder of the<br>
water-absorbing resin at the water-absorbing resin discharge<br>
opening of the stirring dryer was 2 10°C. The stirrer and the<br>
cooling were serially connected to each other by using a<br>
stainless pipe.	The water-absorbing resin surface<br>
crosslmked in the modifying step was immediately conveyed t the cooling device, and was subjected to the cooling step. The surface crosslinked water-absorbing resin thus obtained<br>
was sieved by using the JIS standard sieve having the mesh size of 850 jam. Thus, modified water-absorbing resin (water-absorbing resin 2) was obtained.<br>
The staying time in the modifying step was 60 minutes, and the staying time in the cooling step was 64.5 minutes. The amount of the resin having passed through the sieve having the mesh size of 150 |um was 2.1% of the entire weight of the above surface crosslinked water-absorbing resin. The modified water-absorbing resin had the CRC of 28 (g/g), the AAP of 25 (g/g), and the average particle diameter of 455 jam. <example><br>
The modified water-absorbing resin (water-absorbing resin 1) obtained in Example 1 was classified by the JIS standard sieves having the rnesh sizes of from 850 jum to 150 Mm, Thus, the water-absorbing resin whose particle size was adjusted was obtained. Note that the average particle diameter of the water-absorbing resin whose particle size was adjusted was 480 (am, and the amount (150 pass amount) of the resin having passed through the sieve having the mesh size of 150 jam was 1.0%.<br>
Using the above water-absorbing resin whose particle size was adjusted, mixing was carried out by a batch cooling device (produced by Nara Machinery Co., Ltd., Multi-fin Processor; NFP-1 .6W) whose water-absorbing resin discharge opening was closed. The number of rotations of the paddle<br>
(stirring board) of the batch cooling device was 30 rpm, normal-temperature tap water was injected in the inner wall, stirring board and rotation axis of the batch cooling device, and the amount of the water-absorbing resin accumulating in a cooling container was 50 kg.<br>
While stirring at SOrpm, samples were taken out every predetermined time (30 minutes after the start of the mixing, 60 minutes after the start of the mixing, and  120 minutes after the start of the mixing).     Thus, water-absorbing resin (3-1 to 3-3) were obtained.     The water-absorbing resin 3-1 had the 150 pass amount of 1.0%, the water-absorbing resin 3-2    had    the     150    pass    amount    of    1.1%,    and    the water-absorbing resin 3-3 had the 150 pass amount of 1.3%. <comparative example><br>

part of 1,4-butanediol, 0.56 mass part of propylene glycol,<br>
and 3 mass parts of pure water was sprayed to and mixed<br>
with    100   parts   by   weight   of   the   water-absorbing   resin<br>
precursor   (A),   obtained   in   Manufacture   Example,   by  the<br>
continuous high-speed stirring mixer (Turbulizer produced<br>

This  wet  product was  subjected to  the heat treatment by<br>
using  the  conductive  heat  transfer  trough  stirring  dryer<br>
(produced by Nara Machinery Co.,  Ltd.,  NPD-1.6W) whose<br>

Moreover,     it     is     preferable     that     a     method     for manufacturing     water-absorbing     resin     of     the     present invention include: a modifying step that is a step of heating a mixture  of a  hydrophilic  crosslinked  polymer containing a carboxyl group and an aqueous solution containing a surface '•rosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which   react with   the  carboxyl  group,   so  as  to  crosslink  a surface of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer; and a cooling step  of cooling  down   the  hydrophilic  crosslinked  polymer thus    surface    crosslinked,    and    in    this    method,    (I)    the modifying  step  and/or  the  cooling  step  be  carried  out   by using   stirring   means   including   a   rotation   axis   having   a plurality of stirring boards having scraping blades, (II) where a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is an x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction is a z direction, (i) a cross-sectional area of the scraping blade in a cross section taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means be 10% or more but less than  50% of an area in the y-z plane between one stirring board  from w7hich the  scraping blade projects and another stirring board provided so as to face the above one<br>
stirring hoard, and (ii) a length of the scraping blade in the y dirct-lion   in   tin   cross  section   taken  along  the y-z plane  be 50".  or more of a distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board, and (III) a ratio of a maximum thickness of the stirring board to a minimum thickness of the stirring board be 5 or less in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means. According   to   the   above   configuration,    since   the cross-sectional   area   and   length   of   the   scraping   blade provided on the stirring board are adjusted to be in the above ranges,   it  is  possible   to   stir  the   hydrophilic   crosslinked polymer in a floating state without excessively compressing the  hydrophilic crosslinked polymer,  and also  possible  to prevent the aggregate and compression of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer.     Therefore,  it is possible  to  suppress the generation of the fine powder.     Further, since the ratio of the maximum thickness to the minimum thickness is 5 or less,    that   is,    the    stirring   board   whose    thickness    is comparatively uniform is used, it is possible to reduce the compression applied to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer per cross-sectional area of the  stirring board  and release from the compression.     Thus,  it is possible to reduce  the mechanical damage to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. Therefore, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small.<br>
Moreover, in the method for manufacturing the v\';itcr absorbing resin of the present invention, it is preferable that eaeh of the scraping blades project from a plurality of the stirring boards, and the adjacent scraping blades among the scraping blades be provided alternately while sandwiching the rotation axis or be provided in parallel with r;ich other, in the cross section taken along the y-z plane of the stirring means.<br>
According to the above configuration, the cross-sectional area of the scraping blade can be made larger relative to the area in the y-z plane between (i) one stirring board I corn which the scraping blade projects or from which i he scraping blade which is also connected to the other stirring board(s) projects and (ii) another stirring board provided so as to lace the above one stirring hoard (hereinafter referred to as "area between the stirring boards"), and the length of the scraping blade can be increased.<br>
Moreover, since the scraping blade is strongly fixed on the stirring board, it is possible to increase durability of the scraping blade. Therefore, it is possible to improve the efficiency of stirring and the delivery of powder, and also possible to carry out the surface crosslinking uniformly. Therefore, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is further small. Moreover, in the method for manufacturing the<br><br>
wa ter-absorbing resin of the present invention, it is prefer.-ible that the stirring board be in a dise shape or a dise shape a part of which is lacking.<br>
According to the above configuration, as compared with a case where the stirring board is, for example, a wedge shape, it is possible to reduce the pressure applied to the hydrophiltc crosslinked polymer when stirring the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the density of powder of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. Therefore, it is possible to more efficiently manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small.<br>
Moreover, in the method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin of the present invention, it is preferable than the stirring board also function as heat transferring means.<br>
In order to crosslink the surface of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, it is necessary to heat the mixture of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing the carboxyl group and the aqueous solution containing the surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group.<br>
According to the above configuration, the stirring means can carry out stirring without mechanically damaging the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, can carry out stirring<br>
uniformly, and also functions as the heat transferring means. Therefore, while suppressing the generation of the fine powder, it is possible to uniformly apply, to the mixture, heat necessary for the crosslinking reaction. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently carry out the crosslinking reaction, and also possible to shorten the time of modification. On this account, it is possible to efficiently manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small.<br>
Moreover, a case where the stirring board is a disc shape or a disc shape a part of which is lacking is larger in the heat transfer area than a case where the stirring board is, for example, a wedge shape. Therefore, it is possible to improve the efficiency of the crosslinking reaction.<br>
Further, since it is unnecessary to separately provide the heat transferring means, it is possible to miniaturize a water-absorbing resin manufacturing device.<br>
Moreover, in the method for manufacturing the water-absorbing resin of the present invention, it is preferable thai the stirring board also function as cooling means.<br>
According to the above configuration, the stirring means can cool down the surface crosslinked hydrophilic crosslinked polymer while uniformly stirring the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer without mechanically damaging the<br>
hydrophilic crosslinked polymer.     Therefore, it is possible to suppress the generation of the fine powder in the cooling step, and   also    possible    to    uniformly    cool   down    the    entire hydrophilic    crosslinked    polymers.        Therefore,    without excessively proceeding with the  surface crosslinking,  it is possible   to   manufacture   the   water-absorbing   resin,   the amount of fine powder of which is small.    Moreover, since it is unnecessary to separately provide the cooling means, it is possible      to      miniaturize      the     water-absorbing      resin manufacturing device.<br>
As above, the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes the steps of (i) mixing the solution containing the surface crosslinking agent with the water-absorbing resin precursor, so as to obtain the wet mixture, (ii) stirring and drying the wet mixture, so as to obtain the dried particulate composition containing the surface crosslinking agent, and (lii) carrying out the heat treatment of the dried particulate composition, so as to cause the surface crosslinking reaction of the dried particulate composition.<br>
By stirring and drying the wet mixture so that the aggregate of particles which occurs when processing the wet mixture is suppressed, it is possible to obtain the dried particulate composition which is powder having high flowability. Therefore, in the step of causing the surface<br>
rrnsslinking reaction, it is possible to carry out a desired<br>
surface crosslinking with weak stirring or a device having no<br>
stirring blade.	Therefore, the method for surface<br>
crosslinking the water-absorbing resin of the present invention can stably manufacture the water-absorbing resin having excellent physical properties.<br>
Moreover, in the method for surface crosslinking the water-absorbing resin of the present invention, since efficient heating conditions and/or stirring conditions can be selected for each step, the staying time in the heat treatment device can be shortened. Therefore, it is possible to improve the productivity of the water-absorbing resin.<br>
Moreover,    as    above,    a   method    for   manufacturing<br>
water absorbing   resin   of   the   present   invention   includes   a<br>
modifying   step   that   is   a   step   of  heating   a   mixture   of  a<br>
hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing a carboxyl group<br>
and  an  aqueous  solution  containing a  surface crosslinking<br>
agent containing two or more functional groups which react<br>
with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink a surface of the<br>
hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer;   and   a   cooling   step   of<br>
cooling   down   the   hydrophilic   crosslinked   polymer   thus<br>
surface  crosslinked,  and  in  this method,  (I)  the  modifying<br>
step  and/or  the  cooling  step  are/is  carried  out  by  using<br>
stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of<br>
stirring   boards,   and   (II)   where   a   direction   parallel   to   a<br>
longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction thai is ptTpcndicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is nn x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction and the y direction is a z direction, a ratio of a maximum thickness of the stirring board to a minimum thickness of the stirring board is 5 or less in a cross section taken along a y-z plane of the stirring means.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to reduce the compression applied to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer per cross-sectional area of the stirring board and release from the compression, and also possible to uniformly stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer while suppressing the mechanical damage to the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer. Therefore, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is small.<br>
Moreover, as above, a method for manufacturing water-absorbing resin of the present invention includes: a modifying step that is a step of heating a mixture of a hydrophilic crosslinked polymer containing a carboxyl group and an aqueous solution containing a surface crosslinking agent containing two or more functional groups which react with the carboxyl group, so as to crosslink a surface of the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer; and a cooling step of cooling down the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer thus<br>
surface  crosslinked,   and  in  this  method,   (I)  the  modifying slep   and/or   the   cooling   step  are/is   carried   out   by   using stirring means including a rotation axis having a plurality of stirring boards having scraping blades, (II) where a direction parallel to a longitudinal direction of the rotation axis is a y direction, a direction that is perpendicular to the y direction and is parallel to a circumferential direction of the rotation axis is an x direction, and a direction perpendicular to the x direction    and    the    y    direction    is    a    z    direction,    (i)    a cross-sectional area of the scraping blade in a cross section taken along a v-z plane of the stirring means is 10% or more but less than 50% of an area in the y-z plane between one stirring  board  from which the  scraping  blade  projects and another stirring board  provided so as to face the above one-stirring board, and (ii) a length of the scraping blade in the y direction  in  the cross section taken along the y-z plane  is 50% or more of a distance in the y-z plane between the above one stirring board and the above another stirring board.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to uniformly stir the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer without excessively compressing the hydrophilic crosslinked polymer, and also possible to efficiently prevent the generation of the fine powder which is easily generated in the modifying step. On this account, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbing resin, the amount of fine powder of which is<br>
small.<br>
