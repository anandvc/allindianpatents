The in vitro activity of the compounds of formula 1. as erbB kinase inhibitors in intact cells may be determined by the following procedure.   Cells, for example 3T3 cells transfected with human EGFR (Cohen et al. J. Virology 67:5303, 1993) or with chimeric EGFR/erbB2 kinase (EGFR extracellular/erbB2 intracellular, Fazioli et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 11: 2040, 1991) are plated in 96-well plates at 12,000 cells per well in 100 ul medium (Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% pen/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine) and incubated at 37° C, 5% CO2. Test compounds are solubilized in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM, and tested at final concentrations of 0, 0.3 µM, 1 µM, 0.3 uM, 0.1 µM and 10 µM in the medium. The cells are incubated at 37° C for 2 h.   EGF (40 ng/ml final) is added to each well and cells incubate at room temperature for 15 min followed by aspiration of medium, then 100 ul/weil cold fixative  (50% ethanol/50% acetone containing 200 micromolar sodium orthovanadate) is added.  The plate is incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing with wash buffer (0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline). Blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin,  0.05% Tween 20, 200 µM sodium orthovanadate in phosphate buffered saline, 100 µl/well) is added followed by incubation for 2 hours at room temperature followed by two washes with wash buffer. PY54 monoclonal   anti-phosphotyrosine antibody directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase    (50 µl/well, 1  jig/ml in blocking buffer) or blocked conjugate (1 µg/ml with 1 mM phosphotyrosine in blocking buffer, to check specificity) is added and the plates incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate wells are then washed 4 times with wash buffer.   The colorimetric signal is developed by addition of TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD), 50 µl per well, and stopped by the addition of 0.09 M sulfuric acid, 50 µl per well. Absorbance at 450 nM represents phosphotyrosine content of proteins. The increase in signal in EGF-treated cells<br>
over control (non-EGF treated) represents the activity of the EGFR or EGFR/chimera respectively. The potency of an inhibitor is determined by measurement of the concentration of compound needed to inhibit the increase in phosphotyrosine by 50% (IC50) in each cell line. The selectivity of the compounds for erbB2 vs. EGFR is determined by comparison of the IC50 for the EGFR transfectant vs. that for the erbB2/EGFR chimera transfectant. Thus, for example, a compound with an ICS0 of 100 nM for the EGFR transfectant and 10 nM for the erbB2/EGFR chimera transfectant is considered 10-fold selective for erbB2 kinase.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration.<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration and the judgement of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex™ (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as Casodex™ (4'-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository.   The<br>
pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as.sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
The examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing such compounds. It is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations. In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture. Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Where HPLC chromatography is referred to in the preparations and examples below, the general conditions used, unless otherwise indicated, are as follows. The column used is a ZORBAX™ RXC18 column (manufactured by Hewlett Packard) of 150 mm distance and 4.6 mm interior diameter. The samples are run on a Hewlett Packard-1100 system. A gradient solvent method is used running 100 percent ammonium acetate /acetic acid buffer (0.2 M) to<br>
100 percent acetonitrile over 10 minutes. The system then proceeds on a wash cycle with 100 percent acetonitrile for 1.5 minutes and then 100 percent buffer solution for 3 minutes. The flow rate over this period is a constant 3 mL/ minute.<br>
In the following examples and preparations, "Et" means ethyl, "AC" means acetyl, "Me" means methyl, "ETOAC" or "ETOAc" means ethyl acetate, "THF" means tetrahydrofuran, and "Bu" means butyl.<br>
