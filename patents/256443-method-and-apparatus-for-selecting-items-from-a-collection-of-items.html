METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SELECTING ITEMS FROM A<br>
COLLECTION OF ITEMS<br>
The present invention relates to computer processing of information, and more particularly, to computer processing of hems such as artists, songs, movies, pictures, television shows, and news stories.<br>
When using a computer system, a user may desire to select items from a number of hems. For instance, a user might wish to select a playlist of songs from his or her repository of songs. The selected songs could then be played.<br>
When the repository is small, selecting a playlist is quite easy, as there are not that many choices. As the number of songs in the repository grows, however, selecting a playlist can become problematic. For instance, for someone having hundreds or even thousands of songs, h can be hard to remember which songs from which artists are available. Additionally, the process of selecting an artist then selecting a song by that artist can be laborious when a user wants a playlist from multiple artists, especially if the artists and songs are stared in directory structures that have to be perused.<br>
New multimedia programs have helped this process. As an example, certain new multimedia programs can categorize hems into media libraries that can then be searched or organized. Additionally, multiple playlists can be saved in the media libraries.<br>
Nevertheless, there are instances when it would be beneficial for a computer system to select hems for a user. As an example, when a user is playing a song and would like to hear similar songs, h would be beneficial for a computer system to determine and display the titles of similar songs for the user. A need therefore exists for improved methods and apparatus for selecting hems, such as digitally stored songs, from a list of hems, so that, for instance, hems similar to a pre-selected hem may be presented to a user.<br>
Furthermore, a user typically uses an interface when determining what songs to select When a computer system is going to select songs for the user, the user would like to have some control over what songs are selected. It would be beneficial if the controls for such an interface are simple and relatively easy to understand, yet provide a degree of control over how similar songs are determined.<br>
Generally, methods and apparatus are disclosed that select hems from a number of hems.<br><br>
In an exemplary aspect of the invention, techniques are presented for selecting one or more items from a collection of hems. To select the one or more items, an interface is provided that is adapted to allow a user to define one or more weights. Each weight corresponds to one of a number of similarity criteria. Each hem also corresponds to the number of similarity criteria. The one or more weights define a similarity function. The similarity function is applied to fee one or more similarity criteria corresponding to the one or more weights and to each of the set of hems in order to select the one or more hems from fee collection of hems.<br>
Thus, a user can define a similarity function, which can be used to select items of interest to the user.<br>
In another aspect of fee invention, a user selects a predetermined item of the collection of hems. In order to determine hems deemed similar to fee predetermined item, a similarity value is determined for a given hem. The similarity value represents a similarity of fee given hem wife fee predetermined item. The determination of fee similarity value uses values for each of one or more similarity criteria corresponding to both the given hem and fee predetermined hem. The step of determining a similarity value is repeated until similarity values for each of fee plurality of hems other than fee predetermined hem have been determined. This allows a user to be, for instance, presented wife hems similar to fee predetermined item.<br>
A weight may also be determined for each of a number of similarity criteria. The determination of fee similarity value can use a combination of weighted values for each of fee similarity criteria corresponding to both fee given hem and fee predetermined hem. The weighted values are determined using the weights and fee values of fee one or more similarity criteria.<br>
Similarity values may be determined by histograms of similarity criteria, where fee histograms correspond to artists, for instance, such as song writers, television actors, or movie producers.<br>
The hems can be, for instance, artists, songs, movies, pictures, television shows, and news stories. Items can be selected based on corresponding values of fee similarity values and fee selected hems can be presented to a user. The similarity criteria can be, for instance, item names (e.g., song names), artist names, activity periods, tempos (e.&amp;, of songs or movies), distributions of song features, beat strengths, genre names, style names,<br><br>
sounds, moods, topics, and director names.<br>
In another exemplary aspect of the invention, an interface region comprises two or more dimensions and is displayed to a user. Markers are located on the interface region and correspond to similarity criteria. Locations on the interface region are determined for the markers. A weight is determined for each of the markers based on a corresponding location of a given marker. Additionally, each weight can be determined based on a distance between the given marker and a predetermined location of the interface region. The determined weights can be used when determining the similarity values.<br>
In another exemplary aspect of the invention, the markers on the interface region are used to modify weights for the similarity criteria to automatically generate a list of songs or other hems. The weight for each criterion can be determined by computing the distance between the given marker and a predetermined location of the interface region. The weights of the similarity criteria can determine the number of hems, in the automatically generated list, desired by the user for those specific similarity criteria. Thus, the user can have a high degree of control over hems in the list, without ever selecting a predetermined hem.<br>
A more complete understanding of the present invention, as well as further features and advantages of the present invention, will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description and drawings.<br>

As described above, there are problems with selecting items from a number, e.g., collection, of hems. For example, consider the task of manually compiling a playlist of songs. With conventional navigation software, the user selects first the artist, then the album, and eventually the song desired- The process is repeated for each song the user wants to include in the playlist This does not seem problematic, as it can be clear to the user what music should be in the playlist However, some people can download so many songs that they arc not sure what songs are in their collections. Moreover, even if a user knows all the music in his or her collection, it can be laborious to create playlists, especially if the user wants to vary songs in playlists frequently.<br>
In general, playlists are not arbitrary collections of music. Instead, the music is to some extent coherent with some parameters mentally chosen by the user. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention describe methods and apparatus to help the user build a coherent playlist by presenting to the user relevant information (e.g., similar artists or similar songs) based on an item (e.g., a selected song) selected by the user.<br>
As used herein, an "hem" is any type of electronically realizable data, such artists, song, a movie, a picture, a television show, and a news stay, or identifiable portions or combinations thereof. The present disclosure describes exemplary embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention in teems of songs and playlists of songs. However, the present invention can be applied to other types of items.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 1, a computer system 5 is shown operating in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Computer system 5 comprises a display 50, one or more processors 30, and a memory 40, coupled by bus 60. Memory 40 comprises an hem database 45 having similarity criteria tables 25, media 27 having one or more programs 28, and a selection and interface process 29. The display 50 is displaying an interface 100. Interface 100 comprises a browse area 101, a similar area 125, an interface region 150, a rewind button 135, a play button 140, a fast forward button 145, and a playlist 155. Browse area 101 comprises a genre button 105, an artist button 110, an album button 115, and a song button 120. The selection and interface process 29 contains instructions suitable for instructing the one or more processors 30 to cany out some or all of the methods of the present invention. Parts or all of the selection and interface process 29 may be formed, as is known in the art, into one or more programs 28 cm media 27. The media 27 can be a program product, such as a compact disk or other storage devices, suitable for holding the one or more programs 28 used to form the selection and interface process 29.<br>
As described in more detail below, the selection and interface process 29 will provide similar items based on an item selected by the user of the computer system 5 and by similarity criteria selected by the user. In the present disclosure, an hem selected by a user and used to determine similar items will be called a "predetermined item" in order to distinguish this hem from hems selected by the selection and interface process 29. The selection and interface process 29 may be divided into multiple processes, if desired. For example, one process could select items similar to a predetermined hem, while one process could operate the interface 100.<br>
In FIG. 1, the browse area 101 is selected, as is artist button 110. Artist button 110 causes the playlist 155 to show entries 130 that are artists, in this example, in alphabetical order. Thus, FIG. 1 shows the interface 100 operating in "standard" mode. On the left, there is a list of artists, in entries 155, that have been chosen using standard hierarchical navigation method based on artist Genre 105, album 115, and song 120 may also be used to select entries 130 in playlist 155. When the user is selecting artists 110 or songs 120 (for example), the similar area 125 is shown.   When the similar area 125 is<br><br>
selected (e.g., by clicking on the similar area 125 with a pointer), the interface 100 shows on the left a list of similar artists to those previously selected by the user, as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the interface 100 of FIG. 1 after the similar area 125 has been selected. The interface region 150 comprises a number of markers 220, each of which corresponds to a similarity criterion 225. The interface region 155 in this example comprises concentric rings 210. The similar area 125 further comprises a songs button 205. The user originally had two predetermined artists 228 (Marvin Gaye) and 229 (Ry Cooder) selected. The predetermined artists 228,229 are associated with the bulls-eye 215.<br>
Illustratively, the similarity criteria table 260 comprises a sound criterion 265-1, a year criterion 265-2, a mood criterion 265-3, and a genre criterion 265-4. The similarity criteria tables 270 and 280 also comprise similarity criteria 275 and 285, respectively. The similarity criteria 265, 275 and 285 are predetermined by some entity, which could be experts, the user, or a computer system (e.g^ through electronic analysis). This means that the user is given a choice of similarity criteria 225 and typically cannot add new similarity criteria 225. However, provisions could be made fix- the user to add a new similarity criterion 225, if the user can also provide a method to compute the similarity between two items on the basis of this new similarity criterion.<br>
Year criteria 265-2,275-2, and 285-3 can be, for example, the years in which the artist was active (e.g., from 1982 to 1987). The mood criteria 265-3,275-3, and 285-3 might be light, romantic, happy, sad, upbeat, or the like. Sound criteria can be based on the analysis of the spectrum of the songs performed by the artists such as that described in Music Summarization System and Method, U.S. Patent No. 6,633,845, October 14, 2003, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Genre criteria 265-4,275-4 and 285-4 can be, fin- instance, jazz, classical, rode, hard rock, rap, popular, teen, en- some combination thereof.<br>
Together with the playlist 155 of similar artists, a number of similarity criteria 225 are shown on the right part of theinterfece 100. Weights 290 can be adjusted by the user for similarity criteria 225 by moving associated markers 220 of the similarity criteria 225 closer or farther from the bulls-eye 215. By changing the relative position of the markers 220 of the similarity criteria 225, the user changes how similarity values are computed as described below. The weights 290 define a similarity function, which may comprise a vector of one or more of the weights. The similarity function is applied to the<br><br>
similarity criteria 225 in order to select similar items. Therefore, the similarity function is user-definable and defines similarity values for items, where the items can be selected by using the values. An appropriate list of similar artists is determined on the left in playlist 155. Thus, the interface 100 provides a degree of control for fee user over what similar artists (or other hems) are presented to the user.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, an interface distance 227 is determined for each marker 220. The interface distance 227 is a number determined by determining a distance from a marker 220 to the bulls-eye 215. Bulls-eye 215 is a location in this example but can also be a point on the interface region 150. As there are concentric rings 210 in the interface region 150, each concentric ring 210 could be assigned a particular interface distance 227. For instance, the marker 220-1 for the criterion sound 225-1 could have an assigned interface distance 227-1 of three, the marker 220-1 for the criterion year 225-2 could have an assigned interface distance 227-2 of five, and the criterion mood 225-3 could have an interface distance 227-3 of one. Thus, the concentric rings 210-1, 210-2, 210-3,210-4,210-5, and 210-6 could have assigned interfece distances 227 of six, five, four, three, two, and one, respectively. Additionally, a marker can be placed on or in bulls-eye 215, so the bulls-eye 215 could be assigned an interface distance 227 of zero. Alternatively, linear distance on the interface region 150 could be used to assign an interfece distance 227. Therefore, the interface distance 227-1 could be assigned a value of one inch, while the interface distance 227-2 could be assigned a value of 1.8 inches.<br>
The interface distances 227-1, 227-2, 227-3, and 227-4 are converted to weights wi 290-1, w2 290-2, w3 290-3, and w4 2904, respectively. The weights 290 are used to modify unweighted similarity criteria, such as similarity criteria 265,275 and 285, when determining which artists (in the example of FIG. 2) are similar to one or both of the artists 228,229. Tht mood similarity criterion 225-3 is positioned by the user (e.g^ by positioning the corresponding marker 220-3 close to die bulls-eye 215) so that this similarity criterion is weighted higher than the similarity criteria 225-1 and 225-2.<br>
Dlustratively, the concentric rings 210-1, 210-2, 210-3, 210-4, 210-5, and 210-6 could have assigned interface distances 227 of six, five, four, three, two, and one, respectively. The interfece distances 227 of six, six, five, four, three, two, and one could be converted to weights 290 of zero, one, two, three, four, five, and six, respectively. Additionally, a marker can be placed on or in bulls-eye 215, so the bulls-eye 215 could be<br><br>
assigned an interface distance 227 of zero and a corresponding weight of seven. It should be noted that locations of the markers 220 can be converted directly to weights 290, if desired. Also, weights could be less than or equal to one, if desired, such that a weight of one equates with a marker 220 being cm the bulls-eye 215 (for instance), while each concentric ring 210 would differ by 0.167 (e.g., ring 210-6 would have an assigned weight of 0.833). It should be noted that the weights could be assigned non-linearly, so that a distance of 0 .5 indies could be assigned a value of 10 (for example), while interface distances on the interface region ISO of 1.0 and 1.5 indies could be assigned a value of one and 0.1, respectively.<br>
As explained in reference to FIG. S, the weights 290 are used when determining a similarity value used to select similar artists (in the example of FIG. 2). For instance, for the artist Madonna A an exemplary similarity measure with another artist B would be the following:<br>
s(A*B) = s(s(nmdA9soundB\s(yearA9yearB\s(moodA,moodB)9      (1)<br>
where each s(-) is a similarity function that uses a corresponding weight 290, and s^B) is a similarity value produced by the similarity measure of Equation 1. Alternatively, fee s{-)<br>
could be modified by a corresponding weight, as shown below in reference to FIG. 5. Typically, the entries are presented in a descending order, so that the entry "George Michael" is more similar than the entry "Madonna" to the predetermined songs 228, 229. However, descending order (or any order) is not necessary. Additionally, generally only a number of most similar (e.g., as determined by the similarity measure of Equation 1) hems, such as artists or songs, will be shown in the playlist of interface 100. For example, fee top 10 most similar hems can be displayed Nonetheless, all items could be displayed (with accompanying similarity value, if desired).<br>
Although the interface region ISO is shown having two dimensions, it should be noted that the interface region ISO could also have more or fewer dimensions, e.g., three dimensions.<br>
It should also be noted that, in another exemplary embodiment, the playlist 155 of similar artists can be displayed (e.g., instead when clicking the similar area 125) at any time the user selects one or more artists, and that the criteria for similarity can be<br><br>
displayed contractually to the playlist 155 or used as user preference and showed only at user request<br>
Turning now to FIG. 3, another example of fee interface 100 of FIG. 1 is shown after a similarity operation has been performed, using similarity criteria 325, to determine similar songs to a predetermined song. In this example, the song 329, "Baba," was used as a predetermined item, e.g., to define the similarity criteria associated with the bulls-eye 215. The similarity criteria 327 are sound 327-1, tempo 327-2, mood 327-3, and year 327-4. The tempo criterion 327-2 can be determined through computer analysis, expert opinion, or user opinion. The corresponding interface distances 327-1 through 327-4 are determined illustratively by comparing markers 325-1 through 325-4 with bulls-eye 215. Corresponding weights (not shown in FIG. 4) are determined for the interface distances 327-1 through 327-4. Alternatively, the locations of the markers 320 can be used to determine the interface distances 327.<br>
Using the markers 320, set by the user for the similarity criteria 325, the system 100 (see FIG. 1) has determined that the playlist 155 comprises entries 330. In the example of FIG., 3, the playlist 155 comprises songs in entries 330.<br>
One of the advantages of selecting artists or songs, as in FIGS. 2 and 3 respectively, is in how easy it is for a user to weight the similarity criteria 225 or 325 and in the perception of control that the user receives with respect to a system where the definition of similarity is not used.<br>
FIG. 4 is another example of the interface shown in FIG. 1. In this case, the criteria 425 are not similarity criteria, but selection criteria which may be selected by the iiser from the available genres, artists, and albums. In the example, the user has selected artists Michael Jackson 425-2 and Marvin Gaye 425-3 and genres Soul + R&amp;B + Rap 425-1 as selection criteria 425 to generate the playlist In the example, Michael Jackson 425-2 is weighted more (closer to the bulls-eye 415) than Marvin Gaye 525-3. This can be seen by interface distances 427-2 and 427-3, respectively. Genres Soul + R&amp;B + Rap 425-1 is weighted more than Marvin Gaye 425-3, as shown by interface distances 427-1 and 427-3, respectively. In this example, weighting is based on interface distance (e.g., and not based on having a marker 420 occur in a concentric ring). The criteria can be positive respectively shown in 430-2,430-3, 430-1 or negative. Two other criteria can be selected by the user<br><br>
year 445 (between year 450-1,1970, and year 450-2,1980, in this example) and tempo 460 (between a tempo 465-1 of zero and a tempo 465-2 of two).<br>
On the basis of Hie selected criteria, a playlist 430 can be generated using a selection function which schedules the songs into a playlist (of duration determined by the user), e.g., from all songs in the user's collection. See, for example, international application WO 2004/057495, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, wherein constraint satisfaction is used to select hems for a playlist See also, for example, European Patent No. 1,193,616 entitled "Fixed-Length Sequence Generation of Items Out of a Database Using Descriptors," (hereinafter, EP119616), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. EP119616 discloses conventional methods for playlist generation, for example, EP119616 discloses a method of generating sequencing information representing a sequence of hems selected in a database, each of the hems comprising a set of descriptors, characterized in that the method comprises the steps of: a) specifying a length of said sequence and at least one of said descriptors; b) applying similarity relation techniques between said hems; and c) generating a fixed-length sequence -having a morphological continuity. The weights for the similarity criteria 425 can be used, for instance, when applying similarity relation techniques to the herns (e.g., described by similarity criteria tables for the hems). The similarity criteria are thus constraints and are weighted by weights in a user-defined similarity definition. The fixed-length sequence would then be used to select similar hems.<br>
Other selection criteria such as album names can also be used. FIG. 4 also shows an additional menu 440 to the user to save, load, flip, or reset similarity criteria.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment, a playlist 430 is generated using a user interface similar to, for example, interface region 150 in FIG. 1. For example, interface region 500, shown in FIG. 5, consists of a set of concentric circles having different radii, but the same origin. A user of interface region 500 can, at his or her discretion, place playlist markers), e.g., playlist marker 502, in this set of circles.<br>
According to this embodiment, each playlist marker comprises a structure with three parameters. First, each playlist marker has at least one polar coordinate expressed in an inverted normalized radial component r between 1.0 and 0.0 and an angle component phi. Second, each playlist marker has a song attribute value attached to it Third, a sign, e.g., sign 504, indicating whether songs with the given attached song attribute value should be<br><br>
present in the playlist (eg., a '+' indicating the song should be in 'the playlist and a '-' indicating the song should not be in the playlist) is attached to each playlist marker.<br>
When a single playlist marker is present, such as single playlist marker 502, the inverted normalized radial distance, e.g., (J -r), of the playlist marker to the origin represents the desired cardinality of the attached song attribute value. The angle component of die playlist marker has no effect on the playlist generation.<br>
Using this method, inner circle 506 of interface region 500 represents desired cardinalities between 100 percent and 80 percent, circle 508 of interface region 500 represents desired cardinalities between 80 percent and 60 percent, circle 510 of interface region 500 represents desired cardinalities between 60 percent and 40 percent, circle 512 of interface region 500 represents desired cardinalities between 40 percent and 20 percent and outer circle 514 of interface region 500 represents desired cardinalities between 20 percent and zero percent<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, a desired cardinality of about 70 percent popular music is requested. Thus, the remaining 30 percent is left unspecified. It is important to note that sign 504 presents a'+.' If; however, sign 504 had presented a *-,' this would mean that no (e.g., zero percent) popular music is desired, irrespective of the position of playlist marker 502.<br>
In FIG. 6, two playlist markers, e.g., 602 and 604, are present If two playlist markers are present that represent the same criteria (e.g., musical genre), the inverted normalized radial distances of the two playlist markers are compared with each other to arrive at the desired cardinalities. The closer a playlist marker is to the origin (e.g., the smaller the radial distance), the higher the cardinality. Again, the angle components do not have any effect As shown in FIG. 6, the desired cardinalities for popular music and rode music are about 70% and 30%, respectively.<br>
The desired cardinality (in a proportional number so as to have an integer), for example, for rock music is computed according to,<br><br>
wherein each r represents the normalized radial distances.<br>
If playlist markers represent multiple attributes (e.g., musical genres and artists), the hierarchical structure of genre first, then artist, then album and then song is<br><br>
considered to arrive at a value far the desired cardinalities. Specifically, all the desired cardinalities for the genres involved are first calculated. Then fee cardinalities for the artists involved are calculated, and so on. Further, since each artist belongs to a genre, for example, Pink Floyd belongs to fee genre rock, if fee cardinality for an artist, such as Pink Floyd, is at least five, then the cardinality for fee genre rode is also at least five.<br>
For example, in FIG. 7, only rock and popular genres and artist Abba are involved, e.g., as represented by markers 702, 704 and 706, respectively. Abba is a group feat recorded popular music. The configuration shown in FIG. 7 reflects that about 70 percent of Abba's music should account for fee popular music in fee playlist, as computed by 1 - r. This means feat about 50 percent of fee complete playlist will be filled wife music by Abba, about 30 percent will be filled wife rock music and about 20 percent will be filled wife popular music from unspecified artists.<br>
In another exemplary configuration, for example, as shown in FIG. 8, another artist, Britney Spears, is added. Thus, fee four markers, 802, 804, 806 and 808 are present representing rock, popular, Abba and Britney Spears, respectively. Since both Abba and Britney Spears belong to the popular genre, their radial distances are compared. As a result, it can be determined that the user desires feat fee playlist contain about 60 percent music by Abba and about 40 percent music by Britney Spears under fee genre popular music and about 30 percent music under fee genre rock music.<br>
In FIG. 9, an additional artist, Queen, is added to fee configuration. Thus, the markers, 902, 904, 906, 908 and 910 are present representing rock, popular, Abba, Britney Spears and Queen, respectively. The addition of Queen to fee playlist only has an effect on fee genre rode music in the playlist Specifically, about 90 percent of fee rode music should be from Queen. The angle component of fee polar position of the markers has no effects on fee cardinality computation, only fee distance from fee origin matters. Therefore, users may group the markers for easy understanding, if so desired.<br>
It is also possible to add an artist in fee configuration feat is not covered by a musical genre. For example, in FIG. 10, fee band Doe Maar, which plays Nederlandstalige music, is added. Thus, the markers 1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, 1010 and 1012 art present representing rock, popular, Abba, Britney Spears, Queen and Doe Maar, respectively. As cardinality propagates up to fee level of genre (eg., as described above, if Britney Spears belongs to fee genre popular, and if at least three songs from Britney Spears are desired, then<br><br>
at least three songs from the genre popular are desired), a phantom playlist marker is created for die genre Nederlandstalige at the same position as Doe Maar marker 1012. Thus, the radial distance of the phantom playlist marker from the origin is about the same as the radial distance for the playlist marker fen* popular music.<br>
Comparing the radial distances of the playlist markers 1012,1004 and 1002, desired cardinalities of about 40 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent for the genres Nederlandstalige, rode and popular, respectively, are determined. About 70 percent of the music in the playlist should be Nederlandstalige music from the band Doe Maar.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 11, an exemplary method 1100 is shown that is used to select hems from a plurality of hems. Method 1100 starts in step 1105 when the similarity criteria is determined for each item. Exemplary similarity criteria have been described above. Typically, a set number of similarity criteria are determined and are available for each item. As described above, optionally a user could add a similarity criterion. In step 1110, values for each of the similarity criteria for each of the hems are determined. This determination can be through user input, computer system analysis, expert input, or through any othertechnique.<br>
After step 1110 has been performed, then each item should have a similarity criteria table having values for each similarity criterion. In step 1113, the user selects an hem, which is called the predetermined hem. Step 1113 is optional. For example, in the • method described above, for example, in reference to FIG. 4, that is no predetermined hem selected. It should be noted that step 1130 may be performed at this point Instep 1115, his determined if markers cm the interface region have ben modified. The first time the interface is run, markers will generally be preassigned, typically so that fee markers have the same weighting, although this is not necessary. If the markers have not been changed (step 1115= NO), then method 1100 waits.<br>
When one or more of die markers have been changed (step 1115s YES), then interface distances are determined between the markers and a cents' point on the interface region in step 1120. In step 1125, the interface distances are weighted and a corresponding similarity function is determined. Typically, step 1125 is performed so that markers nearer the location on the interface region corresponding to the predetermined item have higher weights than markers farther from the location. Note that step 1120 could simply determine a location of a marker (e.g., inside a concentric ring) and step 1125 would then map the<br><br>
location to a weight A similarity function could then be \wl9w2fwt}. It should be noted thai<br>
there might be N similarity criteria, but a similarity function might have less than N values for only the weighted similarity criteria or have zero values for unweighted similarity criteria. Also, the similarity function might be more complex and contain additional information such as similarity criteria references.<br>
In step 1130, unweighted similarity criteria differences are determined, in the example of Equation 1, the difference vector<br><br>
has three entries of unweighted similarity criteria difference for the fth the item as compared to the predetermined ipd) hem. Typically, there are (i-l) unweighted similarity criteria difference tables, one for each hem other than the predetermined hem. In step 1135, corresponding weights are applied using the similarity function to the unweighted similarity criteria differences, which results in this example of a weighted vector of.<br><br>
where wn is the weight corresponding to the sound similarity criterion, w2i is the weight corresponding to the year similarity criterion, and W3i is the weight corresponding to the mood similarity criterion. It should be noted that the weights may be applied to each similarity criterion first, then a difference can be determined, which will result in a weighted vector. Step 1135 is typically performed until all (M) weighted vectors are determined. In step 1140, a similarity value, sh is determined through:<br>
and is determined for each (M) combination of item and predetermined item. Note that the similarity measure can use an absolute value so that only positive values are used. Also, the similarity measures used to determine similarity values shown above are merely exemplary and other similarity measures may be used What is important is that a similarity measure be used that is able to determine similar hems using numeric or non-numeric information.<br>
With N artists in a collection, there are N2 distances. It is not to be assumed that the distance from artist A and artist B would be the same as the distance from artist B and artist A- These distances can be stored into a table, and whenever the user selects an artist, the table may be scanned to find the closest artists. Algorithms to find distances using symbolic data are well known in the art For instance, see Gowda and Diday, "Symbolic<br><br>
Chistaring Using a New Dissimilarity Measure," Pattern Recognition, vol. 24, num. 6, 567-578 (1991) and El-Sonbaty and Ismail, "Fuzzy Clustering for Symbolic Data," IEEE Transaction on Fu22y Systems, vol. 6, num. 2 (1998), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. According to an exemplary embodiment, a similarity of 0.1 is assigned when the two items share the same value, and a similarity of 0.0 is assigned when the two hems have different values (e.g^ if Genre Artist A ■ 'rock,' Genre Artist B * 'rock' and Genre Artist C - 'pop,' then the similarity, with respect to Genre, for Artist A and Artist B is 1.0 and the similarity, with respect to Genre, for Artist A and Artist C is 0.0.<br>
In step 1145, hems are selected. This step could be performed, for example, by ranking the items using the similarity values and selecting a predetermined number of the hems or selecting those items within a predetermined distance of a predetermined item or meeting constraints, as described above in reference to FIG. 4. In step 1150, the hems are presented to the user, such as part of a playlist<br>
It should be noted that if multiple predetermined items are selected, similarity measures can be computed for each of the predetermined items using steps of method 1100.<br>
In method 1100, such as in step 1140, similarity of two artists (according to the sound criterion) can be defined based on the features extracted from their songs. The similarity is defined for each couple of artists. Each song in the collection is processed to obtain feature vectors v* e.g. "standard" Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) could be used. The vc are "whitened" and quantized with a PxQ Self-Organizing map (SOM) as described in Kohonen, T., "Self-Organizing Maps," Springer, New York, 2nd edition, 1995. For each artist A&gt; belonging to the collection, a 2-D histogram, nt .J&gt;XQ-&gt;R9 is<br>
computed by accumulating the response of the SOM to the feature vectors vc of the songs performed by that artist In FIGS. 12A and 12B, the histograms computed for two different artists (Pearl Jam and Abba, respectively) are shown.<br>
For each artist, the histogram can be regarded as a probability distribution of the songs in the feature space. One can define the similarity s(AitAj) between two artists At and Aj as: <br>
where P and Q are values for the number of histogram entries for the X and Y axes, respectively, H(h9k) is a value of a histogram at the point (/*, Jt), and min is a function that<br><br>
produces a minimum value between H,{h,k) and Hj(h9k).  A reason for adopting this<br>
similarity measure is because the similarity measure is computationally cheap. However, note that the framework and the techniques proposed herein do not impose any constraint on the choice of the similarity measure.<br>
The same concept can be used to measure the similarity between two artists based on their mood, for instance. In this case, the histogram for artist A is computed accumulating the mood for each song performed by said artist A. Again, the concept can be extended further to, e.g., year and tempo.<br>
It is to be understood that the embodiments and variations shown and described herein are merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications may be implemented by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. For instance, there could be two locations on the interface region, each location corresponding to a predetermined item.<br><br>
