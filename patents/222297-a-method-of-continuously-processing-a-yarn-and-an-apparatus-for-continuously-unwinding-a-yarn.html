The invention relates to a method of continuously processing a yarn, a method of texturing a synthetic multifilament yarn and an apparatus for continuously unwinding a yarn.<br>
The method and the apparatus for withdrawing a yarn are known and used in textile machines, wherein a feed yarn is treated or processed. In the known method and apparatus, the yarn is continuously withdrawn from a feed yarn package, and fed to the subsequent process. To ensure a continuous process, the trailing yarn end of the feed yarn package is knotted to the leading yarn end of a second feed yarn package, which is named reserve package in the present application. After the feed yarn package is unwound, an automatic transfer occurs to the reserve package, whose yarn is again knotted to a leading yarn end of a further package, so that the process operates continuously. In this process, the knotlike piecings present problem spots in the subsequent processing of the yarn, which can lead to defects in the finished product. In the extreme case, the piecing may separate, so that a yarn break occurs.<br>
During the texturing of a yarn, the yarn undergoes an intensive treatment in the treatment process. In this process, a crimped yarnis produced from a flat yarn. To this end — as is known, for example from EP 0 641 877 — the yarn is twisted and, for purposes of setting, it is thermally treated in its twisted condition. In this process, the piecing between a trailing yarn end of a feed yarn package and a leading yarn end of a second feed yarn package (reserve package) influences the twist distribution, which results in an irregular crimp. In the further processing of the crimped yarn, such defects may lead, for example, to dye imperfections.<br>
It is therefore the object of the invention to create a method and an apparatus of the initially described kind for continuously withdrawing a yarn, which ensure that a yarn of uniform quality is supplied to a subsequent process.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to make available a method and a texturing machine for texturing a synthetic yarn to produce from predetermined feed yarn packages with a flat yarn defined packages of a crimped yarn, which can be associated to the feed yarn package.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is accomplished by a method and a texturing machine of the present invention.<br>
The invention is characterized in that after unwinding the complete feed yarn package, a signal is released. This indicates, for example, to an operator that a transfer of the feed yarn is imminent in the treatment process. Thus, there exists a coordination between the finished or end product and the feed yarn package. The operator can initiate measures to avoid possibly occurring defects resulting from the knotlike piecing in the yarn. To detect the transfer from the feed yarn package to the reserve package, a sensor is used that indicates by signaling the transfer of the yarn from the feed yarn package to the reserve package (yarn transfer).<br>
In this connection, it is basically possible to employ three different variants of the method according to the invention. In a first variant, the yarn advances continuously through the sensor. This sensor is designed and constructed such that upon the passage of the knotlike piecing, which represents the trailing yarn end of the feed yarn package joined to the leading yarn end of the reserve package, the sensor generates a signal. This variant of the method has the advantage that it is possible to scan the yarn irrespective of the location at any desired point in the machine. Likewise, it is possible to use a device of the subsequent process, which detects a process parameter, for example, a yarn tension. In this connection, the discontinuity of the signal is evaluated to indicate the passage of the piecing.<br><br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the method, only a partial length of the yarn passes through the sensor. This length comprises a length of the trailing end of the feed yarn package and a length at the leading yarn end of the reserve package. To this end, the sensor is arranged between the feed yarn package and the reserve package. Since during the unwinding of the feed yarn package, the trailing yarn end thereof and the leading yarn end of the reserve package lie loosely in a loop between the two packages, this variant of the method makes it possible to scan the yarn only directly before the yarn transfer. This minimizes the influence exerted on the yarn by scanning.<br>
A particularly simple and effective embodiment of the invention is provided by another variant of the method. Since the trailing yarn end of the feed yarn package and the leading yarn end of the reserve package are stopped during the unwinding of the feed yarn package, it is possible to use already the movement of a yarn length in the region to signal the yarn transfer. This variant of the method is characterized in particular in that simple apparatus parts are needed for carrying it out. To this end, the yarn length may be inserted, for example, in a sensor, which generates a signal, as soon as the yarn length no longer in contact therewith.<br>
At this point, it should be remarked that it is possible to carry out the method regardless of the design of the sensor. Thus, for example, it is possible to use mechanical, optical, or capacitive sensors, which generate an electrical, mechanical, or pneumatic signal.<br>
To alert an operator of a signal, it is further proposed that the signal activate a signaling device for a visual or acoustic display.<br>
In a particularly advantageous further development of the invention, the signal is supplied to a control unit of the process for purposes of preparing or initiating an<br><br>
intervention in the process. This variant of the method is advantageous in particular in automatic process sequences. It can be realized in that, for example, the empty feed yarn package is replaced with a new package, the leading yarn end of which is knotted to the trailing yarn end of the reserve package. With that, it is likewise possible to document the yarn transfer in that, for example, the position and the time are recorded and stored. These data may form the basis for a further evaluation in quality management.<br>
In processes, wherein the piecing leads to the occurrences of defects, or wherein it is necessary to maintain a coordination between the feed yarn and the finished or end product, the variant of the method according to the present invention will be especially advantageous. In the event of an unanswered signal, the process will be interrupted for a period of time. For example, in a texturing process, a creeled flat yarn is textured during the process and subsequently wound on a package as a crimped yarn. In such machines, a plurality of end packages with crimped yarn is wound from one feed yarn package. To this end, it is necessary that a package doff occur in the takeup. During the package doff, the processed yam is removed as waste in a suction device. The variant of the method according to the invention now permits initiating in such machines a package doff in the takeup in a purposeful manner. The special advantage lies in that it is possible to remove as waste the partial length of the yarn that contains the piecing.<br>
A further advantageous development of the invention provides that in the subsequent process a monitoring mechanism is activated, which detects certain quality parameters for maintaining a uniform quality. This permits initiating a change or interruption of the process in the event of an unacceptable variation of the quality parameter, for example, the yarn tension. It is possible to detect as quality parameters, process parameters, such as, for example, yarn speed, yarn tension, or product parameters, such as, for example, yarn temperature.<br><br>
To ensure a coordination between the yarn of the feed yarn package and the respective product, another variant of the method is especially advantageous. In this variant, the control unit causes a change of the feed yarn package and a recording of the new feed yarn package, when a signal is waiting. To this end, it is possible to activate, for example, a transfer device, which selects a feed yarn package with a certain yarn and transfers it to the place vacated by the unwound feed yarn package. Thus, there exists the possibility of not only coordinating the creeled yarn and end product, but also of relating material-specific occurrences in the process back to the respective initial product. However, the new feed yarn package may also be recorded by manually inputting identifications of the respective feed yarn package. Advantageously, the recording remains stored within the control unit, until the replaced feed yarn package is unwound as a result of the yarn transfer.<br>
It is preferred to employ the invention in processes, wherein a yarn is treated, that subsequently results in an end product in a further treatment process. This enables a method of texturing a synthetic multifilament yarn, which allows an exact specification of the produced package with respect to its initial material related to the feed yarn package. Thus, the method of the present invention is characterized in particular in that it permits producing packages with crimped yarn that hold from the start to the end a yarn of a uniform, high quality. It is possible to treat defects by knotlike piecings individually. Should the monitoring of a quality parameter not indicate an unacceptable variation of the quality parameter by the piecing, the package will be produced without interruption. When a limit value of the quality parameter is exceeded or, in general, when a yarn transfer is signaled, winding of the crimped yarn can be interrupted, for example, by an automatic doff of the package.<br><br>
In the texturing of synthetic yarns, machines are employed, wherein a plurality of processing stations are arranged side by side in tiers. With the use of such machines, it is especially advantageous to employ another variant of the method for texturing the yarn continuously. To this end, each takeup device is associated with two creel positions that accommodate the feed yarn package and the reserve package. The recordings of the feed yarn package and reserve package are linked to the respective creel positions and deposited in the control system, so that based on the now active creel position, the produced package can be exactly specified with respect to the initial material.<br>
Another variant of the method is especially advantageous for sorting the packages. Thus, it is possible to indicate the piecing in the yarn by a winding time and a yarn length, which can be attached to the package, for example, as a data printout.<br>
In the case that a plurality of packages is produced from one feed yarn package, it is preferred to employ another variant of the method. In this instance, each package that is produced from one feed yarn package is provided with an identification. When a yarn transfer is signaled, the identification is changed for the following packages, since they are produced from a different feed yarn. With that, it is possible to trace the crimped yarn back to the spinning process, in which the flat yarn was produced.<br>
A further categorization of produced packages can be realized in that the package containing the yarn transfer and, thus, the piecing receives an additional identification. Such a categorization is especially advantageous to distinguish in weaving between warp yarn and weft yarn packages.<br>
The identification may occur in a simple manner by a numbering that is restarted after each yarn transfer.<br><br>
For carrying out the method of the present invention, an apparatus or a texturing machine according to this invention is used. The apparatus of the present invention, is characterized in that it facilitates successive processing of even different yarns in one process without a major interruption. To this end, a sensor is provided that detects and signals the transfer of the yarn from the feed yarn package to the yarn of the reserve package.<br>
To arrange the sensor in the apparatus for scanning the yarn, basically two different variants of the apparatus according to the invention are possible. Especially preferred is the embodiment of the apparatus in the case of a sensor that scans the yarn continuously. Contrary thereto, it is possible to arrange the sensor between the feed yarn package and the reserve package in the apparatus which is used with preference. In this apparatus, the yarn length that is formed by the trailing end of the feed yarn package and the leading end of the reserve package and remains in a loop between the packages, is scanned in a simple manner in that the sensor detects the movement of the yarn length.<br>
To be able to initiate corresponding measures during the yarn transfer, the sensor connects to a signaling device in the further development.<br>
In the case of automatically proceeding processes, the embodiment of the apparatus is to be preferred.<br>
A texturing machine according to this invention provides likewise a further solution to the underlying problem. Since in the texturing process improvement of the yarn is possible only by a significant intervention in the structure of the yarn, it is necessary to treat separately in particular irregularities in the yarn, as are caused by a knotlike piecing. The texturing machine of the present invention makes it possible to texture and wind a yarn continuously and with uniform quality irrespective of a transfer of the yarn of a reserve package when the feed yarn package is unwound.<br><br>
In this connection, it is preferred to use the embodiment of the texturing machine according to this invention, since the layout arrangement of the sensor are possible in a simple manner. With that, it is no longer necessary to scan the yarn continuously. Only in the case of the yarn transfer, will the yarn length extending with the piecing between the two packages be withdrawn. The movement of the yarn length is detected and signaled by the sensor.<br>
Preferably, such sensors are designed and constructed as yarn detectors, wherein the yarn length is held in an inoperative position, and wherein the movement of the yarn length causes the yarn detector to move to a signaling position and generate a signal. The signaling can be generated in a simple manner by means of a contact switch.<br>
When sensors are used, which continuously scan the yarn optically or mechanically, it will be advantageous to use the embodiment of the texturing machine. A texturing machine according to this invention, wherein the yarn detector comprises a movable yarn guide and a contact switch, the contact switch being activated for generating a signal by the movement of yarn guide from its idle position to its signaling position. A texturing machine according to this invention, wherein the at least one yarn feed system includes a first feed system positioned between the two feed positions and the texturing device, and wherein the sensor is arranged in the path of the yarn downstream of the two feed positions and upstream or downstream of the first feed system, so that the advancing yarn can be continuously scanned.<br>
Thus, it is proposed, among other things, to design and construct the sensor as a yarn tensiometer, which measures the tension on the advancing yarn and generates a signal, when a limit value of the yarn tension is exceeded. In this connection, one assumes that when the yarn transfers from the feed yarn package to the reserve package, the unwinding behavior of the yarn changes for a short time and, thus, leads<br><br>
to a variation in the yarn tension. It is preferred to use this further development of the texturing machine in processes, wherein the actual piecing exerts no significant influence in the further processing of the crimped yarn. To that extent, a signal is generated only in the case of a deviation from a predetermined limit value of the yarn tension.<br>
To alert an operator of a signal visually or acoustically, the sensor of the further development according to another embodiment connects to a signaling device. The signaling device may be in form of a lamp or siren.<br>
To be able to intervene in the process automatically, it is preferred to construct the texturing machine of the present invention.<br>
In this machine, a controller comprises means for detecting, evaluating and outputting quality parameters and means for linking the quality parameters with signals that are dependent on the yarn transfer. The texturing machine of the present invention is thus suited to perform a continuous quality monitoring from the feed yarn package to the wound package, so as to make thus available a high-quality yarn for further processing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of continuously processing a yarn comprising the steps of: providing a yarn feed package and a yarn reserve package, with the trailing end of the yarn feed package joined to the leading end of the yarn reserve package by a piecing, serially withdrawing the yarn from the yarn feed package and the yarn reserve package so that the withdrawn yarn is transferred from the yarn feed package to the yarn reserve package, sensing when the withdrawn yarn is transferred from the feed yarn package to the yarn reserve package and generating a responsive signal, subjecting the withdrawn yarn to a treatment process for texturing, and supplying the signal to a controller to cause a change selected from a change in the treatment process, a change of the feed yarn package and both.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides an apparatus for continuously unwinding a yarn, comprising at least two feed positions, with one of the feed positions accommodating a feed yarn package and the other feed position a reserve package, conveying means for withdrawing the yarn from the feed yarn package and from the reserve package, and with the trailing end of the yarn from the feed yarn package being knotted to the leading end of the yarn from the reserve package, a sensor for detecting and signaling the transfer of the withdrawn yarn from the feed yarn package to the reserve package, and a controller to cause a change selected from a change in a subsequent treatment process, a change of the feed yarn package and both responsive to a signal from the sensor.<br>
In the following, the methods and apparatus are described with reference to some embodiments of a textile machine with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br><br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of an embodiment of a false twist texturing machine with the apparatus of the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic, cross sectional view of a texturing machine according to the invention;<br><br>
Figure 3 is a schematic top view of a creel frame with feed yarn packages; and<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic view of an embodiment of a yarn detector.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a false twist texturing machine.  In this machine, a feed yarn package 2 is inserted in a creel position 8 that is constructed as a mandrel.  From the feed yarn package 2, a yarn 1 is withdrawn by a first feed system 11.  To this end, the yarn 1 advances overhead from the feed yarn package 2 through a yarn guide 10.  The feed system 11 advances the yarn into a false twist texturing zone.  The false twist texturing zone comprises a heating device 12, a cooling device 13 downstream thereof in the path of the yarn, as well as a false twist unit 15.  A second feed system 16 withdraws the yarn 1 from the false twist texturing zone and guides it into a second heating device 17 for an aftertreatment.  At the outlet end of the second heating device 17, a further feed system is provided, which withdraws the yarn from the heating device 17 and advances it to a takeup device downstream thereof.  The takeup device comprises a winding spindle 21, on which a package 20 is wound.  The package 20 is driven by a drive roll 22 in contact therewith.  A yarn traversing device 23 extends in the yarn path upstream of the package 20, The traversing device 23 includes an oscillating yarn guide, which reciprocates the yarn transversely to its direction of advance, so that a cross-wound package is produced.<br>
Laterally next to the feed yarn package 2, a mandrel 9 in a second creel position 9 holds a second feed yarn package, which is designated reserve package 3<br><br>
for purposes of distinguishing it.  The feed yarn package 2 and reserve package 3 may be arranged, for example, in a creel, which accommodates a plurality of feed yarn packages for a plurality of processing stations in the texturing machine. A trailing yarn end 6 of feed yarn package 2 is knotted to a leading yarn end 7 of the reserve package 3, so that a piecing 5 is formed in the yarn.  The partial length of the yarn with the piecing 5 between the feed yarn package 2 and reserve package 3 extends through a sensor 4.  The sensor 4 comprises a signaling line 26, which connects the sensor 4 to a controller 24.  The controller 24 comprises a plurality of outlets 25 for controlling the process of the texturing machine.<br>
In the textile machine shown in -Figure 1, the yarn 1 is continuously withdrawn from the feed yarn package 2 and textured in the false twist texturing zone. In this process, the false twist unit 15 imparts to the yarn 1 a false twist, which is set in the heating device 12 and cooling device 13.  The feed systems 11 and 16 are operated with a speed difference, so that the yarn undergoes simultaneously a drawing in the false twist texturing zone.  After a shrinkage treatment in heating device 17, the yarn 1 is subsequently wound in the takeup device to a package 20.  In such a processy   the yarn from the feed yarn package 2 is successively wound to a plurality of packages 20.  To this end, a package doff is initiated in the takeup device each time after the end diameter of the packages is reached.  While the package 20 is replaced with a new empty tube, the continuously advancing yarn 1 is delivered via a suction device into a waste container until the winding operation continues.<br><br>
The yarn 1 is continuously advanced by feed system 11.  Consequently, a transfer to the yarn of the reserve package 3 will occur after the yarn is unwound from feed yarn package 1./ To this end, the trailing yarn end 6 of feed yarn package 2 and the leading yarn end 7 end of reserve package 3 are knotted to a piecing 5. During the transfer from feed yarn package 2 to reserve package 3, the partial length of the yarn is now likewise withdrawn by feed system 11.  Since the partial length of yarn is scanned in sensor 4, the sensor 4 detects the transfer of the yarn from the feed yarn package 2 to the reserve package 3.  To this end, the sensor may be designed and constructed such that the trailing yarn end 6 and leading yarn end 7 advance through the sensor 4, so that the sensor 4 records the passage of the piecing 5 and converts it into a signal.  However, it is also possible to design the sensor such that is scans exclusively the movement of a yarn length at the trailing yarn end 6 or at the leading yarn end 7.  The signal generated by the sensor 4 is supplied via signaling line 26 to controller 24 to initiate a doff of the packages via the controller 24.  With that, it is possible to avoid advantageously that the partial length of the yarn with piecing 5 is wound on a package.  Furthermore, this permits associating the feed yarn package 2 to the packages wound from the yarn thereof.  To this end, it is possible to identify the last package by labeling, a tie-off wind, or a simple visible marking.<br>
However, it is also possible to wind the partial length of the yarn with piecing 5 on the packages.  The package containing the piecing can then be<br><br>
marked likewise, so as to permit sorting the packages ror final processing, for example by warp and weft materials.<br>
The controller 24 can also be advantageously used for activating a monitoring system for purposefully observing occurrences of defects that are caused in the process by piecing 5.  Likewise, it is possible to evaluate the quality parameters, such as, for example, yarn tension, yarn break, which occurred in the period of time, when the yarn from feed yarn package 2 was processed.  With that it is possible to draw purposefully conclusions as to the quality of the yarn of the feed yarn package.<br>
Furthermore, the controller 24 permits controlling the loading of the creel.  To this end, a new feed yarn package is inserted on mandrel 8 to knot the leading yarn end of the new feed yarn package to the trailing yarn end of the reserve package.<br>
The method of the present invention is described in Figure 1 by way of example with reference to a texturing machine.  However, the method of the invention may be applied to all known textile machines, wherein a yarn advances continuously from a feed yarn package to a treatment process.  Figure 2 shows an embodiment of a texturing machine according to the invention.  In the following description, structural parts with the same function are therefore indicated by identical numerals.<br>
The texturing machine comprises a creel frame 28, a processing frame 29, and a takeup frame 27.  A service aisle 30 extends between the takeup frame 27 and the processing frame 29.  On the side of the takeup frame 27 opposite to the service aisle 30, the creel frame 28<br><br>
is arranged #at a distance from the takeup frame 27. Between the takeup frame 27 and the creel frame 28, a doff aisle 31 is provided for a doffer not shown.  The texturing machine comprises a plurality of processing stations, each of which processes one yarn 1.  The processing stations are parallel to one another.  The takeup devices 32 occupy a width of three processing stations.  Thus, three takeup devices 32.1, 32.2, and 32.3 overlie one another in tiers in the takeup frame 27.<br>
Each takeup device 32 is associated to two creel positions in the creel frame 28, which are formed by mandrels 8 and 9.  The mandrels 8 and 9 mount feed yarn packages 2 and 3.  The feed yarn packages 2.1 and 3.1 are associated to takeup device 32.1, the feed yarn packages 2.2 and 3.2 to takeup device 32.2, and the feed yarn packages 2.3 and 3.3 to takeup device 32.3.  In the following, the yarn advance is described with reference to one processing station.  The trailing yarn end of feed yarn package 2, from which the yarn 1 is just being unwound, is joined to the leading yarn end 7 of reserve package 9 by a knotlike piecing 5.<br>
In each processing station, a first feed system 11 withdraws the yarn 1 from feed yarn package 2 over a yarn guide 10 and a yarn guide 14.1.  Upstream of the feed system 11, a sensor 4 is arranged for- continuously scanning the yarn 1.  The sensor 4 connects via the signaling line 26 to the controller 24.  When viewed in the direction of the advancing yarn, a first heating device 12, a cooling device 13, a false twist unit 15, and a second feed system 16 extend downstream of the first feed system 11.  In the path of the yarn between false twist unit 15 and the second feed system 16, a yarn<br><br>
tension sensor 35 is provided, which the yarn enters via a yarn guide 36.1 and leaves via a yarn guide 36,2. The yarn tensiometer 35 connects to controller 24.<br>
A second heating device 17, a yarn guide 14.3, and a third feed system 18 extend between the takeup device 32 and the second feed system 16.  Between the feed yarn package 2 and the takeup device 32, the yarn 1 advances through a plurality of yarn guides 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3.  Preferably, the yarn guides are constructed as deflection rolls.<br>
In the takeup device32, the yarn is wound to a package 20.  A drive roll 22 drives the package 20. Upstream of drive roll 22, a yarn traversing device 23 extends.  The traversing device 23 reciprocates the yarn 1 along the package 20, thereby causing it to be wound in a cross wind.<br>
The takeup device 32 comprises a package storage 34, which serves to receive full packages 20.  To remove the full packages 20, a winding spindle is pivoted by means of a package support, and the full package is placed on a rollway.  The rollway forms part of the package storage 34.  On the rollway, the full package 20 waits for its removal.  To simplify the removal, the rollway slopes toward the doff aisle 31.  Furthermore, each takeup device 32 comprises a tube feed device 33.<br>
Each takeup device 32 is controllable via a takeup control device 37. The takeup control devices 37.1, 37.2, and 37.3 connect to controller 24.<br>
On the creel frame 28, each processing station is associated to an input unit 38 that connects to controller 24.<br><br>
In the situation of the texturing machine shown in Figure 2, one yarn 1 each is withdrawn from the feed yarn package 2, textured in the false twisting zone, relaxed in the second heating device, and subsequently wound to a package 20.  In this process, the yarn tension is continuously measured by yarn tension sensor 35 for monitoring its quality.  The measured values are supplied to controller 24 for evaluating the process control.<br>
After the feed yarn package is fully unwound, a yarn transfer occurs to the second feed yarn package 3. As soon as the piecing 5 in yarn 1 passes the sensor 4, a signal is supplied via signaling line 26 to controller 24.  The controller 24 is now able to initiate various control measures.<br>
One possibility consists in influencing via the takeup control device 37 the respective takeup device 32 of the affected processing stations in such a manner that the package is doffed.  In this event, the takeup operation is interrupted.  The yarn is cut by means of an auxiliary device not shown and removed via a suction device.  Subsequently, a new tube replaces the package in the takeup device 32.  During the package doff, the yarn length with piecing 5 advances in the suction device to a waste container (not shown).  When the winding operation restarts, the first package will thus be produced from the yarn of feed yarn package 3.  In this process, the takeup control device 37 can simultaneously proceed with a continuous identification of the produced packages that are produced from the yarn of feed package 3.  The identification may include the processing station, a continuous numbering, as well as characteristic data of the feed yarn package.  The characteristic data or the<br><br>
recording of* the feed yarn package 2 or feed yarn package 3 is manually entered via input unit 38.  In this process, an operator registers during the change of the feed yarn package the characteristic data thereof by means of input unit 38 and supplies them to controller 24.  With that, the information about the feed yarn package or the yarn that is creeled and processed, is available for each processing station.<br>
A further possibility of intervening in the process consists in that the controller 24 influences the processing station via takeup control device 37 such that the package that contains the piecing is separately identified.  Since a plurality of packages is produced from one feed yarn package, it is thus possible to effect a purposeful categorization.<br>
Furthermore, the controller can include means, which monitor and evaluate the continuously supplied quality parameters - such as, for example, the yarn tension - upon receipt of a signal from sensor 4.  This means, a package doff will be initiated only, when a predetermined limit value is exceeded.  Likewise, it is possible to eliminate during the quality monitoring deviations caused by piecing 5, which will be of advantage in particular in the case of a long-term quality monitoring.<br>
In the arrangement shown in Figure 2, the sensor 4 precedes, for example, the first feed system 11. The sensor 4 that contains optical or mechanical means to detect the piecing 5, may also be arranged in a different location in the yarn path.<br>
The texturing device of the machine shown in Figure 2, which comprises the false twist unit, the<br><br>
heater, and the cooling device, represents an example. It is also possible to texture the yarn by other means, for example, entanglement nozzles.  The invention also covers such machines.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a further embodiment of a creel frame,35 could be used, for example, in a machine of Figure 1 or Figure 2.  The creel frame comprises a rotatable axle 42, which mounts on its circumference, evenly distributed, three T-shaped supports 41.1. 41.2, and 41.3.  Arranged on the free ends of the T-shaped support are mandrels 8 and 9, which accommodate each one feed yarn package.  In this arrangement, the mandrels 8, 9 may advantageously connect to the support 41 for pivoting thereabout.  Each support 41 accommodates for one processing station a feed yarn package- 2 and a reserve package 3, with adjacent feed yarn packages of adjacent T-shaped supports being associated to one processing station. In the case of this creel, the yarns 1 are withdrawn from their respective feed packages 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 via a yarn guide 10 mounted in the center thereof.  Arranged between the feed yarn package 2 and the reserve package 3 is a yarn detector 39, which operates as a sensor.  The yarn detector 39 receives a yarn length that is formed by the leading yarn end of the reserve package and the trailing yarn end of the feed yarn package.  The yarn detector 39 connects to a signaling device 40, which is a lamp in the present embodiment.  The yarn detector 39 connects likewise to a controller 24.<br>
The arrangement shown in Figure 3 causes the yarn detector 39 to be activated after the feed yarn package 2 is unwound, as will be described below in<br><br>
greater detail.  This activates the signaling device 40. The operator can now immediately recognize, which processing station is ready for a yarn transfer, or which processing station requires a new feed yarn package in the creel.  The linkage to the controller 24 permits an immediate conversion to automatically proceeding measures in the subsequent process.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment of a yarn detector as could be used, for example, in the creel of Figure 3.<br>
Figure 4.1 is a side view and Figure 4.2 a top view of the yarn detector.  The following description will therefore apply to both Figures.  The yarn detector consists of a holder 52 and a movable yarn guide 43.  The holder comprises a groove 47.  In the groove 47, the yarn guide 43 is mounted for pivoting about an axle 44.  The yarn guide is thus able to move between an idle position 49 and a signaling position 50.  In the idle position 49, the yarn guide 43 that is designed and constructed as a bar, contacts in an upright position a stop 51.  In this idle position 49, the yarn guide 43 extends through a guide notch 48 arranged in the holder 52 on both sides of the groove 47.  The yarn 1 extends in guide notch 48, and the yarn guide 43 deflects and secures its at the same time.  By a pivotal movement, the yarn guide 43 is able to reach from its idle position 49 a signaling position 50.  In the signaling position 50, a contact switch 45 is arranged, which is activatable by the contact of yarn guide 43.  The contact switch 45 connects via a signaling line 46 to a signaling device not shown.<br>
In the position of the yarn detector shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, the yarn 1 is clamped.  The yarn<br><br>
length between the feed yarn package and the reserve package is at rest.  When now a transfer of the yarn occurs from the feed package to the reserve package, the yarn 1 is withdrawn from the yarn detector.  This causes the yarn guide 43 to move away from stop 51 to the signaling position.  With that, the contact switch 45 is activated, so that a signal is generated.  The described yarn detector is to be considered an example.  However, the invention is not limited to individual embodiments of sensors, but basically covers all embodiments commonly known to the person of skill in the art, which make it possible to detect a knotlike piecing in the yarn and to qenerate a signal thereafter.<br><br>
