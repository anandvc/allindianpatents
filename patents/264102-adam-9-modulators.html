TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[001] This invention is in the fields of biology and immunotherapy. More<br>
specifically, it concerns discoveries about ADAM-9, a known antigen, and<br>
polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and other agents that bind to this antigen.<br>
The invention further provides methods for the diagnosis and/or treatment of a<br>
variety of human diseases and cancers associated with ADAM-9, using ADAM-9<br>
modulators including agonists and antagonists, and peptides that bind to ADAM-<br>
9, including anti-ADAM-9 antibodies.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] In addition to their known uses in diagnostics, antibodies have been<br>
shown to be useful as therapeutic agents. For example, immunotherapy, or the<br>
use of antibodies for therapeutic purposes has been used in recent years to treat<br>
cancer. Passive immunotherapy involves the use of monoclonal antibodies in<br>
cancer treatments. See for example, Cancer. Principles and Practice of Oncology, 6th<br>
Edition (2001) Chapt. 20 pp. 495-508. These antibodies can have inherent<br>
therapeutic biological activity both by direct inhibition of tumor cell growth or<br>
survival and by their ability to recruit the natural cell killing activity of the body's<br>
immune system. These agents can be administered alone or in conjunction with<br>
radiation or chemotherapeutic agents. Rituximab and Trastuzumab, approved<br>
for treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer, respectively, are<br>
two examples of such therapeutics. Alternatively, antibodies can be used to<br>
make antibody conjugates where the antibody is linked to a toxic agent and<br>
directs that agent to the tumor by specifically binding to the tumor.<br>
Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is an example of an approved antibody conjugate<br>
used for the treatment of leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to cancer<br>
cells and have potential uses for diagnosis and therapy have been disclosed in<br>
publications. See, for example, the following patent applications which disclose,<br>
inter alia, some molecular weights of target proteins: U.S. Patent No. 6,054,561<br><br>
(200 kD c-erbB-2 (Her2), and other unknown antigens 40-200 KD in size) and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,656,444 (50 kD and 55 kD oncofetal protein). Example of antibodies<br>
in clinical trials and/or approved for treatment of solid tumors include:<br>
Trastuzumab (antigen: 180 kD, HER2/neu), Edrecolomab (antigen: 40-50 kD, Ep-<br>
CAM), Anti-human milk fat globules (HMFG1) (antigen &gt;200 kD, HMW Mucin),<br>
Cetuximab (antigens: 150 kD and 170 kD, EGF receptor), Alemtuzumab (antigen:<br>
21-28 kD, CD52), and Rituximab (antigen: 35 kD, CD20).<br>
(003] The antigen targets of trastuzumab (Her-2 receptor), which is used to<br>
treat breast cancer, and cetuximab (EGF receptor), which is in clinical trials for the<br>
treatment of several cancers, are present at some detectable level on a large<br>
number of normal human adult tissues including skin, colon, lung, ovary, liver,<br>
and pancreas. The margin of safety in using these therapeutics is possibly<br>
provided by the difference in the level of expression or in access of or activity of<br>
the antibody at these sites.<br>
[004] In addition to cancer targets, antibody therapeutics have also been shown<br>
to be effective against chronic inflammation and other immune disorders. An<br>
example of an antibody therapeutic approved for treatment of immune<br>
disorders is Infliximab (antigen: TNFa).<br>
[005] Another type of immunotherapy is active immunotherapy, or<br>
vaccination, with an antigen present on a specific cancer(s) or a DNA construct<br>
that directs the expression of the antigen, which then evokes the immune<br>
response in the individual, i.e., to induce the individual to actively produce<br>
antibodies against their own cancer. Active immunization has not been used as<br>
often as passive immunotherapy or immunotoxins.<br>
[006] Several models of disease (including cancer) progression have been<br>
suggested. Theories range from causation by a single infective /transforming<br>
event to the evolution of an increasingly "disease-like" or 'cancer-like' tissue type<br>
leading ultimately to one with fully pathogenic or malignant capability. Some<br>
argue that with cancer, for example, a single mutational event is sufficient to<br>
cause malignancy, while others argue that subsequent alterations are also<br>
necessary. Some others have suggested that increasing mutational load and<br>
tumor grade are necessary for both initiation as well as progression of neoplasia<br><br>
via a continuum of mutation-selection events at the cellular level. Some cancer<br>
targets are found only in tumor tissues, while others are present in. normal<br>
tissues and are up regulated and/or over-expressed in tumor tissues. In such<br>
situations, some researchers have suggested that the over-expression is linked to<br>
the acquisition of malignancy, while others suggest that the over-expression is<br>
merely a marker of a trend along a path to an increasing disease state.<br>
[007] An ideal diagnostic and /or therapeutic antibody would be specific for an<br>
antigen present on a large number of cancers, but absent or present only at low<br>
levels on any normal tissue. The discovery, characterization, and isolation of a<br>
novel antigen that is specifically associated with cancer(s) would be useful in<br>
many ways. First, the antigen could be used to make monoclonal antibodies<br>
against the antigen. An antibody would ideally have biological activity against<br>
cancer cells and be able to recruit the immune system's response to foreign<br>
antigens. An antibody could be administered as a therapeutic alone or in<br>
combination with current treatments or used to prepare immunoconjugates<br>
linked to toxic agents. An antibody with the same specificity but with low or no<br>
biological activity when administered alone could also be useful in that an<br>
antibody could be used to prepare an immunoconjugate with a radio-isotope, a<br>
toxin, or a chemotherapeutic agent or liposome containing a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, with the conjugated form being biologically active by virtue of the<br>
antibody directing the toxin to the antigen-containing cells.<br>
[008} One aspect desirable for an ideal diagnostic and/or therapeutic antibody is<br>
the discovery and characterization of an antigen that is associated with a variety<br>
of cancers. There are few antigens that are expressed on a number of types of<br>
cancer (e.g., "pan-cancer" antigen) that have limited expression on non-cancerous<br>
cells. The isolation and purification of such an antigen would be useful for<br>
making antibodies (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic) targeting the antigen. An<br>
antibody binding to the "pan-cancer" antigen could be able to target a variety of<br>
cancers found in different tissues in contrast to an antibody against an antigen<br>
associated with only one specific type of cancer. The antigen would also be<br>
useful for drug discovery (e.g., small molecules) and for further characterization<br>
of cellular regulation, growth, and differentiation.<br><br>
[009] The ADAMs (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease Domain) are a family of<br>
proteins thought to be important in a wide range of biological processes such as<br>
cell adhesion, cell fusion and proteolysis. In general, they are transmembrane<br>
proteins having homology to snake venom proteins that have the ability to<br>
degrade basement membrane component and bind to integrins, thus disrupting<br>
cell-matrix interactions. Because of the similarity in function to snake venom<br>
proteins, ADAMs are also known as MDC proteins (Metalloprotease-like,<br>
Disintegrin, Cysteine-rich).<br>
[010] MDC9 or ADAM-9 (Meltrin y) is a member of the AD AM/ MDC protein<br>
family. The protein sequence has been described in U.S. Patent Application Nos.<br>
20040091473 and 20020042368. ADAM-9 expression has been found in rat kidney<br>
and also been shown to be up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinomas using<br>
protein microarrays, however the significance of this finding to cancer<br>
progression is unclear. ADAM-9 has also been shown to be involved in the<br>
shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), in the<br>
processing of the amyloid precursor protein, and as a ligand for several<br>
integrins. Although it is highly conserved between mouse, human and Xenopus<br>
and it is widely expressed in different tissues, a knock-out mouse lacking ADAM-<br>
9 shows no evident pathological abnormalities. Polyclonal and monoclonal<br>
antibodies against ADAM-9 have been used in the identification of novel proteins<br>
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in protein arrays (Tannapfel et al., / of<br>
Pathology 2003; 201: 238-49) and also in atherosclerosis models using venous<br>
vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to assay for ADAM-9 expression (Al-<br>
Fakhri et al. / Cellular Biochem (2003)89: 808-823), however the significance of<br>
ADAM-9 as a marker is unclear. This prior art does not teach or suggest ADAM-<br>
9 antibodies as therapeutic agents, or that the expression of ADAM-9 plays a<br>
causative effect in cancer.<br>
[011] What is needed are novel targets on the surface of diseased and/or cancer<br>
cells that may be used to diagnose and treat such diseases and/or cancers with<br>
antibodies and other agents which specifically recognize the cell surface targets.<br>
There exists a further need, based on the discoveries disclosed herein, for novel<br>
antibodies and other agents which specifically recognize targets on the surface of<br><br>
cells that can modulate, either by reducing or enhancing, the disease-promoting<br>
activities of ADAM-9. It is an object of this invention to identify antagonists of<br>
human ADAM-9 that are capable of inhibiting its disease-associated activities. It<br>
is another object to provide novel compounds for use in the assay of ADAM-9,<br>
and for use as immunogens or for selecting anti-human ADAM-9 antibodies.<br>
[012] As will be described in more detail below, the present inventors have<br>
made discoveries concerning the known polypeptide, ADAM-9, which we refer<br>
to herein as KID24, identified as the antigen target of the novel antagonists,<br>
modulators and antibodies provided herein.<br>
[013] All references, publications and patent applications disclosed herein are<br>
hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [014] The invention disclosed herein concerns the discoveries that the known<br>
polypeptide ADAM-9 (also referred to herein as KID24)as shown herein is<br>

that is produced by the host cell line KIDNEY.5.3F2.2G8 deposited on May 2,<br>
2003 at the American Type Culture Collection with a Patent Deposit Designation<br>
of PTA # 5174.<br>
[016] In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of generating monoclonal<br>

the steps of: (a) immunizing a host mammal with an immunogen; (b) obtaining<br>
lymphocytes from the mammal; (c) fusing lymphocytes (b) with a myeloma cell<br>
line to produce a hybridoma; (d) culturing the hybridoma of (c) to produce<br>
monoclonal antibodies; and (e) screening the antibodies to select only those<br>
antibodies which bind to diseased and/or cancerous cells or cell lines but do not<br><br>
bind to non-cancerous or normal cells or cell lines, or bind to normal cells at a<br>
lower level or in a different fashion.<br>
[017] In another aspect, the invention is a method of generating an anti-KID24<br>
antibody comprising culturirtg a host cell encoding such antibody or progeny<br>
thereof under conditions that allow production of the antibody, and purifying<br>
the anti-KID24 antibody.<br>
[018] In another aspect, the invention provides methods of generating any of<br>
the antibodies (or polypeptides) described herein by expressing one or more<br>
polynucleotides encoding the antibody (which may be separately expressed as a<br>
single light or heavy chain, or both a light and a heavy chain are expressed from<br>
one vector) in a suitable cell, generally followed by recovering and/or isolating<br>
the antibody or polypeptides of interest.<br>
[019] In another aspect, the invention is an anti-KID24 antibody or a polypeptide (which may or may not be an antibody) that cdmpetitively inhibits preferential binding of an anti-KID24 antibody to KID24i In'someiembodiments,<br>
the invention is an antibody or a polypeptide (which may or may not be an<br>

[021] In yet another aspect, the invention is a composition comprising KID24<br>
bound by an antibody specific for an epitope of KID24. In one embodiment, the<br>
antibody is anti-KID24. In other embodiments, two or more anti-KID24<br>
antibodies are administered, with such antibodies mapping to two or more<br>
different epitopes on KID24. In some embodiments, the anti-KID24 antibody is<br>
linked to a therapeutic agent or a detectable label.<br>
[022] In another aspect, the invention is an antibody comprising a fragment or a<br>
region of an anti-KID24 antibody. In one embodiment, the fragment is a light<br>
chain of the antibody. In another embodiment, the fragment is a heavy chain of<br><br>
the antibody. In yet another embodiment, the fragment contains one or more<br>

human anti-KID24 antibody. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody<br>
binds to the same or different epitope(s) as other anti-KID24 antibodies.<br>
Generally, a humanized antibody of the invention comprises one or more (one, two, three, four, five, six or fragments thereof) CDRs which are the same and/or<br>
derived from the CDR(s) of the original non-human anti-KID24 antibody. In<br>
some embodiments, the human antibody binds to the same or different<br>
epitope(s) as other anti-KID24 antibodies. In anotheraspect, the invention is a<br>
chimeric antibody comprising variable regions derived from variable regions of<br>
a heavy chain and a light chain of a non-human anti-KID24 antibody and<br>
constant regions derived from constant regions of a heavy chain and a light<br>
chain of a human antibody.<br>
[025] In another aspect, the invention is an isolated polynucleotide that encodes<br>
an antibody mu-anti-KID24 that is produced by a host cell with a deposit number<br>
of ATCC PTA# 5174, or progeny thereof. This invention encompasses antibody<br>
polypeptides having the inherent binding or biological activities of any of the<br>
above-specified antibodies. In another aspect, the invention provides<br>
polynucleotides encoding any of the antibodies (including antibody fragments)<br>
as well as any other polypeptides described herein.<br><br>
[026] In another aspect, the invention is a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising any of the polypeptides (including any of the antibodies described<br>
herein) or polynucleotides described herein, such as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising an anti-KID24 antibody linked to a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent, an antibody comprising a fragment of an anti-KID24 antibody, a<br>
humanized antibody of a non-human KID24 antibody, a chimeric antibody<br>
comprising variable regions derived from variable regions of a non-human anti-<br>
K1D24 antibody and constant regions derived from a human antibody, or a<br>
human antibody with one or more properties of a non-human anti-KID24<br>
antibody, or of the anti-KID24 antibody described herein linked to a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent (such as a radioactive moiety), and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient.<br>
[027] In one aspect, the invention is a composition comprising an. anti-KID24 antibody bound to KID24 present on a diseased or cancerous cell. In preferred embodiments, the cancer cell is selected from the group consisting of kidney,<br>
ovarian, lung, prostate, pancreatic, colon, and breast cancer cells. In some<br>
embodiments, the cancer cell is isolated. In some embodiments, the cancer cell is<br>
in a biological sample. Generally, the biological sample is from an individual,<br>
such as a human.<br>
[028] In another aspect, the invention is a method of diagnosing disease in an<br>
individual by detecting KID24 on cells from the individual, particularly diseases<br>
or disorders associated with inflammatory or autoimmune responses in<br>
individuals. In other aspects of the invention, methods are provided for<br>
modulating inflammatory or autoimmune responses in individuals. Diseases<br>
and conditions resulting from inflammation and autoimmune disorders that may<br>
be subject to treatment using the compositions and methods of the invention<br>
include, by way of illustration and not of limitation, multiple sclerosis, meningitis,<br>
encephalitis, stroke, other cerebral traumas, inflammatory bowel disease<br>
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, myasthenia gravis, lupus,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, acute juvenile onset diabetes, AIDS dementia,<br>
atherosclerosis, nephritis, retinitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial<br>
ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury.<br><br>
[029] Still other indications for therapeutic use of antibodies and other<br>
therapeutic agents of the invention include administration to individuals at risk<br>
of organ or graft rejection. Over recent years there has been a considerable<br>
improvement in the efficiency of surgical techniques for transplanting tissues and<br>
organs such as skin, kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas and bone marrow.<br>
Perhaps the principal outstanding problem is the lack of satisfactory agents for<br>
inducing immunotolerance in the recipient to the transplanted allograft or organ.<br>
When allogeneic cells or organs are transplanted into a host (i.e., the donor and<br>
donee are different individuals from the same species), the host immune system<br>
is likely to mount an immune response to foreign antigens in the transplant<br>
(host-versus-graft disease) leading to destruction of the transplanted tissue.<br>
[0301 In another aspect, the invention is a method for diagnosing whether an<br>
individual has cancer, comprising determining whether there is expression of<br>
KID24 on selected cells from the individual, wherein the expression of KID24 on<br>
said cells is indicative of said cancer. In some embodiments, the expression of<br>
KID24 is determined using an anti-KID24 antibody. In some embodiments, the<br>
method involves detecting the level of KID24 expression from cells. The term<br>
"detection" as used herein includes qualitative and/or quantitative detection<br>
(measuring levels) with or without reference to a control.<br>
[031] In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of diagnosing cancer in an<br>
individual by detecting KID24 on or released from cells from the individual,<br>
wherein the cancer is selected from the group including but not limited to<br>
adrenal gland tumors, AIDS-associated cancers, alveolar soft part sarcoma,<br>
astrocytic tumors, bladder cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell<br>
carcinoma), bone cancer (adamantinoma, aneurismal bone cysts,<br>
osteochondroma, osteosarcoma), brain and spinal cord cancers, metastatic brain<br>
tumors, breast cancer, carotid body tumors, cervical cancer, chondrosarcoma,<br>
dhordoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, colon cancer,<br>
colorectal cancer, cutaneous benign fibrous histiocytomas, desmoplastic small<br>
round cell tumors, ependymomas, Ewing's tumors, extraskeletal myxoid<br>

cancer, thymic carcinoma, thymoma, thyroid metastatic cancer, and uterine<br>
cancers (carcinoma of the, cervix, endometrial carcinoma, and leiomyoma).<br>
[032] 111 another aspect, the invention is a method for aiding diagnosis of cancer<br>
(such as but not limited to kidney, ovarian, lung, prostate, pancreatic, colon, or<br>
breast cancer) in an individual comprising determining the expression of KID24<br>
iii a biological sample from the individual. In some embodiments, the expression<br>
of KID24 is determined using an anti-KID24 antibody. In some embodiments,<br>
the method is detecting the level of KID24 expression from cells. The KID24<br>
released from the cancer may contribute to elevated levels of KID24 or a portion<br>
thereof, being detectable in body fluids (e.g., blood, salivary or gut mucinous<br>
secretions).<br>
[033] In yet another aspect, the invention is a method of treating cancer by<br>
administering an effective amount of an antibody that binds to KID24 sufficient<br>
to reduce growth of cancerous cells. In some embodiments, the antibody is an<br>
anti-KID24 antibody. In certain embodiments, the cancerous cells are selected<br>
from the group including but not limited to adrenal gland tumors, AIDS-<br>
associated cancers, alveolar soft part sarcoma, astrocytic tumors, bladder cancer<br>
(squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma), bone cancer<br>

as radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery. In certain preferred embodiments, the<br>
primary tumor has been subjected to at least one round of surgery, radiation,<br><br>

properties of the named antibody. In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic<br>
agent (such as a toxin or a radioactive molecule) is delivered into the cancer cells<br>
(is internalized). In some embodiments, the agent is saporin.<br>

[039] The present invention further provides methods for modulating, either by<br>
enhancing or reducing, the association of KID24 with a cytoplasmic signaling<br>
partner. The association of K3D24 with a cytoplasmic signaling partner can be<br>
impacted by contacting a KID24 molecule presenting on a cell surface, with an<br>
agent that modulates the binding of the signaling partner to KID24. Agents<br><br>
which .block or reduce KID24 association with its binding and/or signaling<br>
partners can be used to modulate biological and pathological processes which are<br>
involved in KID24-mediated inflammation or immune responses. Pathological<br>
processes involving this action include tumor-associated cell growth.<br>
[040J Agents can be tested for their ability to block, reduce, enhance or<br>
otherwise modulate the association of KID24 with a binding partner, such as an<br>
anti-KID24 antibody. Specifically, an agent can be tested for the ability to<br>
modulate such an interaction by incubating a peptide comprising the KID24<br>
interaction site (typically in its native conformation as it exists on intact living<br>
cells) with a binding partner and a test agent, and determining whether the test<br>
agent reduces or enhances the binding of the binding partner to the KID24<br>
peptide.<br>
[041] Agonists, antagonists, and other modulators of K1D24 function are<br>
expressly included within the scope of this invenrfdrt: These agonists, antagonists<br>
and modulators are polypeptides that comprise one or more of the antigenic<br>

/[. Definitions<br>
[050] "KID24" refers to that novel polypeptide antigen with a molecular weight<br>
of approximately 75kDa (under reducing conditions) against which the<br>
antibodies of the present invention, are directed. The KID24 antigen is a cell<br>
surface protein bound by anti-KID24 antibodies and present on pancreas and<br>
several types of carcinomas. This antigen may have more than one different<br>
epitope, and some embodiments of this invention comprise KID24 modulators<br>
that are directed against one of two or more specific epitopes of the KID24<br>
antigen. It is currently believed that KID24 may be over-expressed in certain<br>
cancer cells in comparison to their normal tissue counterparts.<br>
[0511 Agonists, antagonists, and other modulators of KID24 function are<br>
expressly included within the scope of this invention. These agonists, antagonists<br>
and modulators are polypeptides that comprise one or more of the antigenic<br>
determinant sites in KID24, or comprise one or more fragments of such sites,<br>
variants of such sites, or pepudomimetics of such sites. These agonistic,<br>
antagonistic, and KID24 modulatory compounds are provided in linear or<br>
cyclized form, and optionally comprise at least one amino acid residue that is not<br>
commonly found in nature or at least one amide isostere. These compounds<br>
may be glycosylated.<br>
[052] More specifically, the term "KID24 modulator" as used herein is defined<br>
as any compound that (1) is capable of disrupting or blocking the interaction<br>
between human KID24 and its native ligands or an anti-KID24 antibody; (2) is<br>
capable of binding to human KID24 and its native ligands or an anti-KID24<br><br>
antibody; (3) contains an antigenic site that can be used in the raising of<br>
antibodies capable of binding to human KID24 and its native Iigands or an anti-<br>
KID24 antibody; (4) contains an antigenic site that can be used in the screening of<br>
antibodies capable of binding to human KID24 and its native Iigands or an anti-<br>
KID24 antibody; (5) contains an antigenic site that an be used in the raising of<br>
antibodies capable of disrupting or blocking the interaction between human<br>
KID24 and its native Iigands or an anti-KID24 antibody; (6) contains an antigenic<br>
site that can be used in the screening of antibodies capable of disrupting or<br>
blocking the interaction between human. KID24 and its native Iigands or an anti-<br>
KID24 antibody. KID24 modulators may be "KID24 agonists" or "KID24<br>
antagonists" depending on whether their activity enhances or inhibits normal<br>
KID24 biological activity, respectively.<br>
[053J KID24 agonists, antagonists and modulators include KID24 variants,<br>
KID24 peptide antagonists, peptidomimetics, and small molecules, anti-KID24<br>
antibodies and immunoglobulin variants, amino acid variants of human KID24<br>
including amino acid substitution, deletion, and addition variants, or any<br>
combination thereof, and chimeric immunoglobulins. The KID24 agonists,<br>
antagonists and modulators of this invention are based on the inventors'<br>
identification of the KID24 domains involved in the binding of human KID24 to<br>
its native Iigands or anti-KID24 antibodies. Thus, the invention provides KID24<br>
agonists, antagonists and modulators with molecular structures that duplicate or<br>
mimic one or more of the anti-KID24 binding domains of human KID24.<br>
[054] As used herein, the term "KID24 variant" denotes any amino acid variant<br>
of human KID24, including amino acid substitution, deletion, and addition<br>
variants, or any combination thereof. The definition encompasses chimeric<br>
molecules such as human KTD24/non-human chimeras and other hybrid<br>
molecules. Also included in the definition is any fragment of a KID24 variant<br>
molecule that comprises the variant or hybrid region(s) of the molecule.<br>
[055] An "antibody" is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding<br>
to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc.,<br>
through at least one antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the<br>
immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses not only<br><br>
Intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as<br>
Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, naturally occurring<br>
variants, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion with an antigen<br>
recognition site of the required specificity, humanized antibodies, chimeric<br>
antibodies, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin<br>
molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity.<br>
[056] A "monoclonal antibody" refers to a homogeneous antibody population<br>
wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally<br>
occurring and non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding<br>
of an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a<br>
single antigenic site. The term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses not only<br>
intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also<br>
fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain (ScFv), mutants<br>
thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, humanized monoclonal<br>
antibodies, chimeric- monoclonal antibodies, and any other modified<br>
configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen<br>
recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind to an antigen. It<br>
is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the<br>
manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant<br>
expression, transgenic animals, etc.). The term includes whole immunoglobulins<br>
as well as the fragments etc. described above under the definition of "antibody".<br>
[057j "Humanized" antibodies refer to a chimeric molecule, generally prepared<br>
using recombinant techniques, having an antigen binding site derived from an<br>
immunoglobulin from a non-human species and the remaining immunoglobulin<br>
structure of the molecule based upon the structure and/or sequence of a human<br>
immunoglobulin. The antigen-binding site may comprise either complete<br>
variable domains fused onto constant domains or only the complementarity<br>
determining regions (CDRs) grafted onto appropriate framework regions in the<br>
variable domains. Antigen binding sites may be wild type or modified by one or<br>
more amino acid substitutions. This eliminates the constant region as an<br>
imrnunogen in human individuals, but the possibility of an immune response to<br>
the foreign variable region remains (LoBuglio, A. F. et ah, (1989) Proc Natl Acad<br><br>
Sci USA 86:4220-4224). Another approach focuses not only on providing human-<br>
derived constant regions, but modifying the variable regions as well so as to<br>
reshape them as closely as possible to human form. It is known that the variable<br>
regions of both heavy and light chains contain three complementarity-<br>
determining regions (CDRs) which vary in response to the antigens in question<br>
and determine binding capability, flanked by four framework regions (FRs)<br>
which are relatively conserved in a given species and which putatively provide a<br>
scaffolding for the CDRs. When nonhuman antibodies are prepared with respect<br>
to a particular antigen, the variable regions can be "reshaped" or "humanized" by<br>
grafting CDRs derived from nonhuman antibody on the FRs present in the<br>
human antibody to be modified. Application of this approach to various<br>
antibodies has been reported by Sato, K., et al, (1993) Gincer Res 53:851-856.<br>
Riechmann, L., et al, (1988) Nature 332:323-327; Verhoeyen, M, et al., (1988)<br>
Science 239:1534-1536; Kettlehorough, G.-A.,.etal, (1991) Protein Engineering<br>
4:773-3783; Maeda, H., et al, (1991) Human Antibodies Hybridoma 2:124-134;<br>
Gorman, S. D., et al, (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88:4181-4185; Tempest, P. R.,<br>
et al, (1991) Bio/Technology 9:266-271; Co, M. S„ et al, (1991) Proc Natl Acad Sci<br>
USA 88:2869-2873; Carter, P., et al, (1992) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89:4285-4289;<br>
and Co, M. S. et al, (1992) J Immunol 148:1149-1154. In some embodiments,<br>
humanized antibodies preserve all CDR sequences (for example, a humanized<br>
mouse antibody which contains all six CDRs from the mouse antibodies). In<br>
other embodiments, humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two,<br>
three, four, five, six) which are altered with respect to the original antibody,<br>
which are also termed one or more CDRs "derived from" one or more CDRs<br>
from the original antibody.<br>
[058] xAn epitope that "specifically binds" or "preferentially binds" (used<br>
interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well<br>
understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential<br>
binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit "specific<br>
binding" or "preferential binding" if it reacts or associates more frequently,<br>
more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a<br>
particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An<br><br>
antibody "specifically binds" or "preferentially binds" to a target if it binds with<br>
greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds<br>
to other substances. For example, an antibody that specifically or preferentially<br>
binds to a KID24 epitope is an antibody that binds this KID24 epitope with<br>
greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds<br>
to other KID24 epitopes or non-KID24 epitopes. It is also understood by reading<br>
this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that<br>
specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or<br>
preferentially bind to a second target. As such, "specific binding" or<br>
"preferential binding" does not necessarily require (although it can include)<br>
exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means<br>
preferential binding.<br>
[059] The term "immunologically active" in reference to an epitope being or<br>
"remaining immunologically active" refers to. the ability of an antibody (e.g.,<br>
anti-I<td24 antibody to bind the epitope under different conditions for></td24>
example, after the epitope has been subjected to reducing and denaturing<br>
conditions.<br>
[060] Different biological functions are associated with anti-KID24 antibodies,<br>
including, but not Limited to, ability to bind to KID24 (including KID24 on cancer<br>
cells, including but not limited to pancreas, colon, lung or prostate cancer cells);<br>
ability to bind to a portion of KID24 that is exposed on the surface of a living cell<br>
(especially a cancer cell) in vitro or in vivo; ability to deliver a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent to cancerous cells (such as pancreas, colon, lung or prostate cancer cells)<br>
expressing KID24; ability to deliver a therapeutic agent or detectable marker into<br>
cancer cells expressing KID24. As discussed herein, polypeptides (including<br>
antibodies) of the invention may have any one or more of these characteristics.<br>
[061] An "anti-KID24 equivalent antibody" or "anti-KID24 equivalent<br>
polypeptide" refers to an antibody or a polypeptide having one or more<br>
biological functions associated with an anti-KID24 antibody, such as, for example<br>
binding specificity.<br>
[062] As used herein, "agent" refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical<br>
compound. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or<br><br>
inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an<br>
antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a<br>
toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be<br>
synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and<br>
oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core<br>
structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for<br>
screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can<br>
readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[063] Agents that are employed in the methods of this invention cai-i be<br>
randomly selected or rationally selected or designed. As used herein, an agent is<br>
said to be randomly selected when the agent is chosen randomly without<br>
considering the specific sequences involved in the association of KID24 with its<br>
native binding partners or known anubodies._-Ari;example of randomly selected<br>
agents is the use of a chemical library or a peptide combinatorial library.<br>
1064] As used herein, an agent is said to be rationally selected or designed when<br>
the agent is chosen on a nonrandom basis that takes into account the sequence of<br>
the target site and/or its conformation in connection with the agent's action.<br>
With respect to anti-KID24 agents, it is currently believed that there are at least<br>
three epitopes on KID24 against which antibodies can be raised and therefore at<br>
least three sites of action for agents that block KTD24/anti-KID24 interaction.<br>
This invention also encompasses agents that act at the sites of interaction<br>
between KID24 and its native binding partner, although other ligands and their<br>
active KID24-interactive sites are also encompassed within the scope of this<br>
invention, whether currently known or later identified. Agents can be rationally<br>
selected or rationally designed by utilizing the peptide sequences that make up<br>
the contact sites of the receptor/ligand and/or KID24/anti-KID24 antibody<br>
complex. For example, a rationally selected peptide agent can be a peptide whose<br>
amino acid sequence is identical to an epitope appearing on KID24 as it is<br>
exposed on the surface of a living cell in its native environment. Such an agent<br>
will reduce or block the association of the anti-KID24 antibody with KID24, or<br><br>
the association of KID24 with its native ligand, as desired, by binding to the anti-<br>
KID24 antibody or to the native ligand.<br>
[065j As used herein, the term "labeled", with regard to the antibody, is<br>
intended to encompass direct labeling of the antibody by coupling (i.e., physically<br>
linking) a detectable substance, such as a radioactive agent or a fluorophore {e.g.<br>
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerylhrin (PE)) to the antibody, as well<br>
as indirect labeling of the probe or antibody by reactivity with a detectable<br>
substance.<br>
[066} As used herein, the term "association", with regard to the antibody,<br>
includes covalent and non-covalent attachment or binding to an agent (e.g.,<br>
chemotherapeutic agent). The antibody can be associated with an agent (e.g.,<br>
chemotherapeutic agent) by direct binding or indirect binding via attachment to<br>
a common platform, such that the antibody directs the localization of the agent<br>
to the cancerous cell to which the antibody binds and wherein the antibody and<br>
: agent do not substantially dissociate under physiological conditions such that the<br>
agent is not targeted to the same cancerous cell to which the antibody binds or<br>
such that the agent's potency is not decreased.<br>
[067] A "biological sample" encompasses a variety of sample types obtained<br>
from an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. The<br>
definition encompasses saliva, blood and other liquid samples of biological<br>
origin, solid tissue samples such as a biopsy specimen or tissue cultures or cells<br>
derived therefrom, and the progeny thereof, for example, cells obtained from a<br>
tissue sample collected from an individual suspected of having cancer, in<br>
preferred embodiments from ovary, lung, prostate, pancreas, colon, and breast<br>
tissue. The definition also includes samples that have been manipulated in any<br>
way after their procurement, such as by treatment with reagents, solubilization,<br>
or enrichment for certain components, such as proteins or polynucleotides, or<br>
embedding in a semi-solid or solid matrix for sectioning purposes. The term<br>
"biological sample" encompasses a clinical sample, and also includes cells in<br>
culture, cell supernatants, cell lysates, serum, plasma, biological fluid, and tissue<br>
samples.<br><br>
[068] A "host cell" includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has<br>
been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host<br>
cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily<br>
be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the<br>
original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell<br>
includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.<br>
[069] As used herein, "preventing or delaying development of metastasis" (or<br>
metastases) means to stop, defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone<br>
development of metastasis. This delay can be of varying lengths of time,<br>
depending on the history of the cancer and/or individual being treated. As is<br>
evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect,<br>
encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the metastasis.<br>
[070J An "effective amount" of a pharmaceutical composition, in one<br>
, embodiment, is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results	: '<br>
tincluding, without limitation, clinical results such as shrinking the size of the-:<br>
tumor (in the cancer context, for example, breast or prostate cancer), retardation<br>
of cancerous cell growth, delaying the development of metastasis, decreasing<br>
symptoms resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those<br>
suffering from the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to<br>
treat the disease, enhancing the effect of another medication such as via targeting<br>
and/or internalization, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or<br>
prolonging survival of individuals. An effective amount can be administered in<br>
one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective<br>
amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount<br>
sufficient to reduce the proliferation of (or destroy) cancerous cells and to reduce<br>
and/or delay the development, or growth, of metastases of cancerous cells,<br>
either directly or indirectly. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a<br>
drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in<br>
conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Thus, an "effective amount" may be considered in the context of administering<br>
one or more chemotherapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to<br>
be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents,<br><br>
a desirable result may be or is achieved. While individual needs vary,<br>
determination of optimal ranges of effective amounts of each component is<br>
within the skill of the art. Typical dosages comprise 0.1-to 100 mg/kg/body<br>
weight. The preferred dosages comprise 1-to 100-mg/kg/body weight.<br>
Preferred dosages comprise 10 to 20-mg/kg/body weight and 10-to 100-<br>
mg/kg/body weight, and the most preferred dosages comprise approximately<br>
1-to 10-mg/kg/body weight.<br>
[0711 As used herein, a nucleic acid molecule or agent, antibody, composition or<br>
cell, etc., is said to be "isolated" when that nucleic acid molecule, agent, antibody,<br>
composition, or cell, etc. is substantially separated from contaminant nucleic acid<br>
molecules, antibodies, agents, compositions, or cells, etc. from its original source.<br>
[072] An "individual" is a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a<br>
human. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals, sport animals,<br>
. pets, primates, mice and rats.<br>
[073] The terms "polypeptide", "oligopeptide", "peptide" and "protein" are<br>
used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length.<br>
The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids,<br>
and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an<br>
amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for<br>
example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation,<br>
phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation<br>
with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example,<br>
polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for<br>
example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in<br>
the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are<br>
based upon an antibody, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or<br>
associated chains.<br>
[074] A "variable region" of an antibody refers to the variable region of the<br>
antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either<br>
alone or in combination.<br><br>
[075] A "constant region" of an antibody refers to the constant region of the<br>
antibody light chain or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either<br>
alone or in combination.<br>
[076] Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are peptidomimetics<br>
of the KID24 peptide agonists, antagonists and modulators (including anti-KTD24<br>
antibodies) described herein. Such peptidomimetics include peptides wherein at<br>
least one amino acid residue is substituted with an amino acid residue that is not<br>
commonly found in nature, such as the D isomer of the amino acid or an N-<br>
alkylated species of the amino acid. In other embodiments, peptidomimetics are<br>
constructed by replacing at least one amide bond (--C(.dbd.O)-NH—) in a KID24<br>
peptide agonist, antagonist or modulators with an amide isostere. Suitable<br>
amide isosteres include -CH.sub.2 -NH-, -CH.sub.2 ~S~, --CH.sub.2 -<br>
S(0).sub.n - (where n is 1 or 2), -CH.sub.2 --CH.sub.2 -, -CH.dbd.CH- (E or<br>
Z), -C(.dbd;0)-CH,sub.2 -, -CH(CN)-NH-, ~C(OH)~CH.sub.2 --, and -O-<br>
C(.dbd.O)—NH-. The amide bonds in a KID24 peptide agonist, antagonist or<br>
modulator that are suitable candidates for replacement with amide isosteres<br>
include bonds that are hydrolyzable by the endogenous esterases or proteases of<br>
the intended subject of KID24 peptide agonist, antagonist or modulator<br>
treatment.<br>
[077] As used herein, "substantially pure" refers to material that is at least 50%<br>
pure {i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably at least 90 % pure, more<br>
preferably at least 95% pure, more preferably at least 98% pure, more preferably<br>
at least 99% pure, or greater, pure.<br>
[078] "Toxin" refers to any substance, which effects an adverse response within<br>
a cell. For example, a toxin directed to a cancerous cell would have an adverse,<br>
sometimes deleterious effect, on the cancerous cell. Examples of toxins include,<br>
but are not limited to, radioisotopes, calicheamicin, and maytansinoids.<br>
[079] As used herein, "treatment" or "treating" is an approach for obtaining<br>
beneficial or desired results including and preferably clinical results. For<br>
purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are<br>
not limited to, one or more of the following: reducing the proliferation of (or<br>
destroying) cancerous cells or other diseased, reducing metastasis of cancerous<br><br>
cells found in cancers, shrinking the size of the tumor, decreasing symptoms<br>
resulting from the disease, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from<br>
the disease, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the<br>
disease, delaying the progression of the disease, and/or prolonging survival of<br>
individuals.<br>
[080] As used herein, a "therapeutic agent" means any agent useful for therapy<br>
(here, generally in the cancer context) including anti-tumor drugs, toxins or<br>
cytotoxins, cytotoxin agents, and radioactive agents.<br>
[0811 "Active immune response" refers to the development and on-going<br>
production of antibodies in vivo directed against an antigen, in response to the<br>
administration of the antigen, or DNA vectors coding for that antigen, to the<br>
host mammal by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or other mode of<br>
administration with or without an adjuvant. Active immune response can also<br>
include other aspects of the immune response, such as a cellular immune<br>
response. -.- '.■&gt;<br>
III. Methods of making antibodies and polypeptides<br>
(082) Methods of making monoclonal antibodies are known in the art. One<br>
method which may be employed is the method of Kohler and Milstein, Nature<br>
256:495-497 (1975) or a modification thereof. Typically, monoclonal antibodies<br>
are developed in non-human species, such as mice. In general, a mouse or rat is<br>
used for immunization but other animals may also be used. The antibodies are<br>
produced by immunizing mice with an immunogenic amount of cells, cell<br>
extracts, or protein preparations that contain human KID24. The immunogen<br>
can be, but is not limited to, primary cells, cultured cell lines, cancerous cells,<br>
nucleic acids, or tissue. In one embodiment, human fetal kidney epithelial cells<br>
are used. In another embodiment, human bladder or pancreatic progenitor cells<br>
are used. Methods for isolating and culturing human fetal kidney cells are<br>
detailed in Example 1. Cells used for immunization, for example, human fetal<br>
kidney cells, may be cultured for a period of time (at least 24 hours) prior to their<br>
use as an immunogen. Cells (e.g., human fetal kidney cells) may be used as<br>
immunogens by themselves or in combination with a non-denaturing adjuvant,<br><br>
such as Ribi. In general, cells should be kept intact and preferably viable when<br>
used as immunogens. Intact cells may allow antigens to be better detected than<br>
ruptured cells by the immunized animal. Use of denaturing or harsh adjuvants,<br>
e.g., Freud's adjuvant, may rupture the human fetal kidney or other cells and<br>
therefore is discouraged. The immunogen may be administered multiple times<br>
at periodic intervals such as, bi-weekly, or weekly, or may be administered in<br>
such a way as to maintain viability in the animal (e.g., in a tissue recombinant).<br>
Example 2 describes methods used to generate anti-KID24 antibodies and may<br>
be used to generate other monoclonal antibodies, which bind to KID24.<br>
[083] In one embodiment, monoclonal antibodies that bind to KID24 are<br>
obtained by using host cells that over-express KID24 as an immunogen. Such<br>
cells include, by way of example and not by limitation, human fetal kidney cells<br>
and human pancreatic cancer cells.	. __ _.<br>
[084j To monitor the antibody-response; a small biological sample (e.g., blood)<br>
may be obtained from the animal and tested for antibody titer against the<br>
immunogen. The spleen and/or several large lymph nodes can be removed and<br>
dissociated into single cells. If desired, the spleen cells may be screened (after<br>
removal of non-specifically adherent cells) by applying a cell suspension to a<br>
plate or to a well coated with the antigen. B-cells, expressing membrane-bound<br>
immunoglobulin specific for the antigen, will bind to the plate, and are not rinsed<br>
away with the rest of the suspension. Resulting B-cells, or all dissociated spleen<br>
cells, can then be fused with myeloma cells (e.g., X63-Ag8.653 and those from the<br>
Salk institute, Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, CA). Polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG) may be used to fuse spleen or lymphocytes with myeloma cells to form a<br>
hybridoma. The hybridoma is then cultured in a selective medium (e.g.,<br>
hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine medium, otherwise known as "HAT<br>
medium"). The resulting hybridomas are then plated by limiting dilution, and<br>
are assayed for the production of antibodies that bind specifically to the<br>
immunogen (e.g., surface of the human fetal kidney cells, surface of cancer cell<br>
lines, Ag-KID24, etc.) using FACS or immunohistochemistry (IHC screening).<br>
The selected monoclonal antibody-secreting hybridomas are then cultured either<br>
in vitro (e.g., in tissue culture bottles or hollow fiber reactors), or in vivo (e.g., as<br><br>
ascites in mice). Example 3 provides farmer details about the methods utilized<br>
to obtain and screen an anti-KrD24 antibody.<br>
[085| As another alternative to the cell fusion technique, EBV immortalized B<br>
cells may be used to produce monoclonal antibodies of the subject invention.<br>
The hybridomas are expanded and subcloned, if desired, and supernatants are<br>
assayed for anti-immunogen activity by conventional assay procedures {e.g.,<br>
FACS, IHC, radioimmunoassay, enzyme immunoassay, fluorescence<br>
immunoassay, etc.).<br>
[086] In another alternative, monoclonal antibody anti-KID24 and any other<br>
equivalent antibodies can be sequenced and produced recombinantly by any<br>
means known in the art {e.g., humanization, use of transgenic mice to produce<br>
fully human antibodies, phage display technology, etc.). In one embodiment,<br>
anti-KID24 monoclonal antibody is sequenced and .the polynucleotide sequence<br>
is then cloned into a vector for expression or propagation.. The sequence<br>
encoding the antibody of interest may be maintained in'a vector in a host cell<br>
and the host cell can then be expanded and frozen for future use.<br>
[087] The polynucleotide sequence of monoclonal antibody anti-KID24 and any<br>
other equivalent antibodies may be used for genetic manipulation to generate a<br>
"'humanized" antibody, to improve the affinity, or other characteristics of the<br>
antibody. The general principle in humanizing an antibody involves retaining<br>
the basic sequence of the antigen-binding portion of the antibody, while<br>
swapping the non-human remainder of the antibody with human antibody<br>
sequences. There are four general steps to humanize a monoclonal antibody.<br>
These are: (1) determining the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of<br>
the starting antibody light and heavy variable domains (2) designing the<br>
humanized antibody, i.e., deciding which antibody framework region to use<br>
during the humanizing process (3) the actual humanizing<br>
methodologies/techniques and (4) the transfection and expression of the<br>
humanized antibody. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,816,567; 5,807,715;<br>
5,866,692; and 6,331,415.<br>
[088] A number of "humanized" antibody molecules comprising an antigen-<br>
binding site derived from a non-human immunoglobulin have been described,<br><br>
including chimeric antibodies having rodent or modified rodent V regions and<br>
their associated complementarity determining regions (CDRs) fused to human<br>
constant domains. See, for example, Winter et al. Nature 349:293-299 (1991),<br>
Lobuglio et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 86:4220-4224 (1989), Shaw et al. /<br>
Immunol. 138:4534-4538 (1987), and Brown etal. Cancer Res. 47:3577-3583 (1987).<br>
Other references describe rodent CDRs grafted into a human supporting<br>
framework region (FR) prior to fusion with an appropriate human antibody<br>
constant domain. See, for example, Riechmarm et al. Nature 332:323-327 (1988),<br>
Verhoeyen et al. Science 239:1534-1536 (1988), and Jones et al. Nature 321:522-525<br>
(1986). Another reference describes rodent CDRs supported by recombinantly<br>
veneered rodent framework regions. See, for example, European Patent<br>
Publication No. 519,596. These "humanized" molecules are designed to minimize<br>
unwanted immunological response toward rodent anti-human antibody<br>
molecules, which limits the duration and effectiveness of therapeutic'applications<br>
of those moieties in human recipients. Other methods of humanizing antibodies<br>
that may also be utilized are disclosed by Daugherty et al., Nucl. Acids Res.,<br>
19:2471-2476 (1991) and in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,180,377; 6,054,297; 5,997,867; and .<br>
5,866,692.<br>
[089] The invention also encompasses single chain variable region fragments<br>
("scFv") of antibodies of this invention, such as mu-anti-KTD24. Single chain<br>
variable region fragments are made by linking light and/or heavy chain variable<br>
regions by using a short linking peptide. Bird et al. (1988) Science 242: 423-426<br>
describes example of linking peptides which bridge approximately 3.5 ran<br>
between the carboxy terminus of one variable region and the amino terminus of<br>
the other variable region. Linkers of other sequences have been designed and<br>
used, Bird et al. (1988). Linkers can in turn be modified for additional functions,<br>
such as attachment of drugs or attachment to solid supports. The single chain<br>
variants can be produced either recombinantly or synthetically. For synthetic<br>
production of scFv, an automated synthesizer can be used. For recombinant<br>
production of scFv, a suitable plasmid containing polynucleotide that encodes the<br>
scFv can be introduced into a suitable host cell, either eukaryotic, such as yeast,<br>
plant, insect or mammalian cells, or prokaryotic, such as E. coli. Polynucleotides<br><br>
encoding the scFv of interest can be made by routine manipulations such as<br>
ligation of polynucleotides. The resultant scFv can be isolated using standard<br>
protein purification techniques known in the art.<br>
[0901 The invention includes modifications to KID24 agonists, antagonists,<br>
modulators and antibodies, including functionally equivalent antibodies and<br>
polypeptides that do not significantly affect their properties and variants that<br>
have enhanced or decreased activity. Modification of polypeptides is routine<br>
practice in the art and need not be described in detail herein. Examples of<br>
modified polypeptides include polypeptides with conservative substitutions of<br>
amino acid residues, one or more deletions or additions of amino acids which do<br>
not significantly deleteriously change the functional activity, or use of chemical<br>
analogs. Amino acid residues which can be conservatively substituted for one<br>
another include but are not limited to: glycine/alanine;<br>
valine/isoleucine/leucine; asparagine/glutamine; aspartic acid/glutamic acid;<br>
:. serine/threonine; lysine/arginine; and phenylalanine/•tryos'ine. These	•- • 
polypeptides also include glycosylated and nonglycosylated polypeptides, as well<br>
as polypeptides with other post-translational modifications, such as, for example,<br>
glycosylation with different sugars, acetylation, and phosphorylation.<br>
Preferably, the amino acid substitutions would be conservative, i.e., die<br>
substituted amino acid would possess similar chemical properties as that of the<br>
original amino acid. Such conservative substitutions are known in the art, and<br>
examples have been provided above. Amino acid modifications can range from<br>
changing or modifying one or more amino acids to complete redesign of a<br>
region, such as the variable region. Changes in the variable region can alter<br>
binding affinity and /or specificity. Other methods of modification include using<br>
coupling techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, enzymatic<br>
means, oxidative substitution and chelation. Modifications can be used, for<br>
example, for attachment of labels for immunoassay, such as the attachment of<br>
radioactive moieties for radioimmunoassay. Modified polypeptides are made<br>
using established procedures in the art and can be screened using standard<br>
assays known in the art.<br><br>
[091] The invention also encompasses fusion proteins comprising one or more<br>
fragments or regions from the polypeptides and antibodies of this invention. En<br>
one embodiment a fusion polypeptide is provided that comprises at least 10<br>
contiguous amino acids of variable light chain region and at least 10 amino acids<br>
of variable heavy chain region. En another embodiment, the fusion polypeptide<br>
contains a heterologous immunoglobulin constant region. In another<br>
embodiment, the fusion polypeptide contains a light chain variable region and a<br>
heavy chain variable region of an antibody produced from a hybridoma<br>
deposited with the ATCC as described herein. For purposes of this invention, an<br>
antibody fusion protein contains one or more anti-KID24 polypeptides and<br>
another amino acid sequence to which it is not attached in the native molecule,<br>
for example, a heterologous sequence or a homologous sequence from another<br>
region,<br>
i [092] An anti-KID24 polypeptide, and other KID24 agonists, antagonists and- .: '<br>
modulators can be created by methods known in the art, for example;	' J<br>
synthetically or recombinantly. One method of producing KID24 peptide<br>
agonists, antagonists and modulators involves chemical synthesis of the<br>
polypeptide, followed by treatment under oxidizing conditions appropriate to<br>
obtain the native conformation, that is, the correct disulfide bond linkages. This<br>
can be accomplished using methodologies well known to those skilled in the art<br>
(see Kelley, R. F. &amp; Winkler, M. E. in Genetic Engineering Principles and<br>
Methods, Setlow, J. K., ed., Plenum Press, N.Y., vol. 12, pp 1-19 (1990); Stewart, J.<br>
M. &amp; Young, J. D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford,<br>
111. (1984); see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,105,603; 3,972,859; 3,842,067; and 3,862,925).<br>
[093] Polypeptides of the invention may be conveniently prepared using solid<br>
phase peptide synthesis (Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 85:2149 (1964); Houghten,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5132 (1985)).<br>
[094] In yet another alternative, fully human antibodies may be obtained by<br>
using commercially available mice that have been engineered to express specific<br>
human immunoglobulin proteins. Transgenic animals that are designed to<br>
produce a more desirable (e.g., fully human antibodies) or more robust immune<br>
response may also be used for generation of humanized or human antibodies.<br><br>
Examples of such technology are Xenomouse ™ from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont,<br>
CA) and HuMAb-Mouse® and TC Mouse™ from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, NJ).<br>
[095] In an alternative, antibodies may be made recombinantly and expressed<br>
using any method known in the art. Antibodies may be made recombinantly by<br>
first isolating the antibodies made from host animals, obtaining the gene<br>
sequence, and using the gene sequence to express the antibody recombinantly in<br>
host cells (e.g., CHO cells). Another method that may be employed is to express<br>
the antibody sequence in plants (e.g., tobacco) or transgenic milk. Methods for<br>
expressing antibodies recombinantly in plants or milk have been disclosed. See,<br>
for example, Peeters, et al. (2001) Vaccine 19:2756; Lonberg, N. and D. Huszar<br>
(1995) Int.Rev..Immunol 13:65; and Pollock, et al.(1999) / Immunol Methods 231:147.<br>
Methods for making derivatives of antibodies, e.g., humanized, single chain, etc.<br>
are known .in the art. In another alternative, antibodies may be made<br>
..recombinantly by phage display technology. See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.i ■
:, 5,565,332; 5,580,717; 5,733,743; 6,265,150; and Winter et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. .■<br>
12:433-455 (1994).<br>
[096] The antibodies or protein of interest may be subjected to sequencing by<br>
Edman degradation, which is well known to those of skill in the art. The peptide<br>
information generated from mass spectrometry or Edman degradation can be<br>
used to design probes or primers that are used to clone the protein of interest.<br>
[097] An alternative method of cloning the protein of interest is by "panning"<br>
using purified KID24 or portions thereof for cells expressing the antibody or<br>
protein of interest. The "panning" procedure is conducted by obtaining a cDNA<br>
library from tissues or cells that express the antibody or protein of interest, over-<br>
expressing the cDNAs in a second cell type, and screening the transfected cells of<br>
the second cell type for a specific binding to KID24. Detailed descriptions of the<br>
methods used in cloning mammalian genes coding for cell surface proteins by<br>
"panning" can be found in the art. See, for example, Aruffo, A. and Seed, B. Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84,8573-8577 (1987) and Stephan, J. et al, Endocrinology 140:<br>
5841-5854 (1999).<br>
[098] cDNAs encoding anti-KID24 antibodies, and other KID24 peptide<br>
agonists, antagonists and modulators can be obtained by reverse transcribing<br><br>
the mRNAs from a particular cell type according to standard methods in the art.<br>
Specifically, mRNA can be isolated using various lytic enzymes or chemical<br>
solutions according to the procedures set forth in Sambrook, et al. supra or<br>
extracted by commercially available nucleic-acid-binding resins following the<br>
accompanying instructions provided by manufacturers (e.g., Qiagen, Invitrogen,<br>
Promega). The synthesized cDNAs are then introduced into an expression<br>
vector to produce the antibody or protein of interest in cells of a second type. It<br>
is implied that an expression vector must be replicable in the host cells either as<br>
episomes or as an integral part of the chromosomal DNA. Suitable expression<br>
vectors include but are not limited to plasmids, viral vectors, including<br>
adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, retroviruses, and cosmids.<br>
(099] The vectors containing the polynucleotides of interest can be introduced<br>
into the host cell by any of a number of appropriate means, including<br>
electroporation; transfection employing calcium chloride, rubidium chloride,<br>
calcium phosphate, DEAE-dextran, or other substances; microprojectile<br>
bombardment; lipofection; and infection (e.g., where the vector is an infectious<br>
agent such as vaccinia virus). The choice of introducing vectors or<br>
polynucleotides will often depend on features of the host cell.<br>
[OiOOj Any host ceils capable of over-expressing heterologous DNAs can be used<br>
for the purpose of isolating the genes encoding the antibody, polypeptide or<br>
protein of interest. Non-limiting examples of mammalian host cells include but<br>
not limited to COS, HeLa, and CHO cells. Preferably, the host cells express the<br>
cDNAs at a level of about 5 fold higher, more preferably 10 fold higher, even<br>
more preferably 20 fold higher than that of the corresponding endogenous<br>
antibody or protein of interest, if present, in the host cells. Screening the host<br>
cells for a specific binding to KID24 is effected by an immunoassay or FACS. A<br>
cell over-expressing the antibody or protein of interest can be identified.<br>
[0101] Various techniques are also available which may now be employed to<br>
produce mutant KID24 peptide agonists, antagonists, and modulators which<br>
encodes for additions, deletions, or changes in amino acid sequence of the<br>
resultant protein relative to the parent KID24 peptide agonist, antagonist or<br>
modulator molecule.<br><br>
(0102] The invention includes polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence<br>
of the antibodies of this invention. The polypeptides of this invention can be<br>
made by procedures known in the art. The polypeptides can be produced by<br>
proteolytic or other degradation of the antibodies, by recombinant methods (i.e.,<br>
single or fusion polypeptides) as described above or by chemical synthesis.<br>
Polypeptides of the antibodies, especially shorter polypeptides up to about 50<br>
amino acids, are conveniently made by chemical synthesis. Methods of chemical<br>
synthesis are known in the art and are commercially available. For example, an<br>
anti-KID24 polypeptide could be produced by an automated polypeptide<br>
synthesizer employing the solid phase method.<br>
IV. Methods for screening polypeptides and monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0103] Several methods may be used to screen polypeptides and monoclonal<br>
antibodies that bind toKID24. It is understood that "binding" refers to<br>
biologically or immunologically relevant binding, i.e., binding which is specific<br>
for the unique antigen for which the immunoglobulin molecule is encoded,or to<br>
which the polypeptide is directed. It does not refer to non-specific binding that<br>
may occur when an immunoglobulin is used at a very high concentration against<br>
a non-specific target. In one embodiment, monoclonal antibodies are screened<br>
for binding to KID24 using standard screening techniques. In this manner, anti-<br>
KID24 monoclonal antibody was obtained. In accordance with the Budapest<br>
Treaty, a hybridoma which produces anti-KID24 monoclonal antibodies has been<br>
deposited in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 10801 University<br>
Blvd., Manassas VA 20110-2209 on May 2,2003 with a Patent Deposit<br>
Designation of PTA# 5174.<br>
[0104J Monoclonal antibodies that bind to KTD24 are screened for binding to<br>
cancerous tissues and non-cancerous cells. In one embodiment, monoclonal<br>
antibodies which bind to KID24 and that are also cross reactive to human<br>
cancerous cells or tissues, but not to normal cells or tissues to the same degree,<br>
are selected. One method that may be employed for screening is<br>
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Standard immunohistochemical techniques are<br>
known to those of average skill in the art. See, for example, Animal Cell Culture<br><br>
Methods (J.P. Mather and D. Barnes, eds., Academic Press, Vol. 57, Ch. 18 and 19,<br>
pp. 314-350,1998). Biological samples (e.g., tissues) may be obtained from<br>
biopsies, autopsies, or necropsies. To ascertain if KID24 is present only on<br>
cancerous cells, anti-KID24 antibodies may be used to detect the presence of<br>
KID24 on tissues from individuals with cancer while other non-cancerous tissues<br>
from the individual suffering from cancer or tissues from individuals without<br>
cancer are used as a control. The tissue can be embedded in a solid or semi-solid<br>
substance that prevents damage during freezing (e.g., agarose gel or OCT) and<br>
then sectioned for staining. Cancers from different organs and at different<br>
grades can be used to screen monoclonal antibodies. Examples of tissues that<br>
may be used for screening purposes include but are not limited to ovary, breast,<br>
lung, prostate, colon, kidney, skin, thyroid, brain, heart, liver, stomach, nerve,<br>
blood vessels, bone, upper digestive tract, and pancreas. Examples of different<br>
cancer types that may be used.for screening purposes include but are not limited<br>
to carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, adenosarcomas, lymphomas, and<br>
leukemias.	.;<br>

cells from their respective tissues may be used to screen for monoclonal<br>
antibodies which are specific for cancerous tissue. Primary, or low passage, cell<br>
cultures derived from normal tissues from different organs, including but not<br>
limited to, kidney, ovary, breast, lung, prostate, colon, kidney, skin, thyroid,<br>
aortic smooth muscle, and endothelial cells can be used as negative controls. The<br>
cancerous or non-cancerous cells can be grown on glass slides or coverslips, or<br>
on plastic surfaces, or prepared in a CeilArray™, as described in WO 01/43869,<br>
and screened for the binding of antibody using IHC as described above for<br>
tissues. Alternatively, cells may be removed from the growth surface using non-<br>
proteolytic means and spun into a pellet, which is then embedded and treated as<br>
tissues for IHC analysis as described above. Cells may be inoculated into<br>
immunodeficient animals, a tumor allowed to grow; and then this tumor may be<br>
harvested, embedded, and used as a tissue source for IHC analysis. In another<br>
alternative, single cells may be screened by incubating with the primary<br>
antibody, a secondary "reporter" antibody linked to a fluorescent molecule and<br>
then analyzed using a fluorescent activated cell-sorting (FACS) machine. In yet<br>
another alternative, live cell ELISAs can be used to screen for antibodies mat are<br>
specific for cancer cell lines (such as the ones listed above) and normal cells from<br>
their respective tissues. Cells may be plated onto 96-well plates and then grown<br>
to confluency. The growth medium is then removed and the cells are blocked<br>
with blocking buffer. Primary antibodies may be added and then the plates<br>
washed and secondary antibodies added and the plates may be developed by<br>
adding a substrate and color change can be detected using a plate reader.<br>
10106} Several different detection systems may be utilized to detect binding of<br>
antibodies to tissue section. Typically, immunohistochemistry involves the<br>
binding of a primary antibody to the tissue and then a secondary antibody<br>
reactive against the species from the primary antibody was generated and<br>
conjugated to a detectable marker {e.g., horseradish peroxidase, HRP, or<br>
diaminobenzedine, DAB). One alternative method that may be used is<br>
polyclonal mirror image complementary antibodies or polyMICA. PolyMICA<br><br>
(polyclonal Mirror Image Complementary Antibodies) technique, described by<br>
D.C. Mangham and P.G. Isaacson {Histopathologij (1999) 35(2):129-33)/ can be used<br>
to test binding of primary antibodies {e.g., anti-KID24 antibodies) to normal and<br>
cancerous tissue. Several kinds of polyMICA™ Detection kits are commercially<br>
available from The Binding Site Limited (P.O. Box 4073 Birmingham B29 6AT<br>
England). Product No. HK004.D is a polyMICA™ Detection kit which uses DAB<br>
chromagen. Product No. HK004.A is a polyMICA™ Detection kit which uses<br>
AEC chromagen. Alternatively, the primary antibody may be direcdy labeled<br>
with the detectable marker.<br>
[0107] The first step in IHC screening to select for an appropriate antibody is the<br>
binding of primary antibodies raised in mice (e.g., anti-KID24 antibodies) to one<br>
or more immunogens (e.g., cells or tissue samples). In one embodiment, the<br>
tissue_sample is sections of frozen tissue from different organs. The cells or<br>
tissue samples can be either cancerous or non-cancerous.	;<br>
[0108] Frozen tissues can be prepared, sectioned, with or without fixation, and<br>
IHC performed by any of a number of methods known to one familiar with the<br>
art. See, for example, Stephan et al. Dev. Biol. 212: 264-277 (1999), and Stephan et<br>
al. Endocrinology 140: 5841-54 (1999).<br>
V. Methods of characterizing anti-KlD24 antibodies<br>
[0109] Several methods can be used to characterize anti-KID24 antibodies. One<br>
method is to identify the epitope to which it binds. Epitope mapping is<br>
commercially available from various sources, for example, Pepscan Systems<br>
(Edelhertweg 15,8219 PH Lelystad, The Netherlands). Epitope mapping can be<br>
used to determine the sequence to which an anti-KID24 antibody binds. The<br>
epitope can be a linear epitope, i.e., contained in a single stretch of amino acids,<br>
or a conformational epitope formed by a three-dimensional interaction of amino<br>
acids that may not necessarily be contained in a single stretch. Peptides of<br>
varying lengths {e.g., at least 4-6 arnino acids long) can be isolated or synthesized<br>
(e.g., recombinantly) and used for binding assays with anti-KID24 antibody. The<br>
epitope to which anti-KID24 antibody binds can be determined in a systematic<br><br>
screening by using overlapping peptides derived from the extracellular sequence<br>
and determining binding by anti-KID24 antibody.<br>
[0110] Yet another method that can be used to characterize an anti-KID24<br>
antibody is to use competition assays with other antibodies known to bind to the<br>
same antigen, i.e., KID24 to determine if anti-KID24 antibodies binds to the same<br>
epitope as other antibodies. Examples of commercially available antibodies to<br>
KID24 may be available and may be identified using the binding assays taught<br>
herein. Competition assays are well known to those of skill in the art, and such<br>
procedures and illustrative data are detailed further in the Examples. Anti-KID24<br>
antibodies can be further characterized by the tissues, type of cancer or type of<br>
tumor to which they bind.<br>
(011 lj Another method of characterizing anti-KID24 antibodies is by the antigen<br>
to which it binds. Anti-KID24 antibodies were used in.Western blots with cell<br>
lysates from various human cancers. As is known to one of .skill in-the .art,<br>
■■ Western blotting can involve running cell lysates and/or. cell fractions on a<br>
denaturing or non-denaturing gel, transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose<br>
paper, and then probing the blot with an antibody (e.g., anti-KID24 antibody) to<br>
see which proteins are bound by the antibody. This procedure is detailed further<br>
in Example 4. K1D24 is associated with various human cancers of different tissues<br>
including but not limited to colon, breast, ovary, pancreas and lung. Further<br>
description of KID24 is given in Example 6 and 7.<br>
VI. Methods of diagnosing cancer using anti-KIDli antibodies and KID24 modulators<br>
[0112J Monoclonal antibodies to KID24 made by the methods disclosed herein<br>
may be used to identify the presence or absence of cancerous cells in a variety of<br>
tissues, including but not limited to, ovary, breast, lung, prostate, colon, kidney,<br>
pancreas, skin, thyroid, brain, heart, liver, stomach, nerve, blood vessels, bone,<br>
and upper digestive tract, for purposes of diagnosis. Monoclonal antibodies to<br>
KID24 made by the methods disclosed herein may also be used to identify the<br>
presence or absence of cancerous cells, or the level thereof, which are circulating<br>
in blood after their release from a solid tumor. Such circulating antigen may be<br>
an intact KID24 antigen, or a fragment thereof that retains the ability to be<br><br>
detected according to the methods taught herein. Such detection may be<br>
effected by FACS analysis using standard methods commonly used in the art.<br>
(01131 These uses can involve the formation of a complex between KID24 and an<br>
antibody that binds specifically to KTD24. Examples of such antibodies include<br>
but are not limited to those anti-KTD24 monoclonal antibodies produced by the<br>
hybridoma deposited in the ATCC with the designation PTA# 5174. The<br>
formation of such a complex can be in vitro or in vivo. Without being bound by<br>
theory, monoclonal antibody anti-KID24 can bind to KID24 through the<br>
extracellular domain of KID24 and may then be internalized.<br>
[0114] In a preferred embodiment of the diagnostic methods of this invention,<br>
the antibody bears a detectable label. Examples of labels that may be used<br>
include a radioactive agent or a fluorophore, such as fluoroisothiocyanate or<br>
phycoerythrin.	_^._ __.<br>
[0115] As with other known antibodies used commercially for diagnostic and<br>
therapeutic purposes, the target antigen of this invention is broadly expressed in-<br>
normal tissue. It is also up regulated in some tumors. Therefore, the particular ■<br>
dosages and routes of delivery of the antibodies of this invention as used for<br>
diagnostic or therapeutic agents will be tailored to the particular tumor or<br>
disease state at hand, as well as to the particular individual being treated.<br>
[0116] One method of using the antibodies for diagnosis is in vivo tumor imaging<br>
by linking the antibody to a radioactive or radioopaque agent, administering the<br>
antibody to the individual and using an x-ray or other imaging machine to<br>
visualize the localization of the labeled antibody at the surface of cancer cells<br>
expressing the antigen. The antibody is administered at a concentration that<br>
promotes binding at physiological conditions.<br>
[0117] In vitro techniques for detection of KID24 are routine in the art and include<br>
enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunoprecipitations,<br>
immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA),<br>
and Western blot analysis.<br>
[0118J In aspects of this invention, methods of radioimaging of tumours or<br>
neoplasms, or of measuring the effectiveness of a method of treatment with a<br>
radiolabeled antibody, comprising the step of administering a radiolabelled,<br><br>
tumour-specific antibody to an individual following the practice of this invention.<br>
The radiolabeled antibody may be a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody<br>
comprising a radiolabel, preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
Technetium-99m, Indium-Ill, Iodine-131, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188,<br>
Samarium-153, Lutetium-177, Copper-64, Scandium-47, Yttrium-90. Monoclonal<br>
antibodies labelled with therapeutic radionuclides such as Iodine-131, Rhenium-<br>
188, Holmium-166, Samarium-153 and Scandium-47, which do not compromise<br>
the immunoreactivity of antibodies and are not broken down in vivo, are<br>
especially preferred. The person skilled in the art will appreciate that other<br>
radioactive isotopes are known, and may be suitable for specific applications.<br>
The radioimaging may be conducted using Single Photon Emission Computer<br>
Tomography (SPECT), Position Emmission Tomography (PET), Computer<br>
Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR1). Correlative imaging,<br>
• whichpermits greater anatomical definition of location of metastases located by ■•'.. ' •<br>
radioimmunoimaging, is also contemplated.<br>
[0119] In other methods, the cancerous cells are removed and the tissue<br>
prepared for immunohistochemistry by methods well known in the art (e.g.,<br>
embedding in a freezing compound, freezing and sectioning, with or without<br>
fixation; fixation and paraffin embedding with or without various methods of<br>
antigen retrieval and counterstaining). The monoclonal antibodies may also be<br>
used to identify cancerous cells at different stages of development. The<br>
antibodies may also be used to determine which individuals' tumors express the<br>
antigen on their surface at a pre-determined level and are thus candidates for<br>
immunotherapy using antibodies directed against said antigen. The antibodies<br>
may recognize both primary and metastasizing cancers of the kidney, ovary,<br>
prostate and pancreas and primary cancers of the lung that express KID24. As<br>
used herein, detection may include qualitative and/or quantitative detection and<br>
may include comparing the level measured to a normal cell for an increased level<br>
of expression of KID24 in cancerous cells.<br>
[0120] The invention also provides methods of aiding diagnosis of cancer (such<br>
as pancreatic, colon, lung, or prostate cancer) in an individual using any antibody<br>
that binds to KID24 and any other methods that can be used determine the level<br><br>
of KID24 expression. As used herein, methods for "aiding diagnosis" means that<br>
these methods assist in making a clinical determination regarding the<br>
classification, or nature, of cancer, and may or may not be conclusive with<br>
respect to the definitive diagnosis. Accordingly, a method of aiding diagnosis of<br>
cancer can comprise the step of detecting the level of KID24 in a biological<br>
sample from the individual and/or determining the level of KID24 expression in<br>
the sample. Antibodies recognizing the antigen or a portion thereof may also be<br>
used to create diagnostic immunoassays for detecting antigen released or<br>
secreted from living or dying cancer cells in bodily fluids, including but not<br>
limited to, blood, saliva, urine, pulmonary fluid, or ascites fluid,<br>
10121] Not all cells in a particular tumor of interest will express KID24, and<br>
cancerous cells in other tissues may express KID24, thus an individual should be<br>
screened for the presence or absence of KID24 orrcancerous cells to determine<br>
the usefulness of immunotherapy in the individual. The anti-KID24 antibodies<br>
made by the methods disclosed herein may be used to determine whether an<br>
individual diagnosed with cancer may be deemed a candidate for<br>
immunotherapy using antibodies directed against KID24. In one embodiment, a<br>
cancerous tumor or a biopsy sample may be tested for expression of KID24,<br>
using antibodies directed against KID24. individuals with cancer cells that<br>
express KID24 are suitable candidates for immunotherapy using antibodies<br>
directed against KID24. Staining with anti-KID24 antibody may also be used to<br>
distinguish cancerous tissues from normal tissues.<br>
[0122J Methods of using anti-KID24 antibodies for diagnostic purposes are useful<br>
both before and after any form of anti-cancer treatment, e.g., chemotherapy or<br>
radiation therapy, to determine which tumors are most likely to respond to a<br>
given treatment, prognosis for individual with cancer, tumor subtype or origin<br>
of metastatic disease, and progression of the disease or response to treatment.<br>
[0123J The compositions of this invention are also suitable for diagnosis of<br>
disease states other man cancer, using the methods generally described above in<br>
application with other diseased (non-cancerous) cells. Disease states suitable for<br>
use in the methods of this invention include, but are not limited to, diseases or<br>
disorders associated with inflammatory or autoimmune responses in individuals.<br><br>
The methods described above may be used for modulating inflammatory or<br>
autoimmune responses in individuals. Diseases and conditions resulting from<br>
inflammation and autoimmune disorders that may be subject to diagnosis<br>
and /or treatment using the compositions and methods of the invention include,<br>
by way of illustration and not of limitation, multiple sclerosis, meningitis,<br>
encephalitis, stroke, other cerebral traumas, inflammatory bowel disease<br>
including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, myasthenia gravis, lupus,<br>
rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, acute juvenile onset diabetes, AIDS dementia,<br>
atherosclerosis, nephritis, retinitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, myocardial<br>
ischemia and acute leukocyte-mediated lung injury.<br>
[0124J Still other indications for diagnostic and/or therapeutic use of antibodies<br>
and other therapeutic agents of the invention include administration to<br>
individuals at risk of organ or graft rejection. Over recent years there has been a<br>
considerable improvement in the efficiency of surgical techniques for<br>
transplanting tissues and organs such as. skin, kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas<br>
and bone marrow. Perhaps the principal outstanding problem is the lack of<br>
satisfactory agents for inducing immunotolerance in the recipient to the<br>
transplanted allograft or organ. When allogeneic cells or organs are transplanted<br>
into a host (i.e., the donor and donee are different individuals from the same<br>
species), the host immune system is likely to mount an immune response to<br>
foreign antigens in the transplant (host-versus-graft disease) leading to<br>
destruction of the transplanted tissue.<br>
[0125] Uses described anywhere in this application that recite their use for anti-<br>
KID24 antibodies also encompass the use of other KID24 agonists, antagonists<br>
and modulators as described herein. In such embodiments, the KID24 agonists,<br>
antagonist or other non-antibody modulator is substituted for the KID24<br>
antibody in the steps described, and alterations within the scope of the ordinarily<br>
skilled practitioner are made to tailor the method to the substituted KID24<br>
modulatory composition.<br>
VII. Compositions of this invention<br><br>
[0126] This invention also encompasses compositions, including pharmaceutical<br>
compositions, comprising anti-KID24 antibodies, polypeptides derived from anti-<br>
KID24 antibodies, polynucleotides comprising sequence encoding anti-KID24<br>
antibodies, and other agents as described herein. As used herein, compositions<br>
further comprises one or more antibodies, polypeptides and/or proteins that<br>
bind to KID24, KID24 agonists, antagonists, modulators, and/or one or more<br>
polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies,<br>
polypeptides and proteins that bind to KID24.<br>
[0127J The invention further provides for conjugates of any KID24 peptide<br>
agonist, antagonist or modulator, and additional chemical structures that support<br>
the intended function or functions of the particular KID24 peptide agonist,<br>
antagonist or modulator. These conjugates include KID24 peptide agonist,<br>
antagonist or modulator covalently bound to a jmacromolecule such as any<br>
insoluble, solid support matrix used in the diagnostic, screening or purification<br>
procedures discussed herein. Suitable matrix materials include any substance<br>
that is chemically inert, has high porosity and has large numbers of functional<br>
groups capable of forming covalent linkages with peptide Iigands. Examples of<br>
matrix materials and procedures for preparation of-matrix-ligand conjugates are<br>
described in Dean et al. (eds) Affinity Chromatography: A Practical Approach,<br>
IRL Press (1985); Lowe, "An Introduction to Affinity Chromatography", in Work<br>
et al. (eds) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Vol. 7,<br>
Part II, North-Holland (1979); Porath et al., "Biospecific Affinity<br>
Chromatography", in Neurath et al. (eds), The Proteins, 3rd ed., Vol. 1, pp. 95-<br>
178 (1975); and Schott, Affinity Chromatography, Dekker (1984).<br>
[01281 Also provided herein are conjugates of KID24 peptide agonist, antagonist<br>
or modulator and any reporter moiety used in the diagnostic procedures<br>
discussed herein.<br>
[0129] The KID24 peptide agonist, antagonist or modulator agents, polypeptides<br>
and proteins of this invention, including anti-KID24 antibodies, are further<br>
identified and characterized by any (one or more) of the following criteria: (a)<br>
ability to bind to KID24 (including KID24 on cancer cells, including but not<br>
limited to pancreatic, colon, lung or prostate cancer cells); (b) ability to<br><br>
competitively inhibits preferential binding of a known anti-B3D24 antibody to<br>
KID24, including the ability to preferentially bind to the same KID24 epitope to<br>
which the original antibody preferentially binds; (c) ability to bind to a portion<br>
of KID24 that is exposed on the surface of a living cell in vitro or in vivo; (d) ability<br>
to bind to a portion of KID24 that is exposed on the surface of living cancer cells,<br>
such as but not limited to ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, lung, colon, or breast<br>
cancer cells; (e) ability to deliver a chemotherapeutic agent or detectable marker<br>
to cancerous cells (such as but not limited to ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, lung,<br>
colon, or breast cancer cells) expressing KID24; (f) ability to deliver a therapeutic<br>
agent into cancerous cells (such as but not limited to lung cancer cells) expressing<br>
KID24.<br>
[0130] In some embodiments, the antibody of the invention is an antibody that is<br>
produced by a host cell with a deposit number of_ATCC No. PTA# 5174, or<br>
progeny thereof. The present invention.also encompasses various formulations<br>
of antibodies produced by these deposited hybridomas andequivalent<br>
antibodies or polypeptide fragments {e.g., Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv, Fc, etc.), chimeric<br>
antibodies, single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an<br>
antibody portion, humanized antibodies, and any other modified configuration<br>
of any of these or equivalent antibodies that comprises an antigen (KID24),<br>
recognition site of the required specificity. The invention also provides human<br>
antibodies displaying one or more of the biological characteristics of an anti-<br>
KID24 family member. The equivalent antibodies of the anti-KID24 family<br>
(including humanized antibodies and human antibodies), polypeptide fragments,<br>
and polypeptides comprising any of these fragments are identified and<br>
characterized by any (one or more) of the five criteria described above.<br>
[0131] In some embodiments, the antibodies, polypeptides and proteins of the<br>
invention that bind to KID24 are antibodies, polypeptides and proteins that<br>
competitively inhibit preferential binding of a herein-specified anti-KID24<br>
antibody to KID24. In some embodiments, the antibodies, the polypeptides and<br>
the proteins preferentially bind to the same epitope on KID24 as the antibody<br>
mu-anti-KID24 preferentially binds.<br><br>
[0132| Accordingly, the invention provides any of the following (or<br>
compositions, including pharmaceutical compositions, comprising any of the<br>
following): (a) an antibody produced by the host cell with a deposit number<br>
identified above or its progeny; (b) a humanized form of such an antibody; (c) an<br>
antibody comprising one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain variable<br>
regions of such an antibody; (d) a chimeric antibody comprising variable regions<br>
homologous or derived from variable regions of a heavy chain and a light chain<br>
of such an antibody, and constant regions homologous or derived from constant<br>
regions of a heavy chain and a light chain of a human antibody; (e) an antibody<br>
comprising one or more of the light chain and /or heavy chain CDRs (at least<br>
one, two, three, four, five, or six) of such an antibody; (f) an antibody comprising<br>
a heavy and /or a light chain of such an antibody; (g) a human antibody that is<br>
equivalent to such an antibody. A humanized form of the antibody may or may<br>
not have CDRs identical to that original antibody, orantibody produced by a<br>
host cell with a deposit number identified above. Determination of GDR regions<br>
is well within the skill of the art. In some embodiments, the- invention provides<br>
an antibody which comprises at least one CDR that is substantially homologous<br>
to at least one CDP-, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least 5 CDRs of an<br>
antibody produced by one of the above-identified deposited hybridomas (or, in<br>
some embodiments substantially homologous to all 6 CDRs of one of these<br>
antibodies, or derived from one of these antibodies), or antibody produced by<br>
the host cell with a deposit number identified above. Other embodiments<br>
include antibodies that have at least two, three, four, five, or six CDR(s) that are<br>
substantially homologous to at least two, three, four, five or six CDRs of an<br>
antibody produced from a hybridoma deposited as identified herein, or derived<br>
from such an antibody. It is understood that, for purposes of this invention,<br>
binding specificity and/or overall activity (which may be in terms of delivering a<br>
chemotherapeutic agent to or into cancerous cells to reduce the growth and / or<br>
proliferation of cancer cells, to induce apoptotic cell death in the cancer cell, to<br>
delay the development of metastasis, and/or treating palliatively) is generally<br>
retained, although the extent of activity may vary compared to an antibody-<br>
produced by a deposited hybridoma (may be greater or lesser). The invention<br><br>
also provides methods of making any of these antibodies. Methods of making<br>
antibodies are known in the art and are described herein.<br>
[0133] The invention also provides polypeptides comprising an amino acid<br>
sequence of the antibodies of the invention. In some embodiments, the<br>
polypeptide comprises one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain<br>
variable regions of the antibody. In some embodiments, the polypeptide<br>
comprises one or more of the light chain and/or heavy chain CDRs of the<br>
antibody. In some embodiments, the polypeptide comprises three CDRs of the<br>
light chain and/or heavy chain of the antibody. In some embodiments, the<br>
polypeptide comprises an amino acid sequence of the antibody that has any of<br>
the following: at least 5 contiguous amino acids of a sequence of the original<br>
antibody, at least 8 contiguous amino acids, at least about 10 contiguous amino<br>
acids, at least about 15 contiguous amino acids, at-least about 20 contiguous<br>
, amino acids, at least about 25 contiguous amino acids, at least about 30.-'<br>
'Contiguous amino acids, wherein at least 3 of the amino acids are from a variable<br>
region of the antibody. In one embodiment, the variable region is from a light<br>
chain of the original antibody. In another embodiment, the variable region is<br>
from a heavy chain of the antibody. In another embodiment, the 5 (or more)<br>
contiguous amino acids are from a complementarity-determining region (CDR)<br>
of the antibody.<br>
(0134] In some embodiments of this invention, cells of this invention that express<br>
KID24, a portion of KID24, anti-KID24 antibodies or other KID24-binding<br>
polypeptides of this invention are administered directly to an individual to<br>
modulate that individual's endogenous in vivo KID24 biological activity.<br>
VIII. Methods of using KID24 modulators and anti-KID24: antibodies for therapeutic<br>
purposes<br>
[01351 Monoclonal antibodies to KID24 may be used for therapeutic purposes in<br>
individuals with cancer or other diseases. Therapy with anti-KID24 antibodies<br>
can involve formation of complexes both in vitro and in vivo as described above.<br>
In one embodiment, monoclonal antibody anti-KID24 can bind to and reduce the<br>
proliferation of cancerous cells. It is understood that the antibody is<br><br>
administered at a concentration that promotes binding at physiological {e.g., in<br>
vivo) conditions. In another embodiment, monoclonal antibodies to KID24 can<br>
be used for immunotherapy directed at cancerous cells of different tissues such<br>
as pancreas, colon, lung or prostate and other types of cancer such as sarcoma.<br>
In another embodiment, monoclonal antibody anti-KID24 alone can bind to and<br>
reduce cell division in the cancer cell. In another embodiment, monoclonal<br>
antibody anti-KID24 can bind to cancerous cells and delay the development of<br>
metastasis. In yet another embodiment, an individual with cancer is given<br>
palliative treatment with anti-KID24 antibody. Palliative treatment of a cancer<br>
individual involves treating or lessening the adverse symptoms of the disease, or<br>
iatrogenic symptoms resulting from other treatments given for the disease<br>
without directly affecting the cancer progression. This includes treatments for<br>
easing of pain, nutritional support, sexual problems, psychological distress,<br>
depression, fatigue, psychiatric disorders, nausea, vomiting, etc.<br>
[0136| In such situations, the anti-KID24 antibody may be administered: with<br>
agents that enhance or direct an individual's own immune response, such as an :;<br>
agent that strengthens antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).<br>
[0137] In other embodiments, at least one fucose residue present in an anti-<br>
KID24 antibody is removed from the oligosaccharides of that antibody, a<br>
modification to enhance ADCC. In similar embodiments, fucose residues<br>
present in an anti-KID24 antibody are modified to alter their composition to the<br>
extent required to enhance ADCC compared to the original, unmodified<br>
antibody.<br>
[0138] In yet another embodiment, anti-KID24 antibody be conjugated to or<br>
associated with a radioactive molecule, toxin {e.g., calicheamicin),<br>
chemotherapeutic molecule, liposomes or other vesicles containing<br>
chemotherapeutic compounds and administered to an individual in need of such<br>
treatment to target these compounds to the cancer cell containing the antigen<br>
recognized by the antibody and thus eliminate cancerous or diseased cells.<br>
Without being limited to any particular theory, the anti-KID24: antibody is<br>
internalized by the cell bearing KID24 at its surface, thus delivering the<br>
conjugated moiety to the cell to induce the therapeutic effect. In yet another<br><br>
embodiment, the antibody can be employed as adjuvant therapy at the time of<br>
the surgical removal of a cancer expressing the antigen in order to delay the<br>
development of metastasis. The antibody can also be administered before<br>
surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) in an individual with a tumor expressing the<br>
antigen in order to decrease the size of the tumor and thus enable or simplify<br>
surgery, spare tissue during surgery, and/or decrease the resulting<br>
disfigurement.<br>
[0139] Cell cycle dosing is contemplated in the practice of this invention, m such<br>
embodiments, a chemotherapeutic agent is used to synchronize the cell cycle of<br>
the tumor or other target diseased cells at a pre-determined stage.<br>
Subsequently, administration of the anti-KID24 antibody of this invention (alone<br>
or with an additional therapeutic moiety) is made. In alternative embodiments,<br>
an anti-KID24 antibody is used to synchronize the-cell cycle and reduce cell<br>
division prior to administration of a second round of treatment; the second<br>
round may be administration of an anti-KID24 antibody and/or an additional<br>
therapeutic moiety.<br>
[0140] Chemotherapeutic agents include radioactive molecules, toxins, also<br>
referred to as cytotoxins or cytotoxic agents, which includes any agent that is<br>
detrimental to the viability of cancerous cells, agents, and liposomes or other.<br>
vesicles containing chemotherapeutic compounds. Examples of suitable<br>
chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to 1-dehydrotestosterone, 5-<br>
fluorouracil decarbazine, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, actinomycin D,<br>
adriamycin, aldesleukin, alkylating agents, allopurinol sodium, altretamine,<br>

trastuzumab, tretinoin, valrubicin, vinblastine sulfate, vincristine sulfate, and<br>
vinorelbine tartrate.<br>
[0141] In a preferred embodiment, the cytotoxin is especially effective in dividing<br>
or rapidly dividing cells, such that non-dividing cells are relatively spared from<br>
the toxic effects.<br>
[0142] The antibodies of the invention can be internalized within the diseased or<br>
carcinoma cells to which they bind and are therefore particularly useful for<br>
therapeutic applications, for example, delivering into the cells toxins that need to<br>
be internalized for their adverse activity. Examples of such toxins include, but<br>
not limited to, saporin, calicheamicin, auristatin, and maytansinoid.<br>
[0143] The antibodies or polypeptides of the invention can be associated<br>
(including conjugated or linked) to a radioactive molecule, a toxin, or other<br>
therapeutic agents, or to liposomes or other vesicles containing therapeutic<br>
agents covalently or non-covalently, directly or indirecdy. The antibody may be<br><br>
linked to the radioactive molecule, the toxin, or the chemotherapeutic molecule<br>
at any location along the antibody so long as the antibody is able to bind its<br>
target KID24.<br>
[0144] A toxin or a chemotherapeutic agent may be coupled (e.g., covalently<br>
bonded) to a suitable monoclonal antibody either directly or indirectly (e.g., via a<br>
linker group, or, alternatively, via a linking molecule with appropriate<br>
attachment sites, such as a platform molecule as described in U.S. patent<br>
5,552,391). The toxin and chemotherapeutic agent of the present invention can be<br>
coupled directly to the particular targeting proteins using methods known in the<br>
art. For example, a direct reaction between an agent and an antibody is possible<br>
when each possesses a substituent capable of reacting with the other. For<br>
example, a nucleophilic group, such as an amino or sulfhydryl group, on one<br>
may be capable of reacting with a carbonyl-containing. group, such as an<br>
anhydride or an acid halide; or with an alkyl group containing a good leaving<br>
group (e.g., a halide) on the other.<br>
[0145J The antibodies or polypeptides can also be linked to a chemotherapeutic<br>
agent via a microcarrier. Microcarrier refers to a biodegradable or a non-<br>
biodegradable particle which is insoluble in water and which has a size of less<br>
than about 150,120 or 100 mm in size, more commonly less than about 50-60<br>
um, preferably less than about 10, 5, 2.5, 2 or 1.5 um. Microcarriers include<br>
"nanocarriers", which are microcarriers have a size of less than about 1 um,<br>
preferably less than about 500 nm. Such particles are known in the art. Solid<br>
phase microcarriers may be particles formed from biocompatible naturally<br>
occurring polymers, synthetic polymers or synthetic copolymers, which may<br>
include or exclude microcarriers formed from agarose or cross-linked agarose, as<br>
well as other biodegradable materials known in the art. Biodegradable solid<br>
phase microcarriers may be formed from polymers which are degradable (e.g.,<br>
poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid) and copolymers thereof) or erodible (e.g.,<br>
poly(ortho esters such as 3,9-diethylidene-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane<br>
(DETOSU) or poly(anhydrides), such as poly(anhydrides) of sebacic acid) under<br>
mammalian physiological conditions. Microcarriers may also be liquid phase<br>
(e.g., oil or lipid based), such liposomes, iscoms (immune-stimulating complexes,<br><br>
which are stable complexes of cholesterol, and phospholipid, adjuvant-active<br>
saponin) without antigen, or droplets or micelles found in oil-in-water or water-<br>
in-oil emulsions, provided the liquid phase microcarriers are biodegradable.<br>
Biodegradable liquid phase microcarriers typically incorporate a biodegradable<br>
oil, a number of which are known in the art, including squalene and vegetable<br>
oils. Microcarriers are typically spherical in shape, but microcarriers that deviate<br>
from spherical shape are also acceptable (e.g., ellipsoid, rod-shaped, etc.). Due to<br>
their insoluble nature (with respect to water), microcarriers are filterable from<br>
water and water-based (aqueous) solutions.<br>
[0146] The antibody or polypeptide conjugates of the present invention may<br>
include a bifunctional linker that contains both a group capable of coupling to a<br>
toxic agent or chemotherapeutic agent and a group capable of coupling to the<br>
antibody. A linker can function as a spacer to distance an antibody from an<br>
agent in order to avoid interference with binding capabilities. A linker can be<br>
cleavable or non-deavable.-A linker can also serve to increase the chemical<br>
reactivity of a substituent on an agent or an antibody, and thus increase the<br>
coupling efficiency. An increase in chemical reactivity may also facilitate the use<br>
of agents, or functional groups on agents, which otherwise would not be<br>
possible. The bifunctional linker can be coupled to the antibody by means that<br>
are known in the art. For example, a linker containing an active ester moiety,<br>
such as an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, can be used for coupling to lysine<br>
residues in the antibody via an amide linkage. In another example, a linker<br>
containing a nucleophilic amine or hydrazine residue can be coupled to aldehyde<br>
groups produced by glycolytic oxidation of antibody carbohydrate residues. In<br>
addition to these direct methods of coupling, the linker can be indirectiy coupled<br>
to the antibody by means of an intermediate carrier such as an aminodextran. In<br>
these embodiments the modified linkage is via either lysine, carbohydrate, or an<br>
intermediate carrier. In one embodiment, the linker is coupled site-selectively to<br>
free thiol residues in the protein. Moieties that are suitable for selective coupling<br>
to thiol groups on proteins are well known in the art. Examples include disulfide<br>
compounds, a-halocarbonyl and a-halocarboxyl compounds, and maleimides.<br>
When a nucleophilic amine function is present in the same molecule as an a-halo<br><br>
carbonyl or carboxyl group the potential exists for cyclization to occur via<br>
intramolecular alkylation of the amine. Methods to prevent this problem are well<br>
known to one of ordinary skill in the art, for example by preparation of<br>
molecules in which the amine and a-halo functions are separated by inflexible<br>
groups, such as aryl groups or trans-alkenes, that make the undesired cyclization<br>
stereochemically disfavored. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,441,163 for<br>
preparation of conjugates of maytansinoids and antibody via a disulfide moiety.<br>
[0147J One of the cleavable linkers that can be used for the preparation of<br>
antibody-drug conjugates is an acid-labile linker based on cis-aconitic acid that<br>
takes advantage of the acidic environment of different intracellular<br>
compartments such as the endosomes encountered during receptor mediated<br>
endocytosis and the lysosomes. See, for example, Shen et al, Biochem. Biophys.<br>
Res. Commun, 102:1048-1054 (1981) for the preparation of conjugates of<br>
daunorubicin with macromolecuiar carriers; Yang et al., J.Natl. Cane. Inst.<br>
80:1154-1159 (1988) for the preparation df conjugates of daunorubicin to an anti-<br>
melanoma antibody; Dillman et al, Cancer Res. 48:6097-6102 (1988) for using an<br>
acid-labile linker in a similar fashion to prepare conjugates of daunorubicin with<br>
an anti-T cell antibody; Trouet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 79:626-629 (1982) for<br>
linking daunorubicin to an antibody via a peptide spacer arm.<br>
(01481 An antibody (or polypeptide) of this invention may be conjugated (linked)<br>
to a radioactive molecule by any method known to the art. For a discussion of<br>
methods for radiolabeling antibody see "Cancer Therapy with Monoclonal<br>
AntibodiesT", D. M. Goldenberg ed. (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1995).<br>
[0149] Alternatively, an antibody can be conjugated to a second antibody to<br>
form an antibody heteroconjugate as described by Segal in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,676,980. The formation of cross-linked antibodies can target the immune<br>
system to specific types of cells, for example, cancer or diseased cells expressing<br>
KID24.<br>
[0150] This invention also provides methods of preventing or delaying<br>
development of metastasis in an individual who has or has had a primary tumor<br>
(including, but not limited to, pancreatic, colon, lung, or prostate cancers) by<br>
administering an anti-KID24 antibody or other KID24 modulator. This<br><br>
modulator may be given alone or in conjunction with other therapies, such as<br>
radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery. In certain preferred embodiments, the<br>
primary tumor has been subjected to at least one round of surgery, radiation,<br>
and/or chemotherapy before administration of the KID24 modulator. In some<br>
circumstances, the primary tumor may appear to have been completely<br>
removed by the prior treatment. In other embodiments, the KID24 modulator is<br>
administered prior to or concurrent with treatment of the individual with<br>
surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. In some embodiments, these methods<br>
of preventing or delaying development of metastases in an individual who has<br>
or has had cancer comprise administration of a KID24 modulator (such as an<br>
antibody that bind to KID24) in conjunction with (or linked to) another<br>
therapeutic moiety such as a detectable marker or chemotherapeutic agent. In<br>
some embodiments, the antibody is a humanized_or chimeric form of a non-<br>
human anti-KID24 antibody.	'.:.!;; ■■■'■ -:<br>
[0151J In yet another embodiment, the antibody can be employed as adjuvant<br>
therapy at the time of the surgical removal of a cancer expressing the antigen in<br>
order to delay the development of metastasis. The antibody or antibody<br>
associated with a chemotherapeutic agent can also be administered before<br>
surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) in an individual with a tumor expressing the<br>
antigen in order to decrease the size of the tumor and thus enable or simplify<br>
surgery, spare tissue during surgery, and/or decrease the resulting<br>
disfigurement.<br>
[0152] In another embodiment, any of the KID24 modulators, such as an anti-<br>
KID24 antibody, can be employed as a therapy after the treatment (e.g., surgical,<br>
radiotherapy, chemotherapeutic treatment, etc.) of a primary tumor in order to<br>
delay or prevent the development of metastases. The KID24 modulator may be<br>
administered alone or linked to a chemotherapeutic agent. In some<br>
embodiments, the antibody is a humanized or chimeric form of a non-human<br>
anti-KID24 antibody.<br>
[0153) In yet another embodiment, any of the KID24 binding embodiments<br>
described herein can bind to KID24-expressing cancerous cells and induces an<br>
active immune response against the cancerous cells expressing KTD24. In some<br><br>
cases, the active immune response can cause the death of the cancerous cells (e.g.,<br>
antibody binding to cancer cells inducing apoptotic cell death), or inhibit the<br>
growth {e.g., block cells cycle progression) of the cancerous cells. In other cases,<br>
any of the novel antibodies described herein can bind to cancerous cells and<br>
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) can eliminate cancerous cells to<br>
which anti-KID24 binds. Accordingly, the invention provides methods of<br>
stimulating an immune response comprising administering any of the<br>
compositions described herein.<br>
[0154] In some cases, antibody binding can also activate both cellular and<br>
humoral immune responses and recruit more natural killer cells or increased<br>
production of cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IFN-g, IL-12, TNF-a, TNF-b, etc.) that further<br>
activate an individual's immune system to destroy cancerous cells. In yet<br>
another embodiment, anti-KID24 antibodies can bind-to cancerous cells, and<br>
macrophages or other phagocytic cell can opsonize the cancerous cells.<br>
[0155] Various formulations of anti-KID24 antibodies or fragments-thereof may '<br>
be used for administration. In some embodiments, anti-KID24 antibodies or<br>
fragments thereof may be administered neat. In addition to the<br>
pharmacologically active agent, the compositions of the present invention may<br>
contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and<br>
auxiliaries that are well known in the art and are relatively inert substances that<br>
facilitate administration of a pharmacologically effective substance or which<br>
facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used<br>
pharmaceutically for delivery to the site of action. For example, an excipient can<br>
give form or consistency, or act as a diluent. Suitable excipients include but are<br>
not limited to stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for<br>
varying osmolarity, encapsulating agents, buffers, and skin penetration<br>
enhancers.<br>
[0156J Suitable formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous<br>
solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, for example, water-<br>
soluble salts. In addition, suspensions of the active,compounds as appropriate for<br>
oily injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or<br>
vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters,<br><br>
for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides. Aqueous injection suspensions may<br>
contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension and include, for<br>
example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, and/or dextran. Optionally,<br>
the suspension may also contain stabilizers. Liposomes can also be used to<br>
encapsulate the agent for delivery into the cell.<br>
[0157] The pharmaceutical formulation for systemic administration according to<br>
the invention may be formulated for enteral, parenteral or topical<br>
administration. Indeed, all three types of formulation may be used<br>
simultaneously to achieve systemic administration of the active ingredient.<br>
Excipients as well as formulations for parenteral and nonparenteral drug<br>
delivery are set forth in Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed.<br>
Mack Publishing (2000).<br>
[0158]. Suitable formulations for oral administration include hard or soft gelatin<br>
capsules, pills, tablets, including coated tablets, elixirs, suspensions, syrups or ;•■<br>
inhalations and controlled release forms thereof.<br>
[0159] Generally, these agents are formulated for administration by injection<br>
{e.g., intraperitoneally, intravenously, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, etc.),<br>
although other forms of administration (e.g., oral, mucosal, etc) can be also used.<br>
Accordingly, anti-KID24 antibodies are preferably combined with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles such as saline, Ringer's solution, dextrose<br>
solution, and the like.<br>
[0160] The particular dosage regimen, i.e., dose, timing and repetition, will<br>
depend on the particular individual and that individual's medical history.<br>
Generally, a dose of at least about 100 ug/kg body weight, more preferably at<br>
least about 250 ug/kg body weight, even more preferably at least about 750<br>
ug/kg body weight, even more preferably at least about 3 mg /kg body weight,<br>
even more preferably at least about 5 mg /kg body weight, even more<br>
preferably at least about 10 mg/kg body weight is administered.<br>
[0161] Empirical considerations, such as the half-life, generally will contribute to<br>
the determination of the dosage. Antibodies, which are compatible with the<br>
human immune system, such as humanized antibodies or fully human<br>
antibodies, may be used to prolong half-life of the antibody and to prevent the<br><br>
antibody being attacked by the host's immune system. Frequency of<br>
administration may be determined and adjusted over the course of therapy, and<br>
is based on reducing the number of cancerous cells, maintaining the reduction of<br>
cancerous cells, reducing the proliferation of cancerous cells, or delaying the<br>
development of metastasis. Alternatively, sustained continuous release<br>
formulations of anti-KID24 antibodies may be appropriate. Various<br>
formulations and devices for achieving sustained release are known in the art.<br>
[0162| In one embodiment, dosages for anti-KID24 antibodies may be<br>
determined empirically in individuals who have been given one or more<br>
administration(s). Individuals are given incremental dosages of an anti-KID24<br>
antibody. To assess efficacy of anti-KID24 antibodies, a marker of the specific<br>
cancer disease state can be followed. These include direct measurements of<br>
tumor size via palpation or visual observation, indirect measurement of tumor<br>
size by. x-ray or other imaging techniques; an improvement as assessed by direct? V<br>
tumor biopsy and microscopic examination of the tumor sample; the<br>
measurement of an indirect tumor marker {e.g., PSA for prostate cancer), a<br>
decrease in pain or paralysis; improved speech, vision, breathing or other<br>
disability associated with the tumor; increased appetite; or an increase in quality<br>
of life as measured by accepted tests or prolongation of survival. It will be<br>
apparent to one of skill in the art that the dosage will vary depending on the<br>
individual, the type of cancer, the stage of cancer, whether the cancer has begun<br>
to metastasize to other location in the individual, and the past and concurrent<br>
treatments being used.<br>
[0163] Other formulations include suitable delivery forms known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to, carriers such as liposomes. See, for example,<br>
Mahato et al. (1997) Pharm. Res. 14:853-859. Liposomal preparations include, but<br>
are not limited to, cytofectins, multilamellar vesicles and unilamellar vesicles.<br>
[0164J In some embodiments, more than one antibody may be present. The<br>
antibodies can be monoclonal or polyclonal. Such compositions may contain at<br>
least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five different antibodies<br>
that are reactive against carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, or<br>
adenosarcomas. Anti-KID24 antibody can be admixed with one or more<br><br>
antibodies reactive against carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, or<br>
adenosarcomas in organs including but not limited to ovary, breast, lung,<br>
prostate, colon, kidney, skin, thyroid, bone, upper digestive tract, and pancreas.<br>
In one embodiment, a mixture of different anti-KID24 antibodies is used. A<br>
mixture of antibodies, as they are often denoted in the art, may be particularly<br>
useful in treating a broader range of population of individuals.<br>
[0165] The following examples are provided to illustrate, but not to limit, the<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Preparation of human kidney cells as an imtnunogen<br>
10166] Human fetal kidneys of gestational age between 10 to 18 weeks were<br>
obtained from Advanced Biosciences Research atAlarneda County, California.<br>
Kidneys were, procured and shipped to the lab in tissue culture medium on wet<br>
ice. Immediately; upon arrival, the kidneys were transferred to wash medium<br>
(cold PBS containing penicillin/streptomycin and gentamycin). The outer<br>
membranes were removed with forceps and the kidneys were briefly washed in<br>
70% ethanol then rinsed twice in wash medium. -The kidneys were minced into 1<br>
mm cubes with surgical scissors in a 100 mm dry culture dish. The tissue pieces<br>
were plated in 10 ml of a defined serum-free medium referred to herein as I/3F.<br>
This media is described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/504,674, the<br>
disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. While a variety of<br>
commonly used cell culture media may be used in the practice of this invention,<br>
presently preferred embodiments use serum-free, fructose-based cell culture<br>
media.<br>
[0167] The tissue pieces were transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and the<br>
tissue pieces were centrifuged at lOOOxg for 5 minutes. The tissue pieces were<br>
resuspended in I/3F medium containing insulin (10 ug/ml), transferrin (10<br>
ug/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), somatotropin (0.005 IU/ml), pig<br>
pituitary extract (0.2%), chicken serum (0.1%), gentamycin (100 ug/ml),<br>
penicillin /streptomycin (lx) and collagenase/dispase (0.1%) and incubated at<br>
4°C overnight. The following day, centrifuge the digested tissue pieces were<br><br>
centrifuged at lOOOxg for 5 minutes and washed twice with I/3F medium. The<br>
pellet was resuspended in 10 ml I/3F medium containing insulin (10 ug/ml),<br>
transferrin (10 ug/ml), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml), somatotropin (0.005<br>
IU/ml), pig pituitary extract (0.2%) and chicken serum (0.1%) and cultured in<br>
fibronectin-precoated 10 cm plates.<br>
{0168] Under these culture conditions, the human fetal kidney cells attached to<br>
the substrate-coated plates and grew as a monolayer. Culture medium was<br>
changed twice weekly.<br>
[0169] To harvest the cells, the cell monolayers were rinsed once with calcium-<br>
and magnesium-free Hanks saline solution, incubated in lOmM EDTA in Hanks<br>
saline solution at 37C for 15 minutes. The cells were detached from the culture<br>
surface by gentle pipetting. The cell suspension was pelleted by centrifugation at<br>
lOOOxg for 5 minutes. The supernatant was rem.oved.and cells were resuspended<br>
in serum-free medium (I/3F medium) with non-denaturing adjuvant as<br>
appropriate.<br>
Example 2. Generation of monoclonal antibodies<br>
[0170] A non-denaturing adjuvant (Ribi, R730, Corixa, Hamilton MT) was<br>
rchydrated to 2 ml in phosphate buffered saline. 100 /.il of this rehydrated<br>
adjuvant was then gently mixed with some of the cell pellet from Example 1 to<br>
be used for immunization. Approximately 106 human fetal kidney cells per<br>
mouse were injected into Balb/c mice via footpad, approximately once or twice a<br>
week. The precise immunization schedule is as follows: Day zero, immunization<br>
plus Ribi. Day 3, immunization plus Ribi. Day 7, immunization plus Ribi. Day 24,<br>
immunization minus Ribi. Day 29, immunization minus Ribi. Day 32,<br>
immunization minus Ribi. Day 36, immunization minus Ribi. Day 44,<br>
immunization minus Ribi. Day 51, immunization minus Ribi. Day 69, bleed for<br>
titer test. Day 71. immunization plus Ribi. Day 74, immunization plus Ribi. Day<br>
81, immunization plus Ribi. Day 91, prefusion boost (no Ribi). Day 104, harvest<br>
nodes for fusion.<br>
[0171] At Day 69, a drop of blood was drawn from the tail of each immunized<br>
animal to test the titer of antibodies against human fetal kidney cells using FACS<br>
analysis. When the titer reached at least 1:2000, the mice were sacrificed using<br><br>
CO, followed by cervical dislocation. Lymph nodes were harvested for<br>
hybridoma preparation.<br>
[0172J Lymphocytes from mice were fused with the mouse myeloma line X63-<br>
Ag8.653 using 35% polyethylene glycol 4000. On day 10 following the fusion, the<br>
hybridoma supernatants were screened for the presence of human fetal kidney<br>
ceils- specific monoclonal antibodies by fluorescence activated cell sorting<br>
(FACS). Conditioned medium from each hybridoma was incubated for 30<br>
minutes with an aliquot of human fetal kidney cells. After incubation, the cell<br>
samples were washed, resuspended in 0.1 ml diluent and incubated with 1 ug / ml<br>
of FITC conjugated F(ab')2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 4°C.<br>
The cells were washed, resuspended in. 0.2 ml FACS diluent and analyzed using a<br>
FACScan cell analyzer (Becton Dickinson; San Jose, CA). Hybridoma clones<br>
were selected for further expansion, cloning, and characterization based on their<br>
binding to the surface of the human fetal kidney cells by FACS. A hybridoma<br>
making a monoclonal antibody designated mu-anti-KID24 was selected, which<br>
binds an antigen designated KID24. The hybridoma making mu-anti-KID24<br>
antibodies was further expanded in growth medium suitable for sustaining<br>
hybridoma growth and antibody purification.<br>
Example 3. Purification ofanti-KID24 antibodies, including mu-anti-KID24<br>
{0173] Human fetal kidney cells were detached from tissue culture flasks in the<br>
presence of 10.0 mM EDTA, centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 5 minutes and<br>
resuspended in PBS containing 1% BSA and 2mM EDTA (FACS diluent). The cells<br>
were counted and adjusted to 107 cells/ml. About 0.1 ml of cells were incubated<br>
with lOOul FACS diluent for 30 minutes at 37°C. Monoclonal antibodies that bind<br>
to human fetal kidney cells were purified from tissue culture supernatant using<br>
protein-G affinity chromatography. The tissue culture supernatant may be first<br>
passed through a bovine IgG column to remove excess bovine IgG in the<br>
supernatant if desired. The following materials were used for the antibody<br>
purification process: hybridoma tissue culture supernatant, Immunopure (G) IgG<br>
binding buffer (Pierce #21011 Rockford, IL), Immunopure IgG Elution Buffer<br>
(Pierce #21009), concentrated HC1 (for adjusting pH), Coming 1 liter PES<br><br>
(polyether sulfone), 0.22 urn filter (Corning #431098, Corning, NY), Amersham<br>
Pharmacia AKTA Explorer System (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ),<br>
Protein-G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences tt 17-0618-03), Stripping<br>
buffer consisting of 3M Potassium thiocyanate/50mM Tris pH 7.8, and PBS<br>
(phosphate buffered saline), 3M Tris pH 9.0.<br>
[0174} To purify the mouse anti-human KID24 antibody referred to herein as<br>
mu-anti-KID24, the volume of the supernatant was measured and an equal<br>
volume of binding buffer was added to the supernatant. The mixture was<br>
allowed to equilibrate to room temperature. The supernatant was clarified by<br>
passage through a 0.22 urn filter. The supernatant was loaded onto a protein-G<br>
Sepharose column using the AKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences)<br>
and then washed with 5-10 column volumes of binding buffer. The monoclonal<br>
antibody was eluted with the elution buffer, and fractions were collected. The<br>
fractions were neutralized upon elution with the addition of 3M Tris, pH 9.0 to<br>
empty tubes (1/60 volume of the fractions). The peak fractions containing the<br>
monoclonal antibody were pooled. The pooled samples was injected into a pre-<br>
wetted slidealyzer cassette (10,000 MW cutoff; Pierce #66810) and dialyzed in lx<br>
PBS at 4°C (with 3 buffer changes of at least 4 hours of dialysis per change). The<br>
purified monoclonal antibody was sterile filtered (0.2u.m Acrodisc) and stored at<br>
2-8°C.<br>
[0175] A sample of purified antibody was taken for determination of<br>
concentration by UV absorbance (A280) and SDS-polyacrylimide gel<br>
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE was run under both non-reducing and<br>
reducing conditions for analysis of molecular weight, identification of the typical<br>
banding pattern of monoclonal antibodies and assessment of purity.<br>
[0176| After purification of the mu-anti-KID24 monoclonal antibody from the<br>
hybridoma supernatant, it was re-tested for binding to human fetal kidney cells.<br>
The cell samples were prepared as described above and incubated with the<br>
purified antibody at various concentrations. After incubation the cells were<br>
washed, resuspended in 0.1 ml diluent and incubated with lug of FITC<br>
conjugated F(ab)'2 fragment of goat anti-mouse IgG for 30 minutes at 4°C. The<br>
cells were washed, resuspended in 0.5 ml FACS diluent and analyzed using a<br><br>
FACScan cell sorter (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). A shift to the right on the<br>
FACScan histogram indicated that the purified antibody still bound to human<br>
fetal kidney cells.<br>
[0177] In other experiments, the binding of the mu-anti-KID24 antibody to<br>
KID24 was tested using live cell ELBA. The following method was used,<br>
although other methods commonly known in the field are applicable. Cells (HT-<br>
29, SKOV3, SKMES-1, SW480, SKBR-3, and HPAFII) were grown in 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (FBS) containing media to confluency on tissue culture treated 96-<br>
well plates (Falcon). Cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with 50i.il of<br>
desired antibodies at a desired concentration in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution<br>
(HBSS) containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide for 1 hour at room<br>
temperature. The cells were then washed three times with lOOul per well of HBSS<br>
before incubating with horseradish peroxidase (H'RP) "secondary antibody (50ul<br>
per well diluted in HBSS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The cells were<br>
finally washed three times with HBSS and the color change substrate (TMB<br>
substrate, KPL) was added to each well at 100f.il per well. The color change<br>
reaction was stopped with the addition of lOOul per well of 1M phosphoric acid.<br>
The flates were then read at O.D. 450nm. The results are summarized below in<br>
Table 4.<br>
Example 4. Immunoprecipitation analysis o/KID24 expression in cancer cell line A49S.<br>
[0178] Kidney carcinoma cell line A498 was grown to confluency on 175 cm2<br>
culture dishes. The cells were rinsed with PBS and then scraped in lysis buffer<br>
(HBSS+ with 2% Triton X-100,2mM PMSF, 0.1% sodium azide, and 1 tablet per<br>
5ml lysis buffer of EDTA free complete mini-protease cocktail (Roche Molecular<br>
Biochemicals)) and the lysates collected. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 x g<br>
for one hour at 4°C. The clarified lysate was then pre-cleared for 2 hours at 4°C<br>
with 5 (xl of human IgG conjugated (lmg/ml) CNBr 4MB Sepharose beads<br>
(Amersham Pharmacia). Human IgG beads were centrifuged and removed, and<br>
then the pre-cleared lysate was then incubated with monoclonal antibody mu-<br>
anti-KID24 conjugated to CNBr 4MB sepharose beads (conjugated at lmg/ml)<br>
for 2 hours at 4°C. The mu-anti-KID24 beads were centrifuged and removed<br><br>
after the 2 hour incubation. Both the human IgG and the mu-anti-I<td24 beads></td24>
were individually washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and then washed<br>
three times with 1ml HBSS-K The washed beads were eluted by the addition of 30<br>
(xl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling at 99°C for 5 minutes.<br>
[0179] The samples were then resolved on a 4-20% Novex gradient gel<br>
(Invitrogen), and transferred onto 0.2jxm nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen)<br>
and visualized by western blotting with either 5 (.tg/blot of mu-anti-KID24 or<br>
5ug/blot of goat-anti-ADAM-9 antibodies.<br>
(0180| For detection with HRP conjugated streptavidin, the nitrocellulose was<br>
first blocked for 1 hour with blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk in Tris<br>
buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST, Sigma Chemicals). HRP<br>
conjugated streptavidin was diluted into PBST at 1 u.g/ml and exposed to the<br>
nitrocellulose for 30 minutes at room temperature? The nitrocellulose was then<br>
■ washed three times with PBST before visualization with ECC41. '<br>
'[0181] Results using this protocol and mu-anti-KID24 antibodies show a'specific<br>
molecular weight band at approximately 75 kDa under reducing conditions. A<br>
specific band at the same molecular weight was also present when goat-anti-<br>
ADAM-9 antibodies were used. The result from, this experiment is shown in.<br>

Example 5. Qiaracterization of the antigen to which mu-anti-KID24 binds using<br>
Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS I MS)<br>
[0182] The antigen to which mu-anti-KID24 binds is isolated and subject to<br>
Tandem mass spectroscopy according to the method of Kane et al., / Bio Chem.<br>
2002 June 21; 277(25): 22115-8. Proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel<br>
was stained with a colloidal Coomassie Blue reagent (Invitrogen). The proteins<br>
of interest were digested in the gel with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were<br>
sequenced by microcapillary liquid chromatography MS/MS on an ion trap mass<br>
spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan LCDQ DECA XP), as described in Wu et al,<br>
Nature 405: 477-82 (2000). Alternatively, other commonly known methods of<br>
mass spectrometry/ such as MALDI mass spectrometry can also be used in the<br>
practice of this invention.<br><br>
Example 6. Immunohistochemistni methods<br>
[0183] Frozen tissue samples from cancer patients were embedded in OCT<br>
compound and quick-frozen in isopentane with dry ice. Cryosections were cut<br>
with a Leica 3050 CM mictrotome at thickness of 8-10 um and thaw-mounted on<br>
SuperFrost Plus slides (VWR #48311-703). The sections were fixed with 75%<br>
acetone/25% ethanol at 10°C and allowed to air-dry 2-4 hours at room<br>
temperature. The fixed sections were stored at -80°C until use.<br>
[0184] For immunohistochemistry, the tissue sections were retrieved washed in<br>
Tris buffered 0.05% Tween (TB-T) and blocked in blocking buffer (TB-T, 5%<br>
normal goat serum and 100u.g/ml avidin) for 30 minutes at room temperature.<br>
The slides were then incubated with the mu-anti-KTD24 and control monoclonal<br>
antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1 /.tg/ml) for-60-90 minutes at room	• *<br>
temperature. The sections were then washed three times with the blocking	•<br>
buffer. The bound monoclonal antibodies were detected with a goat anti-mouse<br>
IgG + IgM (H+L) F(ab')2-peroxidase conjugates and the peroxidase substrate<br>
diaminobenzidine (1 mg/ml, Sigma cat. No. D 5637) in 0.1 M sodium acetate<br>
buffer pH 5.05 and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (Sigma cat. No. H1009). The<br>
stained slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin and examined under<br>
Nikon microscope.<br>
[0185] I11 some cases, paraffin embedded formaldehyde-fixed tissues may be<br>
used for immunohistochemistry after appropriate antigen retrieval methods<br>
were employed. One such antigen retrieval method is described in Mangham<br>
and Isaacson, Histopathology 35:129-33 (1999). Other methods of antigen retrieval<br>
and/or detection may be used by one skilled in the art. Results from<br>
experiments performed using frozen tissues or, where appropriate, fixed tissue<br>
with antigen retrieval and polyMICA detection were performed. The binding of<br>
anti-KID24 antibody to a variety of normal and cancer tissues was assessed. In<br>
all cases, antibody binding in control fixed tissues was correlated with that of<br><br>
frozen tissues. The results from frozen tissues were only used if the two did not<br>
match in the controls.<br>
(0186| For convenience, a summary of the combined results of several<br>
experiments using frozen surgical tissue from different sources is shown below<br>
in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3.<br><br><br>
Example 7. Immunocytochemistrii results<br>
[0187] Monoclonal antibody mu-anti-KID24 was used to test reactivity with<br>
various cell lines from different types of tissues. The results were scored as '+'<br>
for weak positive staining,'++' for moderate positive staining, '+-i-t-' for strong<br>
positive staining and '-' for negative staining.<br>
[0188] Immunohistochemistry results were obtained using CellArray™<br>
technology, as described in WO 01/43869. Cells from different established cell<br>
lines were removed from the growth surface without using proteases, packed<br>
and embedded in OCT compound. The cells were frozen and sectioned, then<br>
stained using a standard IHC protocol.<br>

[0190] Additional normal human and tumor cell lines were tested for mu-antt-<br>
KID24 binding using standard flow cytometry protocols that are well known in<br>
the field. The results are summarized in Table 5 below.<br><br>
Example 8. Mn-anti-KID24 binds to immobilized human ADAM-9.<br>
[0191] Further characterization of mu-anti-KID24 was performed using standard<br>
ELISA procedures and purllTed'KuXan ADAM-9. Briefly, purified human<br>
ADAM-9 was coated onto 96-well plates at a saturating concentration. Dose<br>
curve of mu-anti-KID24 were allowed to bind (0-150ng/well) and mu-anti-KID24<br>
antibodies that bound to ADAM-9 were visualized using standard ELISA<br>
protocols. The results showed that mu-anti-KID24 bound to purified human<br>
ADAM-9 in a dose responsive manner. These results are consistent with<br><br>
previous Western blot results (See Example 4 above) that showed that mu-anti-<br>
KID24 can immunoprecipitate an anti-ADAM-9 specific band.<br>
Example 9. Mu-anti-KlDU can block ADAMS enzyme activity in vitro.<br>
(01921 In vitro enzyme activity assays were performed using recombinant<br>
human ADAM-9 extra-cellular domain (ECD) and mu-anti-KID24 antibodies.<br>
ADAM-9 ECD is able to cleave a peptide substrate (R&amp;D Systems #E<br>
S003) in the presence of zinc in vitro. Once cleaved, the peptide emits a<br>
fluorogenic signal that can be detected using a fluorescence plate reader at an<br>
excitation wavelength of 320nm (and an emission wavelength at 405nxn). The in<br>
vitro enzyme assay was performed according to manufacturer's protocol.<br>
Briefly, 200ng/rxn of rhADAM-9 ECD (R&amp;D Systems #939-AD-020) was added<br>
to 25 mM Tris, 2.5 uM ZnCl2, and 0.005% Brij 35 at a pH 9.0. Various<br>
concentrations of mu-anti-KID24 were also added.and this reaction was<br>
incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature with mild agitation. 10 uM<br>
fluorogenic peptide substrate (R&amp;D Systems #ES003) was added so that the final<br>
volume was 100 ^1/ well. The reaction was incubated overnight at 37°C. The<br>
plates were then read on a fluorescence plate reader at O.D. 405nm.. Control<br>
conditions (no enzyme) with no ADAM-9 ECM showed no fluorescence, which<br>
was expected because the substrate is only fluorogenic if cleaved. Positive<br>
control conditions with no mu-anti-KID24 showed maximal fluorescence. Mu-<br>
anti-KID24 was able to block ADAM-9 ECM activity in a dose dependent<br>
manner. These results showed that mu-anti-KID24 can block ADAM-9 enzyme<br>
activity in vitro.<br>
Example 10. Mu-anti-KlD24: is able to inhibit soft agar colony formation with colon<br>
tumor cell lines HCT116. SW620 and HT29.<br>
[0193] The in vitro effects of mu-anti-KID24 were tested on three colon tumor cell<br>
lines, HCT116, SW620 and HT29. Standard protocols for soft agar colony<br>
formation, well known in the art, were used. Mu-anti-KID24, at a final<br>
concentration of 1 jAg/ml was able to inhibit soft agar colony formation of<br>
HCT116 cells approximately 60% as compared to control. Similar results were<br><br>
seen with SVV620 cells (14% inhibition as compared to control) and HT29 cells<br>
(22% inhibition as compared to control).<br>
Example 11. Internalization ofmu-anti-KlD24 and toxin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG.<br>
[0194] Mab-ZAP (Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, CA) is an anti-mouse<br>
IgG conjugated to saporin, a toxin that inhibits protein synthesis. This toxin is<br>
impermeable to the cell membrane. If a monoclonal antibody is bound to a cell-<br>
surface antigen that is intemalizable, the toxin-conjugate can bind to the bound<br>
monoclonal and be internalized, eventually killing the cell. Being dependent<br>
upon internalization for demonstration of toxic activity, the Mab-ZAP can serve<br>
to evaluate whether or not a given surface antigen will serve as a suitable target<br>
for any toxin that is dependent upon internalization to express cell toxic effects.<br>
As such, the Mab-ZAP serves as a model for sucfrirtternalization-dependent<br>
toxins such as maytansinoids and chalicheamicins.	•. ,x ;<br>
[01951 For testing the internalization of mu-anti-KID24 and saporin conjugated<br>
anti-mouse IgG by tumor cells and effect of killing the tumor cells after<br>
internalization of saporin, human ovarian carcinoma cell line ES-2 and human<br>
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line HPAF-II were removed from stock flasks<br>
with 10 mM EDTA and centrifuged. Cells were resuspended at 50,000 cells/ml in<br>
the appropriate growth medium and 100 ul plated per well in 96-well plates.<br>
Antibody mu-anti-KID24 was added immediately to the appropriate wells as a<br>
lOx concentrate, to make a final concentration of 10 fxg/ml. After 15 minutes at<br>
room temperature, Mab-ZAP (Cat. # IT-04) was added to appropriate wells as<br>
lOx concentrate to make final concentrations from 0.001 nM to 10 nM. After 4<br>
days of growth, MTT was added (stock 5 mg/ml in PBS, 1:10 dilution in well) for<br>
4 hours at 37°C. The medium was then removed from all wells and 100 ul/ well<br>
DMSO was added. The plates were gently swirled to solubilize the blue MTT<br>
precipitate and the plates were read in a plate reader at O.D. 540 nm.<br>
[0196] There was a decrease in MTT staining in both ES-2 and HPAF-II cells in the<br>
presence of mu-anti-KID24 as compared to the staining in the absence of mu-<br>
anti-KID24 when Mab-ZAP was added above 0.01 nM, indicating the growth of<br>
human cancer cells ES-2 and HPAF-II was inhibited in the presence of mu-anti-<br><br>
KID24 and Mab-ZAP and mu-anti-KID24 and toxin conjugated anti-mouse IgG<br>
were internalized. Results of an internalization experiment according to the<br>
methods of this Example are shown in Figure 2, showing that mu-anti-KID24 is<br>
internalized.<br>
Example 12. Anti-tumor Efficacy of mu-anti-KID24 antibody in a Subcutaneous Flank<br>
Model of Human Tumors.<br>
[0197] This study was designed to test the dose-responsive anti-tumor activity<br>
for an anti-KID24 antibody in a subcutaneous flank model using human tumors<br>
consisting of D54 cells (glioma cell line).<br>
[0198] Cultured D54 cells were suspended in Matrigel (phenol red free, Becton<br>
Dickinson Biosciences Discovery Labware) and PBS (1:1) solution at a density of<br>
5x 105 cells and were implanted at the flank of a nude mouse via a subcutaneous<br>
injection. At Day 19-post inoculation, the resulting xenografts were i,<br>
approximately 100 mm3 and mice were randomly grouped, weighed and treated ■
with either lOOmg/kg mu-anli-KID24 antibody or MAb control. Antibodies<br>
were administered by IP injection three times per week. Sham injection of<br>
vehicle was given to control group for equalizing the stress produced by dosing.<br>
Animals were examined daily during treatment and mean tumor volume (MTV)<br>
was estimated three times per week. Animal toxicity was assessed by<br>
determination of changes in body weight and mortality.<br>
[0199] Mu-anti-KID24 treated mice had a significantly smaller tumor size<br>
(approximately 45% smaller, p
antibody treated mice at the end of the study (42 days post-inoculation). Similar<br>
trends were also observed at the 60 mg/kg dose of mu-anti-KID24 antibody.<br>
[0200] Additional experiments using human fibrosarcoma ceils, HT1080, were<br>
also performed in SCID-Beige mice. 5x 105 cells were suspended in PBS and<br>
mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (phenol red free, Becton Dickinson<br>
Biosciences Discovery Labware) and inoculated into the flanks of SCID-Beige<br>
mice. At 5 days post-inoculation, mice were treated with IP injections of vehicle<br>
(PBS), 100 mg/kg control antibody or 100 mg/kg mu-anti-KID24 antibody.<br>
Tumor volumes are expressed as mean ± SEM, n=10 animals/group. Percent<br><br>
inhibition of tumor growth as measured by tumor size was determined at die<br>
end of the study (16 days post-inoculation).<br>

smaller, p
Example 13. Anti-tumor and anti-metastasis efficacy of mu-anti-KlD24 antibody in a<br>
sub-renal capsule tumor model.<br>
(0202] This study was designed to test the dose-responsive anti-tumor activity<br>
for an anti-KI.D24 antibody in a sub-renal capsule tumor model using Merkel<br>
cells cultured from a Merkel cell carcinoma (neuroendocrine cancer of the skin).<br>
[0203] Type I rat-tail collagen was prepared by a standard method. Briefly, tails<br>
from mature breeding rats were removed and the tendons were isolated and<br>
weighed. One gram of tendon produces 100 ml collagen solution, and each tail<br>
. .tendons were placed in a dilute acetic acid solution (200 ul glacial acetic acid per ■,<br>
gram of tendon in 100 ml water) containing penicillin, streptomycin and<br>
fungizone and stirred gently at 4°C for at least one week. The solution was then<br>
centrifuged and the collagen supernatant was stored at 4°C until use.<br>
[0204] For this study, 50 ul collagen buttons were prepared by polymerizing the<br>
rat-tail collagen in a setting solution containing Earle's Balanced Salt Solution<br>
(EBSS), NaOH and NaHC03. Following polymerization, 5 x 10s Merkel cells<br>
were added per collagen button. The cells were incubated in collagen overnight<br>
at 37°C prior to implantation.<br>
[0205] For implantation of the cells under the kidney capsule, mice were fully<br>
anesthetized with tribromoethanol. A pocket was made in the kidney capsule to<br>
allow for the placement of cells, which was made through a paralumbar surgical<br>
approach to the right and/or left kidney. In some studies, both kidneys received<br>
xenografts. Following surgery, the animals were allowed to recover on a heated<br>
surface and observed until fully recovered from the anesthesia. Wound clips<br>
were removed ten days post-surgery.<br>
[0206] For each treatment dose group, mu-anti-KID24 was diluted in PBS to the<br>
appropriate concentration to administer 0.01 ml/gram body weight. Control<br><br>
groups received PBS (0.01 ml /gram body weight). Dosing was initiated on day 2<br>
following implantation, and doses of mu-anti-KID24 and PBS control were<br>
administered 2 times weekly, for 3 weeks, as single rapid injections into the<br>
intraperitoneal cavity.<br>
(0207| At the end of the dosing period, animals were euthanized and the tumors<br>
and adjacent tissue were removed and incubated in a digestion buffer containing<br>
proteinase K (1.45 mg/ml) and RNAse A (0,07 mg/ml) overnight at 55°C for<br>
PCR analysis.<br>
[0208] To generate a template for PCR analysis, genomic DNA was isolated from<br>
tumors using Wizard SV Genomic Purification System (Promega) according to<br>
manufacturer's instructions. Each DNA sample was resuspended in a final<br>
volume of 200 ul.<br>
[0209J The amount of human DNA in the tumors^wasquantitated using real-<br>
time PCR on an Applied Biosystems SDS7000 system, with primers and probe<br>
specific forthe hitman ribosomal gene RPL19.<br>
(0210J Each sample was initially digested with BstXl to ensure efficient<br>
amplification. Each reaction mix contained 5 fxl of template DNA, 5 \d Taqman<br>
Gold lOx reaction buffer (Applied Biosystems), 5 units BstXl, 4mM MgCl,, 2.5<br>
mM each deoxynucleotide mix, 250 mM each primer, 150 nM probe, 1.5 units<br>
Taqgold (Applied Biosystems) and water to a final volume of 50 ul. The thermal<br>
cycle conditions used were 30 minutes at 45°C for BstXl digestion, 10 minutes at<br>
95°C for BstXl inactivation and Taq hot start, followed by 40 cycles of: 95°C for<br>
20 seconds (denaturation) and 60°C for 1 minute (elongation).<br>
[0211) A standard curve was generated using four-fold serial dilutions of human<br>
genomic DNA (BD Biosciences Clonetech) ranging from 400 to 0.09 ng<br>
DNA/reaction. Sample DNA concentrations were interpolated from the<br>
standard curve. Each tumor sample was analyzed in triplicate PCR reactions and<br>
average DNA concentrations were determined. From these experiments,<br>
Merkel cell tumors treated with mu-anti-KID24 at 50 mg/kg concentration<br>
showed a 50% decrease in the amount of human DNA when compared to<br>
control PBS treated tumors.<br><br>
[0212] Similar sub-renal capsule experiments were performed on established<br>
Merkel cell tumors. Merkel cells were treated as described above and tumors<br>
were implanted as described above. The tumors were allowed to grow for 21<br>
days before antibody administration. At 21 days post-tumor implantation, the<br>
mice were dosed with 50 mg/kg mu-anti-KID24 or PBS control twice weekly for<br>
3 weeks. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors<br>
removed. As shown in Figure 3, the tumors from the mu-anti-KID24 treated<br>
mice are significantly smaller than the tumors found in the PBS treated mice.<br>
Also significant was the number of metastasis found in mice treated with mu-<br>
anti-KID24 as compared to PBS treated mice. Metastases could be found in the<br>
omentum, diaphragm, spleen, ovary and lungs of the PBS treated mice. No<br>
metastases were found in mu-anti-KID24 treated mice. Figure 4A shows the<br>
omentum from a PBS treated mouse. The arrows/arrowheads point to<br>
metastases that can be. found on: the tissue. Figure 4B shows the omentum from<br>
a mu-anti-KID24 treated mouse.. No metastases can be seen (under a dissecting<br>
microscope) on the tissue.<br>
