				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of 3-Amino- 2-Aroyl acrylic acid derivatives. The 3-amino-2-aroyl acrylic acid derivatives prepared by the process of the present invention have the general formula -I, and are valuable intermediates for the synthesis of highly active antibacterial agents. 3-Amino-2-aroyl acrylic acid derivatives of the formula-I.<br><br>

are useful intermediates for the preparation of highly active antibacterial agents<br>
such as Sparfloxacin , Ciprofloxacin, Norfloxacin, Pefloxacin, Enrofloxacin and<br>
number of other related compounds of quinolone group.<br>
2<br><br>
Prior Art:<br>
a)	3-Amino-2-Aroyl acrylic acid derivatives of the formula-Ill were prepared by<br>
condensation of substituted benzoyl chloride of the formula-II with<br>
p-dimethyl amino acrylic acid derivatives of the formula (A) in the presence of<br>
an acid acceptors such as triethylamine (Canadian Patent by Bayer 1255678).<br><br>
The above said prior art process has the following disadvantages<br>
The starting material dimethyl amino acrylate of the formula (A) is very expensive. Hence to produce antibacterials at a cheaper price, it is necessary to produce the intermediates of the formula-Ill at a cheaper price.<br>
The supply of starting material of the formula (A) is controlled by few companies in the world . Hence to plan for the preparation of high volume of antibacterials is risky if we depend totally on imports.<br>
b)	The second process which is presently practised in India is as follows.<br><br>
The halogenated ketone of the formula-IV is reacted with sodium hydride (NaH) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to produce betaketo ester of the formula-V. This betaketoester of the formula (V) is reacted with acetic anhydride (AC2O) arid triethyl orthoformate (TEOF) to produce enol ether of the formula-VI. The compound of the formula-VI is reacted with the amine to give 3-amino-2-Aroyl acrylic acid derivatives of the formula-VII.<br><br>
In all the above said formulae X, X\, X2, X3, X4 represent hydrogen, halogen (preferably CI or F} and/or alkyl (C1-C3)<br>
R2 = methyl, ethyl, cyclopropyl, 2,4-Difluorophenyl and optional substituted aromatic radicals.<br>
The above said process has the following draw backs.<br>
The reaction of betaketoester (V) with acetic anhydride and triethyl orthoformate is a high temperature reaction (140-150°C) and the yields are very sensitive to moisture and can vary from 30-85%.<br><br>
Since    the    antibacterial	compounds    Spariloxacin,     Ciprofloxacin,<br>
Norfloxacin, Pefloxacin, and Enrofloxacin have become very useful drugs and there is a need for an economic and simple methodology for then commercial production overcoming the above problems.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved process for the preparation of 3-Amino-2-aroyl acrylic acid derivatives of the formula-1 as defined above by overcoming the draw backs of the hitherto known processes.<br>
The synthesis of most of the quinolone antibacterials go through the key derivative of acrylate of the formula-I. We have, due to our sustained research work, observed that the reaction between the anion of p-Keto ester (derived from Ketone of the formula-IV and dimethyl carbonate of the formula-VIII) with complex of the formula-IX provides an important basis for the development of the present invention.<br><br>
X   represents hydrogen, methyl, nitro or halogen preferably fluorine. Xi represents halogen preferably chlorine or fluorine X2 represents halogen preferably chlorine or fluorine X3 represents hydrogen or halogen , preferably fluorine and, X4 represents hydrogen or halogen, preferably fluorine Ri    has the meaning given earlier<br>
