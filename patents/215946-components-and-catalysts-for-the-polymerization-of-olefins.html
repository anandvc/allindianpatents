				<td>The present invention relates to catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins, to the catalyst obtained therefrom and to the use of said catalysts in the polymerization of olefins CH,=CHR in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms. In particular the present invention relates to catalyst components, suitable for the stereospecific polymerization of olefins, comprising Ti, Mg, halogen and an electron donor compound selected fi-om esters of substituted succinic acids (substituted succinates). Said catalyst components when used in the polymerization of olefins, and in particular of propylene, are capable to give polymers in high yields and with high isotactic index expressed in terms of high xylene insolubility. The chemical class of succinates is known in the art. However, the specific succinates of the present invention have never been used as internal electron donors in catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
EP-A-86473 mentions the use of unsubstituted succinates as internal donors in catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins. The use of diisobutyl succinate and di-n-butyl succinate is also exemphfied. The results obtained in terms of isotactic index and yields are however poor.<br>
The use of polycarboxylic acid esters, including succinates, as internal donors in catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins, is also generically disclosed in EP 125911. Diethyl methylsuccinate and diallyl ethylsuccinate are mentioned in the description although they are not exemphfied. Furthermore, EP263718 mentions, but does not exemplify the use of diethyl methylsuccinate and di-n-butyl ethylsuccinate as internal donors, hi order to check the performances of these succinates according to the teaching of the art the applicant has carried out some polymerization tests employing catalyst components containing diethyl methylsuccinate and diisobutyl ethylsuccinate, respectively, as internal donors. As shown in the experimental section, both the so obtained catalysts gave an unsatisfactory activity/stereospecificity balance very similar to that obtained with catalysts containing unsubstituted succinates. It has been therefore very surprising to discover that the specific substitution in the succinates of the invention generates compounds that, when used as internal donors, give catalyst components having excellent activity and stereospecificity. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a solid catalyst component for the<br><br>
polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising Mg, Ti, halogen and an electron donor selected from succinates of formula (I):<br><br>
wherein the radicals R1, and R2, equal to, or different from, each other are a C1-C20 linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms; the radicals R3 to R6 equal to, or different from, each other, are hydrogen or a 0,-0,0 linear or branched alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms, and the radicals R3 to R6 which are joined to the same carbon atom can be linked together to form a cycle; with the proviso that when R3 to R5 are contemporaneously hydrogen R6 is a radical selected from primary branched, secondary or tertiary alkyl groups, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl groups having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.

It is easily derivable for the ones skilled in the art that all the above mentioned compounds can be used either in form of pure stereoisomers or in the form of mixtures of enantiomers, or mixture of diastereoisomers and enantiomers. When a pure isomer is to be used it is normally isolated using the common techniques known in the art. In particular some of the succinates of the present invention can be used as a pure rac or meso forms, or as mixtures thereof, respectively.<br>
As explained above, the catalyst components of the invention comprise, in addition to the above electron donors, Ti, Mg and halogen. In particular, the catalyst components comprise a titanium compoimd, having at least a Ti-halogen bond and the above mentioned electron donor compound supported on a Mg halide. The magnesium halide is preferably MgClj in active form which is widely known from the patent literature as a support for Ziegler-Natta catalysts. Patents USP 4,298,718 and USP 4,495,338 were the first to describe the use of these compounds in Ziegler-Natta catalysis. It is known from these patents that the magnesium dihalides in active form used as support or co-support in components of catalysts for the polymerization of olefins are characterized by X-ray spectra in which the most intense diffraction line that appears in the spectrum of the non-active halide is diminished in intensity and is broadened to form a halo. The preferred titanium compoimds used in the catalyst component of the present invention are TiCl4 and TiClj; furthermore, also Ti-haloalcoholates of formula Ti(OR)n.yXy, where n is the valence of titanium, X is halogen and y is a number between 1 and n, can be used. The preparation of the solid catalyst component can be carried out according to several methods. According to one of these methods, the magnesium dichloride in an anhydrous state and the succinate of formula (I) are milled together under conditions in which activation of the magnesium dichloride occurs. The so obtained product can be treated one or more times with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature between 80 and 135 °C. This treatment is followed by washings with hydrocffl-bon solvents until chloride ions disappeared. According to a further method, the product obtained by co-milling the magnesium chloride in an anhydrous state, the titanium compound and the P-substituted succinate is treated with halogenated hydrocarbons such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, etc. The treatment is carried out for a time<br><br>
between 1 and 4 hours and at temperature of from 40 °C to the boiling point of the halogenated hydrocarbon. The product obtained is then generally washed with inert hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane.<br>
According to another method, magnesium dichloride is preactivated according to well known methods and then treated with an excess of TiCl4 at a temperature of about 80 to 135 °C which contains, in solution, a succinate of formula (I). The treatment with TiCl4 is repeated and the solid is washed with hexane in order to eliminate any non-reacted TiCl4.<br>
A further method comprises the reaction between magnesium alcoholates or chloroalcoholates (in particular chloroalcoholates prepared according to U.S. 4,220,554) and an excess of TiCl4 comprising the succinate of formula (I) in solution at a temperature of about 80 to 120 °C. According to a preferred method, the solid catalyst component can be prepared by reacting a titanium compound of formula Ti(OR)„.yXy, where n is the valence of titanium and y is a number between 1 and n, preferably TiCl4, with a magnesium chloride deriving from.an adduct of formula MgCljpROH, where p is a number between 0.1 and 6, preferably from 2 to 3.5, and R is a hydrocarbon radical having 1-18 carbon atoms. The adduct can be suitably prepared in spherical form by mixing alcohol and magnesium chloride in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon immiscible with the adduct, operating under stirring conditions at the melting temperature of the adduct (100-130 °C). Then, the emulsion is quickly quenched, thereby causing the solidification of the adduct in form of spherical particles. Examples of spherical adducts prepared according to this procedure are described m USP 4,399,054 and USP 4,469,648. The so obtained adduct can be directly reacted with the Ti compound or it can be previously subjected to thermally controlled dealcoholation (80-130 °C) so as to obtain an adduct in which the number of moles of alcohol is generally lower than 3 preferably between 0.1 and 2.5. The reaction with the Ti compound can be carried out by suspending the adduct (dealcoholated or as such) in cold TiCl4 (generally 0 °C); the mixture is heated up to 80-130 °C and kept at this temperature for 0.5-2 hours. The treatment with TiCl4 can be carried out one or more times. The succinate of formula (I) can be added during the treatment with TiCl4. The treatment with the electron donor compound can be repeated one or more times.<br>
The preparation of catalyst components in spherical form is described for example in European Patent Applications EP-A-395083, EP-A-553805, EP-A-553806, EPA-601525 and WO98/44009.<br><br>
The solid catalyst components obtained according to the above method show a surface area (by B.E.T. method) generally between 20 and 500 m"/g and preferably between 50 and 400 mVg, and a total porosity (by B.E.T. method) higher than 0.2 cmVg preferably between 0.2 and 0.6 cmVg. The porosity (Hg method) due to pores with radius up to 10000 A generally ranges from 0.3 to 1.5 cmVg, preferably from 0.45 to 1 cmVg.<br>
A further method to prepare the solid catalyst component of the invention comprises halogenating magnesium dihydrocarbyloxide compounds, such as magnesium dialkoxide or diaryloxide, with solution of TiCl4 in aromatic hydrocarbon (such as toluene, xylene, etc.) at temperatures between 80 and 130 °C. The treatment with TiCl4 in aromatic hydrocarbon solution can be repeated one or more times, and the P-substituted succinate is added during one or more of these treatments. In any of these preparation methods the desired succinate of formula (I) can be added as such or, in an altemative way, it can be obtained in situ by using an appropriate precursor capable to be transformed in the desired electron donor compound by means, for example, of known chemical reactions such as esterification, transesterification, etc. Generally, the succinate of formula (I) is used in molar ratio with respect to the MgCl2 of from 0.01 to 1 preferably from 0.05 to 0.5. Moreover, and this constitutes another object of the present invention, it has been found that interesting results are obtained when others internal electron donor compounds are used together with the succinates of formula (I). The additional electron donor compound can be the same as the electron donor (d) disclosed below. In particular very good results have been obtained when the 1,3-diethers of formula (11) below are used as internal donors together with a succinate of formula<br>
(I)-<br>
The solid catalyst components according to the present invention are converted into catalysts for<br>
the polymerization of olefins by reacting them with organoaluminum compounds according to<br>
known methods.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins<br>
CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising<br>
the product of the reaction between:<br>
(a)	a solid catalyst component comprising a Mg, Ti and halogen and an electron donor selected from succinates of formula (I);<br>
(b)	an alkylaluminum compound and, optionally.<br><br>
(c)  one or more electron donor compounds (extemal donor).<br>
The alkylaluminum compound (b) is preferably selected from the trialkyl aluminum compounds such as for example triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum. It is also possible to use mixtures of trialkylaluminum"s with alkylaluminum halides, alkylaluminum hydrides or alkylaluminum sesquichlorides such as AlEtjCl and AlzEtjClj. Also alkylalumoxanes can be used.<br>
It is a particular interesting aspect of the invention the fact that the above described catalysts are able to give polymers with high isotactic index even when the polymerization is carried out in the absence of an extemal donor (c). In particular, operating for example according to the working examples described below propylene polymers having an isotactic index around 96% are obtained without using an extemal donor compound. These kind of products are very interesting for applications in which the crystallinity of the polymer should not be at its maximum level. This particular behavior is very surprising in view of the fact that the esters of dicarboxylic acids known in the art, when used as internal donors, give polymers with a poor isotactic index when the polymerization is carried out in the absence of an extemal electron donor compound. For applications in which a very high isotactic index is required the use of an extemal donor compoimd is normally advisable. The extemal donor (c) can be of the same type or it can be different from the succinate of formula (I). Preferred external electron donor compounds include silicon compounds,  ethers,  esters,  such  as  ethyl 4-ethoxybenzoate,  amines,  heterocyclic compounds and particularly 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, ketones and the 1,3-diethers of the general formula (II): <br>
wherein RI, RII, RIII, RIV, RV and RVI" are equal or different to each other, are hydrogen or hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and RVII and RVIII, equal or different from each other, have the same meaning of R"-RVI" except that they cannot be hydrogen; one or more of the R1-RVIII groups can be linked to fomi a cycle. Particularly preferred are the 1,3-diethers in<br><br>
which RVII and RVIII are selected from C1 C4 alkyl radicals, RIIIand RIVform a condensed unsaturated cycle and RI", RII RV and RVI" are hydrogen. The use of 9,9-bis(methoxymethyl)fluorene is particularly preferred.<br>
Another class of preferred external donor compounds is that of silicon compounds of formula<br>
Ra"Rb^Si(OR^c, where a and b are integer from 0 to 2, c is an integer from 1 to 3 and the sum<br>
(a+b+c) is 4; R7 R8 and R9, are CI-CI 8 hydrocarbon groups optionally containing heteroatoms.<br>
Particularly preferred are the silicon compounds in which a is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R7<br>
and R* is selected from branched alkyl, alkenyl, alkylene, cycloalkyl or aryl groups with 3-10<br>
carbon atoms optionally containing heteroatoms and R"9is a C,-C,o alkyl group, in particular<br>
methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane,<br>
diphenyldimethoxysilane, methyl-t-butyldimethoxysilane, dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane, 2-<br>
ethylpiperidinyl-2-t-butyldimethoxysilane	and	(1,1,1 -trifluoro-2-propyl)-2-<br>
ethylpiperidinyldimethoxysilane and (1,1,1 -trifluoro-2-propyl)-methyldimethoxysilane. Moreover, are also preferred the silicon compounds in which a is 0, c is 3, R" is a branched alkyl or cycloalkyl group, optionally containing heteroatoms, and R" is methyl. Examples of such preferred silicon compounds are cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane, t-butyltrimethoxysilane and thexyltrimethoxysilane.<br>
The electron donor compound (c) is used in such an amount to give a molar ratio between the organoaluminum compound and said electron donor compound (c) of from 0.1 to 500, preferably from 1 to 300 and more preferably from 3 to 100. As previously indicated, when used in the (co)polymerization of olefins, and in particular of propylene, the catalysts of the invention allow to obtain, with high yields, polymers having a high isotactic index (expressed by high xylene insolubility X.I.), thus showing an excellent balance of properties. This is particularly surprising in view of the fact that, as it can be seen from the comparative examples here below reported, the use as internal electron donors of a-substituted or unsubstituted succinate compounds gives worse results in term of yields and/or xylene insolubility.<br>
As mentioned above, the succinates of formula (I) can be used also as external donors with good results. In particular, it has been found that they are able to give very good results even when they are used as external electron donor compounds in combination with catalyst components containing an internal donor different from the succinates of formula (I). This is very surprising<br><br>
because the esters of dicarboxylic acids known in the art are normally not able to give satisfactory results when used as external donors. On the contrary, the succinates of the formula (I) are able to give polymers still having a good balance between isotactic index and yields. It is therefore another object of the present invention a catalyst system for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising the product of the reaction between:<br>
(i)       a sohd catalyst component comprising a Mg, Ti and halogen and an electron donor (d); (ii)      an alkylaluminum compound and, (iii)     a succinate of formula (I).<br>
The alminum alkyl compound (ii) has the same meanings of the aluminum compound (b) given above. The electron donor compound (d) can be selected from ethers, esters of organic mono or bicarboxylic acids, such as phthalates, benzoates, glutarates, succinates having a different structure from those of formula (I), amines. Preferably, it is selected from 1,3-propanediethers of formula (II) and esters of organic mono or bicarboxyUc acids in particular phthalates. As mentioned above all these catalysts can be used in the processes for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms. The preferred a-olefins to be (co)polymerized are ethene, propene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In particular, the above-described catalysts have been used in the (co)polymerization of propene and ethylene to prepare different kinds of products. For example the following products can be prepared: high density ethylene polymers (HDPE, having a density higher than 0.940 g/cm"), comprising ethylene homopolymers and copolymers of ethylene with a-olefins having 3-12 carbon atoms; linear low density polyethylenes (LLDPE, having a density lower than 0.940 g/cm3) and very low density and ultra low density (VLDPE and ULDPE, having a density lower than 0.920 g/cm\ to 0.880 g/cm3) consisting of copolymers of ethylene with one or more a-olefins having fi-om 3 to 12 carbon atoms, having a mole content of vmits derived fi-om the ethylene higher than 80%; elastomeric copolymers of ethylene and propylene and elastomeric terpolymers of ethylene and propylene with smaller proportions of a diene having a content by weight of units derived fi-om the ethylene comprised between about 30 and 70%, isotactic polypropylenes and crystalline copolymers of propylene and ethylene and/or other a-olefins having a content of units derived fi"om propylene higher than 85% by weight (random<br><br>
copolymers); shock resistant polymers of propylene obtained by sequential polymerization of propylene and mixtures of propylene with ethylene, containing up to 30% by weight of ethylene; copolymers of propylene and 1-butene having a number of units derived from 1-butene comprised between 10 and 40% by weight. Particularly interesting are the propylene polymers obtainable with the catalyst of the invention showing broad MWD coupled with high isotactic index and<br>
high modulus. In fact, said polymers having a polydispersity index of higher than 5, a content of<br>
f isotactic units expressed in terms of pentads of higher than 97% and a flexural modulus of at least<br>
2000 MPa. Preferably, the polydispersity index is higher than 5.1, the flexural modulus is higher than 2100 and the percent of propylene units in form of pentads is higher than 97.5%. Any kind of polymerization process can be used with the catalysts of the invention that are very versatile. The polymerization can be carried out for example in slurry using as diluent an inert hydrocarbon solvent, or in bulk using the liquid monomer (for example propylene) as a reaction medium. Moreover, it is possible to carry out the polymerization process in gas-phase operating in one or more fluidized or mechanically agitated bed reactors.<br>
The catalyst of the present invention can be ixsed as such in the polymerization process by introducing it directly into the reactor. In the alternative, the catalyst can be pre-polymerized before being introduced into the first polymerization reactor. The term pre-polymerized, as used in the art, means a catalyst which has been subject to a polymerization step at a low conversion degree. According to the present invention a catalyst is considered to be pre-polymerized when the amount the polymer produced is from about 0.1 up to about 1000 g per gram of soHd catalyst component.<br>
The pre-polymerization can be carried out with the a-olefins selected from the same group of olefins disclosed before. In particular, it is especially preferred pre-polymerizing ethylene or mixtures thereof with one or more a-olefins in an amount up to 20% by mole. Preferably, the conversion of the pre-polymerized catalyst component is from about 0.2 g up to about 500 g per gram of solid catalyst component.<br>
The pre-polymerization step can be carried out at temperatures from 0 to 80 °C preferably from 5 to 50 °C in liquid or gas-phase. The pre-polymerization step can be performed in-line as a part of a continuous polymerization process or separately in a batch process. The batch pre-polymerization of the catalyst of the invention with ethylene in order to produce an amount of<br><br>
polymer ranging from 0.5 to 20 g per gram of catalyst component is particularly preferred.<br>
The polymerization is generally carried out at temperature of from 20 to 120 °C, preferably of<br>
from 40 to 80 °C. When the polymerization is carried out in gas-phase the operating pressure is<br>
generally between 0.5 and 10 MPa, preferably between 1 and 5 MPa. In the bulk polymerization<br>
the operating pressure is generally between 1 and 6 MPa preferably between 1.5 and 4 MPa.<br>
Hydrogen or other compounds capable to act as chain transfer agents can be used to control the<br>
molecular weight of polymer.<br>
The following examples are given in order to better illustrate the invention without limiting it.<br>

Polymerization<br>
Propylene polymerization: general procedure<br>
In a 4 liter autoclave, purged with nitrogen flow at 70 °C for one our, 75 mL of anhydrous hexane containing 800 mg of AlEt3, 79,8 mg of dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane and 10 mg of solid catalyst component were introduced in propylene flow at 30 °C. The autoclave was closed. 1.5 ML of hydrogen were added and then, under stirring, 1.2 kg of liquid propene were fed. The temperature was raised to 70 °C"in five minutes and the polymerization was carried out at this temperature for two hours. The nonreacted propylene was removed, the polymer was collected, dried at 70 °C under vacuum for three hours, weighed, and fi-actionated with o-xylene to determine the amount of the xylene insoluble (X.I.) fi-action at 25 C. Ethylene/1-butene polymerization: general procedure<br>
A 4.0 Hter stainless-steel autoclave equipped with a magnetic stirrer, temperature, pressure indicator, feeding line for ethene, propane, 1-butene, hydrogen, and a steel vial for the injection of the catalyst, was purified by fluxing pure nitrogen at 70 °C for 60 minutes. It was then washed with propane, heated to 75 °C and finally loaded with 800 g of propane, 1-butene (as reported in Table 4), ethene (7.0 bar, partial pressure) and hydrogen (2.0 bar, partial pressure).<br>
In a 100 mL three neck glass flask were introduced in the following order, 50 mL of anhydrous hexane, 9.6 mL of 10 % by wt/vol, TEAL/hexane solution, optionally an external donor (E.D., as reported in Table 4) and the solid catalyst. They were mixed together and stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes and then introduced in the reactor through the steel vial by using a nitrogen overpressure.<br>
Under continuous stirring, the total pressure was rm intained constant at 75 °C for 120 minutes by feeding ethene. At the end the reactor was depn ssurised and the temperature was dropped to 30 °C. The collected polymer was dried at 70 °C inder a nitrogen flow and weighted. Determination of xylene insolubles (X.I.)<br>
2.5 g of polymer were dissolved in 250 mL of o-xyl sne under stirring at 135 °C for 30 minutes, then the solution was cooled to 25 °C and after 30 minutes the insoluble polymer was filtered. The resulting solution was evaporated in nitrogen flo w and the residue was dried and weighed to determine the percentage of soluble polymer and the  by difference the xylene insoluble fraction<br><br>
Determination of comonomer content in the copolymer:<br>
1-Butylene was determined via infrared spectrometry.<br>
Thermal analysis:<br>
Calorimetric measurements were performed by using a differential scanning calorimeter DSC<br>
Mettler. The instrument is calibrated with indium and tin standards. The weighted sample (5-10<br>
mg), obtained from the melt index determination, was sealed into aluminum pans, heated to 200<br>
°C and kept at that temperature for a time long enough (5 minutes) to allow a complete melting<br>
of all the crystallites. Successively, after cooling at 20 °C/min to -20 °C, the peak temperature<br>
was assumed as crystallization temperature (Tc). After standing 5 minutes at 0 °C, the sample<br>
was heated to 200 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. In this second heating run, the peak temperature was<br>
assumed as melting temperature (Tm) and the area as the global melting enthalpy (AH).<br>
Determination of melt index (M.I.):<br>
Melt index was measured at 190 °C following ASTM D-1238 over a load of:<br>
2.16kg,MIE = MI2.16.<br>
21.6kg,MIF = MI21.6. The ratio: F/E = MI F/MIE = MI21.6/MI2.16 is then defined as melt flow ratio (MFR) Determination of density:<br>
Density was determined on the homogenized polymers (from the M.I. determination) by using a gradient column and following the ASTM D-1505 procedure. Determination of polydispersity index (P.I.)<br>
This property is strictly connected with the molecular weight distribution of the polymer xrnder examination. In particular it is inversely proportional to the creep resistance of the polymer in the molten state. Said resistance called modulus separation at low modulus value (500 Pa), was determined at a temperature of 200 °C by using a parallel plates rheometer model RMS-800 marketed by RHEOMETRICS (USA), operating at an oscillation frequency which increases from 0.1 rad/sec to 100 rad/sec. From the modulus separation value, one can derive the P.I. by way of the equation:<br>
P.I.= 54.6*(moduIus separation)176 in which the modulus separation is defined as:<br><br>
modulus separation = frequency at G"=500Pa / frequency at G"=500Pa wherein G" is storage modulus and G" is the loss modulus.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a solid catalyst component for the polymerization of olefins CH2=CHR, in which R is hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl radical with 1-12 carbon atoms, comprising Mg, Ti, halogen and an electron donor selected from succinates of formula (1):<br><br>
wherein the radicals R1 and R2, equal to or different from each other, are a C1-C20 linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms; the radicals R3 to R6 equal to or different from each other, are hydrogen or a C1-C20 linear or branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aryl alkyl or alkylaryl group, optionally containing heteroatoms, and the radicals R3 to R6 which are joined to the same carbon atom can be linked together to form a cycle; with the proviso that when R3 to R5 are contemporaneously hydrogen R6 is a radical selected from primary branched, secondary or tertiary alkyl groups, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkylaryl groups having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>

minutes and introduced in the empty reactor in propane flow. The autoclave was closed and<br>
800 g of propane were introduced, then the temperature was raised to 75 °C and ethylene (7.0<br>
bar, partial pressure) and hydrogen (3.0 bar, partial pressure) were added.<br>
Under continuous stirring, the total pressure was maintained at 75 °C for 180 minutes by<br>
feeding ethene. At the end the reactor was depressurised and the temperature was dropped to<br>
30 °C. The collected polymer was dried at 70 °C under a nitrogen flow.<br>
375 g of polyethylene were collected. The polymer characteristics are reported in Table 5.<br>
Example 44<br>
The solid catalyst of the example 43 was used in the ethylene/1-butene copolymerization as<br>
reported in the general procedure but without using any external donor.<br><br>
The other polymerization conditions are reported in Table 4 while the polymer characteristics<br>
are collected in Table 5.<br>
Example 45<br>
The solid catalyst of the example 43 was used in the ethylene/1-butene copolymerization as<br>
reported      in      the      general      procedure      but      by      using      0.56      mmol      of<br>
cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane as external donor.<br>
The other polymerization conditions are reported in Table 4 while the polymer characteristics<br>
are collected in Table 5.<br>
Example 46<br>
The solid catalyst of the example 43 was used in the ethylene/1-butene copolymerization as<br>
reported in the general procedure but by using 0.56 mmol of diethyl 2,3-diisopropylsuccinate<br>
as external donor.<br>
The other polymerization conditions are reported in Table 4 while the polymer characteristics<br>
are collected in Table 5.<br>
Example 47<br>
The solid catalyst of the example 43 was used in the ethylene/1-butene copolymerization in a<br>
fluidized gas-phase reactor as described below.<br>
A 15.0 liter stainless-steel fluidized reactor equipped with gas-circulation system, cyclone<br>
separator, thermal exchanger, temperature and pressure indicator, feeding line for ethylene,<br>
propane, 1-butene, hydrogen, and a 1 L steel reactor for the catalyst prepolymerization and<br>
injection of the prepolymer. The gas-phase apparatus was purified by fluxing pure nitrogen at<br>
40 °C for 12 hours and then was circulated a propane (10 bar, partial pressure) mixture<br>
containing 1.5 g of TEAL at 80 °C for 30 minutes. It was then depressurized and the reactor<br>
washed with pure propane, heated to 75 °C and finally loaded with propane (2 bar partial<br>
pressure), 1-butene (as reported in Table 4), ethylene (7.1 bar, partial pressure) and hydrogen<br>
(2.1 bar, partial pressure).<br>
In a 100 mL three neck glass flask were introduced in the following order, 20 mL of<br>
anhydrous hexane, 9.6 mL of 10 % by wt/vol, TEAL/hexane solution and the solid catalyst of<br>
the example 43 (in the amount reported in Table 4). They were mixed together and stirred at<br>
room temperature for 5 minutes and then introduced in the prepolymerization reactor<br><br>
maintained in a propane flow.<br>
The autoclave was closed and 80 g of propane and 90 g of propene were introduced at 40 °C. The mixture was allowed stirring at 40 °C for 30 minutes. The autoclave was then depressurized to eliminate the excess of unreacted propene, and the obtained prepolymer was injected into the gas-phase reactor by using a propane overpressure (1 bar increase in the gas-phase reactor). The final pressure, in the fluidized reactor, was maintained constant at 75 °C for 180 minutes by feeding a 10 wt.% 1-butene/ethene mixture.<br>
At the end, the reactor was depressurised and the temperature was dropped to 30 °C. The collected polymer was dried at 70 °C under a nitrogen flow and weighted. The polymer characteristics are collected in Table 5. Example 48<br>
Preparation of solid catalyst component<br>
The procedure of example 43 was repeated but instead of diethyl 2,3-diisopropylsuccinate was<br>
used diisobutyl phthalate (11.8 mmol). The characteristics of the dried catalyst were as follow:<br>
Ti	2.3 wt.%<br>
diisobutyl phthalate	4.4 wt.%<br>
Solvent	5.5 wt.%<br>
The solid catalyst was then used in the ethylene/1-butene copolymerization as reported in the general procedure but using diethyl 2,3-diisopropylsuccinate as E.D.<br>
The other polymerization conditions are reported in Table 4 while the polymer characteristics are collected in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
