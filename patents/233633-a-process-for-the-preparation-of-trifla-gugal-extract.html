				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF TRIFLA-GUGAL EXTRACT Tile of  the Invention<br>
The present invention describes the herbal formulation useful for antibacterial agent, anticeptic, and wound healing.The process and purification of Trifla- Gugal extract disclosed can be used for oral medicine for the remedy from severe bacterial infection of wounds and injuries. The preparation can be used locally and orally.<br>
Background of toe Invention<br>
During early Vedic period healing was thought to be the duty of priests and diseases were seen as the results of God's wrath for sins committed or blessings possessed by the demons or evil spirits.<br>
At the same time there was advancement in our Indian culture in the direction of healing science. The diseases were considered to be the effect of negative thoughts of the person. And for the healing purpose meditation and prayers were considered to be the best remedy.<br>
Afterwards "Medical knowledge as a Science"- in the form of Ayurvedic science was developed.<br>
-Punarvasu Atrey (about 6* century B.C) taught medicine at Takshashila.<br>
-His disciples wrote commentaries on Jatukarma, Harita, Ksharpani<br>
-Parasara wrote treatises on medicine.<br>
-Atrey himself. Patanjali (about 2nd century B.C) and later many others wrote commentaries on main Indian<br>
treatise on medicine, the Charka Sanhita<br>
-A very little part of these grand books are used now a day.<br>
Of course it is a fact that modem achievements in medical science, computer and electronics engineering has made human life very healthy and free from diseases but it is also true that some diseases cannot be cured permanently by Allopathic. For such diseases people has to look for Ayurved. Not only in India but different<br><br><br>
countries of the world are now very keenly interested in Ayurved. Perhaps it is better to say that the countries excluding India are more interested in biochemical reactions occurring in the human body by the use of ayurvedic medicines. Fascinating research works are carried in different countries for the knowledge of constituents of plants, production of ayurvedic medicines.<br>
References may also be made to Taxonomy of vascular plants(Laurence ),Systemic Botany(Dr.Sutaria), College Botany(Das, Dutta and Ganguli), Divyaushadhi Darshan with coloured pictures(Shobhan Vasani)<br>
It becomes the main duty of every Indian to work in this field to save and flourish our heritage. Every Indian must take interest in this field and it is also essential to train the growing children for this challenge.<br>
Detail description of Invention:<br>
GENERAL CHARACTERS OF THEPLANT: English name-Indian Bdellium Latin name-Balsamodendron mukul HK. (Old name) Commiohora wighti (Arn) (New name)<br>
This plant is found in deciduous forests of Gujarat. Near Palanpur in sandy hills it is found in abundance. There are two species viz. (1) baswillia and (2) guruga.<br>
It is a dicotyledonous plant Bursaraceae family. The plant is 1 to 3 meters in height and zigzag fashioned. The branches are pointed. The bark produces blue coloured chips, which are used as medicines. Leaves are short, small and simple. Leaf-fall occurs in winter. Flowers are small and red .Fruit is small, round and having three ridges.<br>
The trunk and branches secretes sticky fluid. This fluid is collected  and dried, which is known as<br><br>
Bdellium ( Gugal). It is colourless, transparent and pure, but after addition of impurities it becomes black. It possesses very peculiar smell and taste. In Kutchh this plant was cultivated in abundance, but due to earthquake a great damage occurred. There is a difference in natural grown Gugal and cultivated one. It shows tremendous difference in physical and chemical properties, so if it going to be used as medicine then it better to select the naturally grown Gugal.<br>
The fiime of Gugal purifies air but if the fume affects face and mouth, it causes dangerous effects. Over watering to this plant reduces the qualities of Gugal.<br>
Some substances are interwoven in the life, religion and heritage of Indian culture. Indian Bdellium or Gugal is one of them. Today tea is the drink which is used in almost all the houses of India. In the same way, Gugal was used before some years.<br>
At the time of Morning Prayer, in the afternoon at the time of lunch and in the evening Gugal was used especially it's fume, which is also called "DHUP".<br>
Monsoon is a blessing for all living organisms but at the same time it is the mother of many diseases pertaining to digestion, respiration, excretion and nervous functioning. In monsoon when sunlight is very rare, the process of digestion becomes slow and due to that loss of apatite occurs. This causes gas troubles and nervous diseases. New water, new cereals, new grass, new vegetables and changed air causes decay, bad smell, impurities and moisture.<br>
Today Gugal is not very popular in every house because it is very cheap and easily available. People always go for popular brand names and imported items. -This substance, though it is very essential not accepted by people in our country. But at the same time science has studied and understood the importance of Gugal. The science known as Allopathic which is based on the activities of microbes, also suggests that "The fume of Gugal has a unique nature of destroying the disease causing microbes.<br>
Gugal is used in gas troubles, wounds, contagious diseases, mental diseases, cough, skin diseases, kidney<br><br>
disorders, syphilis, fractures and other bone diseases, cancer, leucorrhea, infertility, pregnancy, tuberculosis and other diseases. Fume of Gugal and it's qualities as medicine is a great blessing for mankind.<br>
Direct Gugal is used for different diseases or it is mixed with other substances and used as medicine. Some of them are as follows.<br>
-Gugal is mixed in the kwath of Turmeric (Daruhaldi) which helps in diabetes, -Gugal is mked in Neem kwath which cures leucoderma -Gugal mixed with Tinospora which cures blood diseases. -Gugal mixed with the cow urine (gomutra) cures anemia.<br>
In market Gugal is found in natural form, artificial synthetic form. Many ayurvedic pharmacies have prepared powders, tablets and other forms of Gugal, but pure and natural form of Gugal is more effective as medicine.<br>
It is said in Ayurved that if lungs cannot get proper amount of fresh air, many diseases occur. But if the best smell of Gugal spreads in the entire human body, there is not any scope for such disease. That is why, Gugal is the best medicine for tuberculosis.<br>
Many types of Gugal are formed from the pure Gugal. Some of them are as follows-<br>
1 -Yograj Gugal	6-Trilala Gugal	11 -Vishvadya Gugal<br>
2-Mahayograj Gugal	7-Sinhnad gugal	12-Trayodashng Gugal<br>
3-Kaishor Gugal	8-Vatari Gugal	13-Abhadi Gugal<br>
4-ShadangGugai	9-Lakshadii Gugal	14-Vidangudi Gugal<br>
5-Aniruta Gugal	10-Rasnadi Gugal	15-Pathyadi gugal<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an herbal formulation for the preparation of<br>
trifla- gugal extract useful as antibacterial agent, antiseptic and wound healing comprising<br>
Trifla and gugal.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the Trifla and Gugal is in a combination of equal<br>
quantity of formulation i.e 1:1.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the Trifla is a mixture of of Emblica<br>
officinalis, Terminalia chebula and Terminalia belerica in equal proportion.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the gugul, a dry plant secretion is obtained<br>
from Balasamodendoon mukul.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>

g.) removing the above said cloth and boiling the filtrate obtained in step (f) to obtain<br>
trifla-gugal extract.<br>
CASE STUDIES:<br>
Trifala Gugal is used as a medicine on many diseases. Out of these it is used by me as antiseptic and antibiotic to stop pus formation and healing of wounds. This medicine is used on many patients and on animals too. I am very happy to tell that in all the cases I got very positive results. Out of many cases I would like to describe three. The case study of them is as follows.<br>
(1)  Prof. Dilipkumar A. Shukla<br>
Lecturer in Dept. of Biology (Zoology)<br>
Navjivan Science College,<br>
Dahod.<br>
He was very badly injured. His first fingure of right hand was<br>
and doctor suggested that his fingure must be amputed. His first phalanx was amputed. He was given very costly antibiotics. After some time pus formation started, His second phalanx was amputed. This time also he was given high dose of very costly antibiotics. Again pus started. When he was keeping his fingure downward pus was drooping from the fingure. Doctors suggested that his pus has infected the whole palm so to save the entire hand it is better to amputee the palm. He was very scared and disheartened. We can imagine a man with out right palm ! How horrible it seems !<br>
Then he started Trifala Gugal, three tablets 4 times a day. He coatrolted his diet too. He stopped oily food, milk, sugar, rice and sweets. He was astonished to see mat pus formation stopped with in a week. Doctors were also surprised to see the miracle of Trifala Gugal. His hand was saved by this medicine.<br>
(2)    Mrs. Indumatiben Verma. "Gurukrupa"-, society Godi road, Dahod.<br>
This lady was a diabetic patient. She was operated for bypass surgery in April-2002, in Sterling Hospital, Ahmedabad. The operation was successful and she was out of danger. After one month pus formation started in left leg and sternum region. Any antibiotic was not working. Then Trifala Gugal was started and with in 5 days. She also controlled her diet as shown above. She was taking 3 tablets of Trifala Gugal three times a day.<br>
( 3 ) Tommy-A Pat dog.<br>
Tommy is a very clever and obedient dog. It was having wounds on the neck and h had started decaying. It was sure for it to die within a short time. Trifala Gugal powder mixed in roti and milk was given to it. Dry powder of Trifala Gugal was applied on the wound and with in 5 days the wound was cured and decay stopped. Now it is free from danger.<br>
After observing the positive results of Trifala Gugal, I thought to carry out some experiments in laboratory. I thought to perform experiment on bacteria For this I applied the following method.<br>
METHOD:<br>
•	I prepared Trifala Gugal solution by dissolving 10 gms. Powder in 100 ml water.<br>
•	I took two Petri dishes and spreaded Agar-Agar nutritive medium.<br>
I spread bacteria on each petridish.<br>
•   One petridish was kept as control and another was applied 5 ml of Trifala Gugal<br>
daily.<br>
OBSERVATIONS:<br>
After one week in the control petridish some bacterial colonies were observed \^e in arxjthsrlhaevvas no bactoidroloiy.<br>
After second v^tee were plenty ofbacterialcok^^	<br>
After tod week Ihe whole petridish was covered by bacteria in control petridish while in the another tee was no bacterial colony.<br>
As we know that series of antibiotic drugs are a\dlable in the maricetM patier^ but some times te« pills or injecticrab^<br>
the bacteria arises to findout "he specific antibiotic to IdUte specific kind of bacteria. Even in cases after a prolong treatment of antfootics,wecannQtstopthepiBformatim of that particular organ of the body.<br>
This is what we have achieved in allopathic practice!<br>
So looking to the other side of the coin, tee is a marvelous remedy in our ayurvedic practice. TrifekGugal is one of them. In case of any external or internal infection, if the patient is given tablets of Triiala Gugal along with proper diet control, hundred percent successes can be achieved<br><br>
Advantages of this formulation<br>
It is very cheap medidne.<br>
It is easily available in any part of die courtry.<br>
It has no side effects.<br>
It has no inflating taste and smell.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A process for the preparation of Trifla-gugal extract, comprising of:<br>
a.) characterized   in   that   taking   trifla   wherein   Trifla   is   a   mixture   of   Emblica<br>
