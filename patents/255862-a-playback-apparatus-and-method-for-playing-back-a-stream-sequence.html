Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention belongs to a technical field of<br>
Virtual Packages.<br>
Background Art<br>
A Virtual Package is a technique of constructing a virtual package by dynamically combining a digital stream<br>
recorded on a read-only recording medium such as a BD-ROM<br>
and a digital stream recorded on a rewritable recording medium<br>
such as a hard disk, in order to develop the contents of the<br>
read-only recording medium. Suppose the digital stream<br>
recorded on the BD-ROM constitutes a movie work and the digital<br>
stream recorded on the hard disk constitutes a sequel to the<br>
movie work. This being the case, by constructing the above<br>
Virtual Package, the movie work recorded on the BD-ROM and<br>
the sequel recorded on the hard disk can be treated as one<br>
long feature film and submitted for playback.<br>
For example, the following patent document describes<br>
a conventional technique about Virtual Packages.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2002-369154<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems the Invention is going to Solve<br><br>
However, when playing back the digital stream recorded<br>
on the BD-ROM and the digital stream recorded on the hard<br>
disk as one stream sequence, there may be a case where an<br>
unstable digital stream is contained in the stream sequence.<br>
The unstable digital stream referred to here is such a digital<br>
stream that has not yet been downloaded to the hard disk or<br>
that is incompletely written to the hard disk. When playing<br>
back the stream sequence despite the existence of such an<br>
unstable digital stream, the playback may become unstable<br>
or halt once a point of playback by playback means has reached<br>
the unstable digital stream.<br><br>
If playback means (such as a decoder) in a playback<br>
apparatus is capable of checking whether a stream to be played<br>
back is unstable or not, the above playback instability or<br>
halt can be avoided. However, the playback means needs to<br>
perform an operation of outputting a video signal in a unit<br>
of a frame period of 1/24 second or 1/29.94 second, and so<br>
is unlikely to have an enough capacity left to conduct such<br>
check. Accordingly, the above playback instability and halt<br>
are inevitable. In a consumer product industry for<br>
manufacturing BD-ROM playback apparatuses, however, a strict<br>
quality standard is required for video playback. Therefore,<br>
even if the playback means does not have a capacity to check<br><br>
digital streams, the above playback instability and halt cannot be tolerated.<br>
The present invention aims to provide a playback apparatus that can<br>
prevent playback instability and halt when playing back a digital stream recorded<br>
on a BD-ROM and a digital stream recorded on a hard disk as one stream<br>
sequence, even if playback means does not have an available capacity to check<br>
an unstable digital stream.<br>
Means of Solving the Problems<br>
The stated aim can be achieved by a playback apparatus for playing back<br>
a stream sequence, including: a playback unit; a package management unit<br>
operable to, when storage locations for storing digital streams which constitute<br>
the stream sequence are on separate recording media, set each digital stream to<br>
an enable status of being recognizable by the playback unit or a disable status of<br>
being unrecognizable by the playback unit; and an application execution unit<br>
operable to execute an application to control access to any of the recording<br>
media, wherein the playback unit starts playing back the stream sequence if at<br>
least one of the digital streams is in the enable status, and while one of the at<br>
least one of the digital streams is being played back by the playback unit, the<br>
package management unit changes a remaining digital stream, which is set to<br>
the disable status, to the enable status, or a remaining digital stream, which is<br>
set to the enable status and is not being played back, to the disable status,<br>
according to a request from the application execution unit.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
According to this construction, each digital stream is switched between the<br><br>
enable status and the disable status according to the application, thereby<br>
determining whether the digital stream is to be played back by the playback unit.<br>
The application that realizes access to the recording medium has this right to<br>
determine whether the digital stream is to be played back by the playback unit.<br>
Accordingly, in the case where it cannot be confirmed that the digital stream has<br>
reliably been written to the recording medium, the application sets the digital<br>
stream to the disable status, so that the digital stream is treated as nonexistent.<br>
As a result, the playback unit will not erroneously play back an unstable digital<br>
stream. Hence unstable or intermittent video playback can be prevented.<br>

(b) providing the generated virtual volume management<br>
information to the playback unit, and the change to the disable<br>
status by the package management unit is performed by removing<br>
the file management information stored on the rewritable -<br>
recording medium from the virtual volume management<br>
information.<br>
[0010]<br>
Here, the change to the enable status by the package<br>
management unit may include a process of changing an attribute<br>
of the file on the -rewritable recording medium to a read-only<br>
attribute, wherein the change to the disable status by the<br>
package management unit includes a process of changing the<br>
attribute of the file on the rewritable recording medium to<br>
a rewritable attribute.<br>
Control is exercised according to the application so<br>
that, during playback of one digital stream, a remaining<br>
digital stream is downloaded to the recording medium. Once<br>
the playback of the digital stream has completed, the<br>
downloaded digital stream is set to the enable status, to<br>
allow the playback unit to playback the written digital stream.<br>
[0011]<br>
If the writing of the remaining digital stream has not<br>
completed during the playback of the digital stream, the<br>
remaining digital stream remains in the disable status, to<br>
keep the digital stream from being played back by the playback<br>
unit. Since the playability of a digital stream is set in<br>
accordance with the progress of download, the playback of<br>
a digital stream in the stream sequence and the download of<br><br>
a digital stream in the stream sequence can be executed in<br>
parallel. Suppose a digital stream recorded on a BD-ROM<br>
constitutes a movie work and a digital stream downloaded on<br>
a hard disk constitutes a trailer. This being the case, it<br>
is possible to download the trailer digital stream while<br>
playing back the movie work digital stream and, as soon as<br>
the playback of the movie work digital stream ends, start<br>
playing back the trailer digital stream.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br><br>
(First Embodiment)<br>
The following describes an embodiment of a recording<br>
medium according to the present invention. Firstly, a form<br>
of use out of the forms of an act of working of a playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is described<br>
below. FIG. 1 shows an exemplary form of use of the playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention. In FIG. 1, the<br>
playback apparatus according to the present invention is a<br>
playback apparatus 200. The playback apparatus 200 is<br>
submitted for use in supplying movie works in a home theatre<br>
system that includes a remote control 300 and a television<br>
400.<br>
An exemplary form of use of the playback apparatus<br>
according to the present invention is as described above.<br>
A recording medium targeted for playback by the playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is described<br>
next. The recording medium played by the playback apparatus according to the present invention is a BD-ROM. FIG. 2 shows<br>
an internal structure of the BD-ROM.<br>
The BD-ROM is shown at the fourth tier in the drawing,<br>
while a track on the BD-ROM is shown at the third tier. The<br>
track depicted here results from a track spiraling from an<br>
inner circumference to an outer circumference of the BD-ROM<br>
having been drawn out to the sides. This track is made up<br>
of a lead-in area, a volume area, and a lead-out area. The<br><br>
volume area in FIG. 2 has a layered structure made up of a<br>
physical layer, a filesystem layer, and an application layer.<br>
Expressing a format of the application layer (application<br>
format) of the BD-ROM using a directory structure gives the<br>
first tier in FIG. 2. A BDMV directory is placed under a ROOT<br>
directory in the BD-ROM, as shown at the first tier.<br><br>
Under the BDMV directory exist four subdirectories known<br>
as a PLAYLIST directory, a CLIPINF directory, a STREAM<br>
directory, and a BDJA directory.<br>
The STREAM directory stores a file forming a main part<br>
of a digital stream, with an extension "M2TS" being assigned<br>
to this file (00001.M2TS).<br>
The PLAYLIST directory stores a file (00001.MPLS) with<br>
an extension "MPLS".<br><br>
The CLIPINF directory stores a file (00001.CLPI) with<br>
an extension "CLPI". These files are described next.<br><avclip><br>
The file with the extension "M2TS" is described firstly.<br>
FIG. 3 schematically shows how the file with the extension<br>
"M2TS" is structured. The file with the extension "M2TS"<br>
(00001.M2TS, 00002.M2TS, 00003.M2TS, ...) stores anAVClip.<br>
The AVClip (middle tier) is constituted by multiplexing TS<br>
packets resulting from the conversion of a video stream<br>
composed of a plurality of video frames (pictures pjl, pj2,<br>
pj3) and an audio stream composed of a plurality of audio<br>
frames (upper first tier) firstly to PES packets (upper second<br><br>
tier) and then to TS packets (upper third tier) and the<br>
conversion of a subtitle Presentation Graphics stream (PG<br>
stream at the lower first tier) and an Interactive Graphics<br>
stream (IG stream at the lower first tier) to TS packets (lower<br>
third tier) in the same manner.<br>
Apart from the AVClip obtained through multiplexing as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, there also exist AVClips that do not result<br>
from multiplexing. Such AVClips are called SubClips, and<br>
include AVClips constituting an audio stream, a graphics<br>
stream, a text subtitle stream (TextSTStream) , and the like.<br><clip information><br>
The file with the extension "CLPI" (00001.CLPI) is a<br>
piece of Clip information corresponding to an AVClip. Clip<br>
information, beingmanagement information, contains an EP_map<br>
showing a head location of a GOP and information such as an<br>
encoding format, a frame rate, a bit rate, and a resolution<br>
of streams in the AVClip.<br><playlist information><br>
The file with the extension "MPLS" (00001.MPLS) stores<br>
PlayList (PL) information. The PL information defines a<br>
playlist by referring to AVClips. FIG. 4 shows a structure<br>
of the PL information. As shown on the left side of the drawing, the PL information includes MainPath information, PLMark<br>
information, and SubPath information.<br><br>
The MainPath information (MainPath()) is composed of<br><br>
a plurality of pieces of Playltem information (Playltem()),<br>
as indicated by the arrows mpl. A Playltem is a playback<br>
section defined by specifying an In_Time and an Out_Time on<br>
one or more AVClip time axes. A playlist (PL) composed of<br>
a plurality of playback sections is defined by placing a<br>
plurality of pieces of Playltem information. The arrows mp2<br>
in FIG. 4 show a close up of an internal structure of Playltem<br>
information. As shown in the drawing", the Playltem<br>
information is composed of an In_time, an Out_time, and a<br>
Clip_information_file_name showing a corresponding AVClip.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a relationship between an AVClip and a PL. The<br>
first tier shows a time axis of the AVClip, while the second<br>
tier shows a time axis of the PL. The PL information-includes<br>
three pieces of Playltem information Playltems#l, #2, and<br>
#3, with three playback sections being defined by the In_times<br>
and Out_times of Playltems#1, #2, and #3. A different time<br>
axis from the AVClip is defined when these playback sections<br>
are arranged in line. This is the PL time axis shown at the<br>
second tier. Defining a different time axis from the AVClip<br>
is thus enabled by the definitions in the Playltem information .<br>
As a rule, one AVClip is specified at any one time, though<br>
batch specification of a plurality of AVClips is also possible.<br>
Batch specification of AVClips is performed using a plurality<br>
of Clip_Inf ormation_file_names in Playltem information. FIG.<br>
6 shows the batch specification of AVClips using four<br>
Clip Information_file_names. The first to fourth tiers in<br>
the drawing show four AVClip time axes (time axes of AVClips#1,<br><br>
#2, #3, and #4), while the fifth tier shows a PL time axis.<br>
The four time axes are specified with four<br>
Clip_Information_file_names included in the Playltem<br>
information. This allows four alternatively playable<br>
playback sections to be defined by an In_time and Out_time<br>
of the Playltem. As a result, a section composed of a plurality<br>
of pieces of switchable angle video (so-called multi-angle<br>
section) is defined on the' PL time axis.<br><br>
The PLMark information (PLmark()) specifies an<br>
arbitrary section on a PL time axis as a chapter. FIG. 7 shows<br>
an internal structure of the PLMark information, which<br>
includes a ref_to_PlayItem_Id and a Mark_time_stamp, as<br>
indicated by the arrows pm1. FIG. 8 shows the definition of<br>
chapters using PLmarks. The first tier in the drawing shows<br>
the AVClip time axis, while the second tier shows the PL time<br>
axis . The arrows pk1 and pk2 in FIG. 8 show the specification<br>
of a Playltem (ref_to_PlayItem_Id) and a point in time<br>
(mark_time_stamp) in PLMarks. Three chapters (Chapters#l,<br>
#2, and #3) are defined on the PL time axis as a result of<br>
these specifications. This completes the description of<br>
PLmarks. The SubPath information is described next.<br><br>
The SubPath information (SubPath () ) defines one or more<br>
playback sections by specifying an In_Time and an Out_Time<br>
on a SubClip time axis, and has an internal structure shown<br>
in FIG. 9. As illustrated, the SubPath information is composed<br>
of a plurality of pieces of SubPlayltem information<br><br>
(SubPlayltem() ) as indicated by the arrows shl. In a close<br>
up marked by the arrows sh2, SubPlayltem information is composed of a Clip_information_file_name, an In_ time, an<br>
Out_time, a Sync_PlayItem_Id, and a<br>
Sync_start_Pts_of_PlayItem. An In_Time and an Out_Time on<br>
the SubClip time axis are specified using the<br>
Clip_information_file_name, the In_time, and the Out_time<br>
included in the SubPlayltem information. The<br>
Sync_PlayItem_Id and the Sync_start_Pts_of_PlayItem specify<br>
synchronization of a playback section on the SubClip time<br>
axis with the PL time axis. This allows processing on both<br>
the SubClip time axis and the PL time axis to proceed in sync<br>
with one another.<br><br>
FIG. 10 shows the sync specification and the definition<br>
of a playback section on the SubClip time axis. The first<br>
tier in the drawing shows the PL time axis, while the second<br>
tier shows the SubClip time axis. A SubPlayltem. IN_time and<br>
a SubPlayltem.Out_time in the drawing respectively show the<br>
start and end of a playback section. Thus, it is apparent<br>
that a playback section is also defined on the SubClip time<br>
axis. A Sync_PlayItem_Id marked by the arrow Sn1 shows the<br>
sync specification of a Playltem, while a<br>
sync_start_PTS_of_PlayItemmarked by the arrow Sn2 specifies<br>
a- point during the Playltem on the PL time axis.<br>
[0025]<br>
A feature of PL information in BD-ROMS is that it makes<br>
possible the definition of multi-angle sections that enable<br><br>
AVClips to be switched and sync sections that enable AVClips<br>
and SubClips to be synchronized. Clip information and PL<br>
information described above are classified as "static<br>
scenarios".	<br>
The following describes "dynamic scenarios". Here,<br>
"dynamic" refers to the fact "that the contents" of playback<br>
controls changes due to user key events and status changes<br>
in the playback apparatus 200. With BD-ROMs, playback<br>
controls can be described using a same description as Java<br>
(TM) applications. That is, with BD-ROMs, Java (TM|<br>
applications act as dynamic scenarios.<br><java applications><br>
The following describes Java (TM) applications . A Java<br>
(TM) application is composed of one or more xlet programs<br>
loaded in a heap area (also called a work memory) of a virtual<br>
machine . An application is constituted from the xlet programs<br>
loaded in the work memory, as well as data. The structure<br>
of the Java (TM) application is as described above.<br>
An actual Java (TM) application is a Java (TM) archive<br>
file (00001.jar, 00002.jar) stored in the BDJAdirectory under<br>
the BDMV directory shown in FIG. 2. Java (TM) archive files<br>
are described below with reference to FIG. 11.<br><java archive file><br>
The Java (TM) archive file (00001.JAR in FIG. 2) is a<br>
collection of one or more class files and data files etc.<br>
FIG. 11A shows programs and data collected in the archive<br><br>
file. The data in FIG. 11A is a plurality of files collected<br>
by a Java (TM) archiver and arranged into a directory structure<br>
shown within the frame. This directory structure includes<br>
a Root directory,a Java (TM) directory, and an image directory,<br>
with a common pkg file, class files (aaa.class-, bbb.class),<br>
and a menu.jpg file being placed within the respective<br>
directories. The Java (TM) archive file is a result of the<br>
java (TM) archiver having collected these files together.<br>
The class files and data are expanded when read from the BD-ROM<br>
to a cache, and treated in the cache as a plurality of files<br>
existing in directories. The five-digit numerical value<br>
"zzzzz" in the filename of the Java (TM) archive file shows<br>
an ID of the application (application ID) . By referring to<br>
this numerical value in the filename when the Java (TM) archive<br>
file has been read to the cache, it is possible to extract<br>
data as well as programs constituting an arbitrary Java (TM)<br>
application.<br>
The class files (aaa.class, bbb.class) in FIG. 11A<br>
correspond to the above xlet programs. Playback procedures<br>
in an operating mode (BD-J) supported by a Java (TM) system<br>
requirement are defined using xlet programs which are<br>
instances of these class files. An xlet program is a Java<br>
(TM) program capable of using a JMF (Java (TM) Media FrameWork)<br>
interface, and performs processing based on key events in<br>
accordance with JMF etc. The xlet program is capable of JMF<br>
processing, and so can instruct the playback apparatus 200<br>
to play back a PlayList by generating a JMF instance (PlayList<br><br>
Object) corresponding to an MPLS file . Also, the xlet program<br>
can execute processes that are unique to the BD-ROM playback<br>
apparatus 200 by writing calls for API functions.<br>
Furthermore, the xlet program can execute procedures<br>
for accessing websites and downloading content. This enables<br>
playback of original works created by mixing downloaded<br>
content with playlists.<br>
The class file of the xlet program is described next.<br>
FIG. 11B shows an internal structure of the class file. As<br>
shown in FIG. 11B, this class file, similar to a normal class<br>
file, is composed of a constant pool, an interface, and methods<br>
1, 2, 3, ... , n. The methods in the class file include methods<br>
(EventListeners) that are triggered by preregistered key<br>
events and methods for calling API functions in the BD-ROM<br>
playback apparatus 200 . Computation procedures and the like<br>
in these methods are described by employing local variables<br>
allocated to a given method and arguments when the method<br>
is called. The Java (TM) archive file is as described above.<br>
This completes the description of the BD-ROM. The following<br>
describes an internal structure of the playback apparatus<br>
according to the present invention.<br><br><playback apparatus><br>
FIG. 12 shows the internal structure of the playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention. The playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention is manufactured<br>
based on this internal structure. The playback apparatus<br><br>
according to the present invention is roughly made up of two<br>
parts that are a system LSI and a drive device. The playback<br>
apparatus according to the present invention can be<br>
manufacturedby mounting these parts on a cabinet and substrate<br>
of the apparatus. The system LSI is an integrated circuit<br>
including various processing units for achieving the<br>
functions of the playback apparatus. The playback apparatus<br>
manufactured in this way includes a-BD-ROM drive 1, a Read<br>
Buffer 2, a demultiplexer 3, a Video Decoder 4, a Video Plane<br>
5, a P-Graphics Decoder 6, a Presentation Graphics Plane 7,<br>
a composition unit 8, a Font Generator 9, an I-Graphics Decoder<br>
10, a switch 11, an Interactive Graphics Plane 12, a composition<br>
unit 13, a CLUT unit 14, a CLUT unit 15, an Audio Decoder<br>
16, a Network Device 17, a Local Storage 18, a Read Buffer<br>
19, a demultiplexer 20, an instruction ROM 21, a user event<br>
processing unit 22, a PSR set 23, a CPU 24, a scenario memory<br>
25, a Local Memory 26, and a switch 27.<br><br>
Elements pertaining to playback of AVClips recorded on<br>
the BD-ROM (the BD drive 1 - the Audio Decoder 16) are described<br>
firstly.<br>
The BD-ROM drive 1 loads/ejects the BD-ROM, and accesses<br>
the BD-ROM.<br>
The Read Buffer 2 is a FIFO memory in which TS packets<br>
read from the BD-ROM are stored on a first-in first-out basis .<br><br>
The demultiplexer (De-MUX) 3 reads TS packets from the<br>
Read Buffer 2 and converts these TS packets to PES packets.<br><br>
PES packets having PIDs set by the CPU 24 are then output<br>
to any of the Video Decoder 4, the P-Graphics Decoder 6, the<br>
I-Graphics Decoder 10, and the Audio Decoder 16.<br>
The Video Decoder 4 decodes a plurality of PES packets<br>
output from the demultiplexer 3 to obtain pictures in<br>
uncompressed format, and writes these pictures to the Video<br>
Plane 5 .<br>
The Video Plane 5 is for storing uncompressed pictures A plane is a memory area in the playback apparatus for storing<br>
one screen worth of pixel data. The Video Plane 5 has a 1920<br>
× 1080 resolution, with storedpicture data being constituted<br>
from pixel data expressed by 16-bit YUV. In the Video Plane<br>
5, playback video in a video stream can be scaled per frame.<br>
Scaling involves changing playback video per frame to either<br>
1/4 (quarter) or 1/1 (full-scale) of the entire Video Plane<br>
5. Such scaling is executed in a BD-J mode in accordance with<br>
an instruction from the CPU 24, enabling screen production<br>
whereby a playback image of a video stream is relegated to<br>
a corner of the screen or projected over the whole screen.<br><br>
The P-Graphics Decoder 6 decodes a Presentation graphic<br>
stream read from the BD-ROM and writes uncompressed graphics<br>
to the Presentation Graphics Plane 7. Subtitles appear on<br>
the screen as a result of the graphics stream being decoded.<br>
The Presentation Graphics Plane 7, being a memory with<br>
room for one screen worth of data, is able to store one screen<br>
worth of uncompressed graphics . This plane has a 1920 × 1080<br><br>
resolution, with each pixel of the uncompressed graphics on<br>
the Presentation Graphics Plane 7 being expressed by an 8-bit<br>
index color. The uncompressed graphics stored on the<br>
Presentation Graphics Plane 7 are submitted for display by<br>
converting such index colors using a CLUT (Color Lookup Table ) .<br>
The composition unit 8 composites uncompressed picture<br>
data (i) stored on the Video Plane 5 with the storage contents<br>
of the Presentation Graphics Plane 7.<br>
The Font Generator 9 uses a character font to expand<br>
text code included in a textST stream in a bitmap, and writes<br>
the expanded code to the Presentation Graphics Plane 7.<br>
The I-Graphics Decoder 10 decodes an IG stream read from<br>
the BD-ROM or the Local Storage 18 in an HDMVmode, and writes<br>
uncompressed graphics to the Interactive Graphics Plane 12.<br><br>
The switch 11 selectively writes one of a font-sequence<br>
generated by the Font Generator 9 and graphics resulting from<br>
the decoding by the P-Graphics Decoder 6, to the Presentation<br>
Graphics Plane 7.<br>
The Interactive Graphics Plane 12 is written with<br>
uncompressed graphics resulting from the decoding by the<br>
I-Graphics Decoder 10. Characters and graphics drawn by an<br>
application are written onto the Interactive Graphics Plane<br>
12 in the BD-J mode.<br>
The composition unit 13 composites the storage contents<br>
of the Interactive Graphics Plane 12 with a composite image<br><br>
output from the composition unit 8 (i.e. composition of<br>
uncompressed picture data and storage contents of the<br>
Presentation Graphics Plane 7). This compositing enables<br>
characters and graphics written to the I-Graphics Decoder<br>
10 by an application to be overlaid on uncompressed picture<br>
data and displayed.<br>
The CLUT unit 14 converts index colors in the<br>
uncompressed graphics stored on the Video Plane 5 to Y/Cr/Cb.<br>
The CLUT unit 15 converts index colors in the<br>
uncompressed graphics stored on the Interactive Graphics<br>
Plane 12 to Y/Cr/Cb.<br>
The Audio Decoder 16 decodes PES packets output from<br>
the demultiplexer 3 and outputs uncompressed audio data.<br>
The elements pertaining to AVClip playback are as<br>
described above. The following describes elements<br>
pertaining to operations in the BD-J mode (the Network Device<br>
17 - the De-mux 20).<br>
The Network Device 17 realizes a communication function<br>
in the playback apparatus. In the case of a Java (TM)<br>
application specifying an URL in the BD-J mode, the Network<br>
Device 17 establishes a TCP or FTP connection etc. with a<br>
website indicated by the URL. The Java (TM) application is<br>
made to download from the website as a result of such a<br>
connection being established.<br>
The Local Storage 18 is a hard disk for storing content<br><br>
supplied from communication media and recording media other<br>
than the BD-ROM, such as content downloaded from a website<br>
via a connection establishedby the Network Device 17 , together<br>
with metadata. The metadata is information for binding and<br>
managing downloaded content in the Local Storage 18. By<br>
accessing the Local Storage 18, an application in the BD-J<br>
mode can perform a variety of processes using the downloaded<br>
content.<br><br>
The Read Buffer 19 is a FIFO memory that stores TS packets<br>
constituting a SubClip on a first-in first-out basis in the<br>
case of such a SubClip being included in the downloaded content<br>
stored on the Local Storage 18.<br>
The demultiplexer (De-MUX) 20 reads TS packets from the<br>
Read Buffer 19 and converts the read TS packets to PES packets .<br>
PES packets having specific PIDs are then output to the Font<br>
Generator 9, the I-Graphics Decoder 10, and the Audio Decoder<br>
16.<br>
The above elements from the Network Device 17 to the<br>
De-mux 20 enable content downloaded by a Java (TM) application<br>
via a network to be played in a similar manner to content<br>
recorded on the BD-ROM. The following describes elements for<br>
realizing collective controls in the playback apparatus (the<br>
instruction ROM 21 - the switch 27).<br>
The instruction ROM 21 stores software that defines<br>
controls relating to the playback apparatus.<br><br>
The user event processing unit 22, in response to a key<br>
operation of the remote control or the front panel of the<br>
playback apparatus, outputs a user event for performing a<br>
corresponding operation-to the CPU 24.<br>
The PSR set 23 is a set of registers internal to the<br>
playback apparatus, and is composed of 64 Player Status<br>
Registers (PSRs) and 4096 General Purpose Registers (GPRs).<br>
PSR4 to PSR8 are used to express a current playback point.<br><br>
PSR4 indicates a title of the current playback point<br>
as a result of having been set to a value from 1 to 100 . Setting<br>
PSR4 to 0 indicates that the current playback point is a top<br>
menu.<br>
PSR5 indicates a chapter number of the current playback<br>
point as a result of having been set to a value from 1 to<br>
999. Setting PSR5 to OxFFFF indicates a null chapter number<br>
in the playback apparatus.<br>
PSR6 indicates a number of a PL (current PL) to which<br>
the current playback point belongs as a result of having been<br>
set to a value from 0 to 999.<br>
PSR7 indicates a number of a Playltem (current Playltem)<br>
to which the current playback point belongs as a result of<br>
having been set to a value from 0 to 255.<br>
PSR8 indicates the current playback point (current PTM<br>
(Presentation TiMe)) using 45 KHz time accuracy, as a result<br>
of having been set to a value from 0 to OxFFFFFFFF. These<br>
PSR4 to PSR8 enable the current playback point to be identified<br><br>
on the time axis shown in FIG. 8.<br><br>
The CPU 24 runs software stored in the instruction ROM<br>
21 to execute controls relating to the entire playback<br>
apparatus. These controls change dynamically depending on<br>
user events output from the user event processing unit 22<br>
and each PSR value in the PSR set 23.<br>
The scenario memory 25 is for storing current PL<br>
information and current Clip information. The current PL<br>
information is a piece of PL information recorded on the BD-ROM<br>
that is currently targeted for processing. The current Clip<br>
information is a piece of Clip information recorded on the<br>
BD-ROM that is currently targeted for processing.<br>
The Local Memory 2 6 is a cache memory for temporarily<br>
storing the recorded contents of the BD-ROM, given a low reading<br>
speed from the BD-ROM. The provision of the Local Memory 2 6<br>
allows an application in the BD-J mode to run efficiently.<br>
The switch 27 selectively delivers data read from the<br>
BD-ROM and the Local Storage 18 to one of the Read Buffer<br>
2, the Read Buffer 19, the scenario memory 25, and the Local<br>
Memory 26.<br>
The hardware structure of the playback apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment is as described above. The<br>
following describes a filesystem structure in the playback<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment.<br>
FIG. 13A shows a directory structure in the Local Storage<br><br>
18.<br>
In this directory structure, a subdirectory "DLDAT" is<br>
located under a ROOT directory, and under this are<br>
subdirectories "PKGOOOOl" and "PKG00002". "PKG00001" and<br>
"PKG000.02" are each a volume label of a BD-ROM, and indicate<br>
that a directory corresponding to a BD-ROM having a volume<br>
label "PKG00001" and a directory corresponding to a BD-ROM<br>
having a volume label "PKG00002" are present on the Local<br>
Storage 18. The subdirectory "PKG00001" shoves a location of<br>
downloaded data corresponding to the BD-ROM with the volume<br>
label "PKG00001". Providing subdirectories in a directory<br>
corresponding to each BD-ROM allows downloaded data relating<br>
to each BD-ROM to be stored separately. Under these<br>
subdirectories are stored PlayList information, Clip<br>
information, and AVClips, similar to what is stored on the<br>
BD-ROM. There also additionally exist a Java (TM) archive<br>
file and a stream storage location information file.<br><br>
It is supposed here that while an AVClip recorded on<br>
the BD-ROM corresponds to a movie work, an AVClip recorded<br>
on the Local Storage 18 corresponds to a trailer of a movie<br>
work currently showing at theaters. Since trailers are<br>
changed with time, a trailer of a movie work currently showing<br>
at theaters is recorded on the Local Storage 18 as an AVClip.<br>
The stream storage location information file is<br>
explained next. The stream storage location information file<br>
is information showing a list of files constituting a Virtual<br><br>
Package. FIG. 13B shows an internal structure of the stream<br>
storage location information file. The stream storage<br>
location information file is made up of storage location<br>
information of each AVClip and Clip information constituting<br>
the Virtual Package. Each piece of storage location<br>
information is composed of identifiers of AVClips and Clip<br>
information and file paths indicating the storage locations<br>
of the AVClips and Clip information in the Local Storage 18.<br>
By referring to the storage location information, it is<br>
possible to check whether all AVClips and Clip information<br>
which constitute the Virtual Package have already been<br>
prepared when creating the Virtual Package.<br>
The filesystem structure of the playback apparatus<br>
according to this embodiment is as described above. The<br>
following describes a software structure in the playback<br>
apparatus according to this embodiment.<br>
FIG. 14 depicts elements composed of hardware and<br>
software stored on the ROM 2 4 rearranged in a layer structure .<br>
As shown in FIG. 14, the layer structure of the playback<br>
apparatus is composed of a) a first layer (BD Player Device),<br>
b) a second layer (BD Player Model), and c) a third layer<br>
(Application Runtime Environment).<br>
A hardware structure of the playback apparatus shown<br>
in FIG. 12 belongs to the first layer. The "BD Player Device"<br>
at the first layer in the drawing includes a "decoder" composed<br>
of the Video Decoder 4, the P-Graphics Decoder 6, the I-Graphics<br><br>
Decoder 10, and the Audio Decoder 16, a "plane" composed of<br>
the Video Plane 5, the Presentation Graphics Plane 7, and<br>
the Interactive Graphics Plane 12, the BD-ROM and its<br>
filesystem, and the Local Storage -18 and its filesystem.<br>
The "BD Player Model" at the second tier is composed<br>
of b1) a layer for a Presentation Engine 31 and a Virtual<br>
FileSystem 38 and b2) a layer for a Playback Control Engine<br>
32, with API functions being provided in relation to higher<br>
levels.<br><br>
The PSR set 23 and the scenario memory 25 shown in FIG.<br>
12 exist inside the Playback Control Engine 32.<br>
The "Application Runtime Environment" at the third tier<br>
is composed of c1) a stack layer that includes an HDMV module<br>
29a and a BD-J module 2 9b.<br>
The following describes the elements in this software<br>
structure.<br><hdmv module bd-j><br>
The HDMV module 2 9a decodes navigation commands and<br>
executes function calls in relation to the Playback Control<br>
Engine 32 based on the decoding result.<br><br>
The BD-J module 29b is a so-called Java (TM) platform<br>
having a hierarchical structure composed of d1-1) a Java (TM)<br>
virtual machine 30 and d1-2) middleware for the Java (TM)<br>
virtual machine to operate.<br><br><java virtual machine><br>
The Java (TM) virtual machine 30 loads xlet programs<br>
constituting applications into a work memory, decodes the<br>
xlet programs, and performs controls on lower layers in<br>
accordance with the decoding results. To perform these<br>
controls, the Java (TM) virtual machine 30 issues a method<br>
to the middleware, has the middleware replace the method with<br>
a function call corresponding to the BD playback apparatus,<br>
and issues the function call to the Playback Control Engine<br>
32.<br><br><internal structure of the java virtual machine><br>
The following describes an internal structure of the<br>
Java (TM) virtual machine 30. FIG. 15 shows the internal<br>
structure of the Java (TM) virtual machine 30. As shown in<br>
FIG. 15, the Java (TM) virtual machine 30 is constituted from<br>
the CPU 24 shown in FIG. 12, a user class loader 52, a method<br>
area 53, a work memory 54, threads 55a, 55b, ... , 55n, and<br>
Java (TM) stacks 56a, 56b, ... , 56n.<br><br>
The user class loader 52 reads class files in Java (TM)<br>
archive files in the BDJA directory from the Local Memory<br>
26 or the like and stores the read class files in the method<br>
area 53. The reading of a class file by the user class loader<br>
52 is performed as a result of an applicationmanager 36 sending<br>
a read instruction specifying a file path to the user class<br>
loader 52. If the file path indicates the Local Memory 26,<br><br>
the user class loader 52 reads a class file in a Java (TM)<br>
archive file constituting an application from the Local Memory<br>
26 to the work memory 54. If the file path indicates a directory<br>
in a FileSystem, the user class loader 52 reads a class file<br>
in a Java (TM) archive file constituting an application from<br>
the BD-ROM or the Local Storage 18 to the work memory 54.<br>
The method area 53 store class files read from the Local<br>
Memory 26 by the user class loader 52.<br>
The work memory 54 is a so-called heap area storing<br>
instances of various class files. The work memory 54 stores<br>
instances corresponding to resident applications and class<br>
files read to the method area 53. Such an instance is an xlet<br>
program constituting an application that is made executable<br>
by placing the xlet program in the work memory 54.<br>
The threads 55a, 55b, ..., 55n are logical execution<br>
entities for executing methods stored in the work memory 54 .<br>
These threads perform calculations using local variables and<br>
arguments stored in operand stacks as operands, and store<br>
calculation results in local variables or operand stacks.<br>
The arrows ky1, ky2, ... , kyn in the drawing symbolically<br>
indicate the supply of methods from the work memory 54 to<br>
the threads 55a, 55b, ... , 55n. Whereas the CPU is the sole<br>
physical execution entity, there may be up to 64 logical<br>
execution entities or threads in the Java (TM) virtual machine<br>
30 . Threads can be newly created and existing threads deleted<br>
within this numerical limit, and the number of operational<br><br>
threads can be varied while the Java (TM) virtual machine<br>
30 is operating. Being able to appropriately increase the<br>
number of threads also makes it possible to run instances<br>
in parallel using a plurality of -threads for each instance,<br>
and thereby speed up the execution of instances.<br>
The Java (TM) stacks 56a, 56b, ... , 56n exist in a<br>
one-to-one ratio with the threads 55a, 55b, ... , 55n, and each<br>
has a program counter ("PC" in the drawing) and one or more<br>
frames. The program counters show which part of an instance<br>
is currently being executed. A frame is a stack-type area<br>
allocated to each call for a method, and is composed of an<br>
operand stack for storing arguments occurring at the time<br>
of the call and a local variable stack ("local variable" in<br>
the drawing) for use by the called method. Since frames are<br>
stacked on the Java (TM) stacks 56a, 56b, ... , 56n whenever<br>
a call is made, the frames of a method that calls itself<br>
recursively also get stacked one on top of the other.<br><br>
The internal structure of the Java (TM) virtual machine<br>
is as described above. The Java (TM) virtual machine having<br>
the above structure serves as an event-driven execution entity.<br>
This completes the description of the Java (TM) virtual<br>
machine.<br>
Presentation Engine 31&gt;<br>
The Presentation Engine 31 executes AV playback<br>
functions . The AV playback functions of a playback apparatus<br>
are a traditional group of functions inherited from DVD players<br><br>
and CD players, including Play, Stop, Pause On, Pause Off,<br>
Still Of f, Forward Play (speed), Backward Play (speed), Audio<br>
Change, Subtitle Change, and Angle Change. To realize these<br>
AV playback functions, the Presentation Engine 31 controls<br>
the Video Decoder 4, the P-Graphics Decoder 6, the I-Graphics<br>
Decoder 10, and the Audio Decoder 16 to decode a portion of<br>
an AVClip read to the Read Buffer 2 that corresponds to a<br>
desired time . By having the place indicated by PSR8 (current<br>
PTM) decoded as the desired time, arbitrary points in an AVClip<br>
can be rendered playable. <playback control engine><br>
The Playback Control Engine (PCE) 32 executes various<br>
functions including (i) playback controls on PlayLists and<br>
(ii) acquiring/setting the status of the PSR set 23. The<br>
playback control function for PLs involves having the<br>
Presentation Engine 31 execute Play and Stop out of the above<br>
AV playback functions, in accordance with current PL<br>
information and Clip information. These functions (i) and<br>
(ii) are executed according to function calls from the HDMV<br>
module 2 9a and the BD-J module 2 9b.<br><br>
Synchronization of the processing by the Playback Control<br>
Engine 32 with the processing by the Java (TM) virtual machine<br>
is described next. The Playback Control Engine 32 executes<br>
processing based on PL information when a function is called.<br>
This processing is performed for the duration of the AVClip<br>
for playback, whether the playback time is 15 minutes or 30<br><br>
minutes. A problem here is a time lag between when the Java<br>
virtual machine 30 returns a success response and when the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 actually ends the processing. The<br>
Java virtual machine 30, being an event-driven execution<br>
entity, returns a response indicating whether playback was<br>
successful or not immediately after the call, whereas the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 ends the playback of the AVClip<br>
and Playltem after the- 15 or 30-minute playback duration has<br>
elapsed. Thus, the time at which a success response is<br>
returned to an application cannot be used as a basis for gauging-<br>
the end of processing 15 or 30 minutes later. Gauging the<br>
end of processing becomes all the more difficult when<br>
fast-forwarding or rewinding is performed during PL playback<br>
since the playback time of 15 or 30 minutes is then subject<br>
to change. In view of this, the Playback Control Engine 32<br>
outputs events indicating the end of Playltem and AVClip<br>
playback to an application when playback of a respective<br>
Playltem or AVClip ends . This output enables the application<br>
to know the points at which the Playback Control Engine 32<br>
concluded Playltem and AVClip playback.<br><br>
This completes the description of the Java (TM) virtual<br>
machine, the Network Device 31, and the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 . The controls on the Playback Control Engine 32 by the<br>
Java virtual machine are performed via a Virtual Package.<br>
To realize the controls on the Playback Control Engine 32<br>
via a Virtual Package, the playback apparatus includes the<br>
following elements (a network management module 37, a Virtual<br><br>
FileSystem unit 38, a management information conversion<br>
module 39, and a method execution module 40) . These elements<br>
are described next.<br><network management module><br>
The NetworkManagement Module 37 downloads data required<br>
for creating Virtual Packages from websites administrated<br>
by the providers of movie works, in accordance with method<br>
calls from applications. This data includes stream storage<br>
location information files, PlayList information, Clip<br>
information, and AVClips. When download requests are made<br>
by applications in the Work memory 54, the network management<br>
module 37. downloads data required for creating Virtual<br>
Packages via a network and writes the downloaded data to the<br>
Local Storage 18.<br><br>
An order of writing in the download is: a stream storage<br>
location information file -&gt; PlayList information —&gt; a<br>
plurality of pieces of Clip information —&gt; a plurality of<br>
AVClips.<br>
Once the writing of the PlayList information to the<br>
plurality of pieces of Clip information has completed, the<br>
creation of a Virtual Package becomes possible.<br><virtual filesystem unit><br>
The Virtual FileSystem unit 38 is an element belonging<br>
to the second layer that creates Virtual Packages in accordance<br>
with method calls fromapplications . The creationof a Virtual<br><br>
Package includes a process to manage a status of each AVClip<br>
constituting the Virtual Package and a process to generate<br>
Virtual Package information.<br>
1. Virtual Package Information<br>
Virtual Package information expands volume management<br>
information on the BD-ROM. The volume management information<br>
referred to here defines a directory - file structure existing<br>
on a recording medium, and is composed of directory management<br>
information relating to directories and file management<br>
information relating to files.<br>
The Virtual Package information expands.the directory<br>
- file structure on the BD-ROM, by adding new file management<br>
information to the volume management information showing the<br>
directory - file structure of the BD-ROM. The file management<br>
information added to the volume management information<br>
relates to PlayList information, Clip information, and<br>
AVClips existing on the Local Storage 18. Generating the<br>
Virtual Package information to which this file management<br>
information has been added and providing this Virtual Package<br>
information to the Playback Control Engine 32 enables the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 to recognize the PlayList<br>
information, the Clip information, and the AVClips stored<br>
on the Local Storage 18 as existing on the BD-ROM. FIG. 16<br>
shows an exemplary generation of Virtual Package information<br>
by the Virtual FileSystem unit 38. At the top left of FIG.<br>
16 is the directory - file structure on the BD-ROM, this being<br><br>
the same as FIG. 2. At the bottom left is the directory -<br>
file structure on the Local Storage 18, this being the same<br>
as FIG. 13A. File management information relating to the<br>
PlayList information, the Clip information, and the AVClips<br>
on the Local Storage 18 is added to the volume management<br>
information on the BD-ROM.<br><br>
Specifically:<br>
i) file management information relating to a PlayList<br>
(00002 .MPLS) on the Local Storage 18 is added to the directory<br>
management information of the MPLS directory in the BD volume<br>
management information;<br>
ii) file management information relating to Clip<br>
information#2, #3, and #4 (00002.CLPI, 00003.CLPI,<br>
00004.CLPI) on-the Local Storage 18 is added to the directory<br>
management information of the CLPI directory in the BD volume<br>
management information; and<br>
iii) file management information relating to AVClips#2,<br>
#3, and #4 (00002.M2TS, 00003.M2TS, 00004.M2TS) on the Local<br>
Storage 18 is added to the directory management information<br>
of the STREAM directory in the BD volume management<br>
information.<br>
Virtual Package information is thus obtained. In other<br>
words, Virtual Package information is volume management<br>
information that has been generated as a result of the above<br>
addition.<br>
This Virtual Package information is then provided to<br><br>
the Playback Control Engine 32, which is thereby able to treat<br>
the PlayList information, the Clip information, and the<br>
AVClips on the Local Storage 18 on an equal basis with PlayList<br>
information, Clip information, and AVClips on the BD-ROM.<br>
The generation of Virtual Package information is as described<br>
above. The following describes status management by the<br>
Virtual FileSystem unit 38.<br>
3. enable and disable<br>
"Status management" mentioned here is management of<br>
whether an AVClip which constitutes a Virtual Package is in<br>
an enable status or a disable' status . When a piece of Playltem<br>
information in PlayList information is targeted for<br>
multi-angle, each AVClip which forms a multi-angle section<br>
is subjected to enable/disable status management. When<br>
SubPlayltem information is present in Playltem information,<br>
an AVClip indicated by a Clip_information_file_name of the<br>
SubP lay I tern in format ion is subjected to enable/disable status<br>
management, too.<br>
FIG. 17A shows an example of status management by the<br>
Virtual FileSystem unit 38. As illustrated, an AVClip has<br>
two statuses that are "enable" and "disable". "Enable"<br>
indicates that Clip information and an AVClip corresponding<br>
to the Clip information exist on the Local Storage 18 and<br>
the AVClip is set in Read Only Mode.<br>
Meanwhile, "disable" indicates that Clip information<br>
exists on the Local Storage 18 but an AVClip corresponding<br>
to the Clip information is either absent on the Local Storage<br><br>
18 (Missing Stream) or, even if present, deletable.<br>
An AVClip in the disable status is treated as deletable.<br>
Accordingly, when the capacity of the Local Storage 18 is<br>
not enough, an AVClip in the disable status is subjected to<br>
deletion.<br>
Therefore, when an AVClip is downloaded to the Local<br>
Storage 18, the Playback Control Engine 32 treats the<br>
downloaded AVClip as nonexistent, unless the Virtual<br>
FileSystem unit 38 changes the AVClip to the enable status.<br>
Since the Playback Control Engine 32 does not recognize the<br>
AVClip on the Local Storage 18 in the absence of an action<br>
of the Virtual FileSystem unit 38, the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 can be prevented from proceeding in playback in an unstable<br>
state.<br>
3. Read Only Mode and Cancellation<br>
Read Only Mode is described next. The change to Read<br>
Only Mode is performed by rewriting file management<br>
information in volume management information on the Local<br>
Storage 18. A target of this rewriting is file management<br>
information in the PACKAGE00001 directory under the DLDAT<br>
directory in the Local Storage 18. Rewriting all file<br>
attributes in such file management information to Read-only,<br>
an AVClip on the Local Storage 18 can be kept from being<br>
rewritten. As a result, the AVClip will not be rewritten even<br>
when an application tries to access the AVClip on the Local<br>
Storage 18 during playback by the Playback Control Engine<br><br>
32, with it being possible to maintain the sameness of the<br>
AVClip during playback.<br>
When an AVClip on the-Local Storage 18 is made<br>
recognizable by the Playback Control Engine 32, an attribute<br>
of a file storing this AVClip on the Local Storage 18 is set<br>
to Read-only. Accordingly, even if an application on the Java<br>
(TM) virtual machine directly accesses the Local Storage 18,<br>
the contents of the AVClip will not be changed.<br>
Cancellation of Read Only Mode is explained next.<br>
Cancellation of Read Only Mode is performed by rewriting file<br>
management information in volume management information on<br>
the Local Storage 18, in the same way as setting to Read Only<br>
Mode. A target of this rewriting is file management<br>
information in the PACKAGE00001 directory under the DLDAT<br>
directory in the Local Storage 18. By changing an attribute<br>
of such file management information from Read-only to<br>
Re-writable, an AVClip on the Local Storage 18 is made<br>
rewritable any time. Accordingly, by changing the file<br>
management information in the Local Storage 18 to Re-writable<br>
immediately after the playback by the Playback-Control Engine<br>
32 ends, the AVClip on the Local Storage 18 can be targeted<br>
for deletion. This completes the description of the status<br>
management.<br>
4 . Relationship between Status Management and Virtual Package<br>
Information<br><br>
The contents of this status management can be reflected<br>
onto the generation of the Virtual Package information. Which<br>
is to say, file management information for an AVClip which is set to the disable status in the status management is not<br>
added to the volume management information of the BD-ROM,<br>
and only file management information for an AVClip which is<br>
set to the enable status in the status management is added<br>
to the volume management information of the BD-ROM. Providing<br>
such generated Virtual Package information to the Playback<br>
Control Engine 32 enables the Playback Control Engine 32 to<br>
recognize only the AVClip which is in the enable status.<br>
Suppose, of AVClip#l on the BD-ROM and AVClips#2, #3, and<br>
#4 on the Local Storage 18, AVClips#l and #2 are in the enable<br>
status whereas AVClips#3 and #4 are in the disable status.<br>
This being the case, the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 generates<br>
Virtual Package information as shown in FIG . 18 . FIG . 18 shows<br>
the generation of Virtual Package information that reflects<br>
the status management. In the drawing, file management<br>
information for AVClip#2 is added to the directory management<br>
information in the STREAM directory in the BD volume management<br>
information, but file management information for AVClips#3<br>
and #4 is not added to the directory management information<br>
in the STREAM directory in the BD volume management information.<br>
When, of the four AVClips shown at the bottom left of FIG.<br>
18, 00002.M2TS corresponding to AVClip#2 is in the enable<br>
status and 00003.M2TS and 00004.M2TS corresponding to<br>
AVClips#3 and #4 are in the disable status, a file attribute<br>
of 00002.M2TS corresponding to AVClip#2 is set to Read-only<br><br>
whilst file attributes of 00003.M2TS and 00004.M2TS<br>
corresponding to AVClips#3 and #4 are set to Re-writable in<br>
the Local-Storage 18, as shown in the drawing. As a result<br>
of -providing such generated Virtual Package information to<br>
the Playback Control Engine 32, the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 will not recognize AVClips#3 and #4 which are in the disable<br>
status.<br><br>
As mentioned above, when Clip information exists but<br>
a corresponding AVClip does not exist on the Local Storage<br>
18, the AVClip is set to the disable status. However, if not<br>
only the AVClip but also the Clip information does not exist<br>
on the Local Storage 18 despite that a file path corresponding<br>
to the Clip information is present in a stream storage location<br>
information file, it is impossible to create a Virtual Package.<br>
That is, the absence of essential Clip information in a Virtual<br>
Package affects the entire Virtual Package. 5. Provision of Virtual Package Information<br>
The following describes how the Virtual Package<br>
information gene rated in the above processes 1 to 4 isprovided.<br>
Suppose PlayList information, Clip inf ormation#2 to #4,<br>
and AVClip#2 have already been downloaded but AVClips#3 and<br>
#4 have not been downloaded, as shown in FIG. 18. If the<br>
generation of Virtual Package information is requested in<br>
such a state, the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 performs an<br>
operation shown in FIG. 19. FIG. 19 shows the creation of<br>
the Virtual Package by the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 in the<br><br>
case where the download by the network management module 37<br>
is still in progress . When the creation of the Virtual Package<br>
is requested in the state shown in the drawing (©1 VPCreate) ,<br>
the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 reads directory management<br>
information and file management information from the BD-ROM<br>
and the Local Storage 18 (©2, 3), and creates the Virtual<br>
Package. The Virtual FileSystem unit 38 then provides the<br>
Virtual Package information to the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 (©4), and to the application (©5). This enables the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 to create one stream sequence from<br>
the AVClips on the BD-ROM and the Local Storage 18 through<br>
the Virtual Package.<br>
The Virtual Package information provided to the<br>
application indicates that Clip information#3 and #4 exist<br>
but AVClips#3 and #4 do not exist. Accordingly, the<br>
application can recognize that AVClips#3 and #4 constitute<br>
the stream sequence but are nonexistent streams (Missing<br>
Streams).<br>
This completes the description of the Virtual FileSystem<br>
unit 38.<br><management information conversion module><br>
The management information conversion module 39 is a<br>
piece of middleware in the BD-J Module 29b. When an<br>
application requests generation of an instance of PlayList<br>
information in the Virtual Package, the management<br>
information conversion module 39 generates the instance of<br><br>
the PlayList information in JMF format in the Work memory<br>
54 of the Java (TM) virtual machine (PlayList object in the<br>
Work memory 54 shown in FIG. 15).<br>
This instance (PlayList object) has a "data unit" which<br>
is the PlayList information and a plurality of "method units" .<br>
A plurality of methods in a PlayList object have the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 perform various playback<br>
operations such as Play, Stop, Pause On, Pause Off, Still<br>
Off, Forward Play (speed) , Backward Play (speed) , Audio Change,<br>
Subtitle Change, and Angle Change . By calling these methods,<br>
the application can initiate or stop playback of a stream<br>
sequence defined by the PlayList.<br><br>
The PlayList information played back by the PlayList<br>
object is described below. This PlayList information is<br>
PlayList information existing on the Local Storage 18.<br>
While PlayList information on the BD-ROM refers only<br>
to AVClips on the BD-ROM, PlayList information on the Local<br>
Storage 18 is called "Progressive PlayList information" that<br>
refers to both AVClips on the BD-ROM and AVClips on the Local<br>
Storage 18.<br>
Suppose the Progressive PlayList information is made<br>
up of five pieces of Playltem information#l to #5. When the<br>
three pieces of Playltem in£ormation#l-#3 refer to Clip<br>
information on the BD-ROM whilst the remaining two pieces<br>
of Playltem information#4 and #5 refer to Clip information<br><br>
on the Local Storage 18, the Progressive PlayList information<br>
can define one stream sequence from an AVClip on the BD-ROM<br>
and AVClips on the Local Storage 18, as shown in FIG. 20A.<br>
FIG. 20A shows a PlayList playback time axis that is<br>
defined by PL information stored on the Local Storage. The<br>
first tier in the drawing shows a playback time axis of an<br>
AVClip recorded on the BD-ROM, and the second tier shows a<br>
PlayList playback time axis defined by PL information stored<br>
on the Local Storage. The third tier shows a playback time<br>
axis of AVClip#2 recorded on the Local Storage, the fourth<br>
tier shows a playback time axis of AVClip#3 recorded on the<br>
Local Storage, and the fifth tier shows a playback time axis<br>
of AVClip#4 recorded on the Local Storage.<br><br>
When Playltem information#4, Playltem information#5,<br>
and Playltem information#6 in the PlayList information<br>
specify AVClip#2, AVClip#3, andAVClip#4 as playback sections,<br>
then the Progressive PlayList information can define the<br>
AVClip on the BD-ROM and the AVClips on the Local Storage<br>
18 as one stream sequence.<br>
Here, the term "Progressive" in the Progressive PlayList<br>
information means that, if at least one of the AVClips<br>
referenced by the Playltem information which constitutes the<br>
PlayList information is in the enable status, the playback<br>
of the stream sequence can be started even when the other<br>
AVClips are in the disable status.<br><br>
FIG. 20B shows a concept of Progressive PlayList<br>
information. The second to fifth tiers in FIG. 20B correspond<br>
to the second to fifth tiers in FIG. 20A. In the case where<br>
the AVClip at the third tier in FIG. 20A and FIG. 20B is in<br>
the enable status but the AVClips at the fourth and fifth<br>
tiers are in the disable status, of the four AVClips referenced<br>
by the Progressive PlayList information, AVClips#l and #2<br>
are playable though AVClips#3 and #4 are not playable.<br>
Accordingly, the playback of the stream sequence can be started.<br>
Thus, Progressive PlayList information has a characteristic<br>
in that playback can be started speculatively if at least<br>
one AVClip is playable.<br>
In a stage where the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 has<br>
created a Virtual Package, when an application on the Work<br>
memory 54 requests generation of an instance of the Progressive<br>
PlayList information shown in FIG. 20, the management<br>
information conversion module 39 performs processing shown<br>
in FIG. 21. FIG. 21 shows generation of an instance by the<br>
management information conversion module 39.<br><br>
When the application calls a generation method to request<br>
the generation of an instance of PlayList information included<br>
in the Virtual Package (©1), the management information<br>
conversion module 39 reads the PlayList information from the<br>
scenario memory 25 (©2) , and generates a PlayList object by<br>
setting this Progressive PlayList information as a data unit<br>
and adding method units, on the Work memory 54 (03) . Once<br><br>
such a PlayList object has been obtained on the Work Memory<br>
54, the application can instruct the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 to play back the stream sequence defined by the PlayList<br>
information, by calling a method of-the PlayList object.<br>
FIG. 22 shows a call of a Play method in the PlayList<br>
object. By calling a Play method (©4), a PL playback function<br>
call is made to the Playback Control Engine 32 (®5) . As a<br>
result, the Playback Control Engine 32 reads the AVClips<br>
referenced by the PlayList information which is requested<br>
to be played back (AVClip#l on the BD-ROM and AVClip#2 on<br>
the Local Storage 18) (©6, 7), and supplies these AVClips<br>
to the decoder in sequence. This completes the description<br>
of the management information conversion module 39. <method execution module><br>
The method execution module 40 is one of the elements<br>
of the middleware in the BD-J Module 29b, and executes various<br>
methods in response to method calls from an application<br>
existing in the Java (TM) virtual machine 30. There are<br>
various methods that are executed by the method execution<br>
module 40. Characteristic methods used in the present<br>
invention are a getMissingStreams method, an enableClip<br>
method, a disableClip method, and a getDisableClips method.<br>
These methods are explained below.<br>
1. getMissingStreams Method<br>
The getMissingStreams method is a method for inquiring<br><br>
of the Virtual FileSystem unit 38 about the existence of any<br>
AVClip which is a Missing Stream, while download by the network<br>
management module 37 is still in progress.<br><br>
Suppose the Virtual Package information shown in FIG.<br>
19 is provided to an application on the Work Memory 54. Missing<br>
Streams known at the time of the Virtual Package creation<br>
are AVClips#3 and #4 . After this, when the application calls<br>
the getMissingStreams method to inquire of the Virtual<br>
FileSystem unit 38 about latest Missing Streams, the method<br>
execution module 40 performs the processing shown in FIG.<br>
23.<br>
FIG. 23 schematically shows a result of this inquiry.<br>
In the drawing, the getMissingStreammethod is called as shown<br>
by ®1, and the Virtual FileSystem unit '38 returns AVClip#4 .<br>
as a return value . Before the getMissingStreams method call,<br>
AVClips#3 and #4 are Missing Streams. After the<br>
getMissingStreams method call, on the other hand, only<br>
AVClip#4 is a Missing Stream. This indicates that AVClip#3<br>
is no longer a.Missing Stream (i.e. the download of AVClip#3<br>
has completed). In this way, an extent of elimination of<br>
Missing Streams as the download progresses can be detected.<br>
2. enableClip Method<br>
The enableClip method is a method for, when an AVClip<br>
which was a Missing Stream at the time of Virtual Package<br>
creation has become no longer a Missing Stream, setting the<br><br>
AVClip to the enable status.<br>
Suppose the enableClip method is called for AVClip#3<br>
as it becomes apparent that AVClip#3 is no longer a Missing<br>
Stream in FIG. 23. In this case, the method execution module<br>
40 performs processing shown in FIG.24. FIG.24 schematically<br>
shows a call of the enableClip method. When the enableClip<br>
method is called for AVClip#3 (©3), the application has<br>
AVCLip#3 changed to the enable status, and a success response<br>
is returned to the application (©2) . In this way, AVClips<br>
which are no longer Missing Streams in the creation of a Virtual<br>
Package can be changed to the enable status.<br>
When an AVClip is set to the enable status, the method<br>
execution module 40 has Virtual Package information including<br>
the AVClip which is newly set to the enable status, provided<br>
to the application and the Playback Control Engine 32. This<br>
allows the Playback Control Engine 32 and the application<br>
to recognize and access the AVClip newly set to the enable<br>
status . 3. disableClip Method<br>
The disableClip method is a method for setting an AVClip<br>
which is in the enable status, to the disable status. Suppose<br>
an event that the playback of AVClip#2 has completed is notified<br>
by the Playback Control Engine 32 during the playback of the<br>
Progressive PlayList information shown in FIG. 20. In this<br>
case, upon the notification of the completion of the playback<br>
of AVClip#2, the method execution module 40 performs<br><br>
processing shown in FIG. 25. FIG. 25 schematically shows a<br>
call of the disableClip method. In the drawing, when notified<br>
of the completion of the playback of AVCilp#2 as a result<br>
of the progress of the playback by the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 using an end of Clip event (®1), the application calls<br>
the disableClip method for AVClip#2 (©2) to change AVClip#2<br>
to the disable status. In this way, when the playback of the<br>
AVClip has completed, the AVClip can be changed to the disable<br>
status. AVClip#2 changed to the disable status is targeted<br>
for deletion. In the case where AVClips which constitute<br>
trailers are sequentially downloaded, by setting AVClips<br>
which have been played back in a stream sequence defined by<br>
Progressive PlayList information to the disable status one<br>
by one, these AVClips can be submitted for deletion. When<br>
an AVClip is set to the disable status, the method execution<br>
module 40 has Virtual Package information from which the AVClip<br>
newly set to the disable status has been removed, provided<br>
to the application and the Playback Control Engine 32. As<br>
a result, the Playback Control Engine 32 will not recognize<br>
the AVClip set to the disable status . It should be noted here<br>
that, when deleting an AVClip on the Local Storage 18, the<br>
middleware checks a write permission of an application which<br>
requests the deletion before executing the deletion, in order<br>
to prevent an erroneous loss of AVClips.<br>
4. getDisableClips Method<br>
The getDisableClips method is a method for inquiring<br>
about ths existence of any AVClip in the disable status. By<br><br>
calling this method, an application can obtain information<br>
as to whether any AVClip is currently in the disable status .<br>
One example of use is given below. Upon receiving a<br>
chapter skip request from a user during playback of a<br>
Progressive PlayList, the application uses this method to<br>
judge whether a jump destination AVClip is in the disable<br>
status. If the AVClip is in the disable status, a warning<br>
message such as "you cannot jump to this chapter because<br>
download is not completed" is displayed without performing<br>
a chapter skip. Inthisway, special playback such as a chapter<br>
skip can be performed during playback of a Progressive<br>
PlayList.<br>
This completes the description of the methods executed<br>
by the method execution module 40.<br>
Details of processing of the aforementioned elements<br>
are described below, with reference to flowcharts.<br>
FIG. 26 is a flowchart showing a procedure when creating<br>
a Virtual Package. A judgment is made as to whether whole<br>
Clip information corresponding to AVClips stored in a stream<br>
storage location information file is stored on the Local<br>
Storage 18 (step S1) . If there is any Clip information which<br>
is not present, a false response is returned to a call of<br>
a Virtual Package by an application (stepSlO). When not only<br>
the AVClips but also the Clip information does not exist in<br>
the Local Storage despite that a file path corresponding to<br><br>
the Clip information is included in the stream storage location<br>
information file, itis impossible to create a Virtual Package .<br>
If all pieces of Clip information written in the stream<br>
storage location information file are stored on the Local<br>
Storage 18 (step S1: YES) , on the other hand, file management<br>
information of PlayList information in the Local Storage 18<br>
is added to directory management information of a PLAYLIST<br>
directory in BD volume management information (step S2) , and<br>
file management information of Clip information in the Local<br>
Storage 18 is added to directory management information of<br>
a CLPINF directory in the BD volume management information<br>
(step S3) . After this, a loop of steps S4 to S8 is executed.<br>
This loop repeats steps S6 to S8 for each piece of Clip<br>
information on the Local Storage 18 (steps S4, S5) . A piece<br>
of Clip information subjected to the operation of the loop<br>
is denoted as Clip information x.<br>
In the loop, an AVClip corresponding to Clip information<br>
x is specified (step S6) , and a judgment is made as to whether<br>
this AVClip is in the enable status or the disable status<br>
(step S7) . If the AVClip is in the enable status, file<br>
management information of AVClip x on the Local Storage 18<br>
is added to directory management information of a STREAM<br>
directory in the BD volume management information (step S8) .<br>
If the AVClip is in the disable status, on the other hand,<br>
step S8 is skipped. As a result of repeating the above<br>
operation for each piece of Clip information and AVClip, file<br><br>
management information for each AVClip which is in the enable<br>
status is added to the BD volume management information. The<br>
BD volume management information obtained as a result of this<br>
addition is Virtual Package information. The Virtual Package<br>
information is provided to the application which has called<br>
the Virtual Package and the Playback Control Engine 32 (step<br>
S9). This completes the procedure.<br>
 FIG. 27A is a flowchart showing a procedure when calling<br>
the enableClip method. When this method is called, AVClip<br>
y which is to be set to the enable status is specified from<br>
an argument in the call (step S14), and judgments of steps<br>
S15 and S16 are performed in this order. Step S15 is a judgment<br>
as to whether AVClip y is stored on the Local Storage 18,<br>
and step S16 is a judgment as to whether a file path of AVClip<br>
y is written in the stream storage location information file.<br>
Any of when AVClip y is not stored on the Local Storage 18<br>
and when the file path of AVClip y is not written in the stream<br>
storage location information file, a false response is<br>
returned to the caller, and the procedure ends (step S19).<br>
If AVClip y is stored on the Local Storage 18 and the file<br>
path of AVClip y is written in the stream storage location<br>
information file, AVClip y is set to the enable status . Also,<br>
a file attribute of a file storing AVClip y in the Local Storage<br>
18 is set to Read-Only, to set AVClip y to Read Only Mode<br>
(step S17) . After this, a success response is returned (step<br>
S18) .<br><br>
FIG. 27B is a flowchart showing a procedure when calling<br>
the disableClip method. When this method is called, AVClip<br>
y which is to be set to the disable status is specified from<br>
an argument in the call (step S21), and judgments of steps<br>
S22 and S23 are performed in this order . Step S22 is a judgment<br>
as to whether AVClip y is being played back, and step S23<br>
is a judgment as to whether a file path of AVClip y is not<br>
written in the stream storage location information file . Any<br>
of when AVClip. y is being played back and when the file path<br>
of AVClip y is not written in the stream storage location<br>
information file, a false response is return to the caller,<br>
and the procedure ends (step S26) . If AVClip y is not being<br>
played back and the file path of AVClip y is written in the<br>
stream storage location information file, on the other hand,<br>
AVClip y is set to the disable status. Also, a file attribute<br>
of a file storing AVClip y is set to Re-writable, to cancel<br>
Read Only Mode of AVClip y (step S24) . After this, a success<br>
response is returned (step S25) .<br>
FIG. 28 is a flowchart showing a playback procedure by<br>
the Playback Control Engine' 32. In this flowchart, a loop<br>
of steps S33 to S42 is performed with a beginning piece of<br>
Playltem information in PlayList information being set as<br>
Playltem i. A control variable in the loop of steps S33 to<br>
S42 is variable i. An operation of performing steps S33 to<br>
S42 and then incrementing control variable i is conducted<br>
until variable i exceeds a number of Playltems (Number Of<br>
Playltem) (step S41) .<br><br>
Steps S32 to S40 are described below. An AVClip shown<br>
in a Clip_information_file_name in Playltem information i<br>
is set as AVClip j (step S33) , which is targeted for playback.<br>
Step S34 is a judgment as to whether AVClip j is in the enable<br>
status or not. If AVClip j is not in the enable status, the<br>
procedure is terminated at this point. If AVClip j is in the<br>
enable status, the drive device and the decoder are instructed<br>
to play AVClip j from a Playltem. In^time to a Playltem.Out_time<br>
(step S35) .<br>
Step S36 is a judgment as to whether there exists<br>
SubPlayltem k specifying Playltem information i in<br>
Sync_PlayItem_id. If this SubPlayltem does not exist, the<br>
procedure directly moves to step S41. If the SubPlayltem<br>
exists, the AVClip shown by the Clip_information_file_name<br>
of SubPlayltem k is set as AVClip h (step S38) , and a judgment<br>
is. made as to whether AVClip h is in the enable status (step<br>
S39) . If AVClip h is in the enable status, the drive device<br>
and the decoder are instructed to play AVClip h from a<br>
Sync_Start_PTS_of_PlayItem to Out_time, and then the<br>
procedure, moves to step S41 (step S40) .<br>
If AVClip h is not in the enable status, step S40 is<br>
skipped. A stream sequence, defined by the PlayList<br>
information is played back as a result of this process being<br>
repeated for all of the Playltem information constituting<br>
the PlayList information. FIG. 29 is a flowchart showing a<br><br>
procedure of an application . First, the application requests<br>
download of a stream storage location information file,<br>
PlayList information, Clip information, and AVClips (step<br>
S51) . The application then requests creation of a Virtual<br>
Package (step S52) . Step S53 is a judgment as to whether the<br>
creation request results in a success. The Virtual Package<br>
creation request is repeated until the Virtual Package<br>
creation results in a success.<br>
Once the creation of the Virtual Package has resulted<br>
in a success, step S55 is performed. Step S55 is a judgment<br>
as to whether Virtual Package information contains any Missing<br>
Stream. In detail, if Clip information exists but an AVClip<br>
corresponding to the Clip information does not exist, that<br>
AVClip is acquired as a Missing Stream (step S56) .<br>
After this, a Play method of Progressive PlayList<br>
information is called in step S57, and a judgment is made<br>
as to whether the Play method results in success (step S58).<br>
If the Play method results in false, the procedure ends. If<br>
the Play method, results in success, a loop of steps S59 to<br>
S61 is performed.<br>
StepS59isacallof the getMissingSt reams met hod. Step<br>
S60 is a judgment as to whether, upon notification of a Missing<br>
Stream in response to the call of step S59, download of any<br>
previously acquired Missing Stream has completed.<br>
Step S61 is a judgment as to whether an event showing<br>
completion of playback of an AVClip occurs. The application<br><br>
repeats steps S59 to S61 while the playback is being performed<br>
by the Playback Control Engine 32.<br>
I-f there is an AVClip the download of which has completed<br>
in the above repetition (step S60: YES) , the enableClip method<br>
is called for that Missing Stream, which has been downloaded<br>
(step S62) . This allows the AVClip which has been downloaded<br>
- to be promptly set to the enable status.<br>
If there is any AVClip the playback of which has completed<br>
(step S61: YES), the application judges whether that AVClip<br>
is a trailer or not. If the AVClip is a trailer, the application<br>
calls the disableClip method for the AVClip. This allows a<br>
trailer AVClip which has been played back, to be promptly<br>
set to the disable status.<br><operation><br>
An operation of the playback apparatus when playing back<br>
the PlayList information shown in FIG. 20 is described below.<br>
FIGS. 30 to 33 show the progress of download by the network<br>
management module 37 and the progress of playback by the<br>
Playback Control Engine 32 . The first tier shows the progress<br>
of download by the network management module 37 , and the second<br>
tier shows the progress of playback by the Playback Control<br>
Engine 32. The third tier shows an actual time axis, and the<br>
fourth tier shows method calls by the application.<br>
As shown at the first tier, the download by the network<br>
management module 37 is composed Of download Of the PlayList<br><br>
information shown in FIG. 20, download of Clip information#l<br>
to #4, and download of AVClips#l to.#4.<br>
FIG. 30A: current time = time tO<br>
Time tO is a time at which the download of the PlayList<br>
information and Clip information#l to #4 has completed.<br>
Accordingly, the creation of a Virtual Package becomes<br>
possible. Since the PlayList information in the Virtual<br>
Package references AVClip#l and AVClip#l is in the enable<br>
status, the playback of the stream sequence begins at .tO.<br>
FIG. 30B: current time = time t1<br>
Time t1 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#l<br>
referenced by PlayList#l is still in progress but the download<br>
of AVCLip#2 has completed. Since the download of AVClip#2<br>
has completed, AVClip#2 is no longer in the disable status.<br>
The application can set AVCilp#2 to the enable status by calling<br>
the enableClip method. As a result of the call, Playltem#4<br>
corresponding to AVClip#2 is targeted for playback.<br>
FIG. 31A: current time = time t2<br>
Time t2 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#2<br>
referenced by PlayList#l is still inprogress but the download<br>
of AVCLip#3 has completed. Since the download of AVClip#3<br>
has completed, AVClip#3 is no longer in the disable status.<br>
The application can set AVClip#3 to the enable status by calling<br>
the enableClip method. As a result of the call, Playltem#5<br>
corresponding to AVClip#3 is targeted for playback.<br><br>
[0119]<br>
FIG. 31B: current time = time t3<br>
Time t3 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#2 has<br>
completed. Since the playback of AVClip#2 has completed and<br>
AVClip#2 is a trailer, AVClip#2 referenced by the Playltem<br>
can be subjected to deletion. This being so, the disableClip<br>
method is called for AVClip#2, to make AVClip#2 subjected<br>
to deletion. As a result, the Playback Control Engine 32 can<br>
treat AVClip#2 as nonexistent.<br>
FIG. 32A: current time = time t4<br>
Time t4 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#3<br>
referenced by PlayList#l is still in progress but the download<br>
of AVClip#4 has completed. Since the download of AVClip#4<br>
has completed, AVClip#4 is no longer in the disable status.<br>
The application can set AVClip#4 to the enable status by calling<br>
the enableClip method. As a result of the call, Playltem#6<br>
corresponding to AVClip#4 is targeted for playback.<br>
[0121]<br>
FIG. 32B: current time = time t5<br>
Time t5 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#3 has<br>
completed. Since the playback of AVClip#3 has completed and<br>
AVClip#3 is a trailer, AVClip#3 referenced by Playltem#5 can<br>
be subjected to deletion. Thisbeingso, theapplicationmakes<br>
AVClip#3 subjected to deletion by calling the disableClip<br>
method for AVClip#3 . As a result, the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 can treat AVClip#3 as nonexistent.<br>
[0122]<br><br>
FIG. 33: current time = time t6<br>
Time t6 is a time at which the playback of AVClip#4 has<br>
completed. Since the playback of AVClip#4 has completed and<br>
AVClip#4 is a trailer, AVClip#4 referenced by Playltem#6 can<br>
be subjected to deletion. Thisbeingso, the application makes<br>
AVClip#4 subjected to deletion by calling the disableClip<br>
method for AVClip#4 . As a result, the Playback Control Engine<br>
32 can treat AVClip#4 as nonexistent.<br><br>
According to this embodiment, the downloadby the network<br>
management module 37 and the playback by the Playback Control<br>
Engine 32 are performed in parallel, and a downloaded AVClip<br>
is changed from the disable status to the enable status to<br>
have the AVClip played by the Playback Control Engine 32.<br>
This makes it possible to realize "follow-up playback" of<br>
proceeding playback so as to follow the progress of download.<br><br>
Also, any of the downloadeddigitalstreams, theplayback<br>
of which has completed, is changed from the enable status<br>
to the disable status, to have the played digital stream dele ted.<br>
This makes it possible to realize "follow-up deletion" of<br>
proceeding the deletion so as to follow the progress of<br>
playback.<br>
Thus, "follow-up playback" of proceeding playback so<br>
as to follow the progress of download and "follow-up deletion"<br>
of proceeding deletion so as to follow the progress of playback<br>
become possible. Therefore, even in the case where a'<br>
communication rate Of a communication line connecting the<br><br>
playback apparatus is low and a capacity of the Local Storage<br>
18 internal to the playback apparatus is small, a digital<br>
stream recorded on the BD-ROM and a digital stream downloaded<br>
on the Local Storage 18 can be successively played back as<br>
one stream sequence.<br>
Though the present invention has been described by way<br>
of the above embodiment, the present invention is not limited<br>
to such. The present invention can be realized with any of<br>
the following modifications. The. invention of each of the<br>
claims of this application includes extension and<br>
generalization of the above embodiment and its modifications<br>
below. The degree of extension and generalization depends<br>
upon the state of the art in the technical field of the.present<br>
invention at the time when this application was filed.<br>
(A) The embodiment does not mention specific data<br>
structures of directory management information and file<br>
management information in the description of the Virtual<br>
FileSystem unit 38 . However, in the case where the filesystem<br>
in the BD-ROM is prescribed by ISO/IEC 13346, the directory<br>
management information may be constituted by a "directory<br>
file" and a "file entry". The directory file is made up of<br>
a file descriptor showing a directory name of a subordinate<br>
directory and a file descriptor showing a file name of a<br>
subordinate file. The file entry is made up of a descriptor<br>
tag, an ICB tag, an allocation descriptor length, an extension<br>
attribute, and an allocation descriptor.<br><br>
The file management information may be composed of file<br>
entries. The allocation descriptor shows a storage location<br>
of each extent constituting a file.<br>
In this case, Virtual Package information is generated<br>
by adding a file descriptor of a file name of an AVClip on<br>
the Local Storage to a directory file corresponding to the<br>
STREAM directory in the volume management information of the<br>
BD-ROM, and adding a file entry of the AVClip on the Local<br>
Storage to under the STREAM directory in the volume management<br>
information of the BD-ROM.<br>
(B)	The embodiment describes the case where the BD-ROM<br>
is used as a recording medium. However, the present invention<br>
is applicable to any recording medium that is capable of<br>
recording an AVClip and PlayList information. Examples of<br>
such a recording medium include: an optical disc such as a<br>
DVD-ROM, a DVD-RAM, a DVD-RW, a DVD-R, a DVD+RW, a DVD+R,<br>
a CD-R, or a CD-RW; a magneto-optical disk such as a PD or<br>
an MO; a semiconductor memory card such as a CompactFlash<br>
(TM) card, a SmartMedia card, a Memory Stick card, a<br>
MultiMediaCard, or a PCMCIA card; a magnetic disk such as<br>
a flexible disk, SuperDisk, Zip, or Clik!; a removable hard<br>
diskdrivesuch as ORB, Jaz, SparQ, SyJet, EZFley, orMicrodrive,<br>
and a hard disk drive internal to an apparatus.<br><br>
(C)	The embodiment describes the case where the playback<br>
apparatus decodes an AVClip recorded on the BD-ROM and outputs<br><br>
the decoded AVClip to the television. As an alternative, the<br>
playback apparatus may be equipped with only a BD-ROM drive,<br>
with the remaining construction elements being provided in<br>
the television. In this case-, the playback apparatus and the<br>
television can be incorporated in a home network connected<br>
with an IEEE 1394 connector. The embodiment describes the<br>
case where the playback apparatus is connected to the<br>
television, but the playback apparatus may instead be<br>
integrated with a display device. Also, the playback<br>
apparatus may include only an element which constitutes an<br>
essential part of processing. Each of these forms of playback<br>
apparatus is an invention described in this specification.<br>
Accordingly, regardless of the form of the playback apparatus,<br>
an act of manufacturing a playback apparatus based on the<br>
internal structure of the playback apparatus described in<br>
the embodiment is an act of working of the present invention.<br>
Also, any act of assigning with charge (i.e. for sale) or<br>
without charge (i.e. as a gift), leasing, and importing the<br>
playback apparatus isanactof working of the present invention.<br>
Likewise, an act of offering for assignment or lease of the<br>
playback apparatus using storefront displays, catalogs, or<br>
brochures is an act of working of the present invention.<br>
(D) Information processing using programs shown in the<br>
flowcharts is actually realized using hardware resources.<br>
Accordingly, the programs which describe the operational<br>
procedures shown in the flowcharts are themselves an invention.<br>
The embodiment describes the case where the programs are<br><br>
incorporated in the playback apparatus, but the programs can<br>
be implemented independently of the playback apparatus . Acts<br>
of working of the programs include (1) an act of manufacturing,<br>
(2) an act of assigning with or without charge, (3) an act<br>
of leasing, (4) an act of importing, (5) an act of providing<br>
to the public via a bi-directional electronic communications<br>
network, and (6) an act of offering for assignment or lease<br>
using storefront displays, catalogs, or brochures.<br><br>
(E)	The time elements of the steps which are' executed<br>
in a time series in each of the flowcharts can be regarded<br>
as the necessary elements of the present invention . - Thisbeing<br>
so, a playback method shown by these flowcharts is an invention .<br>
If -the processing shown in each flowchart is carried out by<br>
performing the steps in a time series so as to achieve the<br>
intended aim and the intended effect, this is an act of working<br>
of the recording method of the present invention.<br>
(F)	The embodiment describes the case where an AVClip<br>
is used as a digital stream recorded on the recording medium,<br>
but the present invention can also be realized with a VOB<br>
(Video Object) of the DVD-Video Format or the DVD-Video<br>
Recording Format. The VOB is a program stream that complies<br>
with the ISO/IEC 13818-1-standard and is obtained by<br>
multiplexing a video stream and an audio stream. Also, the<br>
video stream in the AV Clip may be an MPEG4 video stream or<br>
a WMV video stream. Further, the audio stream in the AV Clip<br>
may be a Linear PCM audio stream, a Dolby AC-3 audio stream,<br><br>
an MP3 audio stream, an MPEG-AAC audio stream, a dts audio<br>
stream, or a WMA (Windows (TM) media audio) audio stream.<br>
(G) The movie work described in the embodiment may be<br>
obtained by encoding an analog video signal broadcast by analog<br>
broadcasting. Also, the movie work may be stream data _<br>
constituted by a transport stream broadcast by digital<br>
broadcasting.<br>
Alternatively, an analog/digital video signal recorded<br>
on a videotape may be encoded to obtain content. Also, an<br>
analog/digital video signal directly captured by a video<br>
camera may be encoded to obtain content. A digital work<br>
distributed by a distribution server is applicable too.<br>
(H) The BD-J module 29b may be a Java (TM) platform that<br>
is embedded in an apparatus for receiving satellite broadcasts .<br>
When the BD-J module 29b is such a Java (TM) platform, •the<br>
playback apparatus according to the present invention also<br>
performs processes as an STB for MHP.<br>
Further, the BD-J module 29b may be a Java (TM) platform<br>
that is embedded in an apparatus for performing process control<br>
of a mobile phone. When the BD-J module 29b is such a Java<br>
(TM) platform, the playback apparatus according to the present<br>
invention also performs processes as a mobile phone.<br>
(I) In a layer model, the HDMV mode may be positioned<br>
on the BD-J mode. Especially the analysis of the dynamic<br>
scenario in the HDMV mode and the execution of the control<br><br>
procedure based on the dynamic scenario put light load on<br>
the playback apparatus. Accordingly, there is no problem in<br>
executing the HDMV mode on the BD-J mode. Also, in the<br>
development of a playback apparatus or amovie work., operations<br>
can be guaranteed by only one mode.<br>
Further, the playback process may be executed only in<br>
the BD-J mode. This is because playback controls can be<br>
performed in sync with playback of a PL in the BD-J mode,<br>
and therefore the HDMV mode, may be omitted. <br>
(J) An AVClip downloaded onto the Local Storage 18 may<br>
be bonus video or an interview of a producer or an actor.<br>
(K) The embodiment describes the case where an<br>
application calls the getMissingStream method to check<br>
whether a Clip is a Missing Stream or Rewritable. Instead,<br>
Java (TM) libraries such as Java (TM) .'net and Java (TM) . io<br>
maybe used. Insuchacase, it is practical to use the following<br>
methods a), b), and c).<br>
a) Analyze the contents of a Binding Unit Manifest File<br>
(stream location storage information) using XML Parser.<br>
(Example of the Binding Unit Manifest File)<br><progressive><br><progressiveasset vpfilename="BDMV/'STREAM/'01000 .m2ts"><br><budafile name=" 1/1/streams/0 .m2ts" x><br><br></budafile></progressiveasset><br><progressiveasset vpfilename="BDMV/STREAM/01 001 .m2ts"><br><budafile name .m2ts><br></budafile></progressiveasset><br><progressiveasset vpfilename="BDMV/STREAM/01002.m2ts"><br><budafile name="1/1/streams/2.m2ts" x><br></budafile></progressiveasset><br></progressive><br>
Note that "BUDA" is an abbreviation of a Binding Unit<br>
Data Area which is an area in a Local Storage for storing<br>
files used for a Virtual Package.<br>
b)	Check whether xxxxx .m2ts exists in a file path (stream<br>
storage location) described in a Binding Unit Manifest File<br>
using Java (TM).io.<br>
[0138]<br>
(Example)<br>
new Java (TM) . io. File ("1/1/'streams/0 .m2ts"). exists () ;<br>
// Missing Stream when false<br>
c)	Check whether a size of a file on a server matches<br>
a size of a file on a Local Storage using Java (TM) .net, Java<br>
(TM).io, to judge completion of download.<br>
[0139]<br>
(Example)<br><br>
new java (TM).net.URL(http://xxx.com/vp_data/<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
The playback apparatus according to the present<br>
invention may be used personally as in a home theater system.<br>
However, the playback apparatus according to the present<br>
invention may also be used industrially since the internal<br>
structure thereof is disclosed in the above embodiment and<br>
it is apparent that the playback apparatus according to the<br>
present invention will be manufactured in volume. For this<br>
reason, the playback apparatus according to the present<br>
invention has industrial applicability.<br><br>
