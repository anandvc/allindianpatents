				<td>This invention generally relates to a conduit guide for supporting a conduit on a frame member of a bicycle. More specifically, the present invention relates conduit guide for supporting a conduit on a frame member in a manner that prevents crushing of the conduit. 2.        Background Information<br>
Bicycling is becoming an increasingly more popular form of recreation as wel! as a means of transportation. iVIoreover, bicycling has become a very popular competitive sport for both amateurs and professionals. Whether the bicycle is used for recreation, transportation or competition, the bicycle industry is constantly improving the various components of the bicycle as well as the frame of the bicycle.<br>
These constantly improvements in bicycle components have resulted in new bicycle components and/or frames that are not compatible with older components and/or frames. The frame of the bicycle has been extensively redesigned. In fact, each bicycle manufacturer may have several different frame designs. Accordingly, all bicycle components can not work on all bicycle frames. Moreover, the newer components often have special cabling requirements. This requires either the bicycle component manufacturers to produce different bicycle components for different frame designs or the frame manufacturers to produce new frames that work with the newer components. For example, most bicycle frames have conduit guides (cable housing stoppers) that are welded on the frame tubes at various locations for guiding brake cables and shift cables from an operating device to a component of the bicycle, e.g., a ' brake or a derailleur. Depending upon the placement of these conduit guides, a particular brake or derailleur may not be able to be used with that particular frame.<br>
In other words, one problem with welded conduit guides is that they require the cable to be directed along a particular path of the frame tubes. However, depending upon the bicycle component, the particular cable path provided by the welded conduit guides may not necessarily be suitable for certain configurations of bicycle components. Moreover, such welded conduit guides t\'pical!y cannot be<br><br>
utilized with other types of conduits that transport a fluid. Also, welded conduit guides increase the overall cost of manufacturing the bicycle frame.<br>
Instead of using fixed conduit guides, it is also known to use various types of straps or plastic ties to retain conduits, such as cables or tubes, onto tlie bicycle frame. However, these prior art clamps suffer from various problems. For example, if a regular plastic tie is utilized, the cable or tube is squeezed against the frame tube. In the case of a wire cable, the outer casing housing of the cable is squeezed against the inner wire. In the case of a pneumatic or hydraulic tube, a plastic tie will restrict the flow of fluid through the tube. Accordingly,^ieyGie.i:lamps have been manufactured such as the one disclosed by U,.S. Patent No. 3,S93,647jhat do not exert substantial radial compressive forces on the conduit. However, these types of cable clamps typically do not provide sufficient clamping force to prevent longitudinal movement of the clamp along the frame member.<br>
Another type of cable guide is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,733,835, which also does not exert an excessive radial compressive force on the cable. However, with this type of cable guide, a special frame is required. Moreover, the cable guide is fixed at a particular location and cannot be placed at any desired location along the frame tube. Thus, this type of cable guide may limit the types of components that can be used with a particular frame.<br>
In view of the above, there exists a need for a conduit guide for supporting a conduit on a frame member of a bicycle which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as weli as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring initially to Figure 1, a bicycle 10 is illustrated with conduit guides 12 coupled thereto in accordance with the present invention. Bicycle 10 is preferably a conventional bicycle with a bicycle frame 14. Bicycle 10 and its various components are well known in the art, and thus, bicycle 10 and its various components will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein except for as needed to explain the present invention.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2-4, conduit guide 12 basically includes a strap 16 and a retainer 18 coupled to bicycle frame 24 by strap 16. In this embodiment, .. fionduit guide 12 supports a single conduit or cable 20 that has an outer cable housing 22 and an inner wire 24. Strap 16 holds the retainer 18 against the hjbular portion of frame 14 without exerting any substantia! radial compressive force on cable 20. In other words, substantially no radially compressive force is applied on outer cable housins 22 that would restrict the loneJtudinal movement of inner wire 24 within outer cable housing 22.<br>
In this embodiment, strap 16 is an adjustable strap that can be utilized with a range of diameters of frame tubings. More specifically, strap 16 is preferably aplastic<br><br>
tie-t\-pe of strap that is adjustable. Plastic tie-type straps as illustrated in the drawings are well known in the art. Therefore, strap 16 will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein. Basically, strap 16 has a first end portion 30, an intermediate portion 32 and a second end portion 34. First end portion 30 and second end portion 34 have complimentary tightening structures that are well known in the art. More specifically, first end portion 30 is provided with a slot that has a resilient protrusion located therein, while second end portion 34 has a plurality of transverse ribs or teeth that selectively engage the protrusion of the first end portion 30. Strap 16 is preferably constructed as a one-piece, unitary member that is molded from a resilient plastic material. Any conventional plastic material known to .those skiiled in the art may be used.<br>
As best seen in Figures 2-4, retainer 18 basically includes a foot portion 40 and a conduit retaining portion 42. Retainer 18 can located anywhere along the length of intermediate portion 32 of strap 16.

Strap 16 holds the retainer 318 against the tubular portion of frame 14 without exerting any substantial radial compressive force on conduits 320. In other<br><br>
words, substantiaJJy no radially compressive force is applied on conduits 320 that would restrict the flow of air or fluid therethrough.<br>
Retainer 318 basically includes a foot portion 340 and a conduit retaining portion 342. Foot portion 340 engages the curved surface of frame 14, while conduit retaining portion 342 holds conduits 320 at a particular location on the aibular portion of frame 14. Preferably, retainer 318 is constructed as a one-piece, unitary member. Preferably, retainer 318 is also constructed of a lightweight material such as plastic, Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that other types of materials can be utilized to carry out the present invention.<br>
Foot portion 340 is preferably formed by first and second foot sections 344 that are spaced apart from each other by approximately twice the diameter of one of the conduits 320. Foot sections 344 each have a curved contact surface 346 that is adapted to engage the outer surface of the tube of frame 14.<br>
Conduit retaining portion 342 is preferably U-shaped. In the preferred embodiments, conduit retaining portion 342 is formed by a pair of U-shaped members that are spaced apart from each other. Each of the U-shaped members has a bight section 350 with a pair of parallel leg sections 352 extending therefrom. Abridge 345 connects !eg sections 352 together for added strength. Leg sections 352 are integrally formed with foot sections 344 and bridge 345. The curved inner surfaces formed by conduit retaining portion 342 define a conduit retaining opening 354 for receiving conduits 320 therein. Preferably, conduit retaining opening 354 is sized to receive conduits 320 therein without exerting any substantial radial compressive force thereon.<br>
A strap receiving opening 356 is formed by the bridge 345, the foot sections . S44, and the U-shaped members of the conduit retaining portion 342. Preferably, the width of the strap receiving opening 352 is slightly larger than the width of strap 16 for receiving the intermediate portion 32 of strap 16 therein. When strap 16 is received in strap receiving opening 356, the strap 16 is located between bridge 345 and foot sections 344, and engages the top or outer surfaces of foot sections 344, In other words, strap 16 applies a radially directed force on each of the foot sections 344 to hold retainer 318 against frame 14. Accordingly, conduits 320 are located benveen<br><br>
strap 16 and cable retaining portion 340 so that the clamping force of strap 16 does not exert any substantial pressure on the conduits 320.<br>
Conduit guide 312 is installed on the tubular member of frame M, by first inserting strap 16 into the strap receiving opening 356 of retainer 318. Now, the strap 16 can be installed onto the tubular member of frame 14. The end portions 30 and 34 of strap 16 are connected together by their complimentary tightening structure so as to provide a tight clamping force around the frame tube of frame 14. Because the strap 16 is adjustable, conduit guide 312 can be mounted on avariety of sizes and shapes of tubes or frame members. Moreover, a strong clamping force can be applied to the tube or frame member of frame 14 without applying a compressive force to the conduits 320. The conduits 320 can then be inserted through the conduit retaining opening 354. Alternatively, conduits 320 can be inserted into conduit retaining opening 354 prior to strap 16 being installed around the firame tube or member of frame 14.<br>
As seen in Figure 17, retainer 318 can also be used with strap 16' in the same manner as the prior embodiment. Strap 16' is designed to be used with a specific size of a frame member or tube of fi-ame 14.<br>
