				<td>Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention relates to an oil separator for use in a compressor for separating oil from refrigerant and more particularly, the separation of oil from refrigerant at the discharge end of a screw compressor.<br><br>
Backnround of the Invention<br><br>
[0002j Screw or helical compressors are commonly used in air conditioning applications to compress refrigerant as part of the refrigeration cycle. Screw compressors are composed of meshing screw or helical rotors. While two rotor configurations are the most common design, screw compressors are also known in the art having three, or more, rotors housed in respective overlapping bores so as to co-act in pairs. The rotors of a typical screw compressor are mounted in bearings at each end in housing end plates at the inlet and discharge side. Refrigerant is compressed by the screw rotors toward the discharge side and discharged through ports and into a discharge line.<br><br>
[00031 In normal applications, oil becomes entrained in the refrigerant as a result of the need to lubricate the screw compressor bearings and rotors while the refrigerant passes through and is compressed, and accordingly, needs to be removed after discharge before progressing through the rest of the refrigeration or air conditioning cycle. Accordingly, the combined oil and refrigerant mixture is carried through the compression cycle and then discharged into an oil separator where the oil is removed from the refrigerant. From the oil separator, the refrigerant flows to the condenser.<br><br>
100041 Oil separators are generally of two types, vertical or horizontal. Horizontal oil separators are usually cylindrical with an inlet at one end. In a horizontal separator, the combined oil and refrigerant mix enters through the inlet. The mixture is directed against the inner surfaces of the separator so that the oil droplets impinge on the surfaces and collect there. Under the influence of the flow and gravity, the oil tends to collect at a particular portion near the bottom of the separator where it is removed through a drain. Optionally, mesh separators or baffles may be used to increase the impingement surface on which oil collects. The refrigerant then exits from the upper portion of the separator above the oil collection area.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
[00051 It is an object of this invention to provide an improved oil separation device for use with a screw compressor.<br><br>
[00061 It is another object of this invention to provide a simple but effective oil separation device for use in the discharge line of screw compressor<br><br>
[0007] It is yet another object of this invention to provide an oil separation device using the discharge line and gravity as a means for achieving separation.<br><br>
[00081 It is yet another object of the present invention provide an oil separation device with simple and inexpensive design.<br><br>
[0009] These objects, and others as will become apparent hereinafter, are accomplished by the present invention that includes an oil separator for use in a compressor for separating oil from refrigerant. The separator includes a discharge line having an inner surface, a structure in the discharge line forming an inlet and an outlet within the discharge line, wherein the inlet has a wider diameter than the outlet; and a design for preventing oil from exiting the outlet and means for directing the oil out of the discharge line. In one embodiment, the structure is a substantially circularwall, and wherein the design for preventing is the shape of the wall and relative orientation of the wall to the discharge line. In one embodiment, the relative orientation of the wall to the discharge line has a flow direction with a horizontal component of orientation and the wall has a vertical component of orientation relative the horizontal component.<br><br>
The present invention therefore, provides an oil separator for use in a compressor for separating oil from refrigerant, comprising a discharged line having an inner surface, a structure in said discharge line forming an inlet and an outlet within said discharge line, wherein said inlet has a wider diameter than said outlet and means for preventing oil from exiting said outlet and means for directing said oil out of said discharge line.<br><br><br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
[00101 For a fuller understanding of the present invention, reference should now be made to the following detailed description thereof taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br><br>
10011] FIG. 1 is a simplified schematic view of a screw compressor showing the discharge end and connections to the discharge line;<br><br>
[0012] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the oil separator, showing the oil separation design of the present invention;<br><br>
[00131 FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3-3of FIG. 2, showing the oil flow downward over the separator; and<br>
[00141 FIG. 4 is an alternative embodiment of the oil separator shown in FIG. 2. Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[00151 Referring now to the drawings in detail there is shown in FIG. I a schematic cross-sectional view of a screw compressor. The screw compressor includes a housing 12, intermeshing rotors 14, refrigerant inlet 18 and discharge 20, including a discharge plate 22 and discharge housing 24 that is connected with a discharge line<br>
26.	In operation, assuming one of rotors 14 to be the driving rotor, rotor 14 rotates engaging the other rotor, causing its rotation. The co-action of rotating rotors 14 draws<br><br>
refrigerant gas via suction inlet 18 into the grooves of rotors 14 that engage to trap and compress volumes of gas and deliver hot compressed refrigerant gas to discharge port<br>
20.<br><br>
[0016] The oil separator 28 of the present invention is designed to be located in the discharge tube 26, as shown in FIG. 2. Oil separator 28 includes an oil dam 30, check valve 49, and oil return 48. As compressed gaseous refrigerant is expelled from discharge 20 to discharge tube 26, oil separator 28 functions to remove oil from the refrigerant prior to moving to the condenser.<br><br>
10017] Accordingly, oil separator 28 is preferably circular in shape, having a central opening with an inlet 31, with walls 32 forming the opening and extending on a curvilinear basis axially and radially away from the inlet 31 to the outlet 34. As shown the horizontal axis X of the separator 28 extends in the same direction as refrigerant R flow, shown by the arrows. Wall 32 extends from face 36 of separator 28 to the inner walls of discharge line 26 and the oil separator 28 is secured to the wall via a known method such as welding. As refrigerant vapor flows through discharge line 26, oil 0 attaches to the walls 38 thereof and flows in the direction of the vapor flow. Accordingly, the oil 0 flows along the wall 38 until it reaches dam portion 40 formed between walls 32 and 38, and is thus prevented from further travel via dam 40 while the refrigerant vapor with much oil removed continues to travel through the refrigeration or air-conditioning cycle. On the upper end 42 of separator 28 oil gathers in dam portion 40 and, as shown in FIG. 3 by the arrows, flows over the outer surface of wall 32 and the inner surface of wall 38, down under the force of Gravity G, to lower end 44. Along the lower end 46 of wall 38, oil 0 flows to lower dam portion 41 formed between walls 32 and 38 and accumulates at lower dam portion 41 in the vicinity of an oil return 48 (shown in FIG. 4 by dotted lines). Oil return 48 extends downward, vertically using gravity G to transport the excess oil flowing from the dam 40 of separator 28. Oil is transported via return 48 for reclaim to a sump for use for lubricating the screw bearings and rotors. Optionally, a pressure difference between the separator and the sump may also be used in addition to gravity G or separately<br><br>
from gravity G to transport the oil via return 48. Oil separator 28 optionally includes a check valve 49, as shown in FIG.2, hinged at the upper portion of the outlet 34 to prevent reverse flow of refrigerant back through the compressor when the system is not in operation.<br><br><br>
[00181 Optionally wall 32 could include a lip portion 50, as shown in FIG. 4 for assistance in further retaining oil flow over the exterior of wall 32. Also, it is not a requirement that the dam have an entirely vertical orientation; there should be a vertical component of the separator orientation to achieve flow down and to a return line through the influence of gravity but angular orientation will achieve the required results as necessitated by the system and discharge piping design.<br><br>
[00191 Although preferred embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, other changes will occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore intended that the scope of the present invention is to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
