SPECTACLES	WITH INTERCHANGEABLE TEMPLES<br>
This invention relates to spectacles of the type consisting<br>
of an optical or sunshade front optionally supported by a<br>
frame and comprising two interchangeable temples, each temple<br>
being connected to the front or to the frame by a male part<br>
and an associated joint.<br>
Generally and as in the prior art, the joint pin used in<br>
spectacles temples consists of a screw that connects together<br>
the two parts of a hinge forming the joint.<br>
However, a problem well known to opticians is that this screw<br>
forming the pin of the joint very often becomes loose and has<br>
to be retightened - if the looseness has not resulted in the<br>
loss of the temple concerned.<br>
This problem is aggravated if it is wished to make the<br>
temples easily interchangeable without the user having to<br>
visit a specialist but being able to change the temples<br>
himself.<br>
It is an object of this invention to solve all these problems<br>
and it therefore relates to spectacles of the type consisting<br>
of an optical or sunshade front optionally supported by a<br>
frame and comprising two interchangeable temples, each temple<br>
being connected to the front or to the frame by a male part<br>
and an associated joint, in which spectacles the joint of<br>
each of the temples consists of at least one pin arranged<br>
transversely in a corresponding longitudinal slot formed at<br><br>
one end of a free temple, which pin can be snapped into an<br>
elastically deformable recess formed in a plate projecting<br>
from the male part, the shape and dimensions of which are<br>
approximately the same as those of the slot of the temple, in<br>
such a way that the plate of the male part slides into the<br>
slot of the temple, and also in such a way that the joint pin<br>
guides the temple as it rotates and keeps it in a stable<br>
position when folded, in order to provide a screwless joint<br>
that makes the temples easily interchangeable.<br>
Such spectacles according to the invention bring together a<br>
number of advantages, namely: there are no screws to work<br>
loose; each of the parts of the joint can if desired be<br>
molded in plastic, and so there is no intermediate part; the<br>
temple is fitted and removed by a simple hand action, no tool<br>
being required; and the temples are infinitely<br>
interchangeable, allowing the customer any desired<br>
combination of colors and shapes.<br>
The invention relates additionally to the features which will<br>
be set out in the course of the following description, and<br>
which should be considered in isolation or in any possible<br>
technical combination.<br>
This description, given by way of non-restrictive example,<br>
will explain more clearly how the invention can be carried<br>
out with reference to the attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1  is  a perspective view of a pair of spectacles<br>
consisting of a front surrounded at least partly by a frame,<br>
2<br><br>
with two side temples connected together by a joint in a<br>
first illustrative embodiment of the invention;<br>
figure 2 is a view of details on an enlarged scale of the<br>
joint seen in figure 1;<br>
figure 3 is an enlarged view of a portion of spectacles with<br>
holes in the area of its joint corresponding to one end of<br>
the front, and to one end of a corresponding temple, before<br>
the one is joined to the other;<br>
figure 4  shows the  region of one of the joints  of the<br>
spectacles seen in figure 3, in a position where the temple<br>
is being presented to the male part, before being snapped<br>
into position;<br>
figure 5 shows the region of one of the joints of the<br>
spectacles  seen in  figure 4,  after the temple has been<br>
snapped into position on the male part;<br>
figure 6  is a view of a  joint  in accordance with the<br>
preceding figures,  once the temple has been snapped into<br>
position, the temple being in the open position;<br>
figure 7 is a view of a joint as seen in the preceding<br>
figures, with the temple snapped into position and in the<br>
closed position;<br>
figure 8 is a perspective view of a male part of a joint in<br>
accordance with the invention;<br>
figure 9 is a perspective view of the end of a temple forming<br>
the complementary joint region of the male part seen in<br>
figure 8; and<br>
3<br><br>
figure 10  is  a perspective  view  of  an  assembled  joint<br>
comprising a male part as seen in figure 8 and an end of a<br>
temple as seen in figure 9.<br>
The spectacles, which are given the general reference 1 in<br>
the figures,  consist of an optical or sunshade front 2<br>
optionally  supported  by  a  frame  and  comprising  two<br>
interchangeable temples 3, each temple being connected to the<br>
front 2 or to the frame 16 by a male part 4 and an associated<br>
joint 5.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the joint 5 of each temple<br>
3	consists of at least one pin 6, 6A arranged transversely in<br>
a corresponding longitudinal slot 7, 7A formed at one end of<br>
a free temple 3, which pin 6,  6A can be snapped into an<br>
elastically deformable recess 8, 8A formed in a plate 9, 9A<br>
projecting from the male part 4, the shape and dimensions of<br>
the plates are approximately the same as those of the slot 7<br>
of the temple 3. In this way the plate 9, 9A of the male part<br>
4	slides into the slot 7, 7A of the temple 3, and the joint<br>
pin 6, 6A also guides the temple 3 as it rotates and keeps it<br>
in a stable position when folded,  in order to provide a<br>
screwless joint that makes the arms easily interchangeable.<br>
Of course, the opposite is also true and possible, that is to<br>
say, the slot 7 could very well be formed in the male part 4<br>
and the plates 9 on the temple 3.<br>
For preference, in the present embodiment, the joint 5 of<br>
each of the temples 3 consists of two transverse pins 6, 6A<br>
4<br><br>
are aligned with each other, in two corresponding<br>
longitudinal slots 7, 7A mutually parallel and identical and<br>
formed in the temple 3, which pins 6, 6A snap elastically<br>
into two recesses 5, 5A formed in two mutually parallel and<br>
identical guide plates 9, 9A projecting from the male part 4,<br>
the shape and dimensions of the plates being approximately<br>
the same as those of the two slots 7, 7A of the temple 3 into<br>
which they slide.<br>
Continuing with the present embodiment, used here as an<br>
example, the guide plates 9, 9A of the male part 4 and the<br>
corresponding slots 7, 7A of the temples 3 are rectangular<br>
parallelepipeds whose dimensions, especially their respective<br>
thicknesses "e", "e'", have approximately equal values, with<br>
a manufacturing tolerance such as to obtain a so-called<br>
sliding fit.<br>
As can be seen especially clearly in figures 3 and 4, the<br>
distance "d" between the pin 6, 6A of the temple 3 and the<br>
rear end of its slot 7, 7A, in the direction of the male part<br>
4, is less than the distance "d'" between the recess 8, 8A of<br>
the same male part 4 and a rear part or shoulder 10 of the<br>
latter, when the recess 8, 8A of the male part 4 is presented<br>
to the pin 6, 6A of the temple 3, for their snap engagement,<br>
in such a way that the shoulder 10 of the male part 4 finds a<br>
bearing surface P in the end part of the slot 7, 7A of the<br>
temple 3, so as to exert upon the latter the force F<br>
necessary for their snap engagement and thereafter allow the<br>
5<br><br>
temple and the male part to pivot freely relative to each<br>
other, once in the position of use.<br>
Furthermore,  in the present illustrative embodiment,  the<br>
guide  plates  9,   9A  are  continued  by  a  generally<br>
parallelepiped-shaped block 11,  together forming the male<br>
part 4,  said block 11 being pierced by two holes 12,  13<br>
designed to  receive  two  fixing means  14  for  fixing  it<br>
directly to the optical or sunshade front 2.<br>
This fixing means may take the form of a rivet or a screw.<br>
In an embodiment shown in figures 1 and 2, the guide plates<br>
9,  9A project from a male part 4 produced in the same<br>
plastics molding operation as the frame 16.<br>
The slots 7, 7A of the temples 3, and the joint pins 6, 6A<br>
that extend through them, are advantageously produced in the<br>
same molding operation as said temples 3.<br>
In another feature of the invention,  the recesses 8,  8A<br>
formed in the guide plates 9, 9A of the male part 4 consist<br>
partly of parts of circular section, of approximately the<br>
same diameter as the joint pins 6, 6A of the temple 3 to<br>
which the recesses can be connected, and partly of an open<br>
part bounded by two protrusions  14,  15  separated by a<br>
distance less than the diameter of the pins 6, 6A, so that<br>
the pins 6, 6A are locked when snapped elastically into the<br>
recesses 8, 8A.<br>
The temples 3 and the male parts 4 are advantageously made of<br>
plastic.<br>
6<br><br>
Because of the excellent results obtained, the plastic used<br>
is preferably grilamide, more generally a member of the<br>
polyamide family.<br>
With the invention described above, therefore, production<br>
costs are greatly reduced and at the same time there is<br>
better control of the coefficients of friction of the parts<br>
against each other, these advantages being added to the fact<br>
that the joint requires no screws but allows interchanging of<br>
a broken temple as well as color mixing to combine the colors<br>
for the purpose of personalizing the spectacles and making<br>
them more distinctive.<br>
The invention can therefore be adapted to spectacles with<br>
so-called rimless lenses 2, where the male parts 4 are fixed<br>
directly to the lenses 2, or to spectacles with frames 16,<br>
where the male parts 4 are produced directly with said frame<br>
16 or with the temples 3.<br>
