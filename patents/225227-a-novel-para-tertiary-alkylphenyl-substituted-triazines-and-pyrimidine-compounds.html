				<td>NON-YELLOWING PARA-TERTIARY-ALKYL PHENYL SUBSTITUTED TRIAZINE<br>
AND PYRIMIDINE ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT ABSORBERS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to novel<br>
para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted triazines and<br>
pyrimidines and their use as protectants against degradation<br>
by environmental forces, including ultraviolet light, actinic<br>
radiation, oxygen, moisture, atmospheric pollutants and<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Exposure to sunlight and other sources of<br>
ultraviolet radiation is known to cause degradation of a<br>
variety of materials, especially polymeric materials. For<br>
example, polymeric materials such as plastics often discolor<br>
and may become brittle as a result of exposure to ultraviolet<br>
light. Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed<br>
directed towards materials such as ultraviolet light<br>
absorbers and stabilizers which are capable of inhibiting<br>
such degradation.<br>
A class of materials known to be ultraviolet light<br>
absorbers are o-hydroxyphenyltriazines, in which at least one<br>
substituent on the 1, 3 or 5 carbon on the triazine ring is a<br>
phenyl group with a hydroxyl group ortho to the point of<br>
attachment to the triazine ring. In general this class of<br>
materials is well known in the art. Disclosures of such<br>
compounds can be found in United States Patent No. 3,242,175<br>
and United States Patent No. 3,244,708.<br>
A further example is found in United States Patent<br>
Nos. 3,843,371 and 3,896,125, which disclose various<br>
hydroxyphenyltriazines. These triazines show poor<br>
solubilities and poor stabilities, and can discolor with<br>
time.<br>
Hydroxyphenyltriazines in combination with other UV<br>
absorbers such as hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles, benzophenones,<br>
oxanilides, cyanoacrylates, salicylates, acrylonitriles and<br>
thiozlines, are also well known. For example, United States<br>
Patent Nos. 4,853,471, 4,973,702, 4,921,966 and 4,973,701<br>
disclose such combinations.<br>
Typically, the aforementioned aryl ring with the<br>
hydroxyl group ortho to the point of attachment to the<br>
triazine ring is based on resorcinol and, consequently, this<br>
aryl ring also contains a second substituent (either a<br>
hydroxyl group or a derivative thereof) para- to the point of<br>
attachment to the triazine ring. For example, United states<br>
Patents No. 3,118,837 and 3,244,708 disclose p-alkoxy-o-<br>
hydroxyphenyl triazines with improved UV protection, but such<br>
triazines also exhibit poor solubility and poor long-term<br>
stabilities.<br>
This para- substituent can be "non-reactive," as in<br>
the case of an alkyloxy group, or "reactive" as in the case<br>
of a hydroxyalkyloxy (active hydrogen reactive site) or<br>
(meth)acryloyl (ethylenic unsaturation reactive site) group.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the former are<br>
referred to as "non-bondable" benzocycle-substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines and the latter are referred to as<br>
"bondable" para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines<br>
and triazines.<br>
Many polymer additives (such as ultraviolet light<br>
stabilizers) volatilize or migrate out of the polymer<br>
substrate to be protected, or are adsorbed (chemically or<br>
physically) by one or more systems components (such as<br>
pigments), thereby diminishing their effectiveness. Such<br>
volatilization, migration and adsorption problems are<br>
examples of the general problems of lack of solubility and<br>
compatibility found for many commercial polymer additives.<br>
Bondable triazines are well known in the art. For<br>
example, United States Patent Nos. 3,423,360, 4,962,142 and<br>
5,189,084 disclose various bondable and the incorporation of<br>
these compounds into polymers by chemical bonding. Bondable<br>
stabilizers have a potential advantage in this respect in<br>
that, depending on the bondable functionality and the<br>
particular polymer system to be stabilized, they can be<br>
chemically incorporated into a polymer structure via reaction<br>
of the bondable functionality either during polymer formation<br>
(such as in the case of polymerizing monomers or a<br>
crosslinking polymer system) or subsequently with a preformed<br>
polymer having appropriate reactive functionality. Due to<br>
such bonding, migration of these UV absorbers between layers<br>
of multi-layer coatings and into polymer substrates is<br>
greatly reduced.<br>
Several of the previously incorporated references<br>
disclose tertiary alkylated substituted triazines. For<br>
example United States Patent No. 3,242,175 and United States<br>
Patent No. 3,244,708 disclose mono-tertiary butylated benzene<br>
triazines. There remains a need for new UV-stabilizers which<br>
possess improved compatibility with the polymer systems to<br>
which they are added, as well as impart improved<br>
environmental stability to such systems. The present<br>
invention provides novel para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted triazine and pyrimidine stabilizers which satisfy<br>
this need.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a new class of para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl-substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
depicted below, in which a substituent attached to the<br>
triazine or pyrimidine ring is a bondable or non-bondable<br>
para-tertiary alkyl phenyl group:<br>
wherein Z signifies a resorcinol radical which is bound<br>
through a cyclic carbon atom directly to the triazine ring or<br>
a substituted resorcinol radical, A can be a nitrogen or<br>
optionally substituted methine, and each R signifies a<br>
hydrocarbyl group to form a tertiary carbon attached to the<br>
ring. These para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted triazines<br>
and pyrimidines have the advantage of being highly soluble in<br>
and compatible with many polymers and coatings while being<br>
stable to environmental degradation that has lead previous UV<br>
stabilizers to turn yellow and to degrade with respect to<br>
performance as UV absorbers.<br>
More specifically, the new para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention have general formula (II):<br>

The substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the<br>
present invention may optionally have the added benefit of<br>
being capable of being chemically bonded to appropriate<br>
polymer systems via functionality attached to the<br>
alkylphenyl, pyrimidine and triazine groups (e.g., by a<br>
hydroxyl, ethylenic unsaturated and/or activated unsaturated<br>
group in one or more of R1, R2, Y or Z) .<br>
These para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines may in general be prepared via a<br>
number of procedures well known in the art, for example,<br>
those described in Brunetti, H; Luethi, C.; Helv. Chemica<br>
Acta, 55. (1972) pp. 1566-1595; Tanimoto, S. ; Yamagata, M.<br>

Patent Kokai Tokkyo Koho 9,059,263; and by Friedel-Crafts<br>
reaction starting with a chloro-substituted triazine or<br>
pyrimidine.<br>
The novel para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention are<br>
particularly useful as ultraviolet light absorber agents for<br>
stabilizing a wide variety of materials including, for<br>
example, organic compounds, oils, fats, waxes, cosmetics,<br>
dyes and biocides, and particularly various organic polymers<br>
(both crosslinked and non-crosslinked) used in applications<br>
such as photographic materials, plastics, fibers or dyed<br>
fibers, rubbers, paints and other coatings, and adhesives.<br>
The present invention, consequently, also relates to (1) a<br>
method of stabilizing a material which is subject to<br>
degradation by actinic radiation (e.g., an organic material<br>
such as an organic polymer in the form of a film, fiber,<br>
shaped article or coating) by incorporating into said<br>
material an amount of an actinic radiation stabilizer<br>
composition effective to stabilize the material against the<br>
effects of actinic radiation, wherein the actinic radiation<br>
stabilizer composition comprises the inventive para-tertiary<br>
alkyl phenyl substituted 1,3,5-triazine or pyrimidine; and<br>
(2) the material so stabilized.<br>
The novel para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention are also<br>
effective as ultraviolet light screening agents in<br>
applications such as sunscreens and other cosmetic<br>
preparations, capstock layers for extruded polymers, dyed<br>
fibers and laminated UV-screening window films, among others.<br>
The present invention, consequently, also relates (1) to a<br>
method of protecting a substrate against degradation by<br>
actinic radiation by applying to the substrate an actinic<br>
radiation screening layer (e.g., a coating film or capstock<br>
layer) containing an actinic radiation screening composition<br>
in an amount effective to reduce the amount of actinic<br>
radiation impinging on the substrate, wherein the actinic<br>
radiation screening composition comprises the inventive<br>
para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and<br>
triazines; and (2) the substrate so protected.<br>
The novel para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention may also<br>
be employed to form light stabilizing compositions. Such<br>
light stabilizing compositions may include a variety of other<br>
components known in the art including other ultraviolet light<br>
absorbers of the triazine class, other ultraviolet light<br>
absorbers of different classes (e.g. benzotriazoles,<br>
benzophenones), hindered amine light stabilizers, radical<br>
scavengers, antioxidants and the like.<br>
These and other features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will be more readily understood by those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following<br>
detailed description.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and<br>
triazines<br>
As used herein, the term "para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines" broadly refers<br>
to any compound of formulas (I) through (V), above.<br>
As used herein, the term "para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl" broadly refers to any compound or substituent of<br>
general formula:<br><br>
wherein substituent R is as above for general formulas (I)-<br>
(V) ;<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" in the context of the<br>
present invention, and in the above formulas, broadly refers<br>
to a monovalent hydrocarbon group in which the valency is<br>
derived by abstraction of a hydrogen from a carbon atom.<br>
Hydrocarbyl includes, for example, aliphatics (straight and<br>
branched chain), cycloaliphatics, aromatics and mixed<br>
character groups (e.g., aralkyl and alkaryl). Hydrocarbyl<br>
also includes such groups with internal unsaturation and<br>
activated unsaturation. More specifically, hydrocarbyl<br>
includes (but is not limited to) such groups as alkyl,<br>
cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl and<br>
alkynyl, preferably having up to 24 carbon atoms. A<br>
hydrocarbyl may optionally contain a carbonyl group or groups<br>
(which is/are included in the carbon count) and/or a<br>
heteroatom or heteroatoms (such as at least one oxygen,<br>
sulfur, nitrogen or silicon), in the chain or ring.<br>
The term "functional hydrocarbyl" in the context of<br>
the present invention, and in the above formulas, broadly<br>
refers to a hydrocarbyl possessing pendant and/or terminal<br>
reactive and/or latent reactive functionality and/or leaving<br>
groups. "Reactive" functionality refers to functionality<br>
which is reactive with common monomer/polymer functionality<br>
under normal conditions well understood by those persons of<br>
ordinary skill in the relevant art. As non-limiting examples<br>
of reactive functionality may be mentioned active hydrogen<br>
containing groups such as hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, thio,<br>
amido, carbamoyl and activated methylene; isocyanato; cyano;<br>
epoxy; ethylenically unsaturated groups such as allyl and<br>
methallyl; and activated unsaturated groups such acryloyl and<br>
methacryloyl, and maleate and maleimido (including the<br>
Diels-Alder adducts thereof with dienes such as butadiene).<br>
"Latent reactive" functionality within the meaning of the<br>
present invention and, as would clearly be understood by<br>
those persons of ordinary skill in the art, refers to<br>
reactive functionality which is blocked or masked to prevent<br>
premature reaction. As examples of latent reactive<br>
functionality may be mentioned ketimines and aldimines<br>
(amines blocked, respectively, with ketones and aldehydes);<br>
amine-carboxylate salts; and blocked isocyanates such as<br>
alcohol (carbamates), oxime and caprolactam blocked<br>
variations. A "leaving" group within the meaning of the<br>
present invention, as would clearly be understood by those<br>
persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art, is a<br>
substituent attached to the hydrocarbyl chain or ring which<br>
during reaction is dislodged or displaced to create a valency<br>
on a carbon or hetero atom in the hydrocarbyl chain or ring,<br>
said valency being filled by a nucleophile. As examples of<br>
leaving groups may be mentioned halogen atoms such as<br>
chlorine, bromine and iodine; hydroxyl groups (protonated and<br>
unprotonated); quaternary ammonium salts (NT/); sulfonium<br>
salts (ST3+) ; and sulfonates (—OSO3T) ; where T is, e.g.,<br>
methyl or para-tolyl. Of all these classes of reactive<br>
functionality, the preferred functionality includes hydroxyl,<br>
-COOR5, — CR6=CH2, —CO—CR6=CH2, Cl, an isocyanate group, a<br>
blocked isocyanate group and -NHR5, wherein<br>
R5 is selected from hydrogen and a hydrocarbyl<br>
(preferably of up to 24 carbon atoms); and<br>
R6 is selected from hydrogen and an alkyl of 1 to 4<br>
carbon atoms (preferably hydrogen and methyl).<br>
The term "hydrocarbylene" in the context of the<br>
present invention is a divalent hydrocarbon group in which<br>
both valencies derive by abstraction of hydrogens from carbon<br>
atoms. Included within the definition of hydrocarbylene are<br>
the same groups as indicated above for hydrocarbyl and<br>
functional hydrocarbyl with, of course, the extra valency<br>
(for example, alkylene, alkenylene, arylene, alkylaryl,<br>
etc. ) .<br>
The term "functional hydrocarbylene" in the context<br>
of the present invention refers to a species of<br>
hydrocarbylene possessing pendant reactive functionality,<br>
latent reactive functionality and/or leaving groups. The<br>
term "non-functional hydrocarbylene" in the context of the<br>
present invention refers generally to a hydrocarbylene other<br>
than a functional hydrocarbylene.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines in accordance with the present<br>
invention also relate to latent stabilizing compounds against<br>
actinic radiation of the general formulas (I) - (V), wherein<br>
at least one of the hydroxyl groups on the aryl ring ortho to<br>
the point of attachment to the triazine or pyrimidine ring is<br>
blocked, that is, wherein at least one X is other than<br>
hydrogen. Such latent stabilizing compounds liberate the<br>
effective stabilizers by cleavage of the O—X bond, e.g., by<br>
heating or by exposure to UV radiation. Latent stabilizing<br>
compounds are desirable because they have many favorable<br>
properties, i.e., good substrate compatibility, good color<br>
properties, a high cleavage rate of the O—X bond and a long<br>
shelf life. The use of latent stabilizing compounds is<br>
further described in United States Patent Nos. 4,775,707,<br>
5,030,731, 5,563,224 and 5,597,854, which are incorporated<br>
herein for all purposes as if fully set forth.<br>
Latent stabilizing compounds comprising the para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
in accordance with the present invention can be prepared from<br>
compounds of the general formulas (I) - (V), wherein at least<br>
one X is hydrogen, by subjecting said compounds to a further<br>
reaction to form latent stabilizing compounds, as described<br>
in the immediately preceding incorporated references.<br>
As preferred examples of blocking groups X may be<br>
mentioned one or more of the following groups: allyl, -CORa,<br>
-SO2Rb, -SiRcRdRe, -PRfRg or -PORfRg, -CONHRh<br>

each Ra is independently selected from C1—C8 alkyl,<br>
halogen-substituted C1—C8 alkyl, C5—C12 cycloalkyl,<br>
C2—C8 alkenyl, —CH2—CO—CH3, C1—C12 alkoxy, and phenyl<br>

and<br>
each Rh is independently selected from C1—C8 alkyl, C5—C12<br>
cycloalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, -CH2-CO-CH3, and phenyl<br>
which is unsubstituted or substituted by Cl—C12<br>
alkyl, C2-C8 alkonyl, C1-C4 alkoxy, halogen and/or<br>
benzyl.<br>
The reaction to give the latent stabilizing<br>
compounds of the present invention of the general formula (I)<br>
and (II), in which X is allyl, -CORa, -SO2Rb, -SiRcRdRe, -PRfRg<br>
or —PORfRg, can be carried out, for example, by reaction of<br>
the compounds of the general formula (III) through (V),<br>
wherein at least one X is hydrogen with the corresponding<br>
halides such as allyl chloride, Cl—CORa,<br>
Cl-SO2Rb, Cl-SiRcRdRe, Cl-PRfRg, or Cl-PORfRg. The reaction to<br>
give the latent stabilizing compounds of the present<br>
invention of the general formulas (III) through (V) in which<br>
X is —CONHRh can be carried out, for example, by reaction of<br>
the compounds of the general formulas (III) through (V),<br>
wherein at least one X is hydrogen with the corresponding<br>
isocyanates. Furthermore, acylated compounds can be obtained<br>
by reaction with anhydrides, ketenes or esters, such as lower<br>
alkyl esters, as is well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
The above-described reagents may be used in approximately<br>
equimolar amounts or in excess, for example, from 2 to 20 mol<br>
with respect to the hydroxyl groups desired to be made latent<br>
in the starting compound of the general formula (I) or (II).<br>
Catalysts customarily used for acylation,<br>
sulfonylation, phosphonylation, silylation or urethanation<br>
reactions may be used in forming the latent stabilizing<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention. For example, acylation and sulfonylation reaction<br>
catalysts such as tertiary or quaternary amines, such as<br>
triethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine or tetrabutylammonium<br>
salts, may be used for forming these latent stabilizing<br>
compounds.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in the presence of<br>
a solvent, such as relatively inert organics, e.g.,<br>
hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride or chloroform, or<br>
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dibutyl ether, or without a<br>
solvent. Alternatively, the reagent(s) may be employed as<br>
the solvent. The reaction temperature is usually between<br>
room temperature and about 150°C, for example, up to the<br>
boiling point of the solvent when a solvent is used.<br>

Methods of Preparation<br>
The novel alkyated para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention can be prepared through the Friedel-Crafts reaction<br>
of an aromatic moiety (XXX) with a halogen-substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine compound of Formula (XXXI).<br>
The term "Lewis acid" is intended to include<br>
aluminum halides, alkylaluminum halides, boron halides, tin<br>
halides, titanium halides, lead halides, zinc halides, iron<br>
halides, gallium halides, arsenic halide, copper halides,<br>
cadmium halides, mercury halides, antimony halides, and the<br>
like. Preferred Lewis acids include aluminum trichloride,<br>
aluminum tribromide, trimethylaluminum, boron trifluoride,<br>
boron trichloride, zinc dichloride, titanium tetrachloride,<br>
tin dichloride, tin tetrachloride, or a mixture thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "step-wise" means a<br>
reaction sequence wherein a series of reactions are<br>
conducted, the first reaction producing compounds of Formula<br>
(XXXII)and being carried out to between about 50% to about<br>
100% completion prior to addition of a compound of Formula<br>
(XXXIII) to produce compounds of Formula (II). Preferably<br>
the reaction is carried out to between about 70% to about<br>
100% completion prior to addition of compound of Formula<br>
(XXXIII), and more preferably to between about 75% to about<br>
100% completion.<br>
The novel alkyated para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention can be prepared through the Friedel-Crafts reaction<br>
of an aromatic moiety (XXX) with a halogen-substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine compound of Formula (XXXI). See<br>
Scheme 1.<br><br>
wherein Hal is bromine, chlorine, or iodine. Compound (XXX)<br>
is defined as a benzene molecule wherein one hydrogen is<br>
substituted with a tertiary alkyl group, and tertiary alkyl<br>
group is as defined above. In compound (XXXI) Hal, is a<br>
halogen, preferably bromine, chlorine, or iodine, and A is as<br>
defined above. In compound (XXXIII) L, X, R3, and R4 are as<br>
defined above. Substitution of either L or X, or both for an<br>
alkyl group or hydroxy blocking group can be conducted before<br>
or after the second step. One of ordinary skill in the art<br>
with little or no experimentation can easily determine the<br>
conditions to substitute either L or X, or both.<br>
The relative amounts of the reactants are as<br>
follows. The amount of compounds of Formula (XXXI) should be<br>
in sufficient amounts to react with aromatic compounds of<br>
Formula (XXX) to produce compounds of Formula (XXXII). The<br>
amount of aromatic compound of Formula (XXX) is important to<br>
ensure that a sufficient amount of aromatic compounds of<br>
Formula (XXXII) is synthesized without excessive amounts of<br>
undesired side products such as trisaryl triazine or trisaryl<br>
pyrimidine. Moreover, excess amounts of aromatic compounds<br>
can lead to undesired product distributions enriched in mono-<br>
and tris-aryl triazines, or mono- and tris-aryl pyrimidines<br>
thus, making product separation and purification difficult<br>
and resource consuming.<br>
The amount of aromatic compounds (XXX) should be in<br>
sufficient amounts to synthesize<br>
2-halo-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine or<br>
2-halo-4,6-bisarylpyrimidine. Preferably, there should be<br>
between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents of aromatic<br>
compound of Formula (XXX) to compound of Formula (XXXI). The<br>
amount of aromatic compound of Formula (XXXIII) should be<br>
between about 0.5 to about 2.5 mol equivalents of aromatic<br>
compound of Formula (XXXIII) to compounds of Formula (XXXII).<br>
The amount of Lewis acid, Al(Hal)3 wherein Hal is a<br>
halide as defined above, used in the reaction should be in<br>
sufficient amounts to transform 2,4,6-trihalo-1,3,5-triazine<br>
or 2,4,6-trihalo-pyrimidine to the preferred<br>
2-halo-4,6-bisaryl-1,3,5-triazine or<br>
2-halo-4,6-bisarylpyrimidine, respectively. The amount of<br>
Lewis acid should be between about 0.5 to about 500 mol<br>
equivalents. Preferably, the amount of Lewis acid should be<br>
between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents.<br>
The reaction should run for a sufficient amount of<br>
time, at a sufficient temperature and pressure to synthesize<br>
the desired triazine or pyrimidine compound. The preferred<br>
reaction time for the synthesis of compounds of Formula<br>
(XXXII), i.e., the first step,, is between about 5 minutes and<br>
about 48 hours, more preferred between about 15 minutes and<br>
about 24 hours. The preferred reaction time for the<br>
synthesis of compounds of Formula (II), i.e., the second<br>
step, is between about 10 minutes and about 24 hours, more<br>
preferably time is between about 30 minutes and about 12<br>
hours. The reaction pressure is not critical and can be<br>
about 1 atm or higher if desired. Preferably, the reaction<br>
is carried out under an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art with little or no<br>
experimentation can determine the optimum temperature to<br>
obtain the desired product.<br>
The step-wise process comprises mixing at least one<br>
Lewis acid, and compounds of Formula (XXXI) with one or more<br>
of the desired aromatic compounds of Formula (XXX),<br>
preferably until the reaction is between about 70% to about<br>
100% completed. Thereafter, the product is isolated and<br>
purified. The aromatic compound of Formula (XXXIII) is added<br>
to the purified product along with Lewis acid to synthesize<br>
the compounds of Formula (II) . The step-wise sequence allows<br>
for the isolation, purification, and storage of compounds of<br>
Formula (XXXII) prior to subsequent reaction with aromatic<br>
compounds of Formula (XXXIII).<br>
To synthesize compounds of Formula (II) the<br>
preferred addition time of the aromatic compound of Formula<br>
(XXXIII) to the reaction mixture is between about 5 minutes<br>
to about 10 hours, more preferred addition time is between<br>
about 10 minutes to about 5 hours, and most preferred<br>
addition time is between about 15 minutes to about 2 hours.<br>
The Lewis acid should be present in amounts<br>
sufficient to react with the number of halogens being<br>
substituted on compounds of Formula (XXXI). A range of<br>
between about 1 to about 5 mol equivalents of Lewis acid can<br>
be used. The preferred Lewis acid is aluminum, chloride.<br>
The synthesis of compounds of Formula (III), (IV),<br>
or (V) can be performed by methods commonly known in the art.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art with little or no<br>
experimentation can determine the appropriate conditions to<br>
obtain the polymer product desired.<br>

of the present invention can be incorporated into such<br>
material in any one of a variety of conventional manners,<br>

in a UV screening composition such as a sunscreen<br>
composition.<br>

ALIPHATIC POLYAMIDE<br>
The novel alkyated para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention can also be used with aliphatic polyamide polymers.<br>
An "Aliphatic polyamide" is a polyamide characterized by the<br>
presence of recurring carbonamide groups as an integral part<br>
of the polymer chain which are separated from one another by<br>
at least two aliphatic carbon atoms. Illustrative of these<br>
polyamides are those having recurring monomeric units<br>
represented by the general formula:<br><br>
or a combination hereof in which R and R1 are the same or<br>
different and are alkylene groups of at least about two<br>
carbon atoms, preferably alkylene having from about 2 to<br>
about 12 carbon atoms. Exemplary of such polyamides are<br>
polyamides formed by the reaction of diamines and diacids<br>
such as poly (tetramethylene adipamide) (nylon 4,6);<br>
poly(hexamethylene adipamide) (nylon 6,6); poly<br>
(hexamethylene azelamide) (nylon 6,9); poly(hexamethylene<br>
sebacamide) (nylon 6,10); poly(heptamethylene pimelamide)<br>
(nylon 8,8); poly(nonamethylene azelamide) (nylon 9,9);<br>
poly(decamethylene azelamide) (nylon 10,9); and the like.<br>
Also illustrative of useful aliphatic polyamides are those<br>
formed by polymerization of amino acids and derivatives<br>
thereof, as for example lactams. Illustrative of these useful<br>
polyamides are poly(4-aminobutyric acid) (nylon 4); poly(6-<br>
aminohexanoic acid) (nylon 6); poly(7-aminoheptanoic acid)<br>
(nylon 7); poly(8-aminoocatanoic acid) (nylon 8);<br>
poly(9aminononanoic acid) (nylon 9); poly(10-aminodecanoic<br>
acid) (nylon 10); poly(11-aminoundecanoic acid) (nylon 11);<br>
poly(12-aminododecanoic acid) (nylon 12); and the like.<br>
Blends of two or more aliphatic polyamides may also be<br>
employed.<br>
Copolymers formed from any combination of the<br>
recurring units of the above referenced aliphatic polyamides<br>
can be used. By way of illustration and not limitation, such<br>
aliphatic polyamide copolymers include<br>
caprolactam/hexamethylene adipamide copolymer (nylon 6/6,6);<br>
hexamethylene adipamide/caprolactam copolymer (nylon 6, 6/6);<br>
hexamethylene adipamide/hexamethylene-azelamide copolymer<br>
(nylon 6,6/6,9); and copolymers formed from recurring units<br>
of the above referenced aliphatic polyamides with<br>
aliphatic/aromatic polyamide recurring units may also be<br>
used- Examples of such copolyamides are nylon 6/6T; nylon<br>
6,6/6, T; nylon 6/10T; nylon 6/12T; nylon 6,10/6,T etc.<br>
Preferred aliphatic polyamides for use in the<br>
practice of this invention are poly(caprolactam); poly(7-<br>
aminoheptanic acid); poly(tetramethylene adipamide);<br>
poly(hexamethylene adipamide); and mixtures thereof. The<br>
particularly preferred aliphatic polyamides are<br>
poly(caprolatam); poly(hexamethylene adipamide);<br>
poly(tetramethylene adipamide); and mixtures thereof.<br>
Aliphatic polyamides useful in the practice of this<br>
invention may be obtained from commercial sources or prepared<br>
in accordance with known preparatory techniques. For example,<br>
polycaprolactam may be obtained from Allied Signal Inc. and<br>
poly(hexamethylene adipamide) may be obtained from DuPont Co.<br>
The number average molecular weight of the<br>
aliphatic polyamide may vary widely. Usually, the aliphatic:<br>
polyamide is of film forming molecular weight that is<br>
sufficiently high to form a free standing film and<br>
sufficiently low to allow melt processing of the blend into a<br>
film. Such number average molecular weights are well known<br>
to those of skill in the film art and are usually at least<br>
about 5,000 as determined by the formic acid viscosity<br>
method. In this method, a solution of 9.2 wt. Concentration<br>
of aliphatic polyamide in 90% formic acid at 25°C is used.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the number<br>
average molecular weight of the aliphatic polyamide is from<br>
about 5,000 to about 1,000,000 and in the particularly<br>
preferred embodiments is from about 10,000 to about 100,000.<br>
Amongst the particularly preferred embodiments, most<br>
preferred are those in which the molecular weight of the<br>
aliphatic polyamide is from about 20,000 to about 40,000.<br>
POLYURETHANE<br>
Polyurethane (PUR) elastomer products ("spandex")<br>
can be stabilized against discoloration and loss of<br>
elasticity during UV light exposure with combinations of UV<br>
absorbers according to the invention and hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers. Spandex fibers is a PUR elastomer product,<br>
which requires very specific UV absorber and hindered amine<br>
light stabilizers properties in order to achieve optimum<br>
performance. UV absorbers of the triazine class of this<br>
invention can be combined with polymeric hindered amine light<br>
stabilizers (HALS) to provide outstanding performance in<br>
achieving the desired properties for the Spandex fiber<br>
applications.<br>
The triazine UV absorber of the invention, used<br>
alone or in combination with HALS provides the following<br>
properties in the Spandex fiber application: (1) low color<br>
contribution at typical use levels in the 0.5-2.0% range; (2)<br>
sufficient MW, thermal stability and low volatility for fiber<br>
processing and thermal exposure conditions; (3) high<br>
compatibility and permanence; (4) prevent discoloration and<br>
loss of elasticity during exposure to UV light energy; (5)<br>
low extraction by water and dry cleaning solvents; (6) low<br>
color development during exposure to atmospheric pollutants,<br>
NOX, SOX, hydrocarbons, etc.; (7) low interaction with sea<br>
water and pool chemicals; (8) low interaction and color<br>
development with typical phenolic antioxidants used for the<br>
thermal stabilization of Spandex fibers; and (9) low<br>
interaction with copper based antioxidant systems used in<br>
Nylon fibers for Nylon/Spandex fabrics.<br>
The triazine UV absorber with or without the<br>
polymeric HALS provides outstanding stabilization with<br>
minimum negative effect on secondary performance properties,<br>
such as low color development, during NOX exposure and low<br>
interaction with copper based antioxidant systems using in<br>
Nylon fibers.<br>
As noted above, any of the triazine compounds<br>
disclosed herein can be used to impart one or more of the<br>
properties described above to Spandex fibers when added<br>
thereto in a stabilization effective amount.<br>
Preferably, these triazine compounds are added in<br>
combination with polymeric HALS. The polymeric HALS is<br>
preferably poly[(6-morpholino-s-triazine-2,4-<br>
diyl)[2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)imino]-hexamethylene<br>
t(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)imino]]. Most preferably,<br>
the polymeric HALS is the methylated (M) version of the above<br>
HALS, which is sold by Cytec Industries, Inc. as CYASORB®UV-<br>
3529 light stabilizer. Other polymeric HALS disclosed in US<br>
Patent 4,331,586 are also suitable.<br>
Spandex fibers are made from a polyurethane (PUR)<br>
prepolymer prepared from a diisocyanate and a glycol. There<br>
are four basic processes used to convert the PUR prepolymer<br>
into the fiber product. These processes are Solution Dry<br>
Spinning, Solution Wet Spinning, Melt Extrusion, and Reaction<br>
Spinning. The above UV stabilizer alone or in combination<br>
with HALS would be suitable for use in any or all four<br>
processes.<br>
Spandex fibers may contain a processing antioxidant<br>
system, such as a phenolic antioxidant, or a<br>
phenolic/phosphite antioxidant combination. In addition,<br>
pigments, such as TiO2 are commonly used in the fiber<br>
products.<br>
The triazine UV absorber alone or with M-HALS can<br>
be dissolved into DMF or DMAC and added to the PUR prepolymer<br>
solution prior to solution fiber spinning processes. Also,<br>
the combination can be extrusion compounded into the PUR<br>
compound used in the melt spinning process.<br>
POLYCARBONATES<br>
Among polymeric compounds, preference is given to<br>
the polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, polyacetals,<br>
polyphenylene oxides and polyphenylene sulfides, but<br>
especially to the polycarbonates. Those compounds are to be<br>
understood as being especially those polymers the<br>
constitutional repeating unit of which corresponds to the<br>
formula:<br><br>
wherein A is a divalent phenolic radical. Examples of A are<br>
given inter alia in U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,863 and<br>
DE-A-3 922,496. A can be derived, for example, from<br>
hydroquinone, resorcinol, dihydroxybiphenylene or bisphenols<br>
in the broadest sense of the term, such as<br>
bis(hydroxyphenyl)alkanes, cycloalkanes, sulfides, ethers,<br>
ketones, sulfones, sulfoxides, a,a'-bis(hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
diisopropylbenzenes, for example the compounds 2,2-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
propane, 2,2-bis(3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1-<br>
bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, or from the compounds of the<br>
formulae:<br><br><br>
In one embodiment, the preferred resins are<br>
polycarbonates based on dihydric phenols such as 2,2-bis-(4-<br>

hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylbutane; 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-<br>
cyclohexane; 2,2-bis-(3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)propane; 4,4'-<br>
sulfonyldiphenol; and 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-<br>
trimethy1cyclohexane.<br>
Also preferred are polycarbonate copolymers<br>
incorporating two or more phenols, branched polycarbonates<br>
wherein a polyfunctional aromatic compounds is reacted with<br>
the dihydric phenol(s) and carbonate precursor, and polymer<br>
blends of which polycarbonate comprises a significant portion<br>
of the blend.<br>
The most preferred resins for both layers are<br>
polycarbonates based on bisphenol A.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,288,788 also describes<br>
polycarbonates and polyester carbonates, especially aromatic<br>
polycarbonates, for example those based on 2,2-bis(4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl)propane or 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane.<br>
British Patent Appn. No. 2,290,745 describes a<br>
number of methods have been developed to concentrate UV<br>
absorbers near or at the surface of polymeric materials.<br>
These include surface impregnation (see U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,309,220, 3,043,709, 4,481,664 and 4,937,026) and coating a<br>
plastic article with solutions containing thermoplastic<br>
resins and UV absorbers (see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,668,588 and<br>
4,353,965). Both techniques suffer from drawbacks including<br>
requiring additional processing steps (i.e. applying, drying<br>
or curing), and encounter difficulties associated with the<br>
handling of large processed articles. An additional<br>
drawback, particularly relevant to polycarbonate sheet<br>
production, is the detrimental effect such post addition<br>
treatment would have on the surface of the polymeric<br>
substrate.<br>
As described in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,445,872,<br>
application of surface layers via coextrusion takes place in<br>
a known manner in known coextrusion equipment as taught in<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,487,505 and 3,557,265. Coextrusion is a<br>
well recognized method of producing laminated thermoplastic<br>
materials by simultaneously extruding various numbers of<br>
layers which form a single composite material. U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,540,623 describes coextruded materials of at least<br>
forty layers. Other methods produce as few as two or three<br>
different layers.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention also relates to<br>
thermoplastic articles coated with a thermoplastic layer 0.1<br>
to 10 mil (0.00254 mm to 0.254 mm), preferable 0.1 to 5 mil<br>
(0.00254 mm to 0.127 mm), thick, in which said layer contains<br>
0.1% to 20% by weight of the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the present<br>
invention. Preferred concentrations of are 2% to 15% by<br>
weight; most preferred concentrations of 5% to 10% by weight.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention may be<br>
incorporated into the thermoplastics of the surfaces layer by<br>
standard methods such as dry mixing the additives with<br>
granular resin prior to extruding.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine layer may be applied to one or both<br>
sides of the thermoplastic article.<br>
Laminated thermoplastic articles which contain<br>
additional layers such as a water resistant layer as found in<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,322 are also part of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The core layer and the coating layer may be of the<br>
same thermoplastic resin or different thermoplastic<br>
polyesters, polyester carbonates, polyphenylene oxide,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates and copolymers<br>
and blends such as styrene and acrylonitrile on polybutadiene<br>
and styrene with maleic anhydride.<br>
Mixtures (polyblends) of such polymers with one<br>
another or with other polymers, for example with polyolefins,<br>
polyacrylates, polydienes or other elastomers in the form of<br>
impact strength modifiers.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention can also<br>
be chemically bonded to substrates, such as polymers, thereby<br>
greatly reducing the migration of such UV absorbers, e.g.,<br>
out of the substrate or away from the substrate surface. The<br>
bonding mechanism of the triazines of the present invention<br>
involves the formation of a bond (chemical and/or co-valent)<br>
between a functionality attached to the amido or carbamate<br>
group, e.g., by a pendant vinyl or hydroxyl group, and the<br>
"host" substrate, such as a polymer.<br>
Incorporation of the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the invention can be<br>
brought about by copolymerization, copolyaddition,<br>
copolycondensation, by reaction with a polymer which carries<br>
suitable functional groups, or by grafting, in a manner as<br>
disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 3,423,360 and<br>
5,189,084 which are incorporated herein by reference as if<br>
fully set forth.<br>
Bonding of the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the invention can<br>
occur by polymerization or copolymerization. In the case of<br>
the novel triazines of the present invention comprising<br>
pendant vinyl groups, polymerization or copolymerization with<br>
at least one vinyl monomer, e.g., (meth)acrylic acid, esters<br>
of (meth)acrylic acid such as methyl acrylate, amides of<br>
(meth)acrylic acid, hydroxyethylacrylate, olefins, vinyl<br>
chloride, styrene, butadiene, isoprene and acrylonitrile can<br>
be carried out to form homopolymers or copolymers in which<br>
the vinyl group is incorporated into the backbone of the<br>
1 polymer. Polymerization or copolymerization can be initiated<br>
by initiators, such as free radical, anionic and cationic<br>
types, or by actinic radiation, such as UV, electron beam, x-<br>
rays and gamma irradiation from a Co60 source, as is well<br>
known to those in the polymerization art. Polymerization or<br>
' copolymerization can be carried out in solution, in an<br>
emulsion, in a dispersion, in the melt, or in the solid state<br>
as is well known to those in the polymerization art.<br>
Also, bonding of the presently claimed para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
compounds of the present invention can be brought about by<br>
copolyaddition or copolycondensation. Such incorporation can<br>
be made by addition during the synthesis of an addition<br>
polymer or copolymer or by condensation during the synthesis<br>
of a condensation polymer or copolymer by methods known to<br>
those skilled in the art. For example, compounds of the<br>
formulas (I) - (V) containing the appropriate functional<br>
groups can be incorporated into polyesters, polyamides,<br>
polyurethanes, epoxy resins, melamine resins, alkyd resins,<br>
phenolic resins, polyurethanes, polycarbonates,<br>
polysiloxanes, polyacetals and polyanhydrides, to name but a<br>
few.<br>
In addition, compounds of the formulas (I) - (V)<br>
can be bonded to a monomeric component which is then<br>
incorporated into a polymer or copolymer, e.g., by the free<br>
radical initiated addition or copolycondensation methods<br>
described above. Analogous methods are disclosed in, for<br>
example, United States Patent No. 5,459,222 (incorporated by<br>
reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth) for<br>
the bonding of benzotriazole and benzophenone stabilizers to<br>
diol precursors which are then incorporated by condensation<br>
polymerization into polyurethanes and polyesters to impart UV<br>
stabilizing properties to said polymers.<br>
Alternately, the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl<br>
substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the invention may<br>
also be bonded to polymers by reaction with an oligomer<br>
and/or polymer which carries suitable functional groups. Fcr<br>
example, at least one triazine compound comprising a vinyl<br>
pendant group can be added, optionally with at least one<br>
other vinyl monomer or compound comprising a vinyl group, to<br>
unsaturated polyester resins, unsaturated polybutadiene<br>
oligomers or unsaturated rubbers and then cured by actinic<br>
radiation or by a free radical catalyst. Or, at least one<br>
triazine compound comprising a terminal functional group,<br>
such as hydroxyl or amido, may be reacted with a polymer<br>
and/or oligomer such as polyesters, polyurethanes and<br>
polydiols with reactive end-groups, partially hydrolyzed<br>
polyvinylacetate, epoxy resins, polysiloxanes and polymers<br>
comprising maleic anhydride, either in the main chain or as a<br>
side-chain, by methods analogous to those well known to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Grafting is yet another way of bonding of the<br>
presently claimed para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines to polymers and/or oligomers.<br>
Grafting may be carried out. in solution, in the melt, or in<br>
the solid state with the initiators or actinic radiation<br>
types discussed above for polymerization when, for example,<br>
the novel triazines of the present invention comprising<br>
pendant vinyl groups are used. Such para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines may be grafted<br>
to saturated polymers, e.g., polyolefins and their copolymers<br>
such as polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(ethylene—vinyl<br>
acetate), or to polymers comprising unsaturated moieties,<br>
e.g., polybutadiene, polyisoprene, ethylene-propylene-(diene<br>
monomer) terpolymers and polystyrene and its copolymers.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention may be<br>
used in widely varying amounts in such applications depending<br>
upon such things as the material to be stabilized and the<br>
particular application. However, when employed as a<br>
stabilizing additive for materials such as organic polymers,<br>
the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and<br>
triazines of the present invention are typically employed in<br>
amounts from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight, preferably<br>
from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and most preferably<br>
from about 0.1 to about 5% by weight, based on the weight of<br>
the material to be stabilized. In screening applications<br>
such as sunscreening compositions, the triazines are utilized<br>
in the same relative amounts but based on the total weight of<br>
the screening agent.<br>
The novel stabilizers of the present invention may<br>
also be employed in a non-bondable capacity, for example, in<br>
the stabilization of thermoplastic polymers as set forth in<br>
the many of the previously incorporated references. Examples<br>
of preferred thermoplastic polymers are polyolefins and<br>
polymers comprising heteroatoms in the main chain. Preferred<br>
polymers are also thermoplastic polymers comprising nitrogen,<br>
oxygen and/or sulphur, especially nitrogen or oxygen, in the<br>
main chain. Also of interest are compositions in which the<br>
polymer is a polyolefin, for example polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene.<br>
Incorporation into the thermoplastic polymers can<br>
be carried out by addition of the novel para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted triazine or pyrimidine compound and any<br>
further additives by the methods conventional in the art.<br>
The incorporation can expediently be made before or during<br>
shaping, for example by mixing the pulverulent components or<br>
by adding the stabilizer to the melt or solution of the<br>
polymer, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compounds<br>
to the polymer, with or without subsequent evaporation of the<br>
solvent. Elastomers can also be stabilized as lattices.<br>
The novel mixtures can also be added to the<br>
polymers to be stabilized in the form of a masterbatch which<br>
comprises these compounds, for example, in a concentration of<br>
from about 2.5 to about 25%, preferably from about 5 to about<br>
20% by weight of the polymer.<br>
The novel mixtures can expediently be incorporated<br>
into the polymeric material by any number of methods,<br>
including those conventionally employed in the art, including<br>
by, for example: a) as an emulsion or dispersion (for<br>
example to lattices or emulsion polymers); (b) as a dry mix<br>
during mixing of additional components or polymer mixtures;<br>
(c) by direct addition to the processing equipment (for<br>
example extruders, internal mixers, etc.); or (d) as a<br>
solution or melt.<br>
The stabilized polymer compositions obtained in<br>
this way can be converted into shaped articles, for example<br>
fibers, films, tapes, sheets, sandwich boards, containers,<br>
pipes and other profiles, by any number of conventional<br>
methods, for example hot pressing, spinning, extrusion, roto-<br>
molding or injection molding. Therefore, the present<br>
invention additionally relates to the use of the polymer<br>
composition according to the invention for the production of<br>
a shaped article.<br>
Depending upon their ultimate end use, the para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
of the present invention may be combined with a variety of<br>
additives conventionally employed in the UV stabilizing art.<br>

The novel para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidines and triazines of the present invention can also<br>
be employed in multilayer systems. In such systems, a<br>
polymer composition having from about 0.1 to about 20% by<br>
weight and preferably a relatively high content of novel<br>
stabilizer, for example, about 5-15% by weight, is applied in<br>
a thin film (e.g., about 5 - 500 pm thick and, preferably,<br>
about 10 - 100 urn thick) to a shaped article made from a<br>
polymer containing little or no ultraviolet stabilizers.<br>
Such composition may be applied at the same time as the<br>
shaping of the base structure, for example by coextrusion in<br>
a manner analogous to that described in United States Patent<br>
No. 4,948,666 (incorporated by reference herein for all<br>
purposes as if fully set forth). Alternatively, application<br>
can also be made to the ready-formed base structure, for<br>
example by lamination with a film or by coating with a<br>
solution. The outer layer or layers of the finished article<br>
have the function of a UV filter, which protects the interior<br>
of the article from UV light. The outer layer preferably<br>
contains about 0.1 to about 20%, preferably about 1 to about<br>
15%, and most preferably about 2 to about 10% by weight of<br>
the outer layer composition, of at least one of the para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
The polymers stabilized in this way are notable for<br>
high weathering resistance, especially for high resistance to<br>
UV light. This enables them to retain their mechanical<br>
properties, and their color surface properties such as gloss<br>
and distinctness of image, for a long time even when used<br>
outside. Moreover, due to the bondable nature of the<br>
presently claimed triazine compounds, migration of these UV<br>
absorbers between the layers of the multi-layer coatings can,<br>
under the appropriate circumstances, be minimized.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
novel mixtures comprising compounds of the formulas (I) - (V)<br>
can be used as stabilizers for coatings, for example for<br>
paints such as disclosed in numerous references (see, e.g.,<br>
US 4,619,956, US 4,740,542, US 4,826,978, US 4,962,142, US<br>
5,106,891, US 5,198,498, US 5,298,067, US 5,322,868, US<br>
5,354,794, US 5,369,140, US 5,420,204, US 5,461,151, US<br>
5,476,937, EP-0434608 and EP-A-0444323). Of particular<br>
interest are coatings and paints for the automobile industry.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to those compositions<br>
which are film-forming binders for coatings.<br>
Such novel coating compositions comprise about 0.01<br>
to about 20%, preferably about 0.01 to about 10%, and more<br>
preferably about 0.02 to about 5% by weight of the binder of<br>
the coating composition of the presently claimed para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
of the present invention.<br>
Multilayer systems are possible here as well (such<br>
as electrocoat/basecoat/clearcoat systems), where the<br>
concentration of the novel stabilizer in one or more of the<br>
layers, and typically the outer layer such as the clearcoat,<br>
can be relatively high, for example from about 0.01 to about<br>
20%, preferably about 0.01 to about 10%, and more preferably<br>
about 0.02 to about 5% by weight of binder.<br>
The use of the novel stabilizer in coatings is<br>
accompanied by the additional advantage that it prevents<br>
delamination, i.e. the flaking-off of the coating from the<br>
substrate. This advantage is particularly important in the<br>
case of metallic substrates, including multilayer systems on<br>
metallic substrates, and particularly epoxy e-coated metallic<br>
substrates.<br>
The binder can in principle be any binder which is<br>
customary in industry, for example those described in<br>
Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition,<br>
Vol. A18, pp. 368-426, VCH, Weinheim 1991 which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. In general, it is a film-<br>
forming binder based on a thermoplastic or curable resin,<br>
predominantly on a curable resin. Examples of thermoplastic<br>
binders include acrylics, polyesters, polyurethanes and PVC<br>
plastisols. Examples of curable binders include functional<br>
alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic, melamine, epoxy and<br>
polyurethane resins and mixtures thereof.<br>
Such curable binders can be an ambient curable or a<br>
thermosetting binder. Further, in some systems it may be<br>
advantageous to add a curing catalyst to such systems.<br>
Suitable catalysts which accelerate curing of the binder are<br>
described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, Vol. A18, p. 469, VCH<br>
Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim 1991. Preferred binders<br>
include those which comprise a functional acrylate resin and<br>
a crosslinking agent.<br>
A wide variety of binders may be employed in such<br>
coating systems. Examples of suitable coating compositions<br>
containing specific binders include but are not limited to:<br>
1. paints based on ambient curable or thermosetting alkyd,<br>
acrylate, polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of<br>

In addition to the binder and novel para-tertiary<br>
alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines of the<br>
present invention, the coating composition according to the<br>
invention preferably further comprise one or more additional<br>
ultraviolet light absorbers, including but not limited to<br>
those specifically listed above in section b. The additional<br>
UV absorbers may be, for example, another tris-aryl-1,3,5-<br>
triazine, a 2-hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole, a 2-<br>
hydroxybenzophenone, an ester of an unsubstituted benzoic<br>
acid, an acrylate, an oxamide (oxanilide), or any combination<br>
of the above. Preferably, the additional UV absorber is a 2-<br>
hydroxyphenyl-2H-benzotriazole and the weight ratio of<br>
benzotriazole to amido or carbamate triazine is 4:1 to 1:4.<br>
More preferably, the weight ratio of benzotriazole to amido<br>
or carbamate triazine is 2:1 to 1:2.<br>
To achieve maximum light stability, it is of<br>
particular interest to add sterically hindered amines,<br>
examples of which are set out in the above-mentioned section<br>
b(vi). The invention therefore also relates to a coating<br>
composition which, in addition to the binder, the novel para-<br>
tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidines and triazines<br>
and, optionally, additional UV absorbers, comprises a light<br>
stabilizer of the sterically hindered amine type. The<br>
sterically hindered amine is employed in an amount of about<br>
0.01 to 5% by weight based on the weight of the solid binder,<br>
preferably about 0.02 to 2% by weight.<br>
One specific example of such a sterically hindered<br>
amine is a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperazinone containing at<br>
least one group of the formula:<br><br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such<br>
as methyl), alkoxy (such as methoxy) or acyl.<br>
More preferably the stabilizer is a 2,2,6,6-<br>
tetraalkylpiperidine derivative containing at least one group<br>
of the formula:<br><br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such<br>
as methyl), alkoxy (such as methoxy) or acyl.<br>
Examples of tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives which<br>
can be used in combination with the present trisaryl-1,3,5-<br>
triazine compounds are given in United States Patent Nos.<br>
4,314,933, 4,344,876, 4,426,471, 4,426,472, 4,619,956,<br>
5,004,770, 5,006,577, 5,064,883, 5,112,890, 5,124,378,<br>
5,106,891, 5,204,473, and 5,461,151, which are incorporated<br>
by reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth.<br>
It is particularly expedient to employ the following<br>
tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives, as well as their N-alkyl,<br>
N-acyl, N-hydroxyl and N-alkoxy analogs (where not already<br>
included in the following list):<br>
bis (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) succinate,<br>
bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) sebacate,<br>
bis (1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yl) sebacate,<br>
di(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yl) butyl-(3,5-di-tert-<br>
butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)malonate, bis(l-octyloxy-2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) sebacate, tetra(2,2,6,6-<br>
tetramethylpiperid-4-yl) butane-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate,<br>
tetra(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperid-4-yl) butane-1,2,3,4-<br>
tetracarboxylate, 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-oxa-3,2 0-diaza-21-<br>
oxo-dispiro[5.1.11.2]heneicosane, and 8-acetyl-3-dodecyl-<br>
1,3,8-triaza-7,7,9,9-tetramethylspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione.<br>
Commercially available examples of these and other<br>
tetraalkylpipieridine derivatives include SANDUVOR® 3050,<br>
3052, 3055, 3056, 3058, PR-31 and PR-32 (Clariant Corp.);<br>
TINUVIN® 079L, 123, 144, 292, 440L and 622LD (Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals); CHIMASORB® 119 and 944 (Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals); and CYASORB® UV-3346, UV 3529, UV-3853, UV-500<br>
and UV-516 (Cytec Industries Inc.).<br>
Apart from the binder, the para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine, and, if used, the<br>
additional ultraviolet light absorber or stabilizer, the<br>
coating composition can also comprise further components,<br>
examples being solvents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers,<br>
stabilizers, thixotropic agents, drying catalysts and/or<br>
leveling agents. Examples of possible components are those<br>
described in many of the previously incorporated references<br>
as well as Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry,<br>
5th Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 429-471, VCH, Weinheim 1991; and<br>
Calbo, Leonard J. , ed., Handbook of Coatings Additives, New<br>
York:Marcel Dekker (1987).<br>
Possible drying catalysts or curing catalysts are,<br>
for example, organometallic compounds, amines, acids, amino-<br>
containing resins and/or phosphines.<br>
Examples of acid catalysts are mineral acids,<br>
aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids (e.g. p-toluene<br>
sulfonic acid, dinonylnaphthalene disulfonic acid,<br>
dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid), oxalic acid, maleic acid,<br>
hexamic acid, phosphoric acid, alkyl phosphate esters,<br>
phthalic acid and acrylic acid copolymers.<br>
Examples of organometallic compounds are metal<br>
carboxylates, especially those of the metals Pb, Mn, Co, Zn,<br>
Zr or Cu, or metal chelates, especially those of the metal<br>
Al, It or Zr, or organometallic compounds such as organotin<br>
compounds, for example. Examples of metal carboxylates are<br>
the stearates of Pb, Mn or Zn, the octoates of Co, Zn or Cu,<br>
the naphthenates of Mn and Co or the corresponding<br>
linoleates, resinates or tallates. Examples of metal<br>
chelates are the aluminum, titanium or zirconium chelates of<br>
acetylacetone, ethyl acetylacetate, salicylaldehyde,<br>
salicylaldoxime, o-hydroxyacetophenone or ethyl<br>
trifluoroacetylacetate and the alkoxides of these metals.<br>
Examples of organotin compounds are dibutyltin oxide,<br>
dibutyltin dilaurate or dibutyltin dioctoate.<br>
Examples of amine drying or curing catalysts are,<br>
in particular, tertiary amines, for example tributylamine,<br>
triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-<br>
dimethylethanolamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylmorpholine<br>
or diazabicyclooctane (triethylenediamine) and salts thereof.<br>
Further examples are quaternary ammonium salts, for example<br>
trimethylbenzylammonium chloride. Amino-containing resins<br>
are simultaneously binder and curing catalyst. Examples<br>
thereof are amino-containing acrylate copolymers.<br>
The curing catalyst used can also be a phosphine,<br>
for example triphenylphosphine.<br>
Another type of curing catalyst is a peroxide which<br>
can be used, for example, to cure a gel coating for a<br>
fiberglass article.<br>
The novel coating compositions can also be<br>
radiation-curable coating compositions. In this case, the<br>
binder essentially comprises monomeric or oligomeric<br>
compounds containing ethylenically unsaturated bonds, which<br>
after application are cured by actinic radiation, i.e.<br>
converted into a crosslinked, high molecular weight form.<br>
Where the system is UV-curing, it generally contains a<br>
photoinitiator as well. Corresponding systems are described<br>
in the above-mentioned publication Ullmann's Encyclopedia of<br>
Industrial Chemistry, 5th Edition, Vol. A18, pages 451-453.<br>
In radiation-curable coating compositions, the novel<br>
stabilizers can also be employed without the addition of<br>
sterically hindered amines.<br>
The novel coating compositions according to the<br>
invention can be applied to any desired substrates, for<br>
example to metal, wood, plastic, fiberglass or ceramic<br>
materials. The coating compositions can be pigmented mono-<br>
coats or multi-layer (primer/basecoat/clearcoat) systems<br>
typical of automotive finishes. In the latter case, the<br>
novel coating composition can be used for either the base<br>
coat, or clear coat, or for both layers.. If the topcoat of<br>
an automotive finish comprises two layers, of which the lower<br>
layer is pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the<br>
novel coating composition can be used for either the upper or<br>
the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the<br>
upper topcoat layer.<br>
The novel coating compositions can be applied to<br>
the substrates by the customary methods, for example by<br>
brushing, spraying, pouring, dipping or electrophoresis; see<br>
also Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th<br>
Edition, Vol. A18, pp. 491-500.<br>
Depending on the binder system, the coatings can be<br>
cured at room temperature or by heating. Thermosetting<br>
coatings are preferably cured at 50 - 150°C and, in the case<br>
of powder coatings, even at higher temperatures.<br>
The coatings obtained in accordance with the<br>
invention have excellent resistance to the damaging effects<br>
of light, oxygen and heat; particular mention should be made<br>
of the good light stability and weathering resistance of the<br>
coatings thus obtained, for example paints.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a coating,<br>
in particular a paint, which has been stabilized against the<br>
damaging effects of light, oxygen and heat by a content of<br>
the compound of the formulas (I) - (V), according to the<br>
invention. The paint can be a pigmented mono-coat which<br>
comprises a film-forming binder and an organic pigment or<br>
dye, an inorganic pigment, a metallic pigment, or a mixture<br>
thereof. The paint may also be a composition which comprises<br>
a primer in adhesion to a metal or plastic substrate; a<br>
pigmented basecoat that is in adhesion to the primer and<br>
which comprises a film-forming binder and an organic pigment<br>
or dye, an inorganic pigment, a metallic pigment, or a<br>
mixture thereof; and a clear coat that is in adhesion to the<br>
base coat and which comprises a film-forming binder and<br>
optionally a transparent pigment. One especially preferred<br>
use is a paint which is a clear topcoat for automobile<br>
original equipment manufacture (OEM) and/or refinish<br>
applications.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for<br>
stabilizing a coating based on polymers against damage by<br>
light, oxygen and/or heat, which comprises mixing with the<br>
coating composition a mixture comprising a compound of a<br>
para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine<br>
and to the use of mixtures comprising para-tertiary alkyl<br><br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine compound in coating<br>
compositions as stabilizers against damage by light, oxygen<br>
and/or heat.<br>
The coating compositions can comprise an organic<br>
solvent or solvent mixture in which the binder is soluble.<br>
The coating composition can otherwise be an aqueous solution<br>
or dispersion. The vehicle can also be a mixture of organic<br>
solvent and water. The coating composition maybe a high-<br>
solids paint or can be solvent-free (e.g. a powder coating<br>
material).<br>
The pigments can be inorganic, organic or metallic<br>
pigments. The novel coating compositions preferably contain<br>
no pigments and are used as a clearcoat.<br>
Likewise preferred is the use of the coating<br>
composition as a topcoat for applications in the automobile<br>
industry, especially as a pigmented or unpigmented topcoat of<br>
the paint finish. Its use for underlying coats, however, is<br>
also possible.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazines of this invention may be applied<br>
topically by polishing a surface with a composition<br>
comprising the para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazines and an inert carrier such as solvent,<br>
petroleum jelly, silicone oil in water emulsions, or<br>
automotive paint wax, e.g. Carnauba wax. These topical<br>
treatment compositions may be used to stabilize coating<br>
films, fabrics, leather, vinyl and other plastics and wood.<br>
Preference is also given to the use of the novel<br>
para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine<br>
compounds in photographic materials as stabilizer against<br>
damage by light, especially by UV light. The invention<br>
therefore also relates to a photographic material comprising<br>
an para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidine or<br>
triazine compound.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be<br><br>
used for photosensitive materials of all kinds. For example,<br>
they can be employed for color paper, color reversal paper,<br>
direct-positive color material, color negative film, color<br>
positive film, color reversal film and other materials. They<br>
are preferably used, inter alia, for photosensitive color<br>
material which comprises a reversal substrate or which forms<br>
positives.<br>
Furthermore, the novel compounds can be combined<br>
with other UV absorbers, especially those which are<br>
dispersible in aqueous gelatin, for example with<br>
hydroxyphenylbenzotriazoles (cf. for example United States<br>
Patent Nos. 4,853,471, 4,973,702, 4,921,966 and 4,973,701),<br>
benzophenones, oxanilides, cyanoacrylates, salicylates, or<br>
acrylonitriles or thiazolines. In this context it is<br>
advantageous to employ these further, oil-dissolved UV<br>
absorbers in the photographic material in layers other than<br>
those comprising the novel UV absorbers.<br>
The present invention also encompasses compositions<br>
containing one or more binders. In particular, the binder<br>
may comprise an alkyd, acrylic, polyester, phenolic,<br>
melamine, epoxy or polyurethane resin, or blends thereof.<br>
Examples of such binders include, but are not limited to:<br>
(a) cold- or hot-crosslinkable alkyd, acrylate,<br>
polyester, epoxy or melamine resins or mixtures of<br>
such resins;<br>
(b) a two-component polyurethane system comprising<br>
hydroxyl-containing acrylate, polyester or<br>
polyether resins and aliphatic or aromatic<br>
isocyanates, isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br>
(c) a one-component polyurethane system comprising<br>
blocked isocyanates, isocyanurates or<br>
polyisocyanates which are deblocked during baking;<br>
(d) a two-component system comprising (poly)ketimines<br>
and aliphatic or aromatic isocyanates,<br>
isocyanurates or polyisocyanates;<br><br>
(e) a two-component system comprising (poly)ketimines<br>
and an unsaturated acrylate resin or a<br>
polyacetoacetate resin or a methacrylamidoglycolate<br>
methyl ester;<br>
(f) a two-component system comprising carboxyl- or<br>
amino-containing polyacrylates and polyepoxides;<br>
(g) a two-component system comprising acrylate resins<br>
containing anhydride groups and on a polyhydroxy or<br>
polyamino component;<br>
(h) a two-component system comprising (poly)oxazolines<br>
and acrylate resins containing anhydride groups, or<br>
unsaturated acrylate resins, or aliphatic or<br>
aromatic isocyanates, isocyanurates or<br>
polyisocyanates;<br>
(i) a two-component system comprising unsaturated<br>
polyacrylates and polymalonates;<br>
(j) a thermoplastic polyacrylate system comprising<br>
thermoplastic acrylate resins or externally<br>
crosslinking acrylate resins in combination with<br>
etherified melamine resins; and<br>
(k) a system comprising siloxane-nodified or fluorine-<br>
modified acrylate resins.<br>
Such binder-containing compositions may further comprise a<br>
curing catalyst, or an organic solvent, and may be radiation-<br>
curable. In particular, such compositions may serve as<br>
coating compositions.<br>
In particular, it is possible successfully to<br>
stabilize photographic materials similar to those described<br>
in United States Patent No. 4,518,686.<br>
The invention therefore additionally relates to a<br>
photographic material comprising, on support, a blue-<br>
sensitive, a green-sensitive and/or a red-sensitive silver-<br>
halide emulsion layer and, if desired, a protective layer,<br>
with a layer comprising a UV absorber being arranged above<br>
the uppermost silver-halide emulsion layer, wherein the UV<br><br>
absorber is a para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine compound.<br>
Preference is additionally given to photographic<br>
materials which have a layer comprising a compound of the<br>
formula (I) - (V) above the uppermost silver-halide emulsion<br>
layer and/or between the green- and red-sensitive silver-<br>
halide emulsion layers.<br>
Furthermore, it may be advantageous for all or some<br>
of the said layers which can comprise a UV absorber to have a<br>
UV absorber mixture and/or a further UV absorber which is<br>
dispersible in aqueous gelatin, but a compound of the formula<br>
(I) - (V) must be present at least in one layer.<br>
The novel material preferably has gelatin<br>
interlayers between the silver-halide emulsion layers.<br>
Preference is given to photographic materials in<br>
which the silver halide in the blue-sensitive, green-<br>
sensitive and/or red-sensitive layer is silver chloride<br>
bromide comprising at least 90 mol % of silver chloride.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) - (V), which are<br>
used in accordance with the invention, can be incorporated,<br>
alone or together with the color coupler and, if used,<br>
further additives, into the color photographic materials by<br>
dissolving the compounds beforehand in high-boiling organic<br>
solvents. It is preferred to use solvents which boil at<br>
higher than 160°C. Typical examples of such solvents are the<br>
esters of phthalic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid,<br>
benzoic acid or of fatty acids, or alkylamides and phenols.<br>
Preferred color couplers for use in the<br>
compositions of the invention, examples of such compounds,<br>
further additives such as color cast inhibitors, DIR couplers<br>
and further light stabilizers, such as UV absorbers, phenols,<br>
phosphorus (III) compounds, organometallic complexes,<br>
hydroquinones and hydroquinone ethers, and more precise<br>
details on the structure of various photographic materials,<br>
can be found, for example, in the publications EP-A-0531258<br><br>
and EP-A-0520938 and in the literature cited therein.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the<br>
stabilization of polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer films for<br>
agricultural applications, especially greenhouse<br>
applications, this polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer film<br>
having improved light stability and pesticide resistance,<br>
comprising incorporation of a sterically hindered amine and a<br>
metal oxide of hydroxide selected from oxides of zinc,<br>
aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc,<br>
aluminum and calcium, into the polyolefin or polyolefin<br>
copolymer. A further subject of the invention is a<br>
greenhouse, characterized in that it is covered by a<br>
polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer film having improved light<br>
stability and pesticide resistance and stabilized with a<br>
sterically hindered amine and a metal oxide or hydroxide<br>
selected from oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and<br>
magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc, aluminum and calcium, and<br>
a process for stabilizing a polyolefin or polyolefin<br>
copolymer greenhouse film against detrimental effects of<br>
pesticides and light, oxygen and/or heat, which process<br>
comprises incorporation of a sterically hindered amine and a<br>
metal oxide or hydroxide selected from oxides of zinc,<br>
aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and hydroxides of zinc,<br>
aluminum and calcium, into said greenhouse film..<br>
Further subjects of the invention are the use of a<br>
polyolefin copolymer film stabilized with a sterically<br>
hindered amine and a metal oxide or hydroxide selected from<br>
oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and magnesium, end<br>
hydroxides of zinc, aluminum and calcium for agricultural<br>
applications involving pesticides, especially greenhouse<br>
applications, and the use of a sterically hindered amine in<br>
combination with a metal oxide or hydroxide selected from<br>
oxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and<br>
hydroxides of zinc, aluminum, calcium and magnesium, and<br>
hydroxides of zinc, aluminum and calcium for the<br><br>
stabilization of polyolefin or polyolefin copolymer films in<br>
contact with pesticides against photodegradation and damage<br>
by pesticides.<br>
To form a film, forcing a quantity of the said<br>
melted composition through a film die, such as a flat film<br>
die or a circular blown film die, and forming a film<br>
therefrom. In the case where the composition is used to form<br>
a film therefrom, it is contemplated that the films may be<br>
unoriented, or may be subjected to a conventional operation<br>
to impart a degree of orientation on the film. Such a film<br>
may be oriented in one direction, such as in the machine<br>
direction, such as in the "machine direction" and/or the<br>
"transverse direction", or may be oriented in both<br>
directions, or "biaxially" oriented.<br>
The present invention is also suitable for sheet<br>
applications.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine compounds of the formula (I) - (V) are<br>
suitable for the photochemical stabilization of undyed, dyed<br>
or printed fiber materials comprising for example, silk,<br>
leather, wool, polyamide or polyurethanes and especially<br>
cellulose-containing fiber materials of all kinds. Examples<br>
of such fiber materials are the natural cellulose fibers,<br>
such as cotton, linen, jute and hemp and also viscose staple<br>
fiber and regenerated cellulose. Preferred textile fiber<br>
materials are those of cotton. The triazine and pyrimidine<br>
compounds of the present invention are also suitable for the<br>
photochemical stabilization of hydroxyl-containing fibers in<br>
blend fabrics, for example blends of cotton with polyester<br>
fibers or polyamide fibers. A further preferred area of<br>
application relates to the blocking or reduction of the UV<br>
radiation which passes through the above-mentioned textile<br>
materials (UV cutting) and the heightened sun protection<br>
which textile materials finished with a novel compound offer<br>
to the human skin.<br><br>
To this end, one or a number of different compounds<br>
of the formula (I) - (V) are applied to the textile fiber<br>
material by one of the customary dyeing methods,<br>
advantageously in a quantity of 0.01 to 5% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.1 to 3% by weight and, in particular, from 0.25<br>
to 2% by weight, based on the weight of the fiber material.<br>
The para-tertiary alkyl phenyl substituted<br>
pyrimidine or triazine compounds can be applied to the fiber<br>
material in various ways and fixed on the fiber, especially<br>
in the form of aqueous dispersions or printing pastes.<br>
The textile fiber materials finished with the novel<br>
compounds of the formula (I) - (V) possess improved<br>
protection against photochemical breakdown of the fiber and<br>
yellowing phenomena and, in the case of dyed fibre material,<br>
are of enhanced (hot) light fastness. Particular emphasis<br>
should be drawn to the greatly improved photoprotective<br>
effect of the treated textile fiber material and, in<br>
particular, the good protective effect with respect to short-<br>
wave UV-B rays. This is manifested by the fact that the<br>
textile fiber material finished with an para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine compound has,<br>
relative to untreated fabric, a greatly increased sun<br>
protection factor (SPF).<br>
The sun protection factor is defined as the<br>
quotient of the dose of UV radiation which damages protected<br>
skin to that which damages unprotected skin. Accordingly, a<br>
sun protection factor is also a measure of the extent to<br>
which untreated fiber materials and fiber materials treated<br>
with a novel compound of the formulas (I) - (V) are permeable<br>
to UV radiation. The determination of the sun protection<br>
factor of textile fiber materials is explained, for example,<br>
in WO94/04515 or in J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 40, 127-133 (1989)<br>
and can be carried out analogously thereto.<br>
Yet another use of the UV absorbers according to<br>
the invention is in the stabilization of intra-ocular and<br><br>
contact lenses.<br>
The inventive UV absorbers are suitable as<br>
photoprotective agents in cosmetic preparations. The<br>
invention additionally relates, therefore, to a cosmetic<br>
preparation comprising at least one para-tertiary alkyl<br>
phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine compound and<br>
cosmetically acceptable carriers or auxiliaries.<br>
The novel cosmetic composition contains from 0.1 to<br>
15% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight, based on<br>
the overall weight of the composition, of a para-tertiary<br>
alkyl phenyl substituted pyrimidine or triazine UV absorber<br>
and a cosmetically acceptable auxiliary.<br>
The cosmetic composition can be prepared by<br>
physically mixing the novel UV absorber with the auxiliary by<br>
means of customary methods, for example by simply stirring<br>
together the two materials.<br>
The cosmetic preparation according to the invention<br>
can be formulated as a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion,<br>
as an oil-in-oil alcohol lotion, as a vesicular dispersion of<br>
an ionic or nonionic amphiphilic lipid, as a gel, solid stick<br>
or as an aerosol formulation.<br>
As a water-in-oil or oil-in-water emulsion, the<br>
cosmetically acceptable auxiliary preferably contains from 5<br>
to 50% of an oily phase, from 5 to 20% of an emulsifier and<br>
from 30 to 90% water. The oil phase can comprise any oil<br>
which is suitable for cosmetic formulations, e.g., one or<br>
more hydrocarbon oils, a wax, a natural oil, a silicone oil,<br>
a fatty acid ester or a fatty alcohol. Preferred mono- or<br>
polyols are ethanol, isopropanol, propylene glycol, hexylene<br>
glycol, glycerol and sorbitol.<br>
For these cosmetic formulations, it is possible to<br>
use any conventionally employed emulsifier, e.g., one or more<br>
ethoxylated esters of naturally occurring derivatives, i.e.,<br>
polyethoxylated esters of hydrogenated castor oil; or a<br>
silicone oil emulsifier such as silicone polyol; an<br><br>
unmodified or ethoxylated fatty acid soap; an ethoxylated<br>
fatty alcohol; an unmodified or ethoxylated sorbitan ester;<br>

chloro-1,3,5-triazine<br>
To a 2- neck flask equipped with a reflux<br>
condenser, an argon inlet, a magnetic stirring bar and a<br>
glass stopper was introduced 9.2 g of cyanuric chloride. To<br>
it was added 125 mL of tert-butylbenzene followed by 8 g of<br>
aluminum chloride at room temperature. The reaction mixture<br>
was then gradually heated to 65°C and kept at this temperature<br>
for 3.5 hr. At this stage an additional 8 g of aluminum<br>
trichloride was added and the reaction mixture was heated at<br>
75°C for 3 hr. The heating was discontinued and the reaction<br>
mixture was left at room temperature overnight and then<br>
treated with 300 mL of ice-cold dilute HC1 for 2 hr. The<br>
mixture was extracted with methylene chloride and the organic<br>
layer separated, washed with water, dried over anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to<br>
dryness. The residue so obtained was treated with acetone.<br>
The precipitated material was filtered off which was<br>
characterized to be mainly 2,4,6-tris(4-tert-butylphenyl)-<br>
1,3,5-triazine. The filtrate was concentrated and purified<br>

Example A: Stabilized Polycarbonate Composition<br>
Polycarbonate plaques are prepared as follows. GE<br>
Lexan 105 barefoot natural flake polycarbonate resin (melt<br>
temperature 310 - 333°C) is dry blended with 0.35% stabilizer<br>
plus 0.10 wt% Mark® 2112 phosphite. The blended compositions<br>
are melt-mixed and extruded in a Haake torque rheometer<br>
equipped with a a 0.75-inch 25 : 1 single mixing screw<br>
extruder. The zone temperatures are 246, 265, 295, and<br>
304°C. The extruded polycarbonate is pulled through a water<br>
bath, dried, pelletized, and redried at 120°C for 4 - 48 hr<br>
in a forced air oven. The pellets are injection molded at<br>
305 -- 310°C using an Arburg "Allrounder" hydraulic injection<br>
molder to form 2 x 2.5 x 0.100-inch plaques. The zone<br>
temperatures are: nozzle - 305°C; nozzle side - 310°C;<br>
middle - 300°C; and feed - 290°C. The mold temperature is<br>
100°C. Delta E data is obtained using a Macbeth Color Eye<br>
Colorimeter with illuminate C, 2° observer, specular<br>
component excluded, and UV component included.<br>
The plaques are exposed in a xenon-arc<br>
WeatherOmeter following ASTM G-26 using Test Method B (Miami,<br>
Fla. conditions). The conditions are an irradiance of 0.35<br>
W/m2 at 340 nm, alternating cycles of light and darkness,<br>
intermittent water spray, and a black panel temperature of 63<br>
± 3°C. Delta E (total color change) is measured after 400<br>
hr. of exposure. Polycarbonate compositions containing the<br>
para-t-butyl Compound have less total color change than the<br>
unstabilized control composition.<br>
Example B: Stabilized Coating Compositions<br>
Stabilized clear acrylic melamine compositions are<br>
prepared and coated onto steel panels for accelerated<br>
weathering testing as follows. The para-tert-butyl compound<br>
(2% based on total resin solids) is pre-dissolved in xylenes,<br>
alone and in combination with Sanduvor® 3058 HALS (0.67% or<br>
1.0% based on total resin solids), and added to the clear<br>
acrylic melamine formulation given in Table I. Steel panels<br>
pre-coated with ED5050A E-coat, 764204 primer, and 542DF716<br>
white base-coat and measuring 4" x 12" are obtained from ACT<br>
Laboratories, Inc. (Hillsdale, Michigan). The panels are<br>
coated with the clear coat formulations using the draw-down<br>
technique (WC-52 Wire-Cators™ obtained from Leneta Co., Ho-<br>
Ho-Kus, N.J.). The clear coats are allowed to flash for 10<br>
min. at ambient temperature and cured for 30 min. at 135°C.<br><br>
Accelerated weathering is carried out with a QUV<br>
following ASTM G53 (GM cycle), which is weathering under<br>
alternate cycles of (i) UV light at 70°C for 8 hours and (ii)<br>
condensation with no UV light at 50°C for 4 hr. Specular<br>
properties (gloss and distinctness of image, or DOI) are<br>
measured as a function of weathering time. Compositions<br>
containing 2% para-tert-butyl triazine have improved gloss<br>
and DOI retention relative to the unstabilized control.<br>
Compositions containing 1% HALS S-3058 in addition to para-<br>
tert-butyl triazine also exhibit improved gloss and DOI<br>
retention.<br>
Example C: Stabilized Coating Compositions Containing 2,4-<br>
bis (4-tert-butylphenyl)-6-(2-acetoxy-4-octyloxyphenyl)-1,3,5-<br>
triazine<br>
Canadian patent application 2,162,645 has<br>
experimental data which shows that 2-acetoxy triazine UV<br>
absorbers improve the weatherability of acrylic melamine<br>
coating compositions. Weatherability is defined in terms of<br>
gloss retention. However no data on the yellowing behavior<br>
of these coating compositions was given. We have found that<br>
coating compositions containing 2-acetoxy triazines yellow<br>
upon exposure to UV light. We have further discovered that<br>
coating compositions containing the 2-(2-acetoxy-4-<br>
octyloxyphenyl)-4,6-bis-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine<br>
yellow less than those containing 2-(2-acetoxy-4-<br>
hexyloxyphenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (Compound A12 of<br>
the cited patent).<br>
The coating compositions were weathered using both<br>
UVB-313 bulbs (UV light intensity maximum at 313 nm) and UVA-<br>
340 bulbs (UV light intensity maximum of 340 nm). The<br>
results are summarized in Tables II and III. Under both<br>
weathering conditions, the t-Butyl compound surprisingly gave<br>
less yellowing. In the UVB-313 example, both equal weight<br>
(3.00%) and equimolar amounts (2.31%) of Compound A were<br>
evaluated. Even when compared against the lower, equimolar<br>
level of Compound A, the t-Butyl compound still afforded less<br>
yellowing.<br><br>
