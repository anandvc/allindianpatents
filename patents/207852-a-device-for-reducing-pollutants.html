TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A device for reducing pollutants emitted by vehicles<br>
Field of Invention :-<br>
The present invention is related to a device for reducing pollutants emitted by diesel-operated vehicles or engines. The device consisting of an internal cylinder with perforated holes, encircled by a metal coil and covered by an external cylinder in an air tight manner.<br>
BACK GROUND<br>
Increasing Pollution of our environment has become a serious problem affecting all forms of life including human life. As evident, from reports-based on scientific survey and the press, Air pollution related medical problems like Asthma, Allergy, Respiratory Tract Infections like bronchitis and lung cancer are on the increase. This is mainly because the human body is not designed to withstand the onslaught of excessive pollutants especially harmful gases in the environment.<br>
Ever increasing vehicular traffic with their unchecked emission of smoke contributes maximum to the environmental pollution.<br>
Automobile emissions is a continued environmental problem<br><br>
The main emissions of a car engine are :- Nitrogen gas (N2),Carbon Dioxide (Co2), Water Vapor (H20).<br>
There emissions are mostly benign. But there are emissions which are relatively in small amount but which are more harmful which include Carbon monoxide (Co), Hydrocarbons or Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxide. These gases cause irritation to human mucus membrane and cause inflammations and allergy. This also creates smog, ozone, cancer, lung disease and other illness. Breathing problems are the main casualties of the pollutants.<br>
Countries all our the world have made laws that govern the owners of Automobiles in such a way that is supposed to reduce or at least regulate the total amount of Automobile pollutants to a minimal point. Emissions produced and discharged into the environment can damage the entire environment severely.<br>
The problems inherent to automobile transportation stem from the use of petrol or diesel. The burning of the fuels give off the pollutants. While the dangers of Air pollution are still existing the Industries have been making significant improvement to limit the pollution. To accomplish this, the industry is turning towards either combining both an electrical battery and an internal combustion engine in a 'hybrid' vehicles or an electric battery and motor to achieve<br><br>
a zero emission level. Other mechanism including 'anti¬pollution', spark plug, 'Pre-stratified charge systems, newly designed 4-stroks engines or innovative exhaust gas recirculation systems, are also being used to increase the fuel efficacy and decrease the emission of current cars. Aside from modifying the use of ordinary gasoline to decrease emissions a some what more promising tactic is the conversion to other chemicals for fuel- Methanol, Natural Gas and Electricity. The natural gas would yield less No, Co2, less Hydro carbons  and Carbon monoxide.<br>
One of the important advances made in this direction ie to reduce the emissions further, is a device called a catalytic converter - which treats the exhaust before it leaves the car and minimise pollution. Usually converters use 2 different types of catalysts, i.e a reduction catalyst and an oxidation catalyst. Catalysts are exposed to the exhaust stream. There 2 main types of structures used in catalytic converters -honeycomb and ceramic beads. Most cars today use a honeycomb structure. Catalytic converters have definite advantages but also short comings - as they work only at a very high temperature which is not practical to achieve in normal circumstances.<br>
It is an object of the present invention in its preferred form to  provide  a  device  which  can  substantially  reduce  the<br><br>
pollutants emitted by any engine or vehicle especially using diesel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS :-<br>
Referring to the drawings, the device for reducing pollutants includes an internal cylinder (1) with perforated holes (2) and horizontal ridges (3,6) as depicted in Figure Nol. The internal cylinder is encircled by a copper coil with spirals (7) and the ends of the coils (8,9) are connected to diesel filter disk and engine respectively as depicted in Figure No.2.<br>
The internal cylinder and the encircling copper coil is covered by an external cylinder (10) and the sides of the external cylinder (13) is closed with flanges (11,12) on either side and further supported by rods attached to the strips (14)  on the flanges.<br><br>
DESCRIPTIONS<br>
The following is the description of the pollutants reducing device and the best known method of working this invention.<br>
In its main embodiment the invention consist of a device to be attached to the exhaust pipe, which helps in increasing the temperatures of the diesel circulating through the engine of the vehicle which results in reduction of the pollutants emitted by the vehicle.<br>
The device essentially consist of 3 parts i.e.<br>
1) An internal cylinder with the diameter similar to that of exhaust pipe and with holes and an internal partition attached to the exhaust pipe by cutting a small portion of the pipe and replacing by the cylinder. Internal cylinder is covered by a special copper hollow coil; instead of the diesel going throw directly from the diesel filter disc to the engine it now passes through the copper coil encircling internal cylinder before reaching to engine. The end of this coil is attached to the filter disc of the vehicle through diesel pipe using preferably benzonut &amp; bolt . The other end is similarly connected to the engine. The diesel is circulated through their tube continuously.<br>
3] The internal cylinder and the encircled copper coil is completely covered by an external cylinder either side of which is tightly secured by flanges with a hole in the center for fixing it to the exhaust pipe. Multiple rods attached to the pipeline on the flanges connecting both the flanges and keep them in a secured position.  Ridges on the internal<br><br>
cylinders act as guards helping appropriate fixing for the flanges.<br>
When the engine starts , the diesel circulated through the copper coil encircling the internal cylinder. The hot exhaust air enters the internal cylinder and comes out of holes due to the partition and fills up the external cylinder instead of passing out directly . This helps in heating up the copper coil containing diesel. The desired temperature is obtained by the changing number of spirals of the coil. More the number of coils, more is the contact with hot air and higher the temperature. Though coils can be of different numbers of spirals, in the present example of inventions 10-20 spirals of the coils have been found satisfactory.<br>
In the present example of the preferred embodiment, the size of the internal cylinder could be between 10 to 20 inches. This may be vary depending on the need and the type of the vehicle. The device specifically the internal cylinder is preferably placed in the anterior portion of the exhaust pipe, by cutting a small part of the exhaust pipe and replacing it by the internal cylinder of the same diameter. Experimental studies have confirmed the efficacy of the device in reducing smoke and pollutants emitted by the vehicles.<br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
I claim:<br>
1. A device for reducing pollutants emitted by diesel or petrol operated vehicles and engines, attached to the exhaust pipe of vehicle comprises -<br>
an internal hollow, cylinder with a similar diameter as that of the exhaust pipe having perforated holes and an internal partition which is fixed to the exhaust pipe of the vehicle preferably by replacing a small portion of the exhaust pipe and encircled by -<br>
a hollow metallic coil in the spiral form, one end of which is connected to the diesel tank with a diesel tube and the other end is connected to the engine with a diesel tube and both the internal cylinder and coil are enclosed in-<br>
an external cylinder in an airtight engagement, but allowing the ends of the coil to come out and to be connected to the diesel tank and engine respectively.<br>
