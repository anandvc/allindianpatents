BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a system for producing melt-phase polyesters. In another aspect, the invention concerns an esterification system employing a reactant-containing paste requiring little or no cooling.<br>
2.	Description of the Prior Art<br>
Melt-phase polymerization can be used to produce a variety of polyesters, such as, for example, polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PET is widely used in beverage, food, and other containers, as well as in synthetic fibers and resins. Advances in process technology coupled with increased demand have lead to an increasingly competitive market for the production and sale of PET. Therefore, a low-cost, high-efficiency process for producing PET is desirable.<br>
Generally, melt-phase polyester production facilities, including those used to make PET, employ an esterification stage and a polycondensation stage. In the esterification stage, polymer raw materials (i.e., reactants) are converted to polyester monomers and/or oligomers. In the polycondensation stage, polyester monomers exiting the esterification stage are converted into a polymer product having the desired final chain length.<br>
In most conventional melt-phase polyester production facilities, esterification is carried out in one or more mechanically agitated reactors, such as, for example, continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). However, CSTRs and other mechanically agitated reactors have a number of drawbacks that can result in increased capital, operating, and/or maintenance costs for the overall polyester production facility. For example, the mechanical agitators and various control equipment typically associated with CSTRs are complex, expensive, and<br>
can require extensive maintenance. Further, conventional CSTRs frequently employ internal heat exchange tubes that occupy a portion of the reactor's internal volume. In order to compensate for the loss in effective reactor volume, CSTRs with internal heat exchange tubes require a larger overall volume, which increases capital costs. Further, internal heat exchange coils typically associated with CSTRs can undesirably interfere with the flow patterns of the reaction medium within the vessel, thereby resulting in a loss of conversion. To increase product conversion, many conventional polyester production facilities have employed multiple CSTRs operating in series, which further increases both capital and operating costs.<br>
Thus, a need exists for a high efficiency polyester process that minimizes capital, operational, and maintenance costs while maximizing product conversion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process comprising: (a) producing an alcohol-containing liquid from a distillation zone; (b) mixing at least a portion of the alcohol-containing liquid with solid particles of an acid to thereby provide a paste; (c) combining the paste with a recirculation liquid to thereby provide an esterification feed; and (d) subjecting at least a portion of the esterification feed to esterification in an esterification zone, wherein the temperature of the paste when combined with the recirculation liquid is not more than 150C cooler than the temperature of the alcohol-containing liquid when exiting the distillation zone.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a process comprising: (a) subjecting an esterification feed comprising terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol to esterification in a first esterification zone defined within the tubes of a shell-and-tube heat exchanger to thereby produce a first product having a conversion of at<br>
least about 50 percent; (b) subjecting at least a portion of the first product to vapor/liquid separation in a disengagement zone defined within a disengagement vessel to thereby produce a second liquid product and a second vapor product, wherein the second liquid product has a higher conversion than the first product; (c) subjecting at least a portion of the second vapor product to distillative separation  in a distillation zone to thereby produce a third vapor product and a third liquid product, wherein the third vapor product comprises at least about 50 mole percent water and the third liquid product comprises at least about 50 mole percent ethylene glycol; (d) mixing at least a portion of the third liquid product with solid particles of terephthalic acid to thereby provide a paste; and (e) combining at least a portion of the paste with a recirculation liquid to thereby provide a combined stream, wherein the temperature of the paste when combined with the recirculation liquid is not more than 150Â°C cooler than the temperature of the third liquid when exiting the distillation zone, wherein the recirculation liquid comprises at least a portion of the second liquid product, wherein the esterification feed comprises at least a portion of the combined stream.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the enclosed figure, wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic depiction of an esterification system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention and suitable for use in a melt-phase polyester production facility.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention can be employed in melt-phase polyester production facilities capable of producing a variety of polyesters from a variety of starting materials. As used herein, the term "polyester" also includes polyester derivatives, such as, for example, polyetheresters,<br>
polyester amides, and polyetherester amides. Examples of melt-phase polyesters that can be produced in accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, homopolymers and copolymers of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), PETG (PET modified with 1,4-cyclohexane-dimethanol (CHDM) comonomer), fully aromatic or liquid crystalline polyesters, biodegradable polyesters, such as those comprising butanediol, terephthalic acid and adipic acid residues, poly(cyclohexane-dimethylene terephthalate) homopolymer and copolymers, and homopolymers and copolymers of CHDM and cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid or dimethyl cyclohexanedicarboxylate.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, polyester starting<br>

subjected to esterification in an initial stage of the process. The acid<br>
starting material can be a dicarboxylic acid such that the final polyester<br>
product comprises at least one dicarboxylic acid residue having in the<br>

tetramethyl-cyclobutane, 2,2,4,4tetramethyl-cyclobutanediol, 2,2-bis-(3-<br>
hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane,	2,2-bis-(4-hydroxy-propoxyphenyl)-<br>
propane, Jsosorblde, hydroquinone, BDS-(2,2-(sulfonylbis)4,1-phenyleneoxy))bis(ethanol), and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition, in one embodiment, the starting materials can<br>
comprise one or more comonomers. Suitable comonomers can include,<br>
for example, comonomers comprising terephthalic acid, dimethyl<br>
terephthalate, isophthalic acid, dimethyl Isophthaiate, dimethyl-2,6-<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylate, 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid, ethylene<br>

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, one or more additives can be added to the starting materials, the polyester, and/or the polyester precursors at one or more locations within the process. Suitable additives can include, for example, trifunctional or tetrafunctional comonomers, such as trimellitic anhydride, trimethylolpropane, pyromellitic dianhydride, pentaerythritol, or other polyacids or polyols; crosslinking or branching agents; colorant; toner; pigment; carbon black; glass fiber; filler; impact modifier; antioxidant; UV absorbent compound; and oxygen scavenging compound.<br>
In general, the polyester production process according to one embodiment of the present invention can comprise two main stages.<br>
The first stage reacts starting materials (also referred to herein as "raw materials" or "reactants") into monomers and/or oligomers. The second stage further reacts the monomers and/or oligomers into the final polyester product.<br>
If the starting materials entering the first stage include acid end groups, such as, for example, terephthalic acid or isophthalic acid, the first stage is referred to as esterification.   If the starting materials have methyl end groups, such as, for example, dimethyl terephthalate or dimethyl isophthalate, the first stage is referred to as ester exchange or trans-esterification.    For simplicity, the term "esterification" as used herein,   includes  both  esterification  and  ester exchange  reactions. According to one embodiment of the present invention, esterification can take place at a temperature in the range of from about 220'C to about 300Â°C, or about 235Â°C to about 290Â°C, or 245Â°C to 280Â°C and a pressure of less than about 25 psig, or a pressure in the range of from about 1 psig to about 10 psig, or 2 psig to 5 psig.   In one embodiment, the average chain length of the monomer and/or oligomer exiting the esterification stage can be less than about 25, from about 1 to about 20, or from 5 to 15.<br>
The second stage of the process can be referred to as the polycondensation stage. The polycondensation stage can be a single step process, or can be divided into a prepolycondensation (or prepolymerization) step and a final (or finishing) polycondensation step. Generally, longer chain polymers can be produced via a multi-stage polycondensation process. The polycondensation stage can be carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 220Â°C to about 350Â°C, or about 240Â°C to about 320Â°C and a sub-atmospheric (e.g., vacuum) pressure. When polycondensation is carried out in a two-stage process, the prepolymerization (or prepolymer) reactor can convert the monomer exiting the esterification stage into an oligomer having an average chain length in the range of from about 2 to about 40, from about 5 to about<br>
35, or from 10 to 30. The finisher reactor then converts the oligomer/polymer mixture into a final polymer product having the desired average chain length.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the esterification stage  can  be  carried  out in  an  esterification  system comprising at least one esterification zone and at least one distillation zone.  In the esterification zone, reactants are subjected to esterification to thereby produce a vapor byproduct and a liquid product containing polyester monomers and/or oligomers.   A product portion of the liquid product exiting the esterification zone can exit the esterification system for downstream processing, while a recirculation portion of the liquid product exiting the esterification zone can be recirculated back to the inlet of the esterification zone. At least a portion of the vapor byproduct exiting the esterification zone can be routed to the distillation zone, wherein water and alcohol components of the vapor byproduct can be separated. A portion of the separated alcohol exiting the distillation zone can be combined with solid acid particles to create a paste, which can then be added to the recirculation portion of the liquid product exiting the esterification  zone.     The  resulting  combined  stream  can  then  be reintroduced  into  the  esterification  zone,   after  receiving  additional quantities of reactants and/or additives.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of the esterification zone can be defined by equipment that imparts little or no mechanical agitation to the liquid phase of the reaction medium processed therein. Although the liquid phase of the reaction medium processed in the esterification zone may be somewhat agitated by virtue of flowing through the equipment that defines the esterification zone, in one embodiment of the present invention, less than about 50 percent, less than about 25 percent, less than about 10 percent, less than about 5 percent, or 0 percent of the agitation of the liquid phase reaction medium processed in the esterification zone is provided by mechanical<br>
agitation. This is in direct contrast to conventional esterification processes that are carried out in one or more continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) under conditions of extreme mechanical agitation.<br>
As discussed further in detail below, the present invention can employ simple, reliable, and inexpensive equipment for carrying out esterification. For example, in one embodiment of the present Invention, at least a portion of the esterification zone can be defined within a simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive heater, such as, for example, a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. Further, in another embodiment, at least a portion of the esterification zone can be defined within a simple, reliable, and relatively inexpensive unagitated esterification vessel.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, an esterification system 10 configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated as generally comprising a heat exchanger 12, an esterification vessel 14, a distillation column 16, a recirculation loop 18, and a paste tank 50. In general, the process carried out in esterification system 10 includes the following broad steps: (1) introducing an esterification feed into heat exchanger 12; (2) heating and partially esterifying the esterification feed in heat exchanger 12; (3) introducing at least a portion of the heated and partially esterified product from heat exchanger 12 into esterification vessel 14; (4) further esterifying the partially esterified product from heat exchanger 12 in esterification vessel 14; (5) separating a liquid product from a vapor byproduct in esterification vessel 14; (6) introducing at least a portion of the vapor byproduct from esterification vessel 14 into distillation  column   16;   (7)  separating  the  vapor  byproduct  into  a predominately water overhead stream and a predominately alcohol bottom stream in distillation column 16; (8) combining at least a portion of the predominantly alcohol bottom stream with solid acid particles to form a paste in paste tank 50; (9) routing a recirulation portion of the liquid product from esterification vessel 14 back to heat exchanger 12 via recirulation loop 18; (10) while the recirculation portion of the liquid<br>
product is flowing through recirculation loop 18, adding thereto fresh alcohol, additive(s), and/or paste from paste tank 50; and (10) withdrawing a product portion of the liquid product from esterification vessel 14 for further downstream processing.<br>
As indicated above, esterification can be carried out in both heat exchanger 12 and esterification vessel 14 of esterification system 10. Since esterification can be carried out in both heat exchanger 12 and esterification vessel 14, each of these pieces of equipment can be referred to as "esterification reactors" that each define a portion of an "esterification zone." However, because an additional function of heat exchanger 12 can be to heat the reaction medium processed therein, heat exchanger 12 can also be referred to as a "heater" that defines a "heating zone." Further, since an additional function of esterification vessel 14 can be to promote vapor/liquid disengagement, esterification vessel 14 can also be referred to as a "disengagement vessel" that defines a "disengagement zone." The configuration and operation of esterification system 10, illustrated in FIG. 1, will now be described in greater detail.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, a recirculated liquid product stream, discussed in more detail below, is transported through a recirculation conduit 100. As illustrated in FIG. 1, the following materials can be added to the recirculated liquid product stream flowing through recirculation conduit 100: (a) fresh alcohol introduced via conduit 104, (b) one or more additives introduced via conduit 106, and (c) an acid-containing paste, discussed in further detail below, introduced via conduit 108. In another embodiment, at least a portion of the streams in conduits 104 and/or 106 can be added to the stream exiting esterification vessel 14 in conduit 114, which will be discussed in detail below. In yet another embodiment, at least a portion of the streams in conduits 104 and/or 106 can be introduced directly into a yet-to-be-discussed recirculation pump 40.   The fresh alcohol in conduit 104 and<br>
the acid of the acid-containing paste in conduit 108 can be any of the alcohols and acids, respectively, discussed above as being suitable for use as starting materials in the system of the present invention. According to one embodiment, the alcohol can be ethylene glycol and the acid can be terephthalic acid. The one or more additives in conduit 106 can be any of the additives discussed above as being suitable for used in the system of the present invention.<br>
Generally, the amount of alcohol and acid-containing paste added to the recirculation stream in recirculation conduit 100 can be any amount necessary to provide the desired production rate and the desired alcohol-to-acid ratio. In one embodiment of the present invention, the molar alcohol-to-acid ratio of the esterification feed stream exiting recirculation conduit 100 is in the range of from about 1.005:1 to about 10:1, about 1.01:1 to about 8:1, or 1.05:1 to 6:1.<br>
The combined stream exiting recirculation conduit 100 can be introduced as an esterification feed into an inlet 22 of heat exchanger 12 via a feed  conduit  110.     In  heat exchanger 12,  the esterification feed/reaction   medium   is   heated   and   subjected   to   esterification conditions.     In  accordance  with  one  embodiment  of the  present invention, the temperature increase of the reaction medium between the inlet 22 and an outlet 24 of heat exchanger 12 can be at least about 50Â°F, at least about 75F, or at least 85F.  Generally, the temperature of the esterification feed entering inlet 22 of heat exchanger 12 can be in the range of from about 220Â°C to about 260Â°C, about 230Â°C to about 250Â°C,   or  235Â°C  to  245Â°C.     Generally,   the   temperature   of the esterification product exiting outlet 24 of heat exchanger 12 can be in the range of from about 240'C to about 320Â°C, about 255Â°C to about 300Â°C, or 275Â°C to 290Â°C.   The reaction medium in heat exchanger 12 can be maintained at a pressure in the range of from about 5 to about 50 psig, from about 10 to about 35 psig, or from 15 to 25 psig.<br>
As   discussed   previously,   heat  exchanger   12   can   also   be considered an esterification reactor because at least a portion of the reaction medium flowing therethrough can undergo esterification.   The amount of esterification carried out in accordance with the present invention can be quantified in terms of "conversion." As used herein, the term "conversion" is used to describe a property of the liquid phase of a stream that has been subjected to esterification, wherein the conversion of the esterified stream indicates the percentage of the original acid end groups that have been converted (i.e., esterified) to ester groups. Conversion can be quantified as the number of converted end groups (i.e., alcohol end groups) divided by the total number of end groups (i.e., alcohol plus acid end groups), expressed as a percentage.    While conversion is used herein, it should be understood that average chain length, which describes the average number of monomer units that a compound comprises, could also be appropriate for describing the characteristics of the streams of the present invention as well.<br>
According to one embodiment, the esterification reaction carried<br>
out in heat exchanger 12 can increase the conversion of the reaction<br>
medium between inlet 22 and outlet 24 by at least about 5, at least about<br>
10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 30, or at least<br>
about 50 percentage points.   Generally, the esterification feed stream<br>
introduced into inlet 22 of heat exchanger 12 has a conversion of less<br>
than about 90 percent, less than about 75 percent, less than about 50<br>
percent, less than about 25 percent, less than about 10 percent, or less<br>
than 5 percent, while the esterification product stream exiting outlet 24 of<br>
heat exchanger 12 has a conversion of at least about 50 percent, at<br>
least about 60 percent, at least about 70 percent, at least about 75<br>
percent, at least about 80 percent, at least about 85 percent, at least<br>
about 95 percent, or at least 98 percent.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the esterification reaction carried out in heat exchanger 12 takes place at a significantly<br>
reduced residence time relative to conventional esterification processes. For example, the average residence time of the reaction medium flowing through heat exchanger 12 can be less than about 60 minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 35 minutes, or less than 20 minutes. This relatively short residence time can even be achieved at high, commercial scale production rates. Thus, in one embodiment, the product stream exits outlet 24 of heat exchanger 12 at a flow rate of at least about 10,000 pounds per hour (Ib/h), at least about 25,000 Ib/h, at least about 50,000 Ib/h, at least about 100,000 Ib/h, or at least 200,000 Ib/h.<br>
Turning now the specific configuration of heat exchanger 12.   In<br>
accordance  with   one  embodiment  of  the  present  invention,   heat<br>
exchanger 12 can be a horizontally elongated, shell-and-tube heat<br>
exchanger.   An internal flow passageway through heat exchanger 12<br>
can be defined by the heat exchange tubes through which the reaction<br>
medium  flows  as  it  is  heated  and  esterified.     This  internal  flow<br>
passageway can be considered to be a "first esterification zone" of<br>
esterification system 10. Generally the aggregate volume of the internal<br>
flow passageway through heat exchanger can be In the range of from<br>
about 10 to about 1,500 cubic feet (ft3), about 100 to about 800 ft3 or<br>
200 to 600 ft3.    The average inner diameter of the individual heat<br>
exchange tubes can be less than about 4 Inches, or in the range of from<br>
about 0.25 to about 3 inches, or 0.5 to 2 inches.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a stream of warmed heat transfer medium (HTM) can enter the shell-side of heat exchanger 12 and at least partly surround at least a portion of the heat exchange tubes in order to heat the reaction medium flowing therethrough. In one embodiment of the present invention, the heat transfer coefficient associated with the heating of the reaction medium in heat exchanger 12 can be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 200 BTU per hour per Â°F per square foot (BTU/hÂ°Fft2), about 5 to about 100 BTU/hÂ°F-ft2 or from  10 to 50<br>
BTU/h-Â°Fft2. The total amount of heat transferred to the reaction medium in heat exchanger 12 can be in the range of from about 100 to about 5,000 BTU per pound of reaction medium (BTU/lb), about 400 to about 2,000 BTU/lb, or 600 to 1,500 BTU/lb.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 1, the partially esterified product exiting heat<br>
exchanger 12 via outlet 24 can be transported to esterification vessel 14<br>
via conduit 112.   The partially esterified stream in conduit 112 can be<br>
introduced into the internal volume of esterification vessel 14 via a fluid<br>
inlet 26. As discussed previously, in esterification vessel 14, the partially<br>
esterified  stream   is  subjected  to  further  esterification   and   phase<br>
separation. Thus, the internal volume defined within esterification vessel<br>
can be considered to be a "second esterification  zone" and/or a<br>
"disengagement zone." Generally, the reaction medium in esterification<br>
vessel 14 flows substantially horizontally through the internal volume.<br>
As the reaction medium flows away from fluid inlet 26 and undergoes<br>
esterification,  vapor byproducts  escape  the  liquid  phase  and  flow<br>
generally above the liquid phase. The separated liquid product can exit<br>
esterification vessel 14 via a liquid outlet 28, while the separated vapor<br>
byproduct can exit esterification vessel 14 via vapor outlet 30.<br>
The esterification reaction carried out in esterification vessel 14 can increase the conversion of the reaction medium processed therein so the liquid product exiting liquid outlet 28 has a conversion that is at least about 1 percentage point, at least about 2 percentage points, or at least 5 percentage points higher than the conversion of the fluid stream entering fluid inlet 26. Generally, the liquid product exiting liquid outlet 28 of esterification vessel 14 can have conversion of at least about 80 percent, at least about 85 percent, at least about 90 percent, at least 95 percent, or at least about 98 percent.<br>
The conversion achieved in esterification vessel 14 can occur during a relatively short residence time and with little or no heat input. For example, the average residence time of the reaction medium in<br>
esterification vessel 12 can be less than about 200 minutes, less than about 60 minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 30 minutes, or less than 15 minutes. Further, the amount of heat transferred to the reaction medium in esterification vessel 14 can be less than about 100 BTU per pound of reaction medium (BTU/lb), less than about 20 BTU/lb, less than about 5 BTU/lb, or less than 1 BTU/lb.<br>
With minimal or no heat input in esterification vessel 14, the average temperature of the liquid product exiting liquid outlet 28 of esterification vessel 14 can be within about 50'C, about 30Â°C, about 20Â°C, or 15Â°C of the average temperature of the fluid entering esterification vessel 14 via fluid inlet 26. Generally, the average temperature of the liquid product exiting liquid outlet 28 of esterification vessel 14 can be in the range of from about 220Â°C to about 320'C, about 240Â°C to about 300Â°C, or about 250Â°C to about 275Â°C.<br>
Turning now to the specific configuration of esterification vessel 14. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, esterification vessel 14 is a substantially empty, unagitated, unheated, generally cylindrical, horizontally elongated vessel. Esterification vessel 14 and can have a length-to-diameter (L:D) ratio of less than about 10:1, in the range of from about 1.25:1 to about 8:1, about 1.5:1 to about 6:1, or 2:1 to 4.5:1. In one embodiment, fluid inlet 26, liquid outlet 28, and vapor outlet 30 are spaced from on another in a manner that provides sufficient esterification and enhances disengagement/separation of the vapor, liquid, and foam phases. For example, liquid outlet 28 and vapor outlet 30 can be horizontally spaced from the fluid inlet 26 by at least about 1.25D, at least about 1.5D, or at least 2.0D. Further, liquid outlet 28 and vapor outlet 30 can be vertically spaced from one another by at least about 0.5D, at least about 0.75D, or at least 0.95D.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, esterification vessel 14 can comprise a fluid distributor 32 to aid in the effective distribution of the feed to esterification vessel 14.   In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, fluid<br>
distributor is simply a substantially horizontally extending pipe having a downwardly curved distal end that defines fluid inlet 26 with a downwardly facing orientation. Alternatively, fluid distributor 32 can define a plurality of openings for discharging the partially esterified feed at multiple horizontally spaced locations in esterification vessel 14. In one embodiment of the present invention, the average depth of the reaction medium in esterification vessel 14 is maintained at less than about 0.75D, less than about 0.50D, less than about 0.25D, or less than 0.15D as it travels substantially horizontally through esterification vessel 14.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, upon entering esterification vessel 14, the reaction medium exiting fluid distributor 32 can begin to foam as the vapor bubbles disengage from the liquid portion of the reaction medium. Generally, foam production can decrease along the length of esterification vessel 14 as the vapor disengages from the liquid phase of the reaction medium so that, in one embodiment, substantially no foam exits liquid outlet 28 and/or vapor outlet 30 of esterification vessel 14.<br>
To help ensure that substantially no foams exits vapor outlet 30 of esterification vessel  14, a downwardly extending baffle 34 can  be employed  in esterification vessel  14.     Baffle  34  can  generally be disposed between fluid inlet 26 and vapor outlet 30 of esterification vessel 14, but closer to vapor outlet 30 than to fluid inlet 26.   Baffle 34 can   extend  downwardly  from  the  top  of  esterification   vessel   14 proximate vapor outlet 30 and can function to physically block the flow of foam, if any, towards vapor outlet 30. In one embodiment of the present invention, baffle 34 can present a bottom edge vertically spaced at least about 0.25D, at least about 0.5D, or at least 0.75D from the bottom of esterification vessel 14.   In the embodiment Illustrated in FIG. 1, baffle includes a downwardly extending portion 36 and a laterally extending portion 38.   Downwardly extending portion 36 can extend downwardly from a location proximate vapor outlet 30, while laterally extending<br>
portion 38 can extend transversely from the bottom end of downwardly extending portion 36 to a location generally under vapor outlet 30.<br>
The total internal volume defined within esterification vessel 14 can depend on a number of factors, including, for example, the overall hydrodynamic requirements of esterification system 10. In one embodiment of the present invention, the total internal volume of esterification vessel 14 can be at least about 25 percent, at least about 50 percent, at least about 75 percent, at least about 100 percent, or at least 150 percent of the total internal volume of recirculation loop 18, described in further detail below. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the total internal volume of esterification vessel 14 can be at least about 25 percent, at least about 50 percent, at least about 75 percent, or at least 150 percent of the aggregate internal volume of recirculation loop 18, the flow passageway within heat exchanger 12, and product conduit 112.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 1, a liquid ester product can exit liquid outlet 28 of esterification vessel 14 and can thereafter be introduced into recirculation loop 18. Recirculation loop 18 defines a flow passageway from liquid outlet 28 of esterification vessel 14 to inlet 22 of heat exchanger 12. Recirculation loop 18 generally comprises a liquid product conduit 114, a recirculation pump 40, a pump discharge conduit 116, recirculation conduit 100, pressure reducer 20, and feed conduit 110. The liquid ester product discharged from esterification vessel 14 can flow initially through product conduit 114 to the suction of recirculation pump 40. The stream exiting pump 40 can be passed though pump discharge conduit 116 and thereafter split into a product portion transported via ester product conduit 118 and a recirculation portion transported via recirculation conduit 100. The splitting of the stream exiting pump 40 can be carried out so that the ratio of the mass flow rate of the recirculation portion in conduit 100 to the mass flow rate of the product portion in conduit 118 can be in the range of from about<br>
0.25:1 to about 30:1, about 0.5:1 to about 20:1, or 2:1 to 15:1. As previously discussed, the recirculation portion in conduit 100 can eventually be employed as the feed to heat exchanger 12, after the addition of fresh alcohol via conduit 104, additive(s) via conduit 106, and/or acid-containing paste via conduit 108.<br>
The product portion of the liquid ester product in conduit 118 can be routed to a downstream location for further processing, storage, or other use. In one embodiment, at least a fraction of the product portion in conduit 118 can be subjected to further esterification in a second esterification zone. In another embodiment, at least part of the product portion in conduit 118 can be subjected to polycondensation in a downstream polycondensation zone.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the vapor stream exiting vapor outlet 30 of esterification vessel 14 via conduit 120 can be routed to a fluid inlet 42 of distillation column 16. The vapor byproduct stream in conduit 120 can comprise water and alcohol. The water and alcohol can be substantially separated from one another in distillation column 16 to thereby produce a predominately water overhead vapor stream exiting distillation column 16 via overhead outlet 44 and a predominately alcohol bottom liquid stream exiting distillation column 16 via lower outlet 46. Distillation column 16 can be any device capable of separating a stream into a predominantly vapor overhead product and a predominantly liquid bottoms product based on the relative volatilities of the components of the feed stream. Distillation column 16 can comprise internals such as, for example, trays, random packing, structured packing, or any combination thereof.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, the predominantly water overhead vapor stream exiting distillation column 16 via overhead outlet 44 can comprises at least about 50 mole percent, at least about 60 mole percent, or at least 75 mole percent water. The overhead vapor product discharged from outlet 44 of distillation column<br>
16 can be routed via conduit 122 to subsequent processing, storage, or disposal, such as, for example, a wastewater processing unit or a disposal means employing, for example, incineration.<br>
The predominately alcohol bottom liquid stream exiting distillation column 14 via lower outlet 46 can comprise at least about 50 mole percent, at least about 60 mole percent, or at least 75 mole percent alcohol (e.g., ethylene glycol).     In one embodiment of the present invention, the predominantly alcohol stream withdrawn from lower outlet 46 of distillation column 16 can have a temperature of at least about 150Â°C, in the range of from about 175Â°C to about 250Â°C, or 190Â°C to 230Â°C and a pressure in the range of from about 0.25 psig to about 50 psig, about 0.5 psig to about 35 psig, or 1 psig to 25 psig. As shown in FIG. 1, the liquid stream discharged from lower outlet 46 of distillation column can be transported in conduit 124 and thereafter split into a first alcohol-containing portion carried in conduit 126 and a second alcohol-containing portion carried in conduit 102.   The separated liquid stream from conduit 124 can be split in a manner such that the mass flow rate of the second portion of the alcohol-containing stream in conduit 102 can be at least about 25 percent, at least about 50 percent, or at least 75 percent of the mass flow rate of the liquid product in conduit 124.  The first alcohol-containing  portion  in  conduit  126  can  then  be  routed downstream for further processing, storage, and/or reuse.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of the second alcohol-containing stream in conduit 102 can be mixed with solid acid particles in order to form the previously-discussed acid-containing paste. The solid acid particles can be any of the acids discussed above as being suitable for use as starting materials in the system of the present invention. To optimize the final properties (e.g., viscosity) of the acid-containing paste, the alcohol-containing stream in conduit 102 can be cooled via indirect heat exchange means 48, as shown in FIG. 2. The indirect heat exchange means 48 can be any heat<br>
exchange means known in the art capable of reducing the temperature of the alcohol-containing stream in conduit 102 in the range of from about 25Â°C to about 150Â°C, or about 50Â°C to about 100Â°C from the temperature of the stream when it exits distillation column 16. In general, the temperature of the cooled alcohol-containing stream in conduit 128 can be in the range of from 80Â°C to 170Â°C, about 90Â°C to about 150Â°C, or 100Â°C to 125Â°C.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the cooled alcohol-containing stream in conduit 128 enters a fluid inlet 52 of paste tank 50.  Solid acid particles (i.e., particles of terephthalic acid) in conduit 130 can be introduced into paste tank 50 via upper acid inlet 54.    A mechanical agitator 58 thoroughly mixes the solid acid particles and the alcohol-containing stream in order to produce a paste comprising in the range of from about 30 to about 99 weight percent solids, about 50 to about 90 weight percent solids, or 55 to 85 weight percent solids.   Hot paste having a temperature in the range of from about 80Â°C to about 170Â°C, about 90Â°C to about 150Â°C, or 100Â°C to 125Â°C exits lower paste outlet 56 of paste tank 50 and enters conduit 108.    In one embodiment, esterification system 10 can employ a temperature control system 60 to ensure the hot paste in conduit 108 is maintained at the proper temperature. Temperature   control   system  60   can   be   operable   to   modify   the temperature of the hot paste in conduit 108 by adjusting amount of cooling provided by indirect heat exchange means 48 to the alcohol-containing stream in conduit 128. For example, if the temperature of the hot paste in conduit 108 is higher than desired, temperature indicator 62 sends   a   signal   64  to   indirect  heat  exchange   means  48,   which subsequently increases the amount of cooling provided to the alcohol containing stream in conduit 102 to thereby ultimately decrease the temperature of the hot paste in conduit 108.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 1, the hot paste in conduit 108 can be added to  recirculation  loop   18  downstream  of the  additional  alcohol  and<br>
additive injection points. Further, it can be advantageous to introduce the paste into the top portion of recirculation conduit 100 in order to expedite the dissolution of the solid acid reactant as it descends into the recirculation stream. The presence of polyester monomers and/or oligomers in the recirculation stream can also enhance the dissolution of the solid acid particles added to recirculation conduit 100. In one embodiment of the present invention, the stream in recirculation conduit 100 can have an average chain length in the range of from about 1 to about 20, about 2 to about 18, or 5 to 15.<br>
Conventional esterification systems require substantial cooling of the acid-containing paste prior to introduction into the recirculated ester product stream. However, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when combined with the recirculated esterification product stream flowing through conduit 116 in recirculation conduit 100, the temperature of the acid containing paste is at least about 25Â°C, at least about 40Â°C, or at least 50Â°C cooler, but not more than about 100Â°C, not more than about 75Â°C, not more than 60Â°C, cooler than the temperature of the alcohol stream when it was withdrawn from lower outlet 46 of distillation column 16. In one embodiment, the temperature of the acid-containing paste when combined with the recirculated ester product stream in recirculation conduit 100 is in the range of from about 80Â°C to about 170Â°C, about 90Â°C to about 150Â°C, or 100Â°C to 135Â°C.<br>
