PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
FABRIC CONDITIONER COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN    LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,     165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
	The following specification describes the invention<br>
[1 0 FEB 2006<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a fabric conditioner composition. The invention particularly relates to a liquid fabric conditioner composition suitable for use during first rinse.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Fabric conditioners are well known in the art. Conventionally, during regular washing process, fabrics are rinsed 3 to 4 times and fabric conditioner is added in the last rinsing cycle. Rinsing consumes a lot of fresh water which is globally becoming a scarce and premium resource in view of limited availability and increasing usage.<br>
Rinsing is a tedious process particularly in hand washing. Fabric conditioners that can be added during the first rinse cycle not only deliver benefits of regular fabric softening or conditioning but also help in eliminating the subsequent rinses and consequently reduce time of washing and consumption of water and energy. There is an unmet consumer need for fabric conditioners that eliminate repeat rinsing and avoid subsequent rinses by using the conditioner in the first rinse itself. This will offer speed, economy and convenience besides being environment friendly.<br>
US6110886 describes solid cast fabric softening composition comprising di-hydrogenated tallow di-methyl ammonium chloride, citric acid and silicone emulsion antifoam. It does not describe specific mixtures of cationic fabric conditioner active and anion quencher.<br>
EP1149891 (Goldschmidt Chemical Company, 2001) describes aqueous laundry detergent composition comprising a blend of quaternary ammonium fabric softener actives 1-50% by weight of at least one anionic scavenger and 50-99% by weight of at least on triglyceride based ester quat. Use of organic acid is not described.<br>
2<br><br>
Fabric softening composition comprising cationic fabric conditioning active and acids including citric acid are described in DE3312328 and EP0404471. US20030228992 describes a granular laundry detergent composition comprising a silicone antifoam in addition. However, they do not describe particular combinations of cationic active and anion quencher.<br>
There is no single prior art that describes fabric conditioner composition comprising fabric conditioner active, anion quencher and organic acid. None of the prior art cited above is directed towards eliminating the need for repeat rinses or avoiding subsequent rinses by using fabric conditioner during the first rinse itself.<br>
Therefore one of the objects of the present invention is to formulate a fabric conditioner composition that gives improved fabric softening performance when added in the first rinse cycle itself, eliminating the need for repeat rinsing and avoiding subsequent rinsing, thus offering speed, economy and convenience. Thus the composition economises the use of water, energy and effort and also reduces the quantity of discharge and the pH of the discharge is below 8 which makes it environment-friendly.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to formulate fabric conditioner composition that can be used in machine wash as well as hand wash.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to formulate a fabric conditioner composition that provides fabric softening even when the initial pH of the rinse liquor is above 8.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to formulate a fabric conditioner composition that gives better fragrance retention on the fabric.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly found that by using a combination of cationic active along with an anion quencher and an organic acid, it has been possible to formulate a fabric conditioner composition that can be added during the<br>
3<br><br>
first rinse itself to provide improved fabric softening and enable retention of fragrance on the fabric.<br>

Examples<br>
Fabric conditioner composition of the present invention will now be exemplified by a few non-limiting examples. Following ingredients were used in the examples<br>
Table 1: List of ingredients used in examples<br><br>

Antifoam agent	SE-47	Wacker<br>
Fragrance	-	IFF<br>
All the compositions in the examples described in following tables were prepared according to the following process. Demineralized (DM) water was heated to about 60°C and all ingredients except the fabric conditioning active and fragrance were added to the DM water at about 60°C and a premix was prepared. In a separate vessel, conditioner active was heated to about 80°C, and was slowly added to the premix under stirring and the stirring was continued for 20 minutes. In those examples where fragrance was present, it was added after cooling the final mix to about 45°C.<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Examples A, B and C<br>
Composition according to the invention and comparative examples are presented in Table 2. The compositions were tested for determining the effect on fabric softness and pH when added during the first rinse. The methodology used for evaluation is presented below.<br>
Methodology of performance evaluation:<br>
Fabrics were washed in washing machine using at a cloth to liquor ratio of 10 using commercially available powder detergent (Surf Excel, India) dosed at 5 g/L. Fabric conditioner composition described in Table 1 was evaluated by adding it during the<br>
13<br><br>
first rinse cycle at a dosage of 2.5 g/L Fabrics were kept for 10 minutes in the rinse solution, followed by squeezing and line drying.<br>
The effect of the composition on fabric softness was evaluated using a trained panel of 10 persons who scored based on a scale of 0-10 (scores of 0 and 10 indicating the harshest and the softest feel, respectively). A softness score above 2.3 is satisfactory whilst a score below 2.3 is not acceptable.<br>
pH of the final rinse liquor is measured by using a pH meter. Final liquor pH of less than 8 is satisfactory whilst pH above 8 is not satisfactory from consumer hand-feel and environmental point of view. Initial pH was greater than 8 for all examples.<br>
Table 2<br><br>
Ingredient (% by weight)	Ex 1	Ex A	Ex B	Ex C<br>
Arquad 2HT	7.5	7.5	7.5	-<br>
BKC	3	3	-	3<br>
Citric Acid	5	-	5	5<br>
Water and minor ingredients	To 100	To 100	To 100	To 100<br>
Fabric Softness	3.2	2.6	2.1	1.7<br>
PH	6.9	8.9	6.9	6.9<br>
It is clear from the above result that both fabric softness and pH of Ex 1 are within acceptable range. In case of comparative examples A, B and C, the fabric softness score is less than the Fabric softness score of Example Ex 1. pH of the final rinse for Comparative Example Ex A is higher than acceptable value of 8, whilst softness scores of comparative Examples Ex B and Ex C are too low.<br>
Example 2 and Comparative Examples A', B' and C<br>
Composition according to the invention and comparative examples are presented in Table 3.    The compositions were tested for determining the effect on fabric<br>
