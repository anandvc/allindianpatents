				<td>METHOD OF PREVENTING OR REDUCING<br>
ALDMINOSILICATE SCALE IN A BAYER PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Bayer process is almost universally, used to<br>
manufacture alumina. In this process raw bauxite ore is<br>
first heated with caustic soda solution at temperatures in<br>
the range of 140 to 250Â°C. This results in the dissolution<br>
(digestion) of most of the aluminum-bearing minerals,<br>
especially the alumina trihydrate gibbsite and alumina<br>
monohydrate boehmite, to give a supersaturated solution of<br>
sodium aluminate (pregnant liquor). Resulting<br>
concentrations of dissolved materials are very high, with<br>
sodium hydroxide concentrations being greater than 150<br>
grams/liter and dissolved alumina being greater than 120 g/l.<br>
Any undissolved solids are then physically separated from the<br>
aluminate solution, and a polymeric flocculant is used to<br>
speed the removal of the fine solid particles. Residual<br>
suspended solids are removed by a filtration step. The<br>
filtered clear solution or liquor is cooled and seeded with<br>
alumina trihydrate to precipitate a portion of the dissolved<br>
alumina. After alumina precipitation, this depleted or spent<br>
liquor is reheated and reused to dissolve more fresh bauxite.<br>
Bauxite ores used in the Bayer process also contain<br>
silica in various forms and amounts, depending on the source<br>
of the bauxite. The caustic used to dissolve the aluminum<br>
minerals also dissolves part or all of the silica content of<br>
the bauxite, especially the silica that is present in the<br>
form of aluminosilicate clays. The silica rapidly dissolves<br>
in the digestion step to form solutions that are<br>
supersaturated with respect to silica. This dissolved<br>
silicate reacts relatively slowly with the sodium aluminate<br>
in solution to form complex hydrated sodium aluminum<br>
silicates, generally designated "desilication products." The<br>
principal desilication product is the species known as<br>
sodalite: 3 (Na2O.Al2O3.2SiO2.2H2O)Na2X, where X can be CO3=2,<br>
2Cl-, S04=2, or 2AlO2-. Other related species such as<br>
cancrinite and noselite are also possible, so the more<br>
general terra sodium aluminosilicate is preferred. All of<br>
these desilication products are of low solubility in the<br>
sodium aluminate liquor and largely precipitate out of<br>
solution, thereby removing undesirable silica from the<br>
solution.<br>
The rate at which the desilication products precipitate<br>
out, however, is slow and even when a lengthy<br>
"predesilication" step is used, concentrations of dissolved<br>
silica remain well above equilibrium values. Some of this<br>
silica subsequently precipitates with the precipitated<br>
alumina and contaminates the alumina. Even after the alumina<br>
precipitation step, silica concentrations are still above<br>
equilibrium values in the so-called "spent liquor", and<br>
because of the reduced aluminum concentrations, the silica<br>
becomes easier to precipitate out, in the form of sodalite<br>
and related minerals. An essential part of the Bayer process<br>
is to reheat this spent liquor so that it can be used to<br>
digest more bauxite ore. In the heat exchangers used to<br>
reheat the liquor, the higher temperatures increase the rate<br>
of aluminosilicate precipitation and as a result,<br>
aluminosilicate deposits as "scale" on the inside walls of<br>
the heat exchangers. The scale has low thermal conductivity<br>
compared to the steel of the walls and heat transfer is<br>
severely reduced as scale builds up. This reduced heat<br>
transfer caused by aluminosilicate scaling is sufficiently<br>
severe that the heat exchange units have to be taken out of<br>
service and cleaned frequently, as often as every one to two<br>
weeks.<br>
Scaling that is related to silica can be minimized to<br>
some extent by a combination of blending bauxite ores with<br>
different silica contents, by optimizing the time and<br>
temperature of the digestion step, and by use of a separate<br>
desilication step. The situation is however complicated by<br>
the fact that silica in the solution or liquor is not<br>
necessarily proportional to the silica in the starting<br>
bauxite. Since the Bayer process is continuous, or cyclical,<br>
silica would continually increase if it were not removed from<br>
the system as aluminosilicate. Some silica is necessary to<br>
increase supersaturation to initiate precipitation of<br>
desilication products. Bayer liquors are always<br>
supersaturated with respect to silica and this excess silica<br>
can readily precipitate as aluminosilicate, especially onto<br>
the inside surfaces of heat exchangers.<br>
There is considerable economic impact of aluminosilicate<br>
scale on alumina production. Cleaning of the heat exchangers<br>
with acid is itself a high maintenance cost. The acid<br>
cleaning also reduces the life of the heat exchangers,<br>
therefore adding cost due to frequent replacement of the heat<br>
exchangers. Moreover, the reduced heat exchanger efficiency<br>
caused by scaling leads to higher demand and cost for energy<br>
in the form of steam. The scaled pipes also result in<br>
decreased flow of liquor and potentially lost production.<br>
Altogether the costs directly due to scaling constitute a<br>
significant portion of the cost of producing alumina.<br>
Scale build up has also been known to be a problem in<br>
boiler water systems and a number of treatments for reducing<br>
scale in boiler water systems have been proposed. In boiler<br>
water systems, pH is generally only 8 to 9 and dissolved<br>
salts are usually not present in concentrations more than<br>
about one to five grams/liter. Exemplary treatments for scale<br>
in boilers include siliconate polymers such as the copolymers<br>
of acrylic acid, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid<br>
(AMPS), and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl-methacrylate as<br>
disclosed by Mohnot (Journal of PPG Technology, 1 (1), (1995)<br>
19-26). These polymers were reported to reduce the amount of<br>
silica gel adhering to the wall of polytetrafluoroethylene<br>
bottles in tests done with 645 ppm SiO2 at pH 8.3 and 100Â°C,<br>
i.e., conditions approximating those in a boiler. A Japanese<br>
patent application (Kurita Water Ind. Ltd., 11-090488 (1999))<br>
also deals with adhesion of silica-type scale in cooling<br>
water or boiler water systems. The compositions disclosed<br>
are vinyl silanol/vinyl alcohol copolymers, which may also<br>
contain, e.g., allyl alcohol or styrene. Tests were done in<br>
water that contained 200 mg/l silica at pH 9.0 and<br>
temperatures of 45-75Â°C. Use of the subject compounds<br>
reportedly led to less silica scale compared to an acrylic<br>
acid-AMPS copolymer.<br>
In boilers the pH is generally quite mild, only 8 to 9<br>
and dissolved salts are usually not present in concentrations<br>
more than about one to five grams/liter. Additionally, scales<br>
formed in boiler water systems consist of primarily amorphous<br>
silica, although other scales such as calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate, etc., are possible. In contrast, the<br>
supersaturated solutions at high temperatures and high pH of<br>
essentially 14, make scaling problems much more serious and<br>
difficult to contend with in plants that carry out the Bayer<br>
process than in boilers. In addition, the concentrations of<br>
dissolved salts (i.e., sodium aluminate, sodium carbonate,<br>
sodium hydroxide, etc.) in the Bayer process are very high,<br>
such that total dissolved salt concentrations are greater<br>
than 200 grams/liter. It is not surprising, therefore, that<br>
the scales that form in the Bayer process are distinctly<br>
different from those that form in boilers and unlike boiler<br>
scales, all Bayer scales contain aluminum, which is expected<br>
because of the high concentrations of aluminum in the Bayer<br>
solutions or liquors. In particular, the aluminosilicate<br>
scales contain equal numbers of aluminum and silicon atoms.<br>
Thus, although there have been treatments available for<br>
boiler scales, there has been limited success in obtaining<br>
methods and/or chemical additives that reduce or eliminate<br>
aluminosilicate scaling in the Bayer processing of alumina.<br>
The earliest attempts appear to be the use of a siloxane<br>
polymer (a silicon-oxygen polymer with ethyl and -ONa groups<br>
attached to the silicons), i.e.,<br>
that reportedly reduced scaling during the heating of<br>
aluminate solutions (V.G.Kazakov, N.G. Potapov, and<br>
A.E.Bobrov, Tavetnye Metally (1979) 43-44; V.G. Kazakov, N.G.<br>
Potapov, and A.E.Bobrov, Tsvetnye Metally (1979) 45-48). It<br>
was reported that at the relatively high concentrations of<br>
50-100 mg/l, this polymer was effective in preventing<br>
decrease of the heat transfer coefficient of heat exchanger<br>
walls. Methods of altering the morphology of aluminosilicate<br>
scales have been disclosed using either amines and related<br>
materials (U.S. Patent Ho. 5,314,626 (1994)) or polyamines or<br>
acrylate-amide polymers (U.S. patent 5,415,782 (1995)).<br>
While these materials were shown to modify the morphology of<br>
the aluminosilicate particles, there were no examples of<br>
reduction in the amount of scaling. Additionally, treatment<br>
concentrations required were quite high, in the range of 5 0<br>
to 10,000 parts per million.<br>
Hence, thus far no economically practical materials or<br>
process has been offered to solve the problem of<br>
aluminosilicate scaling in the Bayer process industry. There<br>
is, in fact, currently no way at all to eliminate<br>
aluminosilicate scaling in the Bayer process. Because of the<br>
severe problems caused by aluminosilicate scaling, it would<br>
be a great benefit to the industry to have a cost-effective<br>
treatment method that would reduce these problems and<br>
expenses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention solves the aforementioned problems<br>
and others by providing materials and a process whereby<br>
polymers with the pendant group or end group containing --<br>
Si(OR)3 (where R is H, an alkyl group, Na, K, or NH4) axe<br>
used to reduce or eliminate aluminosilicate scaling in a<br>
Bayer process. When materials of the present invention are<br>
added to the Bayer liquor before the heat exchangers, they<br>
reduce and even completely prevent formation of<br>
aluminosilicate scale on heat exchanger walls. Moreover, the<br>
present materials are effective at treatment concentrations<br>
that make them economically practical.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a process and<br>
materials for the reduction of aluminosilicate containing<br>
scale in the Bayer process. The process comprises the step of<br>
adding to a Bayer process stream an aluminosilicate<br>
containing scale inhibiting amount of a polymer having<br>
pendant thereto a group or end group containing --si{0R")3<br>
where R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4. The present<br>
inventors have found that the scale reducing or inhibiting<br>
properties of the polymer having a pendant group containing -<br>
-Si (OR")3 where R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4,<br>
attached thereto is not dependant on the configuration and/or<br>
size of the polymer to which the group is attached.<br>
Therefore, any polymer, having the requisite group containing<br>
--Si(OR")3 where R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4<br>
attached thereto should therefore be suitable for use in the<br>
present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the group containing --<br>
Si (OR") a, where R" = H, C1-C3, alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4<br>

urea; R" = no group, O, C1-C10 alkyl, or aryl; and R" = H,<br>
C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4. In one embodiment, the<br>
group is --NH--R--X--R"--Si(OR")3, where R = no group, O, Cl-<br>

aryl, Na, K or NH4. In another preferred embodiment a polymer<br>
according to the formula:<br>
where w = 1-99.9 %, x = 0.1-50%, y = 0-50%, z = 0-50%; and<br>
Q = C1-C10 alkyl, aryl, amide, acrylate, ether, COXR where<br>
X=O or NH and R = H, Na, K, NH4, C1-C10 alkyl or aryl, or any<br>
other substituent; X = NH, NR" or O; R" = C1-10 alkyl, or<br>
aryl; R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4; and<br>
D= NR"2 or OR", with the proviso that all R and R" groups do<br>
not have to be the same is used, wherein a polymer according<br>
to the formula:<br>
where w =1-99.9%, x=0.1-50%, y=0-50%, 2=0-50%; and<br>
Q is phenyl is a specific example.<br>
In another preferred embodiment a polymer according to<br>
the formula:<br>
where x= 1-99%, y=l-99% , z=0.5-20% and M = Na, K, NH4; and<br>
R" = H, Cl-10 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4 is used ; wherein a<br>
polymer according to formula:<br>
where x= 1-99%, y=1-99% , z=0.5-20% is a specific example.<br>
The polymer to which the group is pendant can comprise<br>
at least one nitrogen to which the pendant group is attached.<br>
Exemplary polymers comprising at least one nitrogen to which<br>
the pendant group is attached include, but are not limited<br>
to, a polymer according to the following formula:<br>
where x = 0.1-100%, y = 99.9-0%; and R = no group, C1-C10<br>
alkyl, aryl, or -COX-R" -,where X = O or NH and R" = no group,<br>

the formula:<br>
where x = 0.5-20%, y = 99.5-80% are preferred.<br>
In another embodiment the polymer having a --Si(OR")3<br>
containing pendant group attached thereto is grafted to<br>
another polymer. Exemplary such polymers include, but are not<br>
limited to, polymers of the formulae:<br>
where x = 0.1- 99% (as percentage of monomer units in the<br>

R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4, wherein<br>
is a specific example.<br>
The polymers used in the invention can be made in a<br>
variety of ways. For example, they can be made by<br>
polymerizing a monomer containing the group --Si(OR")3, where<br>
R" = H, C1-C3 alkyl, aryl, Na, K or NH4, such as for example<br>
a silane monomer, or copolymerizing such a monomer with one<br>
or more co-monomers. Suitable silane monomers for use in the<br>
present invention .include, but are not limited to<br>
vinyl trie thoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
allyltriethoxysilane, butenyltriethoxysilane, gama-N-<br>
acrylamidopropyltriethoxysilane, p-triethoxysilylstyrene,<br>
2-(methyltrimethoxysilyl) acrylic acid, 2-<br>
(methyltrimethoxysilyl)-1,4 butadiene, N-<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl-maleiraide and other reaction products of<br>
maleic anhydride and other unsaturated anhydrides with amino<br>
compounds containing the --Si(OR")3 group. These monomers can<br>
be hydrolyzed by aqueous base, either before or after<br>
polymerization. Suitable co-monomers for use in the present<br>
invention include, but are not limited to, vinyl acetate,<br>
acrylonitrile, styrene, acrylic acid and its esters,<br>

polymers can be made in a variety of solvents. Solvents<br>
suitable for such use include, but are not limited to,<br>
acetone, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, etc. In some<br>
cases the polymer is soluble in the reaction solvent and is<br>
recovered by stripping off the solvent. Alternatively, if<br>
the polymer is not soluble in the reaction solvent, the<br>
product is recovered by filtration. Suitable initiators for<br>
use in the present invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
2,2" azobis(2,4-dimethylyaleronitrile) and 2,2-<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, and cumene<br>
hydroperoxide.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, polymers<br>
useful in the invention can be made by reacting a compound<br>
containing a --Si(OR")3 group as well as a reactive group<br>
that reacts with either a pendant group or backbone atom of<br>
an existing polymer. For example, polyamines can be reacted<br>
with a variety of compounds containing --Si(OR")3 groups to<br>
give polymers which can be used for the invention. Suitable<br>
reactive groups include, but are not limited to an alkyl<br>
halide group, such as for example, c.hloropropyl, brotnoethyl,<br>
chloromethyl, and bromoundecyl. The compound containing --<br>
Si(OR")3, can contain an epoxy functionality such as<br>
glycidoxypropyl, 1, 2-epoxyatnyl, 1, 2-epoxydecyl or 3,4-<br>
epoxycyclohexylethyl. The reactive group can also be a<br>
combination of a hydroxyl group and a halide, such as 3-<br>
chloro-2-hydroxypropyl. The reactive moiety can also contain<br>
an isocyanate group, such as isocyanatopropyl, or<br>
isocyanatomethyl that react to form a urea linkage. In<br>
addition, silanes containing anhydride groups, such as<br>
triethoxysilylpropylsuccinic anhydride are suitable for use<br>
in making the polymers for the present invention. The<br>
reactions can be carried out either neat or in a suitable<br>
solvent. In addition, other functional groups such as alkyl<br>
groups can be added by reacting other amino groups or<br>
nitrogen atoms on the polymer with alkyl halides, epoxides or<br>
isocyanates. The polyamines can be made by a variety of<br>
methods. They can be made by a ring opening polymerization<br>
of aziridine or similar compounds. They also can be made by<br>
condensation reactions of amines such as ammonia,<br>
methylamine, dimethylamine, ethylenediamine etc. with<br>
reactive compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane,<br>
epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin and similar compounds.<br>
Polymers containing anhydride groups can be reacted with<br>
a variety of compounds containing -Si(OR")3 to make polymers<br>
suitable for use in the present invention. Suitable<br>
anhydride containing polymers include, but are not limited<br>
to, maleic anhydride homopolymer, and copolymers of maleic<br>
anhydride with monomers such as styrene, ethylene and<br>
methyl vinyl ether. The polymer can also be a graft copolymer<br>
such as poly (1,4-butadiene)-g-maleic anhydride or<br>
polyethylene-g-maleic anhydride and the like. Other suitable<br>
anhydride monomers include, but are not limited to, itaconic<br>
and citraconic anhydrides. Suitable reactive silane<br>
compounds include, but are not limited to ?-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane, bis (gama-<br>
triethoxysilylpropyl)amine, N-phenyl-gama<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane, p-aminophenyltriethoxysilane, 3-<br>
(m-aminophenoxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane, and gama-<br>
aminobutyltriethoxylsilane. Other functional groups can be<br>
added to the polymer by reacting it with amines, alcohols and<br>
other compounds. In a preferred polymer for use in the<br>
present invention, maleic anhydride is the anhydride and the<br>
co-monomer is styrene. A preferred silane is gama-<br>
aminopropyltriethoxysilane. It is also advantageous to react<br>
some of the anhydride groups with another amine such as<br>
diethylamine.<br>
The same type of amino compound containing an --Si(OR")3<br>
group can be reacted with polymers containing a pendant<br>
isocyanate group, such as copolymers of for example,<br>
isopropenyldimethylbenzylisocyanate and vinyl isocyanate,<br>
with co-monomers including, but not limited to, vinyl<br>
acetate, styrene, acrylic acid, and acrylamide. These<br>
polymers can also be reacted with other compounds such as<br>
amines to enhance performance.<br>
Isocyanate functional compounds with an --Si(OR")3<br>
group such as gama-isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane can also<br>
be reacted with polymers containing hydroxyl groups such as<br>
hydrolyzed poly(vinyl acetate) and copolymers of vinyl<br>
acetate with other monomers. Other hydroxyl containing<br>
polymers suitable for use include, but are not limited to,<br>
polysaccharides and polymers containing N-<br>
methylolacrylamide.<br>
In the present process, the amount of polymer added to<br>
the process stream can depend on the composition of the Bayer<br>
liquor involved and generally all that is required is an<br>
aluminosilicate containing scale inhibiting amount thereof.<br>
In general the polymer is preferably added to the process<br>
stream in economically and practically favorable<br>
concentrations. A preferred concentration is one that is<br>
greater than about 0 ppm to about 3 00 ppm, more preferably in<br>
a concentration that is greater than about 0 ppm to about 50<br>
ppm and most preferably the polymer is added to the process<br>
stream in a concentration that is greater than about 0 ppm to<br>
about 10 ppm.<br>
The polymer can be added directly to the apparatus in<br>
which the formation of aluminosilicate containing scale is to<br>
be inhibited- It is preferred, however to add the polymer to<br>
a charge stream or recycle stream or liquor leading to the<br>
particular apparatus. While the polymer can be added to the<br>
Bayer process, stream at any time during the process, it is<br>
preferable to add it at any convenient point in the Bayer<br>
process before or during application of heat. Usually, the<br>
polymer is added immediately before the heat exchangers. The<br>
polymer could also be added, e.g., to the liquor before<br>
alumina precipitation or any other point between the<br>
precipitators and the heat exchangers.<br>
Examples<br>
Test procedure<br>
A synthetic Bayer liquor is made by adding 12 ml of a<br>
sodium silicate solution (27.7 g/l of a sodium silicate<br>
solution that is 28.9% SiO2) to 108 ml of a sodium aluminate<br>
solution that contains sodium aluminate, excess sodium<br>
hydroxide, and sodium carbonate. After mixing, the solution<br>
contains 0.8 g/l SiO2, 45g/l Al2O3, 150 g/l NaOH, and 40 g/l<br>
Na2CO3. If a scale reducing additive is used, it is added<br>
just before the silicate is added to the aluminate solution<br>
(generally the additive is used as a solution containing 1-<br>
10% of active reagent). This solution is put into a<br>
polyethylene bottle along with a strip of pre-weighed clean<br>
mild steel (25 mm x 95 mm) and the sealed bottle is heated<br>
with agitation at 100Â°C for 18 + 2 hours. Eight to twelve<br>
such tests (bottles) are done at one time. At the end of the<br>
18 hours, the bottles are opened, the steel strip is<br>
thoroughly rinsed and dried, and the solution is filtered<br>
(0.45m filter). Considerable aluminosilicate scale is<br>
observed to form on both the steel surface and as loose<br>
aluminosilicate in the liquor (which may have initially<br>
formed on the polyethylene surfaces). The weight gain of the<br>
steel is a measure of the amount of aluminosilicate scaling<br>
(with no additive, the weight gain on the steel is typically<br>
about 30 mg). In the examples below, the weight of scale<br>
formed on the steel strip is expressed as a percentage of the<br>
average weight of scale that formed on two blanks (i.e, no<br>
additive used) that were part of the same set of tests.<br>
Similarly, the total amount of aluminosilicate precipitated<br>
is also a measure of antisealant activity and this may be<br>
expressed as a percentage of the total aluminosilicate that<br>
formed in the two blank experiments that were part of the<br>
same set of tests (with no additive, the total<br>
aluminosilicate precipitated is typically about 150mg).<br>
Comparative Example A 
A commercial sample of potassium methyl siliconate,<br>
similar to the polymer described by Kazakov, et al., is<br>
diluted to 5% polymer in 2% NaOH. It is used in accordance<br>
with the Test Procedure described above with the following<br>
results reported in Table A.<br>
It was observed that operating at this very treatment<br>
concentration is not practical for a commercial operation.<br>
Example 1<br>
A polymer with the structure<br>
(Q is phenyl)<br>
is made as follows: 42 g of a styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA)<br>
copolymer, with a mole ratio of styrene to maleic anhydride<br>
of 2.0, is dissolved in 87 g of acetone. A separate solution<br>
is made with 3.03 g of gama-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 8.02<br>
g of diethylamine and 21 g of acetone. The amine solution is<br>
then added to the polymer solution and allowed to react for<br>
15 minutes at ambient temperature. One hundred eighty<br>
milliliters (180 ml) of deionized (D.I.) water is mixed with<br>
2 0 ml of 2 8% aqueous ammonia and heated to 70Â° C. The aqueous<br>
ammonia is then added to the polymer solution and the mixture<br>
heated to 65Â°C to evaporate the acetone. The result is a<br>
solution containing 23.4% polymer based on the total weight<br>
of SMA. polymer and the two amines. It is tested in<br>
accordance with the Test Procedure described above with the<br>
following results reported in Table B.<br>
Example 2<br>
A 25.0 g aliquot of the polymer solution from Example 1<br>
is added to 200 ml of isopropanol to precipitate the polymer,<br>
which is washed with isopropanol and dried. The dried<br>
polymer contains 0.80% silicon. A 2% solution of the<br>
isolated polymer is made in a mixture of NaOH and aqueous<br>
ammonia. It is tested in accordance with the Test Procedure<br>
with the results reported in Table C.<br>
Comparative Example B<br>
A polymer with the structure<br>
( Q is phenyl)<br>
is made by reacting the same SMA polymer used in Example 1<br>
with diethylamine in acetone and then adding warm aqueous<br>
ammonia to give an aqueous solution containing 23.4%<br>
polymer, which is diluted to 2% polymer with 2% aqueous NaOH.<br>
This is tested in accordance with the Test Procedure with the<br>
results reported in Table D.<br>
Example 3<br>
An amine polymer with the structure<br>
is made as follows: 2.3 g of gama-<br>
isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane is mixed with 20 g of a<br>
polyethyleneimine. After 30 min. at ambient temperature, 1.0 g<br>
of the mixture is diluted to 20.0 g with 2% NaOH. This polymer<br>
solution is tested in accordance with the Test Procedure as<br>
previously described. Results are reported in Table E.<br>
Example 4<br>
A polymer containing the pendant groups<br>
is made from a commercial copolymer of maleic anhydride<br>
grafted onto polybutadiene. (The anhydride equivalent weight<br>
is given as 490.)<br>
Twenty grams (20 g) of the polymer is dissolved in 80 g<br>
of acetone. 0.90 g of aminopropyltriethoxysilane is mixed<br>
with 10 g of acetone. The amine solution is then added to the<br>
polymer solution and allowed to react for 15 minutes at<br>
ambient temperature. 100 ml of D.I. water is mixed with 10<br>
ml of 2 8% aqueous ammonia and heated to 70Â° C. The aqueous<br>
ammonia is then added to the polymer solution and the mixture<br>
heated to 65Â° C to evaporate the acetone. The resulting<br>
aqueous solution contains 15.1% polymer. The solution is<br>
diluted to 5% polymer in 2% NaOH and tested in accordance<br>
with the Test procedure with the following results reported<br>
in Table F.<br>
Example 5<br>
Eighteen (18.00) grams of polyethyleneimine is mixed<br>
with 2.00 grams of chloropropyltrimethoxysilane and the<br>
mixture is heated at 100Â°C for 16 hours to give the product<br>
shown below.<br>
A portion of the product is dissolved in water containing 20<br>
g/l NaOH and this solution is used in accordance with the<br>
Test Procedure described above and the results are reported<br>
in Table G.<br>
Example 6<br>
5.56 g of 50% NaOH is added to a solution consisting of<br>
16.00 g acrylamide and 41.2 g water. 4.00 g<br>
vinyltriethoxysilane is then added. 0.2 g of azobis-<br>
isobutyronitrile in 6 ml ethanol is added and the mixture is<br>
heated at 70Â°C. The resulting polymer is found to contain<br>
silicon as expected from the structure below, following<br>
hydrolysis in NaOH solution, which also converts a majority<br>
of the amide functionality to carboxyl groups:<br>
A solution of this polymer is tested in accordance with the<br>
Test Procedure and the results are reported in Table H.<br>
