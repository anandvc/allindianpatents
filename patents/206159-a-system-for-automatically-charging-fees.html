THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATICALLY CHARGING FEES"<br>
EFKON AG, of Andritzer Reichsstasse 66, A-8045 Graz, Austria,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
A System for Automatically Charging Fees<br>
The invention relates to a system'for automati¬cally charging fees when pre-determined positions are passed, e.g. for collecting road toll or parking fees, comprising a communication device for dedicated short range communication (DSRC) that is intended for an at least temporarily stationary installation, and at least one mobile communication unit for dedicated short range communication (DSRC).<br>
Such a system is disclosed in WO 99/33027 A. In such a system, in particular for collecting tolls' from motor vehicles, so-called "virtual" toll stations are used which enter into a bidirectional communication with vehicle-borne installations when the vehicles pass these stations. Information regarding the position of the vehicles is transmitted to the vehicle-borne device via a system such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), or GPS (Global Positioning System), respec¬tively. The payment procedure is effected by linking the position information and the data stored in a de¬vice. The major disadvantage is that locating the vehi¬cles is relatively imprecise and unreliable, and also the determination and the comparison with the virtual toll station is unsatisfactory; moreover, the devices required for this system are complex and expensive. A quite similar system is described in<br><br>
WO 99/48052 A. This includes an identification of the vehicle-borne communication unit by means of, e.g., a smart card which is.read out upon enquiry by the sta¬tionary toll station, thereby identifying the associ¬ated vehicle. The stationary toll station furthermore communicates with'a central computer system so as to carry out the charging of the fees. However, this is rather complex as regards various identification and communication processes.<br>
Moreover, from WO 99/66455 A a road-borne control for a toll device installed in a vehicle is known. For position determination, a GPS device is provided so that the road-borne control means can be recognized, or identified, respectively, by means of GPS at its re¬spective site of installation.<br>
A special dedicated short range communication method, in particular using microwaves, for communicat¬ing with a vehicle-borne unit (so-called "OBU" - On Board Unit) is disclosed in WO 99/25087 A, wherein a step-wise adjustment of the degree of modulation is ef¬fected in the modulation of a carrier wave. This, too, is a bidirectional communication between stationary in¬stallations (beacons) and vehicle-borne units, wherein nothing is said on obtaining an information regarding the position.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a sys¬tem of the initially defined type which is character-<br><br>
ized by a simple configuration and nevertheless, reli¬able functioning, and which thus is inexpensive and also simple to instal.<br>
The inventive system of the initially defined-type is characterized in that the DSRC communication device provided to be stationarily installed is adapted for transmitting information identifying itself and thus, at least indirectly, its position of installation, to the mobile DSRC communication unit.<br>
In the present system, complex self-locating de¬vices, such as GPS, or GNSS, respectively, and the com-<br>
 plex programs required therefor are not needed, since<br>
the communication devices (called "stationary DSRC com¬munication device" in short hereinafter for the sake of simplicity) provided for the at least temporary sta¬tionary installaltion transmit appropriate identifying, and thus locating, information; this information allows for an unambiguous identification of these stationary communication devices and thus., at least indirectly, their position. The stationary communication devices may work autonomously, or asynchronously, respectively, i.e. they need not be linked in a network, and prefera¬bly they work in a transmission operation only, so that unidirectional DSRC communication will suffice for a position determination or locating procedure. The pres¬ent system is excellently suited to be employed both in open and in closed tolling systems, or also in parking<br><br>
systems, wherein the charging of fees proper, the pay¬ment procedure, as the system operator wishes, may be carried out via the most varying means, such as via cards and card reading machines at gas stations or other payment stations. If the stationary communication devices merely have a transmitter function and thus need not receive any data from the mobile communication units, e.g. in vehicles, they can be constructed in a very simple and thus low-cost manner. Also the omission of memory functions for sensitive data, such as data relating to amounts of fees or vehicle data, contrib¬utes to this.<br>
. Depending on the individual tolling system, the fee determination will be effected when a stationary communication device is passed once, or after two such communication devices have been passed (driving in and out). The corresponding techniques or programs therefor are conventional per se and need not be further ex¬plained, here. If tolls or the like are collected, it may be suitable if the stationary DSRC communication device additionally transmits position information re¬garding its site of installation together with the in¬formation clearly identifying itself. Depending on the system of collecting fees, the position information may, e.g., consist in indicating numbers or the like designating the respective stationary communication de¬vice, wherein during the fee calculation the respective<br><br>
positions can be concluded from these numbers and the amount of fees can be determined accordingly. Particu¬larly in the case of collecting parking fees when vir¬tual parking place "barriers" are passed which are formed by stationary DSRC communication devices, it is furthermore advantageously provided that the DSRC com¬munication device contains a clock (e.g. in a proces¬sor) and transmits information indicating the respective point of time of transmission with the in¬formation clearly identifying itself. Thereby the park¬ing times can be calculated by registering the points of time of driving in and driving out.<br>
To allow for a calculation of the respective fee directly via the mobile DSRC communication unit, it is furthermore advantageous if the stationary DSRC commu¬nication device transmits information regarding fees, e.g. fixed fee data or fee determining regulations, taken from a memory, together with the information identifying itself. The respective amounts of fees can be directly transmitted, or calculating regulations, such as data on the basis of which the fees for the re¬spective case can be taken from tables in the mobile DSRC communication unit, can be transmitted. In this connection it is, therefore, suitable if the mobile DSRC communication unit has an associated fee-calculat¬ing unit - e.g. realized by a processor - for determin¬ing the respective fee on the basis of a fee<br><br>
information transmitted by the stationary DSRC communi¬cation device. The determined fee may then be entered on a value account, e.g. by means of a booking unit, in particular within the mobile, or vehicle-borne, respec¬tively, unit (also called on board unit, OBU), whereby the value account will change its value. A system per se already known e.g. in connection with cellular phones using value cards (SIM cards, or so-called "smart cards") may be used, yet it is also conceivable to deduct the fee from an external account. In case of an additional mobile radio device, this deduction may also occur immeditately over the latter. This will also advantageously be possible if the fee is deducted via a subscriber's meter of a telephone account.<br>
To protect the system from fraudulent access, it is also advantageous if the mobile DSRC communication unit and/or the stationary DSRC communication device has an associated cryptographic unit. This crypto¬graphic unit may provide the respective transmitted in¬formation with a signature, e.g.. If the code or the signature, respectively, changes continually, it will be practically impossible for unauthorized persons to get access to the received information.' Not even the vehicle-borne unit can perform a decoding, and only at the payment procedure proper, e.g. at a payment beacon or at a smart card machine, a hyper-signature calcu¬lated from the various locating signatures will be<br><br>
checked, and only the system operator can determine the genuineness and integrity of the code; subsequently, the' actual amount due will be calculated and, e.g., be deducted from the smart card, wherein it is possible to store time and signature in a log-memory on the smart card, or in the mobile unit (OBU), respectively. The payment procedure proper may occur in various ways, such as when re-charging the smart card on a machine or at an appropriately equipped cash desk terminal, when re-charging the smart card via a cellular telephone system (GSM, UMTS etc.), or when re-charging the smart cards via a DSRC communication system. The crypto¬graphic unit may, in principle, also encode the respec¬tive information transmitted.<br>
As already results from the preceding discussion, it is suitably provided that the mobile DSRC communica¬tion unit has an associated memory for storing the in¬formation transmitted by the stationary DSRC communication device. For a possible direct charging of fees via the stationary devices it has also proven to be suitable,if the mobile DSRC communication unit is equipped with a DSRC transmitter, and the DSRC communi¬cation device is equipped with a DSRC receiver, and the DSCR communication device has an associated fee charg¬ing unit.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if the mobile DSRC communication unit has an associated mobile radio de-<br><br>
vice. Here it is conceivable and often suitable with a view to a high flexibility of the system, if the mobile DSRC communication unit is in connection with the mo¬bile radio device via at least one monodirectional, preferably bidirectional, DSRC communication equipment. On the other hand, it is advantageous for obtaining a compact OBU, if the mobile DSRC communication unit is directly connected in one unit with the mobile radio device, preferably shares one housing therewith.<br>
For checking purposes and for determining statis¬tics, it may, furthermore, also be suitable if the mo¬bile radio device is adapted for transmitting information to a central data processing machine. Op¬tionally, this radio transmission may also be used for the charging of fees via the central data processing machine.<br>
To provide further functions, it is advantageously provided that the mobile radio device is a cellular phone with a hands-free talking device. The electric point of connection (e.g. a plug) between the mobile radio device, i.e. the cellular phone, and the hands-free talking device may be adapted such that the mobile DSRC communication unit can be connected at 'this point of connection. This communication connection maybe maintained when the connection for the hands-free talk¬ing device is not in use.<br>
Particularly for enabling a simple updating of the<br><br>
information at the respective stationary DSRC communi¬cation devices, it is, moreover,, advantageous if the stationary DSRC communication device has an associated mobile radio device.<br>
The stationary DSRC communication devices may be equipped with separate batteries, and in principle also connections to the power mains may be provided with ap¬propriate supply units. For an autonomous energy sup¬ply, the respective stationary communication device preferably is provided with a solar energy device as a power supply. The solar energy in this instance is sup¬plied to a chargeable battery.<br>
For a faultless functioning it has proven particu¬larly suitable if the DSRC communication device or the DSRC communication unit is designed with an infrared transmitting, or receiving device, respectively.<br>
It is also advantageous if the DSRC communication<br>
device is adapted to carry out a self-test, e.g. for<br>
checking the power supply, or the functioning of the<br>
communication device, respectively. In case a malfunc¬<br>
tion is determined at a self-test, optionally a mal¬<br>
function report can be delivered to a central<br>
monitoring site, if a radio device comprising an emer¬<br>
gency power supply is provided.	 <br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in more detail by way of preferred exemplary embodi¬ments illustrated in the drawings to which, however, it<br><br>
shall not be restricted. In detail, in the drawings<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows the present system in an embodiment for collecting road tolls, wherein a toll road is illustrated in a schematic top view, showing two vehicles, as well as the system components provided at a "virtual toll-collecting site", and, moreover, a vehicle-borne unit is separately illustrated;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic block diagram of the pre¬sent system;<br>
Fig. 3 schematically illustrates a cellular phone forming part of the vehicle-borne installation and in¬cluding a hands-free talking device and a DSRC communi¬cation unit; and<br>
Fig. 4 shows a flow chart illustrating .the carry¬ing out of a self-test for the stationary communication device.<br>
In Fig. 1, a road toll system is schematically shown as the preferred exemplary embodiment of the sys¬tem of the invention, wherein a toll road 1 is illus¬trated on which vehicles 2 are to be sensed for collecting a toll. For this purpose, the present fee-charging system comprises vehicle-borne units 3, with such a vehicle-borne unit 3 being separately shown in a block illustrated with broken lines for a better illus¬tration; moreover, the system includes at least tempo¬rarily stationarily installed locating beacons 4 equipped with DSRC communication devices. These beacons<br><br>
4 may be stationarily mounted, such as on columns an¬chored in the ground, yet also mobile beacons may be used which can be transported to the toll road as re¬quired and temporarily set up there in a stationary manner.<br>
The (temporarily) stationary DSRC communication devices, termed stationary beacons 4 in short hereinaf¬ter for the sake of simplicity, preferably, are equipped with infrared transmission devices 5 which, with their emitted infrared signals (information A), cover a sec¬tor-shaped locating range 6 extending over only a few meters.<br>
Instead of the infrared transmission devices 5, of course, also conventional microwave or radio transmis¬sion devices as such are conceivable providing a commu¬nication merely in a close range. With a view- to the fact that infrared radiation is incoherent, and thus will not result in an extinction by a superposition of signals, in the present case the infrared transmission is preferred over the other possible modes of transmis¬sion.<br>
In corresponding manner, the vehicle-borne units 3 contain a (mobile) DSRC communication unit, in particu¬lar with a suitable infrared receiver, cf., e.g. also WO 99/03218 A, in which an example of a suitable IR re¬ceiver is shown, and this mobile DSRC communication unit is illustrated at 7 in Fig. 1.<br><br>
In a minimum configuration, the system accordingly is equipped only with transmitting stationary DSRC transmission beacons 4 as well as with receiving mobile DSRG communication units 7, these mobile communication units 7 optionally having an associated fee calculation and booking unit 8, as is schematically shown in Fig. 1. This booking unit 8 may be realized by a processor in a per-se conventional manner. The mobile DSRC commu¬nication unit 7 may also be equipped with a crypto¬graphic unit or an encoding unit not illustrated in detail in Fig. 1, yet cf. Fig. 2, where such a crypto¬graphic unit' is shown at 9. This cryptographic unit 9 serves, e.g., to provide the information or data to be transmitted or received, which are transmitted by the stationary beacon 4, with a continually changing signa¬ture so as to make the system safe from unauthorized access. In the vehicle-borne unit 3 (commonly termed OBU, On Board Unit) there is no decoding means, and de¬coding will occur only at the actual payment procedure, e.g. at a payment beacon or a conventionally designed smart card machine, where a "hyper-signature" calcu¬lated from the various locating "signatures" by the OBU will be checked and used as a basis for fee payment. Only thesystem operator with his corresponding devices will be capable of determining the authenticity and in¬tegrity of the encoded information.<br>
For instance, the OBU 3 itself will determine the<br><br>
respective charge due, from the beacon locating data received and from data stored therein in a. memory not illustrated in detail and associated to a microproces¬sor 8 and regarding the vehicle category etc., of. the information flow denoted by B in Figs. 1 and 2. Then this fee will be deducted from a value account provided in the OBU 3, wherein the value account may, e.g., be realized by a value card, i.e. a smart card or a SIM card, or by a chip.<br>
In the preferred exemplary embodiment illustrated, a mobile radio device is additionally provided in the respective vehicle, as is illustrated at 10 in Figs. 1 and 2 . This mobile radio device 10. may be formed by a substantially conventional cellular phone (GSM, UMTS etc.), and it may be provided separately from the OBU 3 proper or combined into a unit therewith. Preferably, the OBU 3 and the mobile radio device 10 may even share one housing, wherein components usable by both, such as processors, may be used even though a separate proces¬sor 11 (with a memory 11') is shown for the mobile ra¬dio device 10 in Figs. 1 and 2, which processor is connected to a SIM card unit 12. The radio transmission unit proper for transmitting and receiving is illus¬trated at 13 in Fig. 2..<br>
If it is a separate unit, the mobile radio device 10 receives signals or information C supplied by the OBU 3, e.g. via a DSRC system or via a connecting line,<br><br>
as is schematically shown at 14 in Fig. 2. If these two<br>
units 3 and 10 share one housing, the connecting line<br>
14 in the housing interior may be short, it may, e.g.,<br>
be provided on a common printed circuit board. Above<br>
all, in that case also the processors 8 and 11 may be<br>
realized by one single processor.	. .<br>
As is, moreover, apparent from Figs. 1 and 2, a central data processing machine 15 may be provided which is adapted to convey information Q to the sta¬tionary beacons 4, on the one hand, and to at least re¬ceive information D from the vehicle-borne units 3, on the other hand. In detail, the central data processing device 15 may transmit data or information Q provided with the appropriate address codes to the stationary beacons 4 so as to update data stored there., e.g. re¬lating to position, tariff of charges, points of time etc.. It may, moreover, be also provided that informa¬tion, such as on the incident traffic (by counting the passing vehicles)is transmitted by the stationary bea¬cons 4 to the central data processing machine 15.<br>
On the other hand, the information flow D from the vehicle-borne units -3 to the central data processing device 15 may, e.g., contain data for checking the fees charged or actual information regarding the fees. The locating information A which is transmitted from the beacons 4 to the vehicles 2 or to the vehicle-borne units 3, contains data clearly identifying the respec-<br><br>
tive beacon 4 so as to allow for an unambiguous locat¬ing or position determination of the vehicles 2.<br>
To activate the respective communication device 5 (with the infrared transmittor),  as is apparent in de¬tail in Fig. 2, the stationary beacons 4 comprise a processor 16 (e.g. uP microprocessor) with an associ¬ated,, merely schematically illustrated memory 16' which contains the respective identifying or position infor¬mation. Processor 16 also activates a radio device 17 which carries out the transmission of the information Q to, and from, respectively,' the central data processing device 15. Furthermore, the processor 16 contains a clock 16" so that also information indicating the re- • spective time of transmission can be co-transmitted.<br>
For an autonomous energy supply of the individual' components of the stationary beacons 4, preferably a solar cell device 18 is provided to which an appropri¬ately chargeable battery with a charging device (not illustrated) is associated in a conventional manner; such solar energy devices are sufficiently known, thus not requiring any further description thereof.<br>
Although a solar power supply has just been men-tioned, a conventional mains may, of course, be pro¬vided just as well.<br>
"As is apparent, the beacons 4 are extremely simple in their structure, which is due to the fact that, as far as the communication with the vehicles 2 is con-<br><br>
cerned, they need only have a transmitter function, so that they need not receive any data from the vehicles 2. This also does away with the necessity of storing such sensitive date as amounts of fees and vehicle data, making things easier also in this respect. The infrared transmitting unit may be designed in a per-se conventional manner with infrared transmitting diodes and an optical focussing.unit; processor 16 forms the control electronic including the memory 16', and the radio device 17 may, e.g., be a GSM transmitter/re¬ceiver for remote service and remote administration. It is, as such, also conceivable to built up a bidirectional connection for the OBU 3 to the beacons 4, in which case the beacons 4 can be appropriately equipped so as to receive vehicle and fee data, respec¬tively, and to transmit them to the central data proc¬essing device 15. In the preferred embodiment, however, the beacons 4 are merely equipped for transmission op¬eration, as mentioned before, the continuous transmis¬sion of information clearly identifying the respective beacons 4 (information A) being considered as essen¬tial. The beacons 4 thus may operate completely autono¬mously and asynchronously, and due to the transmitted information A, they can each be identified for an unam¬biguous locating procedure so as to carry out the nec¬essary calculation of fees.<br>
If the stationary beacons 4 are to be associated<br><br>
to a parking area and parking fees are to be charged, information A may, as has been mentioned, also co-transmit information regarding the respective time of passage of the vehicle so as to enable a calculation of the duration of .parking. Such time information may also be useful in tolling systems - e.g. for checking pur¬poses - so that also there they are preferably co-transmitted.<br>
Moreover, the transmitted information A may al¬ready contain a fee information, wherein, e.g., data are transmitted on the basis of which the respective fees are determined in the OBU 3 with the assistance of tables stored there, yet it is also possible to di¬rectly transmit the required amounts of fees; the lat¬ter may be particularly advantageously provided in-open toll systems.<br>
According to Fig. 2, the central data processing unit 15 comprises radio devices 19, 20 for the radio communication to the stationary beacons 4 or to the ra¬dio devices 13, respectively, of the OBUs 3. These ra¬dio units 19, 20 are connected to a processor 21, in particular a logfile processor unit, which has an asso¬ciated memory 22 with a data base.<br>
As has already been indicated, in the simplest case the standard OBU 3 may be designed without a mo¬bile radio device 10, wherein it may be equipped with an infrared receiving unit and a smart card, or SIM-<br><br>
card unit, respectively. The OBU 3 may be battery-oper¬ated, and it may, e.g., be fastened by means of a clamp in the region of the interior rearview mirror in the vehicle on the window shield in the top middle part thereof. In this case, no  cables to the electricity of the vehicle are required. All the sensitive data are encoded and stored on the smart card, and this smart card can be read or re-charged, respectively, via com¬mon cash desk terminals and money machines.<br>
As an alternative thereto, it may also be provided that the entire OBU 3 is detached from the attachment on the windshield, and that a smart card chip contained therein in which the sensitive data are stored is re¬charged, or read, respectively, outside of the vehicle, via cash-desk terminals appropriately equipped with an infrared writing/reading head.<br>
In the particularly preferred embodiment, a combi¬nation with a cellular phone (GSM-OBU) is provided, as explained before, and this combined OBU 3 preferably is supplied with power from the car battery. Here, too, preferably all sensitive data are stored encoded on a smart card chip, read-out or charging, respectively, of the same being possible via the cellular telephone net¬work .<br>
The mobile radio device 10 may be equipped with a hands-free talking device, cf. the hands-free talking device connection 23 in Fig. 2, as well as the diagram<br><br>
in Fig. 3 where a cellular phone 10' including a con¬necting plug 24 to a hands-free speaking device 25 is shown; to the connecting plug 24, at the same time the DSRC communication unit 7' is connected, wherein the fee-charging function may also be ensured with the hands-free speaking device 25 connected, by appropriate<br>
programming of processor 11.<br>
f<br>
A further possible modification consists in that<br>
the OBU 3 is temporarily removed from the vehicle 2 and transmits information from outside of the vehicle 2 to a special bidirectional DSRC equipment so as to carry out calculation of fees.<br>
By an appropriate programming (with the program possibly being stored in memory 16'), the processor 16 of the stationary beacons 4 may also be adapted to pe¬riodically carry out a self-test, wherein, i.a., the power supply just as the functioning ability of the transmitting and receiving means proper can be tested;, likewise, the memory 16' itself can be subjected to a test. In case of malfunction, the radio device 17 - if still capable of functioning and equipped with an emer¬gency power supply - may transmit a malfunction report to the central data processing device 15. Alterna¬tively, the system may also be equipped such that the stationary beacons 4 periodically transmit a functional ability report, e.g. every 15 minutes, to the data processing device 15; if this report from the station-<br><br>
ary beacon 4 does not arrive at the pre-determined time, this is recognized by the data processing device as a malfunction of the respective beacon 4 and re¬ported to the monitoring personnel so that a checking and repair may occur on location.<br>
In Fig. 4, the procedure of such a self-test of the stationary beacon 4 is illustrated. In Fig. 4, at 26 the triggering of the self-test is generally inid-cated, while the execution of the test is illustrated at 27. For triggering the test, a time-interval infor¬mation derived from the clock in processor 16 may serve as trigger event, such as "daily 8 o'clock a.m." or "every 15 minutes", this triggering being illustrated at 28 in Fig. 4. At 29 it is furthermore shown that the self-test is triggered from the outside, e.g. by the central data processing device 15. Block 3 0 shall indi¬cate quite generally that also other possible trigger¬ing modes are possible.<br>
When carrying out the test, as indicated at 27 in Fig. 4, at first the voltage supply may be tested, of. block 31 in Fig. 4. Then the transmitting unit proper (cf. pos. 5 in Fig. 2) will be tested, particularly as to which extent the infrared diodes of the transmitting unit are ready for operation (block 32). According to block 33, a test may then be carried out regarding the integrity of memory 16' and processor 16 etc.. At 34 the decision is indicated in Fig. 2, whether the<br><br>
checked units are working (output J) or not (output N). If the result of the test is positive, it is passed on to a loop 35 and it is waited for the next triggering 26 to then again start the self-test at position A'. If a malfunction is found, a report will occur according to block 3 6 to a central maintenance unit, e.g. the ' central data processing device 15 according to Figs. 1 and 2.<br><br>
