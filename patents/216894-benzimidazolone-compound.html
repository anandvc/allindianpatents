BENZIMIDAZOLONE COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to benzimidazolone compounds that provide a<br>
plurality of hues from a single structural formula, and are useful as pigments that offer<br>
superior dispersibility in binder resins.<br>
Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-182574, filed June<br>
26,2003, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In conventional paints containing dispersed pigments, depending on the nature of<br>
the pigment, poor dispersion stability can lead to pigment flocculation, or separation<br>
between the pigment and the binder resin (hereafter referred to as "Varnish separation").<br>
One known method for resolving these problems involves the addition of a pigment<br>
dispersing agent to the paint. However, although pigment dispersing agents improve the<br>
dispersibility of the pigment, they tend to lower the weather resistance and heat<br>
resistance of the paint film, and if the pigment dispersing agent is colored, then achieving<br>
the desired paint hue can also be difficult.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of a paint with an intermediate color, such as a paint with<br>
an intermediate color between red and yellow, pigments of different structural formulas,<br>
such as a red colored diketopyrrolopyrrole based pigment, quinacridone based pigment,<br>
or diaminoanthraquinone based pigment, and a yellow colored azo based pigment,<br>
isoindoline based pigment, or isoindolinone based pigment must be blended together.<br>
Paints containing a plurality of pigments with different structural formulas tend to<br>
be more prone to pigment flocculation and varnish separation than paints that contain<br>
only one pigment. In order to prevent such pigment flocculation, a pigment dispersing<br>
agent must be added to the paint. The most suitable pigment dispersing agent will often<br>
differ for pigments with different structural formulas, meaning that in an intermediate<br>
colored paint containing a plurality of pigments with different structural formulas, a<br>
plurality of pigment dispersing agents are used. However, the most suitable pigment<br>
dispersing agent for one pigment may adversely affect the dispersibility of another<br>
pigment within the paint, thereby causing flocculation and a deterioration in the<br>
dispersion stability. Accordingly, in those cases where a plurality of pigment dispersing<br>
agents are combined, considerable care must be taken with the actual combination used.<br>
Methods of generating an intermediate colored paint that involve the blending of<br>
pigments with similar structural formulas but a plurality of different hues also exist.<br>
Examples of pigments with similar structural formulas but a plurality of differenUiues<br>
include the benzimidazolone based compounds represented by a formula (2) (hereafter<br>
referred to as the "compound (2)") and a formula (3) (hereafter referred to as the<br>
"compound (3)") shown below (see W. Herbst and K. Hunger, "Industrial Organic<br>
Pigments, second completely revised edition" VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, 1997, pp.<br>
345 to 370).<br>
These benzimidazolone based compounds are known to form a red to brown<br>
colored pigment when the molecular structure includes a naphthalene ring (the compound<br>
(2) shown above is red), and a yellow to orange colored pigment when the molecular<br>
structure does nor contain a naphthalene ring (the compound (3) shown above is yellow).<br>
However, even in a paint prepared by blending the structurally similar<br>
compounds (2) and (3), the pigments still tend to flocculate, making it difficult to achieve<br>
the desired hue.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide benzimidazolone compounds that<br>
provide a plurality of hues from a single structural formula, and are useful as pigments<br>
that offer superior dispersibility in binder resins, and to provide benzimidazolone<br>
compounds that are useful as pigments, and show minimal flocculation when two or<br>
more pigments of different hues are blended together to produced a desired hue.<br>
As a result of intensive investigation aimed at achieving the above object, based<br>
on the concept that if a compound with a single structural formula displays a plurality of<br>
different hues, then generating an intermediate color by blending these different hues<br>
should enable suppression of pigment flocculation, the inventors of the present invention<br>
discovered that benzimidazolone compounds with introduced functional groups that<br>
enable the formation, through intramolecular hydrogen bonding, of three six-membered<br>
rings in a planar structure display a plurality of different hues, even with the same<br>
structural formula. In addition, they, also discovered that these benzimidazolone<br>
compounds were able to generate a paint with superior dispersion stability and, no varnish<br>
separation without the addition of pigment dispersing agents both in cases where a<br>
pigment of a single-hue was used, and in cases where pigments with different hues were<br>
blended together.<br>
In other words, the present invention provides a benzimidazolone compound<br>
represented by a general formula (1) shown below.<br>
(wherein, R1, R2, R3 and R4 each represent, independently, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and R5 and R6<br>
each represent, independently, an alkyl group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms.)<br>
The benzimidazolone compounds represented by the general formula (1) display<br>
excellent dispersion stability even without the addition of a pigment dispersing agent,<br>
meaning they are ideal as colored pigments for printing inks, paints, colorants for various<br>
plastics, toner, inkjet inks, and color filters and the like. The compound in which the<br>
groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 in the above general formula (1) are all hydrogen atoms, and the<br>
groups R5 and R6 are both methyl groups, while representing a single structural formula,<br>
displays a variety of different hues including vivid red, yellow, reddish purple, and bluish<br>
red, depending on certain variations in the crystal structure, and is consequently<br>
particularly preferred. Because these pigments provide superior suppression of pigment<br>
flocculation they are extremely useful, regardless of whether a single pigment is used, or<br>
two or more pigments with different hues are blended together to generate an<br>
intermediate color.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Synthetic Method 1<br>
A benzimidazolone compound of the general formula (1), in which R1 and R4<br>
represent the same group, and R2 and R3 represent the same group, can be prepared by<br>
reacting 1 equivalent of a compound represented by a general formula (4) shown below<br>
(hereafter referred to as the "compound (4)"), 1 equivalent of a compound represented by<br>
a general formula (5) shown below (hereafter referred to as the "compound (5)"), and 1<br>
equivalent of a compound represented by a general formula (6) shown below (hereafter<br>
referred to as the "compound (6)") in an aprotic polar solvent such as l,3-dimethyl-2-<br>
imidazolidinone, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, or N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone, in the presence of an acid such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, or<br>
phosphoric acid, for 8 to 14 hours at a temperature of 150 to 180°C, and then cooling the<br>
reaction mixture to room temperature, and filtering, washing, drying, and crushing the<br>
precipitated crystals using normal methods.<br>
(wherein, R3 and R4 each represent, independently, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group of 1<br>
to 5 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms.)<br>
Synthetic Method 2<br>
A benzimidazolone compound of the general formula (1), in which R1 and R4<br>
represent different groups, or R2 and R3 represent different groups, can be prepared under<br>
the same reaction conditions as the synthetic method 1 described above, by first reacting<br>
1 equivalent of the compound (4) and 1 equivalent of the compound (5), subsequently<br>
reacting the resulting reaction product with the compound (6), and then cooling the<br>
resulting product to room temperature, and filtering, washing, drying, and crushing the<br>
precipitated crystals using normal methods.<br>
Of the compounds represented by the general formula (1), a compound of the<br>
general formula (1) represented by a formula (7) shown below (hereafter referred to as<br>
the "compound (7)"), in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 all represent hydrogen atoms, and R5<br>
and R6 both represent methyl groups, enables the preparation of 4 different crystal types,<br>
namely a-type crystal, b-type crystal, g-type crystal and D-type crystal described below,<br>
all with the same structural formula, and is consequently preferred.<br>
(a-type crystal)<br>
(1) X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
Displays diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of<br>
9.9 ± 0.2°, 12.8 ± 0.2°, 15.0 ± 0.2°, and 25.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
(2) Hue<br>
A vivid red color.<br>
(3) Production method<br>
Can be produced using the synthetic method 1 described above.<br>
(P-type crystal)<br>
(1) X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
Displays diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of<br>
14.3 ± 0.2°, 16.6 ± 0.2°, 24.2 ± 0.2°, and 24.8 ± 0.2°.<br>
(2) Hue<br>
A vivid yellow color.<br>
(3) Production method<br>
Heating the above a-type crystal in N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature of<br>
60 to 120°C causes the red crystals to gradually change color to yellow crystals. After<br>
heating for at least 6 hours, the P-type crystal can be obtained by cooling the mixture to<br>
room temperature, and filtering, washing, and drying the crystals using normal methods,<br>
(g-type crystal)<br>
(1) X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
Displays diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of<br>
9.9 ± 0.2°, 14.3 ± 0.2°, 16.3 ± 0.2°, 24.5 ± 0.2°, and 26.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
(2) Hue<br>
A vivid reddish purple color.<br>
(3) Production method<br>
The Y-type crystal can be obtained by grinding and mixing the above a-type<br>
crystal, together with a water-soluble inorganic salt such as sodium chloride or sodium<br>
sulfate as a grinding medium, and a liquid grinding auxiliary agent such as diethylene<br>
glycol, using a device that applies a mechanical shearing force to the mixture such as a<br>
ball mill, an atriter, a vibration mill, or a kneader, subsequently peptizing the ground<br>
mixture using a solvent that dissolves the grinding medium and the liquid grinding<br>
auxiliary agent but does not dissolve the crystals, and then filtering, washing, drying, and<br>
crushing the crystals using normal methods.<br>
(8-type crystal)<br>
(1) X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
Displays diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 26 of<br>
12.8 ± 0.2°, 15.8 ± 0.2°, 25.0 ± 0.2°, and 26.5 ± 0.2°.<br>
(2) Hue<br>
A vivid bluish red color.<br>
(3) Production method<br>
The 8-type crystal can be obtained by dissolving the above a-type crystal, b-type<br>
crystal, or g-type crystal in concentrated sulfuric acid, pouring the solution into ice water<br>
to effect re-precipitation, thus precipitating bluish red crystals, and then filtering the<br>
bluish red colored slurry, and washing, drying, and crushing the crystals using normal<br>
methods.<br>
The reason that the four crystal types described above have mutually different<br>
hues is not understood in great detail, although it is surmised that the following factors<br>
are significant.<br>
The compound (7) comprises a single aromatic ring at the center of the structure.<br>
If the two amino groups and the carbonyl groups of the two carboxylate ester groups<br>
bonded to this aromatic ring form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, then a structure is<br>
formed in which three six-membered rings, including the central aromatic ring, are<br>
aligned in sequence (see formula (8) below). The plane formed by these three six-<br>
membered rings represents a chromophore, and is believed to be responsible for<br>
generating the hue of the red based crystals (the a-type crystal, y-type crystal, and 8-type<br>
crystal).<br>
Furthermore, the reason that the hue differs between the a-type crystal, the g-type<br>
crystal, and the 8-type crystal is thought to be due to the fact that the angle between the<br>
plane formed by the three six-membered rings, including the central aromatic ring,<br>
formed as a result of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and the plane of the<br>
benzimidazolone groups, varies in the different crystal types as a result of rotation about<br>
the bonds indicated by the arrows "A" in the above formula (8).<br>
On the other hand, it is believed that if the intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed<br>
between the two amino groups and the carbonyl groups of the two carboxylate ester<br>
groups are broken by heating within an organic solvent, then the portion of the molecule<br>
that forms the plane representing the chromophore in the center of the molecule is<br>
reduced to just the central aromatic ring, meaning its contribution as a chromophore<br>
diminishes, thus yielding crystals with a yellow hue (the P-type crystal).<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
As follows is a more detailed description of the present invention, based on a<br>
series of examples. Unless stated otherwise, the units "parts" and"%" in the examples<br>
refer to weight referenced values.<br>
Example 1<br>
43.6 parts of 5-aminobenzimidazolone, 30 parts of dimethylsuccinyl succinate,<br>
and 13.4 parts of concentrated sulfuric acid were added to 750 parts of l,3-dimethyl-2-<br>
imidazolidinone, and the resulting mixture was heated for 14 hours at 180°C. Following<br>
cooling to room temperature, the precipitate was filtered, washed with 200 parts of 1,3-<br>
dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and 600 parts of acetone to remove impurities, and then<br>
dried under reduced pressure for 8 hours at 110°C, thus yielding 17.7 parts (yield 28%)<br>
of vivid red colored a-type crystal. When these red a-type crystal were analyzed by<br>
infrared spectroscopy and field desorption mass spectrometry (FD-MS), the following<br>
results were obtained.<br>
Infrared Spectroscopy<br>
Infrared spectroscopic analysis using a Fourier transform infrared<br>
spectrophotometer FT7IR-550 manufactured by Jasco Corporation revealed absorption<br>
peaks due to the following stretching vibrations.<br>
3200 cm"1: N-H stretching vibration for the amide groups within the imidazolone rings<br>
1720 cm"1: C=O stretching vibration for the methyl esters.<br>
1695 cm"1: C=O stretching vibration within the imidazolone rings.<br>
1220 cm"1: C-0 stretching vibration for the methyl esters.<br>
Field Desorption Mass Spectrometry (FD-MS)<br>
Field desorption mass spectrometric analysis using a (double focus type) gas<br>
chromatograph mass spectrometer GCMS 9100MK manufactured by Shimadzu<br>
Corporation detected a molecular ion peak at a molecular weight of 488.<br>
The results of the above analyses identified the red a-type crystal obtained in the<br>
example 1 as crystals of the aforementioned compound (7).<br>
In addition, a powder X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu-Ka X-ray radiation was<br>
also conducted on the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1, using an X-ray<br>
diffraction apparatus RINT Ultima+ manufactured by Rigaku Corporation, and under the<br>
conditions listed below.<br>
Power: 40 kV, 30 mA<br>
Sampling angle: 0.020°<br>
Divergence/scattering slit: (1/2)<br>
Emission slit: 0.3 mm<br>
Scan speed: 2°/minute<br>
The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained from the above powder X-ray diffraction<br>
analysis is shown in FIG. 1. The red a-type crystal of the compound (7) displayed<br>
diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of 9.9 ± 0.2°, 12.8 ±<br>
0.2°, 15.0 ± 0.2°, and 25.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
Example 2<br>
2 parts of the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1 were added to 10 parts<br>
of N,N-dimethylformamide, and the mixture was heated for 6 hours at 90°C. The<br>
resulting mixture was then cooled to room temperature, the slurry was filtered and<br>
washed with 50 parts of acetone, and the resulting precipitate was then dried under<br>
reduced pressure for 8 hours at 110°C, thus yielding 1.6 parts (yield 80%) of vivid<br>
yellow colored (b-type crystal.<br>
These yellow b-type crystal were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction using the<br>
same method as that described for the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1. The<br>
resulting X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in FIG. 2. The crystals were shown to be<br>
different from the a-type crystal, and displayed diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka<br>
characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 20 of 14.3 ± 0.2°, 16.6 ± 0.2°, 24.2 ± 0.2°, and 24.8<br>
±0.2°.<br>
Example 3<br>
15 parts of the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1,150 parts of table salt,<br>
and 37.5 parts of diethylene glycol were mixed together and ground in a kneader. The<br>
resulting mixture was then peptized in 1000 parts of water at 60°C and subsequently<br>
filtered. A washing process, in which the thus obtained wet cake was peptized in 1000<br>
parts of water at 60°C and then filtered, was repeated 3 times. The washed wet cake was<br>
then dried under reduced pressure for 8 hours at 110°C, thus yielding 13.5 parts (yield<br>
90%) of vivid reddish purple colored y-type crystal.<br>
These reddish purple g-type crystal were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction<br>
using the same method as that described for the red a-type crystal obtained in the<br>
example 1. The resulting X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in FIG. 3. The crystals were<br>
shown to be different from both the a-type crystal and the b-type crystal, and displayed<br>
diffraction peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 20 of 9.9 ± 0.2°, 14.3 ±<br>
0.2°, 16.3 ± 0.2°, 24.5 ± 0.2°, and 26.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
Example 4<br>
2 parts of the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1 were dissolved in 10<br>
parts of concentrated sulfuric acid (sulfuric acid concentration of at least 95%). The<br>
resulting sulfuric acid solution was then poured into 100 parts of water, thus precipitating<br>
red crystals and generating a slurry. The slurry was filtered, and then washed repeatedly<br>
with water until the filtrate became neutral. The washed wet cake was then dried under<br>
reduced pressure for 8 hours at 110°C, yielding 1.8 parts (yield 90%) of bluish red<br>
colored d-type crystal.<br>
These bluish red d-type crystal were analyzed by powder X-ray diffraction using<br>
the same method as that described for the red a-type crystal obtained in the example 1.<br>
The resulting X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in FIG. 4. The crystals were shown to<br>
be different from the a-type, b-type, and g-type crystal, and displayed diffraction peaks<br>
for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of 12.8 ± 0.2°, 15.8 ± 0.2°, 25.0 ±<br>
0.2°, and 26.5 ±0.2°.<br>
The hues and Cu-Ka characteristic X-ray peaks for each of the four crystal types<br>
obtained in the above examples 1 to 4 are summarized below in Table 1.<br>
Example 5<br>
66 parts of a mixed resin comprising 70% of a baking paint alkyd resin (product<br>
name: Beckosol J-524-IM-60, manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals,<br>
Incorporated) and 30% of a melamine resin (product name: Super Beckamine G-821-60,<br>
manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Incorporated) was dissolved in 12 parts<br>
of a mixed solvent of xylene:n-butanol = 7:3, thus yielding a binder resin solution.<br>
2 parts of the a-type crystal obtained in the example 1 were added to 78 parts of<br>
this binder resin solution, and the mixture was shaken and dispersed for 2 hours in a paint<br>
conditioner, thus yielding a paint (1).<br>
Example 6<br>
With the exception of replacing the a-type crystal used in the example 5 with the<br>
p-type crystal obtained in the example 2, a paint (2) was prepared in the same manner as<br>
the example 5.<br>
Example 7<br>
5 parts of the paint (1) obtained in the example 5 and 5 parts of the paint (2)<br>
obtained in the example 6 were mixed together, forming 10 parts of a mixed paint (1).<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
With the exception of replacing the a-type crystal used in the example 5 with a<br>
red pigment (product name: Irgazin DPP Red BO (C.I. Pigment Red 254), manufactured<br>
by Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation, hereafter abbreviated as DPP-BO), a paint (3)<br>
was prepared in the same manner as the example 5.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
With the exception of replacing the a-type crystal used in the example 5 with a<br>
red pigment (product name: Novoperm Red HFT (C.I. Pigment Red 175), manufactured<br>

yellow pigment (product name: Symuler Fast Yellow 4192 (C.I. Pigment Yellow 154),<br>
manufactured by Dainippon Ink and Chemicals, Incorporated, equivalent to the<br>
aforementioned compound (3), hereafter abbreviated as 4192), a paint (5) was prepared<br>
in the same manner as the example 5.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
5 parts of the paint (3) obtained in the comparative example 1 and 5 parts of the<br>
paint (5) obtained in the comparative example 3 were mixed together, forming 10 parts of<br>
a mixed paint (2).<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
5 parts of the paint (4) obtained in the comparative example 2 and 5 parts of the<br>
paint (5) obtained in the comparative example 3 were mixed together, forming 10 parts of<br>
a mixed paint (3).<br>
Evaluation of Paint Flocculation<br>
For each of the paints prepared in the above examples 5 to 7 and the comparative<br>
examples 1 to 5, the volumetric average particle size of the pigment within the paint<br>
immediately following preparation was measured using a Microtrac Particle Size<br>
Analyzer UPA150, manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd. Furthermore, the volumetric<br>
average particle size of the pigment within each paint following standing for 1 day at<br>
room temperature was also measured in the same manner. In addition, the difference in<br>
the volumetric average particle size (A average particle size) for each paint was also<br>
calculated by subtracting the value of the volumetric average particle size immediately<br>
following preparation from the value of the volumetric average particle size following<br>
standing for 1 day. This value for A average particle size was used to evaluate the level<br>
of flocculation, based on the following evaluation standards.<br>
A: A average particle size of less than 0.20 mm, B: A average particle size of at<br>
least 0.20 mm<br>
Evaluation of Paint Varnish separation<br>
A sample of each of the paints prepared in the above examples 5 to 7 and the<br>
comparative examples 1 to 5 was placed in a transparent glass sample vial, and allowed<br>
to stand for 2 weeks at room temperature. The samples were then inspected visually for<br>
evidence of varnish separation (separation of the pigment and the resin solution, leading<br>
to the generation of a transparent resin solution layer at the top of the paint sample). The<br>
results obtained were used to evaluate the varnish separation, based on the following<br>
evaluation standards.<br>
A: no varnish separation observed, B: varnish separation observed<br>
The results of the evaluations of each of the paints prepared in the above<br>
examples 5 to 7 and the comparative examples 1 to 5 are summarized below in Table 2.<br>
From the results shown in Table 2, the following observations were made.<br>
From the results for the examples 5 and 6 it is evident that when the a-type<br>
crystal or the b-type crystal of a benzimidazolone compound of the present invention<br>
were used individually within a paint, neither pigment flocculation nor varnish separation<br>
occurred.<br>
From the results for the example 7 it is evident that when a paint containing the<br>
a-type crystal of a benzimidazolone compound of the present invention was mixed with<br>
a paint containing the P-type crystal of the benzimidazolone compound, neither pigment<br>
flocculation nor varnish separation occurred.<br>
From the results for the comparative examples 1,2, and 3 it is evident that when a<br>
conventional pigment such as DPP-BO, HFT, or 4192 was used individually within a<br>
paint, both pigment flocculation and varnish separation occurred.<br>
From the results for the comparative example 4 it is evident that when a paint (3)<br>
containing the conventional pigment DPP-BO was mixed with a paint (5) containing the<br>
pigment 4192, both pigment flocculation and varnish separation occurred.<br>
The comparative example 5 represents an example in which a paint (4) containing<br>
the conventional pigment HFT was mixed with a paint (5) containing the pigment 4192,<br>
which has a similar structural formula to that of HFT, but it is clear that pigment<br>
flocculation and varnish separation still occurred in this example. Furthermore, the<br>
average particle size of the pigment within the paint (4) containing the pigment HFT was<br>
0.87 mm, and the average particle size of the pigment within the paint (5) containing the<br>
pigment 4192 was 1.55 mm, and as a result, it was expected that the average particle size<br>
for the pigment within the mixed paint (3), comprising a mixture of equal quantities of<br>
these two paints, would be the average of these two average particle sizes, namely 1.21<br>
mm. However, the measured value for the average particle size immediately following<br>
mixing of the two paints was 1.89 mm, indicating that pigment flocculation had occurred<br>
immediately upon mixing of the two paints.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Benzimidazolone compounds of the present invention represented by a general<br>
formula (1) display excellent dispersion stability even without the addition of a pigment<br>
dispersing agent, meaning they are ideal as colored pigments for printing inks, paints,<br>
colorants for various plastics, toner, inkjet inks, and color filters and the like. The<br>
compound of the general formula (1) in which the groups R1, R2, R3 and R4 are all<br>
hydrogen atoms, and the groups R5 and R6 are both methyl groups, while representing a<br>
single structural formula, displays a variety of different hues including vivid red, yellow,<br>
reddish purple, and bluish red, depending on certain variations in the crystal structure,<br>
and is consequently particularly preferred. Because these pigments provide superior<br>
suppression of pigment flocculation they are extremely useful, regardless of whether a<br>
single pigment is used, or two or more pigments with different hues are blended together<br>
to generate an intermediate color.<br>
(wherein, R1, R2, R3 and R4 all represent hydrogen atoms, and R5 and R6 both represent<br>
methyl groups).<br>
2. A benzimidazolone compound as claimed in claim 1, which displays diffraction<br>
peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 20 of 9.9 ± 0.2°, 12.8 ± 0.2°, 15.0<br>
± 0.2°, and 25.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
3. A benzimidazolone compound as claimed in claim 1, which displays diffraction<br>
peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 20 of 14.3 ± 0.2°, 16.6 ± 0.2°,<br>
24.2 ±0.2°, and 24.8 ±0.2°.<br>
4. A benzimidazolone compound as claimed in claim 1, which displays diffraction<br>
peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 20 of 9.9 ± 0.2°, 14.3 ± 0.2°, 16.3<br>
± 0.2°/24.5 ± 0.2°, and 26.0 ± 0.2°.<br>
5. A benzimidazolone compound as claimed in claim 1, which displays diffraction<br>
peaks for Cu-Ka characteristic X-rays at Bragg angles 29 of 12.8 ± 0.2°, 15.8 ± 0.2°,<br>
25.0 ±0.2°, and 26.5 ±0.2°.<br>
There are provided benzimidazolone compounds that provide a plurality of hues<br>
from a single structural formula, and are useful as pigments that offer superior<br>
dispersibility in binder resins, as well as benzimidazolone compounds that are useful as<br>
pigments, and show minimal flocculation when pigments of two or more different hues<br>
are blended together to produced a desired hue.<br>
A benzimidazolone compound represented by a general formula (1) shown below.<br>
(wherein, R1, R2, R3 and R4 each represent, independently, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl<br>
group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and R5 and R6<br>
each represent, independently, an alkyl group of 1 to 5 carbon atoms.)</td>
