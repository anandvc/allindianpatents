[Technical Field)<br>
The present invention relates to a method for displaying enlargement<br>
images of an intersection in a navigation device. More particularly, the<br>
present invention is characterized to provide a method for displaying<br>
enlargement photos or three-dimensional images of an intersection in sequence<br>
with different enlargement ratio for each, thereby inqjroving visibility and<br>
accuracy of a navigation device in providing a direction at intersections.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A navigation device is generally stationed in a car or installed on-<br>
board, and serves a driver as a means to check the present location and speed<br>
of a car by receiving precise microwave signals transmitted by plural<br>
satellites utilized by Global Positioning Syston (CPS). It is generally<br>
called "a navigation". Such a navigation device displays on its screen the<br>
present position of a car which is calculated by use of GPS as well as map<br>
data retrieved from the memory device included therein, thereby enabling a<br>
user thereof to know the present location on the map in real time. In<br>
addition, a niavigation device is able to search a path from a departure to a<br>
destination with waypoint data inputted by a user, and has a function to<br>
guide the user therewith by a means of voice or an image.<br>
FIG. 1 is an embodiment of a method for showing an intersection<br>
enlargement image in a conventional navigation device.<br>
A conventional navigation device provides a direction with an enlarged<br>
image at an intersection which is located in the course of a car, while the<br>
device is displaying a desired path on the screen, wherein the enlarged image<br>
can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional.<br>
Conventional methods, however, have limitations in providing an exact<br>
direction at a complex intersection or interchange such as one with a multi-<br>
legs, an on/off-ramp of an expressway or a underpass. Failure to provide a<br>
driver with an exact direction guides the driver into a wrong direction.<br>
Besides, conventional methods have a shortcoming in that it provides an<br>
intersection enlargement image calculating distance-to-go from the car's<br>
present spot without taking into account of the predicted time when to reach<br>
the intersection along with the present speed, thereby guiding a driver<br>
inexactly.<br>
[Disclosure]<br>

problons occurring in the prior art, and it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method for displaying enlargement images of an<br>
intersection in sequence as a vehicle approaches the intersection, thereby<br>
performing path guidance with accuracy and giving a user high sense of<br>
reality.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
displaying enlargement images of an intersection in sequence, thereby<br>
improving visibility in path guidance at an intersection.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
The above object of the present invention can be achieved by a method<br>
for displaying enlargement images of an intersection in a navigation device,<br>
wherein the navigation device finds a path to destination to guide a user<br>
thereof, comprises a first step of calculating distance-to-go from a present<br>
position of a vehicle to an intersection in the path of said vehicle's<br>

[Mode for Invention]<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred onbodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Prior to this, the terms or words used in the specification and claims are<br>
not limited to usual or dictionary meaning, but the present invention should<br>
be understood by the meaning or concepts matching to the technical spirits of<br>
the present invention on the basis of such principles that the scope of the<br>
term can be properly defined to explain the present invention with the best<br>
method by the inventor.<br>
Thus, since the embodiments described in the present specification and<br>
the construction described on the accompanying drawings are only the<br>
preferred embodiments, but do not represent for all technical aspects of the<br>
present invention, it should be understood that various equivalents and<br>
modification examples exist for replacing with the technical aspects of the<br>
present invention at the time of filing the present invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method for displaying intersection<br>
enlargements according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention is implemented by a navigation device, which<br>
finds a path for a user to take and guides the user to the direction when the<br>
user inputs his/her destination therein (S210). The present invention is<br>
especially useful when the driver has to pay attention to which road to take<br>
at an intersection.<br>
Said navigation device can capture the car's present position by<br>
calculating coordinates with satellite signals, which is received by GPS<br>
receiving unit thereof, and a location of an intersection in the track of the<br>
vehicle by use of map data, which is stored in storing unit thereof.<br>
In addition, said navigation device calculates distance-to-go to the<br>
intersection based on the current position of the vehicle and the location of<br>
the intersection, and corrects, by real time calculation, the distance-to-go<br>
in constant change as the car approaches the intersection (S220).<br>
As a result, predicted time to reach the intersection can be estimated<br>
based on the distance-to-go to the intersection from the position of the car<br>
and the current speed of the car (S230).<br>
The present invention of a method for displaying enlargement images of<br>
an intersection in a navigation device is characterized by displaying the<br>
enlargement images of an intersection earlier than a set time before the<br>
predicted time to reach the intersection as the car getting closer to the<br>
intersection in the path (S240).<br>
When the enlargement images of the intersection are displayed earlier<br>
than a set time before the predicted time to reach the intersection, the<br>
enlargement ratio of each image is controlled step by step according to the<br>
time-to-go to the intersection. For example, if the time for the enlargement<br>
images of the intersection to be displayed is one minute before the predicted<br>
time to reach the intersection, the enlargement images begin to be<br>
sequentially displayed on the screen of the navigation device one minute<br>
before the predicted time, and each image is displayed with different<br>
enlargement ratio as the car approaches the intersection.<br>
Conventional methods for displaying an enlargement image on the basis<br>
of distance-to-go to an intersection have a drawback of low accuracy in<br>
direction guidance by displaying an intersection enlarganent image, which is<br>
caused by error of GPS signals and inexactness in calculating the distance-<br>
to-go in constant change according to the current speed of a car.<br>
In a method for displaying enlargement images of an intersection<br>
according to the present invention, the enlargement images of an intersection<br>
are displayed on the basis of time left for the car to reach the<br>
intersection; and the enlargement ratio for each image is controlled in<br>
accordance with each predicted time to reach the intersection, which is on<br>
changing as the car getting closer to the intersection.<br>
In addition, in the present invention of a method for displaying<br>
intersection enlargement images, time to display the intersection enlargement<br>
images can be differently set according to a type of the road on which a car<br>
is running, thereby iiig)roving the accuracy in direction guidance at an<br>
intersection. For instance, as for a car driving on a general local road, the<br>
time for intersection enlargement images to be displayed can be set as fifty<br>
seconds before the predicted time to reach the intersection; and as for a car<br>
driving on an expressway, the time for intersection enlargonent images to be<br>
displayed can be set as one minute before the predicted time to reach the<br>
intersection, thereby taking into account of difference in average driving<br>
speed according to a type of a road.<br>
Time for intersection enlargement images to be displayed according to a<br>
type of a road can be set autonatically by the navigation device's<br>
recognition of the road type based on the present position of the car, or can<br>
be set by the user thereof. To take another instance, even if the time for<br>
intersection enlargement images to be displayed in a car driving on an<br>
expressway is automatically set as one minute before the predicted time to<br>
reach the intersection, the set time to display intersection enlargement<br>
images can be adjusted by the user as one and a half minutes, thereby<br>
performing direction guidance at an intersection with enlargement images<br>
thereof earlier than the originally set time.<br>
Meanwhile, enlargement images of an intersection can be real photos or<br>
3D images. In the anbodiment of the present invention of a method for<br>
displaying enlargement images of an intersection, merged enlargement images<br>
are employed: the backgroimds thereof are from real photos, and the road, the<br>
directional sign, and the direction sign-arrow thereof are 3D graphic images.<br>
Therefore, the present invention can provide path guidance with higher sense<br>
of reality by use of real photos of a view around the road, and can heighten<br>
the visibility in the guidance by use of 3D image road and directional signs.<br>
Besides, the 3D images for roads, directional signs and direction sign-<br>
arrows can be more and more enlarged gradually as the car approaches the<br>
intersection, thereby serving as signals to have the driver informed that the<br>
car comes closer to the intersection. When the guidance is made by voice, the<br>
volume or the interval thereof can be controlled in order to give the user<br>
information of getting closer to the intersection easily as well,<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram showing a navigation device performing the<br>
method for displaying intersection enlargements according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
A navigation device which performs the method for displaying<br>
enlargement images of an intersection according to the present invention<br>
coiiQ&gt;rises a receiving unit 310 to receive location signals from a satellite;<br>
an inputting unit 320 to receive inputs by a user; a controlling unit 330 to<br>
control displaying enlargement images of an intersection by calculating time<br>
for a vehicle to reach an intersection in the path thereof based on the real<br>
time distance between the present position of the vehicle and the location of<br>
the intersection and the current speed of the vehicle; a storing unit 340 to<br>
store map data, location data, and intersection images; and a displaying unit<br>
350 to display enlargement images of intersection on the screen thereof.<br>
The controlling unit 330 controls displaying said enlargement images of<br>
said intersection at a set time before the predicted time for the vehicle to<br>
reach the intersection, wherein said set time can be adjusted by a setting of<br>
the user, and also controls enlargement ratio for each of said intersection<br>
enlargement images to be displayed in sequence as the vehicle approaches the<br>
intersection.<br>
The navigation device which implements the method for displaying<br>
enlargement images of intersection according to the present invention adopts<br>
a merged image for an intersection enlargement image, wherein the merged<br>
image has a real photo of a view around an intersection and one or more of 3D<br>
image of the road, the directional sign, the direction sign-arrow thereof,<br>
and displays the enlargement image of the intersection through the displaying<br>
unit 350.<br>
FIG. 4 is an onbodiment of a method for displaying intersection<br>
enlargements in a navigation device according to the present invention.<br>
The intersection enlargement images 410 to 450 of FIG. 4 are shown in<br>
sequence in a navigation device according to the present invention of a<br>
method for displaying intersection enlargements. After the navigation device<br>
calculates predicted time for the vehicle to reach an intersection in the<br>
path on the basis of the distance from the vehicle to the intersection and<br>
the speed of the vehicle, and the navigation device displays an intersection<br>
enlargement image 410 at a set time before the predicted time to reach the<br>
intersection.<br>
When the navigation device displays the intersection enlargement images<br>
sequentially, the images 420 to 450 are enlarged with increased enlargement<br>
ratio for each image as the car gets closer to the intersection. This<br>
characteristic ingjroves visibility in direction guidance at an intersection<br>
and gives the user more sense of reality due to a merged image with a real<br>
photo and at least one of 3D images.<br>
FIG. 5 is another embodiment of a method for showing intersection<br>
enlargements in a navigation device according to the present invention.<br>
In the onbodiment of FIG. 5, the enlargement images of an intersection<br>
employ merged images 510 to 540 with a real photo for the background thereof<br>
and 3D graphic images for the road, the directional sign, the direction sign-<br>
arrow thereof, which performs guidance at a fork of a road which is in the<br>
course of a vehicle.<br>
Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been<br>
described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate<br>
