PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
2009<br>
15 OCT 2009<br><br>
The present invention concerns an in vitro method for medical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease comprising the steps of:<br>
-	providing a sample of a patient having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease,<br>
-	determining amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof having from 12 to 98 amino acids in said sample using at least one antibody that binds specifically to a partial sequence of amino-terrninal proANP,<br>
-	attributing the determined amino-terminal proANP level or the level of partial peptides thereof to a clinical picture wherein the attribution is carried out independent of the BMI of the patient.<br>
The present invention further concerns a rapid test assay for conducting the method of the present invention and the use of antibodies suitable for the method and assays according to the present invention.<br>
Heart failure (HF) is common, associated with high morbidity and mortality, and difficult to diagnose, particularly in the emergency department (ED) [Cleland, J.G. et al., Eur Heart J, 2003. 24(5): p. 442-63; Mosterd, A. et al., Heart, 2007. 93(9): p. 1137-46]. Dyspnea is the leading symptom of most HF patients. Unfortunately, neither patient history nor physical examination can accurately differentiate dyspnea due to HF from dyspnea due to other causes, such as pulmonary diseases [Mueller, C. et al., Can J Cardiol, 2005. 21(11): p. 921-4; Wang, C.S. et al., Jama, 2005. 294(15): p. 1944-56]. However, accurate diagnosis is mandatory for the selection of the most appropriate treatment.<br>
B-type natriuretic peptides are quantitative markers of HF that have been shown to be very helpful in the diagnosis of HF. The use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino-terminal fragment, N-terrninal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy in the ED [Januzzi, J.L., Jr., et al., Am J Cardiol, 2005.<br><br><br>
95(8): p. 948-54; Maisel, A.S. et al., N Engl J Med, 2002. 347(3): p. 161-7], and thereby improves patient evaluation and treatment [Moe, G.W. et al., Circulation, 2007. 115(24): p. 3103-10; Mueller, C. et al., N Engl J Med, 2004. 350(7): p. 647-54].<br>
The concentration of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in die circulation is approximately 50- to 100- fold higher than BNP [Pandey, K.N., Peptides, 2005. 26(6): p. 901-32.]. Therefore, the biological signal reflected by the increased ANP may be pathophysiologically and therefore diagnostically even more important than the signal of BNP. Despite this, little is known about the diagnostic performance of ANP and its precursors [Cowie, M.R. et al., Lancet, 1997. 350(9088): p. 1349-53]. Mature ANP is derived from the precursor N-terminal-proANP (NT-proANP), which is significantly more stable in the circulation than the mature peptide and is therefore thought to be a more reliable analyte [Vesely, D.L., rUBMB Life, 2002. 53(3): p. 153-9]. Nevertheless, due to the fact that NT-proANP might be subject to further fragmentation [Cappellin, E. et al., Clin Chim Acta, 2001. 310(1): p. 49-52], immunoassays for measurement of mid-regional proANP (MR-proANP) may have an advantage [Morgenthaler, N.G. et al., Clin Chem, 2004. 50(1): p. 234-6].<br>
Cardiac diseases, such as chronic heart failure (CHF), acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction are widely spread and often have a devastating prognosis. Early prognosis of the cardiac disease can improve patient outcome through timely preventive and therapeutic measures [Jortani, S.A. et al., Clin Chem 2004;50:265-278]. A wealth of data suggest that the assessment of natriuretic peptides represents a useful addition to chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and doppler echocardigraphy in verifying the clinical diagnosis and prognosis for suspected cardiac diseases [Cowie, M.R. et al., Eur Heart J 2003;24:1710-1718]. The most important members of the family of natriuretic peptides are atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Both are markers of cardiac function. In addition to the use in helping to establish the diagnosis of CHF [Cowie, M.R. et al., Lancet, 1997. 350(9088): p. 1349-53; Mueller, C. et al., N Engl J Med, 2004. 350(7): p. 647-54], they are used in the risk stratification of patients with stable or recently decompensated CHF [Omland, T. et al., Cirulation 1996;93:1963-1969; , Anand, I.S. et al., Circulation 2003;107:1278-1283; Cheng,V. et al, J Am Coll Cardiol 2001, 37:386-391], or with acute coronary syndrome [Morrow, D.A. et al., JAMA 2005, Dec. 14; 294(22):2866-71] and, in addition, are used in follow-up and guidance in CHF therapy [Troughton, R.W. et al., Lancet 2000, 355:1126-1130].<br><br>
Both BNP and the other cleavage product of its precursor, N-termianal proBNP (NT-proBNP) are currently used in the assessment of patients with CHF. ANP originates from the cleavage of its precursor pro ANP. The other cleavage product, N-terminal pro ANP (NT-pro ANP) is significantly more stable in circulation than ANP. Therefore, NT-proANP has been suggested to be a more reliable analyte in the prior art [Ala-Kopsala, M. et al., Clin Chem, 2004. 50(9): p. 1576-88]. However, the N- and C-terminal regions of the N-terminal pro-peptide can be altered through enzymatic degradation [Seidler, T. et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 1999,255:495-501]. Commonly, BNP and NT-proBNP are considered as being more suitable for the diagnosis and prognosis in patients with cardiac insufficiency than ANP and NT-proANP. The reason for this may be that the determination of ANP and NT-proANP is considered less reproducible, and that conceptional flaws in most of the applied assay designs lead to a partial underestimation of the amount of circulating analyte [Yoshibayashi, M. et al., Eur J. Endocrinol 1996;135:265-268; Vesely, D.L. et al., IUBMB Life, 2002. 53(3): p. 153-<br>
Usually, a peptide comprising 28 amino acids (99-126) of the C-teTminal section of a pro¬hormone comprising 128 amino acids (proANP; SEQ ID NO: 2) is referred to as the actual hormone ANP. Upon release of ANP from its pro-hormone proANP, an equimolar amount of the remaining larger partial, peptide of proANP, the N-terminal proANP, consisting of 98 amino acids (NT-proANP; proANP (1-98)) is released into circulation. As NT-proANP possesses a significantly greater half life time and stability NT-proANP can be used as laboratory parameter for diagnosis, follow-up and therapy control in cardiac diseases. For a deeper insight into the topic please refer to: Lothar Thomas (Editor), Labor und Diagnose, 5th expanded ed., sub-chapter 2.14 of chapter 2, Kardiale Diagnosrik, pages 116-118, arid the literature cited therein.<br>
Both for the determination of ANP itself as well as for the determination of NT-proANP in biological liquids (serum, plasma, urine), various immunoassays have been developed in the past and have been applied in clinical research and practice. The major part of such immunoassays for the determination of ANP and NT-proANP is based on the known priniciple of competitive immunoassays, the best known of which is the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Competitive immunoassays for the determination of proANP and ANP are described or used, for instance in [Cappellin, E. et al., Clin Chim Acta, 2001. 310(1): p. 49-52] and [Hiroshi Itoh et al., Journal of Hypertension 1988, 6 (suppl 4) S309-S319; Meleagros, L. et<br><br>
al.,; Peptides, Vol. 10, 545-550,1989; Amir Lerman et al., Lancet 1993, 341:1105-09, 1993; John G F Cleland et al., Heart 1996, 75:410-413; Martin G. Buckley et al., Clinical Science (1999)97:689-695].<br>
By the use of various antibodies which recognize various sequences of NT-proANP (NT-proANP 1-98; SEQ ID NO: 1) for the determination of NT-proANP with competitive immunoassays, it was interpreted that various peptides appear in biological liquids, in particular blood or urine, which correspond to degradation products of NT-proANP (proANP 1-98). In particular, it has been interpreted that low molecular fragments are formed form NT-proANP, in particular such fragments, to which the amino acid sequences 1-30, 31-67 and 79-98 of proANP have been addressed due to their immuno activity (cf. e.g. M. G. Buckley et al., Clinica Chimica Acta, 191 (1990) 1-14;, J.B. Hansen et al., Lab. Invest. 1995, 55:447-452; Rose M. Overton et al., Human Plasma and Serum; Peptides, Vol. 17, 1155-1162, 1996; Sreedevi Daggubati et al., Cardiovascular Research 36 (1997) 246-255; E. F. Macaulay Hunter et al., Scand J Clin Invest 1998; 58: 205-216;, Martina Franz et al., Kidney International, Vol. 58 (2000), 374-383, Fumiaki Marumo et al., Human Plasma and Urine; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 137:231-236 (1985) and Engelbert Hartter et al., Clin Chem Lab Med 2000, 38(19): 27-32).<br>
Competitive immunoassays which specifically recognize the above-mentioned sequences always recognize the full NT-proANP in the same manner - disregarding influences based on different avidities or possible conformative influences - and do therefore not differentiate between NT-proANP and its fragments.<br>
In contrast to competitive immunoassays, non-competitive sandwich immunoassays show a number of advantages. For instance, they can be interpreted as solid phase assays (heterogeneous assays) more readily, are more robust, provide measurement results with a greater sensitivity, exhibit less cross-reactivity, and are more suitable for automation and serial measurements. Furthermore, by recognizing only such molecules and/or peptides in which both binding moieties for the antibodies which are used for the sandwich formation are present in the same molecule, sandwich immunoassays may lead to slightly different conclusions in comparison with competitive immunoassays which only apply one type of antibody. If, for instance, the binding areas are located on different partial peptides<br><br>
(degradation product, fragments) a binding of the antibodies to such fragments will not lead to the measurement signal which is typical for the complete "sandwich".<br>
Due to the known advantages of sandwich immunoassays in principle as well as due to the possibility of selectively measuring only complete NT-proANP without any influence of degradation products and fragements, sandwich immunoassays for the determination of NT-proANP have already been described and applied in clinical research and practice. For instance, EP 721 105 Bl describes a sandwich immunoassay for the determination of proANP, in particular in the area of diagnosis of cardiac diseases and chronic kidney failure, using two monoclonal antibodies, one of which binds to amino acids 1-25 of proANP (compare EP 350 218 Bl) and the other of which binds to amino acids 43-66 of proANP. By this kind of sandwich immunoassay, only such proANP partial peptides are detected or co-detected in the presence of proANP (1-98), which comprise at least the first 66 amino acids of the proANP sequence.<br>
Another sandwich immunoassay which is similar in this respect is described in [Mats Stridsberg et al., J.Med.Sci 102, 99-108, Vol. 18: 1201-1203]. This sandwich immunoassay also uses two monoclonal antibodies, one of which binds to amino acids 1-30 of proANP, while the other binds to amino acids 79-98. Due to the choice of binding areas at the terminal ends of proANP (1-98) it can be assumed that this sandwich immunoassay will only detect intact proANP (1-98).<br>
WO 00/19207 describes a method for the determination of proANP (1-98) in which two of three polyclonal antibodies are used, which bind to the aminod acid sequences 8-27, 31-64 or 79-98 of the proANP (1-98) sequence. The assay for the determination of proANP (1-98) commercially offered by the applicant of WO 00/19207 is an enzyme immunoassay, using a pair of affinity purified polyclonal sheep antibodies, of which the immobilized antibody recognizes amino acids 10-19 of proANP, while a second polyclonal antibody is used for detection, which recognizes amino acids (85-90) (compare operation manual of the sandwich assay proANP (1-98) by BIOMEDICA, A-1210 Wien). Thus, this assay also recognizes only peptide species containing the terminal ends of the full proANP (1-98), i.e. complete or nearly complete NT-proANP).<br>

All competitive assays or assays which apply the sandwich principle described in the prior art have basically been developed as assays for cardial diagnostics or which have been used in the context of cardial diagnostics, whereby chronic kidney failure has been mentioned as further diagnostic application (compare EP 721 105 Bl and citation [Buckley MG et al., AM. J. Hypertens. 1990 Dec, 3 (12 Ptl): 933-935]).<br>
Furthermore, a new sandwich immunoassay for the determination of the central region of proANP (amino acids 53-73) has been developed, the measurement results of which are not influenced by a putative terminal truncation of the peptide [Clinical Chemistry 50, No.l, 2004, pages 234-236].<br>
It was an object of the invention to provide an in vitro method for medical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease which provides reliable information especially to the medical practitioner in the Emergency Department (ED).<br>
Thus, the present invention comprises an in vitro method for medical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease comprising the steps of:<br>
-	providing a sample of a patient having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease,<br>
-	determining amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof having from 12 to 98 amino acids in said sample using at least one antibody that binds specifically to a partial sequence of amtno-terttuBal proANP,<br>
-	attributing the determined arnino-terminal proANP level or the level of partial peptides thereof to a clinical picture wherein the attribution is carried out independent of the BMI of the patient.<br>
Preferably, the in vitro method according to the present invention is carried out, wherein the attribution to a clinical picture is carried out with help of a BMI independent cut-off value.<br>
Attribution to a clinical picture means that the determined ammo-terminal proANP level or the level of partial peptides thereof is used for the medical diagnosis, prognosis or therapy<br><br>
follow-up for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease wherein the use is carried out independent of the BMI of the patient.<br>
The cardiac disease of the patient may be selected from but not restricted to chronic heart failure, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the disease is diagnosed, thus said method is a method for medical diagnosis.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the cardiac disease is heart failure. The in vitro method according to the invention is especially well-suited and reliable for patients that exhibit symptoms of dyspnoea and are therefore suspected of having heart failure and the clinical picture is diagnosed. The evaluation and management of patients presenting to the Emergency Department is facilitated by the method according to the present invention. Accurate diagnosis is mandatory for the selection of the most appropriate treatment for such patients. Therefore, the present invention meets the need to accurately differentiate dyspnea due to heart failure from dyspnea due to other causes, such as pulmonary diseases. The method according to the present invention, therefore, significantly improves diagnostic accuracy for heart failure.<br>
It has been described that the concentration of NT-proANP as well as of BNP is reduced with increasing BMI in the healthy population [Wang, T.J. et al., Circulation, 2004.109(5): p. 594-600]. The authors therefore deduce that natriuretic peptides rather are not suitable as markers in obese patients ("Second, plasma natriuretic peptide levels may be a less useful marker for heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction in obese individuals, a Speculation that merits investigation.").<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found in the context of this invention that for a certain sub-population of patients with a cardiac disease (chronic heart failure), namely such with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of equal or greater than 30 kg/cm2, in particular the determination of amino terminal proANP or partial peptides derived thereof in a biological sample originating from these patients allows for a reliable prognosis. This is exactly the sub-population, of which Wang, et al. deduced that natriuretic peptides may be less useful markers. It has been described in a recent publication that BNP also has a prognostic value in the sub-group of obese patients in hospitalized patients which chronic heart failure [Horwich, T.B. et al., J.<br><br>
Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2006, Jan. 3, 47(l):85-90; Epub 2005, Dec. 15]. In the context of this invention, it has been found surprisingly that NT-proANP has been more reliable in respect to the prognosis of said sub-population of patients in comparison with the BNP analogue NT-proBNP.<br>
In the following a preferred embodiment of the present invention is described relating to a in vitro method, wherein the patient or the patient group has a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2 and the sample is provided by a patient having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2.<br>
A subject of the present invention is an in vitro method according to the present invention, wherein the patient or the patient group has a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m and the sample is provided by a patient having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m .<br>
Thus, a subject of the present invention is an in vitro method for medical diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease and having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2, comprising the following steps:<br>
-	providing a sample of a patient having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease and a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2, and<br>
-	determining amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof in said sample using at least one antibody that binds specifically to partial sequences of amino-terminal pro ANP.<br>
The method according to the present invention is particularly suitable for the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up in patients having chronic heart failure.<br>
The method according to the present invention is particularly suitable for the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up in patients having chronic heart failure and having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2. The method according to the present invention is especially well suited for the prognosis for patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease and having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2, especially in case wherein the disease is chronic heart failure.<br><br>
In this patient group, i.e. patients having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease and having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2, especially in case wherein the disease is chronic heart failure, the method according to the invention is preferably carried out on patients which are not (supposedly) asymptomatic.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the optimum threshold for the mortality prognosis in the patient group with a BMI equal or greater than 30 kg/m2 is in the range between 190 and 210, preferably between 195 and 205, most preferred at 199 pmol/1. The optimum threshold for the group BMI 
Surprisingly, it has been found that in the method according to the present invention the optimum threshold for patients with a BMI &gt; 30 is lower than for patients with a BMI  30 is lower than for patients with a BMI 
The intra-assay variation coefficient of the assay, defined as variation coefficient, which results for a given measurement value from a 10-fold determination in one reaction batch, is preferably at most 10% for all measurement values. It is disadvantageous to exceed this value, as this may lead to erroneous attributions of measurement values in respect to thresholds and may therefore lead to false conclusions.<br>
Therefore, the in vitro methods according to the present invention may be performed with patients having a BMI below 30 kg/m2 and with patients having a BMI above or equal to 30 kg/m2. Threshold values of from 190 to 260 pmol/1, preferably of from 195 to 240 pmol/1, are suitable for the methods of the present invention independent of the BMI of the patient However, in preferred embodiments of the invention, the threshold values for patients with BMI equal or greater than 30 kg/m2 is chosen such that it is in the range between 190 and 210, preferably between 195 and 205, most preferred at 199 pmol/1. The optimum threshold for the group BMI 
<br><br>
In particular, the sample provided by a patient may be plasma, serum, blood or urine.<br>
According to the invention, the antibodies may be monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies. Thus, at least one antibody is a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody.<br>
Preferred are polyclonal antibodies, in particular affinity purified polyclonal antibodies.<br>
The method according to the present invention is particularly preferred wherein the mid-regional area of amino-terminal proANP, spanning amino acid 50 to amino acid 90, is used for the determination of amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof in a sample.<br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof in a sample are determined with a sandwich immunoassay applying two antibodies. In particular, this is preferred if amino-terminal proANP or partial peptides thereof are determined by the use of two antibodies, which specifically bind to different partial sequences of N-terminal proANP.<br>
It is particularly preferred that one of the antibodies is obtained by immunizing an animal with an antigen containing a synthetic peptide sequence comprising amino acids 53-72 of proANP, and the other antibody is obtained by immunizing an animal with an antigen containing a synthetic peptide sequence comprising amino acids 73-90 of proANP. In another embodiment the synthetic peptide sequence comprising amino acids 53-72 of proANP has an additional N-terminal cysteine group. In another preferred embodiment the other antibody is obtained by immunizing an animal with an antigen containing a synthetic peptide sequence comprising amino acids 72-90 or 73-83 of proANP together with an additional N-terminal cystein group. The antibodies obtained by the use of said synthetic peptides, together representing a complete mid-regional part of the proANP sequence, therefore only recognize binding areas in the range of amino acids 53-83 of NT-proANP, and can detect said range completely in form of polyclonal antibodies.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the in vitro method according the invention, one of the antibodies is labelled and the second is bound to or may be bound selectively to a solid phase.<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the assay, one of the antibodies is labeled while the other is either bound to a solid phase or can be bound selectively to a solid phase. In a preferred embodiment the method is executed as heterogeneous sandwich immunoassay, wherein one of the antibodies is immobilized on an arbitrarily chosen solid phase, for example, the walls of coated test tubes (e.g. polystyrol test tubes; coated tubes; CT) or microtiter plates, for example composed of polystyrol, or to particles, such as for instance magnetic particles, whereby the other antibody has a group resembling a detectable label or enabling for selective attachment to a label, and which serves the detection of the formed sandwich structures. A temporarily delayed or subsequent immobilization using suitable solid phases is also possible.<br>
The method according to the present invention can furthermore be embodied as a homogeneous method, wherein the sandwich complexes formed by the antibody/antibodies and the proANP or proANP partial peptide which is to be detected Temains suspended in the liquid phase. In this case it is preferred, that when two antibodies are used, both antibodies are labeled with parts of a detection system, which leads to generation of a signal or triggering of a signal if both antibodies are integrated into a single sandwich. Such techniques are to be embodied in particular as fluorescence enhancing or fluorescence quenching detection methods. A particularly preferred embodiment relates to the use of detection reagents which are to be used pair-wise, such as for example tie ones which are described in US-A-4 882 733, EP-B1 0 180 492 or EP-B1 0 539 477 and the prior art cited therein. In this way, measurements in which only reaction products comprising both labeling components in a single immuno complex directly in the reaction mixture are detected, become possible. For example, such tectoologies are offered under the brand names" TRACE® (Time Resolved Amplified Cryptate Emission) or KRYPTOR®, implementing the teachings of the above-cited applications.<br>
In principle, all labeling techniques which can be applied in assays of said type can be used, such as labeling with radioisotopes, enzymes, fluorescence-, chemoluminescence- or bioluminescence labels and directly optically detectable colour labels, such as gold atoms and dye particles, which are used in particular in Point-of-Care (POC) or rapid tests. In the case of heterogeneous sandwich immunoassays, both antibodies may exhibit parts of the detection system according to the type described herein in the context of homogenous assays.<br><br>
In a preferred alternative both the first and the second antibody are dispersed in the liquid reaction medium, whereby a first labeling component which is part of a labeling system based on fluorescence- or chemoluminescence quenching or enhancement is bound to the first antibody, and whereby the second labeling component of this labeling system is bound to the second antibody, such that after binding of both antibodies to the arnino-terminal proANP which is to be detected, a detectable signal is generated which enables for a detection of the sandwich complexes formed in the measuring solution. One embodiment of this alternative comprises the labeling system rare earth kryptates or chelates in combination with a fluorescence- or cheminoluminescence-dye. In particular preferred embodiment the labelling system comprises a rare earth kryptate in combination with a fluorescence or chemiluminescence dye.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the detection is carried out with a competitive immunoassay. In a particularly preferred embodiment a radioimmunoassay is used.<br>
The method according to the present invention can be conducted in combination with other markers and/or methods. This means that the measurement methods according to the present invention can be conducted particularly advantageously as multi-parameter diagnostic. Hereby, at least one further marker, preferably chosen from the group of inflammatory markers, cardiovascular markers, or ischemic markers is determined additionally.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method the inflammatory marker is selected from the group comprising C-reactive protein (CRP), cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, interleukines, such as EL-6, procalcitonine (1-116 or partial peptides thereof) arid adhesion molecules, such as VCAM or ICAM.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method the cardiovasculary marker is selected from the group comprising at least one marker of the group myeloperoxidase, complete peptides or partial peptides of: proBNP, pro-Endothelin-1, proAdrenomedullin, proVasopressine, pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (proGRP), pro-Leptin, pro-Neuropeptide-Y, pro-Somatostatin, pro-Neuropeptide-YY, pro-Opionmelanocortin.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method the ischemic marker is selected from the group comprising at least one marker of the group Troponin I or T, CK-MB, myoglobin.<br><br>
Hereby the markers can be determined in parallel or simultaneously in the method according to the present invention. In the aforementioned multi-parameter determinations it can be envisaged that the measurement results for a number of parameters are evaluated simultaneously or in parallel and for example with the aid of a computer program using diagnostically significant correlations of parameters.<br>
In the method according to the present invention an echocardiography or an electrocardiogram can be recorded as an additional method.<br>
As outlined above the cardiac disease of the patient may be but is not limited to chronic heart failure, acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction.<br>
As discussed above, it is therefore within the scope of the present invention to develop the methods according to the present invention as a rapid test-assay.<br>
Hereby, the sample provided by a patient having a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a cardiac disease and optionally having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m2 is:<br>
-	applied to the sample application zone of a rapid test system,<br>
-	contacted with at least one antibody which specifically binds to partial sequences of ammo-terminal proANP in the reaction zone, and whereby<br>
-	ammo-terminal  proANP  or partial  peptides  derived thereof to  which the antibody/anrlbodtes are bound are detected in the detection zone.<br>
Preferably, the rapid test system may be a microfluidic test system.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the rapid test system may be a lateral flow test device. This rapid test system may be a solid phase lateral flow test device.<br>
The method according to the present invention can be executed in a rapid test system based on immuno migration and/or chromatography.<br><br>
Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention is a rapid test system for the implementation of the method according to the present invention in all embodiments described herein for the determination of amino proANP or partial peptides thereof in the sample of a patient with a cardiac disease or being suspected of developing or having a<br>
2<br>
cardiac disease and optionally having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m , wherein at least one antibody, which specifically binds to partial sequences of amino-terminal proANP is used. Preferably, the partial sequences are at least 12 amino acids in length. More preferably the partial sequences are from 50 to 98 amino acids in length.<br>
Thus, further subject-matter of the invention is also the use of at least one antibody specifically binding to partial sequences of amino-terminal proANP for medicinal diagnosis, prognosis and therapy follow-up for patients being suspected of having or developing a<br>
2<br>
cardiac disease and optionally having a BMI of equal or greater than 30 kg/m .<br>
In the following the invention is explained in more detail by the description of the obtained results of the determination of NT-proANP andNP-proBNP in biological samples of patients.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
An assay as described in [Morgenthaler, N.G. et al., Clin Chem, 2004. 50(1): p. 234-6]] was used for the measurement of amino-terminal proANP. NT-proBNP was determined using the commercially available test by Roche according to the manual (Elecsys).<br>
Both markers were determined in plasma samples of patients with chronic heart failure. In particular the sub-group of patients (n=144) with a Body Mass Index &gt;= 30 kg/m2 was further investigated. Of these 144 patients, 26 patients died in the course of 24 months due to cardiovasculary events. For evaluation of the prognostic efficiency of both markers, data were analyzed by Cox-regression (StatView 5.0 software for windows; Abacus Concepts, Berkley, CA). The median of the values for NT-proBNP (in pg/ml) was 5 times greater than for amino-terminal proANP (in pmol/1). Therefore, the riskratio for NT-proBNP in comparison to MR-proANP was calculated for a 5 times bigger increase in concentration in the Cox-analysis.<br><br>
Results of the univariant Cox Proportional Hazard Analysis:<br>
MarkerChiSquare	RiskRatio (95% CI)	p<br>
NT-pro ANP(100pmol/l increase)     14.4141.503(1.217-1.855)    
Independent of the fact that no significant result was obtained for NT-proBNP (p=0.416), the RiskRatio of 1.503 for NT-proANP in comparison to NT-proBNP (1.024) clearly shows the advantage in the sub-group of patients with a BMI &gt;=30. A RiskRatio of 1.000 indicates that the risk of death per concentration unit does not increase. For NT-proANP a RiskRatio of 1.503 therefore means that the risk of death per concentration unit (here 100 pmol/1) increases by 50.3%. In comparison to NT-proBNP this is a 21-fold greater increase of the risk.<br>
Result of the rnulitvariant Cox Proportional Hazard Analysis:<br>
MarkerChiSquare      RiskRatio (95% CI)	p<br>
LN NT-proANP        7.198  2.776(1.317-5.854)    0.007 LN NT-proBNP        0.005   0.985(0.644-1.506)    0.943<br>
Again, the result demonstrates the advantage of NT-proANP as it persists as independent predictor for death in the sub-group of patients with the BMI &gt;=30 in a model with NT-proBNP (p=0.007). In contrast thereto, NT-proBNP is not an independent predictor.<br>
Also in the ROC analysis NT-pfoANP was superior to NT-proBNP (AUC=0.61) for the mortality prognosis of the sub-group of patients with the BMI &gt;=30 with an AUC of 0.66. The optimum threshold of NT-proANP for the prognosis ways 199 pmol/1.<br>
Example 2<br>
Study Population<br>
We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients presenting to the ED. To be eligible for the study, a patient had to have dyspnea as the most prominent symptom. Patients under 18 years of age, patients on hemodialysis and trauma patients were excluded. The study was carried<br>
16<br><br>
out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participating patients.<br>
Clinical Evaluation of Patients<br>
Patients underwent an initial clinical assessment that included clinical history, physical examination, ECG, pulse oximetry, blood tests including arterial blood gas analysis (when indicated) and chest x-ray. Echocardiography and pulmonary function tests were strongly recommended in the ED on an outpatient basis or in the hospital if the patient was admitted. For each patient enrolled in the study, ED physicians assessed the probability that the patient had HF (by assigning a value of 0 to 100 percent clinical certainty) as the cause of his or her dyspnea including all available information of the physical examination, ECG, chest x-ray and blood tests including BNP.<br>
Reference ("Gold") Standard Definition of Heart Failure<br>
To determine the actual diagnosis, two independent cardiologists reviewed all medical records pertaining to the patient and independently classified the diagnosis as dyspnea due to HF or dyspnea due to another cause than HF. Both cardiologists had access to the ED charts and any additional information that became available during or after the evaluation in the ED. This information included the BNP levels, chest x-ray, medical history that was not available to the ED physicians, results of subsequent tests such as echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, or left ventriculography, performed at the time of cardiac catheterization, pulmonary function test, CT scan, compression ultrasound for the assessment of pulmonary embolism, right heart catheterization, the hospital course for patients admitted to the hospital, the response to therapy, autopsy data in deceased patients and information about clinical events Of readmissions during 90-day follow up. The BNP level was considered as a quantitative marker of HF and therefore interpreted as a continuous variable to make best use of the information provided by this test. The higher the BNP level, the higher the probability of HF being present and to be the cause of dyspnea. Absolute BNP values were adjusted for the presence of kidney disease and obesity to maximize diagnostic accuracy (Mueller, C. et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 2007.137(1-2): p. 4-12.).<br>
Measurement of Natriuretic Peptides<br>
During initial evaluation, a blood sample was collected into tubes containing potassium<br>
EDTA. The MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were analyzed from plasma samples immediately<br><br>
frozen at -80°C until analysis. Detection of MR-proANP was performed using a sandwich immunoassay (MR-proANP LIA, B.R.A.H.M.S, Hennigsdorf/Berlin, Germany) as described in detail elsewhere (Morgenthaler, N.G., et al., Clin Chem, 2004. 50(1): p. 234-6.). Median MR-proANP in 325 healthy individuals in previous investigations was 45 pmol/1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 43 to 49 pmol/1) (Morgenthaler, N.G., et al., Clin Chem, 2004. 50(1): p. 234-6.). The NT-proBNP levels were determined by a quantitative electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys proBNP, Roche Diagnostics AG, Zug, Switzerland). BNP was measured by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (AxSym, Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA).<br>
Statistical Analysis<br>
Univariate data on demographic and clinical features were compared between patients with dyspnea due to HF and patients with dyspnea not due to HF by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were considered as continuous variables and were log-transformed to achieve normality. The primary objective was to compare the accuracy of MR-proANP with that of NT-proBNP. As BNP levels were available for the reference ("Gold") standard diagnosis of HF, the comparison of the MR-proANP with BNP was considered biased in favor of BNP and therefore BNP was not included in the ROC analysis. The secondary objective was to investigate, whether the addition of MR-proANP to clinical judgment in the ED, including chest x-ray and BNP information, would further increase diagnostic accuracy. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP for HF, receivers operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and areas under the curve (AUCs) were calculated fof both markefs. AUCs were compared according to the method by Hanley and McNeil (Hanley, J.A. et al., Radiology, 1983. 148(3): p. 839-43.). The optimal cut-off-point was arrived by selecting the point on the ROC curve that maximized both sensitivity and specificity. The optimum cut point for ED clinical certainty of HF was chosen at &gt;80%, a cut point providing reasonable and actionable certainty McCullough, P.A., et al., Circulation, 2002. 106(4): p. 416-22. The diagnostic accuracies of both assays at optimal cut-off concentrations as determined by ROC analysis were compared by the McNemar test (comparison of discordant pairs of false biochemical classifications). To determine odds ratios for the detection of HF with respect to MR-proANP and NT-proBNP thresholds of highest diagnostic accuracy, logistic regression analysis was performed unadjusted and adjusted for significant covariates (age, prior CHF, prior myocardial infarction, estimated glomerular<br><br>
filtration rate, hemoglobin, pulmonary rales, peripheral edema and jugular venous distension). Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation was used to assess the relation of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP concentrations in the study population. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using the conventional formula of weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Normal weight was defined as a BMI 
Results<br>
A total of 287 patients were enrolled in this study (Figure 3). The median age was 77 years. There were 149 men (52%) and 138 women (48%). Arterial hypertension was present in 68% of the patients, 28% had coronary heart disease, and 34% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Diuretics (52%) were the most common prescribed chronic medications, followed by ACE-inhibitors or AT-II-receptor-blockers (49%) and beta-blockers (39%). On examination, 54 % of patients had rales in the lower lung fields, 42 % had lower extremity edema and 28 % had jugular venous distension.<br>
The adjudicated gold standard diagnosis was HF in 154 (54%) patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 71 (25%) patients, pneumonia in 33 (11%) patients, malignancy in 10 (3%) patients, pulmonary embolism in 8 (3%) patients, hyperventilation in 7 (2%) patients and other causes such as interstitial lung disease, asthma or bronchitis in 14 (5%) patients. There were several patients with two main reasons for dyspnea such as exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia.<br>
The levels of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP in patients with and without an adjudicated gold standard diagnosis of HF are shown in Figure 4. The median MR-proANP concentration of those patients with HF (400 pmol/L, IQR 246 - 642 pmol/1) was significantly higher than of those without HF (92 pmol/L, IQR 92 - 173 pmol/1; p 
19<br><br><br>
The AUC of MR-proANP was 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95) for the diagnosis of HF, identical to the AUC of NT-proBNP with 0.92 (95% CI 0.89 to 0.95; p - 0.791; Figure 6 a). On the basis of the ROC analysis, the optimal diagnostic cut-off-value for MR-proANP and NT-proBNP to reach the highest diagnostic accuracy was 206 pmol/1 and 1540 pg/ml, respectively. At this cut-off, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for MR-proANP were all 84%. Logistic regression analysis confirmed MR-proANP as a powerful predictor of HF in both, univariate and multivariate analyses (Figure 5).<br>
The AUC for the combination of ED-probability with MR-proANP was significantly higher than for ED-probability alone (p=0.016, Figure 6 b). The diagnostic accuracy for clinical judgment with high ED probability of HF (80% to 100% clinical certainty) was 79.4%. Therefore, as an overall measure of diagnostic value, MR-proANP levels &gt; 206 pmol/L added to ED-probability would have increased the diagnostic accuracy considerably to 87.8% (p  80% certainty were relatively independent indicators, as reflected by a Cohens Kappa value of 0.47 (pO.OOl).<br>
As shown in Figure 8, MR-proANP and NT-proBNP differed regarding their association with BMI. In patients with HF, mean MR-proANP levels were not different in overweight and obese patients compared with individuals with normal BMI (p = 0.346 for both), whereas NT-proBNP levels were lower in overweight and obese patients than in normal weight patients (p -0.025 for both).<br>
