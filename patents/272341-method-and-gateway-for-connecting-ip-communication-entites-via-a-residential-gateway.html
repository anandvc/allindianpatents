				<td>METHOD AND GATEWAY FOR CONNECTING IP COMMUNICATION<br>
ENTITES VIA A RESIDENTIAL GATEWAY<br>
The invention relates to a method and a system for<br>
linking SIP terminals, or terminals that are able to<br>
implement a call setup protocol, for example the SIP<br>
protocol (for Session Initiation Protocol), to<br>
residential gateways.<br>
From the outset, it will be noted that the<br>
expression "residential gateway" is understood to refer<br>
to a client gateway, that is to say a gateway situated<br>
user side, in contradistinction to an item of network<br>
equipment situated in the network under the control of<br>
the operator. It may, by way of nonlimiting examples,<br>
be a gateway for domestic use within a residence or a<br>
gateway for professional use within a company. In a<br>
general way, it is a gateway for client use.<br>
Numerous offers of telephone facilities over the<br>
IP network are, at the present time, based on domestic<br>
installations composed of a residential gateway linking<br>
one or more mono or multimedia terminals, such as<br>
visiophone analog telephones, personal computers,<br>
digital televisions for example.<br>
The aforesaid residential gateways are also<br>
referred, to as intelligent residential gateways, since<br>
they make it possible, in fact, to link various<br>
categories of networks.<br>
The present invention is aimed more particularly<br>
at the functionalities of residential gateways intended<br>
for real time electronic communication services, such<br>
as VoIP telephony (voice over IP) , video-telephony for<br>
example.<br>
The aforesaid residential gateways communicate<br>
with the operator's network by virtue of a call control<br>
protocol whose objective is the creation of a VoIP type<br>
communication context between two IP terminations. The<br>
objective of the aforesaid SIP protocol defined by the<br>
IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) is to allow<br>
 <br>
setup, modification and termination of multimedia<br>
sessions in an IP network or within the framework of<br>
architectures for controlling networks based on IP<br>
transport.<br>
The role of residential gateways in exchanges of<br>
SIP signaling depends on the type of terminal linked<br>
up:<br>
when the terminal linked up is not an IP<br>
terminal such as an analog, RNIS, Bluetooth, DECT or<br>
other terminal, the gateway plays the role of SIP<br>
termination by performing the translation between the<br>
SIP signaling exchanged with the network and the<br>
signaling exchanged with the terminal. This situation<br>
corresponds to the case of the "VEG" VoIP Embedded<br>
Gateway function represented in Figure la, this type of<br>
terminal being referred to as a non-IP terminal in the<br>
present patent application;<br>
- when the terminal linked up is of IP type, any<br>
SIP terminal, the residential gateway behaves as a<br>
simple router and steers the SIP messages to the<br>
terminal or terminals concerned. The latter then play<br>
the role of termination for the SIP protocol.<br>
Current residential gateways may operate according<br>
to two operative modes making it possible to manage<br>
multiline connection, such as represented in Figure la.<br>
The SIP protocol comprises a registration phase,<br>
termed the REGISTER phase, the object of which is the<br>
creation, in the network, of an association between the<br>
public identity of a user, on the basis of which the<br>
latter can be contacted, telephone number or SIP<br>
Universal Resource Identifier URI, and the network<br>
address or addresses of the terminals enabling the<br>
network to contact them. The aforesaid association is<br>
stored in a location database.<br>
The first operative mode represented in Figure lb,<br>
consists in declaring each terminal, separately in<br>
relation to the network, situated or not situated<br>
behind the same residential gateway, even when these<br>
 <br>
terminals share one and the same public identity. The<br>
network then acts as if the declared terminals were not<br>
hosted by the same residential gateway.<br>
In this multiline operative mode during the<br>
registration phase, each declared terminal announces<br>
its network address, IP address + port pair, and its<br>
public identity, telephone number. The corresponding<br>
association is stored in a database so as to be<br>
interrogated by a specific item of equipment, such as<br>
an SIP proxy, handling the trunking of the incoming<br>
calls to their final destination(s).<br>
Each terminal has a priori a different network<br>
address from the others, independently of the fact that<br>
it does or does not share its public identity with<br>
another terminal.<br>
Within the framework of the aforesaid operative<br>
mode, one and the same public identity thus points to<br>
several network addresses. With each incoming call to a<br>
given public number, on receipt of a call setup<br>
message, the SIP proxy forwards this message to each of<br>
the SIP destinations through interrogation of the<br>
database. In this automatic call distribution system<br>
referred to as "forking", the residential gateway<br>
merely routes the incoming IP packets, as would a<br>
simple IP router.<br>
A second operative mode, represented in Figure lc,<br>
consists in incorporating into the residential gateway<br>
an application package processing allowing the gateway<br>
to offer the network a single physical interface by<br>
handling the final trunking of the incoming calls to<br>
the appropriate SIP destination or destinations, that<br>
is to say the terminals.<br>
During the registration phase, the residential<br>
gateway sends registration messages for the account of<br>
the terminals that it links.<br>
Several modes of implementation are conceivable,<br>
depending on whether the terminals send or do not send<br>
any registration messages.<br>
 <br>
Under the first assumption, the residential<br>
gateway intercepts the "REGISTER" registration messages<br>
sent by the SIP terminals and modifies them so as to<br>
appear as the single SIP destination for the whole set<br>
of numbers attached to the terminals that it connects.<br>
Furthermore, the residential gateway stores in an<br>
internal database the correspondence between the public<br>
identity allocated to the terminal and the associated<br>
network address.<br>
Under the second assumption, the residential<br>
gateway determines on the basis of configuration data<br>
the associations between network addresses of the<br>
terminals and corresponding allocated public<br>
identities, then sends one or more "REGISTER"<br>
registration messages on the basis of these<br>
associations, here again passing itself off as the<br>
single SIP destination to be contacted. On receipt by<br>
its internal SIP processing logic of an "INVITE" call<br>
setup message, the residential gateway determines the<br>
public identity targeted by the call, by inspecting the<br>
header of the SIP message "To", then interrogates its<br>
internal database, so as to retrieve the SIP terminal<br>
or terminals concerned so as to forward the "INVITE"<br>
call setup message to them.<br>
The first and second operative modes of the prior<br>
art exhibit the drawbacks hereinafter.<br>
The solution according to the first operative mode<br>
according to the "forking" technique requires the<br>
storage at each instant by the network of the linkup<br>
topology information for all the residential gateways.<br>
In addition to the aforesaid storage, this operative<br>
mode leads to the generation of more signaling than is<br>
necessary. Specifically, the operations of<br>
registering/de-registering the terminals lead<br>
systematically to exchanges of registration messages.<br>
Moreover, during an incoming call, a call setup request<br>
must be sent to each of the terminals. The network must<br>
 <br>
then take on board the cancellation of the transactions<br>
with no response by the targeted terminal.<br>
The solution according to the second operative<br>
mode, palliative processing incorporated into the<br>
gateway, exhibits the drawback of adding non-trivial<br>
appliccition procedures to the residential gateway, as<br>
well as an internal mini-database. This solution<br>
therefore appears to be prejudicial to the performance<br>
of the residential gateway.<br>
The subject of the present invention is to remedy<br>
the drawbacks of the aforesaid prior art solutions.<br>
A subject of the present invention is the<br>
implementation of a method and of a residential gateway<br>
that may suit all the linkup configurations and<br>
terminals behind a residential gateway, in particular,<br>
a public identity per terminal, a public identity<br>
shared by several terminals, several public identities<br>
attached to the same terminal.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is<br>
furthermore the implementation of a method and of a<br>
residential gateway not requiring any incorporation of<br>
application into the residential gateway, the latter<br>
not having to be aware of the correspondence between<br>
the tesrminals that it links up and their associated<br>
public identities, so as to reduce to a situation<br>
comparable to the mode of network handling via<br>
"forking".<br>
Another subject of the present invention is also<br>
the implementation of a method and of a residential<br>
gateway in which the management of the terminal<br>
association or terminal address and public identity is<br>
also no longer performed by the network, which, in<br>
particular, does not have to be aware of the number of<br>
terminals associated with a public identity and of<br>
their respective network address (addresses), the<br>
network having to be aware only of the correspondence<br>
between the public identity or identities and the<br>
network address of the residential gateway, so as to<br>
 <br>
reduce to a situation comparable with the operative<br>
mode with SIP application package processing<br>
incorporated into the gateway. This exhibits the<br>
advantage of not complicating the processing of the<br>
incoming calls destined for a number corresponding to<br>
several terminals situated behind one and the same<br>
residential gateway.<br>
Specifically, in such linkup configurations, a<br>
single call setup request is sent to the gateway,<br>
rather than one per terminal corresponding to the<br>
requested number.<br>
In particular, a subject of the present invention<br>
is the implementation of a residential gateway<br>
operating mechanism making it possible to process<br>
complex linkup configurations, in particular suited to<br>
the linking up of terminals sharing one and the same<br>
call number, a residential gateway in accordance with<br>
the subject of the invention being dubbed "multi-line"<br>
when, linking up several terminals, one and the same<br>
public identity is associated with them, a telephone<br>
number corresponding to a particular case of public<br>
identity.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is,<br>
finally, the implementation of a method and of a<br>
residential gateway operating with a call control<br>
signaling protocol based on an IP technology, in<br>
particular, the SIP protocol defined by RFC 3261, the<br>
H.323 protocol or ultimately any other call control<br>
protocol of the same type.<br>
Another subject of the present invention is also<br>
the implementation of a method and of a residential<br>
gateway that may be implemented not only for SIP<br>
terminals, but also for any termination point of SIP<br>
type internal to the residential gateway, in fact<br>
representing an interface to a non-IP terminal, the<br>
processings necessary for such a transition being<br>
performed by the corresponding VEG module internal to<br>
the residential gateway.<br>
 <br>
The method for linking to an IP network, by way of<br>
a residential gateway, a plurality of IP communication<br>
entities to which are allocated respective public<br>
identities and which are able to implement a call<br>
control protocol, said IP communication entities,<br>
internal or external to the gateway, being connected to<br>
the latter, which is the subject of the invention, is<br>
noteworthy in that it comprises a prior step of<br>
registering the respective public identities of said IP<br>
communication entities, each entity public identity<br>
being associated during registration with a network<br>
address of the gateway, in such a way that a message<br>
according to the call control protocol and addressed to<br>
said public identity is transmitted to the gateway.<br>
In the event of reception by the gateway of a<br>
message according to the call control protocol, a step<br>
of transferring said message from the gateway to all<br>
the connected entities, and after receipt of the<br>
message by a connected entity, a step of filtering of<br>
the message by said entity, in the course of which the<br>
entity determines whether the message is addressed to<br>
the public identity allocated to it.<br>
The method which is the subject of the invention<br>
is furthermore noteworthy in that, in the case of a<br>
message according to the SIP protocol, the step of<br>
filtering the message is carried out on the basis of<br>
the content of one at least of the fields of the group<br>
comprising the field identifying the recipient of the<br>
message and the field defining the unit handling the<br>
processing of the message.<br>
The residential gateway for linking to an IP<br>
network a plurality of IP communication entities that<br>
are able to implement a call control protocol, this<br>
residential gateway connected to the IP network having<br>
available an IP network address, which is the subject<br>
of the invention, is noteworthy in that it comprises at<br>
least one module for transferring to all the IP<br>
communication entities connected to it messages<br>
 <br>
according to the call control protocol, that are<br>
received by said gateway and addressed to a public<br>
identity associated with one at least of the IP<br>
communication entities connected to the gateway.<br>
The IP communication entity to which a public<br>
identity, which is the subject of the invention, is<br>
allocated, is noteworthy in that it includes at least<br>
one message filtering module designed to determine<br>
whether a message received is addressed to the public<br>
identity allocated thereto.<br>
The IP communication entity, is furthermore<br>
noteworthy in that it is able to be integrated into a<br>
residential gateway and that it comprises means for<br>
communicating with a non-IP external communication<br>
terminal.<br>
The IP communication entity, which is the subject<br>
of the invention is finally noteworthy in that the<br>
message filtering module is designed, on receipt of a<br>
message, to analyze at least one of the fields of the<br>
group comprising a field identifying the recipient of<br>
the message and a field defining the entity handling<br>
the processing of the message, said fields being<br>
contained in the message received.<br>
The method, the residential gateway and the<br>
communication entity IP, which are the subjects of the<br>
present invention, find application to the management<br>
of the linking up of IP terminals and non-IP terminals<br>
having a public identity and triggering a call control<br>
protocol, such as domestic terminals or of a mono or<br>
multimedia local network for analog telephones,<br>
visiophones, PC personal computers, digital televisions<br>
or others that can have one and the same public<br>
identity.<br>
They will be better understood on reading the<br>
description and observing the drawings hereinafter in<br>
which, in addition to Figures la with lc relating to<br>
the prior art:<br>
 <br>
-	Figure 2a represents, by way of illustration, a<br>
flowchart of the essential steps for implementing the<br>
method which is the subject of the present invention;<br>
-	Figure 2b represents by way of illustration a<br>
flowchart according to a nonlimiting preferential mode<br>
for implementing the step of transferring the<br>
residential gateway to all the IP communication<br>
entities on the basis of the residential gateway;<br>
-	Figure 2c represents, by way of illustration, an<br>
exemplary implementation of the method for linking IP<br>
communication entities to an IP network for an<br>
installation comprising a residential gateway connected<br>
to an SIP proxy and to two IP communication entities as<br>
well as to a non-IP terminal, such as a fixed telephone<br>
handset connected to an internal IP communication<br>
entity integrated into the residential gateway, in<br>
accordance with the subject of the present invention.<br>
The method for linking to an IP network IP<br>
communication entities that are able to implement a<br>
call control protocol, by way of a local gateway, which<br>
is the subject of the invention, will now be described<br>
in a detailed manner. The IP communication entities are<br>
internal or external to the local gateway. In the<br>
particular, nonlimiting, example of the description,<br>
the call control protocol is the SIP protocol and the<br>
local gateway is a residential gateway, situated in a<br>
user's residence.<br>
In the particular example described for the<br>
implementation of the method which is the subject of<br>
the invention, we consider:<br>
-	the residential gateway, denoted Pz, z denoting<br>
the IP address of the residential gateway,<br>
-	two IP communication entities consisting of IP<br>
terminals, external to the gateway Pz and connected to<br>
the latter, and denoted Ex,pu where x denotes the IP<br>
address of the IP entity considered and pu the public<br>
identity associated with the IP entity considered,<br>
 <br>
- an IP communication entity consisting of a VEG<br>
(for VoIP Embedded Gateway) module, internal to the<br>
gateway Pz and connected to the latter, and denoted Ey,pu<br>
where y denotes the IP address of the entity considered<br>
and pu the public identity associated with the IP<br>
entity considered.<br>
Of course, the invention can be applied to any<br>
other system of this type comprising at least one<br>
residential gateway and a plurality of IP communication<br>
entities, internal or external to the gateway and<br>
connected to the latter.<br>
As will be observed in Figure 2a, the linkup<br>
method which is the subject of the invention consists,<br>
in a step A, in registering the public identity of each<br>
connected communication entity, this public identity<br>
being associated with the network address z of the<br>
gateway Pz during registration.<br>
In Figure 2a, this operation is denoted:<br>
registration {{pu}tpu, z}<br>
The aforesaid registration is performed in such a<br>
way that any message according to the call control<br>
protocol designated hereinafter, message denoted M(pu),<br>
be it a call setup request or any other message<br>
transmitted according to the call control protocol, to<br>
this public identity pu is addressed to the residential<br>
gateway Pz.<br>
Step A, following the reception of this message<br>
M(pu) by the residential gateway, is followed by a step<br>
B of transferring the message M(pu) to all the IP<br>
communication entities, internal Ex,pu or external Ey,pu<br>
to the gateway Pz and connected to the latter, from the<br>
residential gateway Pz.<br>
In step B of Figure 2a, the transfer operation is<br>
denoted:<br>
Transfer M(pu) - Ex,pu; Ey,pu.<br>
The aforesaid transfer operation B allows each of<br>
the IP communication entities internal EPx,pu or external<br>
EPy,Pu to the gateway Pz to thereafter filter the message<br>
 <br>
M(pu), so as to determine whether or not this message<br>
is addressed to a public identity allocated to it.<br>
In a general way, it is considered that the linkup<br>
process;, in accordance with the linkup method which is<br>
the subject of the invention, consists at least of<br>
steps A, B, described with Figure 2a.<br>
However, this linkup process for executing the<br>
linkup method which is the subject of the invention is<br>
then followed at the level of each IP communication<br>
entity EX/PU, Ey,pu by a filtering process in step C<br>
represented in the aforesaid Figure 2a.<br>
As will be observed in Figure 2a, for a message<br>
M(pu) each internal or external IP communication entity<br>
can undertake, in a step Co, a verification by comparing<br>
the public identity called in the message M(pu) with<br>
its own public identity allocated to it.<br>
This step is represented in step Co of Figure 2a by<br>
the test relation:<br>
pu = pu,x; pu,y ?<br>
Through the aforesaid test, it is understood that<br>
each internal or external IP communication entity that<br>
is a recipient of the message M(pu) undertakes an<br>
identification in the aforesaid step C0.<br>
On a negative response to the test of the<br>
aforesaid step Co, the internal or external IP<br>
communication entity considered in step C2 ignores the<br>
message.<br>
Conversely on a positive response to the test of<br>
step C0, that is to say in the event of identity between<br>
the public identity called in the message received and<br>
the public identity allocated to the internal or<br>
external IP communication entity considered, step C0 is<br>
followed by a step C1 of processing the aforesaid<br>
message M(pu). In a specific manner, it is indicated<br>
that the process for filtering the messages received,<br>
these messages having been transmitted according to the<br>
SIP protocol, consists in determining, for each message<br>
received by an IP communication entity, whether the<br>
 <br>
message: is addressed to the public identity allocated<br>
to this IP communication entity either on the basis of<br>
the field identifying the recipient of the message,<br>
that is to say the field denoted by field "To"<br>
according to the SIP protocol, or on the basis of the<br>
field defining the unit handling the processing of the<br>
message, that is to say on the basis of the field<br>
denoted "REQUEST URI" according to the SIP protocol.<br>
When the internal or external IP communication<br>
entity EX/PU Ey,pu is recognized to be a recipient for<br>
example of a request, the latter performs the<br>
processing associated with the reception of the<br>
aforesaid request, this processing being able to<br>
consist for example in the fact of ringing on receipt<br>
of a call setup request, the ring occurring either at<br>
the level of the IP communication entity, or conversely<br>
at the level of the non-IP terminal when the latter is<br>
linked to an internal IP communication entity<br>
associated with it.<br>
Otherwise, as is represented in Figure 2a, the<br>
call setup request M(pu) is then ignored.<br>
More specifically, the transfer step B of Figure<br>
2a, is executed by transferring the message M(pu) over<br>
the IP network to each of the external IP communication<br>
entities connected on the basis of the residential<br>
gateway Pz.<br>
Conversely, in the case where the gateway<br>
comprises and integrates internal IP communication<br>
entities to which non-IP terminals are linked, the<br>
residential gateway Pz forwards the aforesaid messages<br>
M(pu) to each of the corresponding internal modules<br>
VEG, as if it were in fact an IP terminal. The IP<br>
communication entity invoked then processes the message<br>
M(pu) in the same way as would an IP terminal.<br>
A more detailed description of the transmission<br>
operation B of Figure 2a will be now given in<br>
conjunction with Figure 2b, this transmission operation<br>
 <br>
being performed at the level of the residential gateway<br>
Pz.<br>
In a general manner, it is indicated, by way of<br>
nonlimiting example, that the registration operation A<br>
can be performed by the network, this operation being<br>
described subsequently in the description.<br>
Under these conditions, the registration proper of<br>
the whole set of public identities denoted {{pu}tPu, z}<br>
associated with the network address z of the<br>
residential gateway Pz is available at the level of the<br>
aforesaid performed registration.<br>
More specifically, during the transmission of a<br>
call setup request M(pu), this request is transmitted<br>
by way of an item of network equipment ER formed by an<br>
SIP proxy when the SIP protocol is implemented, this<br>
item of network equipment ER being associated, inter<br>
alia with the gateway Pz and making it possible to<br>
manage this gateway Pz.<br>
With reference to Figure 2b, the item of network<br>
equipment ER proceeds on receipt of the message M(pu)<br>
to the recovery of the network address z of the<br>
residential gateway Pz by identifying the public<br>
identity called pu, on the basis of the registration<br>
previously mentioned, in sub-step B0 of Figure 2b.<br>
The item of network equipment ER then proceeds in<br>
sub-step B1 to the transmission to the residential<br>
gateway Pz of the message M(pu) at the address z which<br>
was recovered in the previous step B0.<br>
On receipt of the message M(pu) by the residential<br>
gateway Pz, the latter, in sub-step B2/ undertakes the<br>
transfer of the message M(pu) to the whole set of IP<br>
communication entities internal or external to the<br>
platform Pz and connected to the latter.<br>
A more detailed description of the operative mode<br>
of the linkup method, which is the subject of the<br>
invention, will be now given in conjunction with Figure<br>
2c in a nonlimiting specific domestic configuration<br>
given solely by way of example.<br>
 <br>
The initial domestic configuration represented in<br>
Figure 2c is considered in particular, in which the<br>
gateway Pz whose IP network address is z = "1.1.1.4"<br>
links two terminals associated with one and the same<br>
public identity consisting of a telephone number + 33<br>
14 52 94 814.<br>
The first terminal, terminal of non-IP type, is<br>
represented by an internal VEG module, constituting an<br>
internal IP communication entity having an IP address y<br>
= "10.1.1.1".<br>
The second terminal of IP communication entity<br>
type external to the gateway Pz and linked to the latter<br>
has a network address x = "10.1.1.2".<br>
As furthermore represented in Figure 2c, the<br>
gateway Pz also links a third terminal, of external IP<br>
communication entity type, whose public identity is<br>
different + 33 14 52 96 496 and having a network<br>
address x = "10.1.1.3".<br>
In accordance with a noteworthy aspect of the<br>
method which is the subject of the invention, step A<br>
consisting in performing the registration can<br>
advantageously include the creation of a location<br>
database DB of the association between the set of first<br>
and second aforesaid public identities and of the IP<br>
address of the residential gateway Pz.<br>
In Figure 2c it is understood that the aforesaid<br>
registration comprises the public identities + 33 14 52<br>
94 814 and + 33 14 52 96 496 referred to as numbers<br>
associated with the target, that is to say with the IP<br>
address of the residential gateway z = "1.1.1.4".<br>
For the implementation of the aforesaid<br>
registration several operative modes can be performed.<br>
The aforesaid registration can, for example, be<br>
configured by default in the location database DB upon<br>
the user's subscription to the telephone service.<br>
This registration can also be dynamic according to<br>
the mechanism defined by the standard RFC32 61 of the<br>
SIP protocol (for Session Initiation Protocol). Under<br>
 <br>
this assumption each terminal transmits a "REGISTER"<br>
request to the network, the contact address contained<br>
in these request messages corresponding to the contact<br>
address of the residential gateway.<br>
In the example given in conjunction with Figure<br>
2c, during a call phase for example, the item of<br>
network equipment ER responsible for the residential<br>
gateway Pz receives a message constituting a request to<br>
set up a call M(pu) destined for a public identity, the<br>
number + 33 14 52 94 814 previously described. The item<br>
of network equipment ER formed by the SIP proxy<br>
recovers from the location database DB the network<br>
address z associated with this public identity and<br>
retransmits the call setup message to this address z.<br>
The residential gateway Pz receiving this message<br>
forwards it immediately to the internal or external IP<br>
communication SIP entities that it links.<br>
The IP terminals and the IP termination then<br>
examine the SIP field "To" of this request, that is to<br>
say the field containing the public identity of the<br>
requested terminal, so as to determine whether this<br>
request is or is not intended for them.<br>
The two SIP external or internal IP communication<br>
entities responding to the number + 33 14 52 94 814<br>
then deduce from this analysis that the request is<br>
intended for them and ring, while the IP communication<br>
entity associated with the number + 33 14 52 96 496<br>
ignores the aforesaid request message.<br>
The rest of the call setup is performed as defined<br>
in the standard RFC3261.<br>
The chronology of the messages transmitted between<br>
the network entity ER formed by the SIP proxy, the<br>
residential gateway Pz and each of the IP communication<br>
entities represented in Figure 2c is as follows:<br>
1: INVITE; To + 33 14 52 94 814<br>
2: DB Interrogation<br>
3: INVITE; 1.1.1.4; To + 33 14 52 94 814<br>
4a: Redirection; 1.1.1.4; + 33 14 52 94 814 to VEG<br>
 <br>
4b: INVITE; 1.1.1.4; To + 33 14 52 94 814 to<br>
10.1.1.2<br>
4c: INVITE; 1.1.1.4; To + 33 14 52 96 496 to<br>
10.1.1.3<br>
A more detailed description of a residential<br>
gateway for linking to the IP network a plurality of<br>
internal or external IP communication entities that are<br>
able to implement a call control protocol, this<br>
residential gateway connected to the IP network having<br>
an IP address, in accordance with the subject of the<br>
present invention, will be now given in conjunction<br>
with Figure 2c.<br>
As represented in Figure 2c, the residential<br>
gateway Pz includes at least one transfer module denoted<br>
TM with the function of forwarding to all the IP<br>
communication entities, internal or external to the<br>
gateway Pz and connected to the latter, the messages<br>
received by the gateway Pz, and addressed to at least<br>
one among the plurality of public identities<br>
respectively associated with these connected IP<br>
communication entities.<br>
It is indicated that the aforesaid transfer module<br>
TM can consist of a software module making it possible<br>
to simply ensure the redirection of the message M(pu)<br>
to any internal IP communication entity, such as a VEG<br>
module associated with a non-IP terminal, as previously<br>
described in conjunction with Figure 2c, or,<br>
conversely, the transmission by network, that is to say<br>
by transmission of an "INVITE" message within the<br>
framework of the SIP protocol to any external IP<br>
communication entity connected to the aforesaid<br>
residential gateway Pz. These "INVITE" messages are<br>
messages 4b and 4c of the figure previously mentioned<br>
in the description.<br>
The external respectively internal IP<br>
communication entity having a public identity and an IP<br>
address, in accordance with the subject of the present<br>
invention, is noteworthy in that each of these latter<br>
 <br>
includes a module FM for filtering the messages M(pu)<br>
received, whose function is to determine, for each<br>
message received, whether this message is addressed to<br>
the public identity allocated to the IP communication<br>
entity considered.<br>
This filtering module can consist of a software<br>
module installed directly in the IP communication<br>
entity considered and in particular in the VEG module<br>
integrated into the residential gateway Pz.<br>
When the filtering module FM is integrated into<br>
the VEG module, that is to say into the IP<br>
communication entity internal to the gateway Pz, this IP<br>
communication entity advantageously comprises a module<br>
for communicating with a non-IP terminal external to<br>
the gateway Pz. The role of this communication module is<br>
to ensure connection of the VEG module, internal to the<br>
gateway Pz, to the non-IP terminal, external to the<br>
gateway Pz, as well as communication between the VEG<br>
module and the non-IP terminal.<br>
As previously mentioned within the framework of<br>
the description of the method which is the subject of<br>
the invention, it is indicated that the filtering<br>
module FM executes an evaluation either of the field<br>
identifying the recipient of the message, or of the<br>
field defining the unit handling the processing of this<br>
message.<br>
As mentioned previously in the description, it is<br>
either the field "To" of the SIP messages or conversely<br>
the field defining the unit handling the processing for<br>
example the field comprising the network address<br>
"10.1.1.1" of the internal IP communication entity<br>
consisting of the VEG module integrated into the<br>
gateway Pz represented in Figure 2c, for the non-IP<br>
terminal associated with it.<br>
The invention also covers a computer program for a<br>
residential gateway comprising instructions able to<br>
control the transferring, by the gateway, of a message<br>
according to a call control protocol received by the<br>
 <br>
gateway, to all the IP communication entities connected<br>
to it, when the program is executed by the gateway.<br>
This program can be stored in or transmitted by a data<br>
medium. The latter can be a hardware storage medium,<br>
for example a CD-ROM, a magnetic diskette or a hard<br>
disk, or else a transmissible medium such as an<br>
electrical, optical or radio signal.<br>
It is of course understood that the corresponding<br>
program product is then stored either by downloading or<br>
in any other way at the residential gateway Pz level and<br>
in particular in the transfer module TM represented in<br>
Figure 2c.<br>
The invention also covers a computer program for<br>
an IP communication entity, such as previously<br>
described, to which a public identity is allocated,<br>
comprising instructions for executing a filtering of<br>
the messages according to a call control protocol<br>
received by said entity so as to determine whether<br>
these messages are addressed to the public identity of<br>
said entity, when the program is executed by the IP<br>
communication entity. This program can be stored in or<br>
transmitted by a data medium. The latter can be a<br>
hardware storage medium, for example a CD-ROM, a<br>
magnetic diskette or a hard disk, or else a<br>
transmissible medium such as an electrical, optical or<br>
radio signal.<br>
In the preceding description, the messages are<br>
transmitted to the residential gateway according to the<br>
SIP protocol. The invention also applies to the<br>
transmission of messages according to the H323 protocol<br>
or according to any other call control protocol<br>
designed to be implemented by IP communication<br>
entities, connected to the IP network but each<br>
comprising a public identity which is allocated to<br>
them, and distinguishing between the concept of public<br>
identity and that of network address. To go back to the<br>
particular example of the H323 protocol, this protocol<br>
also envisages a registration phase making it possible<br>
 <br>
to register in the network the correspondence between a<br>
user's public identity and the network address of his<br>
location point in the network. It therefore suffices to<br>
register, during this registration phase and via<br>
messages defined by the H323 protocol, the<br>
correspondence between the network address, in this<br>
instance the IP address, of the residential gateway and<br>
the respective public identities associated with the IP<br>
communication entities that it links. The role of the<br>
residential gateway is then to forward all the<br>
messages, in particular the SETUP call setup requests<br>
as defined by the H323 protocol, that it receives to<br>
all the H323 entities that it links. In the same way as<br>
in the case of the SIP protocol, each entity H323 is<br>
left to handle the operation of filtering the messages<br>
received so as to determine, for each message received,<br>
whether or not it is intended for the entity<br>
considered.<br>
 <br>
