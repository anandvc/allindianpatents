An improved process for the preparation of Montelukast and its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of [R-<br><br>
Formula (I).<br><br>
Montelukast sodium is a leukotriene antagonist and is useful in the treatment of Asthma and as well as other conditions mediated by leukotrienes, such as inflammation and allergies.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br><br>
pyran with Methyl l-(acetylthiomethyl) cyclopropane acetate in presence of hydrazine, cesium carbonate in acetonitrile as solvent to get methyl ester of Montelukast in pyran protected form. The protected compound is further reacted with pyridinium p-toluene sulfonate, sodium hydroxide in a mixture of methanol and tetrahydrofuran as a solvent to afford Montelukast sodium of Formula (I).<br>
US 5,614,632 discloses the preparation of l-(mercapto methyl) cyclopropane acetic acid, which is a key intermediate for the preparation of Montelukast sodium. The said patent claimed an improved process for the preparation of Montelukast sodium including the process for the preparation of its key intermediates. The process comprises, the generation of dilithium dianion of l-(mercaptomethyl) cyclopropaneacetic acid and then<br><br>
3-hydroxy propyl) benzoate with methyl magnesium chloride to give diol, which is further converted to mesylated alcohol on reaction with methanol sulfonyl chloride. The process for the preparation of above described benzoate is disclosed in EP 480717 (example 146, step-2), which involves the usage of (-)B-chloro diisopinocamphenylborane as achiral reducing agent. The said patent also claims the process for the preparation of crystalline Montelukast sodium salt.<br><br>
Many other related patents discloses the process for the preparation of Montelukast and its intermediates but none of those patents are related to the process of the present invention. The prior art procedures involves more number of steps which includes the protection and further deprotection of diol intermediate, the usage of hazardous and costly raw materials such as n-butyl lithium in typical rections i.e., at very low temperatures (-25°C). The processes of the prior art references involve tedious workup to isolate the required product and thus results in excess time cycle, which in turn rendering the process more costly and less eco friendly thus the process is not recommendable for commercial scale up.<br>
As the Montelukast sodium of Formula (I), which is useful in the treatment of Asthma, hence, it is important to have a cost effective and commercially viable process for preparing the compound of Formula (I).<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to prepare Montelukast sodium in an improved method, which is cost-effective, commercially viable and non-hazardous. The Montelukast sodium is prepared in the present invention; in an improved process that is cost effective and the Montelukast sodium obtained in this process is suitable for pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art processes<br>
•	Usage of n-Butyl lithium is leading to increase the cost of the product and which is highly flammable and dangerous, it needs special equipment to handle the reagent, needs personal attention throughout the process.<br>
•	Usage of sodium hydroxide for the preparation of Montelukast sodium (formula-I) from Montelukast produces water as by product it leads to formation of gummy material so removal of water is essential this leads to prolonged process.<br>
•	Prior art processes teaches conversion of Montelukast amine salt to Montelukast free acid then converting to its sodium salt needs more time.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of Montelukast and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, preferably sodium salt. The improved process of the present invention comprises;<br>
Reacting (S) Benzenepropanol α-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl]phenyl]-2-(l-hydroxy-1-methyl ethyl)-α-methane sulfonate compound of formula (II) with 1-(mercapto methyl) cyclo propane acetic acid compound of formula (III) in presence of alkali or alkaline carbonates like cesium carbonate or strong base like alkali or alkaline earth metal alkoxide i.e,. potassium tertiary butoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, in a suitable polar aprotic solvent with or without combination of C1-C4 alcoholic solvents like methanol, ethnaol, preferably methanol and then treating with an organic amine of general formula R-NH2 in a suitable solvent selected from keto solvents like acetone, butanone or ester solvents like ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, preferably acetone and ethylacetate gives corresponding amine salt of Montelukast compound of formula (IV) and then converting compound of corresponding amine salt of Montelukast into its sodium salt of Formula (I) (Montelukast sodium) using sodium source in methanol.<br>
Advantages over prior art processes<br>
•	The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of Montelukast sodium using a simple base like sodium methoxide or potassium tertiary butoxide in place of n-butyl lithium which is easy to handle it does not need any special equipment.<br>
•	Usage of sodium methoxide for the preparation of Montelukast sodium (formula-I) from Montelukast produces methanol as by product and removal of methanol is very easy and it gives the free flow powder.<br><br>
•	Present invention provides process for the preparation of Montelukast sodium<br>
without conversion of Montelukast amine salt to Montelukast free acid, it leads to<br>
reduction of cycle time.<br>
•	Highest yield obtained while using cesium carbonate.<br>
•	Introducing the toluene/hexanes washings after completion of the condensation<br>
reaction to remove impurities, which avoids purification at organic amine salt stage.<br>
•	Cost effective process, and reduction of cycle time.<br>
•	Environment friendly and easy scalable process.<br>
