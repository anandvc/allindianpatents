				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Disclosed is a method to manufacture high purity acetic acid. Although described in relation to that produced by a low water carbonylation process the present invention is applicable to other mechanisms for production of acetic acid which results in formation of permanganate reducing compounds such as acetaldehyde and its derivatives, and alkyl iodide impurities in intermediate process streams. It has been found that permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides may be conveniently removed from a light phase of an intermediate stream in the reaction process by employing a multiple distillation process coupled with an optional post extraction of acetaldehyde. The distillation process involves first distilling a light phase to concentrate the permanganate reducing compounds, and in particular the acetaldehyde, and then separating the permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides in a second distillation tower. The second distillation serves to remove the permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides from methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and methanol mixture. As an optional third step, the twice distilled stream may be directed to an extractor to recover any remaining quantities of methyl iodide from the aqueous acetaldehyde waste stream. This process affords a final product in greater than 99% purity. It has been found that this process reduces and/or removes at least 50% of the permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides and at least 20% of the propionic acid impurity from the intermediate light phase stream, and results in lower alkyl iodide concentration in the carbonylation reaction process, and in particular in the carbonylation reactor. It has also been found that during shut down of the inventive process, higher molecular weight polymers of acetaldehyde tend to form in the base of the second distillation tower. To avoid or minimize the formation of these polymers, a constant flow of solvent is passed through the base of the column.</td>

no.l852/Cal/97 of 1.10.97.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel process for the removal of<br>
permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides formed by<br>
the carbony 1 at ion of methanol in the presence of a Group VIII<br>
metal carbonylation catalyst. More specifically, this invention<br>
relates to a novel process for reducing and/or removing<br>
precursors of permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl iodides<br>
from intermediate streams during the formation of acetic acid<br>
by said carbonylation processes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Among currently employed processes for synthesizing acetic acid<br>
one of the most useful commercially is the catalyzed<br>
carbonylation of methanol with carbon monoxide as taught in<br>
US 3,769,329 issued to Paulik et al on October 30, 1973. The<br>
carbonylation catalyst comprises rhodium, either dissolved or<br>
otherwise dispersed in a liquid reaction medium or else supported<br>
on an inert solid, along with a halogen containing catalyst<br>
promoter as exemplified by methyl iodide. The rhodium can be<br>
introduced into the reaction system in any of many forms, and<br>
it is not relevant, if indeed it is possible, to identify the<br>
exact nature of the rhodium moiety within the active catalyst<br>
complex. Likewise, the nature of the halide promoter is not<br>
critical. The patentees disclose a very large number of suitable<br>
promoters , most of which are organic iodides. Mo st typically<br>
and usefully, the reaction is conducted with the catalyst being<br>
dissolved in a liquid reaction medium through which carbon<br>
monoxide gas is continuously bubbled.<br>
An improvement in the prior art process for the car bony 1 at i on<br>
of an aicohol to produce the carboxylic acid having one carbon<br>
atom more than the alcohol in the presence of a rhodium catalyst<br>
is disclosed in conrmonly assigned US Patent Nos.5,001,259, issued<br>
March 19, 1991; 5,026,908, issued june 25, 1991 and 5,144,068,<br>
issued September 1, 1992 and European patent 161,874 B2,<br>
published July 1, 1992. As disclosed therein acetic acid is<br>
produced from methanol in a reaction medium comprising methyl<br>
acetate, methyl halide, especially methyl iodide, and rhodium<br>
present in a catalytical1y effectie concentration. The invention<br>
therein resides primarily in the discovery that catalyst<br>
stability and the productivity of the carbonylation reactor<br>
can be maintained at surprisingly high levels, even at very<br>
low water concentrations, i.e 4 weight (wt ) % or less, in the<br>
reaction medium (despite the general industrial practice of<br>
maintaining approximately 14 wt % or 15 wt % water) by<br>
maintaining in the reaction medium, along with a catalytical1y<br>
effective amount of rhodium, at least a finite concentration<br>
of water, methyl acetate and methyl iodide, a specified<br>
concentration of iodide ions over and above the iodide content<br>
which is present as methyl iodide or other organic iodide. The<br>
iodide ion is present as a simple salt, with lithium iodide<br>
being preferred. The patents teach that the concentration of<br>
methyl acetate and iodide salts are significant parameters in<br>
affecting the rate of carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic<br>
acid especially at low reactor water concentrations. By using<br>
relatively high concentrations of the methyl acetate and iodide<br>
salt, one obtains a surprising degree of catalyst stability<br>
and reactor productivity even when the liquid reaction medium<br>
contains water in concentrations as low as about 0.1 wt%, so<br>
low that it can broadly be defined simply as "a finite<br>
concentration" of water. Furthermore, the reaction medium<br>
employed improves the stability of the rhodium catalyst, i.e.<br>
resistance to catalyst precipitation, especially during the<br>
product recovery steps of the process wherein distillation for<br>
the purpose of recovering the acetic acid product tends to remove<br>
from the catalyst the carbon monoxide which in the environment<br>
maintained in the reaction vessel, is a ligand with stabilizing<br>
effect on the rhodium. US Patent Nos.5,001,259, 5,026,908 and<br>
5,144,068 are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
It has been found that a low water carbony 1 at i on process for<br>
the production of acetic acid reduces such by-products as carbon<br>
dioxide, hydrogen, and propionic acid. However, the amount of<br>
other impurities, present generally in trace amounts, is also<br>
increased, and the quality of acetic acid sometimes suffers<br>
when attempts are made to increase the production rate by<br>
improving catalysts, or modifying reaction conditions. These<br>
trace impurities affect quality of acetic acid, especially when<br>
they are recirculated through the reaction process. Among the<br>
impurities, which decrease the permanganate time of the acetic<br>
acid, are carbonyl compounds, and unsaturated carbonyl compounds.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "carbonyl" is intended to mean<br>
compounds which contain aldehyde or ketone functional groups<br>
which compounds may or may not possess unsaturation. See<br>
Catalysis of Organic Reaction, 75,369-380 (1998), for further<br>
discussion on impurities in a carbonylation reaction system.<br>
The present invention is directed to reduction and/or removal<br>
of permanganate reducing compounds (PRC's) such as acetadehyde,<br>
acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, butyraldehyde, crotonaldehyde,<br>
2-ethyl crotonaldehyde, and 2-ethyl butyraldehyde and the like,<br>
and the aldol condensation products thereof. It also leads to<br>
reduction of propionic acid. Reduction of other impurities<br>
include alkyl iodides such as ethyl iodide, propyl iodide, butyl<br>
iodide, pentyl iodide, hexyl iodide, and the like.<br>
It is desirable to remove alkyl iodides from the reaction product<br>
since traces of these impurities (in the acetic acid product)<br>
tend to poison the catalyst used in the production of vinyl<br>
acetate, the product most commonly produced from acetic acid.<br>
The present invention is thus also directed to removal of alkyl<br>
iodides, in particular C2-C12 alkyl iodide compounds. The carbonyl<br>
impurities may further react with iodide catalyst promoters<br>
to form multi-carbon alkyl iodides, e.g., ethyl iodide, butyl<br>
iodide, hexyl iodide and the like. Since many impurities<br>
originate with acetaldehyde, it is therefore a primary objective<br>
to remove or reduce the acetaldehyde and alkyl iodide content<br>
in the reaction system.<br>
Conventional techniques to remove impurities include treatment<br>
of acetic acid with oxidizers, ozone, water, methanol, activated-<br>
carbon, amines, and the like, which treatment may or may not<br>
be combined with distillation of the acetic acid. The most<br>
typical purification treatment involves a series of distillations<br>
of the final product. It is known to remove carbonyl impurities<br>
from organic streams by treating the organic streams with an<br>
amine compound such as hydroxyl amine which reacts with the<br>
carbonyl compounds to form oximes followed by distillation to<br>
separate the purified organic product from the oxime reaction<br>
products. However, the additional treatment of the final product<br>
adds cost to the process and it has been found that distillation<br>
of the treated acetic acid product can result in additional<br>
impurities being formed.<br>
While it is possible to obtain acetic acid of relatively high<br>
purity, the acetic acid product formed by the above described<br>
low water carbonylation process and purification treatment,<br>
frequently remains deficient with respect to the permanganate<br>
time. This is due to the presence therein of small proportions<br>
of residual impurities. Since a sufficient permanganate time<br>
is an important commercial test, which the acid product must<br>
meet for many uses, the presence therein of such impurities<br>
that decrease permanganate time is objectionable. The removal<br>
of minute quantities of these impurities from the acetic acid<br>
by conventional treatment and distillation techniques is not<br>
economically or corrmercially feasible by distillation since<br>
the impurities have boiling points close to that of the acetic<br>
acid product.<br>
It is important to determine where in the carbonylation process<br>
impurities can be removed. It is also important to determine<br>
by what economically viable process impurities can be removed<br>
without risk of further contamination to the final product or<br>
unnecessary added costs. JP patent application 5-169205<br>
discloses a method for manufacture of high purity acetic acid<br>
by adjusting the acetaldehyde concentration of the reaction<br>
solution below 150 0 ppm. By maintaining the acetaldehyde<br>
concentration in the reaction solution below 1500 ppm, it is<br>
stated that it is possible to suppress the formation of<br>
impurities and manufacture high purity acetic acid by performing<br>
only basic distillation operations during purification of the<br>
crude acetic acid formed.<br>
EP 487,284, B1, published April 12, 1995, states that carbonyl<br>
impurities present in the acetic acid product generally<br>
concentrate in the overhead from the light ends column.<br>
Accordingly, the light ends column overhead is treated with<br>
an amine compound i.e, hydroxy 1 amine which reacts with the<br>
carbonyl compounds to allow such carbonyls to be separated from<br>
the remaining overhead by distillation, resulting in an acetic<br>
acid product which has improved permanganate time.<br>
EP 0 687 662 A2 describes a process for producing high purity<br>
acetic acid whereby an acetaldehyde concentration of 400 ppm<br>
or less is maintained in the reactor by removal thereof using<br>
a single or multi-stage distillation process. Streams suggested<br>
for processing to remove acetaldehyde include a light phase<br>
comprising primarily water, acetic acid and methyl acetate;<br>
a heavy phase comprising primarily methyl iodide, methyl acetate<br>
and acetic acid; an overhead stream comprising primarily methyl<br>
iodide and methyl acetate; or a recirculating stream comprising<br>
the light and heavy phase combined. Although four streams are<br>
suggested for processing, the reference teaches and exemplifies<br>
use of the heavy phase. No teaching or suggestion is given<br>
regarding which stream(s) possesses the greatest concentration<br>
of acetaldehyde.<br>
Also disclosed in EP'662 is management of reaction conditions<br>
to control the formation of acetaldehyde in the reactor. By<br>
controlling the formation of acetaldehyde, it is stated that<br>
reduction of by-products such as crotonaldehyde,<br>
2-ethylcrotonaldehyde, and alkyl iodides are reduced. However,<br>
it is pointed out that management of reaction conditions "have<br>
a defect to increase a by-production speed of propionic acid"<br>
indicating that propionic acid is a problem with the disclosed<br>
process of '662.<br>
Hence, EP'662 describes optimization of reaction conditions<br>
to avoid formation of acetaldehyde as well as removal of any<br>
acetaldehyde beyond a level of 400 ppm formed in the reactor.<br>
While the above-described processes have been successful in<br>
removing carbonyl impurities from the carbonylation system and<br>
for the most part controlling acetaldehyde levels and<br>
permanganate time problems in the final acetic acid product,<br>
further improvements can still be made. There remains a need<br>
to determine where in the carbonylation process the permanganate<br>
reducing compounds, and in particular, acetaldehyde and alkyl<br>
iodides are most concentrated and therefore can be reduced or<br>
removed so as to insure consistent purity of product. At the<br>
same time, there remains a need to provide a process for<br>
reduction/removal of such carbonyl materials and iodide compounds<br>
without sacrificing the productivity of the car bonylation process<br>
or without incurring substantial additional operating costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been discovered that a light ends phase from the<br>
light ends distillation column contains carbonyl-containing<br>
permanganate reducing compounds, and in particular acetaldehyde<br>
which may be further concentrated and removed from the process.<br>
In one aspect of this invention, the light ends phase is<br>
distilled twice, once through a distillation column which serves<br>
to separate the acetaldehyde, methyl iodide, and methyl acetate<br>
from acetic acid and water. The second distillation column serves<br>
to separate acetaldehyde from methyl iodide and methyl acetate<br>
and essentially serves to concentrate and purge the acetaldehyde<br>
from the process. Optionally, in another aspect of the invention,<br>
the resulting distillate from the second distillation is directed<br>
to an extractor to separate out concentrated acetaldehyde and<br>
return a residual saturated organic iodide solution to the<br>
carbonyl at ion reaction system.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, alkyl iodide compounds,<br>
in particular C2-12, may be removed or significantly reduced<br>
employing the described dual distillation process.<br>
It has been found that when shutting down the car bony 1 at i on<br>
system, in particular the distillation columns employed in the<br>
present process, polymers of acetaldehyde, in particular higher<br>
molecular weight polymers tend to form and build up in the base<br>
of the second column. Another aspect of the present invention<br>
describes a method to deal with this problem. It has been found<br>
that a constant flow of solvent to maintain contact between<br>
the stream within the second distillation column and a solvent<br>
from an internal stream (such as one that contains a large<br>
percentage of acetic acid or methyl acetate) results in a<br>
polymer-free column base upon shut down of the unit. By having<br>
the base devoid of polymer build up, one may shut down and<br>
subsequently start up the column in a relatively trouble free,<br>
efficient, and cost-effective manner.<br>
The present invention utilizes a light phase, which is an<br>
internal, intermediate stream in the process, instead of a heavy<br>
phase (as suggested in EP'662), for reduction, or removal of<br>
PRC's, their precursors and alkyl iodide compounds. The art<br>
traditionally employs a heavy phase for treatment or removal<br>
of carbonyl impurities and in particular, removal of acetal-<br>
dehyde. To date, the art was not aware that light phase was<br>
the better option compared to the heavy phase to reduce PRC's<br>
and alkyl iodides. Generally, the art employs an extractor before<br>
the second distillation; it has been found that the use of an<br>
extractor after the second distillation (or a post-extractor<br>
process) results in greater removal of acetaldehyde. It has<br>
also been found that due to the dual distillation process,<br>
coupled with the post extractor, a very concentrated acetaldehyde<br>
stream with essentially no methyl iodide is purged from the<br>
process. It has been found that the formation of meta-and<br>
paraldehyde in the second column, as well as higher molecular<br>
weight polymers thereof, can be inhibited or suppressed by the<br>
use of an internal stream comprising approximately 70 wt% water<br>
and 30 wt% acetic acid. Because the stream is internal, to the<br>
process, it does not place an added water load to the process.<br>
It has further been found that the recycle of the first column's<br>
residue to the light ends column decanter can be used to extract<br>
more PRC's from the heavy phase into the light phase and thus<br>
improve acetic acid product quality overall.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed<br>
towards a process for reduction and/or removal of permanganate<br>
reducing compounds, their precursors, and C2-12 alkyl iodide<br>
compounds formed in the carbonylation of methanol to a product<br>
of acetic acid, wherein said methanol is carbonylated in a<br>
suitable liquid phase reaction medium comprising a Group VIII<br>
metal catalyst, an organic iodide and iodide salt catalyst<br>
promoter, the products of said car bony 1 at ion are separated into<br>
a volatile phase comprising product, and a less volatile phase<br>
comprising Group VIII metal catalyst, acetic acid, and iodide<br>
catalyst promoter; said product phase distilled in a distillation<br>
tower to yield a purified product and an overhead comprising<br>
organic iodide, methyl acetate, water, acetic acid, and unreacted<br>
me thanol, directing at least a portion of the overhead to an<br>
overhead receiver decanter which separates the overhead into<br>
a light phase, comprising acetic acid and water, and a heavy<br>
phase comprising methyl acetate and organic iodide; and recycling<br>
the heavy phase to the carbonylation reactor, the improvement<br>
which comprises<br>
(a) directing the light phase comprising acetic acid and water<br>
to a distiller which separates the mixture into two streams:<br>
residue stream (1) comprising primarily water and acetic acid,<br>
and overhead stream 2) comprising methyl iodide, methyl acetate,<br>
methanol, C2-12 alkyl iodides, and permanganate reducing<br>
compounds (PRC's);<br>
(b) circulating stream (1) of step (a) to further processing<br>
and ultimately back to the reaction system, and stream (2) of<br>
step (a) to a second distiller which serves to strip the PRC's<br>
and alkyl iodides from the mixture;<br>
(c) optionally, forwarding the over head stream containing PRC's<br>
or precursors thereof of step (b) to an extractor and,<br>
(d) separating out concentrated PRC's and alkyl iodides for<br>
disposal and returning the organic iodide phase of (b) or (c)<br>
as a stream containing a lower percentage of PRC's precursors,<br>
and/or C2-12 alkyl iodides to the carbonylation reaction system.<br>
The bulk of the overhead from the light phase is recycled to<br>
the reactor. Thus, in accordance with the present invention,<br>
the inventory of PRC's including acetaldehyde, and alkyl iodides<br>
is greatly reduced by this multiple distillation plus optional<br>
post extraction process and, at the same time, accomplishing<br>
such product quality without substantially increasing the cost<br>
of production.<br>
It has been found that PRC's, in particular acetaldehyde,<br>
crotonaldehyde, and 2-ethyl crotonaldehyde, and alkyl iodides,<br>
in particular hexyl iodide, are reduced by at least 50%, usually<br>
greater than that, employing the inventive process. Additionally,<br>
propionic acid has been reduced, usually greater than 20%, most<br>
often greater than 30% and 40%, and total iodides have been<br>
reduced by a percentage reduction of about 50%, most often<br>
greater than 60%. The permanganate time has been observed to<br>
increase by a percentage of about 50%, usually greater than<br>
7 0% with the inventive process.<br>
Once the inventive process was operational and shut down of<br>
the system was on going, it was discovered that polymers of<br>
acetaldehyde, in particular, polymers having a molecular weight<br>
greater than about 1000, tended to build up in the second column<br>
and plug the column. The polymers were found to be viscous,<br>
and thixotropic and tended to adhere to the walls of the column.<br>
Upon heating, these polymers tended to crystallize and harden<br>
along the walls of the column, making them very difficult to<br>
remove. It was found that this problem could be avoided by<br>
contacting the stream flowing through the second distillation<br>
column with solvent stream flow in an amount sufficient and<br>
at a flow rate sufficient to avoid aldol condensation polymer<br>
formation or to avoid formation of polymers of acetaldehyde.<br>
The solvent may be selected from acetic acid, methyl acetate,<br>
methanol, water, methyl iodide and the like or combinations<br>
thereof with acetic acid being preferred in view of the abundance<br>
of an internal stream to utilize. Generally, amounts sufficient<br>
to avoid aldol condensation reactions from occurring are rates<br>
of about 0.25-5 gallon per minute (gpm), preferably about 0.5-<br>
2 gpm with most preferable rate being about 1 gpm. It is<br>
undesirable to use an excess of solvent since this places a<br>
greater load on the system to reprocess the excess solvent.<br>
Although various positions of ingress of the solvent are<br>
acceptable, it is preferred that the solvent be contacted with<br>
the stream in the second distillation column at the base of<br>
the column.<br>
ACCOMPANYING/DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment for the removal<br>
of carbonyl impurities from an intermediate stream of the<br>
carbonylation process for the production of acetic acid by a<br>
car bonylation reaction.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The purification process of the present invention is useful<br>
in any process used to carbonylate methanol to acetic acid in<br>
the presence of a Group VIII metal catalyst such as rhodium<br>
and an iodide promoter. A particularly useful process is the<br>
low water rhodium catalyzed car bony 1 at ion of methanol to acetic<br>
acid as exemplified in aforementioned US Patent No.5,001,259.<br>
Generally, the rhodium component of the catalyst system is<br>
believed to be present in the form of a coordination compound<br>
of rhodium with a halogen component providing at least one of<br>
the ligands of such coordination compound. In addition to the<br>
coordination of rhodium and halogen, it is also believed that<br>
carbon monoxide coordinates with rhodium. The rhodium compound<br>
of the catalyst system may be provided by introducing into the<br>
reaction zone rhodium in the form of rhodium metal, rhodium<br>
salts such as the oxides, acetates, iodides, etc., or other<br>
coordination compounds of rhodium, and the like.<br>
The halogen-promoting component of the catalyst system consists<br>
of a halogen compound comprising an organic halide. Thus, alkyl,<br>
aryl, and substituted alkyl or aryl halides can be used.<br>
Preferably, the halide promoter is present in the form of an<br>
alkyl halide in which the alkyl radical corresponds to the arkyl<br>
radical of the feed alcohol, which is car bonylated. Thus, in<br>
the carbonylation of methanol to acetic acid, the halide promoter<br>
will comprise methyl halide, and mo re preferably methyl iodide.<br>
The liquid reaction medium employed may include any solvent<br>
compatible with the catalyst system and may include pure<br>
alcohols, or mixtures of the alcohol feedstock and/or the desired<br>
carboxylic acid and/or esters of these two compounds. The<br>
preferred solvent and liquid reaction medium for the low water<br>
carbonylation process comprises the carboxylic acid product.<br>
Thus, in the car bony 1 at i on of methanol to acetic acid, the<br>
preferred solvent is acetic acid.<br>
Water is contained in the reaction medium but at concentrations<br>
well below that which has heretofore been thought practical<br>
for achieving sufficient reaction rates. It has previously been<br>
taught that in rhodium catalyzed car bony 1 at ion reactions of<br>
the type set forth in this invention, the addition of water<br>
exerts a beneficial effect upon the reaction rate (US Patent<br>
No.3,769,329) . Thus most commercial operations run at water<br>
concentrations of at least about 14 wt%. Accordingly, it is<br>
quite unexpected that reaction rates substantially equal to<br>
and above reaction rates obtained with such high levels of water<br>
concentration can be achieved with water concentrations below<br>
14 wt% and as low as about 0.1 wt%.<br>
In accordance with the carbony 1 ation process most useful to<br>
manufacture acetic acid according to the present invention,<br>
the desired reaction rates are obtained even at low water<br>
concentrations by including in the reaction medium methyl acetate<br>
and an additional iodide ion which is over and above the iodide<br>
which is present as a catalyst promoter such as methyl iodide<br>
or other organic iodide. The additional iodide promoter is an<br>
iodide salt, with lithium iodide being preferred. It has been<br>
found that under low water concentrations, methyl acetate and<br>
lithium iodide act as rate promoters only when relatively high<br>
concentrations of each of these components are present and that<br>
the promotion is higher when both of these components are present<br>
simultaneously (US Pat.5,001,259) . The concentration of lithium<br>
iodide used in the reaction medium of the preferred carbonyla-<br>
tion reaction system is believed to be quite high as compared<br>
with what little prior art there is dealing with the use of<br>
halide salts in reaction systems of this sort. The absolute<br>
concentration of iodide ion content is not a limitation on the<br>
usefulness of the present invention.<br>
The carbonylation reaction of methanol to acetic acid product<br>
may be carried out by contacting the methanol feed, which is<br>
in the liquid phase, with gaseous carbon monoxide bubbled through<br>
a liquid acetic acid solvent reaction medium containing the<br>
rhodium catalyst, methyl iodide promoter, methyl acetate, and<br>
additional soluble iodide salt, at conditions of temperature<br>
and pressure suitable to form the carbonylation product. It<br>
will be generally recognized that it is the concentration of<br>
iodide ion in the catalyst system that is important and not<br>
the cation associated with the iodide, and that at a given molar<br>
concentration of iodide the nature of the cation is not as<br>
significant as the effect of the iodide concentration. Any metal<br>
iodide salt, or any iodide salt of any organic cation, or<br>
quaternary cation such as quaternary amine or phosphine or<br>
inorganic cation can be used provided that the salt is<br>
sufficiently soluble in the reaction medium to provide the<br>
desired level of the iodide. When the iodide is added as a metal<br>
salt, preferable it is an iodide salt of a member of the group<br>
consisting of the metals of Group IA and Group IIA of the<br>
periodic table as set forth in the "Handbook of Chemistry and<br>
Physics" published by CRC Press, Cleveland, Ohio, 1975-76 (56th<br>
edition). In particular, alkali metal iodides are useful, with<br>
lithium iodide being preferred. In the low water carbonylation<br>
process most useful in this invention, the additional iodide<br>
over and above the organic iodide promoter is present in the<br>
catalyst solution in amounts of from about 2 to about 20 wt%,<br>
the methyl acetate is present in amounts of from about 0.5 to<br>
about 30 wt%, and the lithium iodide is present in amounts of<br>
from about 5 to about 20 wt%. The rhodium catalyst is present<br>
in amounts of from about 200 to about 2000 parts per million<br>
(ppm) .<br>
Typical reaction temperatures for carbonylation will be<br>
approximately 150 to about 250°C, with the temperature range<br>
of about 180 to about 220°C being the preferred range. The carbon<br>
mo noxide partial pressure in the reactor can vary widely but<br>
is typically about 2 to about 30 atmospheres, and preferably,<br>
about 3 to about 10 atmospheres. Because of the partial pressure<br>
of by-products and the vapor pressure of the contained liquids,<br>
the total reactor pressure will range from about 15 to about<br>
40 atmospheres .<br>
A typical reaction and acetic acid recovery system which is<br>
used for the iodide-promo ted rhodium catalyzed carbonylation<br>
of methanol to acetic acid is shown in Figure 1 and comprises<br>
a liquid phase carbonylation reactor, flasher, and a methyl<br>
iodide acetic acid light ends column 14 which has an acetic<br>
acid side stream 17 which proceeds to further purification.<br>
The reactor and flasher are not shown in Figure 1. These are<br>
considered standard equipment now well known in the carbonylation<br>
process art. The carbonylation reactor is typically a stirred<br>
vessel within which the reacting liquid contents are maintained<br>
automatically at a constant level. Into this reactor there are<br>
continuously introduced fresh me thanol, carbon monoxide,<br>
sufficient water as needed to maintain at least a finite<br>
concentration of water in the reaction medium, recycled catalyst<br>
solution from the flasher base, a recycled methyl iodide and<br>
methyl acetate phase, and a recycled aqueous acetic acid phase<br>
from an overhead receiver decanter of the methyl iodide acetic<br>
acid light ends or splitter column 14. Distillation systems<br>
are employed that provide means for recovering the crude acetic<br>
acid and recycling catalyst solution, methyl iodide, and methyl<br>
acetate to the reactor. In a preferred process, carbon monoxide<br>
is continuously introduced into the carbonylation reactor just<br>
below the agitator, which is used to stir the contents. The<br>
gaseous feed is thoroughly dispersed through the reacting liquid<br>
by this stirring me ans. A gaseous purge stre am is vented from<br>
the reactor to prevent buildup of gaseous by-products and to<br>
maintain a set carbon monoxide partial pressure at a given total<br>
reactor pressure. The temperature of the reactor is controlled<br>
and the carbon monoxide feed is introduced at a rate sufficient<br>
t o ma intain the desired total reactor pressure.<br>
Liquid product is drawn off from the carbonylation reactor at<br>
a rate sufficient to ma intain a constant level therein and is<br>
introduced to the flasher. In the flasher the catalyst solution<br>
is withdrawn as a base stream (predominantly acetic acid<br>
containing the rhodium and the iodide salt along with lesser<br>
quantities of methyl acetate, methyl iodide, and water), while<br>
the vapor overhead stream of the flasher comprises largely the<br>
product acetic acid along with methyl iodide, methyl acetate,<br>
and water. Dissolved gases exiting the reactor as a side stream<br>
and entering the flasher consist of a portion of the carbon<br>
monoxide along with gaseous by products such as methane,<br>
hydrogen, and carbon dioxide and exit the flasher as an overhead<br>
stream and are directed to the light ends or splitter column<br>
14 as stream 26.<br>
It has now been discovered that there is a higher concentration,<br>
about 3 times, of the PRC's and in particular acetaldehyde<br>
content in the light phase than in the heavy phase stream-exiting<br>
column 14. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, stream<br>
28, comprising PRC's is directed to an overhead receiver decanter<br>
16 where the light ends phase, stream 30, is directed to<br>
distillation column 18.<br>
The present invention may broadly be considered as distilling<br>
PRC's, primarily aldehydes and alkyl iodides, from a vapor phase<br>
acetic acid stream. The vapor phase stream is twice distilled<br>
and optionally post extracted to remove PRC's. Disclosed is<br>
a method of removing aldehydes and alkyl iodides and reducing<br>
levels of propionic acid, from a first vapor phase acetic acid<br>
stream comprising:<br>
a) condensing said first vapor phase acetic acid stre am i n a<br>
first condenser and biphasically separating it to form a first<br>
heavy liquid phase product and a first light liquid phase product<br>
wherein said first heavy liquid phase contains the larger<br>
proportion of catalytic c omp onents than said first light liquid<br>
phase product;<br>
b) distilling said light liquid phase product in a first<br>
distillation column, which distillation is operative to form<br>
a second vapor phase acetic acid product stream which is enriched<br>
with aldehydes and alkyl iodides with respect to said first<br>
vapor phase acetic acid stream;<br>
c) condensing said second vapor phase stream in a second<br>
condenser and biphasically separating it to form a second heavy<br>
liquid phase product and a second light liquid phase product<br>
wherein said second heavy liquid phase product contains a higher<br>
proportion of catalytic components than said second light liquid<br>
phase product; and<br>
d) distilling said second light liquid phase product in a second<br>
distillation column wherein said process is operative to reduce<br>
and/or remove at least 50% of the alkyl iodide and aldehyde<br>
impurities and at least 20% of the propionic acid impurites<br>
in said first vapor phase acetic acid stream in an aldehyde<br>
and alkyl iodide waste stream.<br>
Referring to figure 1, the first vapor phase acetic acid stream<br>
(28) comprises methyl iodide, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde and<br>
other carbonyl components. This stream is then condensed and<br>
separated (in vessel 16) to form a first vapor phase stream<br>
to separate the heavy phase product containing the larger<br>
proportion of catalytic components-which is recirculated to<br>
the reactor (not shown in figure 1), and a light phase (30)<br>
comprising acetaldehyde, water, and acetic acid. This light<br>
phase is subsequently distilled twice to remove the PRC's and<br>
primarily the acetaldehyde component of the stream. The light<br>
phase (30) is directed to column 18, which serves to form a<br>
second vapor phase (36) enriched in aldehydes and alkyl iodides<br>
with respect to stre am 28. S t e am 36 is condensed (vessel 20)<br>
and biphasically separated to form a second heavy liquid phase<br>
product and a second light phase liquid product. This second<br>
heavy liquid phase contains a higher proportion of catalytic<br>
components than the second light liquid phase and is subsequently<br>
recirculated to the reactor. The second liquid light phase (40)<br>
comprising acetaldehyde, methyl iodide, methanol, and methyl<br>
acetate is directed to a second distillation column (22) wherein<br>
the acetaldehyde is separated from the other components.<br>
Catalytic components include methyl iodide, methyl acetate,<br>
methanol, and water. This inventive process has been found to<br>
reduce and/or remove at least 50% of the alkyl iodide impurities<br>
found in an acetic acid stream. It has also been shown that<br>
acetaldehyde and its derivatives is reduced and/or removed by<br>
at least 50%, most often greater than 60%.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown in<br>
Figure 1; from the top of the light ends or splitter column,<br>
14, vapors are removed via stream 28, condensed, and directed<br>
to 16. The vapors are chilled to a temperature sufficient to<br>
condense and separate the condensable methyl iodide, methyl<br>
acetate, acetaldehyde and other carbonyl components, and water<br>
into two phases. The light phase is directed to distillation<br>
column 18. Column 18 serves to concentrate the acetaldehyde<br>
in stream 32. A portion of stream 30, as stream 34 is directed<br>
back to the light ends column, 14, as reflux. A portion of stream<br>
28 comprises noncondensable gases such as carbon dioxide,<br>
hydrogen, and the like and can be vented as shown in stream<br>
29 on Figure 1. Not illustrated in Figure 1, leaving overhead<br>
receiver decanter 16 is also the heavy phase of stream 28.<br>
Ordinarily this heavy phase is recirculated to the reactor.<br>
However, in another aspect of the invention, a slip stream,<br>
generally a small amount, e.g., 25 vol. %, preferably less than<br>
about 20 vol. % of the heavy phase is directed to a carbonyl<br>
treatment process of this invention and the remainder recycled<br>
to the reactor or reaction system. This slip stream of the heavy<br>
phase ma y be treated individually, or combined with the light<br>
phase, stre am 30 for further distillation and extraction of<br>
carbonyl impurities.<br>
Stream 30 enters column 18 as stream 22 in about the middle<br>
of the column. Column 18 serves to concentrate the aldehyde<br>
components of stream 32 by separating water and acetic acid<br>
from the lighter components. In a preferred process of the<br>
present invention, stream 32 is distilled in 18, where 18<br>
contains appromimately 40 trays, and temperature ranges therein<br>
from about 283°F (139.4°C) at the bottom to about 191°F (88.3°C)<br>
at the top of the column. Exiting the top of 18 is stream 36<br>
comprising PRC's and in particular acetaldehyde, methyl iodide,<br>
methyl acetate, and methanol, and alkyl iodides. Exiting the<br>
bottom of 18 is stream 38 comprising approximately 70% water<br>
and 30% acetic acid. Stream 38 is processed, generally cooled<br>
utilizing a heat exchanger, is recycled to the light ends column<br>
overhead decanter 16 and ultimately to the reactor or reaction<br>
system. Stream 36 has been found to have approximately seven<br>
times more aldehyde content after the recycle through decanter<br>
16. It has been found that recycling a portion of stream 38<br>
identified as stream 46 back through 16 increases efficiency<br>
of the inventive process and allows for more acetaldehyde to<br>
be present in the light phase, stream 32. Stream 36 is then<br>
directed to an overhead receiver 20 after it has been chilled<br>
to condense any condensable gases present.<br>
Exiting 20 is stream 40 comprising acetaldehyde, methyl iodide,<br>
methyl acetate, and methanol. A portion of stream 40, i.e.,<br>
side stream 42 is returned to 18 as reflux. Stream 40 enters<br>
distillation column 22 at about the bottom of the column. Column<br>
22 serves to separate the majority of acetaldehyde from the<br>
methyl iodide, methyl acetate, and methanol in the stream 40.<br>
In an embodiment, column 22 contains about 100 trays and is<br>
operated at a temperature ranging from about 224°F (106.6°C)<br>
at the bottom to about 175°F (79.4°C) at the top. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, 22 contain structured packing, in place of trays.<br>
Preferred packing is a structured packing with an interfacial<br>
area of about 65 ft2 /ft3 , preferably made from a metallic alloy<br>
like 2205 or other like packing material, provided they are<br>
compatible with the compositions. It was observed during<br>
experimentation that uniform column loading, required for good<br>
separation, were better with structured packing than with trays.<br>
Alternatively, ceramic packing may be employed. The residue<br>
of 22, stream 44, exits at the bottom of the tower and is<br>
recycled to the carbonylation process.<br>
Acetaldehyde polymerizes in the presence of methyl iodide to<br>
form metaldehyde and paraldehyde. These polymers generally are<br>
low molecular weight, less than about 200. Paraldehyde has been<br>
found to be relatively soluble in the reaction liquid, and<br>
primarily in acetic acid. Metaldehyde, upon its precipitation,<br>
is a sand-like, granule polymer than is not soluble in the<br>
reaction liquid beyond about 3 wt% concentration. Although these<br>
polymers are a nuisance for the reaction system, they generally<br>
do not require great efforts to remove from the tower once<br>
formed.<br>
It has been discovered that during the reaction, and with the<br>
heating of column 22, higher molecular weight polymers of<br>
acetaldehyde, molecular weight greater than about 1000, form.<br>
These higher molecular weight polymers are believe to come as<br>
results of processing the light phase. No literature has been<br>
found of formation of these polymers when processing the heavy<br>
phase. There has been no indication that these higher molecular<br>
weight polymers form when processing the heavy phase. This is<br>
a unique problem to processing of the light phase. The higher<br>
molecular weight polymers are viscous and thixotropic or do<br>
not obey Newtonian fluid laws. As heat is applied to the system,<br>
they tend to harden and adhere to the walls of the tower where<br>
their removal is cumbersome. Once polymerized they are only<br>
slightly soluble in organic or aqueous solvents and removal<br>
from the system requires mechanical means. Thus an inhibitor<br>
is needed, preferably in tower 22, to reduce the formation of<br>
these impurities, i.e., metaldehyde and paraldehyde and higher<br>
molecular weight polymers of acetaldehyde (AcH). Inhibitors<br>
generally consist of C1-10 alkanol, preferably methanol, water,<br>
acetic acid and the like used individually or in combination<br>
with each other or with one or more other inhibitors. Stream<br>
46, which is a portion of column 18 residue and a slip stream<br>
of stream 38, comprises water and acetic acid and hence can<br>
serve as an inhibitor. Stream 46 as shown in Figure 1 splits<br>
to form streams 48 and 50. Stream 50 is added to column 22 to<br>
inhibit formation of metaldehyde and paraldehyde impurities<br>
and higher molecular weight polymers. Since the residue of 22<br>
is recycled to the reactor, any inhibitors added must be<br>
compatible with the reaction chemistry. It has been found that<br>
small amounts of water, methanol, acetic acid, or a combination<br>
thereof, do not interfere with the reaction chemistry and<br>
practically eliminate the formation of polymers of acetaldehyde.<br>
Stream 50 is also preferably employed as an inhibitor since<br>
this ma terial does not change the reactor wa ter balance. Wa t e r<br>
as an inhibitor is the least preferred solvent of inhibition<br>
since large quantities are generally needed to be an effective<br>
inhibitor and as such it tends to extract a large amount of<br>
acetaldehyde, reducing the purity of stream 52 exiting column<br>
22.<br>
Exiting the top of 22 is stream 52 comprising PRC's. Stream<br>
52 is directed to a condenser and then to overhead receiver<br>
24. After condensation, any non-condensable materials are vented<br>
from receiver 24. Exiting 24 is stream 54. Stream 56, a slip<br>
stream of stream 54, is used as reflux for 22. Exiting the bottom<br>
of 22 is stre am 44 comprising methyl iodide, methanol, methyl<br>
acetate, methanol and water. This stream is combined with stream<br>
66 and directed to the reactor.<br>
It is important for the extraction mechanism that the top stream<br>
of 22 remain cold, generally at a temperature of about 13°C.<br>
This stream may be obtained or maintained at about 13°C by<br>
conventional techniques known to those of skill in the art,<br>
or any mechanism generally accepted by the industry.<br>
In a preferred embodime nt of the present invention, upon exiting<br>
2 4, stream 54/58 is sent through a condenser/chiller (now stream<br>
62) and then to the extractor 27 to remove and recycle small<br>
amounts of methyl iodide from the aqueous PRC stream. Non-<br>
condensable gases are vented from the top of 24. In extractor<br>
27, PRC's and alkyl iodides are extracted with water, preferably<br>
water from an internal stream so as to maintain water balance<br>
within the reaction system. As a result of this extraction,<br>
methyl iodide separates from the aqueous PRC's and alkyl iodide<br>
phase. In a preferred embodiment, a mi xer - setter with a water-<br>
to-feed ratio of about 2 is employed.<br>
Exiting the extractor is stream 66 comprising methyl iodide,<br>
which is recycled to the reaction system and ultimately to the<br>
reactor. The aqueous stream of 64, leaves the extractor from<br>
the top thereof. This PRC-rich, and in particular, acetaldehyde-<br>
rich aqueous phase is directed to waste treatment.<br>
The PRC (52) and alkyl iodide-rich phase (44) of the stream<br>
stripped from the light phase may optionally be directed to<br>
an extractor (27) to remove organic iodide compounds therefrom.<br>
The present inventive process has been found to isolate methyl<br>
iodide from acetaldehyde for recycling back to the reaction<br>
system. Additionally, alkyl iodides such as hexyl iodide have<br>
been reduced in the final acetic acid process significantly<br>
via the dual distillation process disclosed herein. Hexyl iodide<br>
has been reduced by a percent reduction of about 50%, usually<br>
greater than 70%. Furthermore, impurities such as crotonaldehyde,<br>
2-ethyl crotonaldehyde were found to be significantly reduced<br>
or removed completely from the process. Crotonaldehyde and ethyl<br>
crotonaldehyde have been found reduced and/or removed by at<br>
least 50%, most often greater than 75% and sometimes 100%.<br>
Propionic acid concentration has been found reduced and/or<br>
removed by a percent reduction of at least 20%, usually greater<br>
than about 30 or 40% when compared to the initial stream removed<br>
from vessel 14 (without processing). Total iodides were found<br>
reduced by a percent reduction of at least 50%, usually greater<br>
than about 60%.<br>
The permanganate time found for the acetic acid product stream<br>
once processed through the disclosed method increased about<br>
8-fold, or from about 50%, to greater than 7 5% or 85% from that<br>
product stream not processed as herein described. Data indicates<br>
a 50 and 35 second time to increase to about 6 and 5 minutes<br>
respectively.<br>
Although the present invention has been generally described<br>
above utilizing the light ends phase of column 14, any stream<br>
in the carbonyltion process having a high concentration of<br>
PRC's and alkyl iodides may be treated in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Illustrative alternate embodiments of the present invention,<br>
not shown in Figure 1 include but are not limited to the<br>
following:<br>
a) directing an overhead stream from vessel 16 comprising light<br>
phase organic material to column 18 and proceeding as described<br>
above;<br>
b) directing a residue stream comprising heavy phase organic<br>
material from vessel 16 to column 18 and proceeding as described<br>
above;<br>
c) directing a steam, preferably a residue stream, from a light<br>
ends receiver vent decanter using stream 29, and proceeding<br>
as described above;<br>
d) directing a stream from the light ends vent stripper column<br>
and proceeding as described above;<br>
e) any combination of the above streams (a-d) which comprise<br>
a high concentration of PRC's, propionic acid and alkyl iodide<br>
impurities .<br>
Optimization of the inventive process when employing alternate<br>
streams may require modification of equipment to achieve maximum<br>
efficiency of PRC's and alkyl iodide removal from the carbonyla-<br>
tion process. For example, if the same equipment is employed<br>
for alternate streams, as for the preferred stream described<br>
(i.e. use of stream 28), a taller distillation column 18 may<br>
be required to achieve maximum efficiency of removal. If one<br>
employs a stream comprising heavy phase components in the<br>
inventive process, removal of acetaldehyde may not be as<br>
efficient compared to removal of acetaldehyde strictly from<br>
a light phase stream.<br>
As previously mentioned, it has been found that when shutting<br>
down the carbonylation system, in particular the distillation<br>
columns employed in the present process, polymers of<br>
acetaldehyde, both low and high molecular weight chain polymers,<br>
tend to form and build up in the base of the second column.<br>
This is due to the reaction of acetaldehyde and HI present in<br>
the column and has been seen to react when the temperature is<br>
about 102°C. A constant flow of solvent to maintain contact<br>
between the stream within the second distillation column and<br>
a solvent from an internal stream (such as one that contains<br>
a large percentage of acetic acid or methyl acetate) results<br>
in a polymer-free column base during shut down of the column<br>
or the PRC/alkyl iodide removal process.<br>
Preferred solvents include those from internal streams containing<br>
primarily acetic acid, methyl acetate, methanol, water, methyl<br>
acetate, methyl iodide, or combinations thereof. To maintain<br>
internal balance within the system, it is preferred to utilize<br>
an internal stream, however solvent from an external source<br>
may be employed. Since acetic acid is high boiling, it helps<br>
strip the acetaldehyde overhead. However, any non-reactant<br>
solvent with a normal boiling point greater than or equal to<br>
the boiling point of methyl iodide is acceptable. This solvent<br>
could be recovered by sending the residue to a recovery device<br>
(e.g.,stripper, decanter, or permeable membrane).<br>
Overall benefits observed to the final product utilizing the<br>
above described process include:<br>
1. increased permanganate time test values.<br>
2. lower concentration of PRC's;<br>
3. lower total iodides; and,<br>
4. lower propionic acid.<br>
The following Table 1 illustrates data for various PRC's and<br>
permanganate time before and after the inventive process was<br>
employed. The data was obtained from a crude reactor product<br>
stream, and a crude acetic acid product residue stream once<br>
the reactor was operating at steady state conditions.<br>

24. A method of removing aldehydes and alkyl iodides from a first<br>
vapor phase splitter acetic acid stream comprising:<br>
a) condensing said first vapor phase acetic acid stream in a<br>
first condensor and biphasically separating it to form a<br>
first heavy liquid phase product and a first light liquid<br>
phase product wherein said first heavy liquid phase<br>
contains the larger proportion of catalytic components<br>
than said first light liquid phase product;<br>
b) distilling said first light liquid phase product in a first<br>
distillation column, which distillation is operative to<br>
form a second vapor phase acetic acid product stream<br>
which is enriched with aldehydes and alkyl iodides with<br>
respect to said first vapor phase acetic acid stream;<br>
c) condensing said second vapor phase stream in a second<br>
eondensor and biphasically separating it to form a<br>
second heavy liquid phase product and a second light<br>
liquid phase product wherein said second heavy liquid<br>
phase product contains a higher proportion of catalytic<br>
components than said second light liquid phase product;<br>
and<br>
d) distilling said second light liquid phase product in a<br>
second distillation column wherein said process is<br>
operative to remove at least 50% of the alkyl iodide and<br>
aldehyde impurities and at least 20% of the propionic<br>
acid impurities in said first vapor phase acetic acid<br>
stream in an aldehyde and alkyl iodide waste stream.<br><br>
Disclosed is a method to manufacture high purity acetic acid.<br>
Although described in relation to that produced by a low water<br>
carbonylation process the present invention is applicable to<br>
other mechanisms for production of acetic acid which results<br>
in formation of permanganate reducing compounds such as acetaldehyde<br>
 and its derivatives, and alkyl iodide impurities in intermediate<br>
 process streams. It has been found that permanganate<br>
reducing compounds and alkyl iodides may be conveniently removed<br>
from a light phase of an intermediate stream in the reaction<br>
process by employing a multiple distillation process coupled<br>
with an optional post extraction of acetaldehyde. The<br>
distillation process involves first distilling a light phase<br>
to concentrate the permanganate reducing compounds, and in<br>
particular the acetaldehyde, and then separating the permanganate<br>
reducing compounds and alkyl iodides in a second distillation<br>
tower. The second distillation serves to remove the permanganate<br>
reducing compounds and alkyl iodides from methyl iodide, methyl<br>
acetate, and methanol mixture. As an optional third step, the<br>
twice distilled stream may be directed to an extractor to recover<br>
any remaining quantities of methyl iodide from the aqueous<br>
acetaldehyde waste stream. This process affords a final product<br>
in greater than 99% purity.<br>
It has been found that this process reduces and/or removes at<br>
least 50% of the permanganate reducing compounds and alkyl<br>
iodides and at least 20% of the propionic acid impurity from<br>
the intermediate light phase stream, and results in lower alkyl<br>
iodide concentration in the carbonylation reaction process,<br>
and in particular in the carbonylation reactor.<br>
It has also been found that during shut down of the inventive<br>
process, higher molecular weight polymers of acetaldehyde tend<br>
to form in the base of the second distillation tower. To avoid<br>
or minimize the formation of these polymers, a constant flow<br>
of solvent is passed through the base of the column.<br></td>
