The invention relates to a drafting arrangement for spinning machines, especially ring spinning machines according to the preamble of claim 1. A bottom roller arrangement is to be understood as being either a single continuous bottom roller or a plurality of axially, mutually aligned bottom rollers.<br>
Usually, the bottom rollers of the drafting arrangement of a ring spinning machine are driven by gears or motors connected to at least one end. This means that it is necessary to provide space for housing gears and motors at the ends of the bottom rollers, which leads to a respective extension of the already long spinning machine (see DE-OS 199 45 797 for example). Moreover, the arrangement of gears and motors at the face ends of the bottom rollers is also linked to considerable mounting efforts.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a further drafting arrangement of the aforementioned kind in which especially the drives for the bottom roller arrangements can be housed in a more compact manner and can be mounted with less efforts whilst maintaining a perfect drive of the bottom rollers, especially by taking the torsional problems into account.<br>
In accordance with the invention, several drives of the bottom roller arrangements are shifted inwardly from their face sides, so that no extension of the spinning machine in the longitudinal direction is required to house the drives. A kind of an underfloor drive is thus obtained<br><br>
The torsion of the bottom rollers can be reduced particularly effectively by providing a suitable number of drives over the length of the bottom rollers in an optimally distributed manner.<br>
Although the subdivision of bottom rollers into two separately held partial rollers is already known, the two partial rollers are driven from one face side according to the state of the art.<br>
The drive motors are preferably arranged implement the method in accordance with the invention namely in order to implement the method in accordance with the invention.<br>
The invention is now explained as an example below by reference to the enclosed drawing, wherein:<br>

Fig. 9	shows a merely schematic front view of a ring spinning machine with a<br>
preferred embodiment of a drafting arrangement in accordance with the invention.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a cross-sectional view through a three-roller drafting arrangement with an input roller 11, a middle roller 12 equipped with aprons 20 and an output roller 13. The bottom rollers 11, 12, 13 extending at least over a major part of the length of a ring spinning machine are associated in a manner distributed over their length with pressure rollers 11', 12' and 13' at each spinning place, with the pressure rollers 12' being equipped with aprons 20' associated with the aprons 20.<br>
A sliver 21 is introduced in the known manner between the pairs of cylinders/rollers 11, 11'; 12,12'; 13, 13', which sliver is slightly pre-drawn in a pre-drafting zone 22 and is then finally drawn in a main drafting zone 23 in order to be supplied to a spinning<br><br>
apparatus (not shown) by the nip gap of the pair of rollers/cylinders 13, 13" as a twisted yarn 21', which optionally occurs through a condensing zone.<br>
The input and output rollers 11, 13 are provided according to figs. 1 to 4 and 7, 8 in certain intervals with flutings 24 on which the pressure rollers 11', 13' (fig. 5) rest and thus ensure a secure transmission of axial force onto the sliver 21.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the bottom rollers 11,13, as also the middle roller 12 which is not shown in fig. 1, are rotationally held at the two ends in bearings 14,15 provided in the machine head 25 or machine base 26. The drive is performed at a clear distance from the bearings 14,15 at at least two drive locations 16,16' of the bottom rollers 11, 12,13, of which only one (16) is shown in closer detail in the figs. 1 to 4, whereas the other (16') is only indicated with the broken line. In the embodiment according to fig. 1, a toothed wheel 27 is shown concentrically in the middle of the bottom rollers 11,12, 13, which toothed wheel is disposed in a torsionally rigid manner on the bottom cylinder 11,12,13 and can be driven to a rotational movement via a pinion gear 28 and a motor 18 which drives the same. The pinion gear 28 and the toothed wheel 27 form a transmission gear 17. A further similar drive arrangement 17, 18 is arranged at 16'. As a result of this arrangement, two drive locations 16, 16' are disposed on the respective bottom cylinder 11,12,13 at a clear distance from the end bearings 14,15, which drive locations are preferably evenly distributed over the length of the bottom cylinder. The bottom cylinders are subdivided by the drive locations 16, 16' preferably into three parts of equal length.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 2, worm threads 29 are disposed at the drive locations 16,16', which threads can be driven to a rotational movement by an endless screw 30 driven by a motor 18. The worm thread 29 and the endless screw 30 form a step-down gear 17'.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 3, linear motors 18' with a drive wheel 31 are disposed at the drive locations 16,16'.<br><br>
According to fig. 4, a belt 32 can also be used as a gear 17" between a motor 18 and the bottom roller 11,12,13, which belt is placed over a drive whorl 33 of motor 18 and between two flutings 24 in the zone of the drive locations 16, 16' about the bottom roller 11,12,13.<br>
According to fig. 5, a separate drive belt 32 can be provided for each bottom roller 11, 12,13 which is wrapped around a pulley 33'. The drive of the pulley 33' can be provided via gears 17*" which is only indicated in broken lines by a single drive motor 18. Preferably, the bottom cylinders 12,13 are driven by different drive motors 18, whereas only a single electric drive motor 18 is provided for the bottom cylinders 11, 12 and the slightly different speed of the bottom rollers 11, 12 is ensured by a suitable gear 17'".<br>
Fig. 6 shows the entire ring spinning machine 34 in the broken line, with conventional drafting arrangements 36 being disposed on each side of the vertical central longitudinal plane 35. The output rollers 13 of the left drafting arrangement 36 are driven to a rotational movement which is indicated by an arrow by a schematically shown central drive motor 18 via a chain drive 37. The output roller 13 of the drafting arrangement 36' which is on the right side in fig. 6 is driven to a rotational movement which is indicated by an arrow via an intermediate wheel 39 driven by the same drive motor 18 in the opposite direction and a further chain drive 37'. The drive of the input roller 11 and the middle roller 12 can be performed by gears 17"' which are only indicated by the broken line and are connected to the output roller 13 of the motor 18. The motor 18 and a gear which is optionally connected thereto downstream as well as the intermediate wheel 39 rest on a base 38.<br>
Preferably, the middle roller 12 is not driven to a suitable rotational movement by gear 17'", but by a separate drive motor via a chain drive, in analogy to the chain drives 37, 37'. The drive of input roller 11 and the middle roller 12 is preferably combined, with the middle roller being driven appropriately analogously to the output rollers according to fig. 6 and the rotational movement on input roller 11 being produced by suitable gears. Principally, individual drive motors can also be provided for each of the bottom rollers<br><br>
11,12,13. If separate drive motors 18,18' are provided for the same bottom rollers 11, 12 and 13 on both sides of the spinning machine 34, they must be arranged staggered according to fig. 9 in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine 34. In fig. 9, it is necessary to imagine a similar bottom roller on the other machine side behind the visible bottom rollers, namely the middle roller 12 and the output roller 13. The drive motors 13 drive the bottom rollers 12,13 on the one machine side via the drive connections shown with the broken lines, and the drive motors 18' drive the bottom cylinders 12 and 13 on the other machine side.<br>
According to fig. 7, three drive locations 16 are provided evenly distributed over the length of a bottom roller 11,12,13, which drive locations are arranged according to the embodiment according to fig. 1.<br>
According to fig. 8, the bottom roller arrangements 11,12, 13 can each consist of two axially mutually aligned bottom roller parts 11'", 12m, 13"' or 11'", 12m, 13"' which are rotationally held in pivot bearings 14' and 15' at the end zones which are mutually opposite at 19. In this case, one or several drive locations 16", 16'" are disposed between the end pivot bearings 14,15' or 14', 15 of the bottom roller parts 11", 12", 13" or 1 r, 12"', 13'". The bottom roller parts 11", 12", 13" or 11"', 12'", 13'" are preferably of the same length.<br>
The motors 18 should appropriately be synchronous motors. If in accordance with fig. 7 several synchronous motors act upon a single bottom cylinder 11,12, 13 or a single bottom cylinder part 11", 12", 13" or 11"', 12"', 13'", the synchronous motors 18 should be capable of being brought to a certain angular position by applying a suitable direct voltage. During the production all synchronous motors are angularly aligned at first with one another by applying the respective direct voltage; the positive-locking coupling of the synchronous motors 18 with the associated bottom rollers 11,12 or 13 is produced thereafter.<br><br>
The drafting arrangement drive in accordance with the invention can also be designated as a kind of underfloor drive, because no space can be made available for the drive at the face ends of the bottom roller arrangements. Moreover, the efforts involving the motors and gears are reduced considerably.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the electromotive drives are positioned below the drafting rollers. As a result, the gearbox at the end of the machine can be omitted and the maximum length of the spinning machine is correspondingly reduced to the length of the drafting roller length. The length of the strand of cylinders can be doubled as compared with currently possible maximum of twelve sections.<br><br>
