DE4134018 describes a composting system for organic waste material and contaminated soils which has a crane-mounted mixing head in form of grab and/or mixing rollers which move over composting material and provide continuous mixing. It incorporates a means for dosing the material with substances which promote the composting process, such #as nutrients, enzymes or hydrogen peroxide. Under this system the process space can be as large as may be required, and the material is turned on a continuous basis so that lumps are broken up and the access of oxygen to the material is increased. The composting process is thereby greatly accelerated. However, the system is very huge and not suitable unless operated on large open space.<br>
Device for changing food by-product to liquid manure by using microorganisms has been disclosed in JP6024882.<br>
Combination of enzyme-fermentation and anaerobic bacterial fermentation for food waste has been described in JP8323328.<br>

Fig. 3 is the top view of the machine showing container with door assembly (14) and chopper assemblies. Fig. 4 is the front view of the system showing the container (9), plough type blades (11), discharge assembly (13), shaft (10), seal bush (12), control panel (20), base frame (19), motor (1, 2), gear box (3), chain coupling (4), bearing (5), adapter sleeve (6), plumer block (7), and locking ring (8).<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
Apparatus:<br>
The system includes a container (9) which may be of cylindrical shape, incorporating a shaft (10) at the axis, affixed on which are plough type blades (11) moving in a circular fashion across the periphery of the<br>
8<br><br>
container. The shaft is supported on a bearing (5) outside the container and it is driven by gear box (3) connected to a motor by a pulley (17,18) 8B belt (16) drive. The organic waste is fed through a door assembly (14) at the top side of the container.<br>
To the cylindrical container, a chopper assembly (15) along with an electric motor drive is attached in an angular position at the back side of the machine. The chopper assembly consists of two or more blades to facilitate chopping of organic waste into smaller particles.<br>
There is a discharge assembly (13) at the bottom side of the container. The discharge assembly has a closing shutter door which is operated by a lever. After processing as described in part I, the material is transferred into a movable trolley.<br>
Provision is also made of a control panel (20) which provides a timer,<br>
temperature control, emergency stop-switch and a current indicator<br>
(ammeter).<br>
Complete assembly is covered by a stainless steel or mild steel metal<br>
case (19).<br>
The process:<br>
Part-I<br>
The bio-degradable waste such as kitchen waste is collected in a container. The said container is mounted on a trolley and it can be easily shifted to the processing machine for conversion of waste into organic fertilizer or fuel pellets.<br>
9<br><br>
The waste is chopped for 10 - 20 min to make small pieces of the material. Time required for chopping depends on the nature of the material. Smaller particles generally have better reactivity and they get converted into desired material at comparatively faster rate than larger lumps.        v<br>
After chopping the material, microbial culture and saw dust are added to it.<br>
The culture contains active microorganisms which help in converting the waste into organic fertilizer. These microorganisms facilitate desirable bio-reaction and prevent the growth of pathogenic microbes. The process also prevents formation of substances and gases with foul odor.<br>
Saw dust absorbs excess moisture and makes the material free-flowing. It also facilitates operations like turning and handling. When fuel pellets are made out of waste, saw dust also adds to the fuel value and facilitate burning. The moisture of the material is maintained between 35-45%, preferably 40% during the process.<br>
Optionally, lignite can also be added to the material. It gives soil-like colour to the organic fertilizer.<br>
The machine is then run for about 15 minutes to ensure even mixing of chopped waste with the culture and saw dust. The chopping and mixing process raises the temperature of the bio-mass to about 50°C.<br>
The material is then taken out in a movable trolley. Part-II<br>
10<br><br>
PREPARATION OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER<br>
The material taken out from the machine into the movable trolley at the end of Part-I of the process, is emptied on the ground to make a heap of approximately one meter. Material is turned every 5-6 days to ensure aerobic conditions. Temperature of the material rises up to 70°C within 4-5 days, due to which the pathogenic microorganisms are eliminated.<br>
It is necessary to maintain the moisture of the material to 22-30%, preferably 25%, during maturity.<br>
After 20-22 days, the material is ready for use as an organic fertilizer. It provides organic carbon to the soil, which is necessary for plant health and growth. It also improves moisture retaining capacity of the soil and prevents soil erosion. Thus it serves as soil-conditioner. Moreover, the said organic fertilizer prevents leaching of micro nutrients from the soil.<br>
A fraction of the material obtained at the end of Part-II of the process may be added to fresh waste and the rest of the process may be repeated. The effective quantum of the said fraction of the material thus added can be determined in such a way so as to attain the parameters described hereinabove.<br>
Part-Ill<br>
PREPARATION OF FUEL PELLETS<br>
The material obtained at the end of Part-I of the process was collected in a tray. The material was spread and cut into pieces of convenient size. It was kept for sun-drying for 5-6 days.<br>
11<br><br>
EXAMPLE - 1<br>
Preparation of organic fertilizer:<br>
35 Kg kitchen waste was chopped in the machine for 10 min. 15 Kg saw dust, 0.1 Kg culture and 0.1 Kg lignite were added. The machine was run for 10 min for mixing. It was then taken out in a movable trolley. This process was repeated 10 times i.e., 10 charges were taken and a composite heap of about one meter height was made. The material was turned every 5th day for sufficient aeration. At the end of 20 days, the material was spread on the ground for one day for drying. The weight of the final material was 232 Kg.<br>
EXAMPLE - 2 Preparation of fuel pellets<br>
35 Kg kitchen waste was chopped in the machine for 10 min. 15 Kg saw dust, 0.1 Kg culture and 0.1 Kg lignite were added. The machine was run for 10 min for mixing. It was then taken out in a movable trolley. The material was spread uniformly in the tray, cut into small pieces and was sun-dried to get fuel pellets.<br>
