				<td>Method for Manufacturing a Three-dimensionally<br>
Deformable, Sheet-like Reinforcing Structure<br>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing a three-dimensionally deformable, sheet-<br>
like reinforcing structure from a likewise sheet-like, cellular base material. The base material can<br>
in particular be a foamed plastic which is reinforced with reinforcing structures or also a non-<br>
reinforced foamed plastic. The invention also relates to a reinforcing structure manufactured in<br>
accordance with the method, and to its use for manufacturing a composite material, a<br>
"composite", for which the reinforcing structure serves as a core material.<br>
Cellular reinforcing structures and their use as core materials of composites is known from WO<br>
98/10919 A2. The reinforcing structures are arranged between covering layers of the respective<br>
composite in a sandwich construction, for manufacturing light but nonetheless rigid composites.<br>
The reinforcing structures serve as spacers for the covering layers and increase the bending and<br>
buckling resistance of the composites. In order to be able to fixedly connect the covering layers<br>
of a composite, between which a reinforcing structure is inserted, to each other by means of a<br>
joiner, for example by means of an adhesive or synthetic resin, a honeycombed reinforcing<br>
structure is used comprising hexagonal material cells and thin bridges which connect them to<br>
each other. The joiner penetrates the cavities of the reinforcing structure between the material<br>
cells in the region of the bridges, such that at least in the region of the cavities, a material<br>
connection to the covering layers is guaranteed. The structuring into material cells and<br>
connecting bridges provides the reinforcing structure with a flexibility such as is needed for<br>
manufacturing three-dimensionally deformed composites.<br>
However, producing the cavities or other types of material attenuations to the required precision<br>
and a desirable efficiency is problematic. Precisely incorporating the material .attenuations, for<br>
example by means of milling, laser treatment or water jet treatment, is very time-consuming and<br>
therefore cost-intensive.<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to precisely and efficiently manufacture reinforcing structures of<br>
the type cited.<br>
The subject of the invention is a method for manufacturing a three-dimensionally deformable,<br>
sheet-like reinforcing structure, wherein material attenuations are incorporated or machined or<br>
worked into a sheet-like, cellular base material, distributed over the area of the base material,<br>
said material attenuations sub-dividing the base material into a plurality of material cclLs which<br>
are delineated from each other by the material attenuations but are still connected to each other.<br>
The material cells are formed by the cellular base material. The material attenuations are<br>
preferably incorporated in a regular distribution, such that a correspondingly regular distribution<br>
of the material cells and thus structuring of the reinforcing structures is obtained. The material<br>
cells preferably each exhibit the same shape and size. The same preferably applies to the material<br>
attenuations. The material cells can in particular be polygons, preferably equilateral polygons.<br>
They are preferably hexagonal in a top view onto the reinforcing structure.<br>
When incorporating the material attenuations in a batch operation, the base material can be<br>
provided in the form of board material which can in particular be plate-like or, in more flexible<br>
boards, also mat-like. Flexible base material can also be provided with the material attenuations<br>
as a web product in a continuous method. The base material can exhibit a thickness of a few<br>
millimetres, for example at least 5 mm, and a thickness of up to a few centimetres, preferably at<br>
most 20 mm. The cellular material can have a predominantly open porosity, or more preferably a<br>
closed porosity, in order to prevent water or even moisture from entering.<br>
Foamed plastic materials are preferred base materials, wherein foamed thermoplasts or also<br>
foamed thermosets can in particular be used. Advantageous plastic foam materials are thus for<br>
example polyethylene tcrcphthalatc (PET) foams or polystyrene (PS) foams, as well as more<br>
flexible polyethylene (PE) foams or polypropylene (PP) foams or also, as an example of a<br>
thermosetting material, polyurethane (PUR) foams. The plastic foam material can be reinforced,<br>
i.e. can comprise reinforcing structures embedded in the foam material, or can be used with no<br>
reinforcement. The base material is preferably extruded and simultaneously foamed.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the material attenuations are incorporated into the base<br>
material by means of cutting or sawing. The word "or" is used here, as elsewhere in accordance<br><br>
with the invention, always in its usual logical sense, i.e. it includes the meaning of "either ... or"<br>
and also the meaning of "and", providing the respective context does not rule out any of these<br>
meanings. Accordingly, the material attenuations can be incorporated solely by cutting or solely<br>
by sawing or - as corresponds to preferred method embodiments - by a multi-stage process<br>
which includes cutting and sawing and preferably consists of cutting and sawing.<br>
In a preferred multi-stage incorporating process, the first stage involves cutting in accordance<br>
with the shape of the material attenuations, and after the cutting process, which itself can<br>
comprise one or more stages, sawing in accordance with the shape of the material attenuations.<br>
The material attenuations are sawn out.<br>
Although the material attenuations can be incorporated in the form of recesses, material<br>
attenuations which are shaped as passages, i.e. cavities extending from the upper to the lower<br>
side of the reinforcing structure, are preferred, since material attenuations extending through the<br>
structure are advantageous with regard to three-dimensional dcformability. When manufacturing<br>
a composite, the reinforcing structure can be penetrated in the region of the passages by a free-<br>
flowing joiner, in order to connect the covering layers of the composite to each other through the<br>
reinforcing structure in a material connection.<br>
After the material attenuations have been incorporated, material webs or bridges remain which<br>
connect the material cells to each other. After cutting or sawing - preferably, after the final<br>
cutting or sawing step - these connecting bridges are compressed, thus permanently reducing<br>
their cross-section. The cellular base material is compacted in the region of the bridges. The<br>
bridges advantageously fall short of an upper side and lower side of the reinforcing structure,<br>
such that when the reinforcing structure is embedded between two covering layers, for example<br>
two metallic or plastic covering layers, the bridges do not touch said covering layers.<br>
Compacting the bridges by compression is an inexpensive way of making the bridges short of the<br>
upper and lower side of the reinforcing structure. When the reinforcing structure is inserted<br>
between covering layers of a composite to be manufactured, and the material attenuations arc-<br>
shaped - as is preferred - as passages in the reinforcing structure, the material attenuations form<br>
a channel system between the covering layers which extends continuously over the entire area of<br>
the reinforcing structure and can accordingly be penetrated by the joiner parallel to the sheet-like<br>
reinforcing structure, such that the reinforcing structure is in particular suitable for being filled<br><br>
with joiner by vacuum injection, wherein the joiner can be injected from the side. On the other<br>
hand, however, the composite can also be manufactured by placing the reinforcing structure onto<br>
one of the covering layers, filling the material attenuations with the joiner, and placing the other<br>
of the covering layers onto the reinforcing structure.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the material cells are compacted near the surface and thus rounded on<br>
an upper side or a lower side, along at least a part of their edges formed by incorporating the<br>
material attenuations. On the one hand, rounding counteracts a notching effect caused by sharp<br>
edges, while on the other hand, the area of the material attenuations on the upper side or lower<br>
side of the reinforcing structure is increased, which advantageously increases the area available<br>
to the joiner for the material connection to the covering layers or at least to one of the covering<br>
layers and thus increases the stability of the composite.<br>
The cellular material can be compacted in the region of the bridges or the material cells can be<br>
compacted near the surface at ambient temperature, for example room temperature, or in a<br>
heated state of the cellular material. A heatable or non-heatable bridge presser for compacting<br>
the bridges or a heatable or non-hcatable top presser for compacting near the surface, and as<br>
applicable for compacting only near the edges of the material cells, can be used. If the cellular<br>
material is compacted while warm, it is preferably heated to a temperature just below its melting<br>
point and compacted at this temperature.<br>
A preferred manufacturing method includes at least one separating process, namely cutting or<br>
sawing, and at least one compacting process, namely compacting the cellular material in the<br>
region of the bridges or along the edges of the material cells. In particularly preferred method<br>
embodiments, the material attenuations are incorporated sequentially by cutting and then sawing,<br>
and at least the bridges arc then compacted; more preferably, both cited compacting processes<br>
are performed, for example firstly compacting the bridges and then compacting at least the edges<br>
of the material cells near the surface. A preferred method therefore comprises at least three<br>
stages, more preferably at least four. Proceeding from the cellular base material, the reinforcing<br>
structure is preferably manufactured only by cutting or sawing and additionally at least one of<br>
the two compacting processes.<br><br>
For incorporating the material attenuations, it is advantageous if multiple cutting knives or saw<br>
blades are arranged on a cutting tool or sawing tool, facing an upper side of the base material,<br>
and are moved, for example pushed, into or preferably through the base material by a movement<br>
of the tool towards a lower side of the base material. The term "upper side of the base material"<br>
here is merely intended to indicate the side of the base material facing the cutting knives or saw<br>
blades, and is not intended to state whether the separating tool is arranged vertically above or<br>
below the base material, wherein the base material can also be processed in a vertical orientation,<br>
with the separating tool then arranged alongside it. If the base material consists of boards, it<br>
expediently lies on a support, and the cutting knives or saw blades are pushed from top to bottom<br>
into or preferably through the base material.<br>
The cutting knives or saw blades are preferably arranged together in groups, wherein the cutting<br>
knives or saw blades of each group respectively produce a material attenuation which - as seen<br>
in a top view - is framed by the adjacent material cells and bridges. Within each of the groups,<br>
the cutting knives or saw blades of the respective group are arranged close to each other in<br>
accordance with the shape of the material cells and attenuations, respectively. For producing<br>
hexagonal material cells, each of the groups consists of three cutting knives or saw blades which,<br>
within each group, are arranged close to each other in accordance with the angles of the<br>
hexagons. In the case of for example square or rhombic material cells, the individual groups<br>
would be formed by cutting knives or saw blades arranged crosswise or in the shape of an ;'X"<br>
with respect to each other. In the case of the preferred hexagons, the cutting knives or saw blades<br>
of each group are in a Y-shape with respect to each other, in cross-section; in the case of the<br>
particularly preferred equilateral hexagons, they are each at an angle of 120° to each other. The<br>
cutting knives or saw blades of the individual groups each cut or saw one limb of the material<br>
attenuations. Instead of arranging separately produced cutting knives or saw blades into groups<br>
of cutting knives or saw blades, the groups can each be formed in one piece.<br>
Preferably, the cutting knives or saw blades are moved, expediently pushed, into or through the<br>
base material at least substantially vertically with respect to the surface forming the upper side of<br>
the base material; the pushing direction is preferably exactly orthogonal to the surface in<br>
question.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments, the cutting knives or saw blades are only moved in a single plane<br>
when cutting or sawing, wherein the cutting or sawing movement is a linear movement in<br>
preferred embodiments. The saw blades preferably each exhibit a thickness which corresponds to<br>
the width of the material attenuations. If groups are formed, as is preferred, then the saw blades<br>
of each group form a cross-section which corresponds to the cross-section of the material<br>
attenuations. In such embodiments, the saw blades saw into or preferably through the base<br>
material by means of a linear movement or a movement in one plane only, i.e. they are not<br>
moved transverse to their pushing direction relative to the base material, in order to produce the<br>
material attenuations. Incorporating the material attenuations by means of simply moving the<br>
cutting knives or saw blades reciprocally in this way expedites the cutting or sawing process. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the cutting knives or saw blades comprise a cutting edge or row of saw<br>
teeth which is inclined with respect to the pushing direction. The cutting edge or row of saw-<br>
teeth preferably extends up to a tip of each cutting knife or saw blade which protrudes in the<br>
pushing direction. The cutting process thus involves stabbing and then, while moving the cutting<br>
knife in the pushing direction, a cutting engagement with the base material which continues<br>
transverse to the pushing direction in the base material. The sawing process proceeds according<br>
to the same pattern, but with a sawing engagement between the saw blade and the cellular<br>
material instead of the cutting engagement.<br>
When cutting or sawing in batches, the separating tool preferably performs a reciprocal stroke<br>
movement composed of the pushing movement into and preferably through the cellular material<br>
and the reverse movement.<br>
The separating tool can be fitted with cutting knives or saw blades, preferably groups of cutting<br>
knives or groups of saw blades, over its entire area in accordance widi the structuring of the<br>
reinforcing structure to be provided, such that the cutting or sawing process can be performed in<br>
a single stroke for each initial board. In alternative embodiments, the cutting or sawing tool only<br>
comprises a beam or other support, from which the cutting knives or saw blades, preferably the<br>
groups of cutting knives or groups of saw blades, project alongside each other in a row along a<br>
line. During a stroke movement, material attenuations are thus only produced alongside each<br>
other on a line, such that the separating tool has to be subsequently moved transverse to the<br>
support relative to the initial board and successively incorporates one line of material<br><br>
attenuations after the other. Instead of the tool or as applicable in addition, the initial board can<br>
also be moved spatially, in order to incorporate one line of material attenuations after the other.<br>
If the base material is sufficiently flexible that it can be wound onto a reel even without the<br>
material attenuations, then incorporating the material attenuations is possible in a continuous<br>
method. Such materials, for example PE or PP foams, are unwound in a continuous method<br>
embodiment from a reel and guided through a roller gap formed by two rollers rotating opposite<br>
to each other or at least by one roller together with a counter-pressure means which is fixed as<br>
applicable. The material attenuations are incorporated in the gap. The roller or more preferably at<br>
least one roller of the pair of rollers forming the gap is fitted with the cutting knives or saw<br>
blades. The rollers or the roller and its counter-pressure means which is formed differently co-<br>
operate as a male and female mould. In preferred method embodiments, the web is successively<br>
guided through multiple gaps, preferably through at least two gaps, wherein the male mould of<br>
one gap is fitted with cutting knives and the female mould of the at least one other gap is fitted<br>
with saw blades.<br>
If, as is preferred, the separating process involves at least one cutting process and then at least<br>
one sawing process, the base material is preferably fed automatically to the cutting tool and then<br>
to the sawing tool, in a batch operation for example by means of a conveyor belt or other form of<br>
continuous conveying means, and in a continuous process as a web product which is conveyed<br>
through roller gaps arranged sequentially in the conveying direction.<br>
In addition to the manufacturing method, the subject of the invention also includes a reinforcing<br>
structure as such, obtained by means of the method in accordance with the invention, and also a<br>
composite in a sandwich construction which comprises at least two covering layers and, between<br>
the covering layers, an inserted reinforcing structure of the type in accordance with the<br>
invention, as well as a joiner which permeates the reinforcing structure and connects it in a<br>
material connection to both covering layers, and which is preferably formed by a synthetic resin<br>
or an adhesive. The covering layers can in particular be plastic layers or also metal layers, for<br>
example light metal layers. The composite can also comprise additional covering layers and<br>
additional reinforcing structures, and can in particular be manufactured in a multiple sandwich<br>
construction. A double sandwich comprising mree covering layers, namely an outer, a middle<br>
and another outer covering layer and two reinforcing structures respectively arranged between<br><br>
the outer covering layers and the middle covering layer, may serve as an example. It is also<br>
possible to arrange one or more reinforcing structures produced in accordance with the<br>
invention, one on top of the other, between covering layers, wherein the lower or lowermost<br>
reinforcing structure is adjacent to a lower covering layer, and the upper or uppermost<br>
reinforcing structure is adjacent to an upper covering layer.<br>
Preferred features are also disclosed in the sub-claims and combinations of the sub-claims.<br>

Figure 1 shows a reinforcing structure made of a cellular material, preferably a plastic foam<br>
material. Reinforcing structures, for example filaments, can be embedded in the cellular material,<br>
however the cellular material is preferably a non-reinforced cellular material. The reinforcing<br>
structure consists of polygonal material cells 1, in the example embodiment hexagonal material<br>
cells 1, and relatively thin connecting bridges 2. The material cells 1 are connected on each of<br>
their sides to the nearest adjacent material cell 1 via a central connecting bridge 2. Due to their<br>
hexagonal shape, each of the material cells 1 is connected to its nearest adjacent material cells 1<br>
via six connecting bridges 2. The width of the material cells 1, as measured in each direction of<br>
the plane of view, is clearly larger than the length of the connecting bridges 2. The space<br><br>
between the respectively nearest adjacent material cells 1 is free, apart from the connecting<br>
bridges 2. The cavities which thus remain free between the material cells 1 form material<br>
attenuations 3 as compared to a non-structured plate-like or mat-like cellular base material.<br>
Depending on the bending resistance of the plate-like or mat-like base material, these cavities or<br>
material attenuations 3 facilitate - or even at all enable to an appreciable extent - three-<br>
dimensional defotmability. Primarily, the reinforcing structure 1, 2 can be three-dimensionally<br>
deformed, i.e. bent about multiple axes which do not point parallel to each other, by shifting the<br>
material cells 1 relative to each other, namely by deforming the connecting bridges 2. The<br>
reinforcing structure 1 is therefore suitable as a core material for three-dimensionally curved<br>
lightweight composites in a sandwich construction. The material attenuations 3 also in particular<br>
enable the penetration of a joiner 17, for example a synthetic resin or adhesive mass, by which<br>
two covering layers can be fixedly connected to each other in a material connection via the<br>
reinforcing structure 1, 2. The joiner 17 preferably completely fills the spaces remaining free<br>
between the material cells 1 in the region of the material attenuations 3 and accordingly forms a<br>
honeycombed reinforcing structure for the covering layers in the hardened composite, or if the<br>
reinforcing structure 1, 2 is structured differently, forms this predetermined other reinforcing<br>
structure.<br>
Figure 2 shows the reinforcing structure 1, 2 in a non-deformed initial state in which the<br>
reinforcing structure 1, 2 substantially forms a planar mat or plate structured in accordance with<br>
the shape of the material cells 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the reinforcing structure 1, 2 in a deformed state in which nearest adjacent<br>
material cells 1 point at an inclined angle to each other, due to bending in the connecting bridge<br>
2 respectively connecting them.<br>
The reinforcing structure 1, 2 is produced in batches from a plate-like or mat-like cellular base<br>
material, an initial board, or continuously from a web material in multiple method steps. The<br>
initial board or web product exhibits a material thickness which at least substantially corresponds<br>
to the material cells 1 throughout. It is a homogenous, non-structured board or web material<br>
which however exhibits a microscopic and as applicable also macroscopic cellular structure<br>
having a correspondingly low density. For the example embodiment, it may be assumed that it is<br>
a plastic foam material. Such foam materials can in particular be produced by extrusion and<br><br>
separated into the initial boards to be processed, or can be wound onto a reel as a web product if<br>
the base material is correspondingly flexible.<br>
The material attenuations 3 are incorporated into such a cellular base material in a multi-stage<br>
method by cutting and then sawing. Once the multi-stage separating process - which involves at<br>
least one cutting process and at least one sawing process - has been completed, the connecting<br>
bridges 2 remaining between the material cells 1 and material attenuations 3 thus obtained are<br>
compacted by compression and their cross-section thus reduced, such that the compacted bridges<br>
2 fall short of both the upper side and the lower side of the material cells 1, as can for example<br>
be seen in Figures 2 and 3. The bridges 2 can be compacted with or without being heated.<br>
Reducing the cross-section of the bridges 2 by compression represents a method which is simple<br>
and therefore inexpensive to perform mechanically and which provides contact areas for the<br>
joiner 17 to the respective covering layer of the composite in the region of the material<br>
attenuations 3.<br>
Before the bridges 2 are compacted or more preferably after the bridges 2 have been compacted,<br>
or as applicable at the same time as the bridges 2 are compacted, the material cells 1 arc<br>
compacted by means of compression in a near-surface range of depth on each of the upper side<br>
and lower side, in order to round the edges of the material cells 1 which are still sharp-edged<br>
after the separating process. In Figures 1 to 3, the already rounded edges are provided with the<br>
reference sign 4. The material cells 1 can also either be heated at least in their near-surface range<br>
of depth to support compacting this material, or can also be compacted at ambient temperature,<br>
by means of pressure only. On the one hand, rounding the edges 4 prevents notching effects and<br>
on the other hand advantageously increases the contact area available to the joiner 17 to the<br>
covering layer of the composite situated on the respective upper or lower side of the reinforcing<br>
structure 1,2.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 respectively show a cutting knife 5 and a saw blade 7 in a lateral view. For<br>
incorporating the material attenuations 3, a plurality of cutting knives 5 are arranged on a cutting<br>
tool and an equal plurality of saw blades 7 are arranged on a sawing tool. The cutting tool can for<br>
example be formed by a cutting beam on which the cutting knives 5 are arranged, projecting<br>
from the cutting beam towards the base material to be processed. The sawing tool can similarly<br>
comprise such a sawing beam for the saw blades 7 which are arranged on the sawing beam.<br><br>
projecting towards the base material. The cutting knives 5 and the saw blades 7 are arranged on<br>
the respective tool in groups of three, each consisting of three cutting knives 5 or saw blades 7<br>
which point in a Y-shape with respect to each other, as shown in the views from below in<br>
Figures 4a and 5a. The respective tool can be moved back and forth in a pushing direction which<br>
is indicated on the cutting knife 5 and saw blade 7 by a directional arrow, such that in the<br>
respective stroke movement, the cutting knives 5 of the cutting tool or saw blades 7 of the<br>
sawing tool are pushed towards and through the base material in the pushing direction. The<br>
cutting knives 5 each comprise a tip protruding in the pushing direction and, inclined from this<br>
with respect to the pushing direction - in the example embodiment, inclined at a constant angle<br>
of inclination - a cutting edge 6 comparable to a guillotine, such that the cutting knives 5 stab<br>
into the base material with their tip first and then continue to cut through along the respective<br>
cutting edge 6, in order to obtain an even cut.<br>
The sawing process is performed after cutting, wherein the saw blades 7 are positioned exactly<br>
opposite the incorporated cuts and then moved in the plotted pushing direction relative to the<br>
initial material provided with the cuts. The saw blades 7 are moved forwards along the cuts.<br>
They likewise comprise a tip at their protruding ends in the pushing direction, comparable to the<br>
cutting knives 5, from which a row of saw teedi 8 inclined with respect to the pushing direction<br>
tapers off counter to the pushing direction, comparable to the cutting edge 6. As a first<br>
approximation, the effect of the saw blades 7 is comparable to a jig or sabre saw, however due to<br>
the inclined row of saw teeth 8, a force acting in the pushing direction is sufficient in order to<br>
widen the previously produced cut by a sawing process continuing from the respective tip of the<br>
saw blade towards a respectively nearest adjacent connecting bridge 2 or continuing away from a<br>
respectively nearest adjacent connecting bridge 2. During sawing, the material attenuation 3 is<br>
widened in accordance with the thickness of the saw blades 7, in particular the thickness of the<br>
rows of saw teeth 8.<br>
The cutting knives 5 exhibit a width of preferably at least 300 µm and preferably at most 800<br>
urn. The saw blades 7 preferably exhibit a larger width of preferably at least 400 um and<br>
preferably at most 2 mm.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a bridge presser 9 using which one of the bridges 2 can be compressed and<br>
thus compacted after cutting and sawing, such that the cross-section of the bridge 2 in question is<br><br>
permanently reduced. On a lower side 10, via which it presses against the bridge 2 during<br>
compression, the bridge presser 9 comprises a central recess 11. The recess 11 is semi-<br>
cylindrical - in the example embodiment, semi-circular cylindrical - and extends over the entire<br>
lower side 10. The compacted bridge 2 comes to rest in the recess 11 at the end of the<br>
compacting stroke. The bridges 2 are each compressed by means of two bridge pressers 9, one of<br>
which faces and opposes the upper side of the reinforcing structure 1, 2 and the other of which<br>
faces and opposes the lower side of the reinforcing structure 1,2. The bridge pressers 9 are<br>
moved towards each other in pairs - as applicable, one of the bridge pressers 9 can remain at rest<br>
while only the other one is moved - until the bridge 2 in question has been compacted to the<br>
desired final shape. The movement direction of the bridge presser 9 is indicated by a directional<br>
arrow. In a preferred embodiment, bridge pressers 9 project from a forming tool in a number and<br>
arrangement which corresponds to the number and arrangement of the bridges 2 to be<br>
compacted. Another such forming tool is arranged facing the other side of the reinforcing prc-<br>
structure produced by cutting and sawing. The bridge pressers 9 each exhibit a thickness which<br>
at least substantially corresponds to the length of the bridges 2.<br>
Figure 7 shows a top presser 12 by means of which one of the material cells 1 is compacted on<br>
its upper side or lower side by compression, wherein the material cell 1 is primarily compacted<br>
along the edges 4 obtained by sawing, wherein the edge 4 in question is primarily rounded. The<br>
top presser 12 comprises a hollow space 13 on its lower side facing the reinforcing structure 1,2.<br>
The hollow space 13 is trough-shaped. During compression, it accommodates the upper or lower<br>
side of one of the material cells 1. At its circumferential edge, the hollow space 13 tapers out in a<br>
curve, the shape of which corresponds to the desired curve for the edges 4 of the material cells 1.<br>
A forming tool is arranged facing each of the upper side and lower side of the reinforcing<br>
structure 1, 2 and is provided with a number of top pressers 12 corresponding to the number and<br>
shape of the material cells 1. In this forming step, the material cells 1 arc compressed between<br>
the top pressers 12 of the two tools and thus compacted near the surface, at least in the region of<br>
the edges 4.<br>
The reinforcing structure 1. 2 can be produced from an initial board made of the cellular base<br>
material in a batch process as follows:<br><br>
As already mentioned, the cutting knives 5 are arranged on the cutting tool along a support of the<br>
tool in groups of three cutting knives 5 each, wherein the cutting knives 5 of each group of three<br>
are arranged in a Y-shape with respect to each other. The saw blades 7 are correspondingly<br>
arranged along a support of the sawing tool. Initial boards of the cellular material are conveyed<br>
through successively and in steps, below the cutting tool and the sawing tool. In each stroke<br>
movement of the cutting tool, the cutting knives 5 produce one cut in the region of the material<br>
attenuations 3 to be provided. The cut regions are then sawn out by means of a stroke movement<br>
of the sawing tool and the saw blades 7 projecting from it.<br>
The boards respectively provided after these processes as reinforcing pre-structures are conveyed<br>
to the forming tool comprising the bridge pressers 9, where the bridges 2 are compacted. In the<br>
final step, the edges 4 of the material cells 1 are rounded by means of another forming tool<br>
bearing a plurality of top pressers 12. In a variant, the order of the two compacting operations<br>
can be reversed. It is also possible to compact the bridges 2 and round the edges 4 of the material<br>
cells 1 at the same location, and as applicable at the same time. In such embodiments, a<br>
combined forming tool comprises both the bridge pressers 9 and the top pressers 12, wherein the<br>
bridge pressers 9 can be moved in the compressing direction relative to the top pressers 12. The<br>
bridges 2 and material cells 1 can be compacted while cold, at ambient temperature. In a further<br>
development, the bridge pressers 9 are tempered to a temperature slightly below the melting<br>
point of the cellular base material. In another further development, the top pressers 12 are<br>
tempered to such a temperature. It is also possible to correspondingly temper the bridge pressers<br>
9 and the top pressers 12.<br>
Figure 8 shows a composite comprising an upper covering layer 15 and a lower covering layer<br>
16, each consisting of a plastic material. The reinforcing structure 1, 2 is sandwiched between<br>
the covering layers 15 and 16. The material attenuations 3 are filled with a joiner 17, preferably a<br>
hardened resin. The joiner 17 conforms to the honeycombed structure of the material cells 1 and<br>
fills the former material attenuatioas 3.<br><br>
