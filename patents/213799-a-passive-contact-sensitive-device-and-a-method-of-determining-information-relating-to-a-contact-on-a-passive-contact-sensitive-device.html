				<td>TITLE: CONTACT SENSITIVE DEVICE<br>
10<br>
Description<br><br><br>
15 					TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to contact sensitive devices<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 		Visual display often include some from of touch<br>
	sensitive screen. This is becoming more common with the<br>
20	emergence on the next generation of portable multimedia <br>
	devices such as palm top computers. The most established<br>
	technology using waves to detect contact is Surface AcoustiC <br>
	Wave (SAW), which generates high freguency waves on the<br>
	surface of a glass screen, and their attenuation by the <br>
25 	contact 	of a finger is used to detect the touch location.This<br>
	technique is "time-of-flight", where the time for the<br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
2<br>
	disturbance to reach one or more sensors is used to detect the<br>
	location. Such an approach is possible when the medium beheves<br>
	in a non-dispersive manner i.e the velocity of the waves dose<br>
	not Vary significantly over the f requency range of interest .<br>
5 		In WO01/48684 and PCT/GB2O02/OO3O73 to the present<br>
	applicant, two contact sensitive devices and methods of using<br>
	the Same are proposed. In both applications, the device<br>
	coinprises a member capable of supporting bending wave<br>
	vibration and a sensor mounted on the member for measuring <br>
10 	bending wavs vibiration in the member and for transmiting a<br>
	signal to a processor whereby information relating to a<br>
	contact made on a surface on the member is calculated from the <br>
	change in bending wave vibration in the member created by the<br>
	contact.<br>
15		 By bending wave vibration it is meant an excitation, for<br>
	example by the contact ,which imparts some out of plane<br>
	displacement to the member . Many materials bend , some with<br>
	pure bending with a perfect square root dispersion relation<br>
	and some with a mixture of pure and shear bending. The<br>
20 	dispersion relation describes the dependence of the in-plane<br>
	velocity of the waves on the frequency of the waves.<br>
		Bending waves provide advantagss, such as incressed<br>
	robustness and reduced, sensitivity to surface scratches, etc.<br>
	However, bending waves are dispersive i.e. the bending wave<br>
25 	velocity, and hence the "time of flight", is dependent on<br>
	frequency. In general, an impulse contains a broad range of<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
3<br>
	component frequencies and thus if the impulse travels a short<br>
	distance, high frequency components will arrive first. In<br>
	W001/48684 and PCT/GB2002/O03073 a correction to convert the<br>
	measured bending wavs signal to a propagation signal from a<br>
5 	non-dispersive wave source may be applied so that techniques<br>
	used in the fields of radar and sonar may be applied so that techniques<br>
	the location of the contact.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
		According to one aspect of the invention, there is<br>
10 	Provided a contact sensitive device comprising a member<br>
	capable of supporting bending waves, three sensors mounted on<br>
	the member for measuring wave vibration in the member<br>
	whereby each sensor determines a measured bending wave signal<br>
	and a processor which calculates a location of a contact on<br>
15 	the member from the measured bending wave signals,<br>
	charecterised in that the processor calculates a phase angle<br>
	for each measured bending wave signal, then calculates a phase<br>
	difference between the phase angles of least two pairs of<br>
	sensors from which the location of the contact is determined. <br>
20 		According to a second aspect of the invention, there is<br>
	provided a method of determining information relating to a<br>
	contact on a contact sensitive device comprising the steps of<br>
	providing a member capable of supporting bending waves and<br>
	three sensors mounted on the member for measuring bending wave<br>
25 	vibration in the member, applying a contact to the member at a<br>
	location, using each sensor to determine a measured bending<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
4<br>
	wave signal and calculating the location of a contact from the <br>
	measured bending wave signal characterised by calculating a<br>
	phase angle for each measured bending wave signal, calculating<br>
	a phase difference between the phase angel of at least two<br>
5 	pairs of sensor and determining the location of the contact<br>
	from the at least two calculated phase differences.<br>
		The following features may be applied to both the device<br>
	and the method with the processor being adapted to provide<br>
	many of the calculation or processing steps of the method.<br>
10 		Reflected waves may be suppressed by placing an absorber<br>
	in contact with edges of the member.The mechanical <br>
	impedance of the absorber and member may be selected so as to<br>
	minimise reflections of bending waves from the edges of the<br>
	member. In particular, the impedances may be selected such<br>
15 	that bending wave energy is strongly absorbed in a frequency<br>
	band around a chosen frequency . The impedance of the<br>
	absorber may be selected to be both resistive and compliant.<br>
	The impedances may be selected to satisfy the following<br>
	equation.<br>
20 						ZT = -iZE()<br>
		where Zr is the termination impedance of the obsorber and<br>
	ZB is the mechanical impedance of the edge of the member.<br>
		The absorber may be made from foamed plastics which may<br>
	have open or closed cells and may be polyurethane or<br>
25 polivinylchloride. For example the from may be a short PVC <br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268 ,<br>
5<br>
	predominantly closed cell from such as MIERS1w or a medium to <br>
	high density, open cell polyurethane foam. Another class of<br>
	foams that has been found to be suitable are acrylic closed<br>
	cell foams. These may have a high degree of damping and<br>
5 relatively high stiffness. Such properties are particularly<br>
	suited to edge termination of stiff heavy materials such as<br>
	glass. Examples include 3M serial numbers 4956, 4910, 4950<br>
	and 4555. The absorber may extend substantially around the<br>
	periphery of the member. The absorber0 may act as a mounting<br>
10 	which supports the member in a frame or to another surface. <br>
		The member may comprise a raised pattern on its surface<br>
	whereby a contact drawn across the surface provides a variable<br>
	force to the member to generate bending waves in the members. <br>
	The pattern may be periodic, or quasi-periodic with a<br>
15	statistically well-defind spatial distribution of <br>
	undulations. The pattern may be random whereby a contact<br>
	travelling over the surface of the member generates a random<br>
	bending wave signal. The random relief pattern may be an anti-<br>
	reflective coating, an anti-glare surface finish or an etched <br>
20 	finish such as those which are found on many known transparent<br>
	panels placed in front of electronic displays.<br>
		Each measured bending wave signal may be processed by a<br>
	band-pass filter with a pass-band centred at the chosen<br>
	frequency  and having a bandwidth  The bandwidth  of<br>
25	 the filter is preferably chosen to address the Doppler effect<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
6<br>
	whereby a bending wave arrives at a point with a different <br>
	frequency from its original frequency. Accordingly, the<br>
	bandwidth, preferably obeys the relationship:<br><br>
5		 where vmax is the maxmimum lateral velocity of the contact <br>
	across the surface, e.g. if the contact is provided by a<br>
	stylus, vmax is the maximum velocity that a user is capable of <br>
	moving the stylus. '<br>
		The phase of each filtered signal may be measured by<br>
10	 comparison with a reference signal. the reference signal may <br>
	have a frequency   . The measured phase is the average phase<br>
	difference between the input and reference signals, optimally<br>
	measured over the interval  . Alternatively, the reference<br>
	signal may be derived from a filtered signal from a second<br>
15 	sensor in which case, the measured phase is the phase <br>
	difference between two input signals.<br>
	The phase differences may be calculated at intervale of<br>
	  which may be intervals of less than 10ms. The reference<br>
	and input signals may be fed to a phase detector. Output from<br>
20 	the phase detectors may be fed through low-pass filters having<br>
	frequency cut-offs of approximately  , then through<br>
	digitisers and finally through a processor to calculate the<br>
	phase angle  .<br>
		The instantaneous phases,   and  , of two measured<br>
25 	bending wave signals may satisfy the phase difference equation<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT7GB2003/005268<br>
	equation:<br><br>
		where   being the distance from the<br>
	contact location to each sensor lebelled m and 1<br>
5 	respectively) , and   is the wavevector. This equation may<br>
	be satisfied if the path lenth difference between two sensor <br>
	is less than the coherence length of the bandpass filter, <br>
	which is defined as<br><br>
10 		The coherence condition is therefore   If the<br>
	 coherence condition is not satisfiecl, the above phase equation<br>
	may not be satisfied.<br>
		Thus, values of   and the phase angle difference are<br>
	required to determine the location of the contact. The Shape<br>
15 	of the member may be selected to constrain the magnitude of<br>
	  to values less than half of one wavelength, ie.<br>
	  In this case, where all possible values of  <br>
	satisfy the condition   ,there is only one value of<br>
	   which is the integer    satisfying  <br>
20 	Alternatively, n may be estimated or inferred in some way.<br>
		Each phase angle difference in combination with the range<br>
	of possible values of the integer im may be used to generate <br>
	a series of path length difference thereby difining a series <br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
8<br>
	of discrete hyperbolic corves on the surface of the member, <br>
	denoting possible location of the contact. The location of<br>
	the contact may be determined by plotting each hyperbola<br>
	defined by each path length difference and selecting a point<br>
5 	at which a large number of the hyperbolae interaect or nearly<br>
	interest. This point is likely to be the true location of <br>
	the contact.<br>
		where   is unknown, the minimum number of series of <br>
	hyperbolae required to determine the contact location is three<br>
10	and the likelihood of determining the correct location of the<br>
	contact, is increased by increasing the number of hyperbolae to<br>
	be plotted. Multiple sensors may be used whereby a phase<br>
	angle difference may be calculated for each pair of sensors<br>
	thus generating multiple hyperbolae. In this embodiment, the<br>
15 	minimum number of sensore is three.<br>
		Alternatively, where   is unknown, the measured bending<br>
	wave signal from each sensor may be divided into two or more<br>
	discrete frequency bands whereby a phase angle difference may<br>
	be calculated for each frequency band and for each pair of<br>
20 	sensor. Although multiple phase angel differences may be<br>
	calculated from a single pair of sensors, the phase angle<br>
	differences at different frequencies are derived from the same<br>
	path length difference. Thus the minimum number of sensors is<br>
	three. The dividing of the frequency bands may be achieved by<br>
25 	processing the bending wave signals by at least two band-pass<br>
	filters having different pass-band frequency. For exmaple, <br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005368<br>
9<br>
	using two band-pass filters having frequencies  <br>
	the phase angle differences   from two sensors may be<br>
	defined as<br><br>
5					 <br>
		where   is a single path-length difference defined by<br>
	the contact and the position of the sensors.<br>
		Therefore the values of na and nb may be selected so that<br>
	the measured phase angle differences infer similar values of<br>
10	 the path-length difference. There may be only one combination<br>
	of values   for which this is possible. In this case<br>
	the true value of the path-length difference may be<br>
	detetermined. The correct combination   may be determined <br>
	as the combination of values that minimise the expression:<br>
15		 <br>
		The path length difference may then be estimated, as :<br><br>
		Where this process is repeated with two pairs of sensors,<br>
	two path length differences may be determined, which in turn<br>
20 	may be used to determine the location of the contact. <br>
		 Alternatively, where   is unknown, an initial <br>
	determination of the location of the contact may be made using<br>
	the methods taught in WO01/48684 and PCT/GB2002/003073 (as<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
10<br>
	summarised in figure 111. Thereafter it may be assumed that <br>
	the coneace moves more slowly than the bending waves and hence<br>
	that the phase angle differences change by small increments<br>
	over the timescale  . Accordingly, each value of   may be<br>
5 	chosen to minimise the change in path length difference.<br>
		 Measured phase angle differences may contain random<br>
	errors which may result in the selection of incorrect values <br>
	of n. This error may be alleviated by evaluating the<br>
	likelihood of successive sequences of   for example by a<br>
10 	state spaee estimator such as the well known Kalman filter.<br>
	The sequence having the maximum measure of likelihood its<br>
	selected.<br>
	The state-space estimator provides an estimate of the <br>
	internal state of asystem of a which noisy measurements are<br>
15 	made. A necessary input to the state-space estimator is a <br>
	statistical description of the evolution of the system state.<br>
	An example of such a state is the set of coordinates that<br>
	describes the position and velocity of an object in contact <br>
	with the member, It is widely known that the Kalman filter and<br>
20	other state-space estimatore my provide a measure of<br>
	likelihood that a sequence of observed, noisy measurements are<br>
	consistent with the model of the system state.<br>
		 A state-space estimator may therefore be employed to take <br>
	a sequence of a pair of path-length differences (say   and<br>
25 	  taken at different times (say , to estimate<br><br><br>
WO2004/os3781							 PCT/GB2003/005262<br>
11<br>
	the system-state,i.e. the position and velocity of the <br>
	contact, at those time, Moroever, the overall likelihood of <br>
	those values of path-length difference being consisteng with<br>
	the model of the system may be evaluated.<br>
5 	Where the sequence Of path-length differences are<br>
	of integers  , the measure of<br>
	likelihood generated by the state-space estimator may be used<br>
	to infer the likelihood that the correct values of n were<br>
10 chosen. It follows that a method for choosing the correct<br>
	sequence of integers, n, is to find the sequence for which the<br>
	state-space estimator gives the maximam measure of likelihood,<br>
	 	As mentioned above, the state space estimator uses some <br>
	statistical description of the evolution of the system state.<br>
15 	A suitable model for the motion of the contact may be a simple<br>
	random walk. Alternatively, the model may employ a detailed<br>
	statistical description of how the user moves the stylus or<br>
	finger. One example is a statistical description of how the<br>
	user moves a pen while writing text or individual characters.<br>
20 		The processor may further be adapted to include in the<br>
	determination procedure any available information about where<br>
	the contact can be expected. For example, if the member is an<br>
	input device for a graphical user interface where the user is<br>
	presented with a choice of ' buttons' to press, it msy be<br>
25 	useful to assume that any contact on the member occurs within<br>
	the discrete areas corresponding to the buttons.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
12<br>
		Alternatively, a map of the probability at which a <br>
	contact is likely to occur and which is based on the expected<br>
	behaviour of the user may be used. The device may comprise a<br>
	software application with a graphical user interface (GUI)<br>
5	 which interacts with the operating system by means of an <br>
	application program interface (API) in which the API is<br>
	adapted to generate the probability map. The probability map<br>
	may be based on the location , size, and frequency of use of<br>
	objects presented by the graphical user interface. The<br>
10 	probability map may also be based on information about the <br>
	relative likelihood of the various GUI elements being <br>
	activated.<br>
		The following characteristics may apply to all<br>
	embodiments of the invention. The device may comprise means<br>
15 	for recording measured bending wave signals from the or each<br>
	sensor over time as the contact moves across the member. The<br>
	information relating to the contact may be calculated in a<br>
	central processor. The sensors may be mounted at or spaced<br>
	from an edge of the member. The sensors may be in the form of<br>
20 sensing transducers which may convert bending wave vibration<br>
	into an analogue input signal.<br>
		The member may be in the form of a plate or panel. The<br>
	member may be transparent or alternatively non-transparent,<br>
	for example having a printed pattern. The member may have<br>
25 	uniform thickness. Alternatively, the member may have a more<br>
	complex shape , for example a curved surf see and /or variable<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
13<br>
	thickness. <br>
		The device may be a purely passive sensor with the<br>
	bending wave vibration and hence the measured bending wave<br>
	signals being generated by an initial impact or by frictional<br>
5 	movement of the contact . The contact may be in the from of a<br>
	touch from a finger or from a stylus which may be in the form<br>
	of a hand—held pen. The movement of a stylus on the member may<br>
	generate a continuous signal which is affected by the<br>
	location, pressure and speed of the stylus on the member. The <br>
10 	stylus may have a flexible tip e.g. of rubber, which<br>
	generete bending waves in the member by applyig a variable<br>
	force thereto.The variable force may be provided by tip<br>
	Which alternatively adheres to or slips across a surface of<br>
	The member. As the tip moves across of the member a tensile<br>
15 force may be created which at a certain threshold, causes any<br>
	adhesion between the tip and the member to break, thus<br>
	allowing the tip to slip across the surface. The bending waves<br>
	may have frequency components in the ultrasonic region<br>
	(&gt;20 kHz).<br>
20 		The member may also be an acoustic radiator and an<br>
	emitting transducer may be mounted to the member to excite<br>
	bending wave vibration in the member to generate an acoustic<br>
	output. The frequency band of the audio signal of the<br>
	transducer preferably differs from and does not overlap the <br>
25 	frequency band of the measurements from the sensor. The<br>
	audio signal may thus be filtered, for example, the audio band<br><br><br>
WO 2004/53781 							PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
14<br>
	may be limited to frequency below 20kHz.and the vibration<br>
	measurements may be limited to frequencies above 20kHz. A<br>
	sensor may have dual functionaliy and act as the emmiting<br>
	transducer.<br>
5 		The or each emitting transducer or sensor may be a bender<br>
	transducer which is bonded directly to the member, for example<br>
	a piezoelectric transducer. Alternatively, the or each<br>
	emitting transducer or sensor may be an inertial transducer<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
10 		Figure 1 shows a contact sensitive device 10 comprising a<br>
	transparent touch sensitive plate 12 mounted in front of a<br>
	display device 14. The display device 14 may be in the form<br>
	of a television, a computer screen or other visual display<br>
	device. A stylus 18 in the form of a pen is used for writing<br>
15	 text 20 or other matter on the touch sensitive plate 12.<br>
		The transparent touch sensitive olate 12 is a member,<br>
	e.g. an acoustic device, capable of supporting bending wave<br>
	vibration. As shown in figure 2, four sensor 16 for <br>
	measuring being have vibration in the plate 12 are mounted<br>
20 	on the underside thereof. The sensors 16 are in the form of<br>
	piezoelectric vibration sensor and are mounted one at each<br>
	corner of the plate 12. At least one of the sensor 16 may <br>
	also act as an emitting transducer for exciting bending wave<br>
	vibration in the plate. in this way, ths dsvics may act as a<br>
25 	combined loudspeaker and contact sensitive device.<br>
		A mounting 22 made of foamed plastics is attached to the <br><br><br>
WO2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268 <br>
17<br>
	underside of and extends substantially around the periphery of<br>
	the plate 12. The mounting 22 has adhesive surfaces whereby<br>
	the member may be securely attached to any surfacs. The<br>
	mechanical impedance of the mounting and plate are selected so<br>
5 	as to minimise reflections of having waves from the plate <br>
	edges.<br>
		The relationship between mechanical impedance of the<br>
	mounting and the plate may be approximated by considering the<br>
	one dimensional model shown in Figure 3. The model comprises a <br>
10 	waveguide 34 in the form of a beam which terminates at an edge<br>
	mounting 36 having a termination impedence. An incident waves<br>
	38 travelling down the waveguide 34 is reflected by the<br>
	mounting 36 to form a reflected waves 40. The incident and<br>
	reflected Waves are plane waves travelling in the direction<br>
15 	perpendicular to the edge. Assuming the mounting 36 Satisfies<br>
	the following boundary conditions:<br>
	(i) the termination impedance only couples into the lateral <br>
	velocity, i.e. it does not provide any torgue registance; <br>
	whereby the bending moment is equal to zero at the edge and<br>
20 	(ii) The ratio of the lateral shear force and the velocity at<br>
	the edge is equal to the terminal impedance; <br>
		The reflection coefficient at the mounting is given by<br><br>
		where Zr is the termination impedance of the mounting and<br>
25 	ZB is the mechanical impedance of the end of the waveguide.<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
18<br>
	given by<br><br>
		wheics K (w) , is the wavevector which may be expressed in<br>
	terms of the bending Stiffness, B, and pass per unit area,  ,<br>
5 	of the panel,<br><br>
		 Thus, the reflection confficient is determind by the <br>
	ratio of the impedances at the end of the waveguide and the<br>
	mounting. Furthermore, the impedance of the waveguide is<br>
10	 proportional to the square root of frequency and is both real<br>
	and reactive in equal weights (i.e. n/4 phase angle) .<br>
	Accordingly, the reflection coefficient is likely to be<br>
	strongly frequency dependent.<br>
		The reflection coefficient vanishes, i.e. bending wave<br>
15 	energy is strongly absorbed in a frequency band around   if<br>
	the following condition is satisfied: '<br><br>
		 Thus, the termination impedance of the mounting must have<br>
	both real and imaginary components, or, equivalent, the<br>
20 	mounting should be both resistive and compliant.<br>
		The plate may be, for example, 1 mm thick polycarbonate<br>
	sheet which has mass per unit area,   and<br>
	bending stiffness, B—0 = 38 Nm. The exquations above can be used <br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
19<br>
	to calculate the impedances of the plate and absorber required<br>
	to strongly absorb bending wave energy around the chosen<br>
	angular frequency   .<br>
		The impedance, per unit width for a 1mm beam<br>
5 	approximation of the plate is <br><br>
		The properties of the absorber which provide the desired<br>
	absorption are thus:<br>
	Resistance per unit width,<br><br>
		The reflection coefficient is a unitless complex number.<br>
	Figures 4a and 4b are graphs showing the amplitude and phass<br>
15 	of the reflection coefficient R(w) varying with frequency.<br>
	The amplitude of the reflection cofficient is zero ano its <br>
	phase is reversed for   approximately equal to 900HZ. <br>
		In Figures 5a and 5b, the plate 12 has uniform surface<br>
	roughness in the form of a raised surface pattern 28,29. The<br>
20 	stulus 18 is drawn accross the surface along a path 30 and as<br>
	it crosses a raised part or line of the pattern it generates<br>
	bending waves 32 in the member. Thus contact from the stylus<br>
	18 provides a source of bending wave vibration in the member.<br>
	In Figure 5a, the surface pattern 28 is a periodic pattern of<br>
25 	raised crossed lines and in Figure 5b, the surface pattern 29<br><br><br>
WO2004/053781							 PCT/GB20O3/005268<br>
20<br>
	is a random relief pattern.<br>
		In the embodiments of Figures 2, 5a and 5b, as the<br>
	contact moves ovsr the rough surface of the member r bending<br>
	waves radiate isotropically in the member from the point of <br>
5 	contact. The displacement of the member at a distance , x, from <br>
	the point of contact is related to the displacement at the <br>
	point of contact by a transfer function H   distance<br>
	larger than the wavelength,   , the transfer function<br>
	can be approximated as<br>
10	 <br>
		 Where A is a constant and K(is the wavevector defined<br>
	previously. Although   strictly only applies to bending<br>
	wavps on an infinite platet , sines the mounting is strongly<br>
	absorb bending wave vibration, the relationship is satisfied. <br>
15 	The transfer function shows that where a source of bending<br>
	frequency,   between displacements <br>
	at two locations which at distances, X1 and k2, from the<br>
	point of contact for the source is:<br>
20				 <br>
		This implies the following relationship between the phase<br>
	angle difference, the path length difference   and an<br>
	integer n12.<br><br><br><br>

		Figure 6 shows the steps in the method for using this<br>
	equation to determine the contact location:<br>
	a) Measure a bending wave signal with each sensor to give<br>
	measured bending wave signals  ,<br>
5 	b) Calculate the phase angles   of the measured<br>
	bending wave signals  <br>
	c) 	Calculate the difference between the two phase angles ,(t)<br>
	and  <br>

		Figure 7a shows a schematic block diagram of a device for<br>
	calculating the phase angle  )<br>
	measured by one of the sensors. The signal Wj (t) is a random<br>
	signal and is thus uncorrelated over long time scale. The <br>
15 signal is first amplified by an amplifier 42 and then<br>
	processed by an analogue band-pass filter 44 with a pass-band<br>
	centred at   <br>
		A moving source of bending waves inay demonstrate the<br>
	Doppler effect, whereby a bending wave which has frequency   <br>
20 	and is emitted by a source moving at velocity v towards a<br>
	point on a member arrives at that point with a different <br>
	frequency defined by   . The maximum angular frequency<br>
	shift between bending waves at two different points on the<br>
	member is therefore   is the maximum<br><br><br>
WO 2004/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
22<br>
	velocity of the moving source. If the angular frequency shift<br>
	becocomes larger than the width of the band pass filter, the<br>
	phase difference equation above does not hold. Accordingly,<br>
	the bandwidth   of the filter 44 is set to be greater than <br>
5 	this maximum frequency shift and thus obsys the relationship;<br><br>
		After processing by the filter 44, the resulting filtered<br>
	signal W'j(t) is an amplitude and phase modulated carrier with<br>
	frequency"   and is defined by:<br>
10<br><br>
	where   are the amplitude and phase of the<br>
	signal. Both fluctuate over a timescale   determined by the<br>
	bandwidth of the filter, namely  . The maximum<br>
	frequency at which independent phase angle measurements may be<br>
15 	taken from the output of the bandpass filter is  . Sice a<br>
	touch sensor typically provides an updated measurement of the<br>
	contact position every 10ms, the condition for the minimum<br>
	frequency of positional measurment is  .<br>
		The filtered signal W'j(t) is then passed simultaneously<br>
20 	to two analogue phase detectors 46. Such detectors are well<br>
	known in the art, for: example, see p644 of "The Art of<br>
	Electronics" by Horowitz and Hill. Reference signals each<br>
	having frequency   but a phase difference of n/2 are also fed<br>
	to the two phase detectors. The output of the phase <br><br><br>
WO 2O04/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
23<br>
	detectors are passed through low-pass filter 48 each having <br>
	frequency cut-offs of approximately  . The outputs of the<br>
	low-pass filters are proportional to cos  <br>
	respectively. These outputs are then digitised by digitisers<br>
5 	50 and processed by processor 52 to give the phase angle  <br>
		Figure 7b shows how the reference signals used in Figure<br>
	7a may be generated. A second bending wave signal Wi (t) is<br>
	measured at s second sensor. The signal is fed through an <br>
	amplifier 42 and analogue band-pass filter 44 to generate a<br>
10 	filtered signal W' j(t). The filtered signal W' j(t) forms the<br>
	reference signal which is fed directly to one phase detector<br>
	46. The filtered signal is also fed to the second phase<br>
	detector 46 via a device which shifts its pgase by   The<br>
	phase shifted signal is used as the reference signal to the <br>
15	second phase detector 46.<br>
		Figures 8a to 8d show how the phase angle differences<br>
	and hence the path length differencss may be used to calculate<br>
	the location of the contact. The equation in step (d) of<br>
	Figure 6 defines a hyperbolic curve which can be overlaid on <br>
20 the plate 12. Figure 8a shows the three hyperbolic curves 26<br>
	which ars generated using three different values of nim and<br>
	the calculated phase angle difference for a pair of sensors 16<br>
	mounted one on each end of the short sides of the plate 12. <br>
	Similarly Figures 8b and 8c show the hyperbolic curves 26<br>
	25 which are generated by the phase angle difference and<br><br><br>
WO 2O04/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br><br>
24<br>
	different values of   for two other pairs of sensors.<br>
	Figure 8d shows all the hyperbolic curves created by the<br>
	sensor . The contact location 24 is the point of intersection<br>
	of three hyperbolic curves , one from each pair of sensors.<br>
5 	Prom che contact location 24, the correct value of   may be<br>
	inferred. |<br>
		A method of inferring n is implemented using the<br>
	embodiment shown in figure 9. The bending wave signal W1(t)<br>
	measured by each sensor is sirnultaneously processed by two<br>
10 band-pass filters 48,54. Two phase angles, one for each<br>
	filter, are calculated, for example as described in Figure 7.<br>
	The filters 48, 54 have slightly different pass-band<br>
	frequencies whereby two phase angle differences, one tor each<br>
	pass-band frequency, are provided by each pair of sensors.<br>
15 	The phase angle differences   from the sensors may<br>
	be defined as<br><br>
		where   is a single path-length difference defined by<br>
20 	the contact and the position of the sensors.<br>
		The correct combination (na, nb) may ba determined as the<br>
	combination of values that minimise the expression:<br><br>
	The path length difference may then be estimated as:<br><br><br>
WO 2O04/053781							 PCT/GB2003/005268<br>
25<br><br>
		 Another pair of sensors may than be used to determine a <br>
	second path length difference. Each path length difference<br>
	defines a hyperbolic curve on the pannel. The intersection<br>
5 	point of these two hyperbolic curves is the location of the<br>
	contact. As in Figure 8a to 8b, the hyperbolic are plotted <br>
	and the point at which the largest number of hyperbolae<br>
	intersect is likely to be the true location of the contact. <br>

	pairs of sensors are requireed to determine the position of the <br>
	contact. Therefore the entire process must be performed <br>
	simultaneously for at least two pairs of sensors. Thus a<br>
	minimum number of two phase angle differences must be<br>
10 	determined. Two phase angle differences may be generated by<br>
	using two sensor and splitting the signal into two frequency<br>
	bands as described in Figure 9. Alternatively, multiple<br>
	sensors may be used so that niultiple phase angle differences<br>
	may be calculated using different pairs of sensors.<br>
