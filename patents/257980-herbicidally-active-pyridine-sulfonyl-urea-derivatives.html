(Formula Removed)<br>
in which<br>
X and Y are defined as in\the above formula (1).      Therefore, it is another object of the present invention to provide such a preparation process.<br>
The compound of formula (6) used as a starting material in the process according to the present invention can exist as an erythro isomer, threo isomer, or mixtures thereof. The stereo-chemical configuration of the desired compound of formula (1) may be determined in line with the configuration of compound (6).<br>
Any solvent which does not adversely affect the reaction can be used in the above process, but preferably tetrahydrpfuran, acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane, methylene chloride, toluene, butanol, pyridine,jdimethylformamide, etc. can be used. The above process is earned out preferably in the presence of a small amount of strong base, such as for example, triethylamine, hexamethylenetetramine, pyridine, DBU or DABCO (wherein DBU means l,8-diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene and DABCO means 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane, and they have the same meaning throughout the present specification), etc., and the reaction temperature may be preferably maintained in the range of 10 — 80'C. The specific reaction conditions can be referred to USP 4,443,245 which discusses similar reactions, and after the reaction is completed, the desired compound can be obtained through the acid-treatment procedure as described in EP 044,807. If a highly pure compound is required, it is desirable to use HPLC technique<br>
The compound of formula (7) was known and can be easily prepared according to the process described in Korean Patent No. 70,675.<br>
The compound of formula (6) is a novel intermediate which is provided first by the present invention. Therefore, it is another subject matter to be provided by the present invention. The compound of formula (6) can be prepared by treating a compound represented by the following formula (8):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which, n, R and R' are defined as formula (1), with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to eliminate the t-butyl group therefrom.<br>
If the compound of formula (8) is stirred in the solvent of trifluoroacetic acid(TFA) at 0~80°C, the t-butyl group is eliminated to give the sulfonamide compound of formula (6). When the compound of formula (6) thus obtained is present in the form of an erythro-threo mixture, it may be resolved by column chromatography, HPLC or preparative-TLC method to give pure erythro or three compound.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
The compound of formula (1) as can be prepared as explained above is more definitely exemplified individually in the following Table 1.<br><br>
[Table 1]<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compound of formula (1) according to the present invention may exist as a suitable salt and is utilizable as a herbicide in that form. The salt can be prepared by a conventional method known per se, for example, by contacting the compound of formula (1) with a solution containing hydroxide, alkoxide, or carbonate of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. Otherwise, the salt may be prepared by using an amine compound in the similar manner<br>
Various salts can also be obtained by exchanging the cation of the salt of compound of formula (1) by another one. Cation exchange is carried out by directly contacting a salt of the compound of formula (1), for example, alkali metal salt or quarternary amine salt in aqueous solution with a solution containing the cation to be<br>
newly combined. This method is the most effective when the resulting salt containing the newly combined cation is insoluble in water. Ion exchange can also be carried out by subjecting a salt of the compound of formula (1), for example, alkali metal salt or quarternary amine salt in aqueous solution to a column filled with cation exchange resin containing the cation to be newly combined. In this case, the cation in the resin is exchanged with the cation of the original salt and the desired salt newly formed is eluted from the column. This method is particularly effective when the resulting salt is water-soluble, that is, sodium, potassium or calcium salt.<br>
Further, the compound of formula (1) is conveniently used as a herbicidal agent when it is present in the form of mixtures or complexes with urea or amide compound. Those mixtures-or complexes may be prepared according to the typical methods...<br>
The preparation or conversion process as briefly summarized above may be easily carried out by a person skilled in the area of organic synthesis or synthesis of sulfonyl urea derivatives. All the processes designed from the present description by conventional modifications fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As stated already, the pyridine sulfonyl urea derivative of formula (1) according to the present invention can be used as a herbicidal agent. Therefore, the utilities and formulations are explained below.<br>

Example 19<br>
Herbicidal activities of the compounds according to the present invention and the known standard compounds as represented in the following Table 2 were estimated in a "reenhouse.<br>
[Table 2]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Test for herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy Field<br>
Pots having a surface area of 150cm2 were filled with a small amount of fertilizer and sterilized paddy field soil in a muddy state with a depth of 5cm. Five (5) seeds of pre-germinated rice were directly sown on the soil surface and three (3) rice seedlings (2~3 leaves) prepared in advance were transplanted in a depth of 2cm in each pot. In another pot, seeds of barnyardgrass were sown and incorporated into the surface layer of soil. After sowing and transplanting of rice plant and sowing of barnyardgrass, the pots were flooded with water 3cm deep and kept in a greenhouse. The rice plant was treated with the chemicals 5 days after sowing or transplanting, and barnyardgrass was treated with the chemicals at the pre-emergence (5 days after from sowing) and post-emergence stage (at the three-leaf stage, usually after 15 days from sowing).<br>
Suitable herbicidal compositions were prepared by mixing and dissolving 1 part by weight of the active compound with 5 parts by weight of acetone and 1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycolether as an emulsifier and then diluting with water to the predetermined concentration. Application was made by dropping the herbicide solutions onto the water surface of the pots.<br>
The test plants were observed for two weeks after the treatment with the chemicals and then herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the test compounds were visually rated in a percent (%) scale, where 0 means no activity or phytotoxicity and 100 means complete death.<br>
The herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity in paddy field of the compound of formula (1) and the known standard compounds are given in the following Tables 3a and 3b, respectively.<br>
Among the compounds, the standard compound E is Pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, which is the most widely used herbicide in rice at the present time. The standard compounds A,<br>
B, C and D have similar structure to the compound of formula (1) of the present invention, and were filed already.<br>
[Table 3a]<br>
Herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the standard compounds in a paddy condition.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As shown in Table 3a, the standard compound E, at 80 g/ha which is the four-times higher rate than the conventional application rate (20 g/ha), shows little phytotoxicity to rice; 10 or 30% to the transplanted or direct-seeded rice, respectively. Therefore, the compound E is considered to be highly safe to rice. However, it shows weak herbicidal activity to barnyardgrass (10% at 20g/ha), which is the most important weed in rice.<br>
On the contrary, the standard compounds A to D show excellent activity to barnyardgrass, i.e., 95% or greater activity at 20g/ha by pre- or post-emergence treatments. These compounds (A~D) also show rice safety at 20 g/ha; 10 to 40% of phytotoxicity<br>
depending on the compounds. However, for commercial development, a compound should be safe at four-times higher rates than the recommended rate. The compounds A~D show 50-80% of phytotoxicity depending on the compounds at 80g/ha, which is four times as much as the typical dose, and thus, are considered to be impossible to develop commercially.<br>
[Table 3b]<br>
Herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity of the compounds of the present invention in a paddy<br>
condition.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The compounds of the present invention have excellent herbicidal activity to barnyardgrass as well as improved rice selectivity. As shown in Table 3b, the compounds of the present invention have excellent herbicidal activity against barnyardgrass, 90% or greater depending on the compounds at 20g/ha. Further, they show acceptable rice safety at 80g/ha (30% or less), which is comparable to the standard compound E.<br>
Weed spectrum in paddv Field<br>
Pots having a surface area of 500cm2 were filled with the soil in a muddy state as mentioned above. Seeds of annual weeds such as Monochona vaginaiis (MOOVA), Lmdemia procumbens (LIDPR), Rotala mdica (ROTIN), Scirpus juncoides (SCPJU), etc. were sown on the surface layer of soil, and then were planted tubers of perennial weeds such as Cyperus serotinus (CYPSE) and Sagillaria pygmaea (SAGPY) in a depth of 1cm, and Eleocharis kuroguwai (ELOKU) and Sagiltaria Irifolia (SAGTR) in a depth of 4cm. After 5 days, the chemicals were formulated as mentioned above and applied by dropping to the water surface of the pots. The test plants were observed for two weeks after the treatment and the results are given in the following Table 4.<br>
[Table 4]<br>
Weed spectrum of the compounds of the present invention in a paddy condition.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
From the results of Table 4, the compounds of the present invention show high activities on various annual and perennial weeds in addition to barnyardgrass.<br>
Consequently, the compounds of the present invention, novel herbicidal molecules in paddy conditions, effectively .control the annual and perennial weeds including barnyardgrass by pre- and post-emergence treatment and provide a high level of safety to transplanted and direct-seeded rice. Therefore, they are expected to be used for such purposes.<br><br><br><br><br>
