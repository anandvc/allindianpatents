				<td>MENTHYL HALF ACID ESTER DERIVATIVES, PROCESSES FOR<br>
PREPARING SAME. AND USES THEREOF FOR THEIR COOLING/REFRESHING EFFECT IN CONSUMABLE MATERIALS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
Derivatives of mono menthyl esters of alkyl dioic acids including mono menthyl half acid esters and the amides thereof which provide refreshing and cooling attributes in the oral cavity, the nasal cavity and on the skin in the substantial absence of any negative taste, aroma and cooling attributes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A significant number of compounds are known to be useful in providing a cooling sensation in the mouth, in the nasal cavity and/or on skin. The best known and most widely used of these is menthol which in addition to olfaction caused a cooling response on cold receptors in the oral cavity, the nasal cavity and on skin.<br>
Since menthol has a strong minty odor, a bitter taste and provides a burning sensation when used in high concentrations, a variety of other menthyl ester-based and menthyl carboxamide-based cooling compounds have been developed, are taught in the prior art and are used in flavor or fragrance applications. Such menthyl ester-based and menthyl carboxamide-based cooling compounds include the menthyl carboxamide, N-ethyl-p-menthane carboxamide, WS-3, trademark of the Warner Lambert Company, disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,150,052, and monomenthyl succinate, monomenthyl-αα-dimethyl succinate, monomenthyl methyl succinate, monomenthyl glutarate, menthyl 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate and monomenthyl 3-methyl maleate, the uses of which are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,111,127; 5,725,865; 5,843,466; 6,365,215 and 6,451,844.<br>
More specifically, U.S. Patent 3,111,127 discloses such monomenthyl esters as monomenthyl succinate, monomenthyl aa-dimethyl succinate and monomenthyl 2-methylmaleate covered by the generic structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
wherein R represents a menthyl radical and R' is selected from the group consisting of 'saturated and unsaturated aliphatic, aromatic and heteroaromatic polycarboxylic acid radicals and substituted analogues thereof and N is the total number of carboxyl groups in the acid from which the ester is derived' for improving the flavoring characteristics when incorporated in a tobacco product. U.S. Patent 4,150,052 discloses the use of N-ethyl p-menthane-3-carboxamide for its physiological cooling action on the skin, and discloses its use in, for example, chewing gum. U.S. Patents 5,725,865 and 5,843,466 disclose the use of mono menthyl succinate for its physiological cooling action and disclose its use in, for example, carbonated beverages, alcoholic beverages and chewing gum. U.S. Patent 6,365,215 discloses at Col. 11, line 3, the use of mono menthyl glutarate in oral sensory perception-affecting compositions for use with such consumable materials as chewing gums. U.S. Patent 6,451,844 discloses the use of menthyl 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (QUEST1CE L, Quest International, B.V. of Naarden, Netherlands) having the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
in skin care and hair care compositions for their insect repellency properties.<br>
Furthermore, L-mono menthyl glutarate has been registered as a GRAS flavoring substance, FEMA No. 4006 and, in Smith et al., "GRAS Flavoring Substances 20",<br>
Food Technology, Vol. 55, No. 12. Dec. 2001 at page 53 is indicated to have uses in nonalcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, chewing gum, confectionery frosting, hard candy, soft candy and snack foods.<br>
A number of the mono menthyl half acid ester derivatives found to be useful in the practice of our invention are novel; however those that are disclosed in the prior art together with their respective syntheses, without the disclosure of utilities thereof are the compounds having the structure:<br>
 (Structure Removed) <br>
where n is an integer of from 3 up to 5, as follows:<br>
(i)        L-menthyl hydrogen adipate (n = 3);<br>
(ii)       L-menthyl hydrogen pimelate (n = 4); and<br>
(iii)      L-menthyl hydrogen suberate (n = 5)<br>
by Rule et al., "Optical Activity and the Polarity of Substituent Groups Part VIII. Growing-chain Effects and the ortho-Effect in Benzoic Esters", J.Chem.Soc. 1928 (Part I), pp. 1347-1361.<br>
In addition, a lower adjacent methylene homologue of the genus of novel compounds of our invention which genus has the structure:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br>
wherein n is an integer of from 1 to 5; wherein R is hydrogen, C1-C5 lower alkyl, 2-hydroxyethyl or cyclopropyl and wherein R' is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl is disclosed in "SciFinder" (November 20. 2002; Trademark of Chemical Abstracts Services), to wit: malonamic acid, p-menth-3-yl ester, (±)- (8C1) having CAS Registry Number 6129-88-0 where the structure is shown below:<br>
(Structure Removed) <br><br>
No indication of the use of the compound, malonamic acid, p-menth-3-yl ester, (±)- is set forth in the SciFinder disclosure.<br>
Despite the existence in the prior art and in commerce of such a vast number and variety of cooling agents including mono menthyl ester-based compounds in food, cosmetic and fragrance applications, there still remains a need for cooler compounds which provide strong and substantive refreshing and cooling attributes in the absence of negative taste, negative aroma and negative cooling attributes, and more particularly there still exists a need for cooler compounds which provide good onset of effect, prolonged cooling and economy of use.<br>

The quantity of menthyl half acid ester derivatives including menthyl half acid esters or N-alkyl alkamic acid menthyl esters utilized should be sufficient to impart the desired flavor characteristic to the product, but on the other hand, the use of an excessive amount of methyl half acid ester derivatives including menthyl half acid esters and/or<br>
N-alkyl alkamic acid menthyl esters is not only wasteful and uneconomical, but in some instances, too large a quantity may unbalance the flavor or other organoleptic properties of the product consumed. The quantity used will vary depending upon the ultimate foodstuff: the amount and type of flavor initially present in the foodstuff; the further process or treatment steps to which the foodstuff will be subjected; regional and other preference factors; the type of storage, if any. to which the product will be subjected; and the preconsumption treatment such as baking, frying and so on, given to the product by the ultimate consumer. Accordingly, the terminology effective amount and sufficient amount is understood in the context of the present invention to be quantitatively adequate to alter the flavor of the foodstuff.<br>

EXAMPLE II PREPARATION OF A CHEWING GUM<br>
100 parts by weight of chicle were mixed with 4 parts by weight of a fruity citrus gum flavor which was a blend of lemon oil. ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate, benzaldehyde, citral and alpha ionone in equal portions. To the resulting mixture, 300 parts by weight of sucrose and 100 parts by weight of corn syrup were added. Mixing was effected in a ribbon blender with jacketed sidewalls, manufactured by Baker Perkins Co. The resultant chewing gum blend was then manufactured into strips 1 inch in width and 0.1 inches in thickness. These strips were cut into lengths of 3 inches each. This control gum exhibited a fruity lemon flavor without imparting any cooling effect. A second gum sample was prepared using the above recipe with the addition of 1 part by weight of menthyl N,N-dimethyl succinamide, prepared according to Example 1(C). The resulting gum had a taste profile substantially identical to the taste profile of the control gum, however the sweetness of the flavor was enhanced and the gum exhibited a pleasant and substantive cooling effect on the tongue and roof of the mouth.<br>
EXAMPLE 111 PREPARATION OF HARD CANDY<br>
The following formulation was prepared:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The above formulation was added to a stainless steel pot. With constant mixing, the formulation temperature was raised to 295°F. The pot was then removed from the heat, and 0.3 grams of cherry flavor containing the ingredients in equal amounts benzaldehyde,<br>
tolyl aldehyde, ethyl acetate, maltol, Davana oil and methyl heptinyl carbonate and 1.2 grams of citric acid was added. The resulting liquid candy was then deposited into molds, and the molds containing the liquid candy were cooled to room temperature, yielding 200 grams of finished hard candy. The resulting control candy exhibited a green, candied cherry type of flavor without exhibiting any cooling effect. A second candy sample was prepared using the above recipe modified by the addition of 0.2 grams of menthyl succinamide prepared according to the procedure of Example I (A). This second candy sample exhibited a moderately strong and substantive cooling effect, a very slight bitterness and a flavor profile which was substantially identical to the flavor profile of the control sample.<br>
