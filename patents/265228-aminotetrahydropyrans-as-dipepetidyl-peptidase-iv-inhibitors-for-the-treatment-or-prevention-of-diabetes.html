				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
AMINOTETRAHYDROPYRANS AS DIPEPTIDYL PEPTIDASE-IV INHIBITORS FOR THE<br>
TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF DIABETES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted aminotetrahydropyrans which are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme ("DPP-4 inhibitors") and which are useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is involved, such as diabetes and particularly Type 2 diabetes. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme is involved.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose or hyperglycemia in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with increased and premature morbidity and mortality. Often abnormal glucose homeostasis is associated both directly and indirectly with alterations of the lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein metabolism and other metabolic and hemodynamic disease. Therefore patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus are at especially increased risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications, including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Therefore, therapeutical control of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism and hypertension are critically important in the clinical management and treatment of diabetes mellitus.<br>
There are two generally recognized forms of diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (EDDM), patients produce little or no insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. In Type 2 diabetes, or noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NBDDM), patients often have plasma insulin levels that are the same or even elevated compared to nondiabetic subjects; however, these patients have developed a resistance to the insulin stimulating effect on glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues, which are muscle, liver and adipose tissues, and the plasma insulin levels, while elevated, are insufficient to overcome the pronounced insulin resistance.<br>
Insulin resistance is not primarily due to a diminished number of insulin receptors but to a post-insulin receptor binding defect that is not yet understood. This resistance to insulin responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake, oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in the liver.<br>
The available treatments for Type 2 diabetes, which have not changed substantially in many years, have recognized limitations. While physical exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very poor<br><br>
because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food consumption, especially of foods containing high amounts of saturated fat. Increasing the plasma level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide, which stimulate the pancreatic )S cells to secrete more insulin, and/or by injection of insulin when sulfonylureas or meglitinide become ineffective, can result in insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate the very insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma glucose can result from administration of insulin or insulin secretagogues (sulfonylureas or meglitinide), and an increased level of insulin resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels can occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguanides, phenfonnm and metformin, can induce lactic acidosis and nausea/diarrhea. Metformin has fewer side effects than phenformin and is often prescribed for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.<br>
The glitazones (i.e. 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a more recently described class of compounds with potential for ameliorating many symptoms of Type 2 diabetes. These agents substantially increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in several animal models of Type 2 diabetes resulting in partial or complete correction of the elevated plasma levels of glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. The glilBZones that are currently marketed are agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), primarily the PPAR-gamma subtype. PPAR-gamma agonism is generally believed to be responsible for the improved insulin sensititization that is observed with the glitazones. Newer PPAR agonists that are being tested for treatment of Type II diabetes are agonists of the alpha, gamma or delta subtype, or a combination of these, and in many cases are chemically different from the glitazones (i.e., they are not thiazolidinediones). Serious side effects (e.g. liver toxicity) have occurred with some of the glitazones, such as troglitazone.<br>
Additional methods of treating the disease are still under investigation. New biochemical approaches that have been recently introduced or are still under development include Ireatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g. acarbose) and protein tyrosine phosphatase-! B (PTP-IB) inhibitors.<br>
Compounds that are inhibitors of the dipeptidyl peptidase-FV ("DPP-4") enzyme are also mder investigation as drugs that may be useful in the treatment of diabetes, and particularly Type 2 iiabetes. See WO 97/40832; WO 98/19998; U.S. Patent No. 5,939,560; U.S. Patent No. 6,303,661; U.S. i'atentNo. 6,699,871; U.S. Patent No. 6,166,063; Bioore. Med. Chem. Lett.. 6:1163-1166 (1996); Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 6: 2745-2748 (1996); Ann E. Weber, J. Med. Chem.. 47: 4135-4141 (2004); ). Kim, et al., J. Med. Chem.. 48:141-151 (2005); and K. Augustyns, Exp. Opin. Then Patents. 15: [387-1407 (2005). The usefulness of DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is based on he fact that DPP-4 in vivo readily inactivates glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory leptide (GIP). GLP-1 and GIP are incretins and are produced when food is consumed. The incretins timulate production of insulin. Inhibition of DPP-4 leads to decreased inactivation of the incretins, and [lis in turn results in increased effectiveness of the incretins in stimulating production of insulin by the lancreas. DPP-4 inhibition therefore results in an increased level of serum insulin. Advantageonsly<br><br>
since the incretins are produced by the body only when food is consumed, DPP-4 inhibition is not expected to increase the level of insulin at inappropriate times, such as between meals, which can lead to excessively low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Inhibition of DPP-4 is therefore expected to increase insulin without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous side effect associated with the use of insulin secretagogues.<br>
DPP-4 inhibitors also have other therapeutic utilities, as discussed herein. DPP-4 inhibitors have not been studied extensively to date, especially for utilities other than diabetes. New compounds are needed so that inqjroved DPP-4 inhibitors can be found for the treatment of diabetes and potentially other diseases and conditions. In particular, there is a need for DPP-4 inhibitors that are selective over other members of the family of serine peptidases that includes quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), DPP8, and DPP9 (see G. Lankas, et al., "Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV Inhibition for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes," Diabetes. 54: 2988-2994 (2005). The therapeutic potential of DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes is discussed by D.J. Dnioker in Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 12: 87-100 (2003); by K. Augustyns, et al., in Exp. Opin.

In particular the compounds of the present invention have an asymmetric center at the stereogenio carbon atoms marked with an * in formulae la, lb, Ic, Id, le, and If. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and imless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention. An example of tautomers which are intended to be encompassed within the compounds of the present invention is illustrated below:<br><br>
Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. Formulae la and lb show the preferred stereochemistry at the stereogenic carbon atoms to which are attached the NH2 and Ar groups on the tetrahydropyran ring. Formulae Ic and Id show the preferred stereochemistry at the stereogenic carbon atoms to which are attached the NH2, Ar, and V groups on the tetrahydropyran ring.<br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or<br><br>
crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
If desired, raceraic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition constants are determined as follows. A continuous fluorometric assay is employed with the substrate Gly-Pro-AMC, which is cleaved by DPP-4 to release the fluorescent AMC leaiving group. The kinetic parameters that describe this reaction are as follows: Km = 50 nM; kcat = 75 s'; kcai/Km = 1.5 x lO' M"' s'.  A typical reaction contains approximately 50 pM enzyme, 50 |xM Gly-Pro-AMC, and buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) in a total reaction volume of 100 fil. Liberation of AMC is monitored continuously in a 96-well plate fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission waveleng;th of 460 nm. Under these conditions, approximately 0.8 pM AMC is produced in 30 minutes at 25 degrees C. The enzyme used in these studies was soluble (transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic extension excluded) human protein produced in a baculovirus expression system (Bac-To-Bac, Gibco BRL). The kinetic constants for hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-AMC and GLP-1 were foxmd to be in accord with literature values for the native enzyme. To measure the dissociation constants for compounds, solutions of inhibitor in DMSO were added to reactions containing enzyme and substrate (final DMSO concentration is 1%). All experiments were conducted at room temperature using the standard reaction conditions described above. To determine the dissociation constants (Ki)&gt; reaction rates were fit by non-linear regression to the Michaelis-Menton equation for competitive inhibition. The errors in reproducing the dissociation constants are typically less than two-fold.<br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV en^one in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC50 of less than about 1<br>
^M. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme activity.<br><br>
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV enzyme (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein that has been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. It has a broad tissue distribution (intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, placenta, thymus, spleen, epithelial cells, vascular endothelium, lymphoid and myeloid cells, serum), and distinct tissue and cell-type expression levels. DPP-4 is identical to the T cell activation marker CD26, and it can cleave a number of immunoregulatory, endocrine, and neurological peptides in vitro. This has suggested a potential role for this peptidase in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species.<br>
Accordingly, the subject compounds are useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of the following diseases, disorders and conditions.<br>
Type n Diabetes and Related Disorders: It is well established that the incretins GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated in vivo by DPP-4. Studies with DPP-4^'"^-defioient mice and preliminary clinical trials indicate that DPP-4 inhibition increases the steady state concentrations of GLP-1 and GIP, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. By analogy to GLP-1 and GIP, it is likely that other glucagon family peptides involved in glucose regulation are also inactivated by DPP-4 (eg. PACAP).  Inactivation of these peptides by DPP-4 may also play a role in glucose homeostasis. The DPP-4 inhibitors of the present invention therefore have utility in the treatment of type II diabetes and in the treatment and prevention of the numerous conditions that often accompany Type n diabetes, including Syndrome X (also known as Metabolic Syndrome), reactive hypoglycemia, and diabetic dyslipidemia. Obesity, discussed below, is another condition that is often foimd with Type 11 diabetes that may respond to treatment with the compoimds of this invention.<br>
The following diseases, disorders and conditions are related to Type 2 diabetes, and therefore may be treated, controlled or in some cases prevented, by treatment with the compounds of this invention: (1) hyperglycemia, (2) low glucose tolerance, (3) insulin resistance, (4) obesity, (5) lipid disorders, (6) dyslipidemia, (7) hyperlipidemia, (8) hypertriglyceridemia, (9) hypercholesterolemia, (10) low HDL levels, (11) high LDL levels, (12) atherosclerosis and its sequelae, (13) vascular restenosis, (14) irritable bowel syndrome, (15) inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, (16) other inflammatory conditions, (17) pancreatitis, (18) abdominal obesity, (19) neurodegenerative disease, (20) retinopathy, (21) nephropathy, (22) neuropathy, (23) Syndrome X, (24) ovarian hyperandrogenism (polycystic ovarian syndrome), and other disorders where insulin resistance is a component. In Syndrome X, also known as Metabolic Syndrome, obesity is thought to promote insulin I     resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and increased cardiovascular risk. Therefore, DPP-4 inhibitors may also be useful to treat hypertension associated with this condition. Obesity: DPP-4 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of obesity. This is based on the observed inhibitory effects on food intake and gastric emptying of GLP-1 and GLP-2. Exogenous administration of GLP-1 in humans significantly decreases food intake and slows gastric emptying (Am. J. Physiol., )      277: R910-R916(1999)). ICV administration of GLP-1 in rats and mice also has profound effects on food intake ^Nature Medicine. 2: 1254-1258 (1996)). This inhibition of feeding is not observed in GLP-IR*"'"' mice, indicating that these effects are mediated through brain GLP-1 receptors. By analogy to GLP-1, it is likely that GLP-2 is also regulated by DPP-4. ICV administration of GLP-2 also inhibits<br><br>
food intake, analogous to the effects observed with GLP-1 fNature Medicine. 6: 802-807 (2000)). In addition, studies with DPP-4 deficient mice suggest that these animals are resistant to diet-induced obesity and associated pathology (e.g. hyperinsulinonemia).<br>
Cardiovascular Disease: GLP-1 has been shown to be beneficial when administered to patients following 5      acute myocardial infarction, leading to improved left ventricular function and reduced mortality after primary angioplasty (Circulation, 109: 962-965 (2004)). GLP-1 administration is also useful for the treatment of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic induced left ventricular dysfunction, and thus may prove useful for the treatment of patients with heart failure (US2004/0097411). DPP-4 inhibitors are expected to show similar effects through their ability to stabilize endogenous GLP-1.<br>
Growth Hormone Deficiency: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency, based on the hypothesis that growth-hormone releasing factor (GRF), a peptide that stimulates release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary, is cleaved by the DPP-4 enzyme in vivo (WO 00/56297). The following data provide evidence that GRF is an endogenous substrate: (1) GRF is efficiently cleaved in vitro to generate the inactive product GRF[3-44] (BBA 1122: 147-153 (1992)); (2) GRF is rapidly degraded in plasma to GRF[3-44]; this is prevented by the DPP-4 inhibitor diprotin A; and (3) GRF[3-44] is found in the plasma of a human GRF transgenic pig fJ. Clin. Invest.. 83: 1533-1540 (1989)). Thus DPP-4 inhibitors may be useful for the same spectrum of indications which have been considered for grovi'th hormone secretagogues.<br>
Intestinal hiiurv: The potential for using DPP-4 inhibitors for the treatment of intestinal injury is suggested by the results of studies indicating that glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), a likely endogenous substrate for DPP-4, may exhibit trophic effects on fee intestinal epithelium fReeulatorv Peptides. 90: 27-32 (2000)). Administration of GLP-2 results in increased small bowel mass in rodents and attenuates intestinal injury in rodent models of colitis and enteritis.<br>
Immunosuppression: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for modulation of the immune response, based upon studies implicating the DPP-4 enzyme in T cell activation and in chemokine processing, and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in In vivo models of disease. DPP-4 has been shown to be identical to CD26, a cell surface marker for activated immune cells. The expression of CD26 is regulated by the differentiation and activation status of immune cells. It is generally accepted that CD26 fiinctions as a co-stimulatory molecule in in vitro models of T cell activation. A number of chemokines contain proline in the penultimate position, presumably to protect them fi-om degradation by non-specific aminopeptidases. Many of these have been shown to be processed in vitro by DPP-4. In several cases (ElANTES, LD78-beta, MDC, eotaxin, SDF-lalpha), cleavage results in an altered activity in chemotaxis and signaling assays.  Receptor selectivity also appears to be modified in some cases (RANTES). Multiple N-terminally truncated forms of a number of chemokines have been identified in in vitro cell culture systems, including the predicted products of DPP-4 hydrolysis.<br>
DPP-4 inhibitors have been shown to be efficacious immxmosuppressants in animal models of transplantation and arthritis. Prodipine (Pro-Pro-diphenyl-phosphonate), an irreversible<br><br>
inhibitor of DPP-4, was shown to double cardiac allograft survival in rats from day 7 to day 14 (Transplantation. 63: 1495-1500 (1997)). DPP-4 inhibitors have been tested in collagen and alkyldiamijie-induced arthritis in rats and showed a statistically significant attenuation of hind paw swelling in this model fint. J. Immunopharmacolopv. 19:15-24 (1997) and Immunophannacolo|gv. 40: 21-26 (1998)]. DPP-4 is upregulated in a number of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Graves* disease, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis flmmunologv Today, 20: 367-375 (1999)).<br>
HIV Infection: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of HTV infection or AIDS because a number of chemokines which inhibit HTV cell entry are potential substrates for DPP-4 (Immunology Today 20: 367-375 (1999)). In the case of SDF-lalpha, cleavage decreases antiviral activity (PNAS. 95: 6331-6 (1998)). Thus, stabilization of SDF-lalpha ttirough inhibition of DPP-4 would be expected to decrease HIV infectivity.<br>
Hematopoiesis: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment or prevention of hematopiesis because DPP-4 may be involved in hematopoiesis. A DPP-4 inhibitor, Val-Boro-Pro, stimulated hematopoiesis in a mouse model of cyclophosphamdde-induced neutropenia (WO 99/56753).<br>
Neuronal Disorders: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment or preyention of various neuronal or psychiatric disorders because a number of peptides implicated in a variety of neuronal processes are cleaved in vitro by DPP-4. A DPP-4 inhibitor thus may have a Iherapeutic benefit in the treatment of neuronal disorders. Endomorphin-2, beta-casonM&gt;rphin, and substance P have all been shown to be in vitro substrates for DPP-4. In all cases, in vitro cleavage is highly efficient, v^th kcat/Km about 10* M"'s' or greater. In an electric shock jump test model of analgesia in rats, a DPP-4 inhibitor showed a significant effect that was independent of the presence of exogenous endomorphin-2 fBrain Research. 815: 278-286 (1999)). Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of DPP-4 inhibitors were also evidenced by the inhibitors' ability to protect motor neurons from excitotoxic cell death, to protect striatal innervation of dopaminergic neurons when administered concurrently with MPTP, and to promote recovery of striatal innervation density when given in a therapeutic manner following MPTP treatment [see Yong-Q. Wu, et al., "Neuroprotective Effects of Inhibitors of Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV In Vitro and In Vivo," Int. Conf. On pipeptidvl Aminopeptidases: Basic Science and Clinical Applications. September 26-29,2002 (Berlin, Germany)].<br>
Anxiety: Rats naturally deficient in DPP-4 have an anxiolytic phenotype (WO 02/34243; Karl et al, Phvsiol. Behav. 2003). DPP-4 deficient mice also have an anxiolytic phenotype using the porsolt and light/dark models. Thus DPP-4 inhibitors may prove useful for treating anxiety and related disorders. Memory and Coalition: GLP-1 agonists are active in models of learning (passive avoidance, Morris water maze) and neuronal injury (kainate-induced neuronal apoptosis) as demonstrated by During et al. fNature Med. 9: 1173-1179 (2003)). The results suggest a physiological role for GLP-1 in learning and neuroprotection. Stabilization of GLP-1 by DPP-4 inhibitors are expected to show similar effects<br><br>
Myocardial Infarction: GLP-1 has been shown to be beneficial when administered to patients following<br>
acute myocardial infarction (Circulation, 109: 962-965 (2004)). DPP-4 inhibitors are expected to show<br>
similar effects through their ability to stabilize endogenous GLP-1.<br>
Tumor Invasion and Metastasis: DPP-4 inhibition may be. useful for the treatment or prevention of tumor<br>
invasion and metastasis because an increase or decrease in expression of several ectopeptidases including<br>
DPP-4 has been observed during the transformation of normal cells to a malignant phenotype f J. Exp.<br>
Med.. 190: 301-305 (1999)). Up- or down-regulation of these proteins appears to be tissue and cell-type<br>
specific. For example, increased CD26/DPP-4 expression has been observed on T cell lymphoma, T cell<br>
acute 13'mphoblastic leukemia, cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, and breast<br>
carcinomas. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors may have utility in the treatment of such carcinomas.<br>
Beniien Prostatic Hvpertronhv: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment of benign prostatic<br>
hypertrophy because increased DPP-4 activity was noted in prostate tissue from patients with BPH CEur.<br>
J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem.. 30: 333-338 (1992)).<br>
Sperm motilitv/male contraception: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the altering sperm motility and<br>
for male contraception because in seminal fluid, prostatosomes, prostate derived organelles important for<br>
sperm motility, possess very high levels of DPP-4 activity fEur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem.. 30:333-<br>
338 (1992)).<br>
Gingivitis: DPP-4 inhibition may be useful for the treatment of gingivitis because DPP-4 activity was<br>
found in gingival crevicular fluid and in some studies correlated with periodontal disease severity (Arch.<br>
Oral Biol.. 37: 167-173(1992)).<br>
Osteoporosis: DPP-4 inhibition may be usefiil for the treatment or prevention of osteoporosis because<br>
GIP receptors are present in osteoblasts.<br>
Stem Cell Transplantation: Inhibition of DPP-4 on donor stem cells has been shown to lead to an<br>
enhancement of their bone marrow homing efficiency and engraftment, and an increase in survival in<br>
mice (Christopherson, et al.. Science. 305:1000-1003 (2004)). Thus DPP-4 inhibitors may be useful in<br>
bone marrow transplantation.<br>

The subject compounds are further useful in a method for the prevention or treatment of the aforementioned diseases, disorders and conditions in combination with other agents.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, suppression or ameh'oration of diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of Formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy may also include therapies in which the confound of Formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemqjlated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of Formula I.<br>

one. or more preservatives, for example ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.

In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require inhibition of dipeptidyl pcptidase-IV enzyme activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 250 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5,0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 mg of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0,15.0.20.0,25.0, 50.0,75.0, 100.0,150.0, 200.0,250.0. 300.0,400.0, 500.0,600.0,750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 mg of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.<br>
When treating or preventing diabetes mellitus and/or hyperglycemia or hypertriglyceridemia or other diseases for which compoimds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactoiy results are obtained when the conpounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 mg to about 1000 mg, preferably from ' about 1 mg to about 50 mg. Jn the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 mg to about 350 mg. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br>
Synthetic methods for preparing tiie compounds of the present invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are commercially available or may be made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from intermediates such as those of formula n and m using standard reductive amination conditions followed by deprotection.<br><br><br>
Intermediates of formula n are known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One common route is illustrated in Scheme 1, Substituted benzoyl halide 1 is treated with phenol in the presence of a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine to form the ester 2. Treatment of 2 with the anion generated from nitromethane using sodium hydride gives the nitroketone 2.- Alternatively, the nitroketone 3. can be made by reacting aldehyde la with nitromethane in the presence of a base and oxidizing the resulting nitroalcohol lb with<br><br>
an oxidizing agent such as Jones reagent. Heating the nitroketone 3 with 3-iodo-2-(iodomethyl)prop-l-ene gives the pyran 4, which, when reduced with sodiunL borohydride and isomerized with a base such as l,8-dia2abicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), provides the trans pyran 5. The enantiomers of 5. may be separated at this stage by a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. Conveniently, the racemate may be resolved by HPLC using a chiral column. The nitro-substituted pyran 5 is then reduced, for example, using zinc and an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, and the resulting amine 6 protected, for example, as its BOC derivative, by treatment with di-terr-butyl dioarbonate to give 7. Treatment of 7 with osmium tetroxide and ^-methylmorpholine ^-oxide forms the diol 8 which upon treatment with sodium periodate gives intermediate pyranone Ha.<br><br>
Intermediates of formula in are known in the literature or may be conveniently prepared by a variety of methods familiar to those skilled in the art. One common route to prepare tetrahydropyrrolopyrazole lEa is illustrated in Scheme 2. Trityl- or Boc-protected pyrrolidinol £ may be oxidized by a variety of methods, such as the Swem procedure, commonly known to those in the art, to give the ketone 10, which upon treatment and heating with M/Z-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMF-DMA) gives H.. The desired intermediate Ilia may flien be readily obtained by heating a solution of 11 with hydrazine 12 in a suitable solvent such as ethanol optionally in the presence of a base such as sodium ethoxide followed by removal of the protecting group with acid.<br><br><br>
As illustrated in Scheme 3, the compounds of the present invention structural formula (I) may be prepared by reductive amination of Intermediate II in tiie presence of Intennediate IE using reagents such as sodium cyanoborohydride, decaborane, or sodium triacetoxyborohydride in solvents such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, or methanol to provide Intermediate IV. The reaction is conducted optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid such as titanium tetrachloride or titanium tetraisopropoxide. The reaction may also be facilitated by adding an acid such as acetic acid. In some cases. Intermediate ni may be a salt, such as a hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid salt, and in these cases it is convenient to add a base, generally JViiV-diisopropylethylamine, to the reaction mixture. The protecting group is then removed with, for example, trifluoroacetic acid or methanolic hydrogen chloride in the case of Boo, or palladium-on-carbon and hydrogen gas in the case of Cbz to give the desired amine I. The product is purified, if necessary, by reciystallization, trituration, preparative thin layer chromatography, flash chromatography on silica gel, such as with a Biotage® apparatus, or HPLC. Compounds that are purified by HPLC maybe isolated as the corresponding salt.<br>
In some cases the product I or synthetic intermediates illustrated in the above schemes may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents on Ar or V. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions that are commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In some cases the order of carrying out the foregoing reaction schemes may be varied to facilitate the reaction or to avoid unwanted reaction products. The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood. These examples are illustrative only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br><br>
