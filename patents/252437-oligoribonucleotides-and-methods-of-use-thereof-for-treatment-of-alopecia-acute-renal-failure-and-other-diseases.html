OLIGORIBONUCLEOTIDES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF FOR TREATMENT OF ALOPECIA, ACUTE RENAL FAILURE AND OTHER DISEASES.<br>
Throughout this application various patent and scientific publications are cited. The disclosures for these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
siRNAs and RNA interference<br>
RNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon involving double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent gene specific posttranscriptional silencing. Originally, attempts to study this phenomenon and to manipulate mammalian cells experimentally were frustrated by an active, non-specific antiviral defense mechanism which was activated in response to long dsRNA molecules; see Gil et al. 2000, Apoptosis, 5:107-114. Later it was discovered that synthetic duplexes of 21 nucleotide RNAs could mediate gene specific RNAi in mammalian cells, without the stimulation of the generic antiviral defence mechanisms (see Elbashir et al. Nature 2001, 411:494-498 and Caplen et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 2001, 98:9742-9747). As a result, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are short double-stranded RNAs, have become powerful tools in attempting to understand gene function.<br>
Thus, RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the process of sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing in mammals mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al, 1998, Nature 391., 806) or microRNAs (miRNAs) (Ambros V. Nature 431:7006,350-355(2004); and Bartel DP. Cell. 2004 Jan 23; 116(2): 281-97 MicroRNAs: genomics, biogenesis, mechanism, and function). The corresponding process in plants is commonly referred to as specific post-transcriptional gene silencing or RNA silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. An siRNA is a double-stranded RNA molecule which down-regulates or silences (prevents) the expression of a gene/ mRNA of its endogenous (cellular) counterpart. RNA interference is based on the ability of dsRNA species to enter a specific protein complex, where it is then targeted to the complementary cellular RNA and specifically degrades it. Thus, the RNA interference response features an endonuclease<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
complex containing an siRNA, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having a sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA may take place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al 2001, Genes Dev., 15, 188). In more detail, longer dsRNAs are digested into short (17-29 bp) dsRNA fragments (also referred to as short inhibitory RNAs - "siRNAs") by type III RNAses (DICER, DROSHA, etc., Bernstein et al., Nature, 2001, v.409, p.363-6; Lee et al., Nature, 2003, 425, p.415-9). The RISC protein complex recognizes these fragments and complementary mRNA. The whole process is culminated by endonuclease cleavage of target mRNA (McManus&amp;Sharp, Nature Rev Genet, 2002, v.3, p.737-47; Paddison &amp;Hannon, Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2003 Jun; 5(3): 217-24).

Several groups have described the development of DNA-based vectors capable of generating siRNA within cells. The method generally involves transcription of short hairpin RNAs that are efficiently processed to form siRNAs within cells. Paddison et al. PNAS 2002, 99:1443-<br>

siRNA has recently been successfully used for inhibition in primates; for further details see Tolentino et al., Retina 24(1) February 2004 1132-138.<br>
The p53 gene and polypeptide<br>
The human p53 gene is a well-known and highly studied gene. The p53 polypeptide plays a key role in cellular stress response mechanisms by converting a variety of different stimuli, for example DNA damaging conditions, such as gamma-irradiation, deregulation of transcription or replication, and oncogene transformation, into cell growth arrest or apoptosis (Gottlieb et al,1996, Biochem.Biophys. Acta, 1287. p.77). The p53 polypeptide is essential for the induction of programmed cell death or "apoptosis" as a response to such stimuli. Most anti-cancer therapies damage or kill also normal cells that contain native p53, causing severe side effects associated with the damage or death of healthy cells. Since such side effects are to a great extent determined by p53-mediated death of normal cells, the temporary suppression of p53 during the acute phase of anti-cancer therapy has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to avoid these severe toxic events. This was described in US Patent No. 6,593,353 and in Komarov PG et al , 1999, A chemical inhibitor ofp53 that protects mice from the side effects of cancer therapy., Science , 285(5434): 1651, 1653. p53 has been shown to be involved in chemotherapy and radiation-induced alopecia. (Botcharev et al, 2000, p53 is essential for Chemotherapy -induced Hair Loss, Cancer Research, 60, 5002-5006).<br>
Alopecia<br>
Recently there have been dramatic advances in the understanding of the molecules and pathways regulating hair follicle formation and hair growth. Chemotherapy disrupts the proliferation of matrix keratinocytes in the growth bulb that produce the hair shaft. This forces hair follicles to enter a dystrophic regression stage in which the integrity of the hair shaft is compromised and the hair then breaks and falls out. Because more than 90% of scalp follicles are in growth stage at any one time, these hairs are rapidly lost after chemotherapy, and thus the alopecia is rapid and extensive (George Cotsarelis and Sarah E. Millar,<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
2001,Towards a molecular understanding of hair loss and its treatment, TRENDS in Molecular Medicine Vol.7 No.7). Chemotherapy drugs most likely to cause hair loss are: Cisplatinum, Cytarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, Etoposide, Ifosfamide and Vincristine. Radiation induced general alopecia is observed in virtually 100% of patients who receive whole brain radiation (WBR), particularly of 3000 rad and above.<br>
Hair loss is one of the most feared side effects of chemotherapy among patients with cancer, even although hair lost following chemotherapy does eventually re-grow. From the patient's perspective, hair loss (alopecia) ranks second only to nausea as a distressing side effect of chemotherapy. About 75% of patients describe chemotherapy induced hair loss as equal to or more devastating than the pain caused by cancer.<br>
Thus, although hair disorders are not life threatening, their profound impact on social interactions and on the psychological well-being of patients is undeniable. The demand for treatments for hair loss fuels a multi-billion dollar industry. Despite this, most currently marketed products are ineffective, evidenced by the fact that the FDA has approved only two treatments for hair loss. None of the known therapies or remedies is effective on cancer therapy-induced alopecia.<br>
Acute renal failure (ARF).<br>
ARF is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function that occurs within days. The principal feature of ARF is an abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the retention of nitrogenous wastes (urea, creatinine). In the general world population 170-200 cases of severe ARF per million population occur annually. To date, there is no specific treatment for established ARF. Several drugs have been found to ameliorate toxic and ischemic experimental ARF, as manifested by lower serum creatinine levels, reduced histological damage and faster recovery of renal function in different animal models. These include anti-oxidants, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, vasoactive substances, growth factors, anti-inflammatory agents and more. However, those drugs that have been studied in clinical trials showed no benefit, and their use in clinical ARF has not been approved.<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
In the majority of hospitalized patients, ARF is caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which results from ischemic and/or nephrotoxic insults. Renal hypoperfusion is caused by hypovolemic, cardiogenic and septic shock, by administration of vasoconstrictive drugs or renovascular injury. Nephrotoxins include exogenous toxins such as contrast media and aminoglycosides as well as endogenous toxin such as myoglobin. Recent studies, however, support that apoptosis in renal tissues is prominent in most human cases of ARF. The principal site of apoptotic cell death is the distal nephron. During the initial phase of ischemic injury, loss of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton leads to flattening of the epithelium, with loss of the brush border, loss of focal cell contacts, and subsequent disengagement of the cell from the underlying substratum. It has been suggested that apoptotic tubule cell death may be more predictive of functional changes than necrotic cell death (Komarov et al. Science. 1999 Sep 10;285(5434): 1733-7); see also (Supavekin et al. Kidney Int. 2003 May;63(5): 1714-24).<br>
In conclusion, currently there are no satisfactory modes of therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of toxic alopecia and of acute renal failure, nor are there a satisfactory mode of therapy for many other diseases and disorders which are accompanied by an elevated level of p53 polypeptide, and there is a need therefore to develop novel compounds for this purpose.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides novel double stranded oligoribonucleotides that inhibit the p53 gene. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more such oligoribonucleotides, and a vector capable of expressing the oligoribonucleotide. The present invention also provides a method of treating a patient suffering from a disease in which temporary (reversible) inhibition of p53 activity is beneficial comprising administering to the patient one or more oligoribonucleotides typically as a pharmaceutical composition, in a therapeutically effective dose so as to thereby treat the patient. The present invention also contemplates treating other disorders which are accompanied by an elevated level of p53 polypeptide. Since long-term p53 inactivation can significantly increase the risk of cancer, it is preferred that the inhibition of p53 using the molecules of the present invention will be temporary.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the novel siRNA molecules disclosed herein may be used in the treatment of tumors in cases where temporary suppression of p53 using the p53 siRNA would be beneficial along with convential chemotherapy (as described herein) or radiotherapy. For example, the novel siRNA molecules disclosed herein would protect normal p53-containing cells from chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced apoptosis. The novel siRNA molecules disclosed herein may also be used for inhibition of p53 expression in specific cancer cells in cases where p53 inhibition potentiates apoptotic cell death in these cells. Specifically, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may cause severe side effects, such as severe damage to the lymphoid and hematopoietic system and intestinal epithelia, which limit the effectiveness of these therapies, and may cause hair loss which causes psychological distress. These side effects are caused by p53-mediated apoptosis. Therefore, to eliminate or reduce adverse side effects associated with cancer treatment, it would be beneficial to induce temporary inhibition of p53 activity in normal cells using the siRNA molecules of the present invention, thereby protecting normal tissue.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the novel siRNA molecules disclosed herein may be used in the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF), which is characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function associated with apoptotic cell death in the renal tissue.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
The novel siRNA molecules disclosed herein may also be used in other conditions in which p53 is activated as a consequence of a variety of stresses associated with injuries such as a burn, hyperthermia, hypoxia associated with a blocked blood supply such as in myocardial infraction, stroke, and ischemia. Temporary p53 inhibition using the siRNA molecules of the present invention can be therapeutically effective in reducing or eliminating p53-dependent neuronal death in the central nervous system, i.e., brain and spinal cord injury, the preservation of tissues and organs prior to transplanting, preparation of a host for a bone marrow transplant, and reducing or eliminating neuronal damage during a seizure.<br>
p53 also plays a role in cell aging. In particular, morphological and physiological alterations of normal tissues associated with aging may be related to p53 activity. Senescent cells that accumulate in tissues over time are known to maintain very high levels of p53-dependent transcription. p53-dependent secretion of growth inhibitors by senescent cells accumulate in aging tissue. Thus, the siRNA molecules disclosed herein may also be used in suppression of tissue aging.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to compounds which down-regulate expression of the p53 gene particularly to novel small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and to the use of these novel siRNAs in the treatment of various diseases and medical conditions in particular alopecia or acute renal failure or a disorder accompanied by an elevated level of p53 polypeptide. The inventors of the present invention have found that it is beneficial to induce temporary inhibition of p53 in order to treat any of said diseases or disorders. Methods, molecules and compositions which inhibit p53 are discussed herein at length, and any of said molecules and/or compositions may be beneficially employed in the treatment of a patient suffering from any of said conditions.<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting expression of a target p53 gene in vivo. In general, the method includes administering oligoribonucleotides, such as small interfering RNAs (i.e., siRNAs) that are targeted to a particular p53 mRNA and hybridize to, or interact with, the mRNAs under biological conditions (within the cell), or a nucleic acid material that can produce siRNA in a cell, in an amount sufficient to down-regulate expression of a target gene by an RNA interference mechanism. In particular, the subject method can be used to inhibit expression of the p53 gene for treatment of a disease.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the siRNA molecules or inhibitors of the p53 gene may be used as drugs to treat various pathologies in particular alopecia or acute renal failure or other disorders accompanied by an elevated level of p53 polypeptide. Since long-term p53 inactivation can significantly increase the risk of cancer, it is preferred that the inhibition of p53 using the molecules of the present invention be temporary / reversible.<br>

WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
The present invention provides double-stranded oligoribonucleotides (siRNAs), which down-regulate the expression of the p53 gene. An siRNA of the invention is a duplex oligoribonucleotide in which the sense strand is derived from the mRNA sequence of the p53 gene, and the antisense strand is complementary to the sense strand. In general, some deviation from the target mRNA sequence is tolerated without compromising the siRNA activity (see e.g. Czauderna et al 2003 Nucleic Acids Research 31.(11), 2705-2716). An siRNA of the invention inhibits gene expression on a post-transcriptional level with or without destroying the mRNA. Without being bound by theory, siRNA may target the mRNA for specific cleavage and degradation and/ or may inhibit translation from the targeted message.<br>
There are at least four variant p53 polypeptides (see Bourdon et al. Genes Dev..2005; 19: 2122-2137). The sequence given in Figure 1 is the nucleotide sequence of gi-8400737. The corresponding polypeptide sequence has 393 amino acids; see Figure 2. All variants and any other similar minor variants are included in the definition of p53 polypeptide and in the definition of the p53 genes encoding them.<br>
As used herein, the term "p53 gene" is defined as any homolog of the p53 gene having preferably 90% homology, more preferably 95% homology, and even more preferably 98% homology to the amino acid encoding region of SEQ ID NO:1 or nucleic acid sequences which bind to the p53 gene under conditions of highly stringent hybridization, which are well-known in the art (for example, see Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland (1988), updated in 1995 and 1998.<br>
As used herein, the term "p53", or "p53 polypeptide" is defined as any homolog of the p53 polypeptide having preferably 90% homology, more preferably 95% homology, and even more preferably 98% homology to SEQ ID NO:2, as either full-length or a fragment or a domain thereof, as a mutant or the polypeptide encoded by a spliced variant nucleic acid sequence, as a chimera with other polypeptides, provided that any of the above has the same or substantially the same biological function as the p53 polypeptide.<br>
Generally, the siRNAs used in the present invention comprise a ribonucleic acid comprising a double stranded structure, whereby the double-stranded structure comprises a first strand and<br>
9<br><br>

It is noted that the delivery of the siRNA compounds according to the present invention to the target cells in the kidney proximal tubules is particularily effective in the treatment of acute renal failure. Without being bound by theory, this may be due to the fact that normally siRNA molecules are excreted from the body via the cells of the kidney proximal tubules. Thus, naked siRNA molecules are naturally concentrated in the cells that are targeted for the therapy in acute renal failure.<br>

example of a nucleotide analog is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in DNA (or RNA) is replaced with a polyamide backbone similar to that found in peptides. PNA analogs have been shown to be resistant to degradation by enzymes and to have extended lives in vivo and in vitro. Further, PNAs have been shown to bind more strongly to a complementary DNA sequence than to a DNA molecule. This observation is attributed to the lack of charge repulsion between the PNA strand and the DNA strand. Other modifications that can be made to oligonucleotides include polymer backbones, cyclic backbones, or acyclic backbones.<br>
In one embodiment the modification is a modification of the phosphate moiety, whereby the modified phosphate moiety is selected from the group comprising phosphothioate.<br>

Note: Systems for testing the active siRNA are described in Botcharev et al, 2000, p53 is essential for Chemotherapy -induced Hair Loss, Cancer Research, 60, 5002-5006).<br>
EXAMPLE 4: Model systems of acute renal failure (ARF).<br>
Testing the active siRNA for treating ARF may be done using sepsis-induced ARF or ischemia-reperfusion-induced ARF.<br>
1.	Sepsis induced ARF<br>
Two predictive animal models of sepsis-induced ARF are described by Miyaji T, Hu X, Yuen PS, Muramatsu Y, Iyer S, Hewitt SM, Star RA, 2003, Ethyl pyruvate decreases sepsis-induced acute renal failure and multiple organ damage in aged mice, Kidney Int. Nov;64(5): 1620-31. These two models are lipopolysaccharide administration and cecal ligation puncture in mice, preferably in aged mice.<br>
2.	Ischemia-reperfusion-induced ARF<br>
This predictive animal model is described by Kelly KJ, Plotkin Z, Vulgamott SL, Dagher PC, 2003 January,. P53 mediates the apoptotic response to GTP depletion after renal ischemia-reperfiision: protective role of a p53 inhibitor, J Am Soc Nephrol.;14(l):128-38.<br>
Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in rats following 45 minutes bilateral kidney arterial clamp and subsequent release of the clamp to allow 24 hours of reperfusion. 250 [ig of p53 siRNA (QM5 sequence, Table A) were injected into the jugular vein 2 hrs prior to and 30 minutes following the clamp. Additional 250µg of siRNA were given via the tail vein at 4 and 8 hrs after the clamp. siRNA against GFP served as a negative control. The siRNA used in the experiments described herein had a phosphate group at the 3' terminus of both the sense and antisense strand . The 3'-non-phosphorylated siRNA has been found to have similar biologically activity in an animal model as the corresponding 3'-phosphorylated siRNA. ARF progression was monitored by measurement of serum creatinine levels before<br>
44<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
and 24 hrs post surgery. At the end of the experiment, the rats were perfused via an indwelling femoral line with warm PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The left kidneys were removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent histological analysis. Acute renal failure is frequently defined as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. An increase of at least 0.5 mg per dL or 44.2 µmol per L of serum creatinine is considered as an indication for acute renal failure. Serum creatinine was measured at time zero before the surgery and at 24 hours post ARF surgery.<br>
To study the distribution of p53 siRNA in the rat kidney, Cy3-labeled 19-mer blunt-ended siRNA molecules (2 mg/kg) having alternating Omethyl modification in the sugar residues were administered iv for 3-5 min, after which in vivo imaging was conducted using two-photon confocal microscopy. The confocal microscopy analysis revealed that the majority of siRNA in the kidneys is concentrated in the endosomal compartment of proximal tubular cells. Both endosomal and cytoplasmic siRNA fluorescence were relatively stable during the first 2 hrs post delivery and disappeared at 24 hrs.<br>
As evident from Figure 5, there was a ten-fold increase in the level of serum creatinine following the 45-min of kidney bilateral arterial clamp treatment (PBS treatment). Four injections of p53 siRNA (QM5 sequence, Table A) (2 hrs prior to the clamp and 30min, 4h and 8h after the clamp) significantly reduced the creatinine level in serum by 50% (P 
The effect of p53 siRNA treatment on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury was further determined by analysing the extent of tubular necrosis in the renal tissue. Tubular necrosis may be scored as: no damage (damage scoring 0), unicellular, patchy isolated necrosis (damage scoring 1), tubular necrosis in less than 25% of the tissue (damage scoring 2), tubular necrosis in between 25 and 50% of the tissue (damage scoring 3) and tubular necrosis in more than 50% of the tissue (damage scoring 4). Figure 6 demonstrates the tubular kidney damage expressed as damage scoring (Y-axis) in animals that did not undergo ischemia-reperfusion injury (group 1) or in ischemia-reperfusion injury animals following treatment with either PBS (group 2), two injections of p53 siRNA (group 3), three injections of p53 siRNA (group 4) or four injections of p53 siRNA (group 5). As revealed by Figure 6, four injections of p53 siRNA led to significant decrease in the tubular kidney damage as compared<br>
45<br><br>
WO 2006/035434	PCT/IL2005/001035<br>
to the PBS control group. Figure 7 demonstrates that four injections of p53 siRNA treatment down-regulated the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene Puma in the cortical compartment of the kidney in animal subjected to ischemia-reperfiision injury. This indicates that p53 siRNA treatment is capable of inhibiting the apoptotic processes in the kidney following ischemia-reperfusion injury.<br>
