				<td>[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Belongs]<br>
The present invention relates to a brake device used for a small vehicle such as a motorcycle, and more particularly to an interlocking brake device for a small vehicle which includes an independent brake manipulation system which operates either one of a front wheel brake and a rear wheel brake singly or an interlocking brake manipulation system which operates both of the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake in an interlocking manner. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
For example, in the motorcycle, when a right-grip-side independent brake lever mounted on a steering handle is manipulated, only a front wheel brake is operated, while when a left-grip-side interlocking brake lever is manipulated, not only the rear wheel brake but also the front wheel brake are operated in an interlocking manner. Accordingly, a brake device of the motorcycle is provided with an interlocking device which interlocks the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake between a front brake cable which operates the front wheel brake and a rear brake cable which operates the rear wheel brake. [0003]<br>
As such an interlocking device which has been conventionally known, there exists an interlocking device described in Patent Document 1. The interlocking device is<br>
configured as follows . In the inside of an equalizer case which is installed in the vicinity of a head pipe of the motorcycle, an equalizer lever which forms a front wheel brake manipulating end portion at one end portion thereof and a rear wheel brake manipulating end portion at another end portion thereof is housed. An interlocking brake manipulating cable which is connected to an interlocking brake lever is connected to an intermediate portion of the equalizer lever, at the same time, a front brake cable which operates the front wheel brake and a rear brake cable which operates the rear wheel brake are respectively connected to both end portions of the equalizer lever. To the front brake cable, an independent brake manipulating cable which is connected to an independent brake lever is connected by way of a joint member having an elongated hole. The front wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever is slidably and rotatably engaged with the elongated hole of the joint member. [0004]<br>
According to such an interlocking device, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed by manipulating the interlocking brake lever, the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever is pulled and the rear brake cable is towed along with pulling of the equalizer lever whereby the rear wheel brake is operated. Then, when a load at the rear wheel brake side arrives at a certain magnitude, the front brake cable is also<br>
towed whereby the front wheel brake is operated together with the rear wheel brake. On the other hand, when the independent brake manipulating cable is towed by manipulating the independent brake lever, the front brake cable is towed by way of the joint member whereby the front wheel brake is operated. At this point of time, since a towing force does not act on the equalizer lever which is engaged with the elongated hole formed in the joint member, the rear brake cable is not operated at all. Accordingly, the rear wheel brake is not operated and only the front wheel brake is operated singly. [0005] [Patent Document 1]<br>
JP-A-2000-309294. [0006] [Problems that the Invention is to Solve]<br>
However, as described in the above-mentioned Patent Document 1, the independent brake manipulating cable which is manipulated by the independent brake lever and the front brake cable which operates the front wheel brake are connected to each other by way of the joint member. Accordingly, not only it is necessary to provide the joint member but also the cable of the independent brake manipulation system is to be divided into two cables and hence, there arise problems that the number of parts is increased and the assembling operation also becomes complicated. Further, in view of the necessity for forming the<br>
elongated hole in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable in the joint member, the joint member inevitably becomes elongated whereby an equalizer case for housing the joint member becomes large-sized. Accordingly, a large installation space becomes necessary for the equalizer case whereby the degree of freedom of the arrangement of the interlocking device is limited. Particularly with respect to the motorcycle, it is desirable to provide such an interlocking device in the vicinity of a head pipe in view of the arrangement of cables. However, to install such a large-sized interlocking device in the vicinity of the head pipe, a layout of a vehicle body is also restricted. [0007]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide an interlocking brake device for a small vehicle which exhibits the high degree of freedom of arrangement. [0008] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, a first aspect of the present invention lies in that, in an interlocking brake device for a small vehicle in which an interlocking brake manipulating cable is connected to an intermediate portion of an equalizer lever which forms a front wheel brake manipulating end portion at one end portion thereof and a rear wheel brake<br>
manipulating end portion at another end portion thereof, and when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed by the manipulation of an interlocking brake manipulating member, a front brake cable which operates a front wheel brake is towed using the front wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever and, at the same time, a rear brake cable which operates a rear wheel brake is towed using the rear wheel brake<br>
manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever, whereby the<br>
front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake are operated in an interlocking manner, either one of the front brake cable and ] the rear brake cable is formed as one independent brake manipulating cable which is connected to an independent brake manipulating member, an engaging member which is capable of being engaged with and being disengaged from the equalizer lever is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable, and when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed due to the manipulation of the interlocking brake manipulating member, the independent brake manipulating cable is towed due to an engagement of the equalizer lever with the engaging member, and when the independent brake manipulating cable is towed due to the manipulation of the independent brake manipulating member, the engaging member is spaced apart from the equalizer lever. [0009]<br>
According to this first aspect, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed by the manipulation of the<br>
interlocking brake manipulating member, the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever is pulled and the front or rear brake cable is towed by one end portion of the equalizer lever. Simultaneously, another end portion of the equalizer is engaged with the engaging member mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable and hence, the independent brake manipulating cable is also towed. Accordingly, the front wheel brake and the rear wheel brake are operated in an interlocking manner. Further, when the independent brake manipulating cable is towed by manipulating the independent brake manipulating member, the front wheel brake or the rear wheel brake which is manipulated by the independent brake manipulating cable is operated. Here, the engaging member which is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable is separated from the equalizer lever and hence, no towing force acts on the equalizer lever. Accordingly, another brake is not operated and only one brake is performed singly. [0010]<br>
In this manner, the independent brake manipulating cable is formed of one contiguous cable and hence, the elongated joint member becomes no more necessary whereby the number of parts can be reduced. Further, the mere mounting of the engaging member engageable and disengageable to the equalizer lever to the independent brake manipulating cable is sufficient and hence, the structure is extremely simplified. Accordingly,<br>
the whole interlocking device can be made compact and hence, the degree of freedom of arrangement of the interlocking device can be enhanced. [0011]<br>
Further, the second aspect of the present invention lies in that, in addition to the first aspect, a projecting portion which extends in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable is integrally mounted on the equalizer lever, and an elongated hole which extends in the same direction as the projecting portion and slidably and relatively rotatably supports the engaging member is formed in the projecting portion. [0012]<br>
According to the second aspect, since the engaging member is guided by the elongated hole formed in the equalizer lever, it is possible to ensure the stable operation of the interlocking device. Further, since the elongated hole can be formed in the projecting portion which is integrally formed with the equalizer lever, the equalizer lever can be light-weighted and miniaturized. [0013]<br>
Further, the third aspect of the present invention lies in that, in addition to the first aspect or the second aspect, the respective cables are arranged substantially in parallel to each other in the vicinity of the equalizer lever, and<br>
respective connecting portions between the cables and the equalizer lever are positioned on the same plane which is substantially orthogonal to the respective cables when both of the interlocking brake manipulating cable and the independent brake manipulating cable are in a non-operative state. [0014]<br>
According to the third aspect, since the respective cables are arranged substantially in parallel to each other, it is possible to make the cables perform the smooth transmission of the manipulating forces. Further, when both of the interlocking brake manipulating cable and the independent brake manipulating cable are in a non-operative state, by positioning the respective connecting portions between the equalizer lever and the cables on the same plane which is substantially orthogonal to the respective cables, it is possible to form the equalizer lever in the simple shape and hence, the interlocking device can be made more compact. [0015]<br>
Further, the fourth aspect of the present invention lies in that, in addition to any one of the first to third aspects, the brake device includes a resilient body which pushes and biases the front wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever toward a non-operative position. [0016]<br>
According to the fourth aspect, when the interlocking<br>
brake manipulating cable is towed, first of all, the equalizer lever is rotated about one point of the front wheel brake manipulating portion and hence, the rear brake cable is towed from the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion to operate the rear wheel brake and, thereafter, with a slight time lag, the front brake cable is towed to operate the front wheel brake whereby it is possible to perform the stable braking which can suppress the pitching of the vehicle. [0017]<br>
Further, the fifth aspect of the present invention lies in that, in addition to the first aspect, to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever, a plurality of rear brake cables which respectively operate a plurality of rear wheel brakes are connected by way of equalizer means. [0018]<br>
Here, the equalizer means corresponds to a link lever 36 and a second equalizer lever 37 in the embodiments of the present invention described later. [0019]<br>
According to the fifth aspect, even with respect to a vehicle having a plurality of rear wheels such as a three-wheeled vehicle, it is possible to operate the brakes of respective rear wheels and hence, it is unnecessary to provide interlocking devices for a plurality of rear wheel brakes separately whereby an installation space can be reduced to a<br>
minimum. [0020]<br>
Further, the sixth aspect of the present invention lies in that, in addition to any one of the first to fifth aspects, both of the interlocking brake manipulating member and the independent brake manipulating member constitute brake levers which are pivotally mounted on a steering handle which is mounted on an upper portion of a vehicle body, and the equalizer lever is arranged in the vicinity of a head pipe which is mounted below the steering handle. [0021]<br>
According to the sixth aspect, it is possible to arrange the equalizer lever at the position substantially equidistantly away from the interlocking brake lever and the independent brake lever which are respectively mounted on both end portions of the steering handle and hence, the arrangement of the cables can be facilitated. The reason that the interlocking device can be installed in the vicinity of the head pipe which is advantageous for arranging the cables is that the whole interlocking device can be made compact. [0022] [Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
The mode for carrying out the present invention is explained in conjunction with embodiments shown in attached drawings hereinafter.<br><br>
The present invention relates to an interlocking brake device for a small vehicle in which an interlocking brake manipulating cable is connected to an intermediate portion of an equalizer lever which forms a front wheel brake manipulating end portion at one end portion thereof and a rear wheel brake manipulating end portion at another end portion thereof,<br>

[0024]<br>
First of all, the first embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 7 is explained. [0025]<br>
In Fig. 1, on a steering handle 2 which is mounted on an upper end portion of a vehicle body 1 of a motorcycle, an independent brake lever 3 which constitutes an independent brake manipulating member is pivotally mounted adjacent to a right grip 2a, while an interlocking brake lever 4 which constitutes an interlocking brake manipulating member is pivotally mounted adjacent to a left grip 2b. An independent brake manipulating cable 5 is connected to the independent brake<br>
lever 3 and the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed by manipulating the independent brake lever 3. Further, an interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is connected to the interlocking brake lever 4 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is towed by manipulating the interlocking brake lever 4. The respective brake levers 3, 4 are respectively biased in the non-operative direction due to return springs 3a, 4a. [0026]<br>
On the other hand, a front brake cable 8 is connected to an operating lever If of a drum-type front wheel brake Bf which is mounted on a front wheel of the motorcycle and the front wheel brake Bf is operated by towing the front brake cable 8 . Further, a rear brake cable 9 is connected to an operating lever 7r of a drum-type rear wheel brake Br which is mounted on a rear wheel and the rear wheel brake Br is operated by towing the rear brake cable 9. The operating levers It, 7r of the respective brakes Bf, Br are biased in the non-operative direction respectively by return springs lOf, lOr. An interlocking device 11 is provided between the independent brake manipulating cable 5, the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 and the front brake cable 8, the rear brake cable 9. Then, due to the provision of the interlocking device 11, as described later, the front wheel brake Bf is singly operated when the independent brake lever 3 is manipulated and the front wheel brake Bf and the rear<br>
wheel brake Br are operated in an interlocking manner when the<br>
interlocking brake lever 4 is manipulated.<br>
[0027]<br>
The interlocking device 11 includes an equalizer case 12 which is mounted on the vehicle body 1 of the motorcycle. As can be clearly understood from Fig. 2 to Fig. 4, the equalizer case 12 is formed in a container shape having a substantially rectangular cross-section which opens at a rear surface side thereof. The equalizer case 12 is fixed to a side surface of the vehicle body by a bolt 13 in the vicinity of a head pipe Ih positioned below the steering handle 2 thus forming a housing space 14 between the equalizer case 12 and the vehicle body 1. An equalizer lever 15 is housed in the housing space 14 in an elevatable and rotatable state. The equalizer lever 15 has a U-shaped cross-section (see Fig. 4) in which a pair of side walls 15s, 15s which face each other in an opposed manner with a distance therebetween are formed by folding both side portions of one metal sheet upwardly. The equalizer lever 15 integrally includes a body portion 15a which extends along a lower wall 12b of the equalizer case 12 in a non-operative position and a projecting portion 15b which extends in the direction substantially orthogonal to the body portion 15a. One end portion (a left end portion in Fig. 2) of the body portion 15a constitutes a front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and another end portion (a right end portion in Fig. 2) of the<br>
body portion 15a constitutes a rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R. The above-mentioned projecting portion 15b is formed in the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F. The distance between the pair of side walls 15s, 15s is set slightly larger than diameters of respective cables 5, 6; 8, 9. In the projecting portion 15b of the equalizer lever 15, an elongated hole 16 which extends along the projecting portion 15b is formed. Further, with respect to the body portion 15a, connection holes 17, 18 are formed in an intermediate portion between the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R and in the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F. These connection holes 17, 18 and a lower end portion of the elongated hole 16 are arranged to be positioned on the substantially same plane. [0028]<br>
In an upper wall 12a of the equalizer case 12, bosses 19, 20 which respectively allow the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 to pass therethrough are integrally formed and adjusting bolts 23, 24 having lock nuts 21, 22 are threaded into these bosses 19, 20. The adjusting bolts 23, 24 are respectively provided for supporting end portions of respective outer casings 5a, 6a of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6. Further, on a lower wall 12b of<br>
the equalizer case 12, bosses 25,26 which allows the front brake cable 8 and the rear brake cable 9 to pass therethrough respectively are integrally formed. With the provision of these bosses 25, 26, end portions of respective outer casings 8a, 9a of the front brake cable 8 and a rear brake cable 9 are respectively supported. [0029]<br>
The boss 19 which allows the independent brake manipulating cable 5 to pass therethrough and the boss 25 which allows the front brake cable 8 to pass therethrough are arranged to be positioned on the substantially one straight line at one end sides of the upper wall 12a and the lower wall 12b of the equalizer case 12. Further, the boss 20 which allows the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 to pass therethrough is provided at a substantially center portion of the upper wall 12a and the boss 26 which allows the rear brake cable 9 to pass therethrough is formed at the other-end side of the lower wall 12b. With respect to the above-mentioned elongated hole 16 and the connection holes 17, 18 formed in the equalizer lever 15, when the equalizer lever 15 is in the non-operative position, the elongated hole 16 is positioned on a straight line which connects the bosses 19, 25, the center connection hole 17 is arranged at a position where the connection hole 17 faces the boss 20 in an opposed manner, and the connection hole 18 at the right end portion is arranged at a position where the connection<br>
hole 18 faces the boss 26 in an opposed manner. [0030]<br>
The independent brake manipulating cable 5 has one end thereof connected to the independent brake lever 3 and a columnar connecting terminal 27 is fixedly mounted on another end of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 . On the other hand, to another end of the front brake cable 8 which has one end thereof connected to the operating lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf, a cylindrical resin cover 28 which removes an upper end portion of a peripheral wall thereof is fixedly mounted. Then, the connecting terminal 27 is fitted into the resin cover 28. In this manner, the front brake cable 8 is connected to the independent brake manipulating cable 5 by way of the resin cover 28 and the connecting terminal 27 thus forming a portion (a lower-side portion) of one independent brake manipulating cable 5 which connects the independent brake lever 3 and the operating lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf. [0031]<br>
The independent brake manipulating cable 5 is configured to pass between a pair of side walls 15s, 15s of the equalizer lever 15 and to penetrate a bottom wall of the equalizer lever 15. Then, the connecting terminal 27 and the resin cover 28 which are mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 are positioned in the inside of the elongated hole 16 formed in the equalizer lever 15. A length of the resin cover 28 is<br>
set larger than the distance between the pair of side walls 15s, 15s. Further, an outer diameter of the resin cover 28 is set to a value which allows the resin cover 28 to be slidable along the elongated hole 16. Accordingly, the resin cover 28 is engageable with and disengageable from the lower end of the elongated hole 16 formed in the equalizer lever 15 and is capable of performing the relative rotation with respect to the equalizer lever 15. That is, in this embodiment, due to the connecting terminal 27 which connects an upper-side portion and a lower-side portion of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the resin cover 28, an engaging member 29 which is engageable with and disengageable from the equalizer lever 15 and is supported slidably and relatively rotatably by the elongated hole 16 is formed. [0032]<br>
On another end of the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 which has one end thereof connected with the interlocking brake lever 4, a cylindrical connecting terminal 30 is fixedly mounted. The interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is made to pass through between the pair of side walls 15s, 15s of the equalizer lever 15. On the other hand, into the center connecting hole 17 formed in the equalizer lever 15, a cylindrical resin cover 31 from which an upper end portion of a peripheral portion thereof is removed is fitted. Then, the connecting terminal 30 of the interlocking brake<br>
manipulating cable 6 is fitted into the resin cover 31.  In this manner, the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is connected to the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever 15 in a relatively rotatable manner. [0033]<br>
Further, to another end of the rear brake cable 9 which has one end thereof connected to the operating lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br, a columnar connecting terminal 32 is fixedly mounted. The rear brake cable 9 penetrates the bottom wall of the equalizer lever 15 and passes through between the pair of side walls 15s, 15s. On the other hand, into a connecting hole 18 formed in a right end portion of the equalizer lever 15, a cylindrical resin cover 33 which removes a lower end portion of a peripheral wall thereof is fitted. Then, the connecting terminal 32 of the rear brake cable 9 is fitted into the resin cover 33. In this manner, the rear brake cable 9 is connected to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R of the equalizer lever 15 in a relatively rotatable manner. [0034]<br>
Due to the above-mentioned arrangement between the elongated hole 16 and the connecting holes 17, 18 of the equalizer lever 15 and the respective bosses 19, 20; 25, 26 of the equalizer case 12, when the equalizer lever 15 is in a non-operative position, in the inside of the equalizer case 12, all of the independent brake manipulating cable 5, the<br>
interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 and the rear brake cable 9 are arranged parallel to each other. Further, the body portion 15a of the equalizer lever 15 is arranged to be orthogonal to these cables 5, 6, 9. The resin covers 28, 31, 33 are designed to have the same diameter. Further, when the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is in the non-operative state, as described later, the engaging member 29 is engaged with the lower end of the elongated hole 16 formed in the equalizer lever 15. Accordingly, in such a state, the connecting portions between the respective cables 5,6, 9 and the equalizer lever 15, that is, the connecting terminals 27, 30, 32 are positioned on the same plane orthogonal to the respective cables 5, 6, 9. Between the upper wall 12a of the equalizer case 12 and the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15, a set spring 34 is provided in a state that a given compression load is applied and hence, the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 is pushed and biased toward the non-operative position, that is, in the downward direction. Further, on a lower surface of the upper wall 12a of the equalizer case 12, a stopper 35 is provided at a position which faces the projecting portion 15b formed on the equalizer lever 15. [0035]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of the first embodiment is explained.<br>
[0036]<br>
The front brake cable 8 and the rear brake cable 9 which constitute a lower-side portion of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 are biased in the non-operative direction, that is, downwardly in Fig. 2 due to return springs lOf, lOr which are respectively mounted on the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br. Further, a biasing force in the downward direction is applied to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 by the set spring 34. Accordingly, when the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 are both in the non-operative state, that is, when the manipulating force is applied to neither the independent brake lever 3 nor the interlocking brake lever 4, as shown in Fig. 2, the bottom surface of the equalizer lever 15 is brought into contact with the upper surface of the lower wall 12b of the equalizer case 12 and hence, the engaging member 29 which is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is held in a state that the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is engaged with the lower end of the elongated hole 16 of the equalizer lever 15. When the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed by manipulating the independent brake lever 3 in this state, the towing force is directly transmitted to the operating lever If of. the front wheel brake Bf by way of the front brake cable 8 which constitutes the lower-side portion<br>
of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and hence, the front wheel brake Bf is operated. Here, the engaging member 29 which is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is also moved together with the cable 5. However, the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is configured to be operated in the direction orthogonal to the body portion 15a of the equalizer lever 15 in the inside of the interlocking device 11, that is, in the direction along the elongated hole 16 formed in the projecting direction of the projecting portion 15b. Accordingly, the engaging member 29 which is mounted on the cable 5, as shown in Fig. 5, is elevated only along the elongated hole 16 formed in the equalizer lever 15 and hence, the engaging member 29 does not apply any influence to the equalizer lever 15. Further, since the engaging member 29 is spaced apart from the body portion 15a of the equalizer lever 15, the biasing force of the return spring lOf of the front wheel brake Bf which acts on the equalizer lever 15 is removed. However, the biasing force of the set spring 34 is also applied to the equalizer lever 15 and hence, the equalizer lever 15 is held in the original state or at the non-operative position. Accordingly, the rear brake cable 9 performs no operation. [0037]<br>
In this manner, when the independent brake lever 3 is operated, the rear wheel brake Br is not operated and only the front wheel brake Bf is operated singly. When the manipulating<br>
force of the independent brake lever 3 is released, the operating lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf returns to the original position due to the biasing force of the return spring lOf and hence, the front wheel brake Bf assumes the non-operative state. [0038]<br>
Further, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is towed by manipulating the interlocking brake lever 4, the towing force is transmitted to the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever 15 and the towing force is distributed to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R respectively corresponding to a lever ratio thereof using the equalizer lever 15. However, since the biasing force in the downward direction is applied to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 due to the set spring 34, during a period that the towing force distributed to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F is small, the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 is held at a lower limit. Accordingly, the equalizer lever 15 is, initially, as shown in Fig. 6, rotated in the counterclockwise direction about a contact point P between the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and the lower wall 12b of the equalizer case 12. As a result, the rear brake cable 9 which is connected to the rear wheel brake manipulating<br>
end portion 15R is towed and the towing force is transmitted to the operating lever 7r of the rear wheel brake Br and hence, the rear wheel brake Br is operated. In this manner, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is manipulated, first of all, the rear wheel brake Br is operated. [0039]<br>
In this state, when the towing force of the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is further increased by successively manipulating the interlocking brake lever 4, as time lapses, the towing force distributed to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 exceeds a set load of the set spring 34. Then, the set spring 34 is compressed and, as shown in Fig. 7, the whole equalizer lever 15 is elevated. As a result, the rear brake cable 9 is further towed and, at the same time, the engaging member 29 which is engaged with the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 is pushed upwardly and hence, the independent brake manipulating cable 5 to which the engaging member 29 is fixedly mounted is pulled upwardly. Accordingly, the front wheel brake Bf is operated. Then, when the manipulating force of the interlocking brake lever 4 reaches a given magnitude, an upper end of the projecting portion 15b of the equalizer lever 15 comes into contact with a stopper 35 which is formed on a lower surface of the upper wall 12a of the equalizer case 12 and hence, the further elevation of the front<br>
wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 is prevented. Accordingly, the further increase of the braking force of the front wheel brake Bf is prevented and, thereafter, only the braking force of the rear brake Br is increased. [0040]<br>
In this manner, when the interlocking brake lever 4 is manipulated, first of all, the rear wheel brake Br is operated and, thereafter, the front wheel brake Bf is operated in an interlocking manner with a slight time lag. Accordingly, braking is applied to the front and rear wheels substantially simultaneously while preventing pitching of the vehicle and hence, stable braking of the motorcycle is performed. [0041]<br>
When the manipulating force of the interlocking brake lever 4 is released, the respective operating levers 7f, 7r of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br are made to return to the original positions due to the biasing forces of the return springs lOf, lOr and hence, both of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brake Br assume the non-operative state. Then, the interlocking device 11 also returns to the state shown in Fig. 2. [0042]<br>
As has been described above, according to the present invention, the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is<br>
connected to the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever 15 and, at the same time, the engaging member 29 which is engageable with or disengageable from the equalizer lever 15 is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5, wherein when the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed, the engaging member 29 is spaced apart from the equalizer lever 15 and when the equalizer lever 15 is operated by towing the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6, the equalizer lever 15 is engaged with the engaging member 29 thus enabling towing of the independent brake manipulating cable 5. Accordingly, while the independent brake manipulating cable 5 can be formed of a single continuous cable starting from the independent brake lever 3 to the operating lever 7f of the front wheel brake Bf, the single operating of the front wheel brake Bf and the interlocking operation of the front and rear wheel brakes Bf, Br can be performed separately. Further, by forming the independent brake manipulating cable 5 as such a single continuous cable, the whole independent brake manipulating cable 5 becomes a single part and hence, the number of parts can be reduced. Further, it is sufficient to mount only the engaging member 29 which is engageable with or disengageable from the equalizer lever 15 on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and hence, a long joint member which has been used conventionally becomes no more necessary whereby it is possible to make the equalizer case 12 which houses the<br>
equalizer lever 15 compact. Accordingly, the degree of freedom of arrangement of the equalizer case 12, that is, the interlocking device 11 can be enhanced. [0043]<br>
Further, the projecting portion 15b which extends in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is mounted on the equalizer lever 15 and the elongated hole 16 which extends in the same direction as the projecting portion 15b and slidably and rotatably supports the engaging member 29 mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is formed in the projecting portion 15b. Accordingly, during the single operation of the independent brake manipulating cable 5, the engaging member 29 is guided by the elongated hole 16. As a result, the engaging member 29 is always engaged with the equalizer lever 15 at a fixed position of the equalizer lever 15 and hence, the stable operation of the interlocking device 11 can be ensured. Further, since the elongated hole 16 is formed in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable 5, it is unnecessary to make the projecting portion 15b in which the elongated hole 16 is formed rotatable with respect to the body portion 15a of the equalizer lever 15. Accordingly, the equalizer lever 15 can be light-weighted and miniaturized. Further, the independent brake manipulating cable 5, the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 and the rear brake cable 9 are arranged parallel to each other in the<br>
vicinity of the equalizer lever 15. Accordingly, the transmission of the manipulating force among these cables 5, 6, 9 by way of the equalizer lever 15 can be performed smoothly whereby the stable operation of the interlocking device can be ensured. Further, when both of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 are in the non-operative state, the respective connecting portions between these cables 5, 6, 9 and the equalizer lever 15, that is, the connecting terminals 27, 30, 32 are positioned on the same plane orthogonal to the respective cables 5, 6, 9. Accordingly, the equalizer lever 15 can be formed in the substantially L shape consisting of the substantially horizontally extending body portion 15a and the projecting portion 15b orthogonal to the body portion 15a and hence, the equalizer lever 15 can have a simple shape whereby the interlocking device 11 can be made further compact. [0044]<br>
Further, the interlocking device 11 is further provided with the set spring 34 which pushes and biases the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 toward the non-operative position. Accordingly, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is towed, first of all, the equalizer lever 15 is rotated in the upward direction about the contact point P between the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and the lower wall 12b of the equalizer case<br>
12, the rear brake cable 9 which is connected to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R is towed so that the rear wheel brake Br is operated and, thereafter, the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed with a slight time lag and hence, the front wheel brake Bf is operated. Accordingly, it is possible to perform the stable braking which suppresses the pitching of the vehicle. [0045]<br>
Next, the second embodiment of the present invention shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 is explained. [0046]<br>
The second embodiment is a case in which the present invention is applied to an interlocking brake device for a three-wheeled vehicle. The second embodiment differs from the above-mentioned first embodiment only with respect to the constitution of the rear wheel brake manipulation system which is connected to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R of the equalizer lever 15 and is substantially equal to the above-mentioned embodiment with respect to other constitutions . Accordingly, parts corresponding to the parts of the above-mentioned embodiment are given same symbols and their explanation is omitted. [0047]<br>
As shown in Fig. 8, to operating levers 7rl, 7r2 of the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 which are respectively mounted on<br>
a pair of rear wheels, rear brake cables 91, 92 are respectively connected, wherein by towing the rear brake cables 91, 92, the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are respectively operated. The operating levers 7rl, 7r2 of the respective rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are respectively biased in the non-operative direction by return springs lOrl, 10r2. [0048]<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 9, to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R of the equalizer lever 15 to which the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is connected, one end of a metal-made link lever 36 is rotatably connected by way of a connecting terminal 32 which is fitted into an end portion 15R. Another end of the link lever 36 is rotatably connected to a center portion 37a of a second equalizer lever 37. Further, the above-mentioned rear brake cables 91, 92 are respectively connected to both end portions 37b, 37c of the second equalizer lever 37. Distances from the center portion 37a to both end portions 37b, 37c of the second equalizer lever 37 are set equal. Accordingly, when the link lever 36 is pulled upwardly, both of the rear brake cables 91, 92 which are connected to both end portions of the second equalizer lever 37 are towed by the same force and hence, the pair of rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are simultaneously operated. [0049]<br>
These link lever 36 and the second equalizer lever 37 are<br>
housed in the inside of a common equalizer case 12S together with the equalizer lever 15 to which the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is connected. On a lower wall 12Sb of the equalizer case 12S, at positions which face both end portions 37b, 37c of the second equalizer lever 37, bosses 261, 262 which allow the respective rear brake cables 91, 92 to pass therethrough are integrally formed. On these bosses 261, 262, end portions of respective outer casings 9al, 9a2 of the rear brake cables 91, 92 are respectively supported. Accordingly, the rear brake cables 91, 92 are arranged substantially in parallel to the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 in the inside of the equalizer case 12S. Further, the link lever 36 is also arranged parallel to these cables 5, 6. [0050]<br>
Also in the second embodiment, when the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed by manipulating the independent brake lever 3, the towing force is transmitted to the operating lever If of the front wheel brake Bf and hence, the front wheel brake Bf is operated. Here, although an engaging member 29 which is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is also moved together with the cable 5, the engaging member 29 is moved along the elongated hole 16 which extends in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and hence, no force acts on the equalizer lever 15.<br>
Accordingly, the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are not operated and only the front wheel brake Bf is singly operated. [0051]<br>
Further, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 is towed by manipulating the interlocking brake lever 4, due to the towing force, an intermediate portion of the equalizer lever 15 is pulled upwardly. Here, since a downward load is applied to a front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 by a set spring 34, the equalizer lever 15 is, first of all, rotated in the upward direction about a contact point P between the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F and a lower wall 12Sb of the equalizer case 12S and a link lever 36 which is connected to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion 15R is pulled upwardly. Accordingly, the second equalizer lever 37 is pulled upwardly, the rear brake cables 91, 92 which are respectively connected to both end portions 37b, 37c of the second equalizer lever 37 are towed, and the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are operated first of all. Thereafter, the independent brake manipulating cable 5 is towed with a slight time lag and the front wheel brake Bf is operated. [0052]<br>
In this manner, also in the second embodiment, when the independent brake lever 3 is manipulated, the front wheel brake Bf is singly operated, while when the interlocking brake lever 4 is operated, first of all, the pair of rear wheel brakes Brl,<br>
Br2 are simultaneously operated and, thereafter, the front wheel brake Bf is operated in an interlocking manner with a slight time lag. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain the manner of operation and advantageous effects substantially equal to those of the first embodiment. [0053]<br>
Further, according to the second embodiment, the equalizer lever 15 which enables the interlocking operations of the front wheel brake Bf and the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 and the second equalizer lever 37 which enables the interlocking operation of the pair of the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 are housed in the inside of the common equalizer case 12S. Accordingly, also with respect to a vehicle having a plurality of rear wheels such as a three-wheeled vehicle, it is possible to respectively operate the brakes Brl, Br2 of the respective rear wheels using one interlocking device 11. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to separately provide interlocking devices for a plurality of rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 and hence, the installation space can be suppressed to a minimum. Further, since two equalizer levers 15, 37 can be connected to each other using the link lever 36 having rigidity, lowering of rigidity of the manipulating force transmission mechanism can be prevented. [0054]<br>
Further, in both of the above-mentioned first and second embodiments, the interlocking device 11 is arranged at<br>
positions substantially equally distant from the independent brake lever 3 and the interlocking brake lever 4 which are respectively mounted on both end portions of the steering handle 2 and in the vicinity of the head pipe Ih which is positioned below the steering handle 2 whereby the arrangement of respective cables 5, 6, 9 or 91, 92 is facilitated. Due to the above-mentioned constitution, the whole interlocking device can be made compact whereby it is possible to install the interlocking device 11 in the vicinity of the head pipe Ih which is advantageous for the arrangement of cables. [0055]<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been explained heretofore, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments and various design changes can be made without departing from the gist of the present invention. For example, although the front wheel brake Bf is singly operated using one independent brake manipulating cable 5 in the above-mentioned respective embodiments, it is possible to make the independent brake manipulating cable 5 operate the rear wheel brake Br or the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 and the interlocking brake manipulating cable 6 operate the front wheel brake Bf in an interlocking manner. Also in this case, by applying the load set by the set spring 34 to the front wheel brake manipulating end portion 15F of the equalizer lever 15 to which the front brake cable 8 which<br>
operates the front wheel brake Bf is connected, at the time of manipulating the interlocking brake lever 4, it is possible to operate the rear wheel brake Br or the rear wheel brakes Brl, Br2 prior to the front wheel brake Bf. Further, as the engaging member 29, in place of making use of the connecting terminal<br>
27	which connects the upper portion and the lower portion of<br>
the independent brake manipulating cable 5 and the resin cover<br>
28	described in the above-mentioned embodiments, the whole<br>
independent brake manipulating cable 5 may be completely formed<br>
of one cable and a suitable engaging member 29 may be mounted<br>
on the independent brake manipulating cable 5.  In this case,<br>
by enabling the adjustment of the mounting position of the<br>
engaging member 29 to the independent brake manipulating cable<br>
5, it is possible to arbitrarily set the installation position<br>
of the interlocking device 11. Further, as the set spring 34,<br>
it is possible to use a resilient body such as rubber besides<br>
the coil spring shown in the drawing.<br>
[0056]<br>
[Advantage of the Invention]<br>
As has been described heretofore, according to the first aspect of the present invention, the interlocking brake manipulating cable which is towed by the manipulation of the interlocking brake manipulating member is connected to the intermediate portion of the equalizer lever and, at the same time, the engaging member which is engageable with or<br>
disengageable from the equalizer lever is mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable which is towed by the independent brake manipulating member, wherein when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed, the equalizer lever is operated and is engaged with the engaging member thus also towing the independent brake manipulating cable, and when the independent brake manipulating cable is towed, the engaging member is spaced apart from the equalizer lever. Accordingly, while the independent brake manipulating cable can be formed of a single continuous cable starting from the independent brake manipulating member to the operating lever of the front wheel brake or the rear wheel brake, the single operation of the front wheel brake or the rear wheel brake and the interlocking operation of the front and rear brakes can be performed respectively. Accordingly, the whole independent brake manipulating cable becomes a single part and hence, the number of parts can be reduced. Further, it is sufficient to mount only the engaging member which is engageable with or disengageable from the equalizer lever on the independent brake manipulating cable and hence, the interlocking device can be made compact. Accordingly, the degree of freedom of arrangement of the interlocking device can be enhanced. [0057]<br>
Further, according to the second aspect of the present invention, the projecting portion which extends in the<br>
operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable is integrally mounted on the equalizer lever and the elongated hole which extends in the same direction as the projecting portion and slidably and rotatably supports the engaging member mounted on the independent brake manipulating cable is formed in the projecting portion. Accordingly, during the single operation of the independent brake manipulating cable, the engaging member is guided by the elongated hole. As a result, the engaging member is always engaged with the equalizer lever at a fixed position of the equalizer lever and hence, the stable operation of the interlocking device can be ensured. Further, since the elongated hole is formed in the operating direction of the independent brake manipulating cable, it is possible to form the projecting portion in which the elongated hole is formed integrally with the equalizer lever and hence, the equalizer lever can be light-weighted and miniaturized. [0058]<br>
Further, according to the third aspect of the present invention, the independent brake manipulating cable, the interlocking brake manipulating cable and the front or rear brake cable are arranged parallel to each other in the vicinity of the equalizer lever. Accordingly, the transmission of the manipulating force among these cables by way of the equalizer lever can be performed smoothly whereby the stable operation of the interlocking device can be ensured. Further, when both<br>
of the independent brake manipulating cable and the interlocking brake manipulating cable are in the non-operative state, the respective connecting portions between these cables and the equalizer lever are positioned on the same plane orthogonal to the respective cables. Accordingly, the equalizer lever can have a simple shape whereby the interlocking device can be made further compact. [0059]<br>
Further, according to the fourth aspect of the present invention, the interlocking device is further provided with the resilient body which pushes and biases the front wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever toward the non-operative position. Accordingly, when the interlocking brake manipulating cable is towed, first of all, the equalizer lever is rotated about one point of the front wheel brake manipulating end portion and the rear brake cable is towed by the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion so that the rear wheel brake is operated and, thereafter, the front brake cable is towed with a slight time lag and hence, the front wheel brake is operated. Accordingly, it is possible to perform the stable braking which suppresses the pitching of the vehicle. [0060]<br>
Further, according to the fifth aspect of the present invention, to the rear wheel brake manipulating end portion of the equalizer lever, a plurality of rear brake cables which<br>
respectively operate a plurality of rear wheel brakes are connected by way of the equalizer means . Accordingly, even with respect to the vehicle having a plurality of rear wheels such as the three-wheeled vehicles, it is possible to operate the brakes of respective rear wheels using the single interlocking device and hence, it is unnecessary to provide interlocking devices for plurality of rear wheel brakes separately whereby the installation space for the interlocking device can be reduced to a minimum. [0061]<br>
Further, according to the sixth aspect of the present invention, both of the interlocking brake manipulating member and the independent brake manipulating member constitute brake levers which are pivotally mounted on the steering handle which is mounted on the upper portion of the vehicle body, and the equalizer lever is arranged in the vicinity of the head pipe which is mounted below the steering handle. Accordingly, the interlocking device can be installed in the vicinity of the head pipe which is advantageous for arranging the cables whereby the whole interlocking device can be made compact.<br>
