RECORDING MEDIUM HAVING A DATA STRUCTURE FOR MANAGING REPRODUCTION OF DATA STREAMS RECORDED THEREON AND RECORDING AND REPRODUCING METHODS AND APPARATUSES<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to high density recording media such as read-only blu-ray discs (BD-ROM) and methods and apparatuses associated therewith.<br>
Background Art<br>
Optical discs are widely used as an optical recording medium. Presently, of the optical discs, a new high density optical recording medium (HD-DVD), such as the Blu-ray Disc (hereafter called as "BD"), is under development, for writing and storing high definition video and audio data.<br>
Currently, global standard technical specifications of the Blu-ray Disc (BD), a next generation HD-DVD technology, are under development. BDs are viewed as a next generation optical recording solution that can store significantly larger amounts of data than present DVDs.<br>
In relation to this, optical reproducing apparatuses for Blu-ray Disc (BD) standards are under development. However, because the Blu-ray Disc (BD) standards are not complete yet, there has been difficulty in developing a complete optical reproducing apparatus.<br>
In a BD, main data such as AV data, and various lands of associated supplemental data for convenience of a user, such as subtitle information are provided. Furthermore, the BD provides management information for reproducing the main data and the supplementary data from the optical disc.<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2OO4/002616<br>
2<br>
However, in the present Blu-ray Disc (BD) standards, because consolidated standards of the supplementary data, particularly the subtitle information are not complete yet, there are many restrictions on the development of a Blu-ray Disc (BD) optical reproducing apparatus, which causes problems in reproducing supplemental data such as subtitle data and providing it to the user.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
A recording medium according to the present invention includes a data structure for managing reproduction of data streams recorded thereon.<br>
In one embodiment, the recording medium stores a playlist that includes a streams table, a playitem and a sub-playitem. The playitem includes information for managing reproduction of a main data stream of data packets, and the sub-playitem includes information for managing reproduction of at least one supplemental data stream of data packets. The streams table provides a list of packet identifiers in the data packets of the main and supplemental data streams.<br>
In one embodiment, the streams table may also provide stream attributes for each main and supplemental data stream for which the streams table lists a packet identifier.<br>
In a further embodiment, the recording medium stores a streams table defining a list of a main data stream and at least one supplemental data stream for selection by a reproducing apparatus during presentation of a playitem and sub-playitem. The playitem provides information for reproducing the main data stream and the sub-playitem provides information for reproducing the supplemental data stream.<br>

Best mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While terms used in the present invention are possibly selected from currently well-known terms, terms are arbitrarily chosen by the applicant in some cases and their meanings are explained in detail in the following description. Hence, the present invention should be understood with the meanings of the corresponding terms chosen by the applicant instead of the simple names of the terms.<br>
In relation to the above, main data in the present invention means, for example, title information on an optical disc, and may include video and audio data an author provides to a user, in general recorded in MPEG2 format, and may also be called a main AV stream.<br>
Supplementary or supplemental data means data related to the main data provided to a user for convenience of reproduction such as subtitle information, menu information, audio information for browsable slide show, etc. The supplemental information may be recorded in the MPEG2 format and multiplexed in a main AV stream, or recorded in the MPEG2 format or another format and stored as a stream file independent from the main AV stream.<br>
In the present invention, the subtitle data means a kind of caption information,<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
5<br>
displayed on a screen when the user selects the subtitle for reproduction with the main data. Therefore, the subtitle can be written in various formats, such as MPEG2 transport (TS) packets, bit-map form of binary format, text data, etc., and the subtitle recorded as text data is called a text subtitle.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a file structure for managing data on a disc in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown, at least one BD directory BDMV is included under a root directory. The BD directory includes an index file index.bdmv and an object file MovieObject bdmv as general files (upper files) for securing a user's interactivity, and includes three directories: a playlist directory PLAYLIST, a clipinfo directory CLIPINF, and a stream directory STREAM.<br>
The stream directory STREAM has files on a main video and audio stream (referred to as main AV stream) recorded in particular formats on the disc, and a stream related to a supplementary data, such as a subtitle (called as a subtitle stream). The main AV stream and the supplemental data streams are recorded in MPEG 2 transport packets, and an expansion name of such a file will generally be "*.m2ts". The A/V stream includes source packets of video and audio data. A source packet of video data includes a header and a transport packet. A source packet includes a source packet number, which is generally a sequentially assigned number that serves as an address for accessing the source packet According to the MPEG 2 standard, the transport packets include a packet identifier (PID). The PID identifies the sequence of transport packets to which a transport packet belongs. Each transport packet in the sequence will have the same PCD.<br>
Furthermore, the expansion name for the supplemental data may be different than "*.m2ts". For example, a subtitle stream will be, for example, "*.txt" if the subtitle stream is recorded in a text data format. If the subtitle stream is not recorded in the MPEG2 format, then a file expansion name proper to the format used may provided as the file expansion name. A stream file is sometimes called as a clip stream file in the BD standards, and in the present invention, the subtitle data will exist in a separate file form,<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
6<br>
e.g., as the subtitle stream file *.txt, separate from the AV stream.<br>
The clipinfo directory CLIPINF has clipinfo files, for example 01000.clpi and 02000.clpi, that have one-to-one correspondence with the respective stream files *.m2ts, and *.txt. Particularly, the clipinfo file *.clpi has attribute information and timing information of a relevant stream file. The timing information includes information on mapping a presentation time stamp (PTS) of data in the stream file to a source packet number of a source packet in the stream file. Typically this map is referred to as an entry point map.<br>
In the BD standard, the AV stream *.m2ts, *.txt files, or etc. and the associated clipinfo file *.clpi are called a "clip", collectively. Accordingly, the file 01000.clpi in the clipinfo directory CLIPINV has attribute information and timing information on the file 01000.m2ts in the stream directory, and the files 01000.clpi and 01000.ra2ts form a clip.<br>
The playlist directory PLAYLIST has playlist files *.mpls, each having at least one playitem designating a playing interval of a particular clip. Therefore, the playitem has information on a play starting time In-Time and play end time Out-Time of a particular clip desired to play, i.e., designated by a clip name Clip_Infonnation_File in the playitem. The playlist file *.mpls is basic play file information for playing a desired clip by providing at least one playitem. Moreover, the playlist file *.mpls is provided with a sub-playitem as necessary. The present invention suggests managing the supplementary data inclusive of the subtitle using the sub-playitem, of which detailed description will be given, later.<br>
In the BD directory BDMV, there are an index file index.bdmv and an object file MovieObject.bdmv as general files for securing a user's interactivity. The index file index.bdmv has an index table index Table providing menu information and title information Title the user can select. The MovieObject.bdmv provides navigation commands for, for example, executing a playlist, and may be called from a selection made in the index table.<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
7<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the disc volume of a BD-ROM is organized into a file system information area, a database area, and an A/V stream area. The file system information area stores system information for managing the disc. The database area includes a general files area and a playlist and clip information area. The general files area stores general files such as the index.bdmv file and the MovieObjectbdmv file. The playlist and clip information area stores the PLAYLIST directory and the CLIPINF directory. The main data and the supplementary data, such as audio/video/graphic, recorded thereon are stored as the MPEG2 transport stream formatted clip files (*.m2ts) in the A/V stream area. According to this, the reproducing apparatus determines the main data, and the supplementary data desired to reproduce, and a reproduction type, by using file information in the data base area Database Area.<br>
FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate diagrams each showing an exemplary case when subtitle data (as an example of supplemental data) and main data arc provided to a screen at the same time. FIG. 3A illustrates a diagram of a case where the text subtitle is in Korean, and FIG. 3B illustrates a diagram of a case where the text subtitle is in English.<br>
In relation to above, the present invention suggests to provide a plurality of subtitles as a subtitle stream file independent from a main data (main AV stream file). In one case, the plurality of subtitles form independent subtitle stream files respectively, and in another case the plurality of subtitles are united into one subtitle stream file.<br>
FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate first embodiments of the data structure for managing reproduction of the data streams recorded on the recording medium. Here, the subtitle data (as an example of supplemental data) linked with main data, includes a plurality of subtitles stored as independent subtitle stream files, and reproduction of the plurality of stream files are managed using one sub-playitem SubPlayItem.<br>
For an example, FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate a playItem PlayItem in the playlist PlayList includes reproduction managing information for reproducing the main data, and the   sub-playitem   SubPlayItem   includes  reproduction   managing   information   for<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
8<br>
reproducing the subtitle data. More specifically, subtitle stream files Subtitle Clip 1 and 2 for two subtitles in the languages of Korean and English, respectively are reproduced linked with one sub-playitem SubPlayItem in the playlist PlayList<br>
As further shown, there is a Playable_PID_cntries0 data structure for providing reproducible main data and subtitle information to the user as reproduction managing information in the playitem PlayItem for the main data, and in the sub-play item SubPlayItem for the subtitle data. FIG. 4B further illustrates that the playlist PlayList may include the data structure Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 for managing reproduction of both the main and subtitle data.<br>
Particularly, in the case of FIG. 4B, all cases are possible, in which the Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the common information area in the playlist PlayList, or the Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the playitem PlayItem only for the main data, and the Virtual_Playable__PID_entriesO including subtitle reproduction managing information in the common information area is provided in the playlist PlayList<br>
In relation to above, details of the data structures Playable_PID_entries0 and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO will be described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 7A-7D.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B illustrate second embodiments of the data structure for managing reproduction of the data streams recorded on the recording medium. Here, the subtitle (as an example of supplemental data) linked with the main data and forming a plurality of subtitles is stored as one subtitle stream file, and reproduction of the subtitle stream file is managed using one sub-playItem SubPlayItem.<br>
For example, in a case where two subtitles are united to form one subtitle stream file Subtitle Clip, and one subtitle file supports two language subtitles, the united subtitle stream file Subtitle Clip is reproduced linked with the sub-playitem SubPlayItem in the<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
9<br>
playlist PlayList Reproduction managing information for managing this is recorded in the sub-playitem SubPlayItem, or playlist PlayList<br>
According to this, the playitem PlayItem in the playlist PlayList includes reproduction managing information fox reproducing the main data, and the sub-playitcm SubPlayItem includes .reproduction managing information for reproducing the subtitle. Also, the Playable_PID_entries0 data structure is provided in the playitem PlayItem in relation to the main data and in the sub-playitem SubPlayItem in relation to the subtitle as shown in FIG. 5A, and/or the Virtual_Playablc_PID_entriesO data structure, which assists in managing reproduction of the main data and the subtitle data, is provided in the playlist PlayList as shown in FIG. 5B.<br>
Particularly, like FIG. 4B, in the case of FIG. 5B, all cases arc possible, in which the Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the common information area in the playlist PlayList, or the Playable_PID_cntriesO is provided to the playitem PlayItem only for the main data and the Virtual Playable_PID_entries() including subtitle reproduction managing information is provided in the common information area of the playlist PlayList<br>
In relation to above, details of the data structures Playable_PID_entries0 and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO will be described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 7A-7D.<br>
FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate third embodiments of the data structure for managing reproduction of the data streams recorded on the recording medium. Here, the subtitle data (as an example of supplemental data) linked with a main data for a plurality of subtitles is stored as independent subtitle stream files respectively, and reproduction of the subtitle stream files is managed using corresponding sub-playitems.<br>
For example, FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate a playitem PlayItem in the playlist PlayList includes reproduction managing information for reproducing the main data, and<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
10<br>
the sub-playitems SubPlayItem 1 and SubPlayItem 2 include reproduction managing information for reproducing the subtitle stream files Subtitle Clip 1 and 2, respectively, for two subtitles in the languages of Korean and English, respectively.<br>
As further shown, there is a Playable_PID_entries0 data structure for providing reproducible main data and subtitle information to the user as reproduction managing information in the playitem PlayItem for the main data, and in the sub-play items SubPlayIteml and SubPlayItem 2 for the respective subtitle data. FIG. 6B further illustrates that the playlist PlayList may include the data structure Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 for managing reproduction of both the main and subtitle data.<br>
Particularly, in the case of FIG. 6B, all cases are possible, in which the Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitems SubPlayIteml and SubPlayItem2 and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the common information area in the playlist PlayList, or the Playable_PID_entries0 is provided to the playrtem PlayItem only for the main data and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 including subtitle reproduction managing information in the common information area is provided in the playlist PlayList<br>
In relation to above, details of the data structures Playable_PED_entries0 and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO will be described in detail below with respect to FIGS. 7A-7D.<br>
Principal characteristics of the present invention notable in the first to third embodiments can be summarized as follows.<br>
First, the definition that the main data and the subtitle (supplementary data) form separate individual files permits, not only a case when the supplementary data, such as the subtitle, can be recorded on the optical disc, but also to utilize an external file of the optical disc by means of download, and the like in the future.<br>
Second, though the main data and the subtitle (supplementary data) related to<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
11<br>
each other are managed under the same file information, for an example, the playlist PlayList file, taking a variety of the subtitle (supplementary data) into account, the main data and the subtitle data are separated into a playitem PlayItem and sub-playitem SubPlayItem in recording the reproduction managing information. Therefore, even in a case where the supplementary data related to die main data exists in a variety of forms other than the subtitle, expansive application of this supplemental data becomes easy according to the present invention.<br>
The introduction of the reproduction managing information independent from the main data, such as Playable_PID_entries0 and Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0, into the management information for the subtitle (supplementary data) permits more effective reproduction management of the subtitle.<br>
In relation to above, the Playable_PID_entries() and Virrual_Playable_PID_cntries0 data structures mentioned in the first to third embodiments as reproduction managing information will be described in detail below.<br>
FIG. 7A illustrates the Playable_PID_entries0 data structure for a playitem and a sub-playitcm in detail. As shown, the Playable_PID_entries0 data structure for both the playitem and the sub-playitem includes a number_of_PID_entries field indicating the number of PID entries m the data structure. For each of the number of PID entries, both data structures provide a ref_to_stream_PID(k) field and an attributes field. The ref_to_stream_PID(k) field provides the PID of the data packets for the data stream. For example, when in the playitem PlayItem, the PID of the main AV stream is provided. When in the sub-playitem Sub-PlayItem, the PID is the PID of a supplemental data stream.<br>
Accordingly, since all the main AV streams managed by playitems are recorded on the MPEG2 TS format, the reproduction management can be made adequately with the ref_to_stream_PlD(k) field within the Playable_PID_entries0 included in the playitem information PlayItemQ.<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KR2004/002616<br>
12<br>
However, as described before, the supplemental data, such as certain types of subtitle data, may not be recorded in the MPEG2 TS format As a result, there is no "PID" in the subtitle data, and reproduction of the subtitle with the ref_to_ stream_PID(k) field is not possible. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 7A, the Playable_PID_entries() data structure for the sub-playitem Sub_PlayItem may include a sub-playitem number Sub_PlayItem_num or a relevant clip file name Clip_file_name, or Text_subtitle_file_name field, etc. to identify the appropriate clip file for reproduction of<br>
' supplemental data.<br>
FIGS. 7B and 7C illustrate detailed structures of the Playable_PED_entriesO and the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO data structures. FIG. 7B illustrates an embodiment where the Playable_PED_entriesO data structure is provided for the playitcm PlayItem of a playlist PlayLlst, but not for a sub-playitem SubPlayItem. Here, the Playable_PED_entriesO data structure for the playitcm PlayItem is the same as discussed above with respect to FIG. 7A. FIG. 7C illustrates an embodiment where the<br>
" Playable_PED_entries0data structure' is provided for both the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem. Here, the Playable_PID_entrics0 data structures for the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem are the same as discussed above with respect to FIG. 7A.<br>
FIGS. 7B and 7C also illustrates the Virtual_Playable_PID_entries0 data structure. This data structure has the same fields as described above with respect to the PlayableJPID_entriesO data structures for the sub-playitem SubPlayItem. However, the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO data structure provides the PIDs for the supplemental data streams and the main data stream. Namely, the Virtual_Playable_PID_entriesO data structure provides the same information as the Playable_PH)_entriesO data structure for both the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem. As such, the Virtual_Playablc_PID_entriesO data structure defines a list of the main data stream and each supplemental data stream for selection by a reproducing apparatus during<br><br>
WO 2005/067399	PCT/KJUOO4/002616<br>
13<br>
presentation of the playitem PlayItem and the sub-playitem SubPlayItem.<br>
According to this, the optical recording reproduction apparatus (FIG. 8) can reproduce the data streams more efficiently because the playlist file may provide the reproduction managing information Virtual_Playable_ PID_entries0 for the main and supplemental data streams. Furthermore, if the Playable.PED_entries() data structures arc provided in the playitem information PlayItemO or the sub-playitem information SubPlayItemO, reliability of this reproduction managing information will be enhanced.<br>
FIG. 7D illustrates a sub-playitem syntax in greater detail. As shown, the sub-playitem information SubPlayItemO has a field for designating the name of the clip information file Clip_information_file_name associated with the stream file to be reproduced, and provides a starting time SubPlayItem_In_time and an end time SubPlayItem_Out_time for reproducing the stream file indicated by the named clip information file. The sub-playitem also includes SubPlayItcm_type field for designating a kind of supplemental stream file managed by the sub-playitenx For example, if the supplemental data stream is an audio stream for browsable slide show this field is set to "2". Or if the supplemental data stream is a text subtitle, the type field is set to "3". Therefore, it is apparent that various kinds of supplementary data may be expanded on as the standardization process progresses.<br>
If the stream file managed by the sub-playitem is a subtitle ("SubPlayItemjype = 3"). then the sub-playitem may further include a Linking_Font_Info field The Linking_Font_Info information, related to the font of the subtitle, provides a Font_File_name, if the font files of possible fonts exist individually, or with a Font_pointer field that indicates a position of a font proper to the subtitle in a font file, if there is only one'font file.<br>
FIG. 8 is a detailed block diagram of an optical recording and reproducing apparatus according to the present invention. As shown, the apparatus includes a pickup unit 11 reading out management information and   data recorded in an optical disk, a<br><br>

servo 14 controlling the operation of the pickup unit 11, a signal processing unit 13 restoring a playback signal received from the pickup unit 11 into a wanted signal value or modulating a signal to be recorded in the optical disk, a memory 15 temporarily storing the management information such as the sound information and sound data as discussed above, and a microcomputer 16 controlling the operation of the servo 14, the signal processing unit 13 and the memory 15. The above discussed elements of the optical recording and reproducing apparatus may be called a recording and reproducing portion.<br>
In relation to above, in the present invention, the memory 15 represents various storage means (RAM, buffer, and the like) that may exist in the optical recording and reproduction apparatus, and it is apparent that the memory 15 may be replaced with a plurality of different storage means.<br>
An AV decoder 17 decodes output data according to the control of the control unit 12 to provide the decoded data to a user. In order to perform a function of recording a signal in the optical disk, an AV encoder 18 converts an input signal to a specifically formatted signal such as an MPEG2 transport stream according to the control of the control unit 12, and provides the converted signal to the signal processing unit 13 of the record playback system 20.<br>
The control unit 12, which is an element for controlling operations of the apparatus such as discussed in detail above, controls the record playback system 20 (and more specifically, the elements therein). For example the control unit 12 controls the read out of the sub-playitem information that manages the subtitle in response to a user's order for reproducing a particular subtitle, and reproduces the subtitle according to the subtitle reproduction management information included in the read sub-playitem information. More specifically, the control unit 12 determines if the subtitle is reproducible by using the subtitle reproduction managing information Playable_PID_entricsO or Virtual_ PlayableJPH)_entriesQ stored on the memory temporarily, reads font of the subtitle if the subtitle is reproducible, and controls<br><br>
