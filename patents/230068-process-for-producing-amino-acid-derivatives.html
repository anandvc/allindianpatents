The present invention relates to a process for producing amino acid derivatives.<br>
Some amino acids and their derivatives are useful in the context of the production of peptides which can be used as medicinal products.<br>
In the search for active principles, it is desirable to have amino acids which participate in the pharmacological activity in particular of peptides and which can be used in the process for producing peptides or peptide analogues.<br>
US patent 3,891,616 describes some biologically active peptides containing 2-pyrrolidineacetic acid. The N-Boc derivative of this acid is prepared by treatment of natural L-proline with diazomethane.<br>
This known process requires the use of a natural amino acid as starting product. The latter is subjected to conversions with a dangerous reagent under conditions which may involve a risk of racemization.<br>
The invention is aimed at remedying the abovementioned problems.<br>
The invention consequently relates to a process for producing amino acid derivatives, in which<br>
(a)	an organic amine, the amino functionality of which is protected, or an cc-amino acid, the amino functionality of which is protected, is subjected to an electrochemical reaction so as to form an amine which is activated in the a-position;<br>
(b)	the activated amine is subjected to a reaction with a carbanionic reagent containing at least 3 carbon atoms and comprising an unsaturated group so as to form an unsaturated amine comprising an unsaturated group, the atom of the unsaturated group closest to the nitrogen being separated from the nitrogen by at least 2 carbon atoms;<br>
(c)	the unsaturated amine is subjected to oxidation of the unsaturated group so as to form an amino acid derivative.<br>
It has been found, surprisingly, that the process according to the invention enables efficient production of a large variety of amino acid derivatives. The initial protective group is stable under the conditions of steps (a) to (c) and is particularly useful for subsequent conversions such as racemate separation or peptide synthesis.<br><br>
By way of nonlimiting examples of amino function-protecting groups which may be represented by Z, mention may in particular be made of substituted or unsubstituted groups of acyl type, such as the formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl or benzoyl group, substituted or unsubstituted groups of aralkyloxycarbonyl type, such as the benzyloxycarbonyl, p-chlorobenzyl-oxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, benzhydryloxycarbonyl, 2-(p-biphenylyl)isopropyloxycarbonyl, 2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)isopropyl-oxycarbonyl, p-phenylazobenzyloxycarbonyl, triphenylphosphonoethyl-oxycarbonyl or 9-fluorenylmeth.yloxycarbonyl group, substituted or unsubstituted groups of alkyloxycarbonyl type, such as the tert-butyloxy carbonyl, tert-amyloxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethyloxycarbonyl, isopropyloxycarbonyl, ethyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl, 2-methylsulphonyl-ethyloxycarbonyl or 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxycarbonyl group, groups of cycloalkyloxycarbonyl type, such as the cyclopentyloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl, adamantyloxycarbonyl or isobomyloxycarbonyl group, and groups containing a hetero atom, such as the benzenesulphonyl, p-toluenesulphonyl (tosyl), mesitylenesulphonyl, methoxytrimethylphenylsulphonyl or o-nitrophenylsulphenyl group.<br>
Among these groups Z, those containing a carbonyl or sulphonyl group are . preferred. Acyl, aralkyloxycarbonyl and alkyloxycarbonyl groups are more particularly preferred. Among the acyl groups, an acetyl or phenylacetyl group or the like is particularly preferred. Groups similar to the phenylacetyl group are, for example, chosen from/?-hydroxyphenylacetyl,/?-aminophenylacetyl, furylmethyl, 2-thienylmethyl, D-a-aminobenzyl, cbloroacetyl and n-propoxymethyl.<br>
Preferably, the protective group is sterically hindering. The term "sterically hindering" is intended to denote in particular a substituent containing at least 3 carbon atoms, in particular at least 4 carbon atoms, including at least one secondary, tertiary or quaternary carbon atom. Often, the sterically hindering group contains at most 100, or even 50 carbon atoms. A protective group chosen from the alkoxycarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl and aralkoxycarbonyl group is preferred. A tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) group is most particularly preferred.<br>
The protective group is preferably achiral or racemic.<br>
In a first embodiment of the process according to the invention, the reaction of step (a) is carried out in the presence of the carbanionic reagent<br><br>
containing at least 3 carbon atoms and an unsaturated group so as to directly form an unsaturated amine comprising the unsaturated group. In this embodiment, allyltrialkylsilanes, in particular allyltrimethylsilane, are preferred as carbanionic reagent. Good results are obtained in the absence of substitution catalysts.<br>
In a second embodiment of the process according to the invention, the activated amine is obtained by electrochemical reaction in the presence of a nucleophile so as to form an amine substituted in the a-position with the nucleophilic substituent, as activated amine, and step (b) is preferably carried out in the presence of a substitution catalyst. The nucleophile is often chosen from an alcohol and a carboxylic acid. It is preferably chosen from methanol and acetic acid. Methanol is more particularly preferred.<br>
In this embodiment, a Lewis acid is often used as substitution catalyst. The substitution catalyst is preferably a titanium or boron compound. Titanium tetrachloride and boron trifluoride etherate are particularly preferred.<br>
In the process according to the invention, step (a) can be carried out in a compartmentalized or non-compartmentalized cell.<br>
The electrodes used in step (a) should be resistant with respect to the conditions of the electrochemical reaction. Suitable materials are in particular chosen from metals, metal oxides and graphite. Particularly suitable metals are chosen from steel, iron and titanium, and in particular from the metals of the group of platinum and their oxides, or electrodes coated with the latter materials. Platinum or rhodium is preferred. An electrode comprising platinum is particularly suitable.<br>
The distance between the electrodes is generally at least 0.2 mm. This distance is often at least 0.5 mm. It is preferably at least 1 mm. The distance between the electrodes is generally at most 20 mm. This distance is often at most 10 mm. It is preferably at most 5 mm.<br>
In the process according to the invention, step (a) is generally carried out at a current density greater than or equal to 0.1 A/dm2. The current density is often greater than or equal to 1 A/dm2. It is preferably greater than or equal to 3 A/dm2. In the process according to the invention, step (a) is generally carried out at a current density less than or equal to 50 A/dm2. The current density is often less than or equal to 30 A/dm2. It is preferably less than or equal to 20 A/dm2.<br><br>
In ±c process according to the invention, step (a) is generally carried out at a temperature greater than or equal to -50°C. The temperature is often greater than or equal to -20°C. It is preferably greater than or equal to 0°C. In the process according to the invention, step (a) is generally carried out at a temperature less than or equal to 100°C. The temperature is often less than or equal to 30°C. It is preferably less than or equal to 60°C.<br>
In the process according to the invention, an allyl carbanionic reagent is often used in step (b).<br>
In a first variant of the process according to the invention, the unsaturated amine comprises a carbonyl group as unsaturated group. Such unsaturated amines can be obtained, for example, when a silyl enol ether, in particular a trialkylsilyl enol ether, is used as carbanionic reagent. Trialkylsilyl enol ethers of formula<br>
H2C=C(OSi(alkyl)3)-R    (I) in which R denotes an alkyl, preferably sterically hindering, group or an aryl group are preferred.<br>
In a second variant of the process according to the invention, the unsaturated amine comprises an olefin double bond as unsaturated group.<br>
In this variant, an allyltrialkylsilane is preferably used as carbanionic reagent. Allyltrimethylsilane is more particularly preferred.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the oxidation can, for example, be oxidation with periodate, preferably catalyzed by a metal such as ruthenium, or ozonolysis or else, when the unsaturated amine comprises a carbonyl group, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, for example with a peracid such as peracetic acid or trifluoroperacetic acid. Oxidative cleavage by ozonolysis is particularly preferred.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for producing enantiopure amino acid derivatives, comprising the steps:<br>
(a)	a racemic amino acid derivative is produced according to the process of the invention;<br>
(b)	the enantiomers of the racemic amino acid derivative are separated.<br>
In this process, the separation of the enantiomers can be carried out, for example, by enzymatic reaction. Suitable enzymes are chosen, for example, from oxydoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. Enzymatic reaction with a penicillinase or a lipase is preferred.<br><br>
Mere particularly preferably, the process according to the invention is applied to the production of a P-amino acid derivative, in particular an enantiopure P-amino acid derivative. The process according to the invention can also be used to obtain other amino acids exhibiting a greater distance between the amino group and the carboxyl group, such as y- 5- or e-amino acids. The process according to the invention is suitable for obtaining cyclic or acyclic amino acids, it being possible for the amino group to be present within a heterocycle. The process is particularly suitable for the manufacture of acyclic aminoacides, in particularly when a penicillinase is used to separate enantiomers.<br>
Specific examples of amino acids which can be obtained according to the process according to the invention are chosen, for example, from p-homovaline, P-homophenylalanine, e-trifluoroacetyl-p-homolysine, P-homolysine, P-homoaspartic acid, P-homoproline, pyrrolidine-2-acetic acid and 2-piperidineacetic acid.<br>
The examples below are intended to illustrate the invention without, however, limiting it.<br>
Example 1<br><br>
1.81 ml of triethylamine (13 mmol, 0.15 equiv.) were added to a solution of 20 g of jV-phenylacetylated valine (85 mmol, 1 equiv.) in 80 ml of methanol. The mixiaire was cooled to around 5°C by circulating ice-cold water around the electrode:. A current of 2.8 A for a voltage of + 10 V was then applied for a period of time corresponding to two faradays, followed by a current of 1.4 A for the period of time corresponding to 0.2 faraday. The reaction was monitored by HPLC. After concentration on a rotary evaporator, the residue was diluted in 150 ml of dichloromethane and the solution was washed with 150 ml of a 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The aqueous phase was extracted twice with 100 ml of dichloromethane. The organic phases were pooled, washed with<br><br>
150 ml of brine, and dried with magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated. Recrystallization of the brown-coloured crude product from an equimolar ethyl acetate/isooctane mixture gave 17.5 g of a white solid corresponding to the expected product (chemical yield: 93%; electrical yield: 91%).<br>
