Method for defining the toothing geometries<br>
of a gear pair comprising two gears<br>
with intersecting axes<br>
The present invention relates to a method for defining the<br>
toothing geometries of a gear pair comprising two gears with<br>
intersecting axes, especially a gear pair comprising crown gear<br>
and pinion. The present invention also relates to a gear pair<br>
comprising crown gear and pinion with toothings of mutually<br>
conjugate form.<br>
In the prior art, there has been widely used, to define the<br>
geometries of the toothings of a gear pair comprising crown gear<br>
and pinion, a method based on numerical design, wherein the exact;<br>
geometry of one of the partners of the gear pair is predosiqnated<br>
and a complete cycle of rolling of the pinion over the crown gear<br>
is simulated, whereby the geometry of the toothing of the other<br>
partner of the gear pair can be defined. This method is known as<br>
"conjugate generation". A good overview of the related prior art<br>
can be found in the book entitled "Development of Gear Technology<br>
and Theory of Gearing." by Faydor L. Litvin, NASA (National<br>
Aeronautics and Space Administration) from 1997. A gear pair<br>
comprising crown gear and pinion or two bevel-toothed gears and<br>
defined in this way can then be generated by means of" known chip-<br>
removing and/or forming manufacturing methods from the knowledge<br>
of the exact toothing geometries of both gears. For this purpose,<br>
however, the toothing geometry of one of the partners of the gear<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
2<br>
pair must always be predesignated exactly.<br>
According to the known prior art, cylindrical geometry of the<br>
pinion toothing, wherein the tooth flanks of the pinion teeth<br>
have a linear shape over the axial width of the teeth, is usually<br>
assumed in the case of a gear pair comprising crown gear and<br>
pinion.<br>
To define advantageous toothing geometries of a gear pair<br>
comprising crown gear and pinion, however, there has also boon<br>
proposed already for the pinion teeth a more complex geometry, in<br>
which the standard cylindrical toothing geometry is abandoned in<br>
order to reduce the undercut that would otherwise develop at. the<br>
tooth flanks of the crown-gear teeth. For example, it has been<br>
proposed for this purpose that the tooth-flank load-bearing<br>
capacity of the crown-gear teeth be improved by providing the<br>
pinion teeth with a pressure-angle and/or profile-displacement<br>
variation over the axial width thereof. In this connection, an<br>
undercut of the crown-gear teeth can also be further reduced<br>
advantageously with a tip shortening that increases over the<br>
axial width of the pinion teeth. Here also the tooth flanks of<br>
the pinion teeth have a geometry that is always characterized by<br>
a linear shape in axial direction.<br>
The method of conjugate generation has already proved to be less<br>
than optimal for defining the aforesaid more complex toothing<br>
geometries, since the exact geometry of one of the partners of<br>
the gear pair must already be known for this purpose in each<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
3<br>
case. Thus optimization and definition of the toothing geometry<br>
frequently necessitate numerous computing runs, in order to<br>
approximate the desired geometric characteristics by varying the<br>
most diverse toothing parameters of a gear pair.<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for defining the toothing geometries of a gear pair<br>
comprising two gears with intersecting axes, especially a gear<br>
pair comprising crown gear and pinion, wherein optimal toothing<br>
geometries for crown gear and pinion can be defined with low<br>
computational effort to achieve the greatest; possible tooth-flank<br>
load-bearing capacity of the crown-gear teeth and the highest<br>
possible operating strength of the toothing on the whole. Another<br>
object is to provide a gear pair comprising crown gear and<br>
pinion, wherein the toothing geometries of mutually conjugate<br>
form are advantageously superior to the prior art in terms of<br>
operating strength of the gear pair.<br>
This object is achieved for a gear pair comprising two gears with<br>
beveled toothing by a method according to independent claims 1 or<br>
2. Although the inventive method - subject to certain secondary<br>
conditions - is suitable for arbitrary gear pairs with<br>
intersecting axes, the method and its advantages will be<br>
explained hereinafter on the basis of the embodiment according to<br>
claim 3, according to which the gear pair is one comprising crown<br>
gear and pinion having axes that intersect at an angle of 90°.<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
4<br>
According to the invention, there is first predesignated a first<br>
toothing geometry of a "virtual" pinion, which is intended to<br>
serve as the starting basis for the subsequent steps of<br>
calculating and defining the toothings. Starting from this<br>
predesignated toothing geometry of the virtual pinion, there is<br>
calculated the toothing geometry of a "virtual" crown gear that<br>
results from a cycle of rolling of the virtual pinion in<br>
conjugate generation. In a departure from the prior art method of<br>
conjugate generation, only a "half" rolling cycle of the virtual<br>
pinion is used as basis instead of a complete rolling cycle,<br>
which introduced an undercut of the tooth flanks of the crown<br>
gear. For this purpose, the calculation of the tooth-flank<br>
geometry of the virtual crown gear resulting from the rolling<br>
cycle is ended at the point at which the tooth of the virtual<br>
pinion used as reference for calculating the tooth flanks during<br>
the rolling cycle is in the symmetric position in the tooth gap<br>
of the virtual crown gear. Because of the early termination of<br>
conjugate generation, there is calculated in this way the<br>
geometry of a tooth flank of a tooth of a virtual crown gear on<br>
which the predesignated virtual pinion tooth can roll halfway.<br>
Thereby the calculated tooth flank is mathematically represented<br>
as the envelope of the virtual pinion tooth after it has rolled<br>
halfway. The corresponding mating flank is then generated either<br>
by reflecting the half-rolled, undercut-free tooth flank or by<br>
assuming a further half rolling cycle in opposite running<br>
direction. The two tooth flanks of each tooth of the virtual<br>
crown gear then have mutually symmetric geometry - starting from<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
5<br>
a toothing geometry of the virtual pinion that is symmetrically<br>
predesignated for both running directions. It is expressly<br>
pointed out that the predesignated virtual pinion cannot roll<br>
completely on the calculated virtual crown gear.<br>
Starting from the toothing geometry of the virtual crown gear, in<br>
which, by virtue of the underlying calculation procedure using<br>
only half of a rolling cycle, the tooth flanks do not have any<br>
undercut, the geometry of both tooth flanks of a pinion tooth<br>
satisfying the toothing law is then calculated by means of<br>
reverse conjugate generation. In the process, it is possible; that<br>
excessive tapering of the (separately) calculated tooth flanks of<br>
the pinion may occur in the region of the pinion toothing located<br>
at the radially inner end - relative to the revo.Luti.on of.' the<br>
pinion on the crown gear, meaning that the two tooth flanks of: a<br>
pinion tooth intersect. In this case the region of: the two tooth<br>
flanks located above the line of intersection - relative to the<br>
height of the tooth - is technically meaningless; the resulting<br>
excessive tapering is avoided with appropriate shortening of the<br>
tooth flanks, resulting in a corresponding shortening of the<br>
tooth tip. The pinion-toothing geometry obtained in this way is<br>
then defined as the final geometry of the pinion toothing. In<br>
extremely advantageous manner, a pinion tooth created in this way<br>
therefore has a tip shortening at the radially inner end relative<br>
to its revolution on the crown gear; in contrast to the pinion<br>
toothings known heretofore, whose tooth flanks have axiaU.y<br>
linear shape, the tooth flanks of the pinion tooth having the<br>
geometry defined with the inventive method have a shape that is<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
6<br>
not linear over the entire axial width but instead is curved.<br>
According to the first variant of the method according to claim<br>
1, the toothing geometry of the virtual crown gear can then be<br>
defined as the final geometry of the crown-gear toothing. The<br>
pinion, whose geometry has already been finally defined, was<br>
; indeed obtained directly from reverse conjugate generation, and<br>
so, according to the invention, two mutually conjugate gears have<br>
been defined.<br>
Alternatively, as the last step of the inventive method according<br>
to claim 2, and starting from the pinion whose geometry was<br>
finally defined on the basis of a complete pinion rolling cycle,<br>
there can be calculated, by means of conjugate generation, the<br>
geometry of a crown-gear toothing; this is then defined as the<br>
final geometry of the crown-gear toothing. This last step is used<br>
as it were to check the previous calculation steps, since the<br>
resulting and defined geometry of the crown-gear toothing must<br>
correspond substantially to that of the previously calculated<br>
virtual crown gear.<br>
The net effect according to the invention is therefore that the<br>
toothing geometry of a gear pair comprising crown gear and pinion<br>
has been defined in a manner that completely avoids an undercut<br>
of the tooth flanks of the crown gear. The tooth flanks of the<br>
crown gear teeth, whose geometry has been optimally defined by<br>
the method, have high load-bearing capacity. The pinion teeth -<br>
and therefore the gear pair as a whole - have been advantageously<br>
designed for the greatest possible operating strength, especially<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
7<br>
by virtue of the fact that their tooth flanks are curved in axial<br>
direction.<br>
Obviously the method is not limited merely to defining the<br>
geometry of a gear pair comprising crown gear and pinion. To the<br>
contrary, as already mentioned hereinabove, it can be applied for<br>
arbitrary gear pairs with intersecting axes, if an undercut that:<br>
may develop on one of the two gears is to be avoided. In<br>
particular, the method' can therefore also be applied to gear<br>
pairs in which the gear axes intersect at an angle different from<br>
90°. Even in such cases the inventive method permits rapid and<br>
optimal definition of the toothing geometries that are<br>
advantageous for the purpose.<br>
In a further preferred configuration of the inventive method, the<br>
pinion-toothing geometry to be predesignated has a constant tooth<br>
height as well as a variation of the pressure angle and/or of the<br>
profile displacement over the axial width of the teeth. Such a<br>
pinion-toothing geometry, which is already advantageous and<br>
deviates from the cylindrical tooth form that has been standard<br>
heretofore, is therefore further optimized in extremely<br>
advantageous manner. The tip shortening developing on the pinion<br>
is advantageously limited to the minimum extent necessary to<br>
avoid an undercut.<br>
Particularly advantageously, the method is applied to a gear pair<br>
comprising crown gear and pinion with an axis intersection angle<br>
of 90°, wherein there is no axis offset between crown gear and<br>
pinion and the pinion has straight toothing. A gear pair<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
8<br>
exhibiting the aforesaid characteristics is preferably suitable<br>
precisely as a component of a differential gear mechanism<br>
subjected to high loads, in which case the gear pair needs<br>
advantageously optimal characteristics in terms of its operating<br>
strength. However, this should not be construed as a limitation,<br>
since the present method is also applicable in particular to<br>
crown-gear/pinion pairs with helical toothing.<br>
Finally, the present invention also relates to a gear pa.i r<br>
comprising crown gear and pinion with toothings of mutually<br>
conjugate form, characterized in that the pinion teeth have, over<br>
their width, a tip shortening that increases radially inward<br>
relative to the revolution of the pinion on the crown gear, while<br>
the tooth flanks of the pinion teeth are curved over their width.<br>
This gear pair is therefore characterized by those features that<br>
appear in the inventive method; it is distinguished from the<br>
already known prior art in extremely advantageous manner, by the<br>
fact that the pinion teeth have an increasing tip shortening over<br>
their axial width as well as a curved shape of their tooth<br>
flanks.<br>
Starting from the curved shape of the tooth flanks of the pinion<br>
teeth over the axial tooth width and from the tip shortening<br>
found at the radially inner end relative to the revolution of the<br>
pinion on the crown gear, a gear pair optimized in terms of high<br>
operating strength is obtained by conjugate generation of the<br>
crown-gear toothing. According to an advantageous embodiment of<br>
the inventive gear pair, it can then be further provided that the<br><br>
WO 2006/082038	PCT/EP2006/000874<br>
9<br>
tooth flanks of the crown gear bear load over their full surface<br>
and thus do not have any undercut. The advantageous effects of<br>
the unnecessary undercut on the tooth-flank load-bearing capacity<br>
of the crown-gear teeth are evident.<br>
A practical example of the inventive method and of the .inventive<br>
gear pair comprising crown gear and pinion will be explained in<br>
more detail hereinafter on the basis of the drawing, wherein<br>

Fig. la shows a schematic perspective diagram of a tooth 1 of the<br>
virtual pinion, whose geometry is predesignated in connection<br>
with execution of a practical example of the inventive method.<br>
The two tooth flanks 2 of illustrated virtual pinion tooth ] have<br>
mutually symmetric form, and can have, for example, a decreasing<br>
profile displacement and an increasing pressure ang.le over their<br>
axial width. The limit conditions known for a pinion/crown-gcar<br>
toothing, such as the taper limit and the interference Limit, are<br>
advantageously met in this way.<br>
Fig. lb) then shows a schematic perspective diagram of a tooth<br>
gap 3 obtained between two adjacent teeth of the virtual crown<br>
gear by simulation of a half rolling cycle of the virtual pinion<br>
according to Fig. la. The two tooth flanks 4 bounding tooth gap 3<br>
of the crown-gear toothing have mutually symmetric form and do<br>
not have any undercut, since the rolling cycle on which the<br>
calculation is based was ended when tooth 1 of the virtual, pinion<br>
reached its symmetry position in- tooth gap 3 of the toothing of<br>
the virtual crown gear.<br>
Fig. lc then shows a schematic view of the tooth flanks 6 of a<br>

generation and exhibit excessive taper 7. This technically<br>
meaningless crossover of tooth flanks 6 is avoided by shortening<br>
tooth flanks 6 in the region of excessive taper 7.<br>
Fig. Id shows the resulting pinion tooth 8, whose geometry .is<br>
defined as the final geometry of the pinion toothing. Tip<br>
shortening 10 is clearly evident. The resulting tooth flanks 9<br>
have been shortened relative to tooth flanks 6 in the region of<br>
excessive taper 7. Starting from this pinion tooth, the geometry<br>
of a crown-gear toothing is then calculated by means of conjugate<br>
generation. A tooth gap 11 of this toothing is schematicaily<br>
illustrated in Fig. le, together with the two tooth flanks 12 of<br>
two adjacent crown-gear teeth bounding the tooth gap. Finally,<br>
this crown-gear toothing geometry, which substantially coincides<br>
with that of Fig. 1b, is defined as the final geometry.<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 then show diagrams of a pinion and crown-gear tooth<br>
respectively of a practical example of an inventive gear pair,<br>
whose toothing geometries were defined according to the method<br>
explained hereinabove.<br>
In the diagram at top center, Fig. 2 shows a side view of a tooth<br>

method can be clearly recognized on pinion tooth 8.<br><br>

sections A-A, B-B, C-C, D-D and E-E according to the section<br>
planes indicated in the side view. The shaded area in sections A-<br>
A to E-E represents the part of tooth 8 located in the respective<br>
section plane. Over their axial width, which is oriented from<br>
left to right in the respective sections, the tooth flanks of<br>
pinion tooth 8 are not straight but instead are curved, as is<br>
evident in particular from the clearly recognizable (convex)<br>
bulge in the region of the tooth tip in sections A-A and B-B.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen from the overhead view of the tooth<br>
(view L) that the tooth flanks are also slightly curved in the<br>
region of the tooth root, whose shape is evident from the upper<br>
and lower bounding lines of view L, although in this case the<br>
tooth flanks have the form not of a bulge but rather of a slight<br>
(concave) indentation.<br>
To the right and below the side view of tooth 8 there is further<br>
illustrated a view of tooth 8 according to arrow K of the side<br>
view. Tip shortening 10 can be clearly recognized here also.<br>
Thereunder there are presented diagrams of sections F-F to J-J<br>
through tooth 8, wherein the part of tooth 8 located in the<br>
respective section plane is again highlighted by shading.<br>

toothing has a form conjugate to that of the pinion toothing<br>

comprising two gears with intersecting axes, wherein the<br>
method includes the following steps:<br>
predesignating a first toothing geometry of a virtual<br>
first gear;<br>
calculating the toothing geometry of a virtual second<br>
gear of the gear pair that results in conjugate<br>
generation from a cycle of rolling of a tooth (1)<br>
having the predesignated geometry of the virtual first<br>
gear, wherein the cycle of rolling of the tooth (1) of<br>
the virtual first gear on which the calculation is<br>
based is ended in its symmetric position in the tooth<br>
gap (3) of the second virtual gea re;<br>
calculating the tooth-flank geometry of the teeth of<br>
the first gear that result from reverse conjugate<br>
generation on the basis of a complete cycle of roil ing<br>
of a tooth of the virtual second gear with the fi rst<br>
gear, wherein any resulting excessive taper (7) is<br>
avoided by reduction of the tooth flanks in this<br>
region;<br>
defining the final geometry of the toothing of the<br>
first gear in a manner corresponding to the tooth-flank<br>
geometry of the toothing of the first gear calculated<br>
in the previous step;<br>
calculating the tooth-flank geometry of the teeth of<br>
the second gear that results by conjugate generation<br>
from a complete cycle of rolling of the first gear<br>
having the defined geometry;<br>

16<br>
second gear in a manner corresponding to the tooth-<br>
flank geometry of the toothing of the second gear<br>
calculated in the previous step.<br>
3.	A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in<br>
that the first gear is a pinion and the second gear is a<br>
crown gear, wherein the axes intersect at an angle of 90°.<br>
4.	A method according to claim 3, characterized :i n that; the<br>
predesignated toothing geometry of the virtual pinion has a<br>
constant tooth height as well as a variation of the pressure<br>
angle and/or of the profile displacement over the axial,<br>
width of the teeth.<br>
5.	A gear pair comprising crown gear and pinion, wherein t;he<br>
toothings of crown gear and pinion have mutually conjugate<br>
form and the tooth flanks (9) of the pinion teeth are curved<br>
over their width, characterized in that the pinion teeth (8)<br>
have, over their width, a tip shortening (10) that increases<br>
radially inward relative to the revolution of the pinion on<br>
the crown gear.<br>
6.	A gear pair comprising crown gear and pinion according to<br>
claim 4, characterized in that the tooth flanks of the crown<br>
gear (12) are fully load-bearing, and an undercut is<br>
completely avoided.<br><br>
A method for establishing the gearing geometries of a gear pairing of two gears with intersecting axes comprises the<br>
following steps: predetermining a first gearing geometry of a virtual first gear; calculating the geometry of the gearing of a virtual<br>
second gear, this geometry resulting during conjugated creation from a roll-off process of a tooth (1) of the predetermined geometry<br>
of the virtual first gear, whereby the roll-off process of the tooth (1) of the virtual first gear, this roll-off process underlying the<br>
calculation, is ended in the symmetrical position thereof in the tooth gap (3) of the second virtual tooth; calculating the tooth face<br>
geometry of the teeth of the first gear, this tooth face geometry resulting during the reverse conjugated creation, while underlying<br>
a full roll-off process of a tooth of the virtual second gear with the first; establishing the final geometry of the gearing of the first<br>
gear according to the tooth face geometry of the gearing of the first gear, this tooth face geometry having been calculated in the<br>
previous step, and; establishing the final geometry of the gearing of the second gear according to the previously calculated tooth face<br>
geometry of the gearing of the virtual second gearing. <br></td>
