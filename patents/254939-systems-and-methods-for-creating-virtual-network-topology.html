TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The invention relates to distributed computing systems and distributed<br>
applications that run on the distributed computing systems. More particularly, this<br>
invention relates to techniques for automatically creating arbitrary virtual network<br>
topologies from the physical distributed computing system to allow that system to host<br>
multiple distributed applications.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Internet usage has exploded over the past several years and continues to grow.<br>
People have become very comfortable with many services offered on the World Wide<br>
Web (or simply "Web"), such as electronic mail, online shopping, gathering news and<br>
information, listening to music, viewing video clips, looking for jobs, and so forth.   To<br>
keep  pace with the  growing  demand  for Intemet-based services,  there  has  been<br>
tremendous growth in the computer systems dedicated to hosting websites, providing<br>
backend services for those sites, and storing data associated with the sites.<br>
[0004] One type of distributed computer system is an Internet data center (IDC), which is<br>
a specifically designed complex that houses many computers for hosting Internet-based<br>
services.   IDCs, which also go by the names "Webfarms" and "server farms", typically<br>
house hundreds to thousands of computers in climate-controlled, physically secure<br>
buildings.  These computers are interconnected to run one or more programs supporting<br>
one or more Internet services or websites. IDCs provide reliable Internet access, reliable<br>
power  supplies,  and  a secure operating environment.  Another type of distributed<br>
computer system is an enterprise data centers (EDC). EDCs are similar to IDCs, but are<br>
targeted to the enterprise.<br>
3<br><br>
[0005] Fig. l shows an Internet data center 100. It has many server computers 102<br>
arranged in a specially constructed room. The computers are general-purpose computers,<br>
typically configured as servers. An Internet data center may be constructed to house a<br>
single site for a single entity (e.g., a data center for Yahoo! or MSN), or to accommodate<br>
multiple sites for multiple entities (e.g., an Exodus center that host sites for multiple<br>
companies).<br>
[0006] The IDC 100 is illustrated with three entities—entity A, entity B, and entity C—<br>
that share the computer resources. These entities represent various companies that want a<br>
presence on the Web. The IDC 100 has a pool of additional computers 104 that may be<br>
used by the entities at times of heavy traffic. For example, an entity engaged in online<br>
retailing may experience significantly more demand during the Christmas season. The<br>
additional computers give the EDC flexibility to meet mis demand.<br>
[0007] Today, large IDCs are complex and often called upon to host multiple<br>
applications. For instance, some websites may operate several thousand computers, and<br>
host many distributed applications. These distributed applications often have complex<br>
netwerking requirements that require operators to physically connect computers to certain<br>
network switches, as well as manually arrange the wiring configurations within the IDC<br>
to support the complex applications. As a result, this task of building physical network<br>
topologies to conform to the application requirements can be a cumbersome, time<br>
consuming process that is prone to human error. Accordingly, there is a need for<br>
improved techniques for designing and deploying distributed applications onto the<br>
physical computing system.<br>

SUMMARY<br>
[0008] An architecture and methodology for automatically creating arbitrary virtual<br>
network topologies from a physical computing system is described. The architecture and<br>
methodology allows automated and remote installation of multiple distributed<br>
applications on the same physical computing system without having to physically connect<br>
computers and configure wirings within the system.<br>
[0009] In one implementation, the distributed computing system is comprised of many<br>
computers interconnected via a network of switches (e.g., Ethernet switches). The<br>
computers may be programrned to perform various specific tasks called for by the<br>
application (e.g., Web servers, databases, load balancing, firewalls, bulk data storage,<br>
etc.). The methodology creates one or more virtual local area networks (VLANs) atop the<br>
physical network for each distributed application to be hosted on the distributed<br>
computing system. Computers used to host thé distributed applications are automatically<br>
connected to respective VLANs associated with the applications. The VLANs ensure that<br>
the applications operate in isolation from one another.<br>
[00010]	The automated connection of computers involves two operations.   The<br>
fïrst operation is the assignment of a VLAN membership to the switch port to which the<br>
computer is connected. This designates the switch port to accept packets tagged with the<br>
associated VLAN identity. The second operation is the creation of virtual network<br>
interfaces (VNICs) over the single physical network interface (NIC) at each computer.<br>
Each VNIC uniquely represents an associated VLAN, This allows a computer with a<br>
single physical NIC to participate in several VLANs. Packets associated with a particular<br>
5<br><br>
VLAN are routed to the computer and handled via the corresponding VNIC for that<br>
VLAN.<br>
[00011]	The  ability  to  create  virtual  network  topologies  allows  application<br>
architects to create essentially any type of network configuration automatically on the fly.<br>
For example, the architect can defïne isolation zones (i.e., "DMZs") by remotely<br>
allocating a firewall computer to a VLAN, assigning switches and adding servers to the<br>
VLAN within a given zone. Applications can then be deployed over the same computing<br>
system, where individual servers host multiple different applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[00019]	The   following   disclosure   describes   generation   of  virtual   network<br>
topologies for automated deployment of distributed software applications on physical<br>
computing resources. The ability to generate arbitrary virtual network topologies from a<br>
physical computing system enables creation of custom network topologies for every<br>
distributed application hosted on the same distributed computing system. This is<br>
particularly helpful for large datacenters, which are complex and often called upon to host<br>
multiple applications. Distributed applications installed at such datacenters often have<br>
complex netwerking requirements and building physical network topologies to conform<br>
to these requirements can be a cumbersome, time consuming process that is prone to<br>
human error. Enabling generation of virtual network topologies that does not require<br>
physical re-configuration of the computing system for each deployed application (e.g.,<br>
rerouting wiring, physically connecting computers to various switches, etc.) reduces the<br>
dependence on human-centric operations, thereby reducing cösts and the likelihood of<br>
human rror.<br>
[00020]	Distributed Computing Svstem<br>
Fig. 2 shows a distributed computing system 200 that can be automatically<br>
deployed as needed to support one or more distributed applications.   The distributed<br>
7<br><br>
computing system 200 includes a monolithic collection of many servers 202(1), 202(2),<br>
..., 202(N) interconnected via a network of switches 204. In one implementation, the<br>
network switches 204 are non-blocking Ethernet switches, although other types of<br>
switches may be used. The network 204 is illustrated as having multiple physical ports<br>
P1, P2, ..., PN to which the servers 202(1)-202(N) are respectively connected. The<br>
distributed computing system 200 further includes one or more load balancing computers<br>
206 and one or more firewall computers 208. Each of these computer types is shown<br>
connected to physical ports PN+1 and PN+2 of network switches 204. In addition to load<br>
balancers and firewalls, the distributed computing system may further include other types<br>
of special purpose devices, such as web caches, SSL (secure sockets layer) accelerators,<br>
NAS (network attached storage) devices, and so on.<br>
[00021]	The distributed computing system 200 is representative of the physical<br>
resources employed in a large-scale computing system, such as an Internet data center<br>
(IDC) that hosts Internet-based services, or more generally, a datacenter. An exemplary<br>
datacenter might consist of hundreds to thousands of computers interconnected by a local<br>
area network (LAN).<br>
[00022]	The distributed computing system 200 further includes one or more virtual<br>
network topology generation servers 210, which is illustrated as being coupled to the<br>
network switches 204 via physical port PN+S. This server 210 enables an application<br>
architect to create virtual network topologies from the distributed computing system 200<br>
so that multiple distributed applications can be hosted on the same system 200. A<br>
distributed application is a software program that is implemented on, and executed by,<br>
multiple networked computers. Examples of such applications include email services,<br>
8<br><br>
websites, content databases, online commerce, storage, news and information services,<br>
entertainment services, and so forth.<br>
[00023]	To generate a virtual netwerk topology, the server 210 creates at least one<br>
virtual local area network (VLAN) for each distributed application. The server 210 then<br>
directs selected servers .and associated switch ports to associate themselves with a<br>
particular VLAN. The virtual network topology generation server 210 runs one or more<br>
resource managers 212 that facilitate deployment of the physical resources to respective<br>
VLANs in support of the distributed applications. The resource manager(s) 212<br>
communicate with the servers 202, the network switches 204, load balancing computer(s)<br>
206, and the firewall computer(s) 208 to establish various VLANs so that associated<br>
applications can operate securely in isolation to one another. The resource manager(s)<br>
212 track creation and allocation of VLANs, as well as which computer(s) are connected<br>
to the VLANs. Such information can be kept in a database maintained by the resource<br>
manager(s) 212 at the virtual network topology generation server 210. The server 210<br>
also enables customization of an application's topology. For example, it can create<br>
isolation zones, or "DMZs", within an application to isolate critical components.<br>
[00024]	There are several ways in which virtual network topologies can be utilized.<br>
Virtual topology generation can be used, for example, to facilitate automation. Network<br>
topologies can be generated on demand without human intervention, as is described<br>
below in more detail. Virtual topology generation also allows the same physical network<br>
to host multiple applications in a secure manner, without applications interfering with<br>
another. Virtual topology generation allows an application architect to defme and enforce<br>
separate isolation zones that isolate portions of applications from other portions. Such<br>
9<br><br>
isolation zones can be constructed on the fly in very little time. Yet another possible use<br>
of virtual topology generation is to enable pooling of specialized hardware resources<br>
among multiple distributed applications. In Fig. 2, for example, a pool of load balancing<br>
computers can be defmed and connected at any point on the physical network. A load<br>
balancer can then be allocated from this pool and placed in an application's virtual<br>
network.<br>
[00025]	Prior to describing how a virtual network topology is generaled and an<br>
application  is  automatically  deployed onto  the physical  computing resources,  the<br>
following section addresses a platform architecture built atop the physical computing<br>
system.   The architecture provides the framework within which various pieces of the<br>
automated deployment and management functions can be developed.<br>
[00026]	Platform Architecture<br>
Fig. 3 shows a platform architecture 300 for automating design, deployment, and<br>
management of distributed applications on a distributed computing system 200. The<br>
architecture 300 shows multiple layers atop a base layer 302 that represents the physical<br>
computer resources of the distributed computing system 200. An automated deployment<br>
services layer 304 provides tools to convert machines into servers used in the distributed<br>
computing system 200. Such tools allow creation, editing, and deployment of OS<br>
(operating system) images. The remote programming of the machine is accomplished<br>
using fully programmatic interfaces, such as WMI (Windows Management<br>
Instrumentation), which is a programming interface (API) in Microsoft's Windows®<br>
operating systems that allows system and network devices to be confïgured and managed.<br>
10<br><br>
[00027]	A network management layer 306 sits atop the automated deployment<br>
services layer 304. The network management layer 306 allows for network management<br>
and virtual topology generation. In part, the network management layer supports a driver<br>
model for network computers that facilitates connection of individual computers to one or<br>
more VLANs via a single physical network interface connected to an associated port of<br>
the network switches 204. According to the driver model, a VLAN driver is installed at<br>
the server and used to create virtual network interfaces (VNICs) above the single physical<br>
network interface. The VLAN driver creates one virtual network interface (VNÏC) for<br>
each VLAN. The VNICs reside just above the network interface (NIC) in the IP stack at<br>
the server so that the server can handle packets passed over more than one VLAN, even<br>
though all packets physically travel through the same physical NIC. This is described in<br>
more detail below with respect to Fig. 6.<br>
[00028]	The driver model enables configuration of VLAN tagging on switch ports<br>
to allow data packets being passed over the distributed computing system to be tagged<br>
with identities of the VLAN to which they belong. The network switches 204 enforce the<br>
tagging and only accept packets with tags identifying the VLANs to which the switches<br>
belong. In one implementation, the network switches 204 have both tagged ports and<br>
non-tagged ports. Tagged ports of a switch are tagged with VLANs identifiers and used<br>
for connection to tagged ports of other switches. This allows rapid transfer of packets<br>
through the network of switches. Untagged ports of a switch are used for connection to<br>
the servers 202 or computers 206, 208. When packets reach their destination server's<br>
switch port, VLAN tags are stripped from the packets prior to communieating the packets<br>
upstream to the servers so that the servers need not know anything about the tagging.<br>
11<br><br>
[00029]	A physical resource management layer 308 resides atop the network<br>
management layer 306. The physical resource management layer 308 maintains a<br>
physical model of the distributed computing system 200, tracking ownership and<br>
coordinating allocation of all physical computing resources. The physical management<br>
layer 308 further supports batched resource allocation, thereby enabling dynamic<br>
configuration and management of physical computing resources.<br>
[00030]	A logical resource management layer 310 sits atop the physical resource<br>
management layer 308. The logical resource management layer 310 facilitates allocation<br>
of logical resources requested by the distributed application. For instance, the application<br>
might call for such resources as databases, load balancing services, firewall, web services,<br>
and so forth. The logical resource management layer 310 exposes such logical resources.<br>
[00031]	The next layer is the service defmition model and runtime layer 312,<br>
which allows description of the distributed application and tracking of its operation. The<br>
service defmition model (SDM) provides a namespace and context for describing<br>
operations processes and an API for application introspection and control of application<br>
resources. It further enables operators and developers to share common application<br>
views.<br>
[00032]	The sixth layer atop the computing resources layer 200 is the components<br>
layer 314. This layer permits defmition of reusable building blocks of a distributed<br>
application, which use the SDM APIs for context, naming, and binding. These building<br>
blocks are referred to as "components".<br>
[00033]	The top layer is the operations logic layer 316, which accommodates the<br>
operational aspects of the distributed application. The operations logic is responsible for<br>
12<br><br>
starting a service, growing and shrinking the service, upgrades and downgrades, fault<br>
detection and recovery, and state partitioning. The operations logic enables reuse of<br>
proven operational practices across deployments and applications. Through use of the<br>
SDM layer, the operations logic has context to better understand issues that may arise.<br>
For instance, when a failure occurs, the operations logic can determine that the failure<br>
occurred at the front-end of an email service, rather than just at some server in the middle<br>
of the room.<br>
tual Network Topologies<br>
The platform architecture provides a framework for generating virtual network<br>
topologies on top of the physical resources so that the same computing system can<br>
support multiple applications. A virtual LAN (VLAN) can be created for each<br>
application so that the application can execute in isolation of other applications running<br>
on the distributed computing system. Once a virtual network topology is created, the<br>
system facilitates automated deployment of the physical resources and connection to the<br>
appropriate VLANs to enable execution of the distributed application.<br>
[00035]	Fig. 4 shows a physical network topology 400 having an exemplary<br>
arrangement of five servers 402(1)-402(5) interconnected via a network switch 404. Each<br>
server 402 is physically coupled to an associated port Pi-Ps of the network switch 404.<br>
For discussion purposes, the network switch is implemented as one or more Ethernet<br>
switches.<br>
[00036]	Virtual  network  topologies   can  be   created  to   represent  distributed<br>
applications running on the physical computing resources 400. In this exemplary<br>
implementation, the virtual network topologies are created using Ethernet switches,<br>
13<br><br>
VLANs, and virtual network interfaces (VNICs). Ethernet networks allow segregation<br>
into multiple VLANs for network isolation. Nodes in a VLAN can communicate freely<br>
with other nodes in the same VLAN, but cannot talk directly to nodes outside the VLAN,<br>
VLANs can be implemented as port-based VLANs or protocol-based VLANs. Port-<br>
based VLANs occur within a single switch while protocol-based VLANs can span<br>
multiple switches. Protocol-based VLANs are standardized according to IEEE 802.IQ.<br>
The IEEE 802.1Q Standard describes how packets are marked and how VLANs are<br>
supported. This standard describes the 802.1Q packet extension as a tag header because<br>
each packet (frame) is marked (tagged) with 802.1Q information by adding the tag header<br>
to the frame.<br>
[00037]	Placing two or more computers in a VLAN is the physical equivalent of<br>
connecting those computers to the same physical network. This property is extended to<br>
create arbitrary virtual topologies on top of the physical network. Suppose, for example,<br>
that an application calls for three web servers on servers 402(1), 402(3), and 402(5) and<br>
one database on server 402(2). Moreover, the application architect is concerned about<br>
security and would like to place the web servers 402(1), 402(3), and 402(5) in one<br>
isolation zone and the database server 402(2) in a separate isolation zone, and connect the<br>
two isolation zones via a firewall.<br>
[00038]	Fig. 5 shows a virtual network topology 500 that can be formed from the<br>
physical resources 400 of Fig. 4 to achieve the applications architect's goals. The virtual<br>
network topology 500 has two VLANs: a Web VLAN 502 and a database (DB) VLAN<br>
504. Web servers 402(1), 402(3), and 402(5) are placed in the Web VLAN 502 and the<br>
database server 402(2) is placed in the DB VLAN 504. A firewall is deployed to server<br>
14<br><br>
402(4), which is then connected to both the Web VLAN 502 and the database VLAN<br>
504. This firewall 402(4) creates two isolation zones of the application, as represented by<br>
DMZweb 506 and DMZDB 508.<br>
[00039]	In this example, the firewall server 402(4) is a member of two VLANs.<br>
However, the server has just one physical interface for connection to port P4 of the<br>
network switch 404. To enable a single physical interface to support two VLANs, a<br>
VLAN driver is installed on the server 402(4) to create two virtual network interfaces<br>
(VNICs), so that the physical network interface (NIC) appears to connect to both VLANs.<br>
From the server's perspective, each virtual network interface appears like it is physically<br>
connected to a separate network.<br>
[00040]	Fig. 6 shows the firewall server 402(4) in more detail.   It implements a<br>
VLAN driver 602, which is installed in the protocol stack between the network interface<br>
(NIC) driver 604 and the ff driver 606. In one implementation, the VLAN driver 602 is<br>
downloaded and installed by the resource manager 212. The NIC driver 604 handles all<br>
packet traffic over the physical connection to the port PA of the switch 404. The VLAN<br>
driver 602 binds to the physical network interface and creates one or more virtual network<br>
interfaces (VNICs) over each physical network interface. Each virtual network interface<br>
represents a unique VLAN identity. In this example, the VLAN driver 602 creates two<br>
virtual network interfaces: VNIC VLANWeb 608 for the Web VLAN 502 and VNIC<br>
VLANDB 610 for the DB VLAN 504.<br>
[00041]	Outgoing packets destined for a particular VLAN are tagged with the<br>
corresponding VLAN identity at the associated VNIC. The application picks the<br>
appropriate VLAN by binding to a specific VNIC interface directly. The packets are then<br>
15<br><br>
sent out over the physical interface to the network switch. The switch examines the<br>
VLAN tag and is able to ascertain to which VLAN the packet is bound. Incoming<br>
packets are likewise tagged with a VLAN identity. The associated VN1C receives the<br>
packets, strips the tag, and passes the packets upstream to the ff driver for use in the<br>
appropriate application. This allows a server with a single physical NIC to participate in<br>
several VLANs.<br>
[00042]	The virtual network topology generation server 210 is shown coupled to<br>
the switch 404. Using remote programmability techniques, this server 210 can download<br>
and install the VLAN driver at the firewall server (if not present already) and then provide<br>
instructions to create the VNICs for the virtual network topology. It is noted that if the<br>
server is a member of only one VLAN (e.g., Web servers 402(1), 402(3), 402(5) and<br>
database server 402(2)), there is no need to install the VLAN driver 602 or to create a<br>
VNÏC. The network interface can designate the appropriate physical connection to the<br>
switch port, and the switch port can be configured with the appropriate VLAN<br>
membership, fonvarding all traffic to/from the server over the VLAN. On the other hand,<br>
there is no drawback to installing a VLAN driver and creating a single VNIC, even if the<br>
server is used for just a single VLAN.<br>
[00043]	For certain specialized devices, the resource manager may not be able to<br>
install a VNIC on these devices. However, these devices can still be programmed to a<br>
particular VLAN. Some devices are equipped with multiple physical ports. Each of these<br>
physical ports can be made a member of a different VLAN by programming the switch<br>
ports to which these devices are connected. For other specialized devices, the resource<br>
16<br><br>
manager programs them with a device-specific driver to place the appropriate port on a<br>
specific VLAN. This is akin to telling a switch port to be a member of a specific VLAN.<br>
[00044]	Generating Virtual Network Topologies<br>
Fig. 7 shows a process 700 for generating a virtual network topology to support a<br>
distributed application and deploying the resources for the application. The process 700<br>
is illustrated as a series of blocks, which represent operations performed by various<br>
computers in the computing system 200. The operations may be implemented in software<br>
that can be executed on the various computers. As such, the blocks represent instructions<br>
stored on computer-readable media that can be executed on processors to perform the<br>
associated operations.<br>
[00045]	At block 702, the application architect designs a virtual layout of a<br>
distributed application to be deployed on the distributed computïng system 200. The<br>
virtual layout specifies what components are used and how those components are<br>
interconnected. For instance, to design the application illustrated in Fig. 5, the architect<br>
would specify components for web servers, database server, firewall, and connections<br>
among these components.<br>
[00046]	At block 704, the system determines the physical resources that will be<br>
allocated to instantiate the various components of the distributed application. The system<br>
decides, for example, how many servers are to be deployed to support the application.<br>
This determination is based in part on input received from the architect indicating such<br>
parameters as the size of the service, how many users are anticipated, and so forth.<br>
[00047]	After the application is architected and instantiations for components are<br>
determined, the resource manager 212 implemented at the virtual network topology<br>
17<br><br>
generation server 210 uses virtual LANs (VLANs) and virtual network interfaces<br>
(VNICs) to realize the mapping from a virtual network topology to the physical network.<br>
At block 706, the virtual network topology generation server 210 creates at least one<br>
virtual LAN (VLAN) for each application.. A virtual network topology for a single<br>
application raay utilize more than one VLAN to establish multiple isolation zones, as is<br>
the case for the virtual network topology 500 illustrated in Fig. 5. In that example, the<br>
virtual network topology generation server 210 creates two VLANs: Web VLAN 502 and<br>
DB VLAN 504. The two VLANs isolate the web servers 402(1), 402(3), and 402(5) from<br>
the database server 402(2), thereby creating two isolation zones DMZWeb 506 and DMZoe<br>
508.<br>
[00048]	At block 708, the resource manager 212 at the virtual network topology<br>
generation server 210 deploys physical computing resources to the respective VLANs. In<br>
other words, the resource manager 212 assigns physical resources from the physical<br>
network 400 (Fig. 4) to support the virtual network topology of the application. This<br>
deployment involves two sub-operations, designated as blocks 708(1) and 708(2) in Fig.<br>
7.<br>
[00049]	At block 708(1), the resource manager 212 assigns an external switch port<br>
of the network switches 404 (i.e., a port that is connected to a server) to a designated<br>
VLAN to which the server belongs. An extemal switch port can be configured with one<br>
or more VLAN memberships.<br>
[00050]	At block 708(2), the resource manager 212 creates a virtual network<br>
interface (VNTC) at a server to enable communication over the designated VLAN sp that<br>
the server can become a member of the VLAN. It is noted that this operation is optional<br>
18<br><br>
if the server is a member of only one VLAN (e.g., Web servers 402(1), 402(3), 402(5)<br>
and database server 402(2)). In this case, configuring the switch port with the VLAN<br>
membership is adequate because the server will be communicating with over just one<br>
VLAN. The switch assumes that all traffic from the server is destined for the single<br>
configured VLAN. When the server is a member of two or more VLANs (e.g., fïrewall<br>
server 402(4)), a VLAN driver is installed on the server. The VLAN driver binds to the<br>
physical network interface and creates two or more virtual network interfaces (VNICs)<br>
above it. Each virtual network interface represents a unique VLAN identity. Packets sent<br>
out on a VNIC are tagged with the VLAN identity. The switch examines the VLAN tag<br>
and is able to ascertain to which VLAN the packet is bound.<br>
[00051]	The physical computing resources continue to be deployed in this two-<br>
operation marmer imtü the application is fully installed, as represented by the decision<br>
block 710.<br>
[00052]	To illustrate the deployment of physical resources, consider how the<br>
resource manager 212 deploys computers for the virtual network topology 500 of Fig. 5.<br>
This process will be described with reference to both Figs. 5 and 6. Initially, the two<br>
VLANs—Web VLAN 502 and DB VLAN 504—are created at operation 706. Next,<br>
suppose the resource manager 212 decides to add the fïrewall server 402(4) to the Web<br>
VLAN 502 to defïne isolation zone DMZweb 506. The resource manager 212 informs the<br>
switch 404 to set port 4 to reference the Web VLAN 502, which is illustrated in Fig. 6 by<br>
adding the "VLANWeb" identity to the port 4. This is representative of operation 708(1)<br>
in process 700. The switch 404 now understands that it is part of the isolation zone<br>
DMZWeb 506. The resource manager 212 then directs the VLAN driver 602 at the<br>
19<br><br>
firewall server 402(4) to create a VNIC for the Web VLAM, which is illustrated in Fig. 6<br>
as the VMC VLANWeb 604. This is representative of operation 708(2) in process 700.<br>
Packets passed over the VNIC VLANWeb 604 are tagged with the VLANWeb identity and<br>
routed correctly by the switch 404 over the Web VLAN 502.<br>
[00053]	Now, suppose the resource manager 212 adds the same firewall server<br>
402(4) to the DB VLAN 504 to define the other isolation zone DMZDB 508. The resource<br>
manager 212 informs the switch 404 to set port 4 to additionally reference the DB VLAN<br>
504, which is illustrated in Fig. 6 by adding the (!VLANDB" identity to the port 4. This is<br>
once again representative of operation 708(1) in process 700. The switch 404 is now also<br>
part of the isolation zone DMZos 508 and will accept packets with the VLANoe identity.<br>
The resource manager 212 then directs the VLAN driver 602 at the firewall server 402(4)<br>
to create a second VNIC, this time for the DB VLAN as illustrated in Fig. 6 by the VNIC<br>
VLANDB 606. This is another representation of operation 708(2) in process 700. Packets<br>
passed over the VNIC VLANDB 606 are tagged with the VLANDB identity and routed<br>
correctly by the switch 404 over the DB VLAN 504.<br>
[00054]	The process can be repeated for connecting each Web server 402(1),<br>
402(3), and 402(5) to the Web VLAN 502 and the database server to DB VLAN 504. As<br>
noted above, the addition of these servers can be accomplished by simply configuring the<br>
corresponding switch ports P1, P2, P3, and P5 with the appropriate VLAN membership.<br>
Virtual network interfaces need not be created at the servers, since the servers are<br>
currently part of just one VLAN.<br>
20<br><br>
[00055]	Exemplary Resource Manager APIs<br>
The following section provides an exemplary set of application program interfaces<br>
(APIs) provided by the resource manager (RM) 212 to remotely configure the switches<br>
and the servers.   The APIs are used to establish VLANs, connect the switches to the.<br>
appropriate VLANs, and create VNICs at the servers to facilitate corrununication over<br>
associated VLANs, thereby realizing the mapping from the virtual network topologies<br>
onto the physical network resources,     It is noted that this topology mapping  is<br>
accomplished using in-band techniques over the existing network, rather than using a<br>
specially dedicated out-of-band network.   Accordingly, there is a default connectivity<br>
from which to begin, thus providing a foundation for configuring new VLANs as needed.<br>
[00056]	The construction and de-allocation of virtual topologies is facilitated by<br>
the following core web methods exposed by the RM:<br>
•	AllocateVlan()<br>
•	ConstructVlan()<br>
•	AttachComputerToVlan()<br>
•	DetachComputerFromVlan()<br>
•	ReleaseVlan()<br>
