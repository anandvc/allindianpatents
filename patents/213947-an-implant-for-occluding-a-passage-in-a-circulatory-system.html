AN IMPLANT FOR. OCCLUDTNG A PASSAGE<br>
5 	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention generally relates to an implant device for closing a body passage<br>
	(e.g., an aperture through the atrial diaphragm or septum or the ventricle diaphragm or<br>
	septum of a heait) or in a body channel, and more particularly comprising an occluding<br>
10	or closing body which is expanded and fixed into place at the passage area to be oc-<br>
	cluded/closed,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15<br>
	By way of example EP-A-0362 113 shows a device for closing a passage in the heart of<br>
	patients, wherein the closing part runs the risk of tipping over and thereby causing the<br>
	passage to be exposed in passing through the heart. The cause of the non-secure closing<br>
	capacity is the relative unfixed maneuverability for the closing part when applied<br>
20	around the passage, and that the application takes part long before it has arrived in its<br>
	final position around the passage in the heart.<br>
	WO 02/38051 discloses implants for occluding a passage in a circulatory system. This<br>
	implant has its particular application as a cardiological implant by means of which it is<br>
25	possible, for example, to close an aperture through the auricle diaphragm or the ventri-<br>
	cle diaphragm of a heart. It is arranged to be deployed or built up (i.e., assembled) at a<br>
	desired location in the body (e.g., the heart), in contrast to known other implants (e.g.,<br>
	so-called umbrellas and sails) that are instead extended as soon as the compressed um-<br>
	brella leaves its insertion sheath. It includes a plurality of thin wire-like members each<br>
30	having a proximal and a distal end. The members are made of non-bendable material.<br>
	Two holders are provided to which these ends are attached. When the distance between<br>
	the two holders is reduced the non-bendable members are caused to execute a twisting<br>
	motion yielding in a plurality of radially extending loops, which are fixed in their posi-<br>
BESTÃ„TIGUNGSKOPIE<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
2<br>
	tion. In one embodiment, a balloon structure is expanded. In another embodiment, an<br>
	occluding body arranged in the middle between the two holders is expanded by the<br>
	twisting members. WO 02/38051 suggests to use nitinol as material for the wire-like<br>
	members or threads,<br>
5<br>
	It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide, based on the device dis-<br>
	closed in WO 02/38051, an occlusive device being more acceptable by a living body,<br>
	especially by a human body.<br>
10<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The foregoing object is achieved by means of an implant according to the present inven-<br>
	tion, which is substantially characterized in that it is compressible for insertion through<br>
15	a delivery mechanism and is deployable for occluding the passage in the circulatory<br>
	system, wherein the implant is at least partially made of at least some biodegradable<br>
	 material.<br>
This object is farther achieved by means of a device according to the present invention,<br>
20	which is substantially characterized in that it comprises<br>
	a plurality of thin, preferably stiff, members each having a proximal and a distal<br>
	end;<br>
	a first holder to which the distal ends of said members are attached;<br>
		a second holder to which the proximal ends of said members are attached;<br>
25 	an expansible, preferably foldable, occluding body attached to said members;<br>
	said plurality of members with said occluding body forming an elongated article<br>
	extending along a longitudinal axis and being adapted for insertion through a de-<br>
	livery mechanism in an insertion condition;<br>
	said members being attached to said first and second holders and the distance be-<br>
30	tween said holdere being reduceable in manner to cause said members to execute<br>
	a twisting motion relative to said axis to yield a plurality of generally radially ex-<br>
	tending loops forming at least one fixation structure, thereby expanding, prefera-<br>
	bly unlfolding the occluding body and<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
3<br>
	said at least one fixation structure being fixable in a final occluding condition,<br>
	wherein one or more of said plurality of members, said first holder, said second<br>
	holder and said expansible occluding body is made of at least some biodegradable<br>
	material.<br>
5<br>
	The implant according to the invention is formed partly or entirely of biodegradable or<br>
	bioabsorbable material (s). A living body can degrade or absorb it, therefore minimizing<br>
	the risk of non-compliance with the immunological system of the living body.<br>
10	Usually, an intravenous delivery mechanism is used. However other delivery mecha-<br>
	nisms, such as one using the esophagus can be used.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, at least the wire-like members or threads and/or the occlud-<br>
	ing body are made of biodegradable or bioabsorbable material.<br>
	These and other advantages and objects achieved by the present invention will be fur-<br>
	ther appreciated and understood upon consideration of the following detailed descrip-<br>
	tion of certain embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings in which:<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
	The device according to the invention is based on the implants disclosed in<br>
	WO 02/38051, the disclosure thereof is incorporated in this description by reference,<br>
20<br>
	This device or implant is employed as an implant for closing an internal passage, for<br>
	example, an aperture in the auricle diaphragm or the ventricle diaphragm of a heart, or<br>
	in a desired body channel which one wishes to close. A closing body is deployed or<br>
	unfolded at the location. More particularly, the closing body is arranged to be expanded,<br>
25	preferably unfolded, at the position of the intended closing spot, after insertion through<br>
	a body vein.<br>
	The closing body consists for example of an inflatable balloon or of an expansible, pref-<br>
	erably unfoldable, disk-shaped member. The closing body is arranged to be dilated, ex-<br>
30	panded or unfolded radially by means of a number of stiffening means, which are made<br>
	of non-bendable material and therefore twist when the distance between their fixed ends<br>
	is reduced. A locking mechanism, preferably consisting of snap together members, are<br>
	provided for locking the wire-like members in their twisted position.<br><br>
WO 2004/047649	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
5<br>
	This implant is delivered to the location for application in the form of a thin, elongated<br>
	device and is then expanded or unfolded into its locking position.<br>
5 	FIGS.1 - 4 disclose a first embodiment of a device 101 being formed as an implant for<br>
	closing a passage. This implant utilizes the rotating quality of non- bendable materials<br>
	when they are compressed, and when the ends move past a critical point. For this object,<br>
	there are thin threads attached around an inner core of material in each end inside a bal-<br>
	loon. The distal and the proximal balloons have a further opening between them and the<br>
10	diameter of the balloon at its smallest part corresponding to the ASD-size, i.e. that it is<br>
	somewhat but not much larger. The balloons are inflated by means of a contrast fluid<br>
	whereupon the furthermost, as seen in the direction of insertion, attachment point of the<br>
	threads are slowly pulled back at the same time as the nearest, as seen in the direction of<br>
	insertion, are pushed ahead, i.e. in the direction toward each other. At a critical position,<br>
15	the threads twist or spiral sideways and maintain a circular shape, which desired shape<br>
	is used according to the present invention. In position, the balloons are evacuated and<br>
	the threads are locked in the twisted spring-like position.<br>
	The implant comprises a closing body 106 which is attachable at the passage, alone or<br>
20	in combination with farther sealing means in a radial direction 107 which is also an ex-<br>
	panding stiffening fluid tight closing body. The body 106 is arranged that after insertion<br>
	through a body vein (not shown) in its longitudinal direction150, it will be built up at<br>
	the position 109 for the intended closing spot.<br>
25	A number of threads 151 which in the shown embodiment are eight in number, are ar-<br>
	ranged of such a material and with such qualities that they twist automatically sideways<br>
	to form a circular or loop shape when compressed longitudinally, as is shown in FIG.3,<br>
	and are locked in the twisted, spiral or coil-like position for interconnecting the two<br>
	chambers, and so on, against each other. The body 106 is formed by a plurality of thin<br>
30	threads or wires, which are attached respectively in axial direction 150, 152 relative to<br>
	each other on movable holder nuclei 153, 154. The threads 151 are arranged to twist<br>
	sideways in the same direction and then to assume a somewhat circular shape 155, simi-<br>
	lar to a flower, a propeller or an umbrella, with circular shape and arranged with suit-<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
6<br>
	able means for closing the passage.<br>
	For example, the closing portion may be formed of layers of watertight material con-<br>
	nected to the threads 151. These layers and/or the threads are preferably made of a bio-<br>
5	degradable material as disclosed in the following example. Preferably, the layers and the<br>
	threads are made of a biodegradable material. Preferably, the whole implant is made of<br>
	a biodegradable material.<br>
	In the example according to FIG. 4 the threads 151 are shown attached with different<br>
10	inclination x, y with reference to the respective separate holder nuclei 156, 157. The<br>
	threads 151 are arranged to be mutually forced to be directed toward that holder nucleus<br>
	157 from which the threads 151 depart with the largest angle y, as calculated from the<br>
	centre axis 158 of the ho1der nuclei, with similar angle z for the different threads 151.<br>
15	FIGS.5 - 10 further illustrate a second embodiment of the present invention:<br>
	FIG. 5 shows the implant 200 of the present invention in a perspective view in an initial<br>
	position, i.e., before the device is applied to the passage in a circulatory system and de-<br>
	ployed. In the figures a plurality of thin stiff generally inextensible, but somewhat flesxi-<br>
	ble, members or wires 202 are provided. The whole implant, but at least the members<br>
20	202 are preferably biodegradable. While the figure shows eight members, it should be<br>
	understood that the number of members can be varied and not change the spirit of the<br>
	invention.<br>
	In one embodiment of the invention, the members 202 may be formed of a biodegrad-<br>
25	able or bioabsorbable material consisting of a polymer that exhibits a relatively high<br>
	degree of biocompatibilily. These materials have been previously used in stents, for<br>
	example. Bioabsorb able implantable occlusive devices of the present invention maybe<br>
	made completely or partly of poly(alpba-hydroxy acid) such as polylaclide [poly-L-<br>
	lactide (PLLA), poIy-D-lactide (PDLA)l, polyglycolide (PGA), polydioxanone, poly-<br>
30	caprolactone, polygluconate, polylactic acid-polyethylene oxide copolymers,<br>
	poly(hydroxybutyrate), polyanhydride, polyphosphoester, poly(amino acids), or related<br>
	copolymers materials, each of which have a characteristic degradation rate in the body.<br>
	For example, PGA and polydioxanone are relatively fast-bioabsorbing materials (weeks<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
7<br>
	to months) and PLA and polycaprolaclone are relatively slow-bioabsorbing material<br>
	(months to years). Reference is made to Enhancement of the Mechanical properties of<br>
	polylactides by solid-stale extrusion, W. Weiler and S. Gogolawski, Biomaterials 1956,<br>
	Vol.17 No. 5, pp. 529-535; and Deformation Characteristics of a Bioabsorbable In-<br>
5	travascular Stent, Investigative Radiology, December 1992,C. Mauli, Agrawat, Ph.D.,<br>
	P.E., H. G. Clark Ph.D., pp. 1020-1024.<br>
	Mechanical properties of these materials generally increase with increasing molecular<br>
	weight. For instance, the strength and modulus of PLA generally increase with mcreas-<br>
10	ing molecu1ar weight. Degradation time generally decreases with decieasing initial mo-<br>
	lecular weight (i.e., a mesh device made of a low molecular weight polymer would be<br>
	bioabsorbed before a mesh device made of a high molecular weight polymer). Low mo-<br>
	lecular weight PLA is generally more susceptible to thermo-oxidative degradation than<br>
	high molecular weight grades, so an optimum molecular weight range should be se-<br>
15	lected to balance properties, degradation time, and stability. The molecular weight and<br>
	mechanical properties of the material generally decrease as degradation progresses.<br>
	PLA. generally has a degradation time greater than 1 year. Ethylene oxide sterilization<br>
	process (EtO) is a preferred method of sterilization. Furthermore, PLA has a glass tran-<br>
	sition temperature of about 60 degreesC, so care must be taken not to expose products<br>
20	to high temperature environments for substantial time periods (temperatures greater<br>
	than 60 degrees C), to avoid the possibility of dimensional distortion or other degrada-<br>
	tion effects.<br>
	PLA, PLLA, PDLA and PGA include tensile strengths of from about 40 thousands of<br>
25	pounds per square inch (ksi) to about 120 ksi; a tensile strength of 80 ksi is typical; and<br>
	a preferred tensile strength of from about 60 ksi to at out 120 ksi.<br>
	Polydioxanone, polyeaprolactone, and polygluconate include tensile strengths of from<br>
	about 15 ksi to about 60 ksi; a tensile strength of about 35 ksi is typical; and a preferred<br>
30	tensile strength of from about 25 ksi to about 45 ksi.<br>
	PLA: PLLA, PDLA and PGA include tensile modulus of from about 400,000 pounds<br>
	per square inch (psi) to about 2,000,000 psi; a tensile modulus of 900,000 psi is typical;<br><br>
WO 2004/047649	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
8<br>
	and a preferred tensile modulus of from about 700,000 psi to about 1,200,000 psi.<br>
	Polydioxanone, polyeaprolactone, and polygluconaie include tensile modulus of from<br>
	about 200,000 psi lo about 700,000 psi; a tensile modulus of 450,000 psi is typical; and<br>
5	a preferred tensile moduilus of from about 350,000 psi to about550,000 psi.<br>
	PLLA filament has a much tower tensile strength, and tensile modulus than, for exam-<br>
	 ple, Elgiloy.RTM. metal alloy wire which may be used to make braided mesh devices or<br>
	elements. The tensile strength of PLLA is about 22% of the tensile strength of El-<br>
10	giloy.RTM. The tensile modulus of PLLA is about 3% of the tensile modulus of El-<br>
	giloy.RTM. mechanical properties and self-expansion are directly proportional to tensile<br>
	modulus of the material. As a result, a PLLA filament or braided or woven element<br>
	made to the same design as the implant of the present invention may have poor me-<br>
	chanical properties and may not be functional. The polymeric in extensible members 202<br>
15	should have radial strength similar to meta members and should have the required me-<br>
	chanical properties capable of bracing open endoluminal or the like strictures.<br>
	Each member 202 has a proximal end 204 and a distal end 206. The proximal end 204 Is<br>
	shown here positioned adjacent the user's hand 2O8 while the distal end 206 enters the<br>
20	passage (not shown) first. In practice, of course, the hand would typically be much far-<br>
	ther away, given that the device will be introduced intravenously. The distal ends 206 of<br>
	the inextansible members 202 are attached to a first holder 210 that has a ring shape like<br>
	that of a circular hub or hub flange. The proximal ends 204 of the inextensible members<br>
	202 are attached to a second holder 212 similar to the first holder 210, i.e., a ring-<br>
25	shaped holder or hub,<br>
	At a point generally midway between the first holder 210 and the second holder 212 an<br>
	expansible, preferably unfoldable, occluding body 214 is attached to the members 202.<br>
	The occluding body 214 may be a generally circular disc-shaped member, and may be<br>
30	made of a flexible fabric-like material consistent with surgical use and more preferably<br>
	of a biodegradable material. The occluding body 214 has a distal face 216 oriented to-<br>
	ward the distal ends 206 of the members 202 and a proximal face 218 oriented toward<br>
	the proximal ends 204 of the members 202. The members 202 preferably have a thick-<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
9<br>
	ened portion 220 where they pass through openings 222 in the occluding body 214. The<br>
	thickened portion 220 is actually two parts 220a, 220b which serve to capture and<br>
	mount the occluding body 214 therebetween.<br>
5 	The firet bolder 210 is attached to a first end 224 of a carrier rod 226 at the disial ends<br>
	206 of the members 202, The second holder 212 is slidably received on the carrier rod<br>
	226. In the condition shown in FIG. 11, the members 202 are arranged about the carrier<br>
	rod 226 in a substantially equally spaced manner and generally aligned with the longi-<br>
	tudinal axis A of the carrier rod 226. The occluding body 214 extends in a generally<br>
10	radial manner from the carrier rod 226 at a mid-point between the proximal 204 and<br>
	distal ends 206 of the inextensible members. In the arrangement shown in FIG.11, the<br>
	implant 200 forms an elongated apparatus or article that generally extends along longi-<br>
	tudinal axis A. The elongate form of the implant 200 permits it to be tightly compressed<br>
	and inserted through an intravenous delivery mechanism and in the form shown is re-<br>
15	ferred to as being in the insertion condition.<br>
	In operation, a driving implement 228, (e.g., a plastic tube) can be placed over the car-<br>
	rier rod 226 in contact wilh the second holder 212. The driving implement 228 is slid<br>
	along or moved toward the first substantially fixed holder 210 (i.e., toward the first end<br>
20	224 of the carrier rod 226) along the carrier rod 226. Generally, as will be farther de-<br>
	scribed, when the driving implement 228 is moved toward the first holder 210 the two<br>
	holders 210, 212 are driven relatively closer together, and the implant 220 is changed<br>
	into a deployed condition.<br>
25	FIGS.5 - 8 show the implant 200 in a perspective view in various conditions of de-<br>
	ployment. As can be seen in these figures, moving the two holders 210, 212 together at<br>
	first tends to cause the inextensible member 202 at the distal end to assume a gently<br>
	outwardly bowed configuration with respect to the longitudinal axis A of the carrier rod<br>
	226. This outwardly bowed configuration pulls the expansible occluding body 214 into<br>
30	a tensioned radial disk shape.<br>
	Further moving the driving implement 228 towards the first holder 210 along the carrier<br>
	rod 226 causes a first portion 230 of the inextensible members 202 located between the<br><br>
WO 2004/047649	 PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
10<br>
	first holder 210 and the occluding body 214, to assume a more bowed, almost semi-<br>
	circular shape where the distal ends 206 of the members 202 attach to the first holder<br>
	210 in a nearly perpendicular direction with respect to the longitudinal axis A of the<br>
	carrier rod 226. A second portion 232 of the inextensible members 202 at the proximal<br>
5	end tends to remain relatively parallel to the longitudinal axis A at first.<br>
	The in extensible members 202 are shown in FIG.7 in a condition in response to yield-<br>
	ing to further compression. As shown, the first portions 230 of the members 202 have<br>
	started to twist or spiral about the carrier rod 226 forming a plurality of generally radial<br>
10	loops (with respect to the axis of the carrier rod). What then happens is that the first<br>
	portion 230 then passes through a critical point, whereupon each wire in this portion<br>
	230 snaps into a generally radially-extending loop, yielding a somewhat concave petal-<br>
	shaped structure at the distal side of the occluding body 214. Further compressing the<br>
	second portion 232 likewise results in the formation of similar loops in a petal-shaped<br>
15	structure on the proximal side of the occluding body 214.<br>
	FIGS.8 and 9 show the implant 200 in a perspective view in a fully deployed condition.<br>
	Both the first portion 230 and second portion 232 have responded to the compressing<br>
	motion by twisting away from the axial direction A. Thereby, the first portion 230 of the<br>
20	members have resolved into a first fixation structure 230 adjacent the distal face 216 of<br>
	the occluding body. Similarly, the second portion 232 of the members 202 have re-<br>
	solved into a second fixation structure 232 adjacent the proximal face 218 of the oc-<br>
	cluding body 214. The overlapping spiral shape of both the first and second fixation<br>
	structure 230, 232 is a stable shape, that locks the implant 200 into a stable occluding<br>
25	or deployed condition upon the locking holders 210, 212 being driven together by the<br>
	driving implement 228, as shown in FIG.11.<br>
	FIG. 10 shows a perspective view of a portion of the implant without the occluding<br>
	body and members or carrier rod. Thus, the first and second holders or hubs 210, 212<br>
30	may be seen in more detail. The first and second holders 210, 212 may be adapted to be<br>
	placed onto the carrier rod (not shown) by hollow central shafts 234, 236. Located about<br>
	the central shafts 234, 236 are annular portions 238, 240 with a plurality of slots 242 or<br>
	attachment points sized to fixedly receive the ends of the members 202. The slots 242<br><br>
WO 2004/047649 	PCT/CH2003/000776<br>
11<br>
	may extend to the periphery 244 of the annular portions 238, 240 to allow the members<br>
	202 to move from a longitudinal orientation to a radial, orientation.<br>
	An extending tooth 246 may be formed on one of the first and second holders 210, 212<br>
5.	or in the altemate, the carrier rod (not shown) to engage and form a locking element<br>
	with a corresponding recess (not shown) formed in one or both of the first and second<br>
	holders 210, 212. In this manner, the implant 200 becomes locked into a fully deployed<br>
	or final occluding condition upon being driven together by the driving implement by<br>
	engagement of the tooth 246 and the recess.<br>
10<br>
	The invention has been carefully described in the above-mentioned examples, and there-<br>
	fore the idea should be clearly understood that ihe invention is neither limited to the<br>
	above described and on the drawings shown embodiment, but may be varied within the<br>
	scope of the claims without departing from the concept of the invention. For example,<br>
15	the invention can also be applied to other occluders, for example occluders as disclosed<br>
	in US 6'623'508, US 6'077'29l, US 6'599'308, US 6'506'204, US 6'379'368 and US<br>
