				<td>Apparatus for purifying water<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for purifying<br>
water, that includes a frame, in connection with which<br>
is arranged a primary space for water to be filtered,<br>
secondary space for filtered water and filtering<br>
means, which filtering means are arranged to filter<br>
water, that is driven by gravity from the primary<br>
space existing in the frame to the secondary space,<br>
wherein the filtering influence of the filtering means<br>
is based essentially on a thin filtering film made of<br>
plastic based material, such as PTM (Particle Track<br>
Membrane), TeM (Track-etch Membrane) or like, the<br>
thickness of which is advantageously 7-25 urn and the<br>
size of pores advantageously between 0,05-10 urn. The<br>
filtering means include at least a support arrangement<br>
to support the filtering film, such as an auxiliary<br>
frame having a planar or cylindrical support surface<br>
or like, in connection with which is arranged a flow<br>
way in order to lead the filtered water to the<br>
secondary space.<br>
In the Finnish Patent number 98810 there has been<br>
presented a water purification device, that is partly<br>
of the type above and that has a Membrane-structured<br>
filtering film. The solution in question is meant to<br>
operate on so called syphon principle, thanks to which<br>
the structure of the same is very simple. The water<br>
purification device in question is very safe and easy<br>
to use in practice, because the quality of the water<br>
flowing down to the collecting point, taking place<br>
thanks to the syphon phenomenon self-powered and<br>
continuously, is always homogeneous regardless of the<br>
user of the device. This is first of all due to the<br>
fact, that a water purification device equipped with<br>
a thin PTM- or TeM filtering film does not at any<br>
stage let through material parts exceeding a certain<br><br>
particle size, in which case, when the filtering film<br>
gets dirty, only the penetration speed of the filter<br>
decreases and may even' totally be interrupted, in case<br>
the filtering film is not cleaned every now and then.<br>
The type of device described above is very easy to use<br>
in most heterogeneous connections, e.g. for filtering<br>
of lake water on terrain or under other circumstances<br>
as well, when so called tap water may not be exploited<br>
or when it is not drinkable. A disadvantage of the<br>
device in question is mainly the fact, that e.g. in<br>
ordinary household uses, the device requires use of<br>
separate vessels, so that the syphon phenomenon may be<br>
carried out.<br>
On the other har.d, nowadays there are water purifying<br>
devices on the market also, which have a so called<br>
primary space and a secondary space built-in with the<br>
same body. One purifying device existing on the market<br>
nowadays has name "KATADYN, Type TRK", that is based<br>
on ceramic filter cartridges, that exist in a uniform<br>
reservoir and that let through water gravity-operated<br>
from a primary space to a secondary space, that is<br>
placed underneath the primary space and that is<br>
equipped with a tap in order to run filtered water. In<br>
the solution in question there has been exploited<br>
furthermore activated carbon, that is placed inside<br>
the ceramic filter.<br>
Functioning of this type of structure is inadequate<br>
first of all thanks to its slowness (about 40 lit-<br>
res/24 hours) , which is among other things due to the<br>
fact, that when the level of water surface gets down,<br>
the filtering surface of the filter gets continuously<br>
smaller. Ceramic material has furthermore such a<br>
disadvantage, that ceramic filtering material absorbes<br>
substances existing in the water to be treated, such<br>
as humus or like, which is why it first of all gets<br><br>
dyed thoroughly and on the other hand naturally lets<br>
a large quantity of fine-grained humus through the<br>
same. This is why a ceramic filter clogs up in the<br>
course of time and it is not possible to "open" the<br>
same or in other words e.g. wipe it clean otherwise<br>
than peeling off its surface, thanks to which the<br>
substance layer carrying out filtration gets thinner,<br>
which finally causes a risk for reliability. When<br>
using this type of solution, one may not under all<br>
circumstances have full certainty, whether the water,<br>
that has been treated is totally safe for drinking,<br>
that is why it is safest to avoid use of the type of<br>
purifying device described above under particularly<br>
disadvantageous circumstances.<br>
On the other hand, there are on the market nowadays<br>
also water purifying devices being sold under name<br>
"BRITA" or "AQUALETTE, LEIFHEIT", that are based on<br>
lighter structures in such respect, that merely<br>
activated carbon for water filtration and purifying<br>
has been exploited therewith. This is why it is not<br>
technically taken possible to reach the level of<br>
ceramic filters described above, that is why this type<br>
of solutions are applicable mostly for tidy housekee-<br>
ping purposes, wherein the meaning is mostly to remove<br>
e.g. taste of chlorine from water. Actual removal of<br>
bacteria is not enabled by the type of solutions.<br>
It is the aim of the apparatus for purifying water<br>
according to this invention to achieve a decisive<br>
improvement in the problems presented above and thus<br>
to raise substantially the level of prior art. In<br>
order to carry out this aim, the main characteristic<br>
of the present invention is such, that essentially<br>
underneath the primary space is arranged an accessory<br>
space for the filtering means, that is in connection<br>
with the primary space; and that has an essentially<br>
smaller cross-section than the same, in order to keep<br><br>
the filtering means	surrounded by unclean water in the<br>
accessory space of	the primary space, being limited<br>
from the secondary	space, totally separate from the<br>
secondary space.<br>
As the most important advantages of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention may be mentioned the<br>
simplicity, reliability and the compact size of its<br>
structure. This is why the apparatus according to the<br>
invention is applicable for most heterogeneous appli-<br>
cations in most heterogeneous connections and environ-<br>
ments e.g. either as a purifying device to be kept on<br>
table or as a relatively small-sized pot. The princi-<br>
ple according to the invention enables an extremely<br>
simple composition thanks to the fact, that both the<br>
primary space and the secondary space are stationarily<br>
and in a built-in manner in the same frame, whereby,<br>
however, between the same has been arranged a filter<br>
arrangement based on a filtering film of Membrane-<br>
type, that operates extremely reliably. Because the<br>
filter arrangement is placed in an accessory space<br>
surrounded by the secondary space and however fysical-<br>
ly totally separate therefrom, the filter arrangement<br>
is not in any way directly in touch with the filtered<br>
water, that is why e.g. replacement of the filter or<br>
other necessary measures, are not in any way able to<br>
cause a risk so, that bacteria might pass to the<br>
secondary space or in other words to the clean water<br>
side. The apparatus according to the invention may be<br>
carried out to work gravity-operated by a direct flow-<br>
through or on the other hand alternatively by exploi-<br>
ting e.g. syphon pnenomenon. Use as well as service and<br>
maintenance of an apparatus according to the invention<br>
is thus extremely simple and easy in most hetero-<br>
geneous applications and environments, thanks to which<br>
the principle according to the invention may be<br>
adapted also in very primitive circumstances reliably.<br><br>
As a summary of the advantages of the water purifying<br>
apparatus according to the invention, technical<br>
reliability and safety of its use may be mentioned,<br>
because the uniform and even surface structure of the<br>
filtering film of Membrane-type being exploited<br>
therewith as well as those essentially cylindrical<br>
holes existing therein (see figures 4a and 4b) enable<br>
first of all cleaning of the filtering film without<br>
the risk of the film getting damaged. In addition to<br>
that, the cylindrical holes make sure of the reliable<br>
operating of the filtering film particularly in view<br>
of prevention o:l: e.g. bacteria penetration, because<br>
the size of pores is at each point of the filtering<br>
film always within allowed limits at its height.<br>
The non-independent claims related to the apparatus<br>
set forth preferred embodiments of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with<br>

The invention relates to an apparatus for purifying<br>
water, which includes a frame 1, in connection with<br>
which is arranged a primary space la for water to be<br>
filtered, secondary space 1b for filtered water and<br>
filtering means 2. The filtering means 2 are arranged<br>
to filter water, that is driven by gravity from the<br>
primary space la existing in the frame to the seconda-<br>
ry space lb, wherein the filtering influence of the<br><br>
filtering means is based essentially on a thin filte-<br>
ring film 2a mads of plastic based material, such as<br>
PTM (Particle Track Membrane) , TeM (Track-etch Membra-<br>
ne) or like, the thickness of which is preferably 7-25<br>
µm and the size of pores between 0,05-10 urn, whereby<br>
the filtering means include at least a support arran-<br>
gement 2b to support the filtering film 2a, such as an<br>
auxiliary frame 2bl, 2b2 having a planar or cylindri-<br>
cal support surface or like, in connection with which<br>
is arranged a flow way 3a in order to lead the filte-<br>
red water to the secondary space 1b. Essentially<br>
underneath the primary space la is arranged an acces-<br>
sory space lal for the filtering means 2, that is in<br>
connection with the primary space and that has an<br>
essentially smaller cross-section than the same, in<br>
order to keep the filtering means 2 surrounded by<br>
unclean water in the accessory space lal of the<br>
primary space la, being limited from the secondary<br>
space lb, totally separate from the secondary space<br>
lb.<br>
As an advantageous embodiment of the apparatus, the<br>
filtering film 2a is as shown e.g. in figures 4a, 4b,<br>
5 and 7 a uniform and an even surface structure, the<br>
porosity of which is provided by essentially cylindri-<br>
cal holes existing therein. In this connection figures<br>
4a and 4b show a front view and a cross sectional<br>
perspective view of enlarged photos, that are made<br>
with differing enlargements, representing a typical<br>
PTM/TeM filtering film being exploited with the<br>
purifying device for water, that is manufactured by<br>
irradiating and etching a raw film sheet. By using the<br>
type of filtering film 2a described above, the pressu-<br>
re loss caused by the filtering means may be effi-<br>
ciently minimized. This is why the purifying apparatus<br>
for water according to the invention is thus applica-<br>
ble to be used as a drinking water purifier, that is<br>
thus easy to use and reliable under most heterogeneous<br><br><br>
circumstances all the way from ordinary household use<br>
up to extremely difficult circumstances. In addition<br>
to that the flow-through of the purifying apparatus<br>
for water according to the invention as well as the<br>
pressure loss caused by the same are decisively better<br>
than the same of a ceramic purifier, e.g. the manufac-<br>
turing costs of which are also manyfold.<br>
From the technical point of view it is also clear,<br>
that a porosity of this type of Membrane-film, which<br>
is typically between 5-15 %, may not be achieved by a<br>
ceramic filtering material, because the porosity of<br>
ceramic material is always between 30-95 % in practi-<br>
ce. A reliable operating of the filter may not be<br>
obtained with a ceramic structure particularly in the<br>
sense of bacteria filtration because of the unhomo-<br>
geneous construction of the ceramic structure, whereby<br>
instead, when according to the invention a filtering<br>
film is being UEsed made of plastic based material, it<br>
is possible to make sure, that the size of pores is<br>
exactly e.g. 0,4 µm at its height.<br>
As a particularly advantageous embodiment with refe-<br>
rence particularly to Fig. 7, the filtering film 2a is<br>
strengthened preferably by lamination or correspondin-<br>
gly with a strengthening layer v made of non-woven<br>
material, that is arranged on one or both outer<br>
surfaces of the same, such as on the surface placed<br>
against the support surface supporting the same. The<br>
strengthening material v of the filtering film 2a is<br>
furthermore as an advantageous embodiment plastic<br>
based material, such as polyethylene, polyprophylene<br>
and/or like, the specific weight of which is 30-300<br>
g/m2, advantageously 150-200 g/m2. The size of pores of<br>
the perforation in the; filtering film 2a is furthermo-<br>
re advantageously between 0,1-0,6 µm, wherein the pore<br>
density of the same is preferably l,5xlO9 - 5xl07<br>
holes/cm2.<br><br>
Particularly in the advantageous embodiments shown in<br>
figures 1b, 3a and 3b, the apparatus is arranged to<br>
act by gravity so, that water flowing down from the<br>
primary space la from above the filtering means 2 gets<br>
exhausted after passing the filtering means 2 through<br>
a flow way 3a, that is arranged essentially at the<br>
bottom part of the filtering means, essentially into<br>
the bottom part of the secondary space 1b.<br>
On the other hand in the advantageous embodiment shown<br>
in figures la, 2c. and 2b, the apparatus is arranged to<br>
act by gravity utilizing syphon phenomen so, that<br>
water flowing down from the primary space la from<br>
above the filtering means 2 through the filtering<br>
means 2 is being led by means of a flow way 3a, such<br>
as through a pipe arrangement 3a1 or correspondingly,<br>
by utilizing syphon phenomen essentially above the<br>
filtering means 2, essentially into the bottom part of<br>
the secondary space lb.<br>
Particularly in the type of embodiment shown in<br>
figures la and 1b, the cross-section of the accessory<br>
space 1a1 is formed advantageously like a rectangle,<br>
whereby the filtering means 2 are formed e.g. of one<br>
or more planar filtering cartridges shown in Fig. 5,<br>
in which the filtering film 2a, that is protected by<br>
protecting covers k being fastened advantageously on<br>
quick-release principle, is closed hermetically in<br>
connection with a planar auxiliary frame 2b1. There is<br>
naturally not a necessary need for using this type of<br>
protecting covers.<br>
Correspondingly in the type of embodiments shown in<br>
figures 2a, 2b and 3a, 3b, the cross-section of the<br>
accessory space lal is arranged circular, whereby the<br>
filtering means 2 are formed e.g. of one or more<br>
cylindrical filtering cartridges shown in fig. 6, in<br>
which the filtering film 2a is closed hermetically in<br><br><br>
connection with a cylindrical auxiliary frame 2b2 . In<br>
figures 7 and 8 there are presented some advantageous<br>
part entireties of this type of composition with<br>
porous extra protecting layers s and end flanges p.<br>
Furthermore as an advantageous embodiment in connecti-<br>
on with the filtering means 2, such as e.g. in front<br>
of the auxiliary frame 2b1 and the filtering film 2a<br>
or on the principle shown in Fig. 2b inside the<br>
auxiliary frame 2b2, are arranged accessory filtering<br>
means 4 for treating water, that is going to pass or<br>
that has already passed the filtering film 2a, furt-<br>
hermore by activated carbon or like before removing of<br>
the same through the flow way 3a into the secondary<br>
space.<br>
The apparatus includes naturally also an exhaust flow<br>
arrangement 5 for exploitation of the filtered water,<br>
such as e.g. a pouring spout 5a of the type shown in<br>
figures la and 1b, or on the other hand a valve 5b of<br>
the type shown in figures 2a, 2b and 3a, 3b. In this<br>
type of embodiment the "ventilation" of the secondary<br>
space 1b may be carried out e.g. by an air duct of the<br>
presented type, that connects the air spaces of the<br>
primary and the secondary spaces or on the other hand<br>
by totally separate ventilation arrangements.<br>
It is obvious, that the invention is not limited to<br>
the embodiments presented or described above, but<br>
instead it can be modified to a great extent within<br>
the basic idea. So it is in principle possible to<br>
carry out the construction of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention in very many ways, e.g.by combining<br>
cylindrical cartridges with an accessory space, the<br>
cross-section of which is rectangular or the shape of<br>
which is polygon, or vice versa and so on. Furthermore<br>
it is naturally possible to exploit also the type of<br>
solutions shown in the drawings otherwise, by using<br><br><br>
several filter cartridges, that are placed e.g. side<br>
by side, one af:er another or placed in a suitable<br>
manner adjacent to each other. As the filtering film<br>
it is naturally possible to use also other than PTM or<br>
TeM films being mentioned above, that are suitable for<br>
this purpose.<br>
It is naturally clear, that also the pipe arrangements<br>
as well as the valve arrangements may be carried out<br>
in most heterogeneous ways depending on how and in<br>
which connection the apparatus is being exploited. The<br>
valve arrangement may thus be carried out by valves<br>
acting mechanically or by pressurized medium and/or in<br>
addition to the above also by exploiting electricity,<br>
in case purifying apparatuses are desired, that may be<br>
controlled e.g. on so called remote control principle.<br>
Correspondingly the accessory purifying means may be<br>
placed in a cylindrical embodiment outside the cylin-<br>
der or in a planar embodiment inside the auxiliary<br>
frame. By placing the accessory filtering means at the<br>
opposite outer {surfaces of the planar filter cartridge<br>
e.g. by adapting planar structures therewith may make<br>
replacement of the means in question significantly<br>
easier, though the same being placed on the side of<br>
the dirty water are not as long lasting as the ones<br>
being placed on the clean water side.<br>
So, the advantageous embodiment shown in the drawings<br>
show mainly directive principles, in addition to which<br>
the apparatus according to the invention may be<br>
manufactured by many parts of the same by using most<br>
heterogeneous manufacturing techniques and materials,<br>
which matters have naturally influence to the ap-<br>
pearance and manufacturing costs of each structure<br>
being achieved at each time.<br><br><br>
