				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Silicon Ether Compounds and a Method for the Preparation thereof <br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to novel silicon ether compounds, a method for the preparation thereof and use thereof as a component of catalysts for olefins polymerization. In olefins polymerization or copolymerization, in particular, in propylene polymerization or copolymerization, catalyst systems comprising the silicon ether compounds as external electron donor component exhibit good hydrogen response, and can be used to prepare polymer having high isotacticity at high yield.<br>
Background Art<br>
Catalysts for olefins polymerization or copolymerization are well known in literatures. These catalysts typically comprise a transition metal-containing active component, generally comprising magnesium, titanium and halogen as main ingredients; a cocatalyst component, typically organo-aluminium compound; and external electron donor component, typically organo-silicon compound. For stereoelective polymerization of olefins, especially stereoelective polymerization of propylene, if no external electron donor component is used, most of these catalysts give a polymer having lower isotacticity, typically lower than 90%, so that they are not applicable to industrial scale production. Therefore, the addition of external electron donor component is often necessary.<br>
At present, the types of external electron donor compounds have developed from initial benzoates to current organosiloxane. For instance, WO 00/63261 discloses external electron donor compounds useful in olefins polymerization, i.e. silicon compounds having a general formula R11aR12bSi(OR13)c, wherein a and b are zero or integer of from 1 to 2, c is integer of from 1 to 3, and the sum of a+b+c is 4, R11, R12 and R13 are independently C1-C18 hydrocarbyl which optionally contains a heteroatom. The preferred are those silicon compounds in which a is 1, b is 1, c is 2, at least one of R11 and R12 is selected from the group consisting of branched alkyl, alkenyl, alkylene, cycloalkyl and aryl, having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and containing optionally a heteroatom, and R13 is C1-C10 alkyl, especially methyl, for example, cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane. The also preferred are those silicon compounds in which a is 0, c is 3, R12 is branched alkyl or cycloalkyl, containing optionally a heteroatom, and R13 is methyl, for example, cyclohexyltrimethoxysilane and the like.<br>
It is noted that, among the silicon compounds having the general formula R11aR12bSi(OR13)c, those silicon compounds in which c is 1 are generally not deemed as<br><br>
good	external	electron	donor.	In	the	prior	art,<br>
2,2-dihydrocarbyl-1-hydrocarbyloxy-3-(trihydrocarbylsilyloxy)propane compounds have never been used as external electron donor compounds in olefins polymerization. However, the inventors have surprisingly found that, when used as external electron donor in olefins polymerization, especially in propylene polymerization, silicon ether compounds of general formula (I), which will be described in detail hereinbelow, exhibit good properties, for instance, the catalyst systems exhibit good hydrogen response, and can be used to prepare polymer having high isotacticity at high yield.<br>
Description the invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide silicon ether compounds having general formula (I)<br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein, R1'-R4' groups, which are identical to or different from each other, represent<br>
linear or branched C1-C5 alkyl, phenyl or benzyl,<br>
with the priviso that<br>
when R1R2'R3'Si group represents tert-butyldimethylsilyl or tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, R4' is<br>
not benzyl; and<br>
when R4' is C1-C3 linear or branched alkyl, R1R21 and R3' are not simultaneously ethyl.<br>
Preferably, in the above general formula (II), R3' and R4' groups are independently methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
More preferably, in the above general formula (II), R1and R2' groups are methyl, and R3' and R4' groups are independently methyl, ethyl, or tert-butyl. Most preferably, R4' group is methyl or ethyl.<br>

To a reactor that had been completely purged with highly pure N2 were added successively 4.8g of magnesium dichloride, 95ml of toluene, 4ml of epichlorohydrin, and 12.5ml of tributyl phosphate. With stirring, the mixture was heated to 50°C and held at that temperature for 2.5 hours, thereby the solid was completely dissolved.

From the results shown in the Tables 1 and 2, it can be seen that, when the silicon ether compounds according to the present invention are used as external electron donor component of a catalyst for olefin polymerization, polymerization activity of the catalyst and isotacticity of the polymerization product obtained are satisfied. Furthermore, at the<br>
same hydrogen gas level, the polymerization using the silicon ether compounds according to the invention will give polymers having higher melt index than the polymerization using the silane compound commonly used in the art, and as the level of hydrogen gas increases, melt index increases more notably. These results sufficiently demonstrate that, when the silicon ether compounds according to the present invention are used as external electron donor component of a catalyst for olefin polymerization, the catalyst will exhibit relatively good hydrogen response, and this performance facilitates the development of various grades of polymers.<br>
The invention aims to develop novel external electron donor compounds useful in<br>
propylene	polymerization.	It	is	generally	accepted	that<br>
trihydrocarby-hydrocarbyloxy-silanes are not good external electron donors for olefin polymerization, and are not suitable for enhancing isotacticity of the polyolefin product. However, the inventors have found that, when using preferred silicon ether compounds of the invention substituting for cyclohexylmethyldimethoxysilane known in the art as external electron donor in olefin polymerization, a current catalyst remains its high catalytic activity, and exhibits good hydrogen response, and the prepared polypropylene has high isotacticity. These results prove that the silicon ether compounds of the invention are a class of highly effective external electron donor compounds.<br>

9.	A method for the preparation of the silicon ether compound as claimed<br>
in claim 1, comprising the step of:<br>
reacting a compound of the formula (III)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R4-R10 groups are as defined in claim 1,<br>
with a trihydrocarbylsilylating agent which can introduce -S1R1R2R3 group,<br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 groups are as defined in claim 1,<br>
in an aprotic inert solvent and, if needed, in the presence of a base, to form<br>
corresponding silicon ether compound of the formula (I), wherein equivalent<br>
ratio of the compound of formula (III) to the trihydrocarbylsilylating agent is in a<br>
range of from 1:1 to 1:1.2.<br><br>
10.	The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein the aprotic inert solvent is selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane, chloroform, benzene, toluene, n-hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, tert-butyl methyl ether, N,N-dimethyl formamide, and mixtures thereof.<br>
11.	The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein a trihydrocarbylsilyl halide is used as the trihydrocarbylsilylating agent, the reaction of the silylating agent and the compound of the formula (III) is carried out in the presence of a base, and the raw materials are charged at such amounts that molar ratio of the compound of the formula (III) : trihydrocarbylsilyl halide : base is in a range of 1 : 1-1.2: 1-1.2.<br>
12.	The method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the base is selected from the group consisting of Na, K, NaOH, KOH, NaH, KH, CaH2 Na2CO3, K2CO3, NH3, Et3N, Me3N, Bu3N, pyridine, imidazole, 4-dimethylaminopyhdine, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
13.	The method as claimed in claim 9, wherein a hexahydrocarbyl disilazane is used as the silylating agent, and the raw materials are charged at such amounts that molar ratio of the compound of the formula (III) to hexahydrocarbyl disilazane is in a range of 1 : 0.5-0.6.<br>
14.	A process comprising polymerizing olefins, with the silicon ether compound as claimed in claim 1 as an external electron donor compound.<br>
15.	The process as claimed in claim 14, wherein said process is homopolymerization or copolymerization of propylene.</td>
