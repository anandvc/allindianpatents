				<td>Description<br>
Control and communication system including at least one automation<br>
unit<br>
The invention refers to a control and communication system<br>
including at least one automation on unit being adapted to run<br>
an operation program, and an engineering unit being adapted<br>
to modify the operation program. Further, the invention refers<br>
to a method of modifying an operation program of at<br>
least one automation unit of a control and communication system,<br>
the control and communication system further including<br>
an engineering unit being adapted to modify the operation<br>
program of the corresponding automation unit.<br>
Automation of machinery equipment or plants, such as power<br>
plants, demands flexible and multi-purpose control and communication<br>
systems, in order to project the increasingly complex<br>
adjustment and control objects, in order to put them<br>
into operation and in order to adapt them to changing terms<br>
and conditions.<br>
Although many efforts have been made in order to receive such<br>
control and communication systems, known systems are still<br>
considered to include too many inflexible rules and to be too<br>
complicated in programming and modifying of the corresponding<br>
operation programs.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to pro-<br>
vide a control and communication system and a method for<br>
modifying an operation program of such a system, which are<br>
much easier to amend. Meanwhile, the system and method have<br>
to keep the presently known low standard of error probability<br>
and it should be possible to provide the system and the<br>
method on the basis of presently known automation units, such<br>
as those of the well known SIMATIC family.<br><br>
The object underlying the invention is solved by a control<br>
and communication eystezn including at least one automation<br>
unit being adapted to run an operation program, and an engineering<br>
unit being adapted to modify the operation program,<br>
the engineering unit including a code-configurator/ which is<br>
adapted to project automation functions of the operation program<br>
in the form of at least one configured data structure<br>
and to modify the configured data structure, the at least one<br>
automation unit including an interpreter framework, which is<br>
adapted to include a catalogue of predefined, necessary automation<br>
functions of the operation program and an empty data<br>
structure/ the interpreter framework being further adapted to<br>
interpret the modified configured data structure and to provid<br>
a modified operation program on the basis of at least<br>
one of the automation functions of said catalogue and the<br>
modified configured data structure. The configured data<br>
structure in particular contain pointers and values and is<br>
used in the interpreter framework to point at the relevant<br>
automation functions (already provided in the said catalogue<br>
of the interpreter framework) and to fill them with the appropriate<br>
values.<br>
In other words, the invention provides a projection of automation<br>
functions of an automation unit in the form of at<br>
least one configured data structure. This data structure just<br>
contains data, but no functions in the common form. The configured<br>
data structure is interpreted at the automation unit<br>
by assigning corresponding automation functions from a catalogue<br>
of automation functions, which was previously included<br>
at the automation unit. By doing so, the invention enables a<br>
modification of projected automation functions at automation<br>
units, which achieves very short times required for generating<br>
and downloading of the modifications.<br>
The solution according to the invention particularly suitable<br>
for control and communication systems of plants, such as<br>
power plants, in which the at least one automation unit and<br><br>
the engineering unit are each connected to a common communication<br>
bus of a peer-to-peer communication network.<br>
in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the eiigineeriuy<br>
unit is adapted to send the at least one modified configured<br>
data structure to the at least one automation unit by means<br>
of the corresponding interpreter framework. Accordingly, the<br>
interpreter framework additionally provides the functions of<br>
an interface between the engineering unit and the oorrespond-<br>
ing automation unit.<br>
Further preferred, the engineering unit is adapted to include<br>
a structural image of the operation system of the at least<br>
one automation unit. The structural image may serve as a basis<br>
for the projection of automation functions of the operation<br>
program of the corresponding automation unit in the form<br>
of said at least one configured data structure.<br>
The at least one automation unit is advantageously adapted to<br>
switch to the modified operation program while keeping the<br>
previous running operation program in a corresponding buffer.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the modified configured data<br>
structure is kept in a corresponding buffer of the engineering<br>
unit or the corresponding automation unit.<br>
The at least one automation unit further advantageously includes<br>
a running operation program and is adapted to switch<br>
to the modified operation program while running said operation<br>
system.<br>
The object of the invention is further solved by a method of<br>
modifying an operation program of an automation unit of a<br>
control and communication system, the control and communication<br>
system further including an engineering unit being<br>
adapted to modify the operation program, the mothod including<br>
the steps of projecting automation functions of the operation<br>
program in the form of at least one configured data structure<br><br>
and modifying the configured data structure in the engineering<br>
unit, providing a catalogue of predefined, necessary<br>
automation functions of the operation program and an empty<br>
data structure in the at least one automation unit, sending<br>
the modified configured data structure to the at least one<br>
automation unit, interpreting the modified configured data<br>
structure at the at least one automation unit, and providing<br>
a modified operation program at the at least one automation<br>
unit on the bases of at least one of the automation functions<br>
of said catalogue and the modified configured data structure.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment, said method includes the<br>
step of sending the modified configured data structure to the<br>
at least one automation unit by means of the automation, functions<br>
provided in the corresponding automation unit.<br>
In a second preferred embodiment, said method includes the<br>
step of including a structural image of the operation system<br>
of the at least one automation unit in the engineering unit.<br>
Further preferred, the method according to the invention includes<br>
the step of switching to the modified operation program<br>
in the at least one automation unit while keeping the<br>
previous running operation program in a corresponding buffer.<br>
Alan preferred, said method includes the step of runniny an<br>
operation program in the at least one automation unit and<br>
switching to the modified operation program while running<br>
said operation system.<br>
By means of the solution according to the invention a shock-<br>
free modification of operation programs in running automation<br>
units can be provided, i.e., the modification can be done<br>
without interruption or impact on the running process. New<br>
functions can be added to the process, internal switchings<br>
and parameters can be amended, and functions can be moved to<br>
other program cycles.<br><br>
Short "turnarounds" or switching times {according to the in<br>
vention only some seconds are typical) can be achieved for<br>
providing the modified operation program in the corresponding<br>
automation unit in an executable manner.<br>
At the automation unit even the previous operation program<br>
can be rebuild or restored in a shock-free manner after modifications<br>
had been made on the basis of the modified configured<br>
data structure. It is only necessary to switch to the<br>
old data structure, which points to the previous automation<br>
functions and includes values for the previous operation pro-<br>
gram.<br>
The solution of the invention further enables a simulation of<br>
any user-defined input and/or output values in process circuitry<br>
without loosing the possibility to display the actual<br>
process value of the equipment. The user defined value may be<br>
inserted in the configured data structure instead of the actual<br>
process value and may thus form the basis for a simulation<br>
of such value in the following automation function.<br>
A consistency check may be provided on the basis of the solution<br>
according to the invention, which allows to find inconsistencies,<br>
e.g. because of communication malfunctions or<br>
manually made amendments, before placing the projected modifications<br>
into the corresponding automation, unit.<br>
In addition, the invention provides the basis for an automatic<br>
dispatching of automation functions in corresponding<br>
timeframes, in order to receive a balanced processor load of<br>
the automation units for the different and various operation<br>
cycles.<br>
The communication between the engineering unit and the interpreter<br>
framework of the at least one automation unit acrording<br>
to the invention may further be used for a kind of inte-<br><br>
grated communication mechanism which allows to exchange process<br>
signals (in particular for operation of the automation<br>
units and/or for human/machine interfaces (hmi)) even across<br>
several automation units without needing an additional projection<br>
of such signal transfers.<br>
Further, said communication may be used for an integrated<br>
alarm handling of binary output signals without any additional<br>
circuit. The binary output signals may simply be addressed<br>
by an appropriate automation function which is to be<br>
included in the interpreter framework and may be paged there-<br>
after by a corresponding pointer in the configured data<br>
structure of the engineering unit.<br>
Finally, the solution according to the invention may provide<br>
an integrated quality code for each signal, in that the configured<br>
data structure does not only address a particular<br>
automation function but does further provide quality data for<br>
the corresponding signal which are used in the automation<br>
function for a quality check.<br>
Thus, according to the invention a completely new operation<br>
system was configured in the automation unit and a corresponding<br>
code generator was developed in the engineering<br>
unit. The projected automation functions are entirely described<br>
in the form of data, a time consuming generating of<br>
functions is not necessary. The automation unit interprets<br>
the configured data structures. The interpretation of the operation<br>
structures forms the core or basis for the realisation<br>
of functions of the operation program.<br>
The engineering system particularly receives a complete image<br>
of the operation structures deposited in the automation unit<br>
and configures the necessary data structures in the case of<br>
an activated projecting modification. Thereby all necessary<br>
amendments are transferred to the automation unit in parallel<br>
to the running operation program. upon consistent and com-<br><br>
plete transfer of all data, the engineering unit will switch<br>
the automation unit to the modified operation structure. In<br>
this way a negative impact on the running operation program<br>
can be ruled out.<br>
The interpreter framework is loaded once at the initialisation<br>
of the automation unit and provides its services thereafter.<br>
The engineering unit uses the services of the interpreter<br>
framework fox- the transfer of the configured projecting<br>
data, thereby defining the functioning of the interpreter<br>
framework. As the interpreter framework includes all necessary<br>
functions and also the empty data structures, an extensive<br>
loading of further data components during activation of<br>
the projecting structures is not needed.<br>

and<br>
Fig. 11 shows a diagrammatic depiction of the communication<br>
between the partners of the control and communication system<br>
according to Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1 a control and communication system 10 is shown,<br>
which includes an engineering unit 12 or server (Ft-server)<br>
and a number of automation units 14 in the form of SIMATIC S7<br>
control units (only one is shown in Fig. 1). The engineering<br>
unit 12 is operatively connected to the automation unit 14<br>
via a peer-to-peer network 16, wherein the communication includes<br>
four redundant channels 18, 20, 22 and 24 (channel-<br>
no. 0, 1, 2, 3; redundance-no. 0, 1). The units 12 and 14 are<br>
thereby each addressed by means of IP-addresses (IP-adr.) and<br>
the channels 18 to 2 4 are acccoible through appropriate<br>
ports (Port-no.) of the units 12 and 14.<br>
Via the first channel 18, the so called engineering-channel,<br>
signals, telegrams and/or jobs for the installation and modification<br>
of operation programs of the automation units 14 are<br>
transferred. The second channel 20, the so called operate-<br>
channel, serves for transferring signals, telegrams and/or<br>
jobs for the actual operation of the automation unit 14. The<br>
third channel 22, the so called hmi-channel, is used for a<br>
human/machine interface (hmi) between the engineerina unit 12<br>
and the corresponding automation unit 14. Finally, the forth<br><br>
channel 24, the so called alarm channel, provides alarm handling<br>
between the automation unit 14 and the engineering unit<br>
12.<br>
As will be described in further detail hereinafter, the channels<br>
18 to 24 provide a kind of integrated communication between<br>
the engineering unit 12 and the corresponding automation<br>
unit 14, which allows to exchange process signals (in<br>
particular for modifying operation programs, for operation of<br>
the automation units, for human/machine interfaces (hmi)<br>
and/ox for alarm signals) even across several automation<br>
units without needing an additional projection of such signal<br>
transfers.<br>
In Fig. 2a, 2b a list of those signals 26 (in the form of<br>
telegrams or jobs) is shown, which are transferred between<br>
the engineering unit 12 (Ft-server) and the corresponding<br>
automation unit 14 (programmable logical controller, PLC)<br>
during the installation and modification of operation programs<br>
of the automation unit 14.<br>
The signals 26 include, e.g., an initiation or activation of<br>
a new configuration of an automation program by means of a<br>
signal »£XECUTE». The signal is confirmed by the automation<br>
unit 16 with a telegram acknowledgement via a signal<br>
«TEL_ACK«. The telegram acknowledgement servco a an integrated<br>
quality code for providing a quality check of the communication.<br>
Fig. 3a and 3b show a list of those signals 26 which are<br>
transferred between the engineering unit 12 and the corre-<br>
sponding automation unit 14 during the actual operation of<br>
the automation unit 14. Fig. 4 shows the corresponding hu-<br>
man/machine interface signal transfer, and Fig. 5 shows the<br>
signal transfer in the case of an alarm during operation.<br><br>
In Fig. 6 a diagrammatic partial depiction of the method of<br>
modifying an operation program of the automation, unit 14 of<br>
the control and communication system 10 according to Fig. 1<br>
is shown.<br>
It is an important aspect of the method, that the new or<br>
modified operation program is not developed in its entirety<br>
at the engineering unit 12 and is transferred to the automation<br>
unit 14 thereafter, but that it is developed in the form<br>
of a configured data structure including just pointers and<br>
values, but not entire functions. The pointers and values are<br>
interpreted by a interpreter framework, which forms a part of<br>
the automation unit 14, but is not depicted in Fig. 6 in detail.<br>
Fig. 6 just shows the processes of this interpretation<br>
of the configured data structure provided by the engineering<br>
unit 12 in principle.<br>
First, the engineering unit 12 provides a number of data components<br>
(DB) at the interpreter framework of the automation<br>
unit 14, in particular a Global DB 28, a Cycle DB 30, a number<br>
of Sequence DBs 32, and a Module DB 34. When starting a<br>
new program execution {e.g., via the signal 26 «EXECUTE«)<br>
at a step 3b, first, an actual cycle DB number is read in a<br>
step 38 from the Global DB 28. Thereafter, an actual sequence<br>
DB number is read in a step 40 from the appropriate Cycle DB<br>
30. The next step 42 reads an actual module instance from the<br>
appropriate Sequence DB 32.<br>
Based on these information, an actual module instance is performed<br>
thereafter in a step 44, using data from the Module DB<br>
34 and providing outputs into Output rm* 46 (and an Instance<br>
DB) .<br>
The next steps 48a, 48b and 50a, 50b check whether the last<br>
module in the sequence list and/or the last Sequence DB 32<br>
are reached and repeat the appropriate steps 38 to 4.4, accordingly.<br><br>
Dy doing so, the actual automation functions of the operation<br>
program of the automation unit 14 are generated via an interpretation<br>
of the data structure of the data components 28,<br>
30, 32 and 34, which was provided (in a first-time or modified<br>
manner) by the engineering unit 12.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an above mentioned interpreter framework 52 in<br>
further details. The interpreter framework 52 includes a<br>
process 54 (RCvSnd) for receiving and sending data to a telegram<br>
buffer 56 (TelBuff). The telegram buffer 56 communicated<br>
with a process 58 (ProcEs) for processinq enqineerinq services.<br>
The process 58 handles the actual reading and writing<br>
of data components, such as a Cycle DB 30, a number of Se<br>
quence DBs 32, and a number of Module DBs 34. The process 58<br>
further addresses a number of Index DBs and a Force-DB 62 and<br>
writes data to the Output DBs 46. The corresponding telegrams<br>
are received by the interpreter framework 52 over the engineering<br>
channel 1ft and contain one or more jobs. These jobs<br>
are processed by the interpreter framework 52. In errorless<br>
case a positive acknowledgement telegram is sent back. E.g.,<br>
the answer for a signal or telegram DB_READ is a DB_CONTENT<br>
telegram.<br>
Fig. 8 to Fig. 10 are provided for further explaining the<br>
process of interpretation in the corresponding automation<br>
unit 14. The process is based on a configuration data component<br>
64 (config DB1), which includes an individualizing RC<br>
number and a base cycle. These data are processed takinq into<br>
account data from said Global DB 28 and the number of Cycle<br>
DBS 30. The included data are in particular information about<br>
the cycles to be processed and the sequences within the cycles.<br>
Further, the traffic in the peer-to-peer network is addressed<br>
via pear-to-peer (PtP) data components. The sequences<br>
refer via pointers (depicted by arrows) to modules Of the<br>
Module DBs 34, in which the actual instance data are stored.<br><br>
As finally summarized in Fig. 11, the catalogue of predefined<br>
necessary automation functions provided in the interpreter<br>
framework 52 in combination with the library of data components<br>
provided by the engineering unit 12 is thus translated<br>
via said sequence date, said cycle data and said instance<br>
data to a running operation program which is stored in a output<br>
binary DB 66, a output analogue DB 68 and an instance DB<br>
70.<br><br>
