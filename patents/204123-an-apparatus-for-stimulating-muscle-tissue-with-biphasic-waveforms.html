COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
An apparaties for stimulating muscle tissue with  liphasic wave forms. <br>
MOWER, MORTON, M. of 3 908 NORTH CHARLES STREET # 1001, BALTIMORE, MD 21218, U.S.A. , AMERICAN national<br>
The following specification- particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
AUGMENTATION OF MUSCLE CONTRACTILITY BY BIPHASIC STIMULATION<br>
RELATED APPLICATION DATA<br>
The present disclosure is a continuation-in-part application related to the U.S. Patent Application entitled "Electrical Conduction and Contractility by Biphasic Cardiac Pacing Administered Via the Cardiac Blood Pool," Serial No. 09/008,636, filed January 16, 1998, which is a continuation-in-part application related to the U.S. Application entitled "Augmentation of Electrical Conduction and Contractility by Biphasic Cardiac Pacing," Serial No. 08/699,552, filed August 8, 1996.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION      <br><br>
This invention relates generally to a method- for the stimulation of muscle tissue. In particular, this invention relates to a  for stimulation of muscle tissue with biphasic waveforms that reduce the electrical energy required to elicit contraction.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The function of the cardiovascular system is vital for survival. Through blood circulation, body tissues obtain necessary nutrients and oxygen, and discard waste substances. In the absence of the circulation, cells begin to undergo irreversible changes that lead to death. The muscular contractions of the heart are the driving force behind circulation.<br>
In cardiac muscle, the muscle fibers are interconnected in branching networks that spread in all directions through the heart. When any portion of this net is stimulated, a depolarization wave passes to all of its parts and the entire structrue contracts as a unit. Before a muscle fiber can be stimulated to contract, its membrane must be polarized. A muscle fiber generally remains polarized until it is stimulated by some change in its environment. A membrane can be stimulated electrically, chemically, mechanically or by temperature change. The minimal stimlation strength needed to elicit a contraction is known as the threshold stimulus. The maximum stimulation amplitude that may be administered without eliciting a contraction is the maximum subthreshold amplitude.<br><br>
Where the membrane is stimulated electrically, the impulse amplitude required to elicit a response is dependent upon a number of factors. First, is the duration of current flow. Since the total charge transferred is equal to the current amplitude times the pulse duration, increased stimulus duration is associated with a decrease in threshold current amplitude. Second, the percentage of applied current that actually traverses the membrane varies inversely with electrode size. Third, the percentage of applied current that actually traverses the membrane varies directly with the proximity of the electrode to the issue. Fourth, the impulse amplitude required to elicit a response is dependent upon the timing of stimulation within the excitability cycle.<br>
Throughout much of the heart are clumps and strands of specialized cardiac muscle tissue. This tissue comprises the cardiac conduction system and serves to initiate and distribute depolarization waves throughout the myocardium. Any interference or block in cardiac impulse conduction may cause an arrhythmia or marked change in the rate or rhythm of the heart.<br>
Sometimes a patient suffering from a conduction disorder can be helped by an artificial pacemaker. Such a device contains a small battery powered electrical stimulator. When the artificial pacemaker is installed, electrodes are generally threaded through veins into the right ventricle, or into the right atrium and right ventricle,and the stimulator is planted beneath the skin in the shoulder or abdomen. The leads are planted in intimate contact with the cardiac tissue. The pacemaker then transmits rhythmic electrical impulses to the heart, and the myocardium responds by contracting rhythmically. Implantable medical devices for the pacing of the heart are well known in the art and have ben used in humans since approximately the mid 1960s.<br>
Either cathodal or anodal current may be used to stimulate the myocardium. However anodal current is thought not to be useful clinically. Cathodal current comprises electrical pulses of negative polarity. This type of current depolarizes the cell membrane by discharging the membrane capacitor, and directly reduces the membrane potential toward threshold level. Cathodal current, by directly reducing the resting membrane potential toward threshold, has a one-half to one-third lower threshold current in late diastole than does anodal current.Anode current comprises electrical pulses of positive polarity. The effect of anodal current is to hyperpolarize the resting membrane. On sudden termination of the anodal pulse, the membrane<br><br>
potential returns towards resting level, overshoots to threshold, and a propagated response occurs. The use of anodal current to stimulate the myocardium is generally discouraged due to the higher stimulation threshold, which leads to use of a higher current, resulting in a drain on the battery of an implanted device and impaired longevity. Additionally, the use of anodal current for cardiac stimulation is discouraged due to the suspicion that the anodal contribution to depolarization can, particularly at higher voltages, contribute to arrhythmogeriesis.<br>
Virtually all artificial pacemaking is done using stimulating pulses of negative polarity, or in the case of bipolar systems, the cathode is closer to the myocardium than is the anode. Where the use of anodal current is disclosed, it is generally as a charge of minute magnitude used to dissipate residual charge on the electrode. This does not affect or condition the myocardium itself. Such a use is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,543,956 to Herscovici.<br>
The use of a triphasic wave form has been disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,903,700 and 4,821,724 to Whigham et al., and U.S. Patent No. 4,343,312 to Cals et al. Here, the first and third phases have nothing to do with the myocardium per se, but are only envisioned to affect the electrode surface itself. Thus, the charge applied in these phases is of very low amplitude.<br>
Lastly, biphasic stimulation is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,402,322 to Duggan. The goal of this disclosure is to produce voltage doubling without the need for a large capacitor in the output circuit. The phases of the biphasic stimulation disclosed are of equal magnitude and duration.<br>
What is needed is an improved means for stimulating muscle tissue, wherein the contraction elicited is enhanced and the damege to the tissue adjacent to the electrode is diminished.<br>
Enhanced myocardial function is obtained through the biphasic pacing of the present invention. The combination of cathodal with anodal pulses of either a stimulating or conditioning nature, preserves the improved conduction and contractility of anodal pacing while eliminating the drawback of increased stimulation threshold. The result is a depolarization wave of increased propagation speed. This increased propagation speed results in superior cardiac contraction<br><br>
leading to an improvement in blood flow. Improved stimulation at a lower voltage level also results in reduction in power consumption and increased life for pacemaker batteries.<br>
As with the cardiac muscle, striated muscle may also be stimulated electrically, chemically, mechanically or by temperature change. Where the muscle fiber is stimulated by a motor nueron, the neuron transmits an impulse which activates all of the muscle fibers within its control, that is, those muscle fibers in its motor unit. Depolarization in one region of the membrane stimulates adjacent regions to depolarize as well, resulting in a wave of depolarization traveling over the membrane in all directions away from the site of stimulation. Thus, when a motor neuron transmits an impulse, all the muscle fibers in its motor unit are stimulated to contract simultaneously.<br>
The minimum strength to elicit a contraction is called the threshold stimulus. Once this level of stimulation has been met, the generally held belief is that increasing the level will not increase the contraction. Additonally, since the muscle fibers within each muscle are organized into motor units, and each motor unit is controlled by a single motor neuron, all of the muscle fibers in a motor unit are stimulated at the same time. However, the whole muscle is controlled by many different motor units that respond to different stimulation thresholds. Thus, when a given stimulus is applied to a muscle, some motor units may respond while others may not.<br>
The combination of cathodal and anodal pulses of the present invention also provides improved contraction of striated muscle where electrical muscular stimulation is indicated due to neural or muscular damage. Where nerve fibers have been damaged due to trauma or disease, muscle fibers in the regions supplied by the damaged nerve fiber tend to undergo atrophy and waste away. A muscle that cannot be exercised may decrease to half of its usual size in a few months. Where there is no stimulation, not only will the muscle fibers decrease in size, but they will become fragmented and degenerated, and replaced by connective tissue. Through electrical stimulation, one may maintain muscle tone such that upon healing or regeneration of the nerve fiber, viable muscle tissue remains, and the overall regenerative process is thereby enhanced and assisted.<br><br>
Striated muscle stimulation can also serve to preserve the neural pathway, such that, upon healing of the nerve fibers associated with the stimulated tissue, the patient "remembers" how to contract that particular muscle. Enhanced striated muscle contraction is obtained through the biphasic stimulation of the present invention. The combination of cathodal with anodal pulses of either a stimulating or conditioning nature results in contraction of a greater number of motor units at a lower voltage level, leading to superior muscle response.<br>
Lastly, biphasic stimulation as provided by the present invention may be desirable to stimulate smooth muscle tissue, such as those muscles responsible for the movements that force food through the digestive tube, constrict blood vessels and empty the urinary bladder. For example, appropriate stimulation could rectify the difficulties associated with incontinence.<br>

Stimulation and propagation characteristics of the myocardium were studied in isolated hearts using pulses of differing polarities and phases. The experiments were carried out in five isolated |Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts. Conduction velocity on the epicardium was measured using an array of bipolar electrodes. Measurements were made between six millimeters and nine millimeters from the stimulation site. Transmembrane potential was recorded using a floating intracellular microelectrode. The following protocols were examined monophasic cathodal pulse, monophasic anodal pulse, leading cathodal biphasic pulse, and leading anodal biphasic pulse.<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
The effects of varying pacing protocols on cardiac electrophysiology were analyzed using Langendorff prepared isolated rabbit hearts. Stimulation was applid to the heart at a constant voltage rectangular pulse. The following protocols were examined: monophasic anodal pulse, monophasic cathodal pulse, leading anodal biphasic pulse, and leading cathodal biphasic pulse. Administered voltage was increased in one volt steps from one to five volts for both anodal and<br><br>
cathodal stimulation. Duration was increased in two millisecond steps from two to ten milliseconds. Epicardial conduction velocities were measured along and transverse to the left ventricular fiber direction at a distance between three to six millimeters from the left ventricular free wall. Figs. 6 and 7 depict the effects of stimulation pulse duration and the protocol of stimulation administered on the conduction velocities.<br>
Fig. 6 depicts the velocities measured between three millimeters and six millimeters transverse to the fiber direction. In this region, cathodal monophasic stimulation 602 demonstrates the slowest conduction velocity for each stimulation pulse duration tested. This is followed by anodal monophasic stimulation 604 and leading cathodal biphasic stimulation 606. The fastest conduction velocity is demonstrated by leading anodal biphasic stimulation 608.<br>
Fig. 7 depicts the velocities measured between three-millimeters and six millimeters parallel to the fiber direction. In this region, cathodal monophasic stimulation 702 demonstrates the slowest conduction velocity for each stimulation pulse duration tested. Velocity results of anodal monophasic stimulaton 704 and leading cathodal biphasic stimulation 706 are similar to those with anodal monophasic stimulation , but demonstrating slightly quicker speeds. The fastest conduction velocity is demonstrated by leading anodal biphasic stimulation 708.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, electrical stimulation is administered to the cardiac muscle. The anodal stimulaton component of biphasic electrical stimulation augments cardiac contractility by hperpolarizing the tissue prior to excitation, leading to faster impulse conduction, more intracellular calcium release, and the resulting superior cardiac contraction. The cathodal stimulaton component eliminates the drawbacks of anodal stimulation, resulting in effective cardiac stimulation at a lower voltage level than wold be required with anodal stimulation alone. This, in turn, extends pacemaker battery life and reduces tissue damage.<br>
In a second aspect of the invention, biphasic electrical stimulation is administered to the cardiac blood pool, that is, the blood entering and surrounding the heart. This enables cardiac stimulation without the necessity of placing electrical leads in intimate contact with cardiac tissue, thereby diminishing the likelihood of damage to this tissue. The stimulation threshold of biphasic<br><br>
stimulaton administered via the blood pool is in the same range as standard stimuli delivered directly to the heart muscle. Through the use of biphasic electrical stimulation to the cardiac blood pool it is therefore possible to achieve enhanced cardiac contraction, without skeletal muscle contraction, cardiac muscle damage or adverse effects to the blood pool.<br>
In a third aspect of the invention, biphasic electrical stimulaton is applied to striated (skeletal) muscle tisue. The combination of anodal with cathodal stimulation results in the contraction of a greater number of muscle motor units at lower levels of voltage and/or electrical current, resulting in improved muscle response. The benefits of the present invention are realized both when there is direct stimulation, as well as when the stimulation is indirect (through the skin). Benefits may be realized in physical therapy and muscle rehabilitation contexts, for example, stimulation of muscles over time while waiting for damaged nerves to regenerate.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the invention, biphasic electrical stimulaton is applied to smooth muscle tissue. Visceral smooth muscle is found in the walls of hollow visceral organs such as the stomach, intestines, urinary bladder and uterus. The fibers of smooth muscles are capable of stimulating each other. Thus, once one fiber is stimulated, the depolarization wave moving over its surface may excite adjacent fibers, which in turn stimulate still others. Benefits of such stimulation can be realized, for example, in situations where incontinence has been caused by trauma or disease.<br>
Having thus described the basic concept of the invention, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing detailed disclosure is intended to be presented by way of example only, and is not limiting. Various alterations, improvements and modifications will occur and are intended to those skilled in the art, but are not expressly stated herein. These modifications, alterations and improvements are intended to be suggested hereby, and within the scope of the invention. Further, the stimulating pulses described in this specification are well within the capabilities of existing electronics with appropriate programming. Biphasic stimulation as provided by the present invention may be desirable in additional situations where electrical stimulation is indicated; such as nerve tissue stimulation and bone tissue stimulation.<br><br>
