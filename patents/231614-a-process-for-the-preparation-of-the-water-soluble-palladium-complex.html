				<td>A water soluble palladium complex and a process for the preparation of the same<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a water soluble palladium complex. More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a water soluble palladium complex of the general formula 1,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula I<br>
being an anionic chelating ligand containing an N donor and a O group, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are substituents of phosphine ligand at least one of which carries a sulfonic acid or salt there of and X is a sulfonato, carboxylato or formato group, or any of the halides and supported aqueous phase catalysts thereof. The water soluble palladium complexes and supported aqueous phase catalysts prepared by the process of the present invention are useful as efficient catalysts for reactions such as carbonylation, oxidation, hydrogenation, coupling, alkylation, oligomerization, polymerization.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Water soluble palladium complexes play an important role as catalysts for several organic transformations. One method in which such water soluble catalysts can be used is in biphasic systems; comprising the water soluble organometallic complex catalyst in aqueous phase and organic reactants and products as a water immiscible phase; thereby providing easy separation and reuse of the catalyst owing to the immiscibility of the catalyst phase with the organic substrates and products (U.S. 31812; Kuntz E.G. CHEMTECH 17, 1987, 570; EP 0107006; B. Cornils, W.A Herrmann (Eds.), Aqueous-Phase Organometallic Catalysis, Wiley-VCH, 1998, Weinheim.) Another approach is an supported aqueous hase catalysts (US 5736980, US 5935892) in which the catalytic material consists of a thin aqueous film containing the water soluble metal comlex catalyst spread over a high surface area inorganic support, such as silica (J.P. Arhancet, M.E. Davis, J.S. Merola, Be. Handon, Nature, 339, 1989, 454; K.T. Wan, M.E. Davis, Nature, 370,1994,449; K.T. Wan, M.E. Davis, J. Catal., 148,1994,1). US Patent 6069253 discloses the preparation of an anionic chelating ligand containing a N donor and O group.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide water soluble palladium complexes and supported aqueous phase catalysts thereof that are useful catalysts for a variety or organic transformations such as carbonylation, oxidation, hydrogenation, coupling, alkylation, oligomerization, polymerization.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the preparation of novel<br>
