DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Generally described, the present invention relates to an extensible file system format and various processes associated with the extensible file system format. In an illustrative embodiment, the extensible file system format corresponds to an extensible file system format for portable storage media and various processes associated with the extensible file system format on the portable storage media. Although the present invention will be described with regard to a portable storage media file system format, one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the disclosed embodiments are illustrative in nature and should not be construed as limiting. Additionally, one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the data structures and data layouts used in the illustrative examples may require additional information related to performance, security, and the like.<br>
FIGURES 1A-1C are block diagrams illustrative of various operating environments 100 for the extensible file system format of the present invention. With reference to FIGURE 1A, in an illustrative embodiment, the extensible file system format is utilized to store data from a computing device, such as a mobile computing device 102, and a storage media, such as a portable storage media 104. In an illustrative embodiment, the mobile computing device 102 can correspond to any one of a variety of computing devices, including but not limited to, portable computing devices, mobile telephones, personal digital assistants, music players, media players. The portable storage media can also include, but is not limited to, hard drives, flash media, micro-drives and other storage media. In an illustrative embodiment, the extensible file system on the portable storage media 104 does not have to include any type of executable or readable software components, such as an operating environment, utilized by the mobile computing device 102. Alternatively, the extensible file system on the portable storage media 104 may include executable or readable software components used by the mobile device 102.<br>
In an illustrative embodiment, the mobile computing device 102 may be in communication with other computing devices for collecting/exchanging data to be stored on the portable storage media 104. With reference to FIGURE IB, the mobile computing device 102 may be in direct communication with another computing device 106 and storage media 108. In an illustrative embodiment, the direct communication can correspond to various wired and wireless communication methods.   In an illustrative<br>
embodiment, the other storage media 108 is not required to be formatted in accordance with the extensible file system format of the present invention. With reference to FIGURE 1C, in a similar manner, the mobile computing device 102 may also be in communication with another computing device 110 and storage media 112, via a network connection. In an illustrative embodiment, the network connection can correspond to local area network (LAN) and wide are network (WAN) connections.<br>
With reference now to FIGURE 2, an illustrative embodiment volume layout 200 for an extensible file system format will be described. The volume layout 200 includes a boot parameters component 202 that include various information related to a description of the file system parameters of the partition. In an illustrative embodiment, the boot parameters component 202 can include code for bootstrapping from a defined partition, fundamental file system parameters for the defined partition, and various error checking information. A data structure for defining at least a portion of the boot parameters will be described below with regard to FIGURE 4.<br>
The volume layout 200 also includes an extensible parameters component, designated as OEM parameters 204, that define various additional data structures used in conjunction with the file system. In an illustrative embodiment, an original equipment manufacture (OEM) may specify various extensible data structures, such as performance parameters for a storage medium, that can be defined at time of manufacture. The volume layout 200 can further include a file allocation table component 206 that defines file and directory allocations. In an illustrative embodiment, each entry in the file allocation table component 206 corresponds to a 32-bit entry that represents an allocated cluster, an unallocated cluster or an unusable cluster. The volume layout 200 can still further include series of file data components 208A-208X that correspond to the data stored according to the file system format. Various data structures for defining a portion of the file data components 208A-208X will be defined with regard to FIGURES 3-10.<br>
Turning now to FIGURE 3, in one aspect, the file data components 208 may include one or more directory entries according to a directory structure 300. In an illustrative embodiment, directory structure 300 is organized into primary directory entries 302 and secondary directory entries 304. Each directory entry in the primary and secondary entries is typed. For example, in an illustrative embodiment, type values for the primary and secondary directory entries can correspond to a range of 1-255. Primary<br>
directory entries 302 correspond to the entries in the root directory of the file system. Secondary directory entries 304 follow a primary directory entry and are associated with the primary directory entry. Secondary directory entries extend the metadata associated with the correlated primary directory entry.<br>
With continued reference to FIGURE 3, in an illustrative embodiment, the primary directory entries 302 can be further classified as critical primary directory entries 306 and benign primary directory entries 308. Critical primary directory entries 306 define potentially different formats for each directory entry. In an illustrative embodiment, an operating environment will not mount a volume corresponding to the extensible file system format with an unknown critical primary directory entry, as will be described below. Examples of known primary directory entries 306 can include allocation bitmaps, up-case tables, volume labels, encryption keys, and normal directory entries. Benign primary directory entries 308 also define potential different formats for each directory entry, but can be ignored by the file system if a particular benign primary directory entry is not understood. Benign primary directory entries 308 can be associated with another cluster chain the volume. Additionally, benign primary directory entries 308 can also be associated a number of secondary directory entries 304.<br>
In a manner similar to primary directory entries 302, secondary directory entries 304 may also be further classified as critical secondary directory entries 310 and benign secondary directory entries 312. As described above, the critical secondary directory entries 310 and benign secondary directory entries 312 are associated with a benign primary directory entry and extend the metadata associated with the primary directory entry. Both the critical secondary directory entries 310 and the benign secondary directory entries 312 can be associated with another cluster chain the volume.<br>
To mount a corresponding to the extensible file system format, the file system implements a mount volume procedure. In an illustrative embodiment, the mount volume procedure attempts to a look at a version number for the volume. If the version number is not understood (e.g., the version number is higher), the volume will not be mounted. During a normal directory enumeration, any critical primary directory entries not known by the file system will prevent the volume from being mounted. Thereafter, various user-initiated processes, such as a file open, will cause the file system to enumerate the secondary directory entries. If the critical secondary directory entries 310 are not known<br>
by a file system, the entire directory entry will be skipped. Additionally, if benign secondary directory entries 312 are not known by the file system, the particular unknown benign secondary directory entry will be ignored.<br>
With reference now to FIGURE 4, a block diagram illustrative of data components 400 for implementing a boot process block in the boot parameters component 202 (FIGURE 2) will be described. The data components 400 include an OEM name component 402 for specifying a name for the file system format of the storage media. The data components 400 also include a data size descriptor component 404 for specifying various characteristics of the data stored in the file system. For example, the data size descriptor component 404 can specify a count of bytes per sector, a number of sectors per allocation unit, a FAT table offset, and a count of sectors for all data structures. The data components include an active FAT flags component 406 for specifying a number of active FATs on the file system. In an illustrative embodiment, a file system may support multiple FATs for utilization with some operating system environments. The data components 400 can further include a volume identification component 408 for identifying a volume serial number and/or version number. Still further, the data components 400 can include a file system type for specifying the file system format for the file system. One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the data components 400 can include a number of additional/alternative rows for implementing the above-identified components 402-410 and additional components.<br>
Turning now to FIGURE 5, a block diagram illustrative of data components 500 for implementing directory entries in an extensible file system format will be described. Turning now to FIGURE 6, a block diagram data components 500 for implementing a file name and extensions will be described. The data components 500 include an in use component 502 for specifying whether the particular directory entry is in use. In an illustrative embodiment, the high bit of the data components will be set to "1" if the directory entry is in use.

ows for implementing the above-identified components 702-708 and additional components. Additionally, in an illustrative embodiment, the data components 700 correspond to a benign directory entry that can be ignored by a file system that does not support volume identifiers.<br>
With reference now to FIGURES 8 and 9, in an illustrative embodiment, parties, such as an OEM, may be able to define specific benign primary directory entry types 308 and benign secondary directory entry types 312. As discussed above, in the event the file system would not recognize or understand either the specific benign primary directory entry types 308 or benign secondary directory entry types 312, the file system could ignore the defined directory entry types.<br>
With reference to FIGURE 8, a block diagram illustrative of data components 800 for implementing an extensible benign primary directory entry 308 in an extensible file system format will be described.

With reference now to FIGURE 11, a file name creation routine 1100 for an extensible file system format will be described. At block 1102, a file system obtains a request to create a directory entry with a specific file name. In an illustrative embodiment, the specific file name can correspond to a naming convention, such as a digital camera picture naming convention. At block 1104, the file system generates a target name hash. At block 1106, an iterative loop is begun by examining the next directory entry hash value. An illustrative directory entry type for storing directory entry hash values is described above with regard to data components 600 (FIGURE 6).<br>
At decision block 1108, a test is conducted to determine whether the target hash value matches the current directory entry hash value. If they do not match, the routine 1100 returns to block 1106 (until all the directory entries have been examined. If the hash values match at decision block 1108, at block 1110, the file system obtains the full file name for the potentially matching directory entry. An illustrative directory entry<br>
type for storing directory entry full file names is described above with regard to data components 600 (FIGURE 6). At decision block 1112, a test is conducted to determine whether the target file name matches the full file name of the potentially matching directory entry. If so, the routine 1100 terminates by reporting a conflict and the file system will be required to select a new file name. If the full file does not match, the routine 1100 will return to block 1106 to continue checking hash values for all the directory entries in the file system.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, various additional functionality may be added through the specification of specific directory types. For example, name streams may be supported by specifying a name stream directory entry. Additionally, on-disk encryption may also be supported through the utilization of specific encryption algorithms and key exchanges. Still further, time zone conversions may be associated with directory entries to automatically convert a current time zone with a time zone with the directory entry was made.<br>
While illustrative embodiments have been illustrated and described, it will be appreciated that various changes can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
