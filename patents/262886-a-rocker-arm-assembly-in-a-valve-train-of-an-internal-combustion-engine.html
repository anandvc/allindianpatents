				<td>ROCKER ARM ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to rocker arm assemblies, and<br>
more particularly to a two step rocker arm assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may or may not constitute prior<br>
art.<br>
[0003] Internal combustion engines include an arrangement of pistons<br>
and cylinders located within an engine block. Each cylinder has at least two<br>
valves. These valves control the flow of air to the combustion cylinders and allow<br>
for venting of combustion exhaust gasses. A valve train is used to selectively<br>
open and close these valves. In some valve trains, it is desirable to control the<br>
degree that the valves are opened or closed (i.e., the amount the valve travels).<br>
In order to selectively control the valve lift, a 2-step rocker arm assembly is<br>
connected to the valve and actuated by a camshaft.<br>
[0004] A typical 2-step rocker arm assembly includes an inner and an<br>
outer rocker arm actuated by the camshaft. The camshaft typically includes a<br>
low-lift cam and a high-lift cam. The camshaft engages the inner and outer<br>
rollers of the rocker arm assembly which in turn selectively positions the<br>
connected valve between a low-lift mode and a high-lift mode. The low-lift mode<br><br>
causes the valve to travel a first distance and the high-lift mode causes the valve<br>
to travel a second distance that is greater than the first distance. While useful for<br>
its intended purpose, there is room in the art for an improved rocker arm<br>
assembly having improved features to aid in manufacturability.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0037] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
[0038] With reference to FIG. 1, a portion of an exemplary internal<br>
combustion engine is indicated by reference number 10. The engine 10<br>
generally includes a cylinder head 12 that caps a plurality of cylinders (not<br>
shown) within the engine 10. A valve train 14 is mounted to the cylinder head 12.<br>
The valve train 14 generally includes a valve 18, a rocker arm assembly 20, and<br>
a camshaft 22. The valve 18 extends through the cylinder head 12 and into one<br>
of the cylinders (not shown) of the engine 10. The valve 18 is operable to<br>
selectively open and close to allow intake air to enter the cylinder (in the case of<br><br>
an intake valve) or to allow exhaust to exit the cylinder (in the case of an exhaust<br>
valve). The valve 18 is biased into the closed position by a valve spring 24.<br>
[0039] The camshaft 22 is mounted to the cylinder head 12 by a cam<br>
cap 26. The camshaft 22 includes a first high-lift cam 28, a second high-lift cam<br>
30, and a low-lift cam 32 located between the first and second high-lift cams 28<br>
and 30. The rocker arm assembly 20 is located beneath the camshaft 22 and is<br>
coupled to the valve 18 at one end by a valve pad 34 and coupled to the cylinder<br>
head 12 at an opposite end by a lash adjuster 36. As will be described in greater<br>
detail below, the camshaft 22 is operable to engage the rocker arm assembly 20<br>
to selectively open and close the valve 18.<br>
[0040] Turning to FIG. 2, the rocker arm assembly 20 will now be<br>
generally described, followed by a more detailed description of specific<br>
components. The rocker arm assembly 20 is known as having two steps or<br>
modes of operation that allow selective opening of the valve 18, as will be<br>
described in greater detail below. The rocker arm assembly 20 generally<br>
includes a lever body 40 that supports a first roller assembly 42, a second roller<br>
assembly 44, and a third roller assembly 46. The roller assemblies 42, 44, and<br>
46 are preferably bearings having inner and outer rollers, but it should be<br>
appreciated that various other kinds of roller assemblies may be employed<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. The first and second<br>
roller assemblies 42 and 44 are supported on a center shaft 48 that extends<br>
through the lever body 40. The center shaft 48 is generally cylindrical and<br>
includes open ends 49. A first washer 50 is mounted on the center shaft 48 and<br><br>
is located between the first roller assembly 42 and the lever body 40. A second<br>
washer 52 is also mounted on the center shaft 48 and is located between the<br>
second roller assembly 44 and the lever body 40.<br>
[0041] The center shaft 48 is supported within an opening 53 formed in<br>
a center bearing 54. The center bearing 54 is generally cylindrical and is<br>
supported by the third roller assembly 46 which is in turn supported by the lever<br>
body 40. The third roller assembly 46 is positioned such that it is located<br>
between the first and second roller assemblies 42 and 44.<br>
[0042] The rocker arm assembly 20 further includes a latch pin 56 and<br>
a distance sleeve 58. The latch pin 56 is coupled at one end of the lever body 40<br>
by a latch retainer 60. The latch pin 56 is hydraulically actuatable by the lash<br>
adjuster 36 and is moveable between a retracted position and an extended<br>
position, as will be described in greater detail below. The distance sleeve 60<br>
extends through an opposite end of the lever body 40. The distance sleeve 60 is<br>
capped at both ends by distance sleeve caps 62. The distance sleeve caps 62<br>
each define openings 63 at ends thereof.<br>
[0043] A coupling lever 64 is supported at one end by the distance<br>
sleeve 60 and through the center by the center shaft 48. A pair of spring levers<br>
66 are likewise supported by the distance sleeve 60 and by the center shaft 48.<br>
The spring levers 66 form the opposite sides of the rocker arm assembly 20. A<br>
spring member 68 is supported by the lever body 40 and engages the pair of<br>
spring levers 60.<br><br>
[0044] With reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B, the lever body 40 will now<br>
be described in further detail. The lever body 40 includes a pair of parallel,<br>
spaced-apart arms 70 that extend out from a body 72. The arms 70 cooperate<br>
with the body 72 to define a center opening 74 that extends through the lever<br>
body 40 from a first side 75 to a second side 77. The center opening 74 is sized<br>
to receive the third roller assembly 46 and the center bearing 54 therein. The<br>
center opening 74 includes a key cutout 76 formed in one of the pair of arms 70.<br>
The key cutout 76 is sized to receive a key (not shown) coupled to the center<br>
bearing 54 in order to orient the center bearing 54 with respect to the lever body<br>
40 and to prevent the center bearing 54 from rotating.<br>
[0045] A first opening 78 is formed through the lever body 40 extending<br>
from the first side 75 to the second side 77. The first opening 78 is generally<br>
cylindrical in shape and is sized to receive the latch pin 56 and latch retainer 60<br>
therein. A slot 79 is formed within the first opening 78 that extends through the<br>
body 72 to a bottom side 80 of the lever body 40. The slot 79 allows the lash<br>
adjuster to connect with the latch pin 56 in order to hydraulically actuate the latch<br>
pin 56. An annular or tubular projection 81 surrounds the first opening 78 on the<br>
first side 75 of the lever body 40.<br>
[0046] A second opening 82 is formed through the arms 70 from the<br>
first side 75 to the second side 77 of the lever body 40. The second opening 82<br>
is positioned such that the center opening 74 is located between the first opening<br>
78 and the second opening 82. The second opening 82 is sized to receive the<br>
distance sleeve 58 therethrough. The distance sleeve caps 62 abut the first and<br><br>
second sides 75, 77 of the lever body 40 (as best seen in FIG. 2) such that the<br>
distance sleeve 58 is restricted from moving out of the second opening 82.<br>
[0047] The arms 70 each define an "L"-shaped spring retainer portion<br>
84 on a top surface 86 of the lever body 40. As will be described in greater detail<br>
below, the spring retainer portion 84 acts to support and hold the spring member<br>
68.<br>
[0048] With reference to FIGS. 4A-B, the latch pin 56 generally<br>
includes a cylindrical body 90. The cylindrical body 90 defines a center hole 92<br>
that extends from a first end 94 to a second end 96. The first end 94 includes a<br>
concentric annulus or ring 98 that extends around the center hole 92. The<br>
second end 96 is flat in order to simplify the manufacturability of the latch pin 56.<br>
As noted above, the latch pin 56 is hydraulically actuatable by the lash adjuster<br>
36 and is moveable between a retracted position and an extended position. The<br>
latch pin 56 forms part of a latch assembly that may further include a spring (not<br>
shown) operable to bias the latch pin 56 into the retracted position.<br>
[0049] With reference to FIGS. 5A and 5B, the coupling lever 64 will<br>
now be described in detail. The coupling lever 64 includes a generally planar<br>
body 100 including a lever arm 102 extending in a first direction and a lock tab<br>
104 extending from the body 100 in an opposite direction. The lock tab 104 is<br>
operable to abut the latch pin 56 when the latch pin 56 is in the extended<br>
position, as will be described in greater detail below.<br>
[0050] A first hole 106 is formed through the coupling lever 64 at an<br>
end of the lever arm 102. The first hole 106 is receives the distance sleeve 58<br><br>
therethrough. The first hole 106 has an enlarged shape such that the distance<br>
sleeve 58 is able to slightly move freely therein relative to the coupling lever 64.<br>
The coupling lever 64 is positioned flush against the second side 77 of the lever<br>
body 40 (FIG. 3A). The first hole 106 defines a pivot axis for the coupling lever<br>
64 to pivot about the distance sleeve 58.<br>
[0051] A second hole 108 is formed through the body 100 of the<br>
coupling lever 64. The second hole 108 is sized to receive the center shaft 48<br>
therethrough. The coupling lever 64 is positioned such that it is between the<br>
lever body 40 and the washer 52 and second bearing 44 (FIG. 2). In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the coupling lever 64 is a stamped steel piece with spot<br>
machining. However, it should be appreciated that various other kinds of<br>
methods may be employed to create the coupling lever 64 without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0052] Turning to FIGS. 6A and 6B, the spring lever 66 will now be<br>
described in greater detail. While two spring levers 66 are employed with the<br>
rocker arm assembly 20, only one will be described as the spring levers 66 are<br>
identical. The spring lever 66 includes an inner face 120 and an outer face 122.<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 2, the inner face 120 is configured to abut the<br>
lever body 40. The spring lever 66 includes a frusto-conical mounting portion<br>
124 that extends out from the inner face 120 at an end thereof. The mounting<br>
portion 124 defines a hole 126 that extends through the spring lever 66 from the<br>
inner face 120 to the outer face 122. The mounting portion 124 is sized to fit<br>
within the opening 63 of the distance sleeve caps 62 (FIG. 2) and is secured<br><br>
thereto by a fastener (not shown). The spring lever 66 is rotatable about the<br>
distance sleeve 58 and accordingly shares the same pivot point as the coupling<br>
lever 64.<br>
[0053] A tab 128 extends out from the inner face 120 at an end<br>
opposite the mounting portion 124. The tab 128 defines a hole 130 that extends<br>
through the spring lever 66 from the inner face 120 to the outer face 122. The<br>
tab 128 is sized to fit within the opening 49 of the center shaft 48 (FIG. 2) and is<br>
secured thereto by a fastener (not shown).<br>
[0054] A spring rest pad 132 extends out from the inner face 120. The<br>
spring rest pad 132 has a generally planar shape and is oriented such that the<br>
planar surfaces of the spring rest pad 132 are vertical with respect to the lever<br>
body 40. An opening 134 extends through the spring lever 66 from the inner face<br>
120 to the outer face 122 at the base of the spring rest pad 132. The spring rest<br>
pad 132 is configured to engage a portion of the spring mechanism 68.<br>
[0055] As shown in FIG. 6B, the spring lever 66 is symmetrical about<br>
an axis indicated by reference number 136 that is substantially horizontal with<br>
respect to the lever body 40. This symmetry and orientation allows a single<br>
spring lever 66 design to accommodate both sides of the rocker arm assembly<br>
20. Preferably, the spring lever 66 is a stamped steel piece, though it should be<br>
appreciated that various other methods of manufacturing the spring lever 66 may<br>
be employed without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0056] With reference to FIG. 7, the spring member 68 generally<br>
includes a pair of coiled portions 140 connected by an intermediate portion 142<br><br>
that extends between the coiled portions 140. The intermediate portion 142 is<br>
configured to rest on the spring retainer portions 84 of the lever body 40 (FIG.<br>
3A, B). The spring member 68 includes a pair of ends 144 that extend out from a<br>
respective one of the coiled portions 140. The ends 144 engage the spring rest<br>
pads 132 on the spring lever 66 (FIG. 6A, B).<br>
[0057] With combined reference to FIGS. 1-7, the general operation of<br>
the rocker arm assembly 20 will now be described. As can best be seen in FIG.<br>
1, the roller assemblies 42, 44, and 46 are positioned such that they are<br>
engageable by the camshaft 22. More specifically, the first roller assembly 42 is<br>
selectively actuated by the first high-lift cam 28 of the camshaft 22, the second<br>
roller assembly 44 is selectively actuated by the second high-lift cam 30, and the<br>
third roller assembly 46 is selectively actuated by the low-lift cam 32.<br>
[0058] During the first high-lift mode of operation, the latch pin 56 is<br>
extended and therefore the coupling lever 64 is locked from rotation about its<br>
pivot point (the opening 106). The coupling lever 64 in turn locks the center shaft<br>
48 from moving within the opening 53 of the center bearing 54. The high-lift<br>
cams 28 and 30 engage and push downward the first and second roller<br>
assemblies 42 and 44 which are locked from rotation relative to the lever body<br>
40. Accordingly, the lever body 40 actuates to open the valve 18 to a first<br>
opened position.<br>
[0059] During the low-lift mode of operation, the latch pin 56 is<br>
retracted and the coupling lever 64 is unlocked and free to rotate about its pivot<br>
point (the opening 106). The center shaft 48 is accordingly free to move within<br><br>
the opening 53 of the center bearing 54. As the high-lift cams 28 and 30 engage<br>
the first and second roller assemblies 42 and 44, the center shaft 48 is free to<br>
move within the center bearing 54, and the center shaft 48, roller assemblies 42<br>
and 44, and spring levers 66 move downward relative to the lever body 40.<br>
Therefore, the force from the high-lift cams 28 and 30 is not transferred into<br>
opening the valve 18. However, the low-lift cam 32 engages the center bearing<br>
54 which is fixed relative to the lever body 40 and accordingly the lever body<br>
actuates the valve to a second opened position that is less than the first opened<br>
position. As the cams 28, 30, 32 move out of engagement with the roller<br>
assemblies 42, 44, 46, the spring mechanism 68 biases the spring lever arms 66<br>
back to a rest position, and the valve 18 is closed.<br>
[0060] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
