				<td>TITLE<br>
A METHOD FOR MAKING CERAMIC PROCUCT FROM WASTE GLASS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to a method for making ceramic products from waste glass; raw batch formulations<br>
for making ceramic products from waste glass; and ceramic products mede<br>
from waste glass. Examples of ceramic products that can be made by the invention are tile<br>
and brick, but other ceramic products can also be made. The invention addresses two current<br>
problems: energy usage by the ceramic industry needs to be reduced; and new recycled-glass<br>
products are needed.<br>
The ceramic industry consumes large amounts of energy, especially during the firing process.<br>
Firing temperatures greater than 1200° C (2200° F) are required to sinter typical ceramic raw<br>
materials into dense products. Modifications of the raw material formulations have led to<br>
reductions in firing temperatures, but the improvements are limited because of the types of<br>
raw materials used. Most traditional ceramic products, such as tile and brick, consist mainly<br>
of clay-based raw materials, which inherently require high firing temperatures. Other ceramic<br>
manufacturing steps, such as the drying processes, are also very energy intensive. Energy<br>
costs are a major portion of the total manufacturing costs, and thus new methods to reduce<br>
the amount of energy required will be a great benefit to the ceramic industry.<br>
New products utilizing recycled waste glass are needed to further promote glass recycling,<br>
because only a limited amount of glass can be remelted to make new containers (currently the<br>
primary use of recycled glass). New products are especially needed that are less sensitive to<br>
contaminants in the glass, and that can be made from green or mixed-color waste glass.<br>
Research has been conducted and products developed using recycled glass as a ceramic raw<br><br>
material. However, processing problems have limited the developments, so that only a<br>
negligible amount of waste glass is currently utilized (excluding remelting to form new glass<br>
products). These problems occur because of inherent chemical and processing<br>
incompatibilities with traditional ceramic raw materials and manufacturing methods. These<br>
incompatibilities have greatly hampered the development of ceramic products from waste<br>
glass.<br>
Waste glass in the invention refers to any industrial or post-consumer glass that is discarded.<br>
Any form of glass, such as containers (bottles, jars, etc.), plate glass, or fiber glass, can be<br>
used. Waste glass can be obtained from recycling companies or glass manufacturers. Most<br>
waste glass consists mainly of silicon, sodium, and calcium oxides (referred to as soda-lime<br>
glass) with other minor components, such as aluminum and magnesium oxides. Soda-lime<br>
glass compositions typically soften from about 650° to about 750° C. This unique softening<br>
behavior causes articles formed from fine powders of soda-lime glass to densify by viscous-<br>
phase sintering at temperatures much lower than usually required to fire ceramic products.<br>
The invention utilizes the low-temperature densification behavior of soda-lime glass to<br>
reduce manufacturing costs by conserving energy and lowering equipment and maintenance<br>
expenses.<br>
Water, clay, and some other common ceramic raw materials are inherently incompatible with<br>
sintering of soda-lime glass powder at low temperatures. This is because chemical species<br>
resulting from reaction of glass with water, or from decomposition of clay, volatilize in the<br>
temperature range where soda-lime glass softens. The volatile species become trapped in the<br>
densifying glass, which causes foaming and porous defects in the final product. Previous<br>
waste-glass based ceramic products have been made with the addition of water and clay. The<br>
porous defects that resulted were minimized by optimizing the processing parameters, but not<br>
eliminated. The following paragraphs describe the previous processing problems that have<br>
occurred when trying to use waste glass as a ceramic raw material.<br>
Brown and Mackenzie [J. of Materials Science, Vol. 17, pp. 2164-2193, 1982] fabricated<br>
ceramic tile from recycled glass combined with clay and water. The fired properties were<br>
found to be greatly affected by the amount of clay and water added, because of variations in<br>
the amount of porosity that occurred. Low [J. of Materials Science, Vol. 15, pp. 1509-1517,<br>
1980] demonstrated that special foaming agents, such as calcium carbonate, were not<br><br>
necessary to foam glass. The volatile species from decomposition of mica, similar to that in<br>
clays, combined with the glass-water reaction was all that was necessary to produce extreme<br>
foaming.<br>
Liu, Li, and Zhang [Glass Technology, Vol. 32, No. 1, pp. 24-27,1991] investigated<br>
processing recycled glass powder with organic binders and water. They reported that the<br>
binder (and water) content had to be kept low to prevent bubbling in the fired samples and<br>
"inferior chemical and physical properties." Even with low water content, the densities of the<br>
fired samples indicate that some degree of foaming occurred. This work demonstrates the<br>
adverse effects that occur from reactions between glass powder and water, even when only<br>
small amounts of water are added without the addition of clay.<br>
Several patents involve the use of recycled glass as a ceramic raw material. Shutt and<br>
Campbell [US Patent 3,963,506] combined ground waste glass with clay, crushed brick, and<br>
water to produce building panels and bricks. The fired material had open porosity, and<br>
problems of warpage and bloating, indicating that adverse glass-water reactions occurred.<br>
Mackenzie [US Patent 3,963,503] patented a method of making glass products from ground<br>
waste glass combined with a treating" agent. The work mainly concentrated on foaming glass,<br>
and is typical of how much of the research on recycled glass ended up focusing on foamed<br>
glass to take advantage of the problems that occurred.<br>
Boyce [US Patent 4,271,109] received a patent for a method of manufacturing ceramic<br>
insulators for electric lamp bases from mixing 25-45% crushed scrap glass with clay and<br>
wollastonite. After firing at 1050° C, densities of 1.9 g/cc resulted, which indicates that at<br>
least 20% porosity still remained. Cihon [US Patent 5,028,569] patented a batch formulation<br>
and method of producing a ceramic article from 60-85% soda-lime glass cullet combined<br>
with clay, flint, and a liquid (water was used in examples). He discussed problems that<br>
occurred because of reaction of glass with water.<br>
Dutton [US Patent 5,244,850] patented a building material composed of 10-50% recycled<br>
glass combined with slate particles. Two processes were described. One involved melting the<br>
recycled glass, mixing in slate particles, and then pressing the molten mixture in a mold. In<br>
the second process, slate particles with or without recycled glass were mixed with an alkali-<br>
metal silicate water solution or suspension, such as sodium silicate (water glass), pressed in a<br><br>
mold, dried, and fired at 920° and 1050° C. Lingart [US Patent 5,536,345] patented a process<br>
for manufacturing natural stone-type, panel-shaped construction and decoration materials<br>
consisting of three layers; a bottom layer of sand, middle layer of a mixture of sand and<br>
crushed glass, and a top layer of crushed glass. The glass was crushed to 2-3 mm in size and<br>
mixed with at least 5% water. The layers were deposited in a mold and fired in the mold to<br>
600-850° C, followed by an elaborate series of holds at different temperatures and careful<br>
cooling.<br>
Golitz et al. [US Patent 5,583,079] patented a ceramic tile product composed of 25-50% glass<br>
mixed with fly ash, clay, and water. This work focused on lowering the cost of the raw<br>
materials by using fly ash. The pressed green tile was glazed and then fired at 970-1025° C.<br>
Greulich [US Patent 5,649,987] patented a process for producing tabular building and<br>
decorative materials similar to natural stone consisting of 85-98% glass mixed with water and<br>
various other components, such as sand and inorganic pigments. The mixture was deposited<br>
in a mold and fired in the mold at 720-1100° C. A closed glossy surface resulted, however<br>
polishing the surface revealed bubbles. Lingart and Tikhonova [US Patents 5,792,524 and<br>
5,895,511] patented processes of producing ceramic tile from mixtures of glass, sand, water,<br>
and sodium silicate (water glass) solution. The materials were pressed in a mold, and then<br>
fired in the mold by a relatively complicated procedure. The authors stated that air bubbles<br>
formed, and were kept from rising to the surface by controlling the temperature gradient,<br>
between the layers during firing.<br>
The present invention eliminates the previous processing problems discuss above. The<br>
invention is novel, because a high-quality ceramic product can be manufactured at low cost<br>
from up to 100% waste glass without requiring the addition of water and clay. The invention<br>
also conserves energy and natural resources compared to traditional ceramic processing<br>
methods. It was unexpected that the addition of water and clay would not be necessary to<br>
manufacture a low-cost ceramic product, such as tile or brick, using waste glass as a raw<br>
material. It was also unexpected that a nonaqueous organic binder system could be used to<br>
process waste glass into ceramic products with me overall manufacturing costs kept low.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The invention provides a method to transform large quantities of waste glass into useful<br>
ceramic products by a low-cost highly-automated manufacturing process. The major steps of<br>
this method consist of dry preparation of glass powder, granulation with a non-aqueous<br>
organic binder system, dry pressing with adequate green strength, and firing at low<br>
temperatures. Up to 100 percent recycled waste glass can be used as the raw material. Water<br>
and clay are not required in the processing, which eliminates problems that were encountered<br>
in the past. An expensive spray drying step, which is traditionally needed to produce<br>
granulated powder for the pressing step, is not required. Molds to fire the ceramic products in<br>
are also not required. Only one firing step is needed with a low peak firing temperature of<br>
about 750° C. The method of the invention conserves energy and natural resources compared<br>
to clay-based traditional ceramic manufacturing.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
High-quality impervious ceramic products can be produced by the invention with low<br>
manufacturing costs. A ceramic microstructure with only a small amount of porosity can also<br>
be achieved. Impervious refers to ceramic products with very low water absorptions of less<br>
than 0.5%. An impervious ceramic microstructure with a small amount of porosity is critical<br>
to achieve high-quality properties. Ceramic products can be produced by the invention with a<br>
wide range of colors with smooth glossy glaze-like surfaces. The surface texture and other<br>
fired properties can also be adjusted by the addition of fillers, and/or by partial crystallization<br>
of the glass.<br>
The raw batch formulations of the invention consist of 70-99% waste glass, 0-20% filler, and<br>
1-10% organic binder. Preferred raw batch formulations consist of 84-99% waste glass, 0-<br>
10% filler, and 1-6% organic binder. All percentages are based on weight. It is also<br>
understood that other common ceramic processing additives, such as wetting agents,<br>
surfactants, deflocculants, coagulants, flocculants, plasticizers, antifoaming agents,<br>
lubricants, preservatives, etc. can be added to the raw batch formulation to further optimize<br>
the processing without changing the scope of the invention.<br>
The organic binder and other organic additives (if included) will burn out during firing, and<br>
thus are not part of the final product. The waste glass and filler are inorganic components that<br><br>
remain after firing;, and make up the final product composition. The initial raw batch<br>
formulation (given above) therefore transforms during firing to the final product composition<br>
consisting of 80-100% waste glass and 0-20% filler. The preferred final product composition<br>
consists of 90-100% waste glass and 0-10% filler. The final product composition is<br>
determined by subtracting the organic binder amount from the raw batch formulation, and<br>
then renormallizing the remaining composition to 100%.<br>
The filler in the invention is a ceramic raw material added to modify the color, surface<br>
texture, or any other property of the final product. The addition of a filler is not necessary to<br>
make a high quality ceramic product, but may be desired to produce a specific set of<br>
properties in the final product. A wide range of filler additives can be used in the invention<br>
individually or in combination. A filleradded to control the color is referred to as a colorant.<br>
A wide range of common ceramic colorants can be used to produce ceramic products by the<br>
invention with any color desired. Examples of individual oxide colorants are cobalt oxide to<br>
produce blue colors, chromium oxide for greens, and iron oxide for reds. Many commercial<br>
colorants are available based on complicated combinations of oxides which are often melted<br>
to form glass frits. In addition to the color, other properties, such as surface texture and<br>
mechanical properties, can be modified by the addition of fillers. Other examples of fillers are<br>
aluminum and zirconium oxides.<br>
The waste glass and fillers must be in powder form to be used in the raw batch formulations.<br>
The powder particle size required depends on the final properties desired. For the invention<br>
the waste glass and filler powders have particle sizes 
is 
formulations to adjust the properties of the final product. For example, coarser fillers can be<br>
added to produce a rougher surface texture to increase the coefficient of friction and slip<br>
resistance.<br>
The organic binder in the invention consists of any organic material that can be added to bond<br>
the inorganic waste glass and filler particles together. The organic binder is initially mixed<br>
with waste glass and filler particles to form a granulated free-flowing powder. This powder<br>
is then formed into the ceramic articles. After the forming step, the organic binder provides<br>
enough strength in the unfired article for handling and transport to the firing step.<br><br>
Examples of organic binders are natural gums, cellulose ethers, polymerized alcohols, acrylic<br>
resins, glycols, and waxes. Polyethylene glycol was used as the organic binder in the<br>
examples of the invention given below. Other organic binders can be used without changing<br>
the scope of the invention. To be effective the organic binder needs to be in liquid form, so<br>
that the inorganic waste glass and filler particles can be wetted and coated by the organic<br>
binder. Organic binders at room temperature (~20° C) are in either liquid or solid states. A<br>
solid organic binder can be dissolved in specific liquids, mixed with the inorganic powders,<br>
and then dried to remove the liquid to produce an inorganic powder coated with the organic<br>
binder. In the invention nonaqueous liquids, such as alcohols, are used to dissolve the solid<br>
organic binders. If the organic binder is in a liquid form, then an additional nonaqueous liquid<br>
is not required.<br>
The following paragraphs describe details of each step of the method of the invention. The<br>
first step of the method consists of dry preparation of glass powder.. Typical container glass<br>
bottles and jars found in municipal solid waste can be used as the starting glass to prepare the<br>
powder, but other forms of waste glass can also be used. Any color or combination of colors<br>
of waste glass can be used. The method of the present invention is not sensitive to normal<br>
levels of contaminants in the waste glass, and thus cleaning of the glass is not required. The<br>
labels on the glass do not need to be removed. The waste glass is ground into powder by two<br>
grinding steps.<br>
The first grinding step consists of crushing the glass to 
equipment commonly used to crush glass, rocks, ceramic raw materials, etc., such as a jaw or<br>
cone crusher can be used. The crushed glass is screened through a 4 mesh sieve to separate<br>
the 5 mm) of glass that do not pass through the sieve<br>
are circulated back into the crusher to further crush the glass until it is less than 5 mm in size.<br>
During the crushing step a dust collector is used to separate the lighter weight label particles<br>
from the glass. The label particles are discarded.<br>
The 
present. Any type of oven can be used. A preferred type is a rotary drier that can be setup in a<br>
continuous process. After drying, the glass is ground in the second grinding step to reduce the<br>
size down to 
of milling equipment can be used for this grinding step, such as a ball mill, hammer mill,<br><br>
vibratory mill, attrition mill, roller mill, etc. After milling, the ground glass is screened<br>
through a 30 mesh sieve (or 100 mesh for the preferred particle size). The particles that do<br>
not pass through the sieve are circulated back into the mill to be milled again. During this<br>
grinding step a dust collector is again used to separate the lighter weight label particles from<br>
the glass.<br>
The fine glass powder (
combined with the desired amounts of fillers and organic binder based on the raw batch<br>
formulation used. The amounts of each component are weighed on a balance, combined, and<br>
then mixed. The organic binder is added in liquid form, either because the starting binder is a<br>
liquid, or because the binder is dissolved in a nonaqueous liquid, such as an alcohol. The<br>
liquid organic binder is combined with the dry glass and filler powders preferably by<br>
spraying the liquid on the powders, but other common methods of combining the raw batch<br>
materials can also be used. The combined materials are mixed in any type of mixer that will<br>
produce a granulated free-flowing powder, such as a pan mixer, conical blender, ribbon<br>
mixer, rotating drum mixer, etc. Excess nonaqueous liquid can be removed by drying in a<br>
drier, such as a fluid bed drier, or by spray drying. However, it is preferred to keep the liquid<br>
content low enough, so that a drying step is not required.<br>
The granulated free-flowing powder of the raw batch formulation is formed into a green<br>
ceramic article. Green here refers to the unfired ceramic. Any type of forming method can be<br>
used, but preferably dry pressing is used. For dry pressing the powder is placed in a metal die<br>
of the desired shape and pressed with rams to compact the powder. The pressed-article is then<br>
removed from the die and fired in a kirn or furnace. If a nonaqueous liquid was added to<br>
dissolve the binder, then an additional drying step in an oven can be included before firing to<br>
remove any remaining liquid. Preferably, this drying step is not required, because additional<br>
liquid was either not included (a liquid binder was used), or was removed during mixing<br>
and/or forming.<br>
The initial stage of the firing process consists of binder burnout to remove the organic binder.<br>
Preferably the binder burnout is conducted during the initial heating of the ceramic articles<br>
for firing. Separate processes of binder burnout and firing can also be used. In either case the<br>
organic binder must be completely removed prior to the softening and sintering of the glass<br>
powder to prevent defects from developing in the fired product. Organic binders typically<br><br>
burnout from about 200-400° C. The specific firing profile of temperature and time will<br>
depend on the raw batch formulation used. Preferably the temperature and time required are<br>
minimized, while still resulting in nearly 0% porosity. The maximum firing temperature<br>
required ranges from about 700° C to about 800° C, and is preferably about 750° C.<br>
The following paragraphs provide 16 examples of the invention. Most of the steps of the<br>
method are the same for each of the examples. The differences are from variations in the raw<br>
batch formulations and organic binder system used.<br>
Example 1: The raw batch formulation of Example 1 consisted of 94% clear glass powder<br>
and 6% organic binder (percentages based on weight). The glass powder was prepared from<br>
clear glass bottles and jars by a two step grinding process. In the first step whole glass<br>
containers were crushed in an in-house designed crushing system which involved crushing<br>
glass in a closed hard plastic chamber. The crushed glass was then sieved through 6 mesh (
mm). In the second step the 
with alumina media, and then sieved through 100 mesh (
combined with an equal amount by weight of isopropyl alcohol (99%) and 6 weight % (of the<br>
glass amount) organic binder polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000 from Union Carbide). The<br>
solution was mixed, dried in an oven at 60° C to remove the alcohol, and sieved through 100<br>
mesh (
pressed at 5,000 psi (pounds per square inch) in a one inch square metal die using a hydraulic<br>
press. The pressed articles were fired in a programmable box furnace to first burnout the<br>
organic binder, and then to sinter into dense ceramic tile. A maximum temperature of 750° C<br>
was held for one hour. The resulting tile samples had water absorptions of 
porosities of 
The samples were glossy white in color with smooth glaze-like surfaces.<br>
Examples 2 and 3: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for<br>
these examples, except that the clear glass containers used in Example 1 were replaced by<br>
green glass bottles in Example 2 and brown glass bottles in Example 3. High quality tile<br>
resulted similar to those of Example 1, except that the Example 2 tile were green colored, and<br>
the Example 3 tile brown colored.<br><br>
Examples 4-9: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for these<br>
examples, except that 5% of the clear glass amount was replaced by a colorant filler. Six<br>
commercially available ceramic colorants were evaluated. Example 4 used a red colorant<br>
(Mason #6031); Example 5 an orange colorant (Mason #6121); Example 6 a green colorant<br>
(Mason #6224); Example 7 a blue colorant (Mason #6306); Example 8 a brown colorant<br>
(Mason #6109); and Example 9 a black colorant (Mason #6600). High quality tile resulted<br>
similar to those of Example 1, except that the colors of the tile corresponded to the colorant<br>
used. These examples demonstrate the ability of producing a wide range of colors by the<br>
invention.<br>
Examples 10-15: The same procedures described above for Examples 2 and 3 were also used<br>
for these examples, except that 1% of the green or brown glass amounts was replaced by a<br>
colorant filler. The same red, green, and blue colorants were used as listed in Examples 4, 6,<br>
and 7. Example 10 combined green glass with red colorant; Example 11 green glass with<br>
green colorant; Example 12 green glass with blue colorant; Example 13 brown glass with red<br>
colorant; Example 14 brown glass with green colorant; and Example 15 brown glass with<br>
blue colorant. High quality tile resulted similar to those of the previous examples, except that<br>
additional color variations resulted. These examples further demonstrate the ability of<br>
producing a wide range of colors by the invention.<br>
Example 16: The same procedure described above for Example 1 was also used for this<br>
example, except that the organic binder PEG-8000 was replaced with a different polyethylene<br>
glycol (PEG-300 from Union Carbide). PEG-8000 used in Examples 1-15 was initially in a<br>
solid form, and had to be dissolved in a liquid (isopropyl alcohol was used) to wet and coat<br>
the glass particles. PEG-300 was initially in a liquid form, and so a liquid was not necessary.<br>
Six weight % PEG-300 (based on the glass amount) was combined with the glass powder<br>
without any additional liquid added. The glass and PEG-300 were mixed, and then pressed<br>
without the drying and sieving steps that were previously used after the binder addition. All<br>
other steps of Example 1 were used. High quality tile resulted similar to those of Example 1.<br>
A detailed description of the invention with examples was described above. It is understood<br>
that various other changes and modifications can be made to the present invention by those<br>
skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, a glaze can<br>
also be applied to the ceramic product if desired, but is not necessary. A glaze can be applied<br><br>
before firing, so that only one firing is required. A glaze can also be applied after firing, but<br>
then a second firing is required.<br><br>

binder mixture is comprised of the glass powder, 0.1-20 weight percent of the glass-<br>
filler-binder mixture is comprised of the filler, and 1-10 weight percent of the glass-<br>
filler-binder mixture is comprised of the organic binder.<br>
14.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the filler comprises an inorganic material,<br>
excluding clays and other ceramic raw materials that produce volatile species in a<br>
softening temperature range of the waste glass.<br>
15.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the filler comprises an inorganic colorant.<br><br>
16.	 	A method according to claim 10, wherein the filler comprises coarse-sized particles<br>
added to roughen a surface texture of the ceramic product.<br>
17.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the firing comprises heating the green<br>
ceramic article to a maximum temperature of about 700 C to about 800 C.<br>
18.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the firing causes partial crystallization of<br>
the ceramic product.<br>
19.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the ceramic product comprises tile or<br>
brick.<br>
20.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the ceramic product has a smooth glossy<br>
surface.<br>
21.	The method according to claim 10, wherein the ceramic product is further processed<br>
by applying a glaze thereon.<br><br>
The invention provides a method to transform large quantities<br>
of waste glass into useful ceramic products by a low cost<br>
manufacturing process. The major steps of the method consist<br>
of dry preparation of glass powder, granulation with a<br>
nonaqueous organic binder system, dry pressing with adequate<br>
green strength, and firing at low temperatures. Water and clay<br>
are not required in the processing, which eliminates problems<br>
that were encountered in the past. Only one firing step is<br>
needed with a low peak firing temperature of about 750°C. The<br>
method conserves energy and natural resources compared to<br>
clay-based traditional ceramic manufacturing. High-quality<br>
impervious ceramic products with only a small amount of<br>
porosity can be produced by the invention.</td>
