This invention relates to improvement in device of gas accident arrestor and also introduces the combined method of saving gas. There was a drastic need of this device from the public as there was no such device which was a combination of both gas safety and gas saving. There was a proposal of gas safety device combined with gas saving device, for example the invention related to gas devices have introduced which comprises the valve and acts as a flashback arrestor which were used for gas welding and cutting purposes. This invention was only acting as a flash back arrestor .The present invention acts as an accident arrestor and the way of acting as an accident arrestor is different from what the earlier inventions were and the novelty in this invention is it acts as accident arrestor and gas saver simultaneously. PROPOSED TECHNICAL SOLUTION<br>
An apparatus comprising of a miniature tank made up of two concentric reducers and two nipples with BSP threads fitted on either sides of the apparatus with a ball and non-return valves fitted to the system and nozzles are fitted on either ends of the apparatus, which collects gas in the miniature tank enhancing the performance by way of saving the gas and also arresting accidents by way of backfire or bursting of gas cylinder etc. The object of this present invention is to provide a gas safety device with a miniature gas tank fitted within the apparatus which becomes the primary source of gas supply and cuts off the direct relationship of LPG cylinder (which now will be the secondary source of<br><br>
gas supply) having a plurality of non returnable valve extending to an internal orifice of the "Gas out" end of apparatus adapted for irreversible flow of the gas.<br>
Another object of this present invention is to provide a gas safety device with a Gas Ball Valve of foreign make exclusively used for gases is fitted to the "Gas in" end of the apparatus which helps in shutting off the gas supply completely, whether the cylinders are placed inside or outside the premises. No need to shut off the regulator of the cylinders, since the primary source of supply is cut off when the ball valve is shut off<br>
Another object of this present invention is to provide a gas saving device when the gas, which comes out through the Rotor it collects in the miniature gas tank and as more and more gas is collected inside the gas tank, the gas pressure also proportionately increases, which in effect, throws opens the dynamic balance placed inside the NRV (non returnable valve) releasing/allowing only the calibrated amount of gas for burning, which results in the conservation of gas.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a gas saving device for stoves/burners/geysers and anything and everything that wort; on combustible gas that is effective in raising the combustion performance of the stoves/burners/geysers and provides a substantial improvement in gas economy of conventional stoves/burners/geysers along with automobiles that work on gas.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a gas saving device for stoves/burners/geysers which is simple and easy to manufacture and is connected by the gas rubber tube and mountable between the gas cylinder and the stoves/buraers/geysers etc without modification thereto.<br>
Other object and fuller understanding of this invention may be had by referring to the summary of the invention, the detailed description and Ihe claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This present invention is based of developing an apparatus which operates as a gas safety device and prevents back fire flashing back towards the main source of the gas thereby preventing accidents caused by explosive gases whether in case of domestic, commercial, industrial or automobile.<br><br>
Further this apparatus not only acts as a safety device it also acts as a gas saving device when the gas, which comes out through the Rotor it collects in the miniature gas tank and as more and more gas is collected inside the gas tank, the gas pressure also proportionately increases, which in effect, throws opens the dynamic balance placed inside the NRV (non returnable valve) releasing/allowing only the calibrated amount of gas for burning, which results in the conservation of gas.<br>
In one of the preferred embodiment, where LPG is used, the functioning of the apparatus /product is described in details. The miniature gas tank is unexplodable (tested at 4000 psi) which takes over the drole of LPG cylinder, cutting off its direct relationship with the gas stoves/bumers/geysers/ or any thing that works on LPG, once and for all. When the miniature gas tank becomes the "primary source" of gas supply reducing the main LPG cylinder to the state of "secondary source", in which the quantity of gas is incomparable to the quantity of gas in the miniature tank which contains a very negligible quantity of gas (not more than 150 gms.) the intensity in the case of back fire is minimal and the accidents can very easily be averted (Pressure and Leak-proof Test Certificate is awarded by the internationally reputed "The Indian Institute of Science" (USc.,), Bangalore, India. NRV does not allow the reverse journey of gas, since it has an irreversible mechanism as a "Flame Arrester". NRV plays a vital role in preventing any gas related accidents in the event of leak/back fire from burners and is tested at 300 psi at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Collar Nut connects the 3/8 Ball Valve. Tested Ball Valve is used with 500 psi at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, helps in shutting off the gas supply completely, whether the cylinders are placed inside or outside the premises. The regulator of the cylinder need not be closed, since the primary source of supply is cut off when the ball valve is shut off. The 3/8 Adapter with 3/8 BSP threads is fitted to the gas inlet side of the Ball Valve which connecls the gas inlet nozzle to me Ball Valve and has a Ball Valve Handle to controls the movement of gas. Bush bearings are fabricated out of gunmetal and are housed inside the miniature gas tank as shown in the drawing. These bearings hold the copper rotor dead centre inside the miniature gas tank. The Copper Rotor inside me miniature unexplodable gas tank rotates by the mechanical force created by the gas inflow. The gas mat enters the Rotor escapes through 0.2 mm. dia holes of the<br><br>
Rotor. The gas that comes out through hie Rotor collects itself in the miniature gas tank. As more gas collects inside Ihe gas tank, the gas pressure also proportionately increases, which in effect, opens the dynamic balance placed inside the NRV and allows only the calibrated amount of gas, which results in the conservation of gas. Sealant made of fire proof Teflon material and is positioned at the points where the gas enters in and exits out which ensures that the gas tank remains leak proof. Two nipples made of gun metal with BSP threads are fitted on either ends of the minor dia of the miniature gas tank as shown in the drawing. The nipples hold the Copper Rotor housed inside the miniature gas tank as shown in the Sectional Drawing. Later, nozzles are fitted on either ends of the instrument as shown in the drawing. The nozzles are used to connect the two rubber hoses, one to the "Gas in" to the apparatus and the other to the "Gas out" from the apparatus. All the sub-assemblies/fittings of apparatus /product are secured by Tig Welding &amp;Silver Brazing.<br>
The moment apparatus /product is installed, it cuts off the direct relationship of LPG cylinder with stoves/bumers/geysers and anything and everything that works on LPG. When it is installed, the Gas Guard becomes the primary source of gas supply to the stoves/burners/geysers or where all LPG is used and in the event of any gas leak or back fire, it prevents gas related accidents. This Gas Guard is not only meant for LPG, but can also be used in case of all other explosive gases.<br>
The apparatus /product is fitted between stoves/bumers/geysers/anyrhing that works on LPG and cylinders, and is portable. As a rule, mis apparatus /product should be positioned in front of LPG cylinder (in case of single cylinder) and after the manifold, m case of cylinder banks or where cylinders are more. The apparatus /product is located between the source of gas, i.e., the gas cylinder and the bumer/geyser/stove, in case of domestic. In case of commercial and industrial uses, the apparatus /product is located in the manifold immediately after the gas bank. In case of automobiles, the instrument is fitted between the cylinder and the engine. This apparatus /product can either be wall mounted or can be installed in the gas pipeline which depends on the individual situation and one's convenience.<br><br>
The apparatus /product can be used in case of houses, hotels, hostels, marriage halls, hospitals, factories, jewellery manufacturing units, non-ferrous dye-casting units, all types of automobiles, process industries, where all, gas fired boilers are used and to be more precise, where all explosive gases are used.<br>
