				<td>Active compound combinations having insecticidal properties<br>
The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations comprising firstly at least one known compound of the formula (I) and secondly at least one further active compound from the classes of the benzenedicarboxamides, the macrolides, the diacylhydrazines, the carboxylates or another class, which combinations are highly suitable for controlling animal pests, such as insects and unwanted acarids.<br>
It is already known that compounds of the formula (I)<br>
in which<br><br>
(Formula Removed).<br>
10      R	represents methyl or eyelopropyl<br>
have insecticidal activity (cf. EP-A 0 539 588). Specifically, these are the compounds of the formulae (la) and (lb) <br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
15      Furthermore, it is already known that numerous heterocycies, organotin compounds, benzoylureas and pyrethroids have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf. WO 93-22 297, WO 93-10 083,<br>
-<br>

are synergistically active and suitable for controlling animal pests.<br>
Surprisingly, the insecticidal activity of the active compound combination according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds. An unforeseeable true synergistic effect is present, and not just an addition of activities.<br>
In addition to at least one active compound of the formula (I), the active compound combinations according to the invention comprise at least one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16) listed above.<br>
Preferably, the active compound combinations according to the invention comprise one of the active compounds (la) or (lb) and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16) listed individually above.<br>
Specifically, we found the combinations listed in Table 1, where each combination is per se a preferred embodiment according to the invention.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Mixture comprising [(methylamino)carbonyljphenyl} -1 -(3 -chloropyridin-2-yl)-1 H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide))<br>
The synergistic effect is particularly pronounced when the active compounds in the active compound combinations according to the invention are present in certain weight ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the combinations according to the invention comprise an active compound of the formula (I) and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16) in the following preferred and particularly preferred mixing ratios:<br>
Preferred mixing ratio:	125:1 to 1:125<br>
Particularly preferred mixing ratio:        25:1 to 1:25<br>
The mixing ratios are based on weight ratios. The ratio is to be understood as meaning active compound of the formula (I) : active compound (2-1) to (2-16).<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention, in combination with good plant tolerance and favourable toxicity to warm-blooded animals and being tolerated well by the environment, are suitable for protecting plants and plant organs, for increasing the harvest yields, for improving the quality of the harvested material and for controlling animal pests, in particular insects, arachnids, helminths, nematodes and molluscs, which are encountered in agriculture, in horticulture, in animal husbandry, in forests, in gardens and leisure facilities, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene sector.

If appropriate, the active compound combinations according to the invention can, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides, safeners, growth regulators or agents to improve plant properties, or as microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics, bactericides, viricides (including agents against viroids) or as agents against MLO (Mycoplasma-like organisms) and RLO (Rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compound combinations is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, habitat or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are particularly suitable for treating seed. Here, the combinations according to the invention mentioned above as preferred or particularly preferred may be mentioned as being preferred. Thus, a large part of the damage to crop plants which is caused by pests occurs as early as when the seed is attacked during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, and during and immediately after germination of the<br>
plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable compositions is therefore of particularly great interest.<br>
The control of pests by treating the seeds of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional application of crop protection agents after sowing or after the emergence of the plants. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide maximum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by pests, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic insecticidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and also the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection agents being employed.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates in particular also to a method for protecting seed and germinating plants against attack by pests which comprises treating the seed with an active compound combination according to the invention. The method according to the invention for protecting seed and germinating plants against attack by pests comprises a method wherein the seed is treated simultaneously with an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16). The invention also comprises a method wherein the seed is treated at different times with an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16). The invention also relates to the use of the active compound combinations according to the invention for treating seed for protecting the seed and the plant emerging therefrom against pests. Furthermore, the invention relates to seed treated with an active compound combination according to the invention for protection against pests. The invention also relates to seed treated simultaneously with an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16). The invention furthermore relates to seed treated at different times with an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16). In the case of seed treated at different times with an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16), the individual active compounds of the composition according to the invention, may be present in different layers on the seed. Here, the layers comprising an active compound of the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16) may optionally be separated by an intermediate layer. The invention also relates to seed where an active compound of<br>
the formula I and one of the active compounds (2-1) to (2-16) are applied as component of a coating or as a further layer or further layers in addition to a coating.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the active compound combinations according to the invention mean that treatment of the seed with these active compound combinations not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from pests. In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
A further advantage is the synergistically increased insecticidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention in comparison with the insecticidal individual active compound, which exceeds the expected activity of the two active compounds when applied individually. Also advantageous is the synergistically increased fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention in comparison with the fungicidal individual active compound, which exceeds the expected activity of the active compound when applied individually. This makes possible an optimization of the amount of active compounds employed.<br>
It is likewise to be considered as advantageous that the active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed also in particular in transgenic seed, the plants arising from this seed being capable of expressing a protein directed against pests. By treating such seed with the active compound combinations according to the invention, certain pests can be controlled merely by the expression of the, for example, insecticidal protein, and additionally be protected by the active compound combinations according to the invention against damage.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety as already mentioned above which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of maize, peanut, canola, oilseed rape, poppy, soya beans, cotton, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), rice, sorghum and millet, wheat, barley, oats, rye, sunflower, tobacco, potatoes or vegetables (for example tomatoes, cabbage plants). The active compound combinations according to the invention are likewise suitable for treating the seed of fruit plants and vegetables as already mentioned above. The treatment of the seed of maize, soya beans, cotton, wheat and canola or oilseed rape is of particular importance.<br>
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with an active compound combination according to the invention is also of particular importance. This takes the form of seed of plants which, as a rule, comprise at least one heterologous gene which governs the expression of a polypeptide with  in particular insecticidal properties.  In this context, the<br>
heterologous genes in transgenic seed may be derived from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed which comprises at least one heterologous gene originating from Bacillus sp. and whose gene product shows activity against the European corn borer and/or the corn root worm. It is particularly preferably a heterologous gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the active compound combination according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state which is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the active compound combination according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
The active compound combinations can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, water- and oil-based suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, soluble granules, granules for broadcasting, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural materials impregnated with active compound, synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, fertilizers and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers. The formulations are prepared either in suitable plants or else before or during the application.<br>
Suitable for use as auxiliaries are substances which are suitable for imparting to the composition itself and/or to preparations derived therefrom (for example spray liquors, seed dressings) particular properties such as certain technical properties and/or also particular biological properties. Typical suitable auxiliaries are: extenders, solvents and carriers.<br>
Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes,   alkylnaphthalenes,   chlorobenzenes),   the   alcohols   and   polyois   (which,   if<br><br>
appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide).<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example, ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example, crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as paper, sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example, nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are nonionic and/or ionic substances, for example from the classes of the alcohol-POE and/or -POP ethers, acid and/or POP-POE esters, alkyl aryl and/or POP- POE ethers, fat- and/or POP-POE adducts, POE- and/or POP-polyol derivatives, POE- and/or POP-sorbitan- or -sugar adducts, alkyl or aryl sulphates, alkyl- or arylsulphonates and alkyl or aryl phosphates or the corresponding PO-ether adducts. Furthermore, suitable oligo- or polymers, for example those derived from vinylic monomers, from acrylic acid, from EO and/or PO alone or in combination with, for example, (poly)alcohols or (poly)amines. It is also possible to employ lignin and its sulphonic acid derivatives, unmodified and modified celluloses, aromatic and/or aliphatic sulphonic acids and their adducts with formaldehyde.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the<br><br>
formulations.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
Other possible additives are perfumes, mineral or vegetable, optionally modified oils, waxes and nutrients (including trace nutrients), such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
Stabilizers, such as low-temperature stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability may also be present.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.01 and 98% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention, in commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, can be present in a mixture with other active compounds such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxylic esters, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas, substances produced by microorganisms, and the like.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, or with fertilizers and growth regulators is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compound combinations according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.00000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight.<br>
Application is in a manner appropriate for the use forms.<br><br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, by virtue of the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, tomatoes, peas and other vegetable varieties, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants<br><br>
(with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by virtue of toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (referred to hereinbelow as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazohnones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound combinations according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compound combinations also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the active compound combinations specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

animals, such as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death and reduction in productivity (for meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use of the active compound combinations according to the invention.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are used in the veterinary sector and in animal husbandry in a known manner by enteral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules, pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like), implants, by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing, spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded articles containing the active compounds, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters, marking devices and the like.<br>

The good insecticidal and acaricidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is illustrated by the examples below. Whereas the individual active compounds show weaknesses in their activity, the combinations show an activity which exceeds a simple addition of activities.<br>
A synergistic effect in insecticides and acaricides is always present when the activity of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the active compounds when applied individually.<br>
The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated according to S.R. Colby, Weeds 15 (1967), 20-22 as follows:<br>
If<br>
X	is the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when active compound A is applied<br>
at an application rate of m g/ha or at a concentration of m ppm,<br>
Y	is the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when active compound B is applied<br>
at an application rate of n g/ha or at a concentration of n ppm and<br>
E	is the kill rate, expressed in % of the untreated control, when active compounds A and B is<br>
applied at application rates of m and n g/ha or at a concentration of m and n ppm,<br>
then<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
If the actual kill rate is greater than calculated, the kill of the combination is superadditive, i.e. there is a synergistic effect. In this case, the actual observed kill rate has to be greater than the<br>
value for the expected kill rate (E) calculated from the formula given above.<br>
Example A<br>
Aphis gossypii test<br>
Solvent:	7  parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
Emulsifier:	2  parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration.<br>
Cotton leaves (Gossypium hirsutum) which are heavily infested by the cotton aphid {Aphis gossypii) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration.<br>
After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all aphids have been killed; 0% means that none of the aphids have been killed. The kill rates determined are entered into the Colby formula (see sheet 1).<br>
In this test, for example, the following active compound combinations in accordance with the present application show a synergistically enhanced activity compared to the active compounds applied individually:<br><br>
