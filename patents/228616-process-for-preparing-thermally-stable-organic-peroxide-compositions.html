HEAT STABILIZER FOR ORGANIC PEROXIDES<br>
The present invention relates to a heat stabilizer for organic peroxides. Another subject matter of the invention is a composition comprising organic peroxides which is stable on storage and stable toward heat.<br>
The use of a solvent, miscible with a (lower) alkyl ketone peroxide and exhibiting a boiling point of between approximately 185 and 225°C, for thermally stabilizing organic peroxide has been disclosed in the document FR 1 594 180. This document teaches that the solvent is chosen from esters, aldehydes, ketones, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons and epoxides. It also teaches that, in addition to the heat-desensitizing solvent, pyrrolidine stabilizers can be used to render the ketone peroxides stable on storage.<br>
French Application FR 2 792 321 discloses a process for the manufacture of a controlled-rheology resin from a homopropylene or propylene copolymer in which, in place of the peroxides of the state of the art or in addition to the latter, stable free radicals, such as nitroxides, are incorporated in the resin to be modified, introduced, for example, into the molten zone of an extruder.<br>
Nitroxyl radicals are highly stable radical entities having an N-O' functional group. Reference may be made to the publication by D. Griller and K. Ingold<br><br>
in Accounts of Chemical Research, 1976, 9, 13-19, or to that by A. Forrester et al. "Organic Chemistry of Stable Free Radicals" in Academic Press, 1968, for the definition.<br>
These radicals have the property of reacting very rapidly with carbonaceous radicals resulting from the decomposition of initiators or resulting from radical processes, such as radical polymerizations. This reactivity has been taken advantage of by incorporating these nitroxyl radicals in radical polymerization processes, such as the polymerization of styrene or acrylates, or processes for the copolymerization, decomposition or modification of polypropylene,<br>
The Applicant Company has just found that nitroxyl radicals can thermally stabilize peroxides and make it possible optionally to increase the stability of the latter on storage.<br>
A first subject matter of the present invention is a heat stabilizer for organic peroxides, characterized in that it includes at least one nitroxyl radical in its molecule. Preferably, the heat stabilizer for organic peroxides is an N-heterocyclic compound with the nitrogen atom of the nitroxyl radical forming part of the ring.<br>
Mention may in particular be made, as heat stabilizer, of the compounds represented by the formulae (I), (II) and (III):<br><br><br>
in which R1, R2, R3 and R4, which can be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, a saturated or unsaturated and linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbonaceous group, such as an alkyl or phenyl radical, a polymer chain, which can, for example, be a chain of poly(alkyl (meth)acrylate), such as poly(methyl methacrylate), of polydiene, of polyolefin or of polystyrene, or a functional group, such as a cyano group -CN, an ester group -COOR, an amide group -C0N(R)2/ an alkoxyl group -OR or a phosphonate group -P0(0R)2 in which R represents a hydrocarbonaceous chain having from 1 to 9 carbon atoms, and in which R5, Re, R7 and R8, which can be identical or different, can be chosen from the same family of group as that which has just been envisaged for R1, R2, R3 and R4 and, furthermore, can represent a hydroxyl group -OH or an acid group, such as -COOH or -P0{0H)2 or -SO3H.

The beneficial effect of the stabilizers (TEMPO, AF845 and CXA 5415) on the decomposition temperature of the various organic peroxides is illustrated in table I.<br><br><br>
Products used for the decomposition<br>
Polypropylene with an MFI of 3.3 (23 0^C/2.16 kg) Organic peroxide: 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butyl-peroxy)hexane - Luperox 101 (peroxide content 95%) Stabilizer: TEMPO<br>
Experimental procedure<br>
The polypropylene is decomposed in a corotating twin-screw extruder of Brabender type. This extruder comprises 4 zones Zl to Z4, the respective temperatures of which are 200°C/220°C/220^C/180°C. The extrusion rate at the outlet of zone Z4 depends on the screw speed; it typically varies from 4.5 to 5 kg/h. The lace is granulated after cooling. The product is characterized by the MFI value (measured at 230^C, 2.16 kg), by the value of the modulus (measured according to ISO Standard 17 8) and by the value of the<br><br>
Charpy impact test (measured at 23°C according to ISO Standard 179/leA),<br>
The polypropylene is reduced to the form of a powder, on which a solution based on acetone, on organic peroxide and on TEMPO is adsorbed. After adsorption, the acetone is evaporated and the polypropylene-based reactive mixture is introduced via a hopper into zone 1 (Zl).<br>
The results obtained with regard to decomposition of the problem with a stabilizing composition according to the invention are summarized in table II (examples 3 and 4 carried out from organic peroxide and TEMPO compositions, whereas example 5 was carried out by dispersing the peroxide and the TEMPO separately over the polypropylene powder).<br>
