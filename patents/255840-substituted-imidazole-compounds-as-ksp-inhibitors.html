SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZOLE COMPOUNDS AS KSP INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Grass Reference to Related Applications<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of<br>
United States Provisional Application Serial Number 60/706,901, filed August 9, 2005,<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates substituted imidazole compounds and<br>
pharrnaceutically acceptable salts, esters or prodrugs thereof, compositions of these<br>
compounds together with pharrnaceutically acceptable carriers, and uses of these compounds.<br>
State of the Art<br>
[0003] Kinesihs are motor proteins that use adenosine triphosphate to bind to<br>
microtubules andgenerate mechanical force. Kinesins are characterized by a motor domain<br>
haylng about 350 amino acid residues. The crystal structures of several kinesin motor<br>
domains have been resolved.<br>
[0004] Currently,about one hundred kinesin-related proteins (KRP) have<br>
been identified. Kinesins are involved in a variety of cell biological processes including transport of organelles and vesicles, and maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum. Several<br>
KRPs interact with the microtubules of the mitotic spindle or with the chromosomes directly<br>
and appear to play a pivotal role during the mitotic stages of the cell cycle. These mitotic<br>
KRPs are of particular interest for the development of cancer therapeutics.<br>
[0005] Kinesin spindle protein.(KSP) (also known as Eg5, HsEg5, KNSL1,<br>
or K1F11) is one of several kinesin-like motor proteins that are localized to the mitotic<br>
spindle and known to be required for formation and/or function of the bipolar mitotic	spindle..<br>
[0006] In 1995, the depletion of KSP using an antibody directed against the<br>
C-terminus of KSP was shown to arrest HeLa cells in mitosis with monoastral microtubule<br>
arrays (Slangy et-al., Cell 83:1159-1169,; 1995). Mutations in bimC and cut7 genes, which<br>
are considered to be homologues of KSP, cause failure in centrosome separation in<br><br><br>
Aspergillus nidulans(Enos, A.P., andN.R. Morris, Cell 60:1019-1027, 1990) and<br>
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Hagan, I., and M; Yanagida, Nature 347:563-566, 1990).<br>
Treatment of cells with either ATRA (all trans-retinoic acid), which reduces KSP expression<br>
on the protein level, or depletion of KSP using antisense oligonucleotides revealed a<br>
significant growth inhibition in DAN-G pancreatic carcinoma cells indicating that KSP might<br>
be involved in the antiproliferative action of all trans-retinoic acid (Kaiser, A., et al., J. Biol.<br>
Chem., 2.74,. 1,8925-18931, 1999). Interestingly, the Xenopus laevis Aurora-related protein<br>
kinase pEg2 was shown to associate and phosphorylate XlEg5 (Giet, R., et al., J. Biol. Chem.<br>
274:15005-15013, 1999). Potential substrates of Aurora-related kinases are of particular<br>
interest for cancer drug development. For example, Aurora 1 and 2 kinases are overexpressed on the protein and RNA level and the genes are amplified in colon cancer<br>
patients.<br>
[0007] The first cell permeable small molecule inhibitor for KSP,<br>
"monastrol," was shown to arrest cells with monopolar spindles without affecting<br>
microtubule polymerization as do conventional chemotherapeutics such as taxanes and vinca<br>
alkaloids (Mayer, T.U., et al, Science 286:971-91'4, 1999). Monastrol was identified as an<br>
inhibitor in phenotype-based screens and it was suggested that this compound may serve as a<br>
lead for the development of anticancer drugs. The inhibition was determined not to be<br>
competitive in respect to adenosine triphosphate and to be rapidly reversible (DeBonis, S.,<br>
et al., Biochemistry, 42:338-349, 2003; Kapoor, T.M., et al., J. Cell Biol., 150:975-988,<br>
2000).<br>
[0008] In light of the importance of improved chemotherapeutics, there is a<br>
need for KSP inhibitors that are effective in vivo inhibitors of KSP and KSP-related proteins.<br>

compounds of the invention comprise asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. Such<br>
asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can result in the compounds of the invention<br>
comprising mixtures of stereoisomers at a particular asymmetrically substituted carbon atom<br>
or a.single stereoisomer. As a result, racemic mixtures, mixtures of diastereomers, single<br>
enantiomer, as well as single diastereomers of the compounds of the invention are included in<br>
the present invention. The terms "S" and "R" configuration, as used herein, are as defined by<br>

individual geometrical isomers and stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
C. Compound Preparation<br>
(0088] The compounds ofthis invention can be prepared from readily<br>
available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. Unless<br>
otherwise indicated, the starting materials are commercially available and well known in the<br>
art It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction<br>
temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures) are given, other process<br>
jjpnij.ijjiqns can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary<br>
with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one<br>
skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
[0089] Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art,<br>
conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain-functional.groups from<br>
undergoing undesired reactions. Suitable protecting groups for various functional groups as<br>
well as suitable conditions for protecting and deprotecting particular functional groups are<br>
well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups are described in<br>
"T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition,<br>
Wiley,J^ew York, 1991, and references cited therein.<br>
[0090] Furthermore, the compounds of this invention may contain one or<br>
more chiral centers. Accordingly, if desired, such compounds can be prepared or isolated as<br>
pure stereoisomers, i.e., as individual enantiomers or diastereomers, or as stereoisomer-<br>
enriched mixtures. All such stereoisomers (and enriched mixtures) are included within the<br>
s'cope ofthis invention, unless otherwise indicated. Pure stereoisomers (or enriched<br>
mixtures) may be prepared using, for example, optically active starting materials or<br>
stereoselective reagents well-known in the art. Alternatively, racemic mixtures of such<br>
compounds can be separated using, for example, chiral column chromatography, chiral<br>
resolving agents, and the like.<br><br><br>
[0091] Compounds inihe present invention may be better understood by the'<br>
following synthetic Scheme that illustrate methods for the synthesis of compounds of the<br>
invention. Unless otherwise indicated, the reagents used in the following examples are<br>
commercially available and may be purchased from vendors such as Sigma-Aldrich<br>
Company,-tnc: {Milwaukee" WI&gt;; IIS A).<br>
[0092] As discussed above, compounds of the invention have the following<br>
structure:<br><br>
where R'^.R^.R^R7, andR8 are as defined herein and R5' is-CH2-R5<br>
(providaTthat R5 is not hydrogen) where R5 is as defineqLherein.<br><br>
PG refers to a suitable nitrogen protecting group suclrSs BOC.<br>
[0093] Specifically, in Step A, an appropriately protected (PG) amino acid<br>
la, is dissolved in a suitable amount of an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol. It<br>
should be noted that amino.acid.la^is typically commercially available as are <x></x>
disubstituted amino acids (PG-NH-C(R')(R2)-COOH). To that is added a stoichiometric<br>
amount of a monovalent cation, such as cesium carbonate (CS2CO3) or potassium carbonate<br>
(K2CO3), to form the carboxylate salt (not shown). Upon substantial completion of the<br>
reaction, typically about 15 minutes to about 2 hours, excess solvent is removed by<br>
evaporation under reduced pressure. The residual cesium or potassium salt is then re-<br><br>
dissolved in a suitable solvent, such asDMF and then treated with one-to four equivalents of<br>
the appropriate o-halo-ketone lb (1 eq.), e.g., 2-bromoacetophenone and stirred at RT until<br>
the reaction is substantially complete.<br>
[0094] The product lc is then recovered by conventional methods such as<br>
extraction, filtration, evaporation, and the like. It is generally pure enough to use directly in<br>
the next step.<br><br>
[0095] To a stirred solution of keto-ester lc from step A in a suitable<br>
amount of inert solvent, such as xylenes, is added an excess of aminonium acetate, typically<br>
from about 2 to about.-20 equivalents and preferably about 5 equivalents. In one embodiment,<br>
a Dean-Stajjk trap is added and the reaction mixture is heated to about 120 °C.to,about 160 °C<br>
uritjjfthe-*eactiori is substantially complete. In another embodiment, the reactants are refluxed<br>
in toluene. Once the reaction is substantially complete, the mixture is allowed to cool to RT.<br>
The product', imidazole Id', i3"then recovered by conventional methods such as extraction,<br>
filtration, evaporation, and the like. It is generally pure enough to use directly in the next<br>
step.	•«»s&amp;2*-<br><br>
[0096] The imidazole Id is then reacted with an appropriate aryl or<br>
hete'roafyl-substituted alkyl halide, such as benzyl bromide. Typically, this can be<br>
accomplished by stirring the imidazole Id with an excess of potassium carbonate and DMF<br><br>
and then adding at least an equimolar amount&gt;of the aryl or heteroaryl-substftuted alkyl<br>
halide. Once the reaction is substantially complete, the N-aLkyl imidazole le is recovered by<br>
conventional methods such as extraction, filtration, evaporation, recrystallization, and the<br>
like.<br>
[0091], Compounds of.the. invention when R8 is L-A1 and L is -S(O)q- may<br>
be synthesized using a suitable sulfonyl chloride. Descriptions of various sulfonyl chlorides<br>
may be found, for example, U.S. Patent 6,489,300, which is hereby incorporated by<br>

appropriate aldehyde lg to yleld substituted amine lh which is then recovered and optionally<br>
purified by conventional methods such as extraction, filtration, evaporation, chromatography,<br>
and the like.<br><br>
[0101] In embodiments where R5 is hydrogen, Steps D and E may be<br>
skipped. In these embodiments, imidazole le is used in Step F to make the suitable<br>
carbamate.<br>
I<br><br>
[0102] The substituted amine lh from step E is then put into a solution with<br>
asuitable solvent such as methylene chloride and an excess of a suitable base, such as<br>
triethylamine. Then a suitabljejjarbamate-forrning agent, such as triphqsgene asishov/rci's -—<br>
- added to form carbamate li. Once the reaction is complete, the carbamate li is recovered by-<br>
conventional methods such as extraction, filtration, evaporation, and the like. The carbamate<br>
li is Used directly in the next step or may be optionally purified by conventional techniques.<br><br>
[0103] Carbamate li from step-Fis then combined with a slight excess of the<br>
appropriate amine lp to form the urea lj. Once the reaction is complete, the product lj is<br>
recovered by conventional methods such as extraction, filtration, evaporation, and the like.<br>
[0104] It will be well within me skill of me art to further modify the above<br>
preparation to synthesize other compounds of the invention. For example, reaction of<br><br><br>
suitableisocyanate with amine lh provides for urea compounds as illustrated, e.g., in •'<br>
Example 3.<br>
D. Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
[0105] When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the subject<br>
invention are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These<br>
compositions can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, parenteral,<br>
transdermal, topical, rectal, and intranasal. These compounds are effective, for example, as<br>
both injectable and oral compositions. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well<br>
known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.<br>
[0106] This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the subject invention<br>
above associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of<br>
this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an<br>
excipient or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet,<br>
paper or other container. The excipient employed is typically an excipient suitable for<br>
administration to human subjects or other mammals. When the excipient serves as a diluent,<br>
it can be a solid, seini-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for<br>
the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders,<br>
lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a<br>
solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the<br>
active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions,<br>
and sterile packaged powders.<br>
[0107] In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active<br>
compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other<br>
ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a<br>
particle size of less, than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the<br>
particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in<br>
the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh. •<br>
[0108] Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose,<br>
sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth,<br>
gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile<br><br><br>
water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating<br>
agents such as talc, magnesium stearafe, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifylng -and<br>
suspending agents;, preserving agents suchas methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates;<br>
sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be<br>
formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after<br>
administration to the patient by employlng procedures known in the art.<br>
[0109] , The quantity of active component, that is the compound according to<br>
the subject invention, in the pharmaceutical composition and unit dosage form thereof may be<br>
varied or adjusted widely depending upon the particular application, the potency of the<br>
particular compound and the desired concentration.<br>
(0110) The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form,<br>
each dosage containing from about 1 to about 500 mg, usually about 5 to about 100 mg,<br>
occasionally about 10 to about 30.mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms<br>
refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other<br>
mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to<br>
produce.the desiredjherapeutteeffect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical<br>
excipient. Preferably, the compound of the subject invention above is employed at no more<br>
than about 20 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition, more preferably no more<br>
than about 15 weight percent, with the balance being phaimaceutically inert carrier(s).<br>
[0111] The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is<br>
generally administered in a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount. It will be<br>
understood, however, that the amount of the compound acrually.administered will be<br>
determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition<br>
to be treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the chosen route of administration,<br>
the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the<br>
severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
[0112] In therapeutic use for treating, or combating, cancer in mammals, the<br>
compounds or pharmaceutical compositions thereof will be administered by any appropriate<br>
route, such as orally, topically, transdermally, and/or parenterally at a dosage to obtain and<br>
maintain a concentration, that is, an amount, or blood-level of active component in the<br>
mammal undergoing treatment that will be therapeutically effective. Generally, such<br>
therapeutically effective amount of dosage of active component (i.e., an effective dosage)<br><br><br>
will be in the range of about 0.1 to about 100, more preferably about 1.0 to about 50 mg/lcg of<br>
body weight/day.<br>
[0113] For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active<br>
ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention.<br>
When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the<br>
active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may<br>
be readily subdivided-into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and<br>
capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type<br>
described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about-500 mg of the active ingredientof<br>
the present invention.<br>
[0114] The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or<br>
otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage<br>
component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components<br>
can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and<br>
permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A<br>
variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a<br>
number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac,<br>
cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.<br>
[0115] The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present<br>
invention maybe incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous<br>
solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with<br>
edible oils such as com oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as<br>
elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
.[0116] Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and<br>
suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof,<br>
and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by<br>
the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized<br>
solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be<br><br><br>
attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution,<br>
suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from<br>
devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.<br>

[0137] Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the<br>
present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches")- Such transdermal<br>
patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the<br>
present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for<br>
the delivery, of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be<br>
constructed for continuous, pulsatile.'or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
[0138] Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the<br>
pharmaceutical composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques<br><br>
usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to<br>
bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport<br>
of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,011,472 which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
[0139] Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve<br>
formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of<br>
•hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through<br>
blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to<br>
render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain<br>
barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial<br>
infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.<br>

found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia,<br>
PA, 17th ed. (1985).<br>
E.- Dosage and Administration<br>
[0141] As noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable for use<br>
in a variety of drug delivery systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the<br>
in vivo serum half-life of the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated,<br>
introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional<br>
techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds.<br>
A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et<br>
al.i U.S. Patent Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
[0142] Comppunds of the instant invention are useful for inhibiting or<br>
treating a disorder mediated, at least in part, by the activity of KSP. In one aspect, the<br>
disorder that is mediated, at least in part by KSP, is a cellular proliferative disorder. The term<br>
"cellular proliferative disorder" or "cell proliferative disorder" refers to diseases including,<br>
for example, cancer, tumor, hyperplasia, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorder<br>
and inflammation. The present invention provides methods of treating a human or<br>
mammalian subject in need of such treatment, comprising administering to the subject a<br><br><br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula lor II, dither alone or in<br>
combination with other anticancer agents.<br>
[0143] The compounds of the invention are useful in vitro or in vivo in<br>
inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. The term "cancer" refers to cancer diseases including,<br>
for example, lung and bronchus; prostate; breast; pancreas; colon and rectum; thyroid;<br>
stomach; liver and intrahepatic bile duct; kidney and renal pelvis; urinary bladder; uterine<br>
corpus; uterine cervix; ovary; multiple myeloma; esophagus; acute myelogenous leukemia;<br>
chronic myelognous leukemia; lymphocytic leukemia; myeloid leukemia; brain; oral cavity<br>
and pharynx; larynx; small intestine; non-hodgkin lymphoma; melanoma; and villous colon<br>
adenoma.<br>
[0144] Cancer also includes tumors or neoplasms selected from the group<br>
consisting of carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, sarcomas, and hematological malignancies.<br>
[0145] Additionally, the type of cancer can be selected from the group<br>
consisting of growth of solid tumors/malignancies, myxoid and round cell carcinoma, locally_<br>
advanced tumors, human soft tissue carcinoma, cancer metastases, squamous cell carcinoma,<br>
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, oral carcinoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's<br>
lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cancer of the adrenal cortex, ACTH-producing<br>
'tumor's, nonsmall cell cancers, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers, urological cancers,<br>
malignancies of the female genital tract, malignancies of the male genital tract, kidney<br>
cancer, brain cancer, bone cancers, skin cancers, thyroid cancer, retinoblastoma,<br>
neuroblastoma, peritoneal effusion, malignant pleural effusion, mesothelioma, Wilms's<br>
tumors, gall bladder cancer, trophoblastic neoplasms, hemangiopericytoma', and Kaposi's<br>
sarcoma.<br>
[0146] A compound or composition of this invention may be administered to<br>
a mammal by a suitable route, such as orally, intravenously, parenterally, transdermally,<br>
topically, rcctally, or intranasally.<br>
[0147] Mammals include, for example, humans and other primates, pet or<br>
companion animals, such as dogs and cats, laboratory animals, such as rats, mice and rabbits,<br>
and farm animals, such as horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle.<br>
[0148] Tumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the<br>
multiplication of the cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign,<br>
but others are termed "malignant" and can lead to death of the organism. Malignant<br><br><br>
neoplasms or "cancers" are distihpished from benign growths in that, in addition to<br>
exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they can invade surrounding tissues and<br>
metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater<br>
loss of differentiation (greater "dedifferentiation") and organization relative to one another<br>
and to surrounding tissues. This property is called "anaplasia."<br>
[0149] Compounds having the desired biological activity may be modified<br>
as necessary to provide desired properties such as improved pharmacological properties (e.g.,<br>
in vivo stability, bio-availability), or the ability to be detected in diagnostic applications.<br>
Stability can be assayed in a variety of ways such as by measuring the half-life of the<br>
compounds during incubation with peptidases or human plasma or serum.<br>
[0150] For diagnostic purposes, a wide variety of labels may be linked to the<br>
compounds, which-may provide, directry or indirectly, a detectable signal. Thus, the<br>
compounds and/or compositions of the subject invention may be modified in a variety of<br>
ways for a variety of end purposes while still retaining biological activity. In addition,<br>
various reactive sites may be introduced for linking to.particles, solid substrates,<br>
macrtimo]ecures, "and the like.<br>
[0151] . Labeled compounds can be used in a variety of in vivo or in vitro<br>
applications. "A wide variety of labels may be employed, such as radionuclides (e.g., gamma-<br>
emitting radioisotopes such as technetium-99 or indium-111), fluorescers (e.g., fluorescein),<br>
enzymes, enzyme-substrates, enzyme cofactors, enzyme inhibitors, chemiluminescent<br>
compounds, bioluminescent compounds, and the like. Those of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
know of other suitable labels for binding to the complexes, or will be able to ascertain such<br>
using routine" experimentation. The binding of these labels is achieved using standard<br>
techniques common to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0152] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for use in a<br>
variety of drug delivery systems. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are<br>
found in Remington's.Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Company, Philadelphia,<br>
Pa.„17thed..(1985).<br>
[0153] The amount administered to the patient will vary depending upon<br>
what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy,<br>
the; state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic<br>
applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an<br><br><br>
amount suTficieht to cure or at least partially arrest the progression or symptoms of the<br>
disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as<br>
"therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the disease<br>
condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon<br>
factors such as the severity of the disease, disorder or condition, the age, weight and general<br>
condition of the patient, and the like. .<br>
[0154J The compounds administered to a patient are typically in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be sterilized by<br>
. conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous<br>
solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being<br>
combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound<br>
preparations typically will be between about 3 and 11, more preferably from about 5 to 9 and<br>
most preferably from about 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing<br>
excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.<br>
J0155] The therapeutic dosage of the compounds and/or compositions of the<br>
present invention will vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the<br>
treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the" health and condition of<br>
the patient, and tRe judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, for oral<br>
administration, the dose will typically be in the range of about 5 ug to about 50 mg per<br>
kilogram body weight per day,.preferably about 1 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram body<br>
weight per day. In the alternative, for intravenous administration, the dose will typically be<br>
in the range of about 5 ug to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight, preferably about 500 ug<br>
to about 5000 ug per kilogram body weight. Alternative routes of administration<br>
contemplated include, but are not limited to, intranasal, transdermal, inhaled, subcutaneous<br>
and intramuscular. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived<br>
from in vitro or animal model test systems.<br>
[0156] In general, the compounds and/or compositions of the subject<br>
invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted<br>
modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. Toxicity and therapeutic<br>
efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell<br>
cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD^ (the dose lethal to 50% of the<br>
population) and the ED5o (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The<br><br><br>
dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index' and it can be<br>
expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are<br>
preferred.<br>
[0157] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can<br>
be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds<br>
lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with littleor<br>
no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form<br>
employed.and the route of administration utilized. For any compound and/or composition<br>
used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated<br>
initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a<br>
circulating plasma concentration range which includes the IC50 (the concentration of the test<br>
compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of activity) as determined in cell culture.<br>
Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels<br>
in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
[0158] The following synthetic and biological examples are offered to<br>
illustrate this invention and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the scope of this<br>
invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0159] Referring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present<br>
invention were synthesized.using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are<br>
well known in the art.<br>
[0160] The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography<br>
system with a 2690 Separation Module (Milford, MA). The analytical columns were AUtima<br>
C-18 reversed phase, 4.6 x 250 mm from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). A gradient elution was<br>
used, typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100% acetonitrile<br>
over a period of 40 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).<br>
Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at either 220 or 254 nm.<br>
HPLC-solvents were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegan, MI), or Fisher Scientific<br>
(Pittsburgh, PA). In some instances, purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography<br>
(TLC) using glass or plastic backed silica gel plates, such as, for example, Baker-Flex Silica<br><br><br>
Gel 1B2-F flexible sheets. TLC results were readily detected visually under ultraviolet light,<br>
or by employlng well known iodine vapor, and' other various staining techniques.<br>

[0252] This example provides a representative in vitro assay for determining<br>
CSP activity in vitro. Purified microtubules obtained from bovine brain were purchased from<br><br>
Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, Colorado, USA). The motor domain of human KSP (Eg 5,<br>
KNSL1) was cloned, expressed, and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity. Biomol<br>
Green was purchased from Affinity Research Products Ltd. (Matford Court, Exeter, Devon,<br>
.United Kingdom). Microtubules and KSP motor protein (i.e., the KSP motor domain) were<br>
diluted in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH-7.-5), 1 rnM MgCl2,10 mM DTT and 0.25<br>
mg/mL BSA) to a final concentration of 35 /xg/mL microtubules and 45 nM KSP. The<br>
microtubule/KSP mixture was then pre-incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to promote the binding<br>
of KSP to microtubules.<br>
[0253] To each well of the testing plate (384-well plate) containing 1.25 /xL<br>
of inhibitor or test compound in DMSO (or DMSO only in the case of controls) were added<br>
25 /xL of ATP solution (ATP diluted to a concentration of 300 JJM in assay buffer) and 25 /xL<br>
of the above-described microtubule/KSP solution. The plates were incubated at RT for 1<br>
hour. Following incubation, 65 ilL of Biomol Green (a malachite green-based dye that<br>
detects the release of inorganic phosphate) was added to each well. The plates were<br>
incubated for an additional 5-10 minutes then the absorbance at 630 nm was determined<br>
' using a Victor II plate reader. The amount of absorbance at 630 nm corresponded to the<br>
amount of KSP activity in'the samples." The IC50 of each inhibitor or test compound was then<br>
determined based on the decrease in absorbance at 630 nm at each concentration, via<br>
nonlinear regression using either XLFit for Excel or Prism data analysis software by<br>
GraphPad Software Inc.<br>
[0254.] Preferred compounds of the invention have a biological activity as<br>
measured by an IC50 of less than about 1 mM in assay protocols described in Example 13,<br>
with preferred embodiments having biological activity of less than about 25 uM, wjth<br>

Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation in Tumor Cell Lines Treated with KSP Inhibitors<br>
[0255] Cells are. plated in 96-well plates at densities of about 500 cells per<br>
well of a 96-well plate and are allowed to grow for 24 hours. The cells are then treated with<br>
various concentrations of compounds for 72 hours. Then, 100 /xl of CellTitcr Glo is added.<br><br><br>

5,185,450) (seePromega product catalog #G3580, CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell<br>
Proliferation Assay). The cells are then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes. The amount of<br>
luminescence is determined for each well using a Walloc Trilux plate reader, which correlates<br>
with the number of cells per well. The number of viable cells in the wells that receive only<br>
DMSO (0.5%) serve as an indication of 0% inhibition, while wells without cells serve as<br>
100% inhibition of cell growth. The compound concentration'that results in a 50% growth<br>
inhibition (GI50) is determined graphically from sigmoidal dose-response curves of log-<br>
transformed dose values versus cell counts (percent .of control) at 72 hours of continuous<br>
compound exposure,<br>

Clonogenic Softagar Assay Protocol<br>
[0259] Human cancer cells are plated at a density of 3xl05 cells per well in a<br>
6-v/ell plate. The next day, a corhpound of interest at a certain concentration is added to each<br>
well. After 24 and 48 hours of incubation, the cells are harvested, washed and counted. The<br>
following steps are performed using the Multimek 96 robot. Then, 500 viable cells per well<br>
are plated in a 96-well plate that is coated with PolyHema to prevent attachment of the cells<br>
to the bottom of the well. Agarose (3% stock) is melted, diluted in warmed media and added<br>
to the cells to a final concentration of 0.5%. After the soft agar solidified, the plates are<br>
incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. Alamar blue dye is added to cells and plates are incubated for<br>
an additional 6 hours. The optical density change is measured on a Tecan plate reader and is<br>
considered to correlate with the number of colonies formed in soft agar. A cancerous cell is<br>
able to grow on the agar and thus will show an-increase in optical density. A reading of<br>
decreased,optical density means that the cancer cells are being inhibited. It is contemplated<br>
that compounds of this invention will exhibit a decrease in optical density.<br><br>
