				<td>PROCESS FOR THE DIRECT PREPARATION OF PYRROLOr3.4-C1PYRROLES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the direct preparation of pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles (DPPs) of the formula (I), pigment compositions containing them and their use for coloring high molecular weight organic materials, such as plastics (including Engineering PoLymers (EPL)) and paints. The obtained DPPs of the formula I possess a higher colour strength, a higher chroma, a purer shade and a higher opacity versus corresponding commercially available DPPs.<br>
It is known in the pigments art that substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments can be prepared by the reaction of a mole of a disuccinate with two moles of an aromatic nitrile or one mole each of two different aromatic nitriles. U. S. Patent No. 4,579,949 describes reaction of a disuccinate with aromatic nitriles in an organic solvent and in the presence of a strong base at elevated temperature, and subsequently protolyzing the resultant salt. The product of such process, known as crude diketopyrrolopyrrole, generally has a medium to large particle size. It is necessary to further process the larger particle size crude pigments to obtain the desired pigment properties, such as particle size, particle size distribution, particle shape or polymorphic phase.<br>
Particle size manipulation has thus become a significant art in pigment technology. Highly desirable pigments are traditionally produced by subjecting the crude pigments to a variety of pigment finishing methods, also called pigment conditioning steps, the purpose of which is to create pigments of defined particle size with a narrower particle size distribution, preferably in a single homogeneous crystal phase. In the case of diketopyrrolopyrroles opaque forms are commonly obtained by direct ripening of the protolysed pigment in a mixture of water and miscible solvent at elevated temperature, or by crystallisation in organic solvents or organic solvent mixtures. Mechanical treatment like salt kneading in the presence of aprotic solvents is also suitable to obtain opaque DPP pigments.<br>
EP-A-640 602 und EP-A-640 603 describe that certain cyano-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments can be prepared in finely particulate form by carrying out the protonation step in water and/or an alcohol in the presence of an acid in an amount sufficient to keep the pH less than 9, and a temperature of greater than 90Â°C. Inclusion of particle growth regulators during the synthesis of diketopyrrolopyrroles is not mentioned.<br><br>
US-A-5,738,719 describes that when a minor amount of a cyano-substituted diketopyrrolo-pyrrole is added before or during the synthesis of a pyrrolopyrrole which is not substituted by cyano, the crystal growth inhibition is very surprisingly enhanced. Accordingly it is possible to produce, depending on the conditions of protolysis, highly transparent as well as opaque pigment forms of superior colour strength which are particularly resistant to recrystallisation and heat and which are also very suitable for the warp-free pigmenting of polyolefins.<br><br>
or with mixtures of said nitriles, in an organic solvent and in the presence of a strong base and an effective amount of selected particle growth inhibitors, and then obtaining the compound of formula (I) from the reaction product by protolysis.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a process for the direct preparation of opaque pigmentary diketopyrrolopyrroles having a narrower particle size distribution, a higher colour strength, a higher chroma, a purer shade and/or a higher opacity versus corresponding commercially available DPPs.<br><br><br>

The present process provides an improvement in simplicity and economy for the preparation of a variety of opaque diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments. This approach eliminates the need for laborious conditioning processes which are currently practiced in the pigments industry for the manufacture of opaque diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole pigments.<br>
Due to the presence of crystal growth regulors DPP particles exhibiting a higher opacity/hiding power than commercial pigments synthesized without growth controllers are obtained. Normally, a higher opacity is connected with duller aspect, lower chroma, bluer hue (in the case of red DPP pigments) and weaker colour strength. In the present case, the shade is purer, the hue is yellowier, the chroma is considerably stronger and the colour strength is higher than or at least equal to commercial available DPP pigments.<br>
The expressions "direct" or "directly", when used herein to describe a preparatory process for a pigmentary product, means that the specific surface area of the pigmentary product will be within the range which makes it suitable for use as a pigment with specific desired properties.<br>

The disuccinates to be used in the process according to the invention include dialkyl, diaryl or monoalkyl-monoaryl succinates. The dialkyl and diaryl succinates may also be asymmetrical. However, it is preferred to use symmetrical disuccinates, most preferably symmetrical dialkyl succinates, most preferably symmetrical dialkyl succinates. If a diaryl or monoaryl-monoalkyl succinate is employed, aryl denotes preferably phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted by halogen such as chlorine, C1-4 -alkyl such as ethyl, methyl, isopropyl or tert-butyl, or C1-4 -alkoxy such as methoxy or ethoxy. The preferred meaning of aryl is unsubstituted phenyl. If a dialkyl or monoalkyl-monoaryl succinate is employed, then alkyl may be unbranched or branched, preferably branched, and may contain preferably 1 to 18, in particular 1 to 12, more particularly 1 to 8 and more preferably 1 to 5, carbon atoms. Branched alkyl is preferably sec- or tert-alkyl, for example, isopropyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, tert-amyl and cyclohexyl.<br>
Examples of disuccinates are dimethyl succinate, diethyl succinate, dipropyl succinate, dibutyl succinate, dipentyl succinate, dihexyl succinate, diheptyl succinate, dioctyl succinate, diisopropyl succinate, di-sec-butyl succinate, di-tert-butyl succinate, di-tert-amyl succinate, di-[1,1-dimethylbutyl] succinate, dK1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl] succinate, di-[1,1-dimethylpentyl] succinate, di-[1-methyl-ethylbutyl] succinate, di-[1,1-diethylpropyl] succinate, diphenyl succinate, di-[4-methylphenyl] succinate, di-[4-chlorophenyl] succinate, monoethyl-monophenyl succinate, and dicyclohexyl succinate. Most preferably, the starting disuccinate is diisopropyl succinate.<br>
The disuccinates and the nitriles of formula (II) or (III) are known compounds and may be prepared by known methods.<br>
Typically, the nitrile and the disuccinate are used in stoichiometric proportions. It can be advantageous to use the nitrile to be reacted with the disuccinate in more than only stoichiometric proportions. It has been found that the yield of final product may be improved by using an excess of nitrile over disuccinate, in which case the optimum amount must be determined according to the respective reactants and may be up to ten times the stoichiometric amount required with respect to the disuccinate. It is normally possible to recover excess nitrile. An excess of disuccinate over the nitrile can often have a positive<br><br>
influence on the yield, in which case the excess may be up to twice the stoichiometrically required amount of disuccinate.<br>
The reaction of the disuccinate with the nitrile is carried out in an organic solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are primary, secondary or tertiary alcohols containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, for example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, 2-methyl-2-butanol, 2-methyI-2-pentanol, 3-methyl-3-pentanol, 2-methyl-2-hexanol, 3-ethyl-3-pentanol, 2,4,4-trimethyl-2-pentanol, or glycols such as ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol; and also ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxan, or glycol ethers such as ethylene glycol methyl ether, ethylene glycol ethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; as well as dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, benzonitrile, dimethylformamide, N.N-dimethylacetamide, nitrobenzene, N-methylpyrrolidone; aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene or benzene substituted by alkyl, alkoxy or halogen, for example, toluene, xylene, anisole or chlorobenzene; or aromatic heterocyclic compounds such as pyridine, picoline or quinoline. In addition, it is also possible to use the nitrile of formula (II) or (III) simultaneously as solvent if it is liquid in the temperature range in which the reaction takss place. Mixtures of the above solvents may also be used. It is convenient to use 5 to 20 parts be weight of solvent per 1 part by weight of reactants.<br>
In the process according to the invention, it is preferred to use an alcohol as solvent, in particular a secondary or tertiary alcohol. Preferred tertiary alcohols are tert-butanol and tert-amyl alcohol. Mixtures of these preferred solvents with aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or xylene, or halogen-substituted benzene such as chlorobenzene, are also useful.<br>
The process according to the invention is carried out in the presence of a strong base. Suitable strong bases are in particular the alkali metals themselves such as lithium, sodium or potassium, or alkali metal amides such as lithium amide, sodium amide or potassium amide, or alkali metal hydrides such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydride, or alkaline earth metal alcoholates or alkali metal alcoholates which are derived preferably from primary, secondary or tertiary aliphatic alcohols containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, for example, lithium methylate, sodium methylate or potassium methylate, or lithium, sodium or potassium ethylate, lithium, sodium or potassium n-propylate, lithium, sodium or potassium iso-propylate, lithium, sodium or potassium n-butylate, lithium, sodium or potassium sec-butylate, lithium, sodium or potassium tert-butylate, lithium, sodium or potassium 2-methyl-2-butylatet lithium, sodium or potassium 2-methyl-2-pentylate, lithium, sodium or potassium 3-methyl-3-<br><br>
pentylate, lithium, sodium or potassium 3-ethyl-3-penty!ate or lithium, sodium or potassium 3-ethyl-3-pentylate. Additionally, a mixture of these bases may also be employed.<br>
The preferred strong base is an alkali metal alcoholate, the alkali metals being preferably sodium or potassium and the alcoholate being preferably derived from a secondary or tertiary alcohol. Particularly preferred strong bases are therefore, for example, sodium or potassium isopropylate, sodium or potassium sec-butylate, sodium or potassium tert-butylate and sodium or potassium tert-amylate. Moreover, the alkali metal alcoholates may be prepared in situ by reacting the appropriate alcohol with the alkali metal, alkali metal hydride or alkali metal amide.<br>
The strong base is employed in an amount of preferably from about 0.1 to about 10 moles, most preferably from about 1.9 to about 4.0 moles, based on one mole of the disuccinate. Although a stoichiometric amount of base may suffice, an excess of base has been found to have an advantageous effect on the yield.<br>
Regulation in particle size of the 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles of formula (I) relative to the particle size of the unregulated form thereof becomes noticeable with the inclusion of as little as 0.1% of the particle growth regulator relative to the weight of the DPP compound of the formula I. The level of the regulator can be as high as 10% by weight. Although the particle growth regulator can be present in amounts greater than 10%, using more than said amount may adversely affect the color.<br>
A variety of pigments having varying degrees of particle size and transparency require a range of from greater than 0.1%, for example 0.2%, to about 10% of the particle growth regulator. A preferred range of regulator incorporated during the reaction of the nitrile with the disuccinate to produce the pigmentary 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole of formula (I) and/or the conditioning step is the minimum amount necessary to directly prepare a pigmentary 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole up to about 10% by weight of the particle growth regulator, for example from 0.1% up to about 10% by weight. The preferred range of particle growth regulator is from 0.5 to 4% by weight, the most preferred range is from 0.5% to 2% by weight.<br>
The surface area of the 1 ^-diketopyrrolop^-clpyrrole product is directly related to the amount of the particle growth regulator present during the reaction and is inversely proportional to the particle size. Thus, the surface area of the product will increase as the<br><br>
amount of the particle growth regulator increases. In order for the 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrroles of formula (I) to be suitable for direct use as a pigment, the surface area of the reaction product should be at least 15 m2/gram, for example in the range of from about 15 to about 50 m2/gram, preferably from about 20 to 50 m2/gram. The surface area can be measured by nitrogen absorption or another suitable method.<br>
A preferred embodiment is to charge the reaction vessel with the nitrile and the base and then adding the disuccinate in the range of the reaction temperature, which addition order has a particularly advantageous effect on the yield. It is also possible to add the disuccinate and the nitrile simultaneously to the base. The process according to the invention may be carried out not only in a batchwise manner, but also continuously.<br>
In particular, when using disuccinates containing alkyl radicals and alcoholates which are derived from lower alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol or tert-butanol, it may be necessary to remove the lower alcohol formed during the reaction from the reaction medium continuously in order to obtain higher yields.<br>
If an alcohol is used as solvent and an alcoholate as base, it may prove advantageous to choose an alcohol and alcoholate having the same alkyl moieties. It may likewise be advantageous if, in addition, the disuccinate also contains such aikyl groups.<br>
The term "regulating the crystal growth" refers to controlling the synthesis of pigment particles to have a suitable pigmentary size and/or a narrow particle size distribution as well as directing the growth of the crystals to generate particles of a specifically desired shape, such as platelet, needle, cubic, leaflet, prismatic and other geometric forms and/or of a specifically desired rheology. Consequently, the better control of the crystal growth allows gaining samples with a narrower particle size distribution and/or a better crystal shape, or both together. The effect can be influenced by the chemical structure of the organic pigment, the selection of the reaction media and the concentration and chemical structure of the inventive particle growth regulator.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) are used as colorants for high molecular weight organic materials and can be used directly in the form in which they are obtained.<br>
Depending on the end use, it may be advantageous to prepare mixtures of compounds of the formula (I). This can be done for example by mixing different reaction mixtures which have been prepared independently of one another before the protolysis, protolyzing them together and then isolating the resultant mixture of compounds of the formula (I). It is also possible to precipitate two or more compounds of the formula (I) together.<br>
The present invention relates to pigment compositions comprising<br>
a)	a 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole of the formula (I); and<br>
b)	an effective crystal growth directing amount of a compound of formula IVa, IVb and/or IVc or V or VI.<br>
The particle growth regulator is present in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 weight %, based on the weight of the diketopyrrolopyrrole. A more useful range of particle growth regulator is from 0.5% to 4%, in particular 0.5% to 2% by weight of the particle growth regulator.<br>
Organic materials of high molecular weight which may be pigmented with the inventive pigment compositions comprising compounds of formula (I) are for example cellulose ethers<br><br>
and esters such as ethyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate or cellulose butylate, natural resins or synthetic resins such as polymerization resins or condensation resins, for example, aminoplasts, in particular urea/formaldehyde and melamine/formaldehyde resins, alkyd resins, phenolic plastics, polycarbonates, polyolefins such as polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylates polyamides, polyurethanes or polyesters, rubber, casein, silicone and silicone resins, individually or in mixtures.<br>
It is immaterial whether the above organic compounds of high molecular weight are in the form of plastics, melts or of spinning solutions, lacquers, paints or painting inks. Depending on the end use, it is advantageous to use the pigments of this invention in the form of toners or formulations. The high molecular weight organic compounds mentioned can be present individually or in mixtures. The inventive pigment compositions comprising compounds of the formula (I) are employed in an amount of about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10%, by weight, based on the organic material of high molecular weight to be pigmented.<br>
The colorations obtained, for example in plastics, filaments, lacquers or printing inks, have excellent tinctorial strength, good dispersibility, good fastness to overspraying, migration, heat, light and atmospheric influences, as well as good gloss.<br>
The high molecular weight organic substances are pigmented with the inventive pigment compositions comprising pigments of formula (I), for example, by mixing such a pigment, if desired, in the form of a masterbatch, into these substrates using roll mills and mixing or grinding apparatus. The pigmented material is then brought into the desired final form by known methods, such as calendaring, pressing, extruding, brushing, casting or injection molding. It may be desirable to incorporate plasticizers into the high molecular weight compounds before starting operation in order to produce non-rigid moldings or to reduce their brittleness. Suitable plasticizers are, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. Plasticizers can be incorporated before or after the incorporation of pigments according to the invention. To obtain different shades, it is further possible to add fillers or other coloring constituents, such as white, colored, or black pigments, in any desired amounts, to the high molecular weight organic substances, in addition to the pigments according to the invention.<br><br>
The pigments prepared by the present process are particularly suitable for coloring polyvinyl chloride and polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, Engineering PoLymers, like poly(methyl methacrylate), polycarbonate, polystyrene, ABS, PET, polyamide etc., and for pigmenting lacquers and paints in particular for full shade automotive topcoats. When used for this purpose, the pigments prepared in accordance with the present invention possess good general pigment properties such as high dispersability, high saturation and purity and high migration, heat, light and weathering fastness properties.<br>
The following examples are for purposes of illustration, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner whatsoever. Parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>

We obtain a bright red pigment that in comparison to the Comparative Examples exhibits in mass tone a purer, brighter and yellower shade, along with a slightly higher opacity. In white reduction (5:95) the pigment shows considerably higher colour strength than CC-1 and the weather stability (2000h WOM) is comparable to CC-1. The X-ray diffraction spectrum is similar to CC-1, but the broader peak width indicates a lower average particle size. Joyce-Lobl measurements indicate a clearly narrower particle size distribution than CC-1.<br><br><br>
comparison to the Comparative Examples exhibits a considerably yellower shade. The opacity is slightly lower than CC-1. In white reduction (95:5) the colour strength is considerably stronger than CC-1. The X-ray diffraction spectrum is similar to CC-1 ( but the broader peak width indicates a lower average particle size.<br>
Test method<br>
4.0g untreated pigment are added to 46.Og AM-paint prepared as described below. The paint at 8% pigment concentration is dispersed 1hour in Skandex with 200g glass beads (diameter 2mm). The dispersed paint is drawn down (100 jim) on a Mylar sheet and poured out on a glass plate. After 10 minutes the Mylar sheet and the glass plate are allowed to dry 30 minutes at 130Â°C in a hot air oven. The following colour properties of the Mylar sheet are measured using a Datacolor 3890 colorimeter: lightness L*, chroma C*, hue h and opacity (as ATr. over black). The contrast paper is a clean and new standard Leneta. A white reduction containing 5 parts of pigment and 95 parts of white pigment are prepared as follows: 3.27g of the previously prepared mass tone paint are added to 26.73g white AM-paint (description below) and mixed with a simple glass stirrer to yield 30g white reduction, which is drawn down on a Mylar sheet (100 |im). From the Mylar sheet the colour strength is assessed.<br>
