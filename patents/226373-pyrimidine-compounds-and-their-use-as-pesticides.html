The pesticidal composition of the present invention is comprising the ptesent compound as an active ingredient, and an additive. The pesticidal composition bf the present invention may be prepared by mixing the present compound with a solid carrier, a Uquid carrier, a gaseous carrier and/or a bait, and if necessary, adding a surfactant and other adjuvants, and then formulating the mixture into an oil solution, an emulsifiable concentrate, a flowable, a granule, a dust, a poison bait, a microcapsule formulation, or the like. In each of these formulations, the present compound is usually contained in an amount of 0.1% to 95% by weight.<br>
The solid carrier which can be used in the formulation may include, for example, the following materials in iine powder or granular form: clays (e.g., kaolin clay, diatomaceous earth, synthetic hydrated silicon oxide, ben-tonite, Fubasami clay, acid clay); talc, ceramic, and other inorganic minerals {e.g., sericite, quartz, sulfur, activated carbon, calcium carbonate, hydrated silica); and chemical fertilizers {e.g., ammonium sulfate, ammonium phos¬phate, ammonium nitrate, urea, ammonium chloride).<br>
The liquid carrier may include, for example, water: alcohols (e.g.. methanol, ethanol); ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone); aromatic hydrocarbons {e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, methylnaphtha-lene); aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., hexane, cyclohexane, kerosine, hght oil); esters (e.g., ethyl acetate, butyl acetate); nitriles (acetonitrile, isobutyro-nitrile); ethers {e.g., dusopropyl ether, dioxane); acid amides (e.., N,N-di-methylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide); halogenated hydrocarbons {e.g., dichloromethane, trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride); dimethyisulfoxide; and vegetable oils (e.g., soy bean oil and cotton seed oil).<br><br>
The gaseous carrier may include, for example, fluorocarbon, butane gas, hquefied petroleum gas (LPG), dimethyl ether, and carbon dioxide.<br>
The surfactant may include, for example, alkyl sulfate salts; alkyl-<br>
sulfonic acid salts; aikylarylsulfonic acid salts; alkyl aryl ethers and their<br>
poiyoxyethylene derivatives; polyethylene glycol ethers: polyhydric alcohol<br>
esters; and sugar alcohol derivatives.	■        '<br>
The other adjuvants may include binders, dispersants, and stabilizers, specific examples of which are casein, gelatin, polysaccharides {e.g., starch, gum arable, cellulose derivatives, alginic acid), iignin derivatives, bentonite, sugars, synthetic water-soluble polymers {e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylic acid), PAP (isopropyl acid phosphate), BHT (2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol), BHA (mixtures of 2-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol and 3-t-butyl-4-methoxyphenol), vegetable oils, mineral oils, fatty acids, and fatty acid esters.<br>
The base material for poison baits may include, for example, bait ingredients such as grain powders, vegetable oils, sugars, and crystalline cellulose: antioxidants such as dibutylhydroxytoluene and nordihydroguai-aretic acid; preservatives such as dehydroacetic acid; agents for preventing children and pets from erroneously eating, such as hot pepper powder; and pest-attractive flavors such as cheese flavor, onion flavor, and peanut oil.<br>
The method for controlling pests according to the present invention is carried out by applying the pesticidal composition of the present invention to pests or habitats of pests.<br>
When the pesticidal composition of the present invention is used for the control of pests in agriculture and forestry, the application amount is usually 1 to 10,000 g as the amount of the present compound per 1,000 m". Formulations such as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, flowables, and microcapsule formulations are usually used after dilution with water to<br><br>
have an active ingredient concentration of 10 to 10,000 ppm, while formula¬tions such as granules and dusts are usually used as such.<br>
The pesticidal composition of the present invention can be used by foliar treatment to plants such as crop plants to be protected from pests or can also be used by treatment to seedbeds prior to tjie planting of crop plant seedlings or to planting holes or plant bottoms in the planting. Further, for the purpose of controlling pests inhabiting the soil of a cultivated land, the pesticidal composition of the present invention may also be used by treat¬ment to the soil. The pesticidal composition of the present invention can also be used by winding a resin formulation processed into a sheet, string, or cord form around crop plants, or by stretching it in the vicinity of crop plants and/or laying it on the soil surface at the plant bottom.<br>
The pesticidal composition of the present invention can also be used in admixture or combination with other insecticides, nematocides, acaricides, bactericides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, synergists, fer¬tilizers, soil conditioners, animal feeds, and the like.<br>
The insecticide and/or acaricide and/or nematocide which can be used may include, for example, organophosphorus compounds such as Fenitro-thion.

After the chemical solution sprayed to the cucumber were dried, the first true leaf was cut off and placed on a filter paper (70 mm in diameter) impregnated with water in a polyethylene cup (110 mm in diameter). Thirty larvae of Frankliniella occidentahs (Western flower thrips) were set free on the iirst true leaf, which was covered with a polyethylene cup. After seven days, the number of surviving pests was ex¬amined.<br>
As a result, the number of siuiving pests was 0 on the leaves treated with each of the present compounds (2), (4), (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), (14), (16), (17), (19) to (24), (26), (28), (29), (34), (36) to (38), and (40). Test Example 3 Ten parts of each of the present compounds (2) to (8), (10) to (32) and<br><br>
(34) to (40); white carbon containing 50 parts of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate ammonium salt; and 55 parts of water were mixed and pulverized by the wet grinding method to give a formulation for each compound. formulation of each present compound was diluted with water so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a spray solution. A polyethylene cup was seeded with cabbage and a plant was grown until the first true leaf was developed. The first true leaf was left, while the other leaves were cut off. Adults of Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) were set free on the first true leaf and allowed to lay eggs for about 24 hours. The cabbage leaf with about 80 to 100 eggs thus laid thereon was kept in a greenhouse. On eighth day after, when greater part of the larvae were hatching from the laid eggs, the above spray solution was applied at a ratio of 20 ml/cup to the cabbage plant. On the seventh day after the application, the number of surviving larvae was counted.<br>
As a result, the number of surviving larvae was not greater than 10 on the cabbage leaves treated with each of the present compounds (2) to (8), (10) to (32) and (34) to (40). Test Example 4<br>
Ten parts of each of the present compounds (1) to (23) and (25) to (40); white carbon containing 50 parts of polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate am¬monium salt; and 55 parts of water were mixed and pulverized by the wet grinding method to give a formulation for each compound. The formulation of each present compound obtained according to Formulation Example 5 was diluted so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a spray solution-Fifty grams of molding Bonsoru 2 (available from Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) was put into a polyethylene cup, and 10 to 15 seeds of rice were planted in the polyethylene cup.   Then rice plants were grown until the<br><br>
second foliage leaves developed and then cut into the same height of 5 cm. The above spray solution was applied at the rate of 20 ml/cup to these rice plants. After the chemical solution sprayed onto the rice plants were dried, thirty first-instar larvae of Nilaparvata lugens (brown planthopper) were set free on the rice plants, which was then left in a greenhouse at 25°C. On the sixth Say after the release of larvae of Nilaparvata lugens, the number of parasitic Nilaparvata lugens on the rice plants was examined.<br>
As a result, in the treatment with each of the present compounds (1) to (23) and (25) to (40), the number of parasitic Nilaparvata lugens on the sixth day after the treatment was not greater than 3.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The present compounds have excellent pesticidal activity, and there¬fore, they are useful as the active ingredients of pesticidal compositions.<br><br><br><br>

4.	The pyrimidine compound as claimed in any one of claims 1 to<br>
3, wherein R2 is hydrogen.<br>
5.	A pesticidal composition comprising a pyrimidine compound<br>
as claimed in claim 1 as an active ingredient.<br>
