The present invention relates to a composition containing a C1ystalline polypropylene resin and one or more specific trimesic acid derivatives capable of acting as a nucleating agent for the formation of the p-C1ystal form, to the use of these derivatives as P-nucleating agents and to articles made from a polypropylene resin containing the p-form C1ystals.<br>
It is known that C1ystalline polypropylene may occur in a, p, yand 8 C1ystal forms as well as in the smectic C1ystal form which is formed on quenching of melted polypropylene. The p-C1ystal form (hereinafter referred to as "P-fomn") differs from the more common a-form which is found, for instance, in the conventional natural pellets in that it is lower in melting point and in density, not to speak of differences in the mode of C1ystallization and of fracture, thus being of interest from application points of view.<br>
The p-form of polypropylene is less stable compared with the corresponding a-form under usual processing conditions. When melts of polypropylene are extruded and then cooled the a-form of polypropylene tends to predominate. However, polypropylene containing high contents of the p-form can be prepared by the addition of a suitable nucleating agent which induces the formation of the p-form when the polypropylene is molten and subsequently cooled.<br>
US-B-6,235,823 desC1ibes the use of diamide compounds as p-nucleating agents. EP-A-940,431 and JP-A-Hei 06/192,496 disclose the use of several trimesic acid derivatives as nucleating agents in general, however, without differentiating between the several C1ystal forms. Not any nucleating agent for polypropylene resins does necessarily induce the formation of the p-C1ystal form.<br>
EP-A-865,914 and EP-A-865,911 desC1ibe polyolefin films. Poiybutene-1 resin compositions are disclosed in EP-A-776,933, and porous stretched articles of polypropylene based resin are desC1ibed in EP-A-632,095.<br>
The present invention relates in particular to a composition containing<br>
(2) one or more p-nucleating agents of the formula (I),   wherein<br>

p-form C1ystal content (%) = 100 x Pp,/(Pal + P^ + P^ + Ppi)<br>
where Pa, to P^ are respective peak heights (maxima) of the a-form and Ppi is a peak height (maximum) of the p-form determined by wide angle X-ray scattering.<br>
P(M is a reflection intensity (height) on (300) plane of p-form C1ystal. Pal is a reflection intensity (height) on (110) plane of a-form C1ystal. Po2 is a reflection intensity (height) on (040) plane of a-form C1ystal. Pa3 is a reflection intensity (height) on (130) plane of a-form C1ystal.<br>
The p-form C1ystal content may be determined as desC1ibed by A. Turner Jones et al. in Makromol. Chem. 75, 134 (1964) or as desC1ibed in US-A-5,491,188.<br>

The amount of the p-nucleating agent (component (2)) to be added to the polypropylene resin is not C1itical insofar as the desired effect can be obtained. Generally, it is used in an amount effective for inC1easing the content of the p-C1ystal form. 0.0001 to 5 %, in particular 0.001 to 2 %, 0.05 to 1 %, 0.1 to 1 % or 0.15 to 1 %, relative to the weight of component (1), are suitable.<br>
Thus, the p-nucleating agent of the invention is capable of causing a C1ystalline polypropylene resin to undergo transition to the p-C1ystal form at a very low level of addition and a molded product having a p-form C1ystal content as indicated above can be obtained under suitable molding conditions.<br>
Component (3) is preferably present in the composition according to the present invention in an amount of 1 to 90 %, for example 2 to 80 % or 5 to 50 %, relative to the weight of component (1).<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention is a method for providing a polypropylene resin with a content of p-form C1ystals of at least 10 % calculated by means of the following equation<br>
p-form C1ystal content (%) = 100 x Pp,/(Pa, + P^ + Pa3 + Ppi)<br>
where PaI to P^ are respective peak heights (maxima) of the a-form and Pp! is a peak height (maximum) of the p-form determined by wide angle X-ray scattering, which comprises incorporating into the polypropylene resin one or more p-nucleating agents of the formula (I).<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is the use of a compound of the formula (I) as P-nucleating agent for a polypropylene resin.<br>
The resin compositions of the present invention may be prepared by standard procedures, well known to those skilled in the art, of compounding, such as mixing the presC1ibed components in a conventional mixer by e.g. dry-blending or solution spraying and melting and kneading the mixture with a single- or twin-sC1ew extruder, or the like.<br>
The p-nucleating agent of the formula (I) can be added to the polypropylene resin at an optional stage, i.e. either during the polymerization reaction or after the polymer has been prepared.<br>
To the resin compositions of the present invention, additional materials can be added in a concentration range that does not adversely affect the beneficial effects of the invention. These materials may include stabilizers, antioxidants, antibacterial agents, ultraviolet absorbers, thermostabilizers, light stabilizers, neutralizers, antistatic agents, antiblocking agents, heavy metal inactivation agents, flame retardants, lubricants, peroxides, hydrotalcite, foaming agents, elastomers, processing aids, additional nucleating agents, reinforcing matter, plasticizer and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>

The resulting C1ystalline polypropylene resin composition of the present invention are preferably molded by injection, compression, blow molding, roto molding and / or other known molding techniques utilizing the conventional molding machines. Molding conditions may be those commonly employed. Typical preferred molding conditions may be as follows. Injection molding: resin temperature about 180 to 320°C, preferably about 200 to 300°C; mold temperature about 0 to 120°C, preferably about 30 to 80°C. Blow molding: resin temperature about 180 to 300°C, preferably about 200 to 280°C; mold temperature about 20 to 140°C, preferably about 60 to 120°C. Compression molding: temperature of melted resin about 180 to 300°C, preferably about 200 to 280°C; cooling temperature about 10 to 125°C, preferably about 30 to 100°C.<br>
Molded products, which contain much higher proportion of p-C1ystal form than the reference material and which are satisfactory in the aspect of color, can be easily obtained by molding under the above-mentioned molding condition the resin composition of the invention prepared with use of, for instance, the above-mentioned mixing method. Compared with the conventional polypropylene pellet which normally does not substantially contain p-C1ystals but is predominantly composed of a-C1ystals, the polypropylene molded product has a lower melting point and requires a lower force for deformation under heating. Therefore, the molded products contribute a great deal to improved secondary processability and mechanical characteristics. The products encompass a wide variety of forms such as packaging, containers, bumpers, housing, technical article (e.g. gear) and so on.<br>
With the resin compositions of the present invention, the ratio of a- to p-form in the final product can be controlled as desired by suitable solidification conditions. It is possible to control the ratio of a- to p-form by appropriately selecting cooling conditions under the above molding condition. This characteristic is beneficial particularly in the surface roughening of, for instance, biaxially oriented films and fibres. The film having such a roughened surface displays excellent antiblocking property, printability and adhesion, etc. and is of great use in the fields of packaging film, printing paper, tracing paper, oil-immersion type plastic capacitors and so on.<br>

The general procedures used in Working Example I are desC1ibed below. Mixing Procedure:<br>
To 59.91 g of powdered polypropylene (ELF-Atochem (RTM); Appryl 3030BN1 (RTM)) 90 mg of a powdered additive (0.15 % by weight) or a powdered mixture of additives (total 0.15 % by weight) is added, and tumble-mixed for 24 h in a glass container. In general, 4.5 g of this mixture are compounded at 239 °C in a small-scale, laboratory twin-sC1ew, recirculating and corotating extruder, for example the MiC1oCompounder of DACA Instruments (RTM), for a period of about 4 min at a sC1ew speed of 40 rpm, and subsequently collected at room temperature. The neat polypropylene is similarly treated to produce a blank control sample.<br>
Differential-Scanning Calorimetrv (DSC):<br>
A Perkin-Elmer DSC instrument (RTM) (Model DSC 7), operated in a dry nitrogen atmosphere, is used for the analysis of the C1ystallization behavior of the various mixtures and control samples, according to standard procedures. About 5 to 10 mg of sample is sealed into an aluminum cup, heated from 130°C to 230°C at a rate of 10°C/min, held at 230°C for 5 min, and then subsequently cooled at a rate of 10°C/min to 50 °C. The data represented as C1ystallization temperatures are the peak temperatures of the exotherms (predominant peak minimum) in the thermograms that are recorded upon cooling.<br>
Injection molding:<br>
The injection molding is performed with a MiC1olnjector (DACA Instruments (RTM)). About 3.0 g of the pelletized thread is placed under a nitrogen blanket in the barrel at 260 °C. After the granulate is completely molten, the melt is injected into a polished mold with a pressure of about 8 bar. The mold temperature is 20 °C. The collected test specimen has a diameter of 2.5 cm and a thickness of about 1.1-1.2 mm.<br>
Optical Characterization (Transmission, Clarity. Haze):<br>
Transmission, clarity and haze are measured with a haze-gard plus instrument (BYK, Gardner (RTM), illumination CIE-C) at room temperature. The haze-gard plus instrument conforms to ASTM D-1003. The transmission, clarity and haze values are measured between 12-24 hours after obtaining the samples by injection molding.<br>
Determination of the B-form C1ystal content by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) A Bruker (RTM) wide angle X-ray diffractometer (Model D8 Advance) is used for the analysis of the p-modification content of the injection molded specimen prepared as desC1ibed above.<br>
The test specimen is placed in a sample holder in the middle between the copper Ka radiation source (X = 1.54178 A) and the detector. The sample is placed in a position so that the machine direction (MD) is parallel to the slit-shaped beam. This position is used for the determination of the P-form C1ystal content. The diffraction pattern is recorded from 2 0 = 8- 30°. The p-form C1ystal content is determined as desC1ibed by A. Turner Jones et al., Makromol. Chem. 75,134 (1964) and in US-A-5,491,188 according to the following equation:<br>
P-form C1ystal content (%) = 100 x Ppi/(Pa, + P^ + Pa3 + Ppi)<br>
where Pal to Pa3 means the maximum peak heights of the a-form and PPi means the maximum peak height of the p-form determined by wide angle X-ray scattering.<br>
Pp, is a reflection intensity (height) on (300) plane of p-form C1ystal. Pai is a reflection intensity (height) on (110) plane of a-form C1ystal. Po2 is a reflection intensity (height) on (040) plane of a-form C1ystal. P^ is a reflection intensity (height) on (130) plane of a-form C1ystal.<br>
