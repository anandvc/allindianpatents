				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds. This invention particularly relates to a process for the aralkylation of aromatic compound by aromatic alkylating or aralkylating agent for preparing aralkylated aromatic compounds, using a supported solid catalyst. This invention more particularly relates to a process for the aralkylation of aromatic compound by aromatic alkylating- or aralkylating agent for preparing aralkylated aromatic compounds, using a reusable and easily separable supported solid catalyst, comprising mixed metal oxides or halides deposited on a porous catalyst carrier or support, disclosed in our earlier patent application no. NF 98/98.<br>
The process for this invention could be used for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds, which are fine chemicals and/or intermediates used in the preparation of fine chemicals.<br>
Aralkylated aromatic compounds are useful fine chemicals and these are also used as<br>
intermediates in a number of organic syntheses. Both the homogeneous and heterogeneous<br>
catalysed liquid phase processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are<br>
known in the prior ari.	<br>

A French patent, Fr. Demande 2,144,578(1973), disclosed that substituted phenols p-RC6H4OH (where R=halogen or C1-4-alkyl) are benzylated by benzyl halides in th. presence of ZnCl2. A USSR patent, U.S.S.R. 394,353(1973), disclosea preparation of 2.6- and 2.4-(CH:,O:.. C6H3CH2C6H5 by treating m-(CH30)2C6H4 with benzyl chloride in the presence of<br><br><br>
catalyst at 145- 150°C, or SnCl2 catalyst at 165-170°C. A Japanese patent, Japan Kokai 7399,154(1973), disclosed preparation of dibenzyl benzene derivatives by benzylation of<br>
*•"«««•,,,.,,*.,.  -,. n,^v* ... .,<br>
benzene or substituted benzenes using Friedel-Crafts catalyst e.g., A1C13, FeCl3 and 98% H2S04. According to this patent, 200 g α-methyl benzyl chloride was added to a refluxing mixture of 500 g benzene and 5 g A1C13 and the whole mixture refluxed for 5h to give 120 g α-methyl bezylbenzene.<br>
According to a German patent, Ger. Offen 2,456,747 (1976), o-benzyltoluenes were prepared in -90% yields by the reaction of a o-chloromethyltoluene with a benzene derivative in &gt; 1:7 ratio in the presence of H2SO4 and/or H3PO4 and optionally 4-CH3C6H4SO3H, ZnCl2, BF3) etc. Thus 135 parts 85% H3PO4. 270 parts 85% H2S04, 10 parts 4-CH3C6H4SO3H, 70 pans 2CH3C6H4CH2C1 and 390 parts of C6H6 were heated at 75-80° C for 4h to give 89% 2-<br>

alkylmercapto, aryl, aryloxy or arylmercapto), with ArCH2X (Ar = corresponding aryl nucleus; X = halo, arylcarboxy, phenylsulfatoxy, hydroxy, alkoxy etc.) in a continuously functioning distillation apparatus in the presence of dissolved acid catalyst.<br>
The main disadvantages of the homogeneous acid catalyzed processes are as follows:<br>
1)	The separation and recovery of the dissolved acid catalysts from the liquid reaction mixture<br>
is difficult.<br>
2)	The disposal of the used acid catalysts creates environmental pollution.<br>
3)	The homogeneous acid catalysts also pose several other problems such as high toxicity,<br>
corrosion, spent acid disposal and use of more than the stoichiomeiric amount.<br>
Heterogeneous acid catalyzed processes	i<br>

The 2-CH3C6H4CH2Cl was stirred with toluene and Al-silicate (25% A1203) at 110°C to give 81% 2-methylbenzyltoluene. According to a Japanese patent, Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 59,180,937 (1984), o-benzylphenol was prepared by the liquid ;-these reaction o: benzyl alcohol with phenol in the presence of γ-A!2O3.

A German   patent, Ger. Offen DE 3,836,780 (1990), disclosed the process for the preparation of benzylbenzenes from benzenes and benzyl alcohols in the presence of activated<br><br>
bleaching earth and a diluent at 90-140°C. According to Japanese patent, Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 03,170,442 (1991),&gt;beTizylbiphenyls are manufactured by benzylating biphenyl and diphenylmethane with &gt; 1 compound from benzyl halides, benzyl alcohol, benzyl ether in the presence of a zeolite or silica-alumina catalyst. An European patent, Eur.Pat. appl. EP 428,081 (1991), disclosed a process of benzylation of alkylbenzenes with benzyl chloride in the presence of H-Y or H-L zeolite catalyst. According to a German patent, Ger. Offen DE 4,038,933 (1992), disclosed a process for benzylation of aromatics using technical carbon catalysts.<br>
Aralkylation of aromatic compounds by aralkylating agent involves electrophilic substitution of H from the aromatic nucleus. It is well known in the prior an that the electrophilic substitution is favoured by the presence of electron donating groups, such as OH, alkyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, amine, alkyl amine, SH etc., in the aromatic compound to be aralkylated. Whereas in the absence of the electron donating groups, e.g. for benzene, naphthalene and anthracene, the aralkylation is relatively difficult [ref. G.A.Olah. in Friedel-Crafts and related reactions, Wiley-Interscience Publ., New York, 1963].<br>
Although some limitations of the homogeneous acid catalyzed processes arc overcome by the prior art heterogeneous catalyzed processes described above, the araikylati:,.; activity of the solid catalysts used in the above processes are low, particularly fcr araikylating aromatic compounds not containing electron donating groups. Hence there is a p?a: practical need for developing a process for the aral'-\'!ation of aromatic comnounds with araikylating agent, using more efficient, easily separable and reusable solid catalyst. There is also a need for developing a catalytic process for the aralkylation of aromatic compounds not containing electron donating groups, usmg highly efficient, easily separable and reusable solid catalyst.<br><br>
Very recently, in our patent application no. NF 98/98, we have disclosed a supported solid catalyst, comprising mixed metal oxides or halides deposited on micro-, meso- or macroporous catalyst carrier or support, useful for Friedel-Crafts reactions and also a process for the preparation of this catalyst. The said catalyst is represented by a general formula: AaMZb(c)/S,<br>
wherein, A is selected from chemical elements Ga, Al, B, Zn, Fe, Sn, Ti, Th, Zr or a mixture of two or more thereof; M is selected from chemical elements In, TI or a mixture thereof; Z is selected from chemical elements 0, Cl, Br or I; S is porous catalyst support or carrier; a is AIM mole ratio in the range of about 0.001 to about 100; b is number of atoms of Z needed to fulfil the valence requirement of the metallic elements AaM present in the supported catalyst; c is weight percentage loading of AaMZb deposited on said catalyst support or carrier (S) in the range of about 0.5 to about 50.<br>
This invention is made with the following objects so that most of the drawbacks or limitations of the prior art homogeneous and heterogeneous catalyzed processes for the aralkylation of aromatic compounds could be overcome.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improv ed process preparation of aralkylated aromatic compound. Another object 01 mis  :; ertion is to provide a liquid phase process for the aralkylation &gt;f aromatic compound, with or without conu::n:n: electron donating groap. using a highly active supported solid catalyst   on;rrisi::2 mixed nc: oxides or halides deposited on rn.cro-, me so- or macroporous catalyst came; or iuppori. • ;r: has high activity not only when the aromatic ring activating groups   (i.e. electron donating groups such as alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy, phenoxy, etc.) are present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated but also when the ring activating group in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated is<br><br>
absent, so that the reaction temperature is low and/or time for completing the reaction is short;<br>
Other important object of this invention is to provide a liquid phase process for the aralkylation of aromatic compounds using said supported solid catalyst which is easily separable and reusable in the processs for several times.<br>

weight percentage loading of AaMZb deposited on said catalyst support or carrier (S) in the<br>
range of about 0.5 to about 50, disclosed in our earlier patent application no. NF 98/98;<br>
wherein, said process comprises:<br>
i) pretreating said solid catalyst at a temperature between 100°C and 800°C in a flow of<br>
moisture-free air or inert gas at a gas hourly space velocity in the range 1000 - 20000 cm3g-1'h-1<br>
or under vacuum, for a period between 0.1 h and 10 h,<br>
ii) contacting a liquid mixture of aromatic compound and aralkylating agent having a mole ratio<br>
of aromatic compound to aralkylating agent between 0.1 and 100, in the absence or presence of<br>
a solvent, with said pretreated supported solid catalyst at a weidr ^atio of said catalyst to<br>
arakylating agent between 0.02 and 2.0 in a stirred batch reactor in the presence of an inert gas<br>
bubbling through the reaction mixture and allowing the reaction to occur at a temperature<br>
between 25°C and 300°C at a nressure between 1 arm and 10 atm for a reaction oerio.i between<br>
0.01 hand 50 h,<br>
iii) cooling the reaction mixture to a temperature about 25°C, removing said catalyst from the<br>
reaction mixture by filtration and then separating the reaction products from the reaction<br>
mixture by the known methods.<br><br>
The main finding of this invention is that, the said catalyst shows high activity in the aralkylation of aromatic compounds not only when the electron donating group, which is aromatic ring activating group, is present in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated but also when the electron donating group is absent in the aromatic ring to be aralkylated and hence the reaction temperature is low and/or the time required for completing the reaction is short.<br>
Other important finding of this invention is that said solid catalyst can be separated easily and reused repeatedly in the process. Another important finding of this invention is that the aralkylation of aromatic compound over said catalyst occurs with high reaction rates even in the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture (i.e. a mixture of aromatic compound to be aralkylated, aralkylating agent, solid catalyst and solvent, if used). Yet another important finding of this invention is that the mechanism of the aralkylation of aromatic compounds over said solid catalyst is different from that of acid catalyzed Friedel-Crafts aralkylation reaction.<br>
Higher aromatic hydrocarbons may be aryl benzenes and alkyl or aryl polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The process of this invention can be carried out in a stirred batch reactor, fitted with a reflux condenser and arrangement for bubbling inert gas through the reaction mixture, known in the prior art for carrying out liquid rmase reactions.<br>
In the process of this invention, the main products formed are aralkylated aromatic compound and a by-product HX, wherein H =. .lydrogen and X = halogen or OH or SO^H or COOH or OCnH2nC6H5 or OCnH2-1 or arylcarboxy group or alkylcarboxy group, depending upon said aralkylating agent used.<br>
In the process of this invention, aromatic compound and aralkylating agent are reactants and are converted partially or completely to said products.<br><br>
In the process of this invention, the role of said solvent, if used, is to dissolve solid reactant or reactants, to dilute reactants and/or to facilitate the reaction between aromatic compound and aralkylating agent. However, solvent may not be used in the process of this invention when both the reactants are liquid at said reaction conditions. Normally, said solvent is not converse! in the process of this invention.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of inert gas bubbling continuously through the reaction mixture is to remove continuously said by-product from the reaction mixture so ±at the reverse reaction is avoided or minimised and the time required for completing the reaction is shortened.<br>
In the process of this invention, the role of the reflux condenser fitted with the reac:or is to condense reactants and solvents and to return them back to the reaction mixture and allow the inert gas, which is continuously bubbling through the reaction mixture, along with said byproduct to escape from the reaction mixture.<br>
In the process of this invention, the reaction pressure above atmospheric pressure may be used to allow the reaction to be carried out at temperature higher than the normal bc:iing point of the reactants and/or solvent, by increasing the boiling point of said reactants ^zd'or solvent with increasing the reaction pressure.<br>
Said catalyst, used in the process of this invention, is heterogeneous with respect :c the reaction mixture and can be removed from the reaction mixture simply by filtration and the removed catalyst, after washing with solvent or saici liquid aromatic compound, which is :o be aralkylated, can be reused in the said process.<br>
Said pretreatment to said catalyst in sten-i of the process of present inventen is necessary for removing moisture and other adsorbates adsorbed on the catalyst so that the catalyst shows its full efficiency for catalyzing the aralkylation reaction.<br><br>
The role of said catalyst is to activate both the reactants, aromatic compound and aralkylating agent. The R1R2C6H3CnH2n,----X bond of said aralkylating agent is weakened by its interaction with the catalyst, leading to the formation of a stable carbocation [RjR2C6H3CnH:n]+ (I) and X-. In the presence of said carbocation (I), said aromatic compound is activated on the said catalyst by weakening its bond between aromatic nucleus and H, leading to the formation of a penta-coordinated carbocation by the combination of said activated aromatic compound and said carbocation (I). The said penta-coordinated carbocation is then decomposed to an aralkylated aromatic compound, the main product of the reaction, and a proton, which combines with X~ to give HX, the by-product of the reaction.<br>

The main advantages of the process of this invention over the prior art processes for the aralkylation of aromatic compound are as follows:<br>
1)     The process of this invention has a number of advantages over the earlier homogeneous catalysed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds, as follows: In the process of this invention,<br>
i) the catalyst used is heterogeneous solid catalyst and hence it can be separated from the reaction products simply by filtration ,<br>
ii) the separated catalysts can be reused in the process for a number of times, and iii) also the catalyst is non corrosive, therefore most of the serious problems associated with homogeneous catalyst used in the earlier homogeneous catalysed processes for the preparation of aralkylated aromatic compounds are overcome in the process of this invention.<br>
2) The process of this invention has also number of advantages over the prior art processes based on the use of solid catalyst for the aralkylation of aromatic compounds, as follows:<br>
i) The activity of the said catalyst used in the process of presem invention is much<br>
higher and hence the reaction is much faster and thereby the lime required for<br>
completing the reaction is much shorter.<br>
ii) The process of the present invention can be used for aralkyativ.   both small and large<br>
size aromatic compounds with both small and large size aralkyiating agents to produce<br>
the   corresponding   aralkylated   compounds,   using   said   supported   solid   catalyst<br>
containing meso- or macroporous catalyst carrier.<br>
iii) In the process of this invention, since moisture-free inert gas is bubbled through the<br>
reaction mixture continuously, said by-product formed in the reaction is removed<br><br>
continuously and thereby the reverse aralkylation reaction is avoided or minimised, thus<br>
requiring shorter time for completing the reaction.<br>
iv) In the process of this invention, by using pressure higher than 1 atm, it is possible to<br>
carry out the aralkylation reaction at a temperature higher than the normal boiling point<br>
of either of the reactants and the solvent, and thereby the reaction period for completing<br>
the reaction is shortened and/or the inhibition of the reaction due to strong adsorption of<br>
the reactants, products or solvent on the catalyst is avoided or minimised.<br>
v) By the process of this invention, even the aralkylation of benzene, naphthalene or<br>
anthracene, which does not contain any aromatic ring activating electron donating group<br>
such as alkyl, alkoxy, hydroxy etc. group, at mild reaction conditions is rapid and hence<br>
accomplished at shorter reaction periods.<br>
vi) Moreover, using the supported solid catalyst of this invention, a rapid aralkylation of<br>
aromatic compound is possible even when the reaction mixture contains moisture; the<br>
catalyst is not deactivated by the presence of moisture in the reaction mixture.<br><br><br>
