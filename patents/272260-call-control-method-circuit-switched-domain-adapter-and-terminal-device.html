				<td>The present application claims the priority of the Chinese patent application<br>
No.200710090412.9 entitled "Call Control Method, Circuit-Switched Domain Adapter and<br>
Terminal Device" filed with the Chinese Patent Office on April 6, 2007, the entirety of which<br>
is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to communication technique field, and particularly to a<br>
call control method, a circuit-switched domain adapter and a terminal device.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
At present, mobile communication networks are mostly circuit-switched (CS)<br>
networks, which include Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) and so on. Operators have built up relatively complete and rich<br>
service platforms based on the CS networks in which Mobile Switching Center (MSC) is<br>
responsible for call routing and service logic executing, such as call forwarding service, call<br>
hold service and so on.<br>
Service provision in a CS network needs to be supported by a MSC in a roaming<br>
region, which is inconvenient for introducing new services. IP Multimedia Sub-system<br>
(IMS) is a packet-switched (PS) service network in which service provision is independent<br>
from a roaming region, which facilitates to introduce new multimedia services. The IMS<br>
supports a User End (UE) to obtain PS IMS multimedia services through various PS access<br>
networks.<br>
The PS IMS network is a trend for the development of future communication<br>
networks. However, the IMS network is also a relatively complex network. It can be<br>
foreseen that thorough deployment of the PS IMS network will not be completed in a short<br>
time, and meanwhile not all CS network users could employ new IMS terminals in a short<br>
time. Therefore the CS networks will coexist with the IMS networks in a long time, and thus<br>
it is needed to operate the CS networks and the IMS networks simultaneously.<br>
An existing technique for implementing coexistence of networks realizes the<br>
interworking between the CS networks and the IMS networks through specific network<br>
interfaces. For example, Media Gateway Controller (MGC) is introduced for converting<br>
 <br>
different call protocols of two networks. The MGC is a logic functional entity for realizing<br>
Media Gateway Control Function (MGCF).<br>
The related art could realize the communication between the CS networks and the<br>
IMS networks, which, however, encounters the following problems.<br>
In the CS networks, a CS service control platform provides services for CS users,<br>
while in the PS networks, an IMS service control platform provides services for IMS users.<br>
The simultaneous operation of the service control platforms of the two networks greatly<br>
increases operation costs. Moreover, when introducing new services, it is necessary to<br>
implement configurations and updates in the CS service control platform and the IMS service<br>
control platform at the same time, which brings difficulties for the introduction of the new<br>
services.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention provide a call control method, a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter and a terminal device to realize a call control to the circuit-<br>

device in a circuit-switched domain; routing the call request to a circuit-switched domain<br>
adapter; requesting, by the circuit-switched domain adapter, the called terminal device to<br>
establish a circuit-switched call leg; and establishing a call between an initiator of the call<br>
request and a forwarding target of the called terminal device if a message which is returned<br>
by the called terminal device and received by the packet-switched domain server through the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter satisfies preset trigger conditions.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a circuit-switched domain adapter,<br>
including: a circuit call leg establishing unit, configured to establish a circuit-switched call<br>
leg with a terminal device; a packet call leg establishing unit, configured to establish a<br>
packet-switched call leg with a second party; and a call leg binding unit, configured to<br>
 <br>
establish a call connection between the terminal device and the second party through binding<br>
the circuit-switched call leg and the packet-switched call leg.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a terminal device, including: a<br>
circuit call leg establishing unit, configured to establish a circuit-switched call leg with a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter; a control information generating unit, configured to<br>
generate call control information intended for the circuit-switched domain adapter after the<br>
circuit-switched call leg is established; and a control information transmitting unit,<br>
configured to transmit the call control information generated by the control information<br>
generating unit to the circuit-switched domain adapter through a packet-switched access<br>
network or a circuit-switched network.<br>
It can be seen from the above technical solutions that the embodiments of the present<br>
invention realize a call control to a circuit-switched terminal device by a packet-switched<br>
control platform through establishing a circuit-switched call leg with a terminal device, and<br>
establishing a packet-switched call connection between the terminal device and a second<br>
party under the control of a packet-switched domain server. Call control functions of a<br>
circuit-switched network are abandoned and a call control service is provided for the circuit-<br>
switched domain terminal device by the packet-switched domain server, thus centralizing<br>
control functions of the whole network, reducing network operation costs and making<br>
introduction of new services easier.<br>

DETAILED DESCRD?TION<br>
A call control method, a circuit-switched domain adapter and a terminal device<br>
proposed in the embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail as below.<br>
The First Embodiment<br>
A flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 1, which includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
In step 101, a circuit-switched call leg (CS Call Leg) is established between a terminal<br>
device and a circuit-switched domain adapter (CSA).<br>
It would be appreciated that the terminal device may be a network device for<br>
implementing circuit-switched communication, such as a mobile phone, a fixed-line phone, a<br>
network computer, a server and so on.<br>
In step 102, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and a second party.<br>
In step 103, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the circuit-switched call leg and the<br>
packet-switched call leg.<br>
Steps 102 and 103 may be understood as that a packet-switched call connection is<br>
established between the circuit-switched domain adapter, as a proxy for the terminal device,<br>
and the second party under the control of a packet-switched domain server.<br>
It would be appreciated that the packet-switched domain server is a functional entity<br>
for implementing call control in a packet-switched network, which may be a Telephone<br>
Application Server (TAS), a Call Server Control Function (CSCF) server and so on.<br>
 <br>
It would be appreciated that the packet-switched domain server may be a functional<br>
entity for implementing call control in an IMS network.<br>
In the present embodiment, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes the<br>
packet-switched call leg with the second party under the control of the packet-switched<br>
domain server.<br>
It would be appreciated that the circuit-switched domain adapter, as the proxy in the<br>
PS network for the terminal device, establishes a call with the second party, and the packet-<br>
switched domain server provides a call control service for a user through the proxy of the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention realizes a call control to the circuit-<br>
switched terminal device by a packet-switched control platform through establishing, the<br>
circuit-switched call leg between the terminal device and the circuit-switched domain adapter,<br>
and establishing the packet-switched call connection between the circuit-switched domain<br>
adapter which operates as the proxy of the terminal device and the second party under the<br>
control of the packet-switched domain server. Call control functions of a circuit-switched<br>
network are abandoned and the call control service is provided for the circuit-switched<br>
domain terminal device by the packet-switched domain server, thus centralizing control<br>
functions of the whole network, reducing network operation costs and making introduction of<br>
new services easier.<br>
The Second Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 2, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
In step 201, a circuit-switched call leg is established between a terminal device and a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 202, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and a second party under the control of a packet-switched domain server.<br>
It would be appreciated that the packet network involved in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention may be an IMS network in which the packet-switched call employs Session<br>
Initial Protocol (SIP) and the packet-switched call leg is a SIP call leg.<br>
In step 203, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the circuit-switched call leg and the<br>
packet-switched call leg.<br>
 <br>
In step 204, the terminal device transmits a call hold request containing an<br>
identification of a third party to the circuit-switched domain adapter through a circuit-<br>
switched network.<br>
The identification of the third party may be the third party's SIP Uniform Resource<br>
Identifier (URI), Telephone URI (Tel URI), Internet Protocol (IP) address, telephone number<br>
or other identification information that may identify a user. The present invention is not<br>
limited by specific identification information.<br>
In the present embodiment, the call hold request may be carried in an Unstructured<br>
Supplementary Service Data Request (USSD request) message transmitted to the circuit-<br>
switched domain adapter through the circuit-switched network.<br>
It would be appreciated that the terminal device may also have PS access capability<br>
and the call hold request may also be transmitted to the circuit-switched domain adapter<br>
through a packet-switched access network. For example, the terminal device may transmit<br>
the call hold request to the circuit-switched domain adapter through existing General Packet<br>
Radio Service (GPRS) network, and the call hold request may be transmitted through an<br>
Invite or Update message.<br>
In step 205, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits the call hold request to the<br>
second party through the packet-switched domain server so as to hold the established call leg<br>
with the second party.<br>
It would be appreciated that the two parties in the communication may transmit a call<br>
hold request to each other, and they would hold the current call after one another party agrees<br>
to hold.<br>
It would be appreciated that the call hold request transmitted by the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter to the second party may be carried in the Invite message or the Update<br>
message. The Invite message or Update message contains an identification instructing the<br>
second party to hold the established call leg with the circuit-switched domain adapter, and<br>
meanwhile, the packet-switched domain server may play a call hold tone for the second party<br>
to notify the user of the second party that the call is held. The hold operation means that a<br>
hold accepting party holds a call status with a hold request transmitting party but stops data<br>
transmission. In the present embodiment, the hold accepting party is the user terminal of the<br>
second party, and the hold request transmitting party is the circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
 <br>
In step 206, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and the third party under the control of the packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 207, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the third party through binding the circuit-switched call leg and the<br>
call leg with the third party.<br>
It would be appreciated that the following steps may be further included by the<br>
method after step 207.<br>
In step 208, the terminal device may also request a call resume with the second party<br>
from the circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
The terminal device transmits a call resume request with the second party to the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter through a packet-switched access network or a circuit-<br>
switched network.<br>
In step 209, the circuit-switched domain adapter requests the third party to hold the<br>
established call leg with the third party.<br>
The manner of holding the established call leg with the third party is identical with the<br>
manner of holding the established call leg with the second party in step 205.<br>
In step 210, the circuit-switched domain adapter resumes the call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the second party.<br>
It would be appreciated that in the present embodiment, the terminal device may<br>
continue to request a call resume from the circuit-switched domain adapter so as to realize the<br>
communication switching of the terminal device between the second party and the third party.<br>
On the basis of the first embodiment, the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
realizes that a packet-switched network service platform provides a call hold service for the<br>
circuit-switched network terminal device. Through reusing the circuit-switched call leg<br>
between the circuit-switched domain adapter and the terminal device, the implementation of<br>
the procedure of the call hold service becomes easier, thus saving CS network resources and<br>
decreasing the establishing time of a call connection.<br>
The Third Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 3, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
 <br>
In step 301, a circuit-switched call leg is established between a terminal device and a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 302, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and a second party under the control of a packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 303, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the second party.<br>
In step 304, a third party transmits a call request intended for the terminal device to<br>
the packet-switched domain server.<br>
In the present embodiment, the call request is an Invite message which contains an<br>
identification of the terminal device.<br>
In step 305, the packet-switched domain server transmits the call request to the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
It would be appreciated that the packet-switched domain server receives the call<br>
request and performs an initial Filter Criteria (iFC) check. If it is checked that the call<br>
request is intended for the circuit-switched domain terminal device, that is, the call is to be<br>
established through a circuit-switched network, the packet-switched domain server routes the<br>
call request to the circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
The iFC is a part of user subscribing information, which is service trigger information.<br>
The iFC is used to describe under what conditions an incoming SIP message is further routed<br>
to a specific application server. Typically, the SIP message may be an Invite message<br>
requesting to establish a call or a Register message for IMS registration.<br>
In step 306, the circuit-switched domain adapter delivers the call request of the third<br>
party to the terminal device.<br>
In the present embodiment, the delivered call request may be delivered to the terminal<br>
device through a circuit-switched network USSD Request message, and may also be<br>
delivered to the terminal device through a packet-switched access network.<br>
In step 307, the terminal device transmits a reply for accepting the call to the circuit-<br>
switched domain adapter.<br>
In the present embodiment, the reply may be transmitted to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter through a circuit-switched network USSD Request message, and may also be<br>
 <br>
transmitted to the circuit-switched domain adapter through the packet-switched access<br>
network.<br>
In step 308, the circuit-switched domain adapter receives the reply and transmits a call<br>
hold request to the second party to hold the established call leg with the second party.<br>
The manner of holding the established call leg with the second party may be referred<br>
to step 205 in the second embodiment.<br>
In step 309, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and the third party under the control of the packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 310, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the third party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the third party.<br>
It would be appreciated that after step 310, the terminal device may request a call<br>
resume from the circuit-switched domain adapter so as to realize the communication<br>
switching of the terminal device between the second party and the third party. Specific<br>
switching manner may be referred to steps 208 to 210 in the second embodiment.<br>
It would be appreciated that the order between step 309 and steps 305 to 308 is not<br>
limited. It is also possible that after step 304 in which the circuit-switched domain adapter<br>
receives the call request of the third party, step 309 is performed, in which the packet-<br>
switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched domain adapter and the third<br>
party under the control of the packet-switched domain server. If the terminal device returns<br>
the reply for accepting the call of the third party in step 307, the process proceeds to step 308.<br>
If the terminal device rejects to communicate with the third party, the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter may clear the established call leg with the third party in subsequent steps.<br>
The third embodiment of the present invention differs from the second embodiment in<br>
that the terminal device receives the call request of the third party during the communication<br>
with the second party, and if the terminal device accepts the call request, it holds the call<br>
connection with the second party and establishes the call connection with the third party.<br>
Through reusing the circuit-switched call leg, it is realized that a packet-switched platform<br>
provides a call waiting service for the circuit-switched terminal device.<br>
The Fourth Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 4, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
 <br>
Steps 401 to 407 in the present embodiment are identical with steps 201 to 207 in the<br>
second embodiment described above and thus are not further described here.<br>
In step 408, the terminal device transmits a call transfer request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter.<br>
The terminal device may transmit the call transfer request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter through a packet-switched access network or a circuit-switched network.<br>
In step 409, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits a call hold request to the<br>
third party to hold the established call leg with the third party.<br>
In step 410, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits the call transfer request to<br>
the second party, in which the call transfer request contains an identification of the third party.<br>
The call transfer request may be transmitted through an Invite message.<br>
In step 411, the second party accepts the call transfer request and returns an<br>
acknowledge message to the circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
The acknowledge message may be returned through a 200OK message.<br>
In step 412, the second party and the third party establish a call connection.<br>
Specifically, the second party and the third party may use conventional existing<br>
manners to establish the call connection, which are not further described in the present<br>
embodiment.<br>
Steps 410 to 412 are a specific implementation for the circuit-switched domain<br>
adapter to control the second party and the third party to establish the call connection. It<br>
would be appreciated that the circuit-switched domain adapter may also realize the<br>
establishment of the call connection between the second party and the third party through<br>
binding the established call legs between the circuit-switched domain adapter and the second<br>
or third party. The present invention is not limited by specific manners of establishing the<br>
call connection between the second party and the third party.<br>
After step 411, the established packet-switched call legs between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and the second or third party respectively are released in step 413.<br>
In step 414, after the call connection between the second party and the third party is<br>
established successfully, the second party returns a call transfer success message to the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
 <br>
In step 415, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits a USSD Request message<br>
to the terminal device through a circuit-switched network, in which the USSD Request<br>
message contains an identification indicating that the call transfer is successful.<br>
It would be appreciated that the circuit-switched domain adapter may also notify the<br>
terminal device of the call transfer success message through a packet-switched network.<br>
In step 416, the terminal device releases the established call leg with the circuit-<br>
switched domain adapter after receiving the call transfer success message.<br>
It would be appreciated that steps 401 to 407 in the present embodiment may be<br>
replaced with steps 301 to 310 in the third embodiment.<br>
On the basis of the method of the second or third embodiment, the fourth embodiment<br>
of the present invention realizes a method for a packet-switched control platform to provide a<br>
call transfer service for the circuit-switched terminal device.<br>
The Fifth Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 5, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
In step 501, a circuit-switched call leg is established between a terminal device and a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 502, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and the second party under the control of a packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 503, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the second party.<br>
In step 504, the terminal device transmits a call transfer request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter, in which the call transfer request includes an identification of a third party.<br>
The terminal device may transmit the call transfer request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter through a packet-switched access network or a circuit-switched network.<br>
In step 505, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits a call hold request to the<br>
second party to hold the established call leg with the second party.<br>
Steps 506 to 508 are steps in which the circuit-switched domain adapter controls the<br>
second party and the third party to establish a call connection, which are identical with steps<br>
410 to 412 in the fourth embodiment and thus are not further described here.<br>
 <br>
In step 509, after the second party returns an acknowledge message for accepting the<br>
call transfer, the circuit-switched domain adapter releases the established packet-switched<br>
call leg with the second party.<br>
In step 510, after the call connection between the second party and the third party is<br>
established successfully, the second party returns a call transfer success message to the<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 511, the circuit-switched domain adapter transmits the call transfer success<br>
message to the terminal device through the circuit-switched network. The call transfer<br>
success message may be transmitted through a USSD Request message which contains an<br>
identification indicating that the call transfer is successful.<br>
It would be appreciated that the circuit-switched domain adapter may also notify the<br>
terminal device of the call transfer success message through the packet-switched network.<br>
In step 512, the terminal device releases the established circuit-switched call leg with<br>
the circuit-switched domain adapter after receiving the call transfer success message.<br>
The fifth embodiment of the present invention differs from the fourth embodiment in<br>
that: the circuit-switched domain adapter does not establish a call leg with the third party; the<br>
terminal device directly transmits the call transfer request and notifies the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter of the identification of the third party to be transferred to; and the second<br>
party establishes the call connection with the third party so as to realize the call transfer.<br>
The Sixth Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 6, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
In step 601, a circuit-switched call leg is established between a terminal device and a<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 602, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and a second party under the control of a packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 603, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the second party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the second party.<br>
In step 604, the second party transmits a call hold request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter to hold the established call leg with the circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
 <br>
In step 605, the second party transmits a call transfer request to the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter, in which the call transfer request contains an identification of a third party.<br>
In step 606, a packet-switched call leg is established between the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter and the third party under the control of the packet-switched domain server.<br>
In step 607, the circuit-switched domain adapter establishes a call connection between<br>
the terminal device and the third party through binding the established call leg with the<br>
terminal device and the established call leg with the third party.<br>
In step 608, the circuit-switched domain adapter interacts with the second party to<br>
release the established call leg with the second party.<br>
In the sixth embodiment of the present invention, the call transfer request is initiated<br>
by the second party, the terminal device establishes the call connection with the third party,<br>
and the second party exits the call. It is realized that a packet-switched platform provides a<br>
passive call transfer service for the circuit-switched network terminal device.<br>
The Seventh Embodiment<br>
A signaling flowchart of a call control method is shown in Fig. 7, which includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
In step 701, a packet-switched domain server receives a call request intended for a<br>
called terminal device in a circuit-switched domain.<br>
It would be appreciated that the packet-switched domain server performs an iFC<br>
check after receiving the call request. If it is checked that the call request is intended for the<br>
circuit-switched domain terminal device, the packet-switched domain server routes the call<br>
request to a circuit-switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 702, the packet-switched domain server routes the call request to the circuit-<br>
switched domain adapter.<br>
In step 703, the circuit-switched domain adapter requests the called terminal device to<br>
establish a circuit-switched call leg.<br>
Specifically, requesting to establish the circuit-switched call leg may include:<br>
transmitting, by the circuit-switched domain adapter, an Invite message to a media gateway<br>
controller; transmitting, by the media gateway controller, an Initial Address Message (LAM)<br>
to a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) that provides services for the called terminal device;<br>
and transmitting, by the MSC, a call setup message to the called terminal device.<br>
 <br>
It would be appreciated that the circuit-switched domain adapter may transmit the<br>
calling party's call request to the called terminal device through a circuit-switched network,<br>
during which various implementations are possible for specific transmitted messages and<br>
message transmission paths. The present invention is not limited by specific transmitted<br>
messages and message transmission paths.<br>
In step 704, if preset trigger conditions are satisfied, the packet-switched domain<br>
server establishes a call between an initiator of the call request and a forwarding target of the<br>
called terminal device.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the preset trigger conditions may include<br>
any one of or any combination of the following four conditions.<br>
I.	The packet-switched domain server receives a message, indicating that the called<br>
terminal device is busy, returned by the called terminal device through the circuit-switched<br>
domain adapter.<br>
It would be appreciated that the fact that the called user terminal device is busy may<br>
means that: after the called terminal device receives the call establishing request, the user<br>
rejects the communication through certain operations and returns the message indicating that<br>
the called terminal device is busy; or after the MSC receives the call request, the MSC detects<br>
that the called terminal device is being in communication and then directly returns the<br>
message indicating that the called terminal device is busy.<br>
II.	The packet-switched domain server receives a forwarding request message<br>
returned by the called terminal device through the circuit-switched domain adapter, in which<br>
the forwarding request message contains an identification of the forwarding target.<br>
The user may transmit the request for forwarding the current call to the packet-<br>
switched domain server through the called terminal, and the packet-switched domain server<br>
may perform the operation of forwarding according to the forwarding target specified by the<br>
called terminal device.<br>
III.	The circuit switching server fails to receive a temporary response message, for the<br>
call request, returned by the called terminal device through the circuit-switched domain<br>
adapter in a preset period, that is, the circuit switching server can not communicate with the<br>
called terminal device.<br>
 <br>
IV. The circuit switching server fails to receive a reply message, for accepting the call,<br>
returned by the called terminal device through the circuit-switched domain adapter in a preset<br>
period.<br>
Four trigger conditions for call forwarding are provided above. It would be<br>
appreciated that the trigger conditions for call forwarding may be appropriately set according<br>
to specific circumstances and service implementations, and the present invention is not<br>
limited by specific trigger conditions.<br>
The seventh embodiment of the present invention realizes that a packet-switched<br>
network platform provides a forwarding service for the circuit-switched network called<br>
terminal device. During the process of evolving from the circuit-switched network to the<br>
packet-switched network, network building costs are reduced and network resources are<br>
saved through centrally controlling the forwarding service by the packet-switched network.<br>

Detail description has been given above with respect to the call control method,<br>
circuit-switched domain adapter and terminal device proposed by the embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The embodiments of the present invention realize a call control to a circuit- switched<br>
terminal device by a packet-switched control platform through establishing a circuit-switched<br>
call leg between the terminal device and a circuit-switched domain adapter, and establishing a<br>
packet-switched call connection between the circuit-switched domain adapter, which operates<br>
as a proxy of the terminal device, and a second party under the control of a packet-switched<br>
domain server. Call control functions of a circuit-switched network are abandoned and a call<br>
control service is provided for the circuit-switched domain terminal device by the packet-<br>
switched domain server, thus centralizing control functions of the whole network, reducing<br>
network operation costs and making introduction of new services easier.<br>
Further, the present invention realizes that a packet-switched network service<br>
platform provides supplementary services, such as call hold, call waiting and call transfer, for<br>
a circuit-switched network terminal device. Through reusing a circuit-switched call leg<br>
between a circuit-switched domain adapter and the terminal device, the implementation of a<br>
second call connection becomes easier, thus saving CS network resources and decreasing the<br>
establishing time of a call connection.<br>
Meanwhile, the embodiments of the present invention realize that a packet-switched<br>
network platform provides a forwarding service for a circuit-switched network called<br>
terminal device. During the process of evolving from a circuit-switched network to a packet-<br>
switched network, network building costs and network resources are saved through centrally<br>
controlling the forwarding service by the packet-switched network.<br>
The principle and implementations of the present invention are set forth with<br>
reference to specific examples. The description of the above embodiments is only for<br>
facilitating to understand the methods and gist of the present invention. Meanwhile, for those<br>
skilled in the art, modifications in specific implementations and application scopes are<br>
possible in light of the principle of the present invention. In summary, the description should<br>
not be construed as limiting the present invention.<br>
