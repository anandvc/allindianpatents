				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of stillbene-disulphonic acids containing bis-alkoxytriazinyl-amino, or derivatives thereof.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of stilbene-disulphonic acids containing bis-alkoxy-triazinyl-amino, or derivatives thereof, and to their use as optical brighteners for organic material, chiefly for paper and cellulose, in particular for photographic paper.<br>
Optical brighteners based on substituted bis-triazinylamino-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acids in which in each case each triazine radical is substituted by an alkoxy radical, in addition to the substitution by the flavonic acid and a further amine, and a process for their preparation are known in large numbers.<br>
The alkoxy radical is usually introduced only in the first or in the second stage in the presence of an acid-binding agent. Thus, an alkanol is reacted with cyanuric chloride or with a cyanuric chloride derivative which still contains two chlorine atoms. Considerable undesirable side reactions due to multiple reactions on the cyanuric chloride occur here. Introduction of an alkoxy group in the third stage, i.e. into a cyanuric chloride derivative which still contains only one chlorine atom, requires special conditions, such as, for example, working in anhydrous glycols or glycol monoalkyl ethers in the presence of the corresponding sodium alcoholate (DE-A 1 444 015).<br>
In JP-A 305 983, bis-triazinylamino-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid derivatives are reacted with methanol in a ratio of 1:2 or with a slight excess of methanol.<br>
DE-A-2 335 570 reports that if glycols or glycol monoalkyl ethers are used, it is possible to react these with bis-triazinylamino-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid derivatives, i.e. with a cyanuric chloride derivative which still carries only one chlorine atom on each triazine ring, in the third stage. However, the yield of this procedure is only between 50 and 80% and therefore makes the process unattractive. There was thus a need for a process with which exactly one C1-C4-alkoxy radical per cyanuric chloride<br><br>
unit can be incorporated selectively and with improved yields into bis-triazinylamino-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acids without the use of sophisticated and expensive reagents.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of stillbene-disulphonic acids containing bis-alkoxytriazinyl-amino of formula (I) as herein described, or derivatives thereof, characterized in that a stilbene-disulphonic acid containing bis-chloro triazinyl-amino, or a derivative thereof, is reacted with a C1-C4-monoalkanol, at least 10 mold of C1-C4 mono alkanol being employed per mol of the stillbene-sulphide acid containing bis-chlorotriazmyl-arnino of formula (II) as herein described, or derivatives thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, at least 20 mol of the C1-C4-monoalkanol are employed per mol of a stilbene-disulphonic acid containing bis-chloro-triazinyl-amino, or derivatives thereof. Particularly preferably, 50 - 500 mol, in particular 100 - 300 mol, of C1-C4-monoalkanol are employed per mol of stilbene-sulphonic acid compound containing bis-chloro-triazinyl-amino.<br>

Methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol or tert-butanol, in particular methanol, are employed as preferred C1-C4-monoalkanols.<br>
The process for the preparation of 4,4'-bis[6-alkoxy-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl-amino]stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid, or derivatives thereof, in which the triazinyl radicals are in each case substituted with amine radicals in the 4-position, is particularly preferred.<br>

The acid-binding agent is preferably employed in an amount of 2 to 6 molar equivalents per mol of the stilbene-disulphonic acid containing bis-chloro-triazinyl-amino, or derivatives thereof,<br>

Example 1<br>
1,000 g of methanol which comprises 10% of water are initially introduced into the reaction vessel. 185 g of 10% strength sodium hydroxide solution are then added. The temperature is brought to 35°C. A solution, heated to about 35°C, of 167 g of 4,4'-bis[(4-(2,5-disulpho)anilino-6-chloro-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]-stilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid hexasodium salt in 1275 ml of water is then added dropwise at 35°C in the course of 1 hour. The temperature is maintained for 2 hours.<br>
Directly after the reaction, the pH is brought to 6.5 to 7.0 in the course of about 1 hour by addition of 1 0% strength hydrochloric acid. Thereafter, methanol or methanol/water is distilled off until a constant boiling point of 100°C is reached. The batch is topped up to 1500 ml with water at about 30°C.<br>
The solution is then filtered with suction, first over a blue band filter and then over a 0.8 urn filter, in order to free the solution from all the sediments and suspended substances which impede the permeate flow. The 1500 ml are introduced into a pressure permeation unit. The first 500 ml of permeate are removed at 40 to 50°C under about 40 bar. 500 ml of water are added and the second approximately 500 ml of permeate are removed. 500 ml of water are added and the third approximately 500 ml of permeate are removed. 500 ml of water are added and the fourth approximately 500 ml of permeate are removed.

chlorotriazinyl-amino of formula (II) as herein described, or derivatives<br>
thereof.<br>
2.	Process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein at least 20 mol of C1-C4-<br>
monoalkanol  are   employed   per   mol   of the   stillbene-sulphonic  acid<br>
containing bis-chloro-triazinyl-amino, or derivatives thereof.<br>
3.	Process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein   methanol is used as the<br>
C1-C4-monoalkanol.<br>

M	represents hydrogen, an alkali metal ion or an optionally<br>
substituted ammonium ion,<br>
R1and R2     independently of one another represent C1-C4-alkyl and R3and R4     independently of one another represent an amine radical, and is prepared starting from compounds of the formula (II)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3, R4 and M have the abovementioned meaning.<br>
6.	Process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the stilbene-disulphonic<br>
acid containing bis-alkoxy-triazinyl-amins or derivatives thereof are used<br>
for optical brightening of organic materials, in particular of cellulose and<br>
paper.<br>
7.	Process    for    the    preparation    of    stillbene-disulphonic    acids<br>
