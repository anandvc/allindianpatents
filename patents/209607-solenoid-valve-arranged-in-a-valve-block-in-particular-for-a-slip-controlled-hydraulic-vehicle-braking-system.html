The invention relates to a solenoid valve arranged in a valve block, in particular for a slip-controlled, hydraulic vehicle braking system.<br>
A solenoid valve of this type, in which a hydraulic part of the solenoid valve is held in a bore of a valve block, is already known (DE 198 07 130 Al). Fitted onto the hydraulic part protruding out of the valve block is an electrical part of the solenoid valve.<br>
The hydraulic part of the solenoid valve has an armature guide sleeve, which is widened on the valve block side with an annular step for the fluid-tight holding of a multi-part valve body with a valve seat of a seat valve. Pushed onto the armature guide sleeve is a fastening bush. This fits around the armature guide sleeve over the annular step, the annular step itself and a widened sleeve portion following the latter, to be precise around the latter with a fluid-tight press fit. Furthermore, the fastening bush is caulked in the region of the mouth of the armature guide sleeve with the latter, which means that increased effort is involved in assembly. The hydraulic part, completed with an armature, a restoring spring, a pole core and a filter disc, is supported by the fastening bush on a step of the bore of the valve block. Outer circumferential caulking of the fastening bush on the valve block serves for fastening and sealing the hydraulic part in the fluid-carrying bore.<br>
Furthermore, it is known from DE 197 10 353 Al to equip the hydraulic part of a solenoid valve with a pot-shaped valve sleeve, which is provided on the bottom side with a valve seat of a seat valve produced by a non-cutting operation. The valve sleeve engages in a fluid-tight manner in a portion of the bore of a valve block with a circumferential press fit and separates fluid-carrying channels, the clearance of which can be switched by the seat valve. An additional sealing element is consequently superfluous.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
rhe solenoid valve according to the invention with the features as described herein has the advantage over the aforementioned state of development that a fluid-tight<br><br>
connection is established between the guide sleeve and the fastening bush at the same lime as the bush is pushed onto the sleeve for creating the press fit, by the edge of the fastening bush undergoing a forming operation when it meets the fillet of the guide sleeve, with the result that the guide sleeve and fastening bush come into intimate contact with each other in this zone. In this pressure-forming process, the fillet is the mould and the edge is the plastically deformed workpiece. This configuration achieves the effect of both fastening the bush on the guide sleeve and creating a seal between the two parts in a low-cost way in a single assembly operation.<br>
Advantageous developments and improvements of the solenoid valve are provided by the measures as described herein.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a solenoid valve arranged in a valve block, in particular for a slip-controlled, hydraulic vehicle braking system, comprising: the solenoid valve having a guide sleeve for an armature, the guide sleeve widened with an annular step, which has an end wall extending at least radially from a cylindrical casing wall of the guide sleeve, pushed onto the guide sleeve is a fastening bush, which comes into close fitting contact with the casing wall of the guide sleeve, the end wall of the annular step and with rounded-out fillet between the casing wall and the end wall, the guide sleeve and the fastening bush are held in a bore of the valve block, the fastening bush is connected to the valve block by fluid-tight caulking, characterized in that: the fastening bush acts with a press fit on the casing wall of the guide sleeve, the fastening bush having a peripheral edge which is assigned to the fillet of the guide sleeve and is produced with a rounding-off radius r, which is smaller than a rounding-out radius R of the fillet, when the fastening bush is fitted on the guide sleeve, the rounding-off radius r of the edge adapts itself at least to the rounding-out radius R of the fillet by plastic deforming of the edge on the said fillet.<br>
Drawing<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is represented in a simplified form in the drawing and explained in more detail in the description which follows. Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section of a solenoid valv(<br><br>
arranged on a valve block and Figure 2 shows the portions of components marked by detail X in Figure 1, which are represented separately from one another and are in the state of pre-assembly.<br>
Description of the exemplary embodiment<br>
A solenoid valve 10, reproduced in Figure 1 of the drawing, is arranged on a valve block 11 and forms part of a pressure control device, otherwise not represented, for slip-controlled, hydraulic vehicle braking systems.<br>
The solenoid valve 10, which is closed when there is no current flowing, comprises two subassemblies: a hydraulic part 13, which is partly held in a stepped bore 14 of the valve block 11, and an electrical part 15, which is fitted onto the hydraulic part protruding out of the valve block. The electrical part 15 substantially comprises a coil former 16 with an electrical winding 17, a coil casing 18 conducting the magnetic flux and an annular disc 19 conducting the magnetic flux.<br>
The hydraulic part 13 of the solenoid valve 10 has a guide sleeve 21, which is closed at its end assigned to the electrical part 15 by a pressed-in and fluid-tight welded pole core 22. Held in the guide sleeve 21 is a longitudinally displaceable armature 23. The armature 23 is supported by a restoring spring 24 on the pole core 22. Away from the pole core, the armature 23 is provided with a spherical closing element 25.<br>
The guide sleeve 21 is widened with an annular step 27, which has an end wall 29 extending radially from a cylindrical casing wall 28 of the guide sleeve. In the transitional region between the casing wall 28 and the end wall 29, the guide sleeve 21 is provided with a<br><br>
rounded-out fillet 30, which has a rounding-out radius R (Figure 2) . Away from the pole core, the guide sleeve 21 has a hollow-cylindrical portion 31 of greater diameter, following the annular step 27.<br>
Pressed into the hollow-cylindrical portion 31 of the guide sleeve 21 from its side away from the pole core is a pot-shaped valve sleeve 33. The valve sleeve 33, formed as a deep-drawn part, narrows towards its bottom 34 into a straight cylindrical casing portion 35. At the bottom 34 there is an aperture 36 and also a hollow-conical valve seat 37, on which the closing element 25 of the armature 23 acts in the depicted position of the solenoid valve 10. The closing element 25 and the valve seat 37 form a seat valve 38, by which a fluid-conducting connection between the bottom aperture 36 and an aperture 39 in the casing portion 35 of the valve sleeve 33 can be switched- The valve sleeve 23 [sic] is fastened on the guide sleeve 21 by a flanged connection 40 created at the free end of the hollow-cylindrical portion 31. Furthermore, fitted onto the ho How-cylindrical portion 31 of the guide sleeve 21 is a filter sleeve 41, which reaches over the aperture 39 in the casing of the valve sleeve 33.<br>
Also belonging to the hydraulic part 13 of the solenoid valve 10 is an annular fastening bush 43. This is pushed onto the guide sleeve 21 from the side of the pole core 22. The fastening bush 43 has a peripheral edge 44 which is assigned to the fillet 3 0 of the guide sleeve 21 and is produced with a rounding-off radius r, which is smaller than the rounding-out radius R of the fillet (Figure 2) . In the assembled state (as represented in Figure 1) , the fastening bush 43 comes into close fitting contact with the casing wall 28 and the end wall 29 of the guide sleeve 21. At the same time, the fastening bush 43 acts with a press fit on the  casing  wall  28 ^'^      *"^'=^  '^"•^"i ^^      «i ^^-^ro      91<br><br>
Furthermore; when the edge 44 of the fastening bush 43 meets the fillet 30 of the guide sleeve 21, the rounding-off radius of the edge adapts itself to the rounding-out radius of the fillet by plastic deforming of the edge 44. This presupposes adequate ductility of the fastening bush 43 and dimensional stability of the guide sleeve 21. The press fit of the fastening bush 43 on the casing wall 28 and the plastically deformed edge 44 represents a seal, which is identified in Figure 1 by A,<br>
The hydraulic part 13 of the solenoid valve 10, put together from the aforementioned components (in a different sequence than that described) represents a subassembly which is fitted as follows in the bore 14 of the valve block 11:<br>
The hydraulic part 13 is introduced into the bore 14 with its portion away from the pole core. At the same time, the casing portion 35 of the valve sleeve 33 acts in a portion 47 of the bore 14 following a bore step 46, thereby creating a press fit. This presupposes adequate dimensional stability of the valve sleeve 33, which is formed with a greater wall thickness than the wall thickness of the guide sleeve 21 and is subjected to a heat treatment. The press fit achieves the effect of a seal B between the valve sleeve 33 and the bore portion 47, which separates fluid-carrying channels 48 and 49 of the valve block 11 from each other. The pressing-in process of the hydraulic part 13 into the bore 14 is limited by the fastening bush 43 striking an annular step 51 of the bore 14 on the mouth side. In this position of the hydraulic part 13, the filter sleeve 41 extending as far as the fastening bush 43 acts on the bore step 46. Displacing material of the valve block 11 from the rim of the mouth of the bore 14 achieves the effect of caulking 53, reaching over an offset 52 of the fastening bush 43.   This has the<br><br>
effect of creating a seal C between the fastening bush 43 and the valve block 11. In this way, the hydraulic part 13 of the solenoid valve 10 is protected against the escape of fluid from the bore 14 of the valve block 11 and against bypassing of the seat valve 38, without the use of elastomeric sealing means.<br>
Finally, the solenoid valve 10 is completed by fitting the electrical part 15 onto the portion of the hydraulic part 13 protruding out of the valve block 11.<br><br><br><br><br>
