Induction of the Mitochondria! Permeability Transition<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to modification of mitochondrial membrane permeability in cells and in particular, the identification and use of compounds which selectively induce the MPT in proliferating cells.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Mitochondria provide ATP to support normal cell function and their perturbation leads to apoptotic and necrotic cell death (Crompton, 1999). An important factor in apoptosis and necrosis is the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which occurs as a result of calcium overload. The cause of the MPT is the opening of a non-specific pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, known as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) (Crompton et al., 1987). Oxidative stress, adenine nucleotide depletion and elevated inorganic phosphate greatly increase the sensitivity of the pore to calcium concentration. Opening of the MPTP is accompanied by equilibration of all small solutes (
Adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) is a 30 kD protein that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and is central to the MPTP (Crompton *et al., 1988).<br>
There is a need to selectively induce the MPT, particularly in proliferating cells, as a means of inducing apoptosis.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for identifying compounds which bind to ANT in mitochondria and selectively induce the MPT in proliferating cells relative to non-proliferating or growth quiescent cells.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a process for identifying a compound which induces the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in proliferating cells, wherein the process comprises contacting a cell or cell extract with a compound, determining whether the compound binds to adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and determining whether the compound selectively induces the MPT in proliferating cells.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a process for screening a plurality of compounds to identify a compound which induces MPT in proliferating cells, wherein the process comprises contacting a cell or a cell extract with the plurality of compounds,<br><br>
determining whether any of the compounds bind to ANT, and if so, separately determining for each of the plurality of compounds whether the compound selectively induces the MPT in proliferating cells.<br>
With reference to the first and second aspects of the invention, selective induction of the MPT in proliferating cells may be determined, for example, by comparing the effect of compounds identified as binding to ANT in accordance with the first or second aspect of the invention, on the MPT in proliferating cells with the effect on the MPT in non-proliferating or growth quiescent cells.<br>
Also with reference to the first and second aspects of the invention, in one embodiment the process may involve measuring changes in the cellular concentration of the superoxide {Or} anion. In another embodiment, the process may involve measuring changes in Cytochrome C release.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a process for identifying a compound which induces apoptosis in proliferating cells, the process comprising contacting a cell or cell extract with a candidate compound, determining whether there is an increase in cellular superoxide anion (O2*) concentration, and determining whether the compound selectively induces apoptosis in proliferating cells.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a process for identifying a compound which is an inhibitor of angiogenesis, the process comprising contacting a cell or cell extract with a candidate compound, determining whether there is an increase in cellular superoxide anion (O2-) concentration, and determining whether the compound is an inhibitor of angiogenesis.<br>
According to a fifth aspect of the invention there is provided a method of inducing MPT in a vertebrate, wherein the method comprises administering to the vertebrate a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound detected in accordance with the process of any one of the first to third aspects of the invention, or a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant and/or diluent<br>

In another embodiment, an arsenoxide compound identified in accordance with the present invention is selected from the following compounds:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compound "GSAO" (4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino)-phenylarsenoxide) has been 5     previously described in International patent application WO 01/21628, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by cross-reference.<br>
Other compounds which may interact with ANT include compounds according to Formula (V) illustrated below: <br>
10	wherein Q is any halogen.<br>
Another form of an arsenoxide compound which may interact with ANT is a compound according to Formula (Vi): <br>
wherein G is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, amino, is     nitro, cyano, carboxy, C1-C5 alkoxy, C1-C5 alkyl and C6-C12 aryl and -NHC(O)CH2Q, wherein Q is halogen, -OS(O)2CH3l -OS(O)2CeH$ or-OS(O)2-p tolyl.<br><br>
Typically, G is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, hydroxy, amino, nitro, carboxy, C1-C5 alkoxy, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, phenyl, and -NHC(O)CH2Q, wherein Q is the group consisting of halogen, -OS(O)2CH3, -OS(O)2CeH5 and -OS(O)2-p tolyi.<br>
In one embodiment, in a compound of Formula VI, G is hydroxy, fluorine, amino, or nitro.<br>
in another embodiment, group G is in an ortho-, meta-, or para- relationship to the arsenoxide group. For example, in another embodiment G is in an ortho- or para- relationship to the arsenoxide group.<br>
Typically the activity of the arsenic atom may be modified by the group G, when G and the arsenic atom are in an ortho or para relationship to one another. For example, when G is an electron donating group such as OH (ionised to 0- at physiological pH), the arsenic atom may be deactivated towards dithiols and may become more selective, for example, only reacting with very reactive dithiols. Alternatively, when G is an electron withdrawing group, such as NOa, electron density may be drawn away from the arsenic atom, making it rrore reactive to dithiols. Selective inhibition of some redox proteins and not others may be achieved by manipulation of G.<br>
Typically, in the arsenoxide compounds capable of interacting with ANT, the arsenoxide group (-As=O) may be replaced by an arsenoxide equivalent.<br>
An arsenoxide equivalent is defined herein as any dithiol reactive species that shows essentially the same affinity towards dithiols as -As=0. Typically, arsenoxide equivalent includes dithiol reactive entities, such as"As, Ge, Sn and Sb species. More typically an arsenoxide equivalent can be represented by -D(Zi)(Z2). Arsenoxide equivalents are expected to exhibit identical or substantially identical activity to that of the corresponding arsenoxide.<br>
Typically, for arsenoxide equivalents of the form -D(Zi)(Z2), D will be, for example, As, RSn, Sb, or RGe, and Z1 and Z2 will be labile groups (i.e. groups easily displaced under physiological conditions). Z1 and Z2, may be identical or different and may either be connected or independent from each other (bound only to the arsenic atom).<br>
Suitable arsenoxide equivalents include the following:<br><br>
wherein Z\ and Z2 are selected from the group consisting of OH, C1-C10 alkoxy, C6-C10 aryloxy, C1-C10 alkylthio, C6-C10 arylthio, C1-C10 alkylseleno, C6-C10 arylseleno, F, Cl, Br and I;<br><br><br>
wherein Ei = E2 = 0, E1 =0 and E2 = S or E1 = E2 = S; M is Rf" and Rfl" are independently selected from the group consisting or hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C5-C12 aryl, halogen, C1-C10 alkoxy, C6-C10 aryloxy, hydroxy and carboxy; and n = 1 to 10.<br>
For arsenoxide equivalents of the form D(Zi)(Z2), when D is As and Z1 and Z2 are OH, the arsenoxide equivalent may be in equilibrium with polymeric species, as depicted below.<br><br>
In respect of the equilibrium depicted above, arsenic is one of many elements whose hydroxy species exist in equilibrium with the corresponding polymeric anhydrides (Doak &amp; Freedman, 1970). Therefore, arsenoxide compounds may actually exist as low or medium molecular weight polymers (eg n = 3 to 6). However, the dehydration reaction is reversible, and therefore soluble polymeric anhydrides are expected to behave as arsenoxide equivalents, that is, they are expected to bind to closely spaced dithiols in substantially the same way as the monomeric -As(OH)2 species. <br>
wherein X3=NH, Yi=O; X3=Yi=O or X3=S, Yi=O, and R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C6-C12 aryl, and carboxy, or is one of the twenty amino acid side chains; <br><br>
wherein X3=Yi=0; X3=NH, Yi=O: X3=S, Yi=O; X3=Yi=NH; or X3=S, Yi=NH; or X3=S, Yi=NH and Rn to R14 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C6-C12 aryl, and CO2H; <br>
wherein X3=Yi=O, or X3=NH, Yi=O; and Rn to R14 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C10 alkyl, C6-C12 aryl, halogen, Ci»Cio alkoxy, and CO2H. Typically, (XBX')B' is as defined above.<br>

No treatment (•) is shown for comparison. C increasing Ca2+concentration sensitises the MPTP to GSAO. Mitochondria were incubated with 50 (•), 75 (o), 100 (■) or 200 \M (□) GSAO in the absence or presence of increasing Ca2* concentration and the time for half-maximal swelling was measured. D Labelling of ANT with GSAO-B. Isolated rat mitochondria were labelled with GSAO-B in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of a 4-fold molar excess of 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (DMP) and the biotin-labelled proteins were collected on streptavidin-agarose beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for ANT. E GSAO competed for alkylation of Cys160 in ANT by eosine-maleimide. Rat sub-mitochondrial particles were labelled with eosin-5-maleimide in the absence (lane 1) or presence (lane 2) of GSAO and the eosin-labelied ANT was resolved on SDS-PAGE and detected bytransillumination.<br>

GSAO triggered mitochondria! depolarisation and apootosis in proliferatinq, but not growth-quiescent endothelial cells. A GSAO reduced the viability of proliferating, but not growth-quiescent, endothelial cells. In contrast, PAO was equally toxic to both types of cell. BAE ceils were arrested for 24 h in medium containing 0.25% serum, then cultured for a further 48 h in medium containing 0.25% or 10% serum, with GSAO (i) or PAO (ii). Number of attached cells after 48 h treatment was measured. Results are mean ± SE of three experiments. B GSAO triggered mitochondria! depolarisation and induced apoptosis in BAE cells. Cells were cultured for 48 h in medium containing 10% serum and GSAO and then labelled with JC-1 or annexin V. The percent of cells positive for mitochondria! membrane depolarisation (JC-1 green/red fluorescence) and induction of apoptosis (annexin V binding) was measured. The same result was observed in two different experiments.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The present invention relates to processes for identifying compounds which bind to ANT in mitochondria and selectively induce the MPT in proliferating cells, relative to non-proliferating cells.<br>
ANT is a 30 kD protein that spans the inner mitochondrial membrane and is central to the MPTP (Crompton et al., 1988), There are three unpaired cysteines on the matrix side of ANT - Cys57, Cys160 and Cys257. (Halestrap et ah, 1997). ANT activity is controlled by the binding of Ca2+, cyclophilin D and adenine nucleotides. Cyclophilin D (Crompton et al., 1988) and adenine nucleotides (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a,b; Haworth &amp; Hunter, 2000) bind to the matrix side of ANT, while the site(s) for interaction of Ca2+ has yet to be determined. There are several known regulators of the MPTP that appear to act by modulating binding of these three compounds. The primary trigger for opening of the MPTP is a rise in matrix Ca2+ concentration. Chelation of Ca2* with EGTA blocks pore opening. The specificity of the trigger site (presumably on ANT) for Ca2+ appears to be absolute as other divalent metal ions such as Mg2* act as inhibitors (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a). Binding of cyclophilin D to ANT is necessary for pore opening at sub-miliimoiar Ca2+ concentrations (Halestrap et a)., 2002). Cyciosporin A (CsA) blocks pore opening by binding to cyclophilin D and displacing it from ANT (Crompton et alM 1988). Matrix ADP is also an important modulator of pore opening that binds to ANT and decreases the sensitivity of the trigger site to Ca2* (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a,b). Bonkrekic acid (BKA) also interacts with ANT and decreases sensitivity to Ca2+ (Hunter &amp; Haworth, 1979).<br>
Generally, the process for identifying a compound which induces the MPT in proliferating cells in accordance with the invention comprises contacting a cell or cell extract with a candidate compound, determining whether the compound binds to ANT, and then determining whether the compound selectively induces the MPT in proliferating cells. Assessing whether a compound selectively induces the MPT in proliferating cells may be determined by comparing the effect of a compound identified as binding to ANT on the MPT in proliferating cells with the effect of the compound on the MPT in non-proliferating or growth quiescent cells.<br><br>
Monitoring induction of MPT can be done using standard techniques known to those in the art. For example, spectrophotometrically monitoring the change in light scattering at a given wavelength, for differing concentrations of compound. A suitable wavelength is typically 520nm.<br>
Detecting the uptake of a compound into the mitochondria of a cell can be carried out using standard techniques. For example, fluorescent labelled compounds can be used or a fluorophore can be attached to a compound. Examples of suitable fluorophores include fluorescein and Cy™5.5. Sub-cellular localisation of compounds can be detected by standard techniques including confocal fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, compounds can be attached to other detectable groups, eg biotin, and detected by staining with streptavidin, such as Streptavidin-AIexa Fluor 488.<br>
Mitochondria! transmembrane potential can be assessed using standard techniques, including, for example, dyes, such as JC-1, and stains, such as annexin V-FITC. By such techniques it is possible to determine whether cells have undergone the MPT and assess whether apoptosis has been induced.<br>
Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide anion (02-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are generated as a by-product of ATP production and play an important role as signalling intermediates in cellular proliferation, but at elevated concentrations they arrest proliferation and induce apoptosis by damaging lipids, proteins, DNA, and RNA (Zanetti et al., 2001). Or is converted in the mitochondria to H2O2 by Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD), but can also be released from mitochondria through anion channels, where it is dismuted to H2O2 by cytosolic Cu/Zn SOD (Vanden Hoek et al., 1998).<br>
There is also disclosed herein a process for identifying a compound which may be capable of inducing apoptosis in proliferating cells, wherein the process comprises contacting a ceil or cell extract with a candidate compound, determining whether there is an increase in cellular superoxide anion (O2-) concentration, and then determining whether the compound selectively induces apoptosis in proliferating cells relative to non-proliferating or growth quiescent cells. Assessing whether a compound selectively induces apoptosis in proliferating cells can be readily determined by those skilled in the art by comparing the effect of the compound on cellular superoxide anion levels in proliferating cells with the effect in non-proliferating or prowth quiescent cells. Measurement of cellular superoxide levels can be carried out using assays well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Release of Cytochrome C from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria is also a known trigger of apoptosis in cells. Measuring changes in levels of Cytochrome C in proliferating cells (relative to non-proliferating cells), may be useful for identifying compounds which perturb mitochondria! function.<br><br>
Also disclosed herein is a process for identifying a compound which may be an inhibitor of angiogenesis, wherein the process comprises contacting a cell or cell extract with a candidate compound, determining- whether there is an increase in cellular superoxide anion (O2-) concentrator), and thereby determining ■ whether the compound may be ah inhibitor of angiogenesis.<br>
Angiogenesis refers to the sprouting of new capillaries from existing vessels and is driven by proliferating endothelial cells. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis and in the adult (Carmeliet &amp; Jain, 2001). In the normal adult mammal angiogenesis is confined to the female reproductive cycles, wound healing and several pathological situations. Angiogenesis is a key factor in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy and cancer. Tumour expansion and metastasis is dependent on tumour angiogenesis (Hanahan &amp; Folkman, 1996). Therapeutic Applications<br>
' Perturbation of the MPT by compounds which bind to ANT may induce apoptosis. Reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anion (Or) play an important role as signalling intermediates in cellular proliferation, however elevated concentrations can arrest proliferation and induce apoptosis. Accordingly, compounds which bind to ANT and selectively inhibit mitochondrial function, or compounds which increase cellular levels of superoxide anion in proliferating cells compared to non-proliferating cells, may have the potential to be therapeutically useful for treating various diseases and conditions in vertebrates,<br>
Further, release of Cytochrome C from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria is a known trigger of apoptosis in cells. Cytochrome C is thought to directly facilitate activation of caspases. Accordingly, compounds which perturb mitochondrial function (eg, by binding to ANT and inducing the MPT) can result in increased cellular levels of Cytochrome C in proliferating cells (relative to non-proliferating cells), and may have the potential to be therapeutically useful for treating various diseases and conditions in vertebrates.<br>

Example 1 Synthesis of Compounds<br>
Methods Synthesis of GSAA<br>
BRAA was prepared by a modification of the method described in Donoghue et al (2000) and WO 01/21628. p-Arsanilic acid (20.6 g, 95 mmol) was added in portions to a solution of sodium carbonate (20 g, 189 mmol) in water (200 mL). When all solids had dissolved, the solution was found to be pH 10, and was chilled at 4°C for 2 hours. Bromoacetyl bromide (15 mL, 173 mmoi) in dry dichloromethane (35 mL) was added in two portions, each addition followed by vigorous shaking for 2 to 3 min. The mixture was allowed to stand for a few minutes, and the lower organic layer was drained off. 4-(N-(Bromoacetyl)amino)benzenearsonic acid (BRAA) was precipitated by acidification of the solution to about pH 2-3 with the dropwise addition of 98% sulfuric acid, collected by vacuum filtration, and dried, giving BRAA as a white solid.<br>
BRAA (3.38 g, 10 mmol), reduced glutathione (3.23 g, 10.5 mmol) and sodium bicarbonate (3.15 g, 37.5 mmol) were mixed together, and the solid mixture was dissolved in portions in 0,5 M bicarbonate buffer (100 mL). The clear solution was found to be pH 9, and was thoroughly mixed and left overnight at room temperature. On the following day, the solution was acidified to neutral pH with the dropwise addition of 32% hydrochloric acid, and the product precipitated from absolute ethanol (1 L) by dropwise addition of the acidified solution to the well-stirred alcohol. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, and then left for 3 hours until the precipitate had settled. The clear ethanolic solution was decanted until -300 mL were left, and then this was swirled and centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min. The product 4-(A/-{(S-glutathionyl)acetyl)amino)-benzenearsonic acid (GSAA) was washed by re-suspension in fresh absolute ethanol and centrifuged again. The washing was repeated two more times, and the final suspension was dried to a white solid, GSAA, by rotary evaporation. The GSAA was characterised by 1H-NMR (D2O, 300 MHz) and 13C-NMR (D20,75 MHz) and has a molecular weight of 564.<br>
Synthesis of GSAO<br><br>
The complete synthesis of GSAO is described in International patent application WO 01/21628, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by cross-reference. BRAA was prepared as described above. BRAA was then converted to 4-(/V-(bromoacety!)amino)-benzenearsonous acid (BRAO) using the method described in Donoghue et al (2000). The procedure for the conversion of BRAO to GSAO is a modification of that described in Donoghue et a). (2000), as follows- Reduced glutathione (16 g, 52 mmol) was dissolved in deoxygenated water (1 L) under a nitrogen atmosphere (deoxygenated water was prepared by boiling followed by cooling to room temperature, all the time under an atmosphere of nitrogen). BRAO (25 g, 77 mmol) was suspended in the solution, and vigorous stirring of the mixture was applied until the undissolved BRAO had lost ail tendency to float, at which point the rate of stirring was decreased. Triethylamine (16 mL, 11.6 g, 115 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for at least 18 hours, all the time under nitrogen. Some colourless solid was removed by rapid vacuum filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated to a viscous gel on a rotary evaporator. The gel was diluted with ethanol (250 mL), the rate of stirring was increased, and then acetone (250 mL) was added, with formation of a white solid. After stirring for 2 hours under nitrogen, the solid was collected by vacuum filtration, and dried at room temperature under vacuum to a constant weight. Analysis of the material by 1H-NMR allowed the amount of triethylamine to be determined. An equivalent amount of sodium hydroxide (ie. 1 mmol NaOH per mmol triethylamine) was added in the form of a 10 M aqueous solution to a solution of the material in the minimum amount of deoxygenated water. The solution was stirred under nitrogen for 2 hours/and GSAO (as the sodium salt) was obtained by removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator. The GSAO was characterised by the following methods: 'H-NMR (D2O( 400 MHz), 13C-NMR (D2O, 100 MHz), HPLC, and infrared spectroscopy (nujol mull). The elemental analysis was consistent with a composition of GSAO.2H2O, and the mass spectrum gave the parent molecular ion at 549.1 m.u. [GSAO+H]+. The purity of GSAO was &gt; 94% by HPLC.<br>
Synthesis of GSCA<br>
GSCA was prepared in a similar manner to GSAA, using 4-aminobenzoic acid instead of p-arsanilic acid as follows. A chilled alkaline solution of 4-aminobenzoic acid (13 g, 95 mmol) was prepared as described above for p-arsanilic acid, and reacted in an identical manner with bromoacetyl bromide. The lower organic layer was drained off, and 4-(/V-(bromoacetyi)amino)-benzoic acid (BRCA) precipitated directly from solution by itself. Following the rest of the procedure for GSAA exactly using BRCA (2.58 g, 10 mmol) in place of BRAA gave GSCA. as a<br><br>
white solid after rotary evaporation. The GSCA was characterised by 1H-NMR (D2O, 300 MHz) and 13C-NMR (D2O, 75 MHz) and the disodium salt has a molecular weight of 528,<br>
Synthesis of biotin and fluorescein derivatives of GSAO and GSAA<br>
GSAO-B was produced as described by Donoghue et al. (2000) and has a molecular weight of 1001. A solution of fluorescein-5-EX succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (2.4 mg, 4.1 (jmol) in DMSO (240 \xL) was added to GSAO or GSAA (33.8 mM) in Mes buffer, pH 5.5 (5 mM, 473 pL), the mixture was diluted with bicarbonate buffer, pH 9 (0.5 M, 3.287 mL) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 80 min. The reaction was then diluted with glycine (100 mM) in PBS (4 mL), and allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The final solution contained trivalent arsenical (2.00 mM) and glycine (50 mM). The molar ratio of fluorescein-5X to GSAO or GSAA was -1.5:1. The molecular weights of GSAO- and GSAA-fluorescein (GSAO-F and GSAA-F) are 1024 and 1040, respectively.<br>

The solution was cooled in ice for 30 min then added to a 250 mL separating funnel. A solution of bromoacetyl bromide (4 mL, 46.0 mmol) in CH2CI2 (20 mL) was added cautiously to the separating funnel over approximately 30 mins with frequent shaking and release of CO2 (g). After CO2 evolution had ceased, the CH2CI2 was separated and the aqueous layer was acidified with cone. H2SO4. A white precipitate resulted which was collected by filtration (6 g, 82% yield).<br>
Synthesis of2'(2'Bromoacetyl'0-amino)benzenearsonou$ acid<br>
2-(2-Bromoacetylamino)benzenearsonic acid (6g, 17.8 mmoi) was dissolved in HBr/MeOH (1:1). Nai (80 mg) was added and the reaction was purged with N2 and cooled to O^C. SO2 was bubbled through at ca. 4 bubbles/second and after 15 min a white precipitate started to form. SO2 was bubbled through for a further 2.5 h as the reaction was warmed to room temperature. The reaction was purged with N2 for 10 min, and the solid was collected by filtration washing with H2O (x3), ether (x2) to give 1.35g of 2-(2-bromoacetylamino)benzenearsonous acid.

The solution was cooled in ice for 30 min then added to a 500 mL separating funnel. A solution of bromoacetyl bromide (16 mL, 184 mmol) in CH2CI2 (60 mL) was added cautiously to the separating funnel with frequent shaking and release of CO2 (g). Addition took about 2 h. After CO2 (g) evolution had ceased, the CH2CI2 was separated and the aqueous layer was acidified with 98% H2SO4.

Methods<br>
Mitochondria swelling assay<br>
Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of ~250g male Wistar rats using differential centrifugation as described previously (Schnaitman &amp; Greenawalt, 1968). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 3 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0 buffer containing 213 mM mannitol, 71 mM sucrose and 10 mM sodium succinate at a concentration of 30 mg of protein per mL MPT induction was assessed spectrophotometrically by suspending the liver mitochondria at 0.5 mg of protein per mL at 25°C in 3 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0 buffer containing 75 mM mannitol, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM sodium succinate, and 2 juM rotenone. AH buffer components were from Sigma, St. Louis, MO. The arsenical derivatives and GSCA were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 mM glycine. ANT-binding compounds employed were CsAf BKA and ADP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Reagent concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. Swelling was measured by monitoring the associated decrease in light scattering at 520 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermomax Plus (Palo Alto, CA) microplate reader<br>
Binding of GSAO to ANT<br>
Rat liver mitochondria were suspended at 1 mg of protein per mL 3t 25°C in 3 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0 buffer containing 213 mM mannitol, 71 mM sucrose and 10 mM sodium succinate and incubated with 100 jaM GSAO-B in absence or presence of 400 ^M 2,3-dimercaptopropanol (Fluka, Buchs, SG, Switzerland) at room temperature on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The labelled mitochondria were washed three times with PBS and sonicated in 0.3 mL of ice-cold 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4 buffer containing 140 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 0.5% Triton X-100,0.05% Tween-20,10 |iM leupeptin, 10 [M aprotinin, 50 jig.mL"1 4,2-(aminoethy!)-benzene suffonyl fluoride and 5 mM EDTA. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18000g for 10 min at 4°C and incubated with 30 HL of streptavidin-dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) for 60 min at 4°C on a rotating wheel to isolate the biotin-labelled proteins. The beads were washed 5 times with sonication buffer and the biotin-labeiled proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 30 jut! of SDS-Laemmli buffer for 2 minutes. Samples were resolved on 8-16% gradient iGels under reducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membrane. Proteins were detected by Western blot using a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-human ANT polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) -and<br><br>
1:2000 dilution  of rabbit anti-goat peroxidase-conjugated  antibodies  (Dako,  Carpinteria, California).<br>
Labelling of ANT with eosin-5-maleimide<br>
Rat liver sub-mitochondrial particles were prepared by sonication and differential centrifugation according to Majima et al. (1998). The particles were suspended at 20 mg of protein per mL in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.2 buffer containing 250 mM sucrose and 0.2 mM EDTA and incubated without or with 200 nmol GSAO per mg of protein for 10 min at 25°C, followed by 20 nmol of eosin-5-maleimide per mg of protein for 1 min at 0°C in the dark. The labelling was terminated by addition of 10 nmol of dithiothreitol per mg of protein. The proteins were resolved on 4-20% gradient iGels and the eosin-labelled ANT was visualised by UV transillumination using a Fiuor-S™ Multilrnager (Bio-Racl, Hercules, CA).<br>
Results<br>
GSAO (Fig. 1A) triggered swelling of isolated rat liver mitochondria (Fig. 1Bi). The rate of swelling increased with increasing GSAO concentration and time of incubation. The bivalent arsenical moiety of GSAO was responsible for this activity as the corresponding pentavalent arsenical (4-(A/-((S-giutathionyl)acetyl)amino)benzenearsonic acid, GSAA) or carboxylic acid (4-(A/-((S-glutathionyl)acetyl)amino)benzoic acid, GSCA) compounds (Fig. 1A) were without effect (Fig. 1Bii). Positive controls for pore opening were Ca2+and Pi ions (Fig. 1Bi) and PAO (Fig. 1Bii).<br>
ANT activity is controlled by the binding of Ca2+, cyclophilin D and adenine nucleotides. Cycfophilin D (Crompton et al., 1988) and adenine nucleotides (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a,b) bind to the matrix side of ANT, while the site(s) for interaction of Ca2+ has yet to be determined. The primary trigger for opening of the MPTP is a rise in matrix Ca2+ concentration. Chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA blocks pore opening. The specificity of the trigger site for Ca2+ appears to be absolute as other divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ act as inhibitors (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a). Binding of cyclophilin D to ANT is necessary for pore opening at sub-millimolar Ca2+ concentrations (Halestrap et al., 2002). Cyclosporin A (CsA) blocks pore opening by binding to cyclophilin D and displacing it from ANT (Crompton et al., 1988). Matrix ADP is also an important modulator of pore opening that binds to ANT and decreases the sensitivity of the trigger site to Ca2+ (Haworth &amp; Hunter, 1979a,b). Bonkrekic acid (BKA) also interacts with ANT and decreases sensitivity to Ca2+ (Hunter &amp; Haworth, 1979).<br><br>
Mg2+, EGTA, CsA, ADP, and BKA all blocked the effect of GSAO on pore opening (Fig. 1Biii). These observations are consistent with a specific effect of GSAO on pore opening and support ANT as its target.<br>
The half-time for GSAO mediated swelling of the mitochondria was reduced by added Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). This result is consistent with GSAO cross-linking two of the three cysteine residues on ANT that protrude into the mitochondria! matrix.<br>
Direct interaction of ANT with a biotin-tagged GSAO (4-(W-(S-(iV-(6-((6-((biotinoyl)amino)hexanoyl)amino)hexanoyl)-glutathionyl)ace^yl)amino) phenyiarsenoxide, GSAO-B) is shown in Fig. 1D. The labeling of ANT with GSAO-B was specific as it was competed for by a 4-fold molar excess of the small synthetic dithiol, dimercaptoprapanol. Eosine-maieimide alkylates Cys16° in ANT (Majima et al., 1998) and blocks ADP binding (Halestrap et al., 1997). GSAO competed for eosine-maieimide aikylation of ANT Cys160 (Fig. 1E), which implied that GSAO cross-links Cys160 and Cys257.<br>
Example 3<br>
GSAO concentrated in mitochondria in viable cells Methods Cell culture<br>
- Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5 U.mL1 penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD). The human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1 (Ades et al., 1992), was cultured in MCDB131 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 U.mL-1 penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng,mL1 epidermal growth factor (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1 pg.mL:1 hydrocortisone (Sigma). Cell culture plasticwa/e was purchased from Corning Costar (Coming, NY). Trypsin/EDTA solution was from Gibcc.<br>
Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy<br>
BAE cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells per well into 8-well Labtek glass chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were washed once and the medium was replaced with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) (Gibco). The ceils were then incubated for 1 h with 50 pM GSAO-F, 50 JIM GSAO-F and 250 |iM dimercaptopropanol, or 50 jxM GSAA-F. All cells were counterstained with 100 nM Mitotracker™ Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The cells were then washed three times with HBSS, fixed for 10 min with 80% acetone and 20% methanol, and washed three times with HBSS. Slides were mounted in VectaShiefd antifade agent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and sealed with nail<br><br>
polish. Images were captured using a Leica DM IRB inverted microscope and confocal system, with Leica confocal software.<br>
Results<br>
A striking feature of GSAO was that it rapidly localised to mitochondria in viable bovine aortic (BAE) (Fig. 2) and human dermal microvascular (HMEC-1) (data not shown) endotheiiai cells. GSAO was conjugated to fluorescein (GSAO-F) and its sub-cellular localisation was determined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Mitochondria) staining was confirmed by colocalisation of GSAO-F with the red-fluorescent Mitotracker probe, which accumulates in the mitochondria of actively respiring cells (Fig. 2ii, iv and vi). The mitochondria! accumulation of GSAO-F was specific for the dithiol reactivity of GSAO as it was abolished in the presence of a five-fold molar excess of the small synthetic dithiol, dimercaptopropanol (Figure 2iii), and the corresponding pentavalent arsenical, GSAA-F, did not stain the cells (Figure 2v). Mitochondria! localisation was also seen in BAE cells incubated with GSAO-B, followed by staining with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (data not shown).<br>
ANT is abundant in the inner mitochondria! membrane. Sequestration of GSAO on the matrix face of ANT would drive entropic import of GSAO into the matrix. This mechanism is supported by the finding that GSAA, which has effectively the same charge and size as GSAO, did not react with ANT or accumulate in mitochondria.<br>
Example 4<br>
GSAO inhibited ATP production, increased superoxide levels and triggered mitochondria) depolarisation and apoptosis in proliferating, but<br>

Methods ATP assays<br>
BAE cells in six-well culture plates were arrested for 24 h in 0.5% serum or left in 10% serum, then treated for 24 h with 0, 60 or 150 jxM GSAO. The cells were washed once then resuspended in 0.4 mL PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, A 50 §JLI sample of cells was mixed with 50 yL water and 100 yl ATP releasing agent (Sigma) and ATP concentration was measured using a luciferin/luciferase ATP assay mix (Sigma). Light units were converted to ATP concentrations using an ATP standard in place of the 50 JIL water. Cell number was counted using a Beckman Coulter Counter and mol of ATP was expressed per million cells.<br><br>
Cell proliferation assays<br>
BAE or HMEC-1 cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells per ceil into 96 well plates and allowed to adhere overnight and then treated as indicated. For experiments involving arrest of cell proliferation in 0.25% serum, the cells were seeded in medium containing 10% serum, allowed to adhere overnight, then washed with PBS and arrested for 24 h in medium containing 0.25% serum. Attached cells remaining after treatments were measured using methylene blue (Oliver et aL, 1989).<br>
Superoxide, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondria! mass and apoptosis assays<br>
For measurements of superoxide levels with dihydroethidine, mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1, mitochondrial mass with nonyl acridine orange, and apoptosis with annexin V, proliferating or growth-quiescent BAE cells were treated for 24 or 48 h with GSAO in six-well culture plates, then detached with trypsin/EDTA, washed once, and resuspended at 2 x 106 cells per mL in serum-free medium. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with dihydroethidine (5 \M, Molecular Probes) or 30 min at room temperature with JC-1 (0.5 jig.mL-1, Molecular Probes), annexin V-FITC (50 pJ.mL1) (Pharmingen, La Jolla, CA, USA), or acridine orange 10-nonyl bromide (5 jiM, Molecular Probes). Ceils were then washed once, resuspended in 0.5 mL serum-free medium, transferred to ice, and fluorescence was quantitated immediately by flow cytometry.<br>
Results<br>
GSAO concentrated in mitochondria in viable cells and perturbed mitochondrial function and cell viability. Proliferating cells having a greater mitochondrial mass and respiration than growth-quiescent cells. To test whether GSAO might have selective effects on proliferating cells, proliferating or growth-quiescent BAE cells were incubated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of GSAO.<br>
The GSAO ICso for reduction in viability of proliferating BAE cells was -75 \xM (Fig. 3Ai), whereas the compound had little effect on growth-quiescent cells. The control compounds, GSAA and GSCA, had no significant effect on the viability of proliferating BAE cells at concentrations up to 1.0 mM (data not shown). The effect of GSAO on proliferating ceil viability was time-dependent. The GSAO IC5o decreased from -75 pM to -25 jiM when the incubation time increased from 48 to 72 h (data not shown). PAO, in contrast, was equally toxic to both proliferating and growth-quiescent BAE cells'with an IC50 of -200 nM (Fig. 3A(ii)). The same results were observed with HMEC-1 cells (data not shown).   GSAO's effect on proliferating<br><br>
endothetial cell viability was closely associated with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and apoptosis (Fig. 3B). These parameters were measured using the JC-1 dye and FITC-conjugated annexin V, respectively. The ratio of distribution of JC-1 between the cytosol (green fluorescence) and mitochondria (red fluorescence) reflects mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Smiley et al., 1991) while annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of apoptotic cells.<br>
The binding of GSAO to ANT in proliferating endothelial cells affected ATP production. The ATP content of proliferating BAE cells was approximately twice that of growth-quiescent cells and incubation with 150 \M GSAO for 24 h reduced ATP levels in proliferating cells to that of growth-quiescent cells (Fig. 4ai). This result mirrors the selective effects of GSAO on proliferating cell viability (Fig. 4ai). To confirm that the decreased cellular ATP was due to an effect of GSAO on mitochondrial ATP synthesis rather than mitochondria! biogenesis, mitochondrial mass was measured using nonyl acridine orange. This dye binds to cardiolipin in the^ mitochondrial membrane (Petit et al., 1992). The mitochondria! mass of proliferating ceils was approximately twice that of growth-quiescent cells, which was unchanged by GSAO treatment (Fig. 4aii).<br>
At high concentrations, reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anton (02') can arrest cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis. To test the effect of GSAO on cellular levels of Or, BAE cells were treated for 24 h with GSAO and the cellular levels of 02" and H2O2 were measured using the dyes dihydroethidium and CM-H2-DCFDA, respectively. Cellular levels of Or increased linearly with GSAO concentration in proliferating, but not growth-quiescent, BAE cells (Rg. 4b). This effect of GSAO was not due to inhibition of SOD activity as there was only a small decline in H2O2 levels (Fig. 4c). For instance, treatment with 120 yM GSAO for 24 h resulted in a 30% decrease in H2O2, but a 100% increase in the level of Or. This finding was confirmed using two-channel flow cytometric analysis of cellular Or and H2O2 levels. Or levels were increased in the majority of cells without a corresponding decrease in H2O2 (data not shown). In contrast, GSAA had no effect on Or or H2O2 levels. The linear increase in Or levels with GSAO treatment is consistent with a disruptionof mitochondrial integrity.<br>
Example 5 GSAO triggers release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria<br>
To distinguish between the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of GSAO, treated cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to detect late-apoptotic or dead cells. The total number of cells and the proportion of cells that were Pl-positive following 48 h treatment with GSAO were measured by flow cytometry.<br><br>
The [C50 for proliferation arrest of BAE (Fig. 5a) or primary human dermal microvascular endothelial (Fig. 5b) cells was HO pM and -15 pM, respectively. The IC50 for loss of viability was -75 pM and -35 |jM, respectively, indicating that GSAO arrested proliferation at lower concentrations than were necessary to induce apoptosis. The IC50 for proliferation arrest of bovine vascular smooth muscle cells was -30 pM. In contrast, all tumor cells tested were more resistant to GSAO (Figs. 5c-g). The concentrations of GSAO that induce proliferation arrest and loss of viability are 3 to &gt;32-fold and 2 to 9-fold higher, respectively, for tumor ceils than for endothelial cells (Table 1). GSAO treatment caused Lewis lung carcinoma cells to disaggregate, which was the reason for the apparent increase in cell number for this tumor line (Fig. 5e).<br>

Example 6 GSAO triggers release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria<br>
Methods<br>
Rat liver mitochondria were suspended at 1 mg of protein per mL at 25°C in 3 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 buffer containing 75 mM mannitol, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM sodium succinate, and 2 \xM rotenone and treated with the ANT-binding compounds for 0 to 60 min. Reagent concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. Mitochondria in 0.25 mL of reaction were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000g for 5 min and the supernatants were concentrated 10-fold by uitrafiltration through a Microcon YM-3 membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA).  The concentrated supematants<br><br>
were resolved on 8-16% gradient iGeis from Gradipore (Sydney, Australia) under non-reducing conditions and transferred to PVDF membrane. Proteins were detected by Western biot using anti-human cytochrome c polycional antibodies (Product 556433, BD Pharmingen) and anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Dako, Carpinteria, California). Chemiluminescence films were analyzed using a GS-700 Imaging Densitometer and Multi-Analyst software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California).<br>
Results<br>
Incubation of isolated mitochondria with GSAO triggered time-dependent release of Cytochrome C into the medium (Fig. 6A). The ANT ligand, cyclosporin A, partially inhibited this release (Fig. 6B).<br>
Example 7 GSAO inhibited angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane<br>
(CAM) Methods<br>
Fertilised 3 day-old white Leghorn eggs (Spafas, Norwich, CT) were cracked, the embryos with intact yolks placed in 20 x 100 mm petri dishes and incubated for 3 days at 37°C and 3% CO? (Folkman, 1985). Methylcellulose (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) discs containing 5,10 or 50 \xq of either GSAA or GSAO were then applied to the CAM of individual embryos and incubated for 48 h at 37°C and 3% CO2. The discs were made by desiccation of GSAA or GSAO in 10 p.1 of 0 45% methycellulose on teflon rods. The CAMs were observed using a stereomicroscope and scored for no obvious affect or inhibition of CAM angiogenesis as defined by avascular zones. On some occasions CAM blood vessels were injected with India ink and photographed.<br>
Results<br>
In view of the ability of GSAO to selectively kill proliferating, but not growth-quiescent, endothelial cells in vitro, GSAO was tested to determine whether it was an effective inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo.<br>
The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay has been used for the detection and analysis of angiogenesis inhibition (Nguyen et a!., 1994). GSAO inhibited CAM angiogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). Angiogenesis inhibition was defined as avascular zones 48 h after implantation of methylcellulose pellets containing GSAO on the 6-day CAM (Fig. 7Ai). GSAA up to 50 ^g per pellet had no affects on CAM angiogenesis.<br><br>
Example 8 GSAO inhibited tumour angiogenesis and tumour growth in mice<br>
Methods<br>
Primary tumour growth assays<br>
Female 7 to 9 week old SCID or C57BI6/J mice were used (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Mice were held in groups of 3 to 5 at a 12 hour day and night cycle and were given animal chow and water ad libidum. SCID or C57BI6/J mice were anaesthetised by inhalation of isoflurane, the dorsal skin shaved and cleaned with ethanol, and a suspension of 2.5 x 106 BxPC-3, HT1080 or LLC cells in 0.2 mL of PBS, or saline for LLC cells, was injected S.C, in the proximal midline. LLC cells were prepared according to O'Reilly et al. (1997). Tumour volume was calculated using the relationship, a.b2.0.52, where a is the longest and b the shortest diameter. Immunohistochemistry<br>
Tumours were fixed in Buffered Formalde-Fresh (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), embedded in paraffin and 5 jam thick sections were cut and placed on glass slides. Sections were stained with haematoxyiin and eosin or for CD31, PCNA (Holmgren et al., 1995) or fragmented DNA (Gavrielli et al., 1992). Microvessels were counted in 3 tumours, including the smallest and largest, from the control and treatment groups and the density was graded in the most active areas of neovascularisation according to Weidner et al. (1991). The proliferative iridfex was estimated by the percentage of cells scored under 400x magnification. A minimum of 1000 cells was counted in two separate sections. The apoptotic index was estimated by the percentage of cells scored under 400x magnification. A minimum of 1500 cells was counted in two separate sections.<br>
Results<br>
The growth of both human and murine primary tumours in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice, respectively, was markedly suppressed by systemic administration of GSAO. Treatment of SCID mice bearing BxPC-3 (Fig. 7C) or HT1080 (Fig. 7D) tumours, or C57BI6/J mice bearing LLC tumours (Fig. 7E), by subcutaneous administration of 10 mg/kg/day GSAO at a site remote from the tumour resulted in &gt;90%, -70% and -50% inhibition of the rate of tumour growth, respectively. Administration of control GSAA caused 
 <br>
either SCID or C57BI6/J mice, The average mice weights of the GSAO and GSAA treatment groups over the course of the experiments were the same, and there was no apparent macroscopic differences and no morphological changes in the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and spleen of GSAO or GSAA-treated mice (data not shown).<br>
Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumours from the experiment described in Fig. 7C indicated a significant reduction in blood vessel density in the GSAO-treated tumours (p 
The effect of GSAO on tumor growth is consistent with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. GSAO arrested proliferation of endothelial cells in vivo but had no effect on BxPC-3 proliferation at &gt;30-fold higher concentrations (Table 1), and systemic administration of GSAO markedly reduced tumor vascularity in vivo but had no effect on the proiiferative index of the BxPC-3 tumor cells (Fig. 7F).<br>
Example 9<br>
Comparison of Antiproliferative Activity of GSAO and related<br>
Analogues on BAE cells<br>
Methods<br>
Compounds 1-11,12-15 and 20-23 were screened during 72 hours in 96 well plates with 1000 cells/well at day 1 in DMEM 10% FBS. At day 2 cells were treated by different concentrations of compounds. The cells growth was determined and compared to untreated cells at day 4 using MTT revelation (reading at 550 nm). The IC50 values were determined and the increase of activity in comparison to GSAO was calculated as follows:<br>
Increasing activity factor = IC50 (GSAO) / IC50 (GSAO Analogue)<br>
The results are summarised in Table 2 and Figure 8.<br><br><br>
All iCw values are obtained from at least 2 distinct experiments except compound 9 which was measured once.<br>
Results<br>
The results presented in Table 2 suggest compounds where the arsenoxicle group is in an ortho position (relative to the position of the linker group on the phenylene ring) are significantly more active than the anaioguous compounds where the arsenoxide group is in a para position. For example, compound 1 ("o-GSAO") is 53.2 times more active than GSAO. Similarly, the "ortho-arsenoxide" compound 4 is approximately 140 times more active than the corresponding p-arsenoxide analogue (compound 3); compound 22 is approximately 106 times more active than the corresponding p-arsenoxide compound 7; and compound 23 is approximately 20 times more active than the corresponding p-arsenoxide compound 8. These results were entirely unexpected as it was believed that positioning the arsenical moiety at the ortho position would sterically hinder interaction of the arsenic residue with dithiols.<br>

Effect of GSAO and Related Analogues on Induction of the Mitochondrial<br>
Pore Transition<br>
Methods<br><br>
The screening was performed using rat liver mitochondria frozen for 1 or 2 days at -80°C after isolation. The mitochondria swelling was measured by monitoring the decrease in light scattering at 520 nm using a microplate reader.<br>
In all experiments the time needed for half maximal swelling was determined for each compound. Then, the swelling rates were calculated and compared with GSAO. The increase of swelling rate as compared to GSAO was calculated as follows :<br>
Increasing swelling factor = Swelling Rate^sAO Analogue) / Swelling Rate(GSAO)<br>
The results are summarised in Table 3 and presented in Figure 12.<br><br><br>
Results<br>
All compounds tested showed similar or better induction activity than GSAO. The most active compounds were 1, 4, 22 and 23 which showed an increased activity relative to GSAO ranging from 5.4 to 16.3 fold (Table 3; Figure 12). For the MPTP induction, as for antiproliferative activity on BAE cells, ortho-arsenoxide compounds (1, 4, 22 and 23) had increased activity relative to the corresponding para-arsenoxide compounds (GSAO, 3,7 and 8, respectively).<br>
A comparison of MPTP induction versus molecular weight of the compounds is presented in Figure 13.<br>
A comparison of MPTP induction versus Log P of the compound tested is presented in Figure 14.<br>
The antiproliferative activity of GSAO and related analogues was compared to the ability of those compounds to induce the MPT. The results are presented in Figure 15. Compounds which showed increased activity relative to GSAO in both tests were the ortho-arsenoxide compounds 1, 4,22 and 23.<br>

Arsenoxide Compounds<br>
In order to determine if the ortho- or para-position of the arsenoxide moiety on the phenylene ring significantly influenced the compounds ability to bind dithiols, GSAO (para-arsenoxide) and compound 1 (ortho-arsenoxide) were titrated with DTT.<br>
As shown in Figure 16, there was no significant difference in arsenical reactivity for GSAO and Compound 1.<br>
Example 11<br>
Comparison of GSAO and o-GSAO - Mitochondrial Swelling Assay Method<br>
Mitochondria were isolated from the livers of -250 g male Wistar rats using differential centrifugation as described previously (Don et al., 2003). The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 3 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0 buffer containing 213 mM mannitol, 71 mM sucrose and 10 mM sodium succinate at a concentration of 30 mg of protein per mL Mitochondrial permeability transition induction was assessed spectrophotometrically by suspending the liver mitochondria at 0.5 mg of protein per mL at 25°C in 3 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0 buffer containing 75 mM mannitol, 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM sodium sucoinate, and 2 mM rotenone. Swelling was<br><br>
measured by monitoring the associated decrease in light scattering at 520 nm using a microplate reader.<br>
Results<br>
The half-time for maximal swelling of isolated mitochondria was 3-5 times faster for a given concentration of o-GSAO compared to GSAO (Fig. 17). Indeed, o-GSAO was almost as efficient as the lipophilic PAO at inducing the mitochondrial permeability transition (Fig. 17D),<br>
ANT pore formation is controlled by the binding of Ca2+, cyclophilin D and adenine nucleotides under physiological conditions. The primary trigger for opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore is a rise in matrix Ca2+ concentration. Chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA blocks pore opening, as does an excess of other divalent metal ions such as Mg2+. Both EGTA and Mg2+ blocked GSAO-dependent swelling (Fig. 18). Binding of cyclophilin D to ANT is necessary for pore opening at sub-millimolar Ca2+ concentrations. Cyclosporin A (CsA) blocks pore opening by binding to cyclophilin D and displacing it from ANT. In addition, ADP inhibits pore opening by binding to ANT and decreasing the sensitivity of the trigger site to Ca2+. CsA and ADP blocked the effect of o-GSAO on pore opening (Fig. 19).<br>
Example 12 Comparison of GSAO and o-GSAO - Cell Proliferation and Viability Assay<br>
Method<br>
BAE or human pancreatic carcinoma BxPC-3 cells were seeded at a density of 103 cells per well into 96 well plates in DMEM containing 10% foetal bovine serum and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Cells were washed and incubated with DMEM containing 10% foetal bovine serum and GSAO or o-GSAO and cultured for a further 48 h. Some BAE cells were arrested for 24 h in medium containing 0.25% serum and cultured for a further 48 h in medium containing 0.25% or 10% serum, in the presence of GSAO or o-GSAO. Viable attached cells were determined using MTT.<br>
Results<br>
o-GSAO is -50-times more effective than GSAO at inhibiting proliferation of BAE cells. The ICso for proliferation arrest of BAE cells was 8.3 ± 2.1 pM and 0.16 ± 0.03 \iM for GSAO and o-GSAO, respectively (Fig. 20A). o-GSAO, like GSAO, was a selective inhibitor of BAE compared to BxPC-3 cell proliferation. The ICso for proliferation arrest of BxPC-3 cells was &gt;300 (JM and -2 , pM for GSAO and o-GSAO, respectively (Fig. 20B). In contrast to GSAO, however, o-GSAO was not selective for proliferating (angiogenic) endothelial cells (Fig. 21).   O-GSAO reduced the<br><br>
viability of proliferating and growth-quiescent endothelial cells equally well. The response to o-GSAO was very similar to PAO in this experiment (see Don et al., 2003).<br>
Example 13a Comparison of GSAO and o-GSAO - Primary Tumour Growth Assay<br>
Method<br>
Female 7 to 9 week old Balb C nude were used (UNSW Biological Resource Centre). Mice were held in groups of 3 to 5 at a 12 h day and night cycle and were given animal chow and water ad libidum, A suspension of 2.5 x 106 BxPC-3 cells in 0.2 mL of PBS was injected subcutaneously in the proximal midline. Tumours were allowed to establish and grow to a size of -40 mm3 after which they were randomised into four groups. Tumour volume was calculated using the relationship, a.b2.0.52, where a is the longest and b the shortest diameter. Animals were treated with either GSAO or o-GSAO at a dose 1 or 10 mg/kg/day in 0.1 mL of PBS. The compounds were adminfstered subcutaneously at a site distant from the tumour. Tumour volume and animal weight was measured every 2 or 3 days.<br>
Results<br>
There were short-term behavioural side-effects of administration of o-GSAO to Balb C mice, although there was no weight loss observed. The results are presented in Table 3 and Figure 22.<br><br><br><br>
Example 13b Comparison of GSAO and o-GSAO - Anti-tumour Efficacy<br>
Method<br>
Balb-C nude mice bearing -40 mm3 BxPC-3 tumours were randomised into four groups (n = 10 or 11 per group) and treated subcutaneously with either GSAO (part A) or o-GSAO (part B) at 1 or 10 mg/kg/day in 0.1 mL of PBS. Parts C and D are the mice weights for the respective groups, where the arrow indicates start of treatment. The data points are the mean ± SE of the tumour volumes or mice weights. Treatment with 10 mg/kg o-GSAO (part B) was stopped at day 14 due to necrosis and inflammation at sites of injection in 7 out of 11 mice (3/11 with severe ulcers, 4/11 with medium ulcers). There was also some weight loss in this group (part D). Results<br>
Short-term behavioural side-effects were observed following administration of o-GSAO to Balb C mice and also thickening of the skin and occasional necrosis with repeated injections in the same area. The behavioural side-effects were not observed in the Balb C nude mice in the tumour experiment (Example 13a), although the skin necrosis was more severe in these mice. Indeed; treatment with 10 mg/kg o-GSAO was stopped at day 14 due to severe necrosis and inflammation at injection sites in 7 of 11 animals. The only weight loss observed in either mice strain was in this group. These side-effects were not observed with GSAO administration (Fig. 23).<br>
In summary, o-GSAO is more efficacious than GSAO in vitro, but has side-effects that are not apparent with GSAO administration. Unlike GSAO, o-GSAO is not selective for proliferating versus growth-quiescent endothelial cells.<br><br>
