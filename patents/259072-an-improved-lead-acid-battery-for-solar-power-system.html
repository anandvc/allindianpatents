SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A battery consists of number of cells and each cell of the battery consists of (a) positive and negative plates (b) separators (c) electrolyte, all contained in one of the many compartments of battery container. The substances of cell which take active part in chemical relation or produce electricity during charging and discharging are known as active materials of the cell.<br>
The active material of a preferred lead acid are-<br>
1.	Lead peroxide(PbO2) for positive plate<br>
2.	Sponge lead (Pb) for negative plate<br>
3.	Dilute sulphuric acid (H2SO4) as electrolyte<br>
The charging and discharging of the cell can be represented by single reversible equation given below:<br>
PbO2+2H2SO4+Pb==PbSO4+2H20+PbSO4<br>
For discharge, the equation should be read from left to right and for charging from right to left.<br>
The preferred lead acid cell is free from antimony, as antimony is used for hardening effect only. As solar power system is static system hence some mechanical strength can be sacrificed or can be improved with the other ways. Due to presence of antimony in conventional batteries, it promotes the following reaction<br>
5PbO2+2Sb+6H2SO4==(SbO2)2SO4+5PbSO4+6H2O<br>
Hence removes active material slowly and in absence of antimony, the ampere-hour rating of device increases and loss of electrolyte is reduced. The mechanical strength reduced due lack of antimony is acquired again by increasing size of electrode and constructing it tubular form.<br>
