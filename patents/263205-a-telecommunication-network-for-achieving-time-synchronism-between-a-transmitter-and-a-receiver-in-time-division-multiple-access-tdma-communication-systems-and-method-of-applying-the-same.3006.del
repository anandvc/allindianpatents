Field of Invention :<br>
The proposed invention describes a mechanism for achieving time synchronism<br>
between a transmitter and a receiver in Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)<br>
communication systems.<br>
Background of Invaition :<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a mobile telephone 100 that commumcates with a base station (not<br>
shown) using a time division multiplex (TDM) scheme such that bursts containing<br>
series of digital symbols are periodically exchanged between the telephone and the<br>
base station. Figure 1 illustrates the mobile telephone 100 from the standpoint of its<br>
function as a receiver. Figure 1 illustrates certain major processes that are involved in<br>
the processing of received signals and the skilled person will realise that some<br>
processes have- been omitted for the sakes of clarity and brevity. It will be understood<br>
by a person skilled in the art that whilst Figure 1 illustrates a chain of processing<br>
activities, Figure 1 does not necessarily reflect how these processes would be<br>
implemented in a practical device. Usually, the processes shown in Figure 1 would be<br>
implemented as a mixture of hardware and software entities.<br>
A signal burst received at the antenna 109 of the telephone 100 from the base station<br>
is first processed by the Radio-Frequency (RF) unit 101 to produce an analogue<br>
electrical signal which is passed to a mixed-signal processing unit 102 for conversion<br>
to a digital format The mixed signal processing unit 102 performs analogue to digital<br>
conversion (ADC) of the analogue signal at 103, followed by digital low pass filtering<br>
at 104 and then decimation at 105. The decimated signal is then passed to a digital<br>
signal processing block 106. The processing performed by block 106 includes<br>
demodulation at 107 to produce estimates of the transmitted information bits. The<br>
estimated information bits are then put to their intended purpose, typically the<br>
reconstruction of speech.<br>
Object of the Invention :<br>
The purpose of the decimation process 105 is to reduce the number of samples per<br>
second which are provided to the digital signal processing unit 106. This rate<br>
reduction is defined by a decimation factor D. The decimation process 105 outputs<br>
one sample for every D samples from the low-pass filtering process 104. The<br><br>
sampling phase of the decimation process 105 is the position, within a group of D<br>
samples that are to be decimated, of the sample that is to survive the decimation<br>
process and be provided as an output. Due to implementation complexity issues, the<br>
sampling phase in the mixed-signal processing unit 102 is usually fixed.<br>
Description of Prior Art :<br>
In addition to producing estimates of transmitted information bits, the digital signal<br>
processing block 106 also generates estimates of a timing error indicating any<br>
mismatch between the sampling instants used by the ADC unit 103 and the<br>
boundaries of information symbols in the current burst from the transmitter. The<br>
timing error estimates are then used to correct the timing of the sampling instants that<br>
are used by the ADC unit 103 in the digitisation of the next burst to be received from<br>
the transmitter. Averaging or filtering of the timing error estimates is performed by<br>
process 108 prior to their use in adjusting the sample acquisition timing of the ADC<br>
unit 103. This filtering stage 108 improves the accuracy of the corrections that are<br>
made to the sample acquisition timing of the ADC unit 103. The loop through<br>
filtering stage 108 is known as the timing recovery loop.<br>
The approach described above imposes two constraints on the performance of the<br>
timing-recovery loop. First, the timing resolution of the samples processed by the<br>
digital; signal processing block 106 is set by the frequency at which the mixed-signal<br>
processing unit 102 operates (i.e. the frequency at which ADC unit 103 produces<br>
digital samples) and the decimation factor J} used by process 105. If, in order for the<br>
telephone to demodulate received bursts satisfactorily, a better timing resolution is<br>
required by the digital signal processing section 106, either the decimation factor<br>
needs to be reduced or the operating rate of the mixed-signal unit 102 needs to be<br>
increased. Either of these options will increase the power consumption of the mixed-<br>
signal processing section 102 and will also increase the memory required by the<br>
digital signal processing block 106 to store the digital samples arriving from the<br>
mixed-signal processing stage 102. Second, once the mixed-signal unit 102 starts<br>
generating samples, the period between consecutive samples is effectively constant,<br>
This is due to the fact that usually it is not possible to satisfactorily change the<br>
sampling phase of the decimation process 105 while receiving samples from the<br>
upstream processes 103 and 104, These limitations may lead to receiver performance<br><br>
degradation in a number of circumstances. Two such scenarios will .now be<br>
described.<br>
Advantages and Disadvantages over Prior Art :<br>
In the E-GPRS (Enhanced General Packet Radio Service) system, the information is<br>
transmitted in bursts, also referred to as slots, of a fixed size. A burst is defined to<br>
contain 156% symbols ('3GPP TS 05.02, 3rd Generation Partnership Project,<br>
Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE; Radio Access Network; Multiplexing<br>
and multiple access on the radio path'). Hence, when multi-slot transmission is used<br>
to achieve high throughput, the receiver riming will slip by an extra quarter symbol<br>
for each slot following the first one. The SPSK modulation, which is used in the E-<br>
GPRS system, is very sensitive to timing errors, even when the timing error is sub-<br>
symbol. Hence, if this quarter symbol slip is not corrected at a receiver, transmission<br>
link quality will degrade and link throughput will be reduced. One potential way to<br>
correct this quarter symbol slip is to change the sampling phase of the decimation<br>
process 105 between the different slots. However, this usually is not possible without<br>
having to completely refresh the contents of the preceding low-pass filtering process<br>
104 and such a refresh event will result in the loss of a few symbols of the received<br>
burst thus degrading receiver performance. Hence, the approach described in Figure 1<br>
for the receiver timing recovery loop will not perform very well for the E-GPRS<br>
system.<br>
Another possible scenario where the timing recovery loop of Figure 1 may not<br>
provide adequate performance is when constraints are set on when the timing of a<br>
receiver can be changed. For example, in order to reduce the implementation<br>
complexity, it is possible for a receiver to use the same timing reference for both<br>
uplink and downlink timing. In this case, transmission timings and reception timings<br>
are derived from a single master timing event. In cellular communication systems,<br>
limits can be imposed by a network as to when uplink timing can be changed. For<br>
example, in the E-GPRS system, uplink timing can only be changed if a timing error<br>
greater than half the duration of one symbol is present. If uplink and downlink<br>
timings are locked, this restriction on uplink timing changes can result in a downlink<br>
timing error of up to the duration of half a symbol. Such a residual error can degrade<br>
the performance of the demodulation process 107 and will reduce communications<br><br>
link throughput. One possible way to address these drawbacks discussed .above is<br>
shown in Figure 2.<br>
The approach used in Figure 2 is similar to the that used in Figure 1 and elements 201<br>
to 205, 208 and 209 of Figure 2 correspond, respectively, to elements 102 to 108 in<br>
Figure 1 and their function will not be described in detail again. However, two new<br>
processes 206 and 208 have been added to the digital signal processing stage 205.<br>
The signal from the mixed-signal processing unit 201 goes first through a low-pass<br>
filtering process 206 and is then decimated using process 207 before being<br>
demodulated at 208. Any potential frequency aliasing that could be introduced by the<br>
decimation process 207 is removed by the low-pass filtering process 206.<br>
The minimum sampling rate at the output of the mixed-signal stage 201 needs to be<br>
set to meet the timing resolution required by the digital signal processing stage 205.<br>
This means that the sampling rate at the output of the mixed-signal processing unit<br>
will usually be significantly higher than the information data rate. The higher<br>
sampling rate at the input to the digital signal processing block 205 makes it possible<br>
for the receiver to adjust the timing of the received signal by selecting different<br>
sampling phases in the decimation process 207, The decision on the sampling phase<br>
to be used in the decimation process can be derived from different sources. It can for<br>
example be based on the estimates of the residual timing error. This overall approach<br>
leads to a timing recovery loop with a potentially very fine time resolution. However,<br>
there are two major obstacles to the implementation of the solution shown in Figure 2.<br>
First, to.obtain the fine time resolution, the mixed-signal processing unit needs to be<br>
operated at clock rates significantly larger than the information date rate. This will<br>
have associated costs in terms of silicon die size and/or power consumption. Second,<br>
because the sampling rate at the input of the digital signal processing will be higher<br>
than the information rate, larger buffers will be required to store the receiver samples.<br>
This will have a deleterious impact on the overall memory requirements of the<br>
receiver.<br>
Sjimary of the Irivantion :<br>
The present invention aims to provide an alternative timing recovery loop for control<br>
of receiver timing.<br><br>
According to one aspect, the invention provides a telecommunications network<br>
participant, comprising means for digitising, as a series of samples, a received signal<br>
containing a succession of symbols, means for measuring time misalignment between<br>
the symbols and the samples and means for applying a fractional delay to the<br>
positions of the samples to reduce the misalignment.<br>
The invention also consists in a method of digitising a received telecommunications<br>
signal, the method comprising digitising, as a series of samples, a received sipal<br>
containing a succession of symbols, measuring time misalignment between the<br>
symbols and the samples and applying a fractional delay to the positions of the<br>
samples to reduce the misalignment.<br>
The invention may permit a fine timing resolution to be achieved without the<br>
necessity of a high sampling rate. In turn, this may lead to a reduction in power<br>
consumption and memory requirements.<br>
In certain embodiments, the timing of the digitisation of the samples is adjusted to<br>
suppress the misalignment.<br>
In certain embodiments, the samples are shifted in time, either forwards or backwards,<br>
by one or more integer symbol positions to suppress the misalignment. For example,<br>
by applying an integer sample shift of +1 sample positions and a fractional delay of %<br>
of a symbol position, a net misalignment of +lA sample positions can be corrected.<br>
In certain embodiments, the received signal has a format such that the symbols are<br>
arranged in bursts, a respective timing error is deduced for each of one or more bursts<br>
and a fractional delay is applied to the positions of the samples to suppress the timing<br>
error or errors.<br>
In certain embodiments, the received signal has a format such that the symbols are<br>
arranged in bursts, a timing error is deduced for each of several bursts and the errors<br><br>
are combined to produce a resultant error and a fractional delay is applied to the<br>
positions of the samples to suppress the resultant error.<br>
In certain embodiments, the received signal has a format in which the bursts are<br>
grouped into a repeated time frame, the time frame containing a number of time slots,<br>
each time slot containing a burst and, for each of a plurality of said time slots, a<br>
timing error is deduced for each of one or more bursts in the respective slot and a<br>
fractional delay is applied to the positions of the samples to suppress the timing error<br>
or errors of the respective slot.<br>
In certain embodiments, the received signal has a format in which the bursts are<br>
grouped into a repeated time frame, the time frame containing a number of time slots,<br>
each time slot containing a burst and, for each of a plurality of said time slots, a<br>
timing error is deduced for each of several bursts and timing errors of the respective<br>
slot are combined into a resultant error for the respective slot and a fractional delay is<br>
applied to the positions of the samples to suppress the resultant error of the respective<br>
slot.'.<br>
In certain embodiments, timing errors from different time slots are combined to<br>
produce a sampling timing error and the timing of the digitisation of the samples is<br>
adjusted to suppress the sampling timing error.<br>
In certain embodiments, a timing error for a burst is deduced by calculating the<br>
position of a known training sequence in ihe burst and measuring the time offset<br>
between said position and an ideal position in the burst of said training sequence.<br>
In certain embodiments, a desired fractional delay is applied to samples by<br>
appropriately reconfiguring a fractional delay filter providing the delay. Several pre-<br>
stored configurations of the filter may be provided such that the filter can be<br>
reconfigured by selecting for the filter the configuration that most closely matches the<br>
desired fractional delay.<br><br>
In certain embodiments, the digitisation of the signal takes place at substantially the<br>
same rate as the information modulation rate of the received signal.<br>
The invention is applicable to various communication systems and is particularly well<br>
suited to the E-GPRS system.<br>
The invention can be realised in hardware, in software on a processor, or a<br>
combination thereof.<br>
Description of accompanying drawings :<br>
The invention can be utilised in, for example, a base station or a mobile telephone.<br>
By way of example only, certain embodiments of the invention will now be described<br>
with reference to the accompanying Figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a conventional mobile telephone, focussing on aspects of related to its<br>
timing recovery loop;<br>
Figure 2 shows a potential modification that could be made to the timing recovery<br>
loop of Figure 1 to improve the time resolution of the loop;<br>
Figure 3 presents a timing loop according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of a timing loop according to the present<br>
invention: and<br>
Figure 5 shows the two alternative formats for information bursts transmitted by a<br>
GSM/GPRS/E-GPRS base-station.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates an adaptation of the timing recovery loop described earlier with<br>
reference to Figure 1. Elements 301 to 304,305 and 307 correspond, respectively, to<br>
elements 102 to 107 of Figure 1 and their functions will not be described again in<br>
detail. Whereas in Figure 2 the sampling rate at the output of the mixed-signal<br>
processing stage is set to provide the timing resolution required by the digital signal<br>
processing block 305, the sampling rate at the output of the mixed-signal unit 301 is<br><br>
set merely to the rate required by the demodulation process 307 in the absence of any<br>
timing error. This will be typically of the same order as the information data rate. By<br>
keeping the sampling rate at the output of the mixed-signal unit 301 to a low value,<br>
power consumption and memory requirements are reduced. However, this approach<br>
means that a residual timing error can be present in the signal input to the digital<br>
signal processing block 305. This error is removed by fractional delay process 306<br>
which acts on the signal en route to the demodulation process 307.<br>
Detailed Description of preferred erfcodinEnts :<br>
In this embodiment, the fractional delay process 306 implements a fractional delay<br>
filter. Such filters are designed to have a flat amplitude response and a linear phase<br>
response across the bandwidth of the input signal. Hence, information passing<br>
through process 306 is not modified but simply delayed. By selecting the slope of the<br>
linear phase response a delay of any given value can be applied to the sampling<br>
points. The operation of process 306 can be regarded as equivalent to that of a perfect<br>
interpolator (as long as the sampling rate satisfies the Nyquist criterion). Of specific<br>
interest to the proposed invention is the fact that the delay introduced by the fractional<br>
delay process can be lower than the period of the samples at the output of the mixed-<br>
signal processing unit. Hence, the fractional delay process 306 can implement a<br>
fraction-delay filter to correct any residual timing error in the signal supplied by the<br>
mixed-signal unit 30 1.<br>
The value of the delay introduced by the fractional delay process 306 is derived from<br>
estimates of the residual timing error calculated by the digital signal processing block<br>
305. A timing error estimate is produced for each burst that is processed by block<br>
305. These timing error estimates are passed to a low-pass filtering, or averaging,<br>
process 308 such that the accuracy of those estimates can be improved,<br>
Improvements to the accuracy of the corrections being made by the fractional delay<br>
process 306 can be achieved by selecting the timing error estimates used by the low-<br>
pass filtering process 308. If noisy timing error estimates are excised and not used to<br>
calculate the value of the correction to be applied by the fractional delay process 306,<br>
the residual timing error at the input to the demodulation process 307 can be reduced.<br><br>
excluded from the filtering process 308. For example, the digital signal processing<br>
block 305 could be configured to send the filtering process 308 a timing error only if<br>
the burst to which that error relates has been demodulated with less than a certain<br>
proportion of errors.<br>
The timing error estimates are also used to	correct the timing of the digital sample<br>
acquisition timing by the ADC unit 302. As	is done with the timing corrections made<br>
in the digital signal processing section, the	timing error estimates are first low-pass<br>
filtered in process 309 before being used	to adjust the digital sample acquisition<br>
timing of the ADC unit 302.<br>
Various approaches can be used by the digital signal processing block 305 to derive<br>
estimates of the residual timing error in the filtered signal emerging from process 306.<br>
For example, in some digital communications systems the transmitter embeds a<br>
sequence of known symbols in the block of information constituting a burst. This is<br>
the case in the E-GPRS system, where a sequence of 26 symbols collectively referred<br>
to as a training sequence and which is known to the receiver is inserted in the middle<br>
of each information burst. This training sequence can be used by the digital signal<br>
processing block 305 in a known manner to estimate how far the timing of the<br>
received burst is from the ideal value and thereby produce a timing error estimate for<br>
each burst.<br>
The fractional delay filter can be implemented using either an Infinite Impulse<br>
Response (TJR) or- Finite Impulse Response (FIR) structure. Filtering techniques<br>
based in the frequency domain could also be used for the implementation.<br>
The timing resolution of the delay introduced by the fractional delay process 306<br>
allows complexity to be traded-off against performance. For a given timing<br>
correction, it is possible to calculate adaptively the required configuration for the<br>
fractional delay filter that needs to be implemented by process 306. Hence, the<br>
configuration of the fractional delay filter could be calculated for each new burst<br>
using a timing correction established on the basis of timing errors measured for earlier<br>
bursts. Such an approach should lead to good performance in terms reducing the<br><br>
residual timing error at the input to the demodulation process 307. However, the<br>
implementation of this solution could require the adaptive derivation of a new<br>
fractional delay filter for each burst received at the digital signal processing block 305<br>
and hence could prove too complex. The implementation complexity of the fractional<br>
delay process 306 can be reduced if the resolution of the timing corrections that are to<br>
be applied is reduced. Reducing the resolution of the timing corrections that are to be<br>
applied by the fractional delay process 306 limits the number of possible corrections,<br>
If the number of possible correction values is low enough, it is possible to pre-<br>
calculate and store a configuration of the fractional delay filter for each of the possible<br>
correction values. In such a case, it is not necessary to calculate a new configuration<br>
for each incoming burst, rather the fractional delay process 306 only needs to engage<br>
the stored fractional delay filter configuration with the timing correction value that is<br>
closest to the desired one, One consequence of using such an approach is that even<br>
after the fractional delay correction, the timing of the received signal will not be<br>
perfect. Hence, this could slightly degrade the performance of the demodulation<br>
process. However, this performance degradation can be kept to a minimum by<br>
carefully selecting the timing correction resolution of the stored filter configurations.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates how the timing recovery loop of Figure 3 can be adapted to cope<br>
with ■multi-slot reception in an E-GPRS receiver. Figure 4 illustrates a processing<br>
scheme for the reception of two slots but it is possible to extend it to any desired<br>
number of slots. Elements 401 to 404 and 4 14 correspond, respectively, to elements<br>
301 to 304 and 309 of Figure 3 and their fimctions will not be described again in<br>
detail. Two versions 405 and 408 of digital signal processing block 305 are included,<br>
each for handling a respective one of the received slots. Each of blocks 405 and 408<br>
includes a respective fractional delay process 406 and 409 for adjusting the sample<br>
timing in the manner of process 306 and a respective demodulation process 407 and<br>
410 for producing estimates of the transmitted information bits from the respective<br>
slots: The fractional delay processes 406 and 409 implement delays that can be<br>
adapted on the basis of timing errors deduced by their respective digital signal<br>
processing blocks 405 and 408. The timing errors are filtered by respective averaging<br>
filters 411 and 412 prior to their use in adapting their respective fractional delay<br>
processes 406 and 409. It is important to note that the two signal processing blocks<br><br>
405 and 408 do not necessarily correspond to two separate physical entities as they<br>
could be software processes running in time-shared fashion on a single processor or<br>
other hardware block which is time-shared between the different time slots hardware<br>
element. Although the slots that are to be demodulated by blocks 405 and 407 are not<br>
received contemporaneously, the processing performed by blocks 405 and 407 may<br>
overlap in time to some (greater or lesser) degree.<br>
Each of digital signal processing blocks 405 and 408 provides an estimate of the<br>
residual timing error in its corresponding time slot. The separate timing errors from<br>
blocks 405 and 408 are then brought together in a combining process 413 (typically<br>
by averaging) to generate a single residual timing error, This combined timing error<br>
is then subjected to averaging over a number of bursts by filtering process 414 and the<br>
filtered result' 'is used to adapt the digital sample acquisition timing that is used by<br>
ADC process 402. Thus, the adaptation of ADC sample acquisition timing is done<br>
according to the timing error values from all of the time slots involved in the multi-<br>
slot transmission. Hence, the timing of the mixed-signal processing unit 401 is<br>
updated such that the average timing error across the different time slots involved in<br>
the multi-slot transmission is driven to zero. However, the correct timing for each of<br>
these individual time slots individually is normally different from this average value.<br>
This is why the timing corrections made by the fractional delay unit 406 and 409 are<br>
derived from the timing error estimate from the time slot to which the correction will<br>
be applied. Hence, the correction values of the fractional delay processes 406 and 409<br>
can differ from one another. This means that even though the decimation process 404<br>
in the mixed signal processing unit 401 will generate samples with a fixed period, the<br>
distance in time between symbols corresponding to different time slots can be<br>
adjusted with a resolution which is only limited by the resolution of the corrections<br>
made by the fractional delay processes 406 and 409.<br>
In a preferred implementation, three pre-calculated fractional delay filter<br>
configurations are stored. Those different configurations correspond to timing<br>
corrections of lA} Vz and 3A of the modulation symbol period. This means that each<br>
fractional delay process 406, 409 can use those configurations to make corrections<br>
with a resolution equal to ± lh of a modulation symbol. This time resolution<br><br>
provides a good trade-off between implementation complexity and demodulation<br>
performance. Timing corrections of integer values of the symbol duration can easily<br>
be made by simply changing the symbol position within the burst that denotes the<br>
start of the part of the burst that has to be demodulated.<br>
As explained earlier, in the E-GPRS system, the transmitter formats information in<br>
slots of symbols. Eight such slots are then grouped together to form a TDMA frame<br>
with duration equal to 4.165 ms. Each slot is normally specified to correspond to<br>
156'/4 modulation symbols. However, two different options have been defined in the<br>
standard ('3GPP TS 45.010, Technical Specification 3rd Generation Partnership<br>
Project; Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network; Radio<br>
subsystem synchronisation') as to how base-stations can group together the different<br>
slots in a singie TDMA frame. Those different formats are illustrated in Figure 5 for<br>
two types of base stations. It can be seen that in both cases, the number of modulation<br>
symbols in a TDMA frame is always equal to 1250. However, the number of symbols<br>
across two consecutive slots is not identical for the two formats. In one of the two<br>
formats, each slot is always 156% symbols long. In the other format, the length of<br>
consecutive slots alternates between 156 and 157 symbols. This means that the<br>
timing corrections to be made by the receiver will need to be different depending on<br>
which of these formats is used in a received transmission. The problem is<br>
exacerbated in that a receiver will not be informed .of the timing format of the<br>
consecutive incoming bursts and hence the receiver will need to adapt to the selected<br>
format in a blind fashion. The scheme proposed in Figure 4 achieves this goal by<br>
keeping the calculation of the timing corrections being made by the fractional delay<br>
processes 406 and 409 separate for the different slots involved in a multi-slot<br>
transmission. Consequently, the corrections made by the fractional delay processes<br>
406 and 409 can be different for the different slots involved in a multi-slot<br>
transmission and will automatically match the transmission format.<br><br>
