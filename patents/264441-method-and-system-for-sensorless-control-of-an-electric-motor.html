				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR SENSORLESS CONTROL OF AN<br>
ELECTRIC MOTOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to the control of electric<br>
motors. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method and<br>
system for sensorless control of an electric motor, such as one in used in a<br>
drive system of an automobile.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the complexity of the electrical and drive systems<br>
within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles, such as hybrid,<br>
electric, and fuel cell vehicles. Such alternative fuel vehicles typically use an<br>
electric motor, perhaps in combination with another actuator, to drive the<br>
wheels.<br>
[0003] Traditional motor control systems normally include a feedback<br>
device or position sensor, such as a resolver or encoder, to provide speed and<br>
position information about the motor. Feedback devices and associated<br>
interface circuits increase the costs of a motor control system, and these costs<br>
may become prohibitive in high volume applications such as the production of<br>
automobiles. Additionally, a position sensor and its associated wiring harness<br>
increase the complexity and assembly time of an electric drive system in a<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0004] Electric vehicles powered by fuel cells, batteries and hybrid<br>
systems that include electric motors are becoming more common in the<br>
automotive market. As production volumes for electric vehicles increase, the<br>
cost of feedback devices and associated interface circuits will become<br>
significant. Automakers are therefore always striving to cut costs and reduce<br><br>
the number of parts for a vehicle. The removal of a feedback device for an<br>
electric motor control system will lead to significant cost reductions for an<br>
electric vehicle.<br>
[0005] Hybrid electric and electric vehicles today utilize numerous electric<br>
motor control technologies such as the vector control of electric motors. A<br>
vector motor control scheme is a computationally intensive motor control<br>
scheme that maps the phase voltages/currents of a three-phase motor into a<br>
two axis coordinate system. The structure used to excite an electric motor<br>
using a vector control scheme is a typical three-phase power source inverter<br>
including six power transistors that shape the output voltage to an electric<br>
motor. Vector control requires rotor position information, which is normally<br>
obtained via a feedback device or position sensor. The objective of the<br>
position sensorless control is to obtain the rotor position information utilizing<br>
electromagnetic characteristics of an AC machine, eliminating the position<br>
sensor and its associated interface circuits.<br>
[0006J Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an improved method and<br>
system for sensorless control of an electric motor. Furthermore, other<br>
desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the appended claims,<br>
taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the foregoing<br>
technical field and background.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] A method for controlling an electric motor is provided. A signal<br>
including at least first and second cycles is provided to the electric motor. A<br>
first flux value for the electric motor associated with the first cycle of the<br>
signal is calculated. A second flux value for the electric motor associated with<br>
the second cycle of the signal is calculated based on the first flux value.<br>
[0008] A method for controlling an automotive electric motor having a<br>
winding is provided. A signal including first and second cycles is provided to<br>
the electric motor. A winding flux error is determined based on a measured<br><br>
winding flux and an estimated winding flux. A first flux value of the electric<br>
motor is calculated based on the winding flux error. The first flux value<br>
includes flux linkage, a back electromotive force (BEMF) generated by the<br>
motor, or a combination of the flux linkage and the BEMF.<br>
[0009] An automotive drive system is provided. The automotive drive<br>
system includes an electric motor, a direct current (DC) power supply coupled<br>
to the electric motor, a power inverter coupled to the electric motor and the<br>
DC power supply to receive DC power from the DC power supply and provide<br>
alternating current (AC) power to the electric motor, and a processor in<br>
operable communication with the electric motor, the DC power supply, and<br>
the power inverter. The processor is configured to provide a signal including<br>
at least first and second cycles to the electric motor, calculate a first flux value<br>
for the electric motor associated with the first cycle of the signal, and calculate<br>
a second flux value for the electric motor associated with the second cycle of<br>
the signal based on the first flux value.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0024] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description. Additionally, although the<br>
schematic diagrams shown herein depict example arrangements of elements,<br>
additional intervening elements, devices, features, or components may be<br>
present in an actual embodiment. It should also be understood that FIGS. 1-15<br>
are merely illustrative and may not be drawn to scale.<br>
[0025] FIG. 1 to FIG. 15 illustrate a method and system for controlling an<br>
electric motor. The system includes a digitally controlled flux observer that is<br><br>
implemented in a discrete time domain. More particularly, the flux observer<br>
utilizes the signal (e.g., a pulse width modulation signal) which is used to<br>
drive the electric motor to time the updates made to flux and back<br>
electromotive force (BEMF) measurements.<br>
[0026] For example, in one embodiment, a signal including at least first<br>
and second cycles is provided to the electric motor. A first flux value for the<br>
electric motor and associated with the first cycle of the signal is calculated. A<br>
second flux value for the electric motor and associated with the second cycle<br>
is calculated based on (or derived from) the first flux value. The process is<br>
then repeated. The first and second flux values may be, for example,<br>
estimated flux linkages, estimated BEMF strengths, estimated flux increments,<br>
estimated BEMF increments, or any combination thereof.<br>
[0027] The current flowing through the electric motor may also be<br>
measured during the second cycle, and the second flux value may also be<br>
based on the measured current. The signal may also include a third cycle that<br>
occurs before the first and second cycles, during which a current flowing<br>
through the electric motor may be measured. The second flux value may also<br>
be based on the current measured during the third cycle.<br>
[0028] In another embodiment, a winding flux error is determined based<br>
on a measured winding flux and an estimated winding flux. A flux value (e.g.,<br>
flux linkage and/or BEMF) of the electric motor is calculated based on the<br>
winding flux error.<br>
[0029] FIG. 1 illustrates a vehicle 20, or "automobile," according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The automobile 20 includes a chassis<br>
22, a body 24, four wheels 26, and an electronic control system (or electronic<br>
control unit (ECU)) 28. The body 24 is arranged on the chassis 22 and<br>
substantially encloses the other components of the automobile 20. The body<br>
24 and the chassis 22 may jointly form a frame. The wheels 26 are each<br>
rotationally coupled to the chassis 22 near a respective corner of the body 24.<br>
[0030] The automobile 20 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br><br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD) or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 20 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines (or actuators), such as, for example,<br>
a gasoline or diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV)<br>
engine (i.e., using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound<br>
(e.g., hydrogen and/or natural gas) fueled engine, or a fuel cell, a<br>
combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and an electric motor.<br>
[0031] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
20 is a hybrid vehicle, and further includes an actuator assembly (or<br>
powertrain) 30, a battery 32, a power inverter (or inverter) 34, and a radiator<br>
36. The actuator assembly 30 includes an internal combustion engine 38 and<br>
an electric motor/generator (or motor) system (or assembly) 40. The electric<br>
motor system 40, in one embodiment, includes one or more sinusoidally-<br>
wound, three-phase alternating current (AC) motor/generators (or motors)<br>
(e.g., permanent magnet) such as commonly used in automotive vehicles (e.g.,<br>
traction drive control systems, and the like). As will be appreciated by one<br>
skilled in the art, each of the electric motors includes a stator assembly<br>
(including conductive coils), a rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic<br>
core), and a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant). The stator assembly and/or the rotor<br>
assembly within the electric motors may include multiple (e.g., sixteen)<br>
electromagnetic poles, as is commonly understood.<br>
[0032] Still referring to FIG. 1, and as described in greater detail below,<br>
the combustion engine 38 and the electric motor system 40 are integrated such<br>
that both are mechanically coupled to at least some of the wheels 26 through<br>
one or more drive shafts 42. The radiator 36 is connected to the frame at an<br>
outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes multiple<br>
cooling channels therethough that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant) such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze) and is coupled to the engine 38<br>
and the inverter 34. Referring again to FIG. 1, in the depicted embodiment,<br>
the inverter 34 receives and shares coolant with the electric motor 40. The<br><br>
radiator 36 may be similarly connected to the inverter 34 and/or the electric<br>
motor 40.<br>
[0033] The electronic control system 28 is in operable communication<br>
with the actuator assembly 30, the battery 32, and the inverter 34. Although<br>
not shown in detail, the electronic control system 28 includes various sensors<br>
and automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as<br>
an inverter control module and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below.<br>
[0034] Referring to FIG. 2, a voltage source inverter system (or electric<br>
drive system) 44 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The voltage source inverter system 44 includes a digital<br>
controller 46, the inverter 34 coupled to an output of the controller 46, the<br>
motor 40 coupled to a first output of the inverter 34, and a modulator 48<br>
having an input coupled to a second output of the inverter 34 and having an<br>
output coupled to an input of the controller 46. The controller 46 and the<br>
modulator 48 may be integral with the electronic control system 28 shown in<br>
FIG. 1.<br>
[0035] FIG. 3 illustrates the inverter 34 of FIGS. 1 and 2 in greater detail.<br>
The inverter 34 includes a three-phase circuit coupled to the motor 40. More<br>
specifically, the inverter 34 includes a switch network having a first input<br>
coupled to a voltage source Vdc (e.g., the battery 32) and an output coupled to<br>
the motor 40. Although a single voltage source is shown, a distributed direct<br>
current (DC) link with two series sources may be used.<br>
[0036] The switch network comprises three pairs (a, b, and c) of series<br>
switches with antiparallel diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch)<br>
corresponding to each of the phases. Each of the pairs of series switches<br>
comprises a first switch, or transistor, (i.e., a "high" switch) 50, 52, and 54<br>
having a first terminal coupled to a positive electrode of the voltage source 32<br>
and a second switch (i.e., a "low" switch) 56, 58, and 60 having a second<br><br>
terminal coupled to a negative electrode of the voltage source 32 and having a<br>
first terminal coupled to a second terminal of the respective first switch 50, 52,<br>
and 54.<br>
[0037] Still referring to FIG. 1, the automobile 20 is operated by providing<br>
power to the wheels 26 with the combustion engine 38 and the electric motor<br>
40 in an alternating manner and/or with the combustion engine 38 and the<br>
electric motor 40 simultaneously. In order to power the electric motor 40, DC<br>
power is provided from the battery 32 to the inverter 34, which converts the<br>
DC power into AC power, before the power is sent to the electric motor 40.<br>
As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the conversion of DC power to<br>
AC power is substantially performed by operating (i.e., repeatedly switching)<br>
the switches 50 - 60 within the inverter 34 at a "switching frequency," such as,<br>
for example, 12 kilohertz (kHz).<br>
[0038] Referring again to FIG. 2, generally, the controller 46 produces<br>
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, including multiple cycles, for<br>
controlling the switching action of the inverter 34, and thus the motor 40. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the controller 46 preferably produces continuous PWM<br>
(CPWM) signals where each upper and lower switch conducts for a portion of<br>
each switching cycle of the inverter 34. The inverter 34 then converts the<br>
PWM signals to a modulated voltage waveform for operating the motor 40.<br>
[0039] In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method<br>
(or algorithm) and system for estimating rotor position of a permanent magnet<br>
AC machine (e.g., the motor 40) are provided. This algorithm may be used<br>
during high speed motor operation. The motor flux (or flux linkage) and<br>
BEMF increment are calculated or estimated based on currents and voltages<br>
(i.e., commanded or measured) within the motor. The estimated flux is<br>
compared with a measured flux. The flux and BEMF estimation is updated<br>
based on the flux and BEMF increment from the motor model and the flux<br>
error.<br>
[0040] FIG. 4 is a block diagram illustrating a method and/or system 62<br>
for estimating the rotor position and speed of a motor according to one<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention. The method and/or system 62 includes<br>
a motor model block 64, a flux model block 66, a flux observer block 68, a<br>
coordinate conversion block 70, and a speed and position observer block 72.<br>
In one embodiment, the system 62 utilizes the calculations of flux and back<br>
electromotive force (BEMF) implemented at the synchronously rotating<br>
reference frame (or synchronous frame) made by the flux observer block (or<br>
flux observer) 68.<br>
[0041] The motor model block (or motor model) 64 receives a motor<br>
voltage and a motor current as input, along with an estimated flux and BEMF<br>
from the flux observer block 68. The motor model block 64 generates<br>
increments of the flux and the BEMF for each sampling time (or each cycle of<br>
the PWM signal) which are sent to the flux observer block 68. The flux model<br>
block (or flux model) 66 receives the motor current as an input and generates a<br>
measure of the motor flux from, for example, a flux table. A flux error is<br>
calculated from the difference of the estimated flux from the flux observer<br>
block 68 and the measured flux from the flux model block 66 at summation<br>
circuit (or summer) 73. The measured flux, or flux quantity, is also used as a<br>
feedforward control (or decoupling current) of the current control for the<br>
motor. The flux error and the increments from the motor model block 64 are<br>
received as input by the flux observer block 68, which estimates the motor<br>
flux and BEMF.<br>
[0042] In one embodiment, the estimated flux accounts for the flux<br>
generated by the windings in the stator of the motor 40, while the flux<br>
generated by the permanent magnets in the motor 40 is excluded. One<br>
advantage of this method is that the estimated flux is not dependent on the<br>
temperature of the motor magnets, as it is determined by the geometry of the<br>
motor and the material properties of the stator and rotor core. The estimated<br>
BEMF corresponds to the voltage induced by the permanent magnet flux, and<br>
its angle contains the position estimation error.<br>
[0043] The estimated position error is then sent to the speed and position<br>
observer block 72 to estimate the rotor position and speed. Because the<br><br>
magnitude of the estimated BEMF is not used in the position and speed<br>
estimation, the temperature variation of the rotor, especially the permanent<br>
magnet, does not affect the estimation of the rotor position and speed.<br>
[0044] FIG. 5 illustrates the motor model block 64 in greater detail. The<br>
motor model block 64 includes summers 74-84, resistor value blocks 86,<br>
operating frequency value blocks 88, and sampling time value blocks 90. As<br>
shown, synchronous reference frame voltages,   and   are<br>
subtracted by the voltage drops at the stator resistor at summers 74 and 76,<br>
respectively. The voltage drops are determined by multiplying measured<br>
synchronous frame currents,  by the resistance value of the<br>
stator resistor  As will be described in greater detail below, the value k<br>
corresponds to a particular cycle in the PWM signal.<br>
[0045] The resulting net voltages contribute to the stator fluxes. At<br>
summers 78 and 80, respectively, voltages induced by estimated winding<br>
fluxes, are subtracted after being multiplied by the<br>
operating frequency  While at summers 82 and 84, estimated BEMF<br>
values,   are subtracted. The remaining voltage<br>
values are multiplied by the sampling periods of calculation, , and result in<br>
the expected flux increment of the winding fluxes at the k-th sampling period,<br><br>
[0046] FIG. 6 illustrates the flux model block 66 in greater detail. The<br>
flux model block 66 includes flux table blocks 92, 94, and 96 and summers 98,<br>
100, and 102. In one embodiment, the flux tables 92, 94, and 96 are two-<br>
dimensional flux tables, similar to those used for decoupling in a saturated<br>
motor. It is assumed that the permanent-magnet flux is separable from<br>
the d-axis flux table , and it is also assumed that q-axis flux is independent<br>
of the permanent magnet flux. Flux table blocks 92 and 94 are from the same<br>
d-axis table, and the d-axis flux is assumed to be the permanent magnet flux<br><br>
when there is no d-axis current, as is determined by flux table block 94. As<br>
indicated in FIG. 6, the synchronous frame currents, , are<br>
received by the flux table blocks 92, 94, and 96 to generate the flux in the d-<br>
axis and the q-axis. The d-axis flux is generated by flux table block 92, from<br>
which the permanent magnet flux is subtracted at summer 98, resulting in the<br>
d-axis winding flux  . The q-axis winding flux   is directly<br>
obtained from flux table block 96. In one embodiment, the winding fluxes<br>
  determined by the flux table blocks 92, 94, and 96 are<br>
assumed to be measured fluxes. Estimated fluxes, , are then<br>
subtracted from the measured winding fluxes,  , at summers<br>
100 and 102, respectively. The resulting flux errors,  , are<br>
used to drive the flux observer 68 as described below.<br>
[0047] FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a flux estimation portion 104 and a BEMF<br>
estimation portion 106, respectively, of the flux observer 68. Referring to<br>
both FIGS. 7 and 8, the flux estimation portion 104 and the BEMF estimation<br>
portion 106 include flux observer gain blocks 108-118, sampling time blocks<br>
120, delay blocks 122, and summers 124-134 .<br>
[0048] As shown in FIG. 7, the flux estimation portion 104 receives the<br>
flux increments, and  from the motor model block 64 and<br>
the flux errors,   from the flux model block 66. The flux<br>
errors are multiplied by flux observer gains, , at the flux observer gain<br>
blocks 108-114 and added at summers 124 and 126, respectively. The outputs<br>
of the summers 124 and 126 are multiplied by the sampling time at sampling<br>
time blocks 114 before being sent to summers 128 and 130. The flux<br>
increments, , are also received by summers 128 and 130,<br>
respectively, to contribute to the correction of the estimated winding fluxes,<br>
  which are fed back into the summers 128 and 130 after<br>
being delayed one PWM cycle by the delays blocks 122.<br><br>
[0049] As shown in FIG. 8, in one embodiment, the BEMF estimation<br>
portion 106 uses only the flux errors, and , to build up the BEMF<br>
estimations,   The flux errors,   are<br>
multiplied by flux observer gains, , along with the sampling time, Ts, at<br>
flux observer gain blocks 116 and 118 before being received by summers 132<br>
and 134, respectively. The BEMF estimations,  , are fed<br>
back into the summers 132 and 134 after being delayed one PWM cycle by the<br>
delay blocks 122.<br>
[0050] FIG. 9 illustrates a portion of a PWM signal 136 generated by the<br>
controller 46 and used to control the motor 40, according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The portion of the PWM signal 136 includes a first<br>
cycle 138, a second cycle 140, and a third cycle 142. Although the cycles in<br>
the signal 136 generally follow a sequential order (i.e., k-1, k, k+1, etc.), for<br>
illustrative purposes, the third cycle 142 is described as occurring immediately<br>
before the first cycle 138, and the first cycle 138 is described as occurring<br>
immediately before the second cycle 140.<br>
[0051] The digital controller 46 has an inherent one-cycle delay caused by<br>
the PWM, which may result in the error of control and estimation. FIG. 9<br>
illustrates an example of the timing of PWM and current sampling used in the<br>
motor drive system, according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The voltage applied to the motor 40 during the first (or k-th) cycle 138 is<br>
calculated during the third (or (k-l)-th) cycle 142. For each cycle, the new<br>
voltage is applied at the beginning thereof, and at the same time, the motor<br>
current is sampled. For example, at the beginning of the first cycle 138, the<br>
motor current may be represented as   The voltage applied to build ia (k)<br>
is the voltage applied during the third (or (k-l)-th) cycle 142,<br>
which is calculated during the (k-2)-th cycle (not shown).<br>
[0052] As such, a two-cycle delay occurs between a commanded voltage<br>
and the observance of that commanded voltage by the flux observer 68.<br><br>
Additionally, although every variable besides stationary voltage may be<br>
updated as shown in FIG. 9 (i.e., at the beginning of each cycle), the actual<br>
average voltage sought by the PWM signal 136 occurs at the mid-point of<br>
each cycle (or sampling period). This results in a delay of the voltage angle of<br>
the motor 40.<br>
[0053] FIGS. 10 and 11 illustrate a voltage transformation portion 144 and<br>
a current transformation portion 146, respectively, of the coordinate<br>
conversion block 70. The voltage transformation portion 144 shown in FIG.<br>
10 includes delay blocks 148, a voltage compensation block 150, a summer<br>
152, and a coordinate conversion block 154. As shown, the stationary<br>
voltages, and   are received, and delayed two-cycles (i.e.,  ), by the<br>
delay blocks 148 to account for the two-cycle lag between commanded<br>
voltages and the observance of the associated flux and then sent to the<br>
coordinate conversion block 154. The voltage compensation block 150<br>
compensates for the delay of the voltage angle and is proportional to the<br>
operating speed. Summer 152 subtracts the estimated position from the output<br>
of the voltage compensation block 150 and sends its output to the coordinate<br>
conversion block 154. The coordinate conversion block 154 changes the<br>
stationary voltages, and into the synchronous voltages, and <br>
[0054] The current transformation portion 146 shown in FIG. 11 includes<br>
a current compensation block 156, a summer 158, and a conversion block 160.<br>
The current compensation block 156, in one embodiment, is used to<br>
compensate for a delay caused from use an analog filter.<br>
[0055] FIG. 12 illustrates the speed and position observer block 72 in<br>
greater detail. The speed and position observer 72 includes a BEMF limiter<br>
block 162, a position error block 164, gain blocks 166, 168, and 170, delay<br>
blocks 172, sampling time blocks 174, a position limiter block 176, and<br>
summers 178-186. The gain blocks 166-170 determine the dynamic<br>
behavior of the speed and position observer 72. If there is   of position<br>
error, then the estimated BEMF are approximated as<br><br><br>
[0056] At low speeds,  may be too low to be used and thus may be<br>
limited by the BEMF limiter block 162 below a certain speed depending on<br>
the magnetic flux of the motor 40. The position error block 164 extracts the<br>
position error in Equations 1 and 2 utilizing, in one embodiment, a two-<br>
dimensional arc-tangent function. The resultant position error is used<br>
to generate the estimation of electrical motor speed for the next cycle<br>
  as shown in FIG. 12. The position limiter block 176 limits the<br>
integrated value of the estimation of the position for the next cycle <br>
within ±180° of the electrical angle. The estimated position and speed are to<br>
be used for the next sampling period to meet the timing sequence. The<br>
estimated motor speed is used in place of in FIGS. 1-11. It is also used<br>
to calculate gains in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8.<br>
[0057] Except at low speeds where the absolute value of Esq is limited by<br>
the BEMF limiter block 162, the position error block 164 provides a robust<br>
signal to track the position and speed of the motor irrespective of the<br>
magnitude of the permanent magnet, which is affected by the operating<br>
temperature, and the operating speed. Thus, it is possible to estimate the<br>
position and speed of the motor 40 regardless of the operating conditions of<br>
the motor 40.<br>
[0058] FIG. 13 illustrates a sensorless electric motor drive system 188<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. The motor drive<br>
system includes a current controller 190, rotational transformation blocks 192<br>
and 194, a phase conversion block 196, the power inverter 34 (including a<br><br>
two-to-three phase conversion block and a PWM generation block), the motor<br>
40, the position and speed estimator 62, and summers 198-204.<br>
[0059] A torque command is sent from a high level controller, such as a<br>
torque controller or vehicle controller. The torque command is transformed<br>
into current commands, and , which are DC quantities.<br>
[0060] Phase conversion block 196 transforms three-phase currents<br>
sampled from the motor 40 into two-phase currents. The rotational<br>
transformation block 194 provides the rotational transformation (e.g.,<br>
stationary to synchronous frames) with respect to the rotor position obtained<br>
from the proposed invention in order to change the two-phase AC currents,<br>
  and , into two-phase DC currents,and which   are used as<br>
current feedback at summers 198 and 200.<br>
[0061] The difference between the current command and the current<br>
feedback drives the current controller 190 to generate the voltage commands,<br>
  and   which are also DC quantities. At summers 202 and 204,<br>
feedforward terms (or decoupling voltages)  and   are used to<br>
decouple the voltage induced by the flux inside the motor at the output of the<br>
current controller 190. The feedforward terms are calculated from the flux<br>
table,  and , as<br><br>
[0062]	Although the commanded currents may be used in Equations 3<br>
and 4, the decoupling voltages calculated using the commanded currents may<br>
result in oscillatory current control response at high speed operation.<br>
[0063] As mentioned earlier, three-phase AC voltage is usually used to<br>
drive the motor, so an inverse-rotational transform (e.g., synchronous to<br>
stationary frames) from  and to   and   with respect to the rotor<br><br>
position is performed by rotational transformation block 192. These two-<br>
phase AC voltage commands, and , are then transformed into three-<br>
phase AC quantities by the inverter 34.<br>
[0064] As described above, the position and speed estimator 62 uses the<br>
outputs of rotational transformation block 192 and the phase conversion block<br>
196 to estimate the flux and the BEMF.<br>
[0065] FIG. 14 graphically illustrates the root locus of a prior art<br>
sensorless motor control system as the motor speed changes. As shown, some<br>
of the poles 206 lie to the right of the imaginary axis (vertical axis), which<br>
results in system instability as the motor speed increases. In prior art systems,<br>
it is sometimes necessary to place the poles of the flux observer and the<br>
current controller to be moved toward the left side in order to avoid such<br>
unstable poles as the motor speed increases.<br>
[0066] FIG. 15 graphically illustrates the root locus of a sensorless motor<br>
control system according to an embodiment of the present invention at the<br>
same operating speed as that of FIG. 14. The poles 208 move according to the<br>
operating speed (shown between 10,000 and 120,000 r/min) but do not cross<br>
the imaginary axis even at 120,000 r/min. Therefore, the stability of the<br>
system is improved. Additionally, the locations of the poles is nearly<br>
unaffected by the operating speed. Thus, it is possible to increase the<br>
bandwidth over the wide range of the operating speed without losing the<br>
stability, which further improves performance of the sensorless control<br>
system.<br>
[0067] Other embodiments may utilize the method and system described<br>
above in implementations other than automobiles, such as watercraft and<br>
aircraft. The electric motor and the power inverter may have different<br>
numbers of phases, such as two or four. Other forms of power sources may be<br>
used, such as current sources and loads including diode rectifiers, thyristor<br>
converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors, and/or any combination thereof.<br>
