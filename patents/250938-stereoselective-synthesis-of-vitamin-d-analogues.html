FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of producing calcipotriol {(5Z, 7E, 22E, 24S)-<br>
24-cyclopropyl-9,10-secochola-5,7,10(19),22-tetraene-la-3|3-24-triol} or calcipotriol<br>
monohydrate by stereoselective reduction. The present invention further provides novel<br>
intermediates and methods for the synthesis of the intermediates useful for producing<br>
calcipotriol or calcipotriol monohydrate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Calcipotriol or calcipotriene (structure I) [CAS 112965-21-6] shows a strong activity in<br>
inhibiting undesirable proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes [F.A.C.M. Castelijins, MJ.<br>
Gerritsen, I.M.J.J. van Viijmen-Willems, PJ. van Erp, P.C.M. van de Kerkhof; Acta Derm.<br>
Venereol. 79, 11, 1999]. The efficiency of calcipotriol and calcipotriol monohydrate (II)<br>
in the treatment of psoriasis was shown in a number of clinical trials [D.M. Ashcroft et<br>
Brit. Med. J. 320, 963-67, 2000] and calcipotriol is" currently used in several<br>
commercial drug formulations.<br>
In the preparation of calcipotriol, the specific stereochemistry for the hydroxyl group at<br>
C-24 is necessary for full expression of the biological activity. Under current<br>
methodology, the required stereochemistry is introduced by one of the following<br>
methods:The non-diastereoseiective reduction of C-24 keto-trienes followed by chromatographic separation of the epimeric<br>
mixture (i) is the most widely practiced procedure for obtaining the desired epimer. This reduction process yields<br>
mainly the undesired C-24 epimeric alcohol (typically about 60% of the unwanted 24-R epimer) and it is difficult to<br>
separate the desired S-epimer from such a mixture by chromatography on a production scale.<br>
The stereoselective synthesis (ii) is still an unfavourable process for scale up due to its multi step nature and cost<br>
and due to the fact that toxic intermediates are used.<br>
The enzymatic esterification process (ifi) has the disadvantage, apart from the high cost of the enzymes employed,<br>
that it introduces^ depending on the selectivity of the enzyme,  1-2 additional reaction steps which adds even<br>
further costs to the process.<br>
The stereoselective reduction of C-24 ketones directly to the desired C-24 hydroxyl epimers has for example been described for choiesteroi derivatives in WO 98/24800 and by M. Ishiguro et ai., J. C. S. Chem. Comm., 115-117, 1981. The stereoselective reduction of a side chain triple bond analogue of calcipotriol with unprotected triene system using S-alpine borane has been described by by M. 1 Calveriy et al. in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1841-1844, 3(9), 1993.<br>
A major technical problem of using stereoselective reduction methods for the synthesis of calcipotriol stems from the fact that the unsaturated triene system of hitherto known intermediates for the synthesis of calcipotriol are chemically labile, such as towards Lewis acidic conditions, that they are relatively easily oxidised, and that they are usually not compatible with the typical reduction reaction conditions employed. This results in reduced yields, impure products and tedious work-up procedures, especially on large-scale.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide an alternative process for the synthesis of calcipotriol, which may overcome one or more of the various problems and disadvantages described above.<br>
The present invention provides a novel process to produce diastereomericaliy enriched C-24 hydroxyl epimers of calcipotriol derivatives using a novel synthetic pathway comprising a stereoselective reduction step. The present invention further provides novel chemically more stable intermediates where the labile triene system is protected as sulphur dioxide adduct. By producing diastereomericaliy enriched C-24 hydroxyl epimers" of calcipotriol derivatives the yield and the efficacy of the subsequent separation of the desired C-24 S-hydroxyl epimer may be greatly improved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein a "hydroxy protecting group" is any group which forms a derivative that is stable to the projected reactions wherein said hydroxy protecting group can be selectively removed by reagents that do not attack the regenerated hydroxy group.<br>
Said derivative can be obtained by selective reaction of a hydroxy protecting agent with a hydroxy group. Silyl derivatives, such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl forming silyl ethers are examples of hydroxy protecting groups. Silyl chlorides such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCI), trimethylsilylchloride, triethylsilylchloride, diphenylmethylsilylchloride, triisopropylsilylchloride, and tert-butyldiphenylsilylchloride are examples of hydroxy protecting agents. Hydrogen fluoride, such as aqueous HF in acetonitrile, or tetra n-butylammonium fluoride are examples of reagents which can remove silyl groups. Other hydroxy protecting groups include ethers, such as tetrahydropyranyl (THP) ether, including alkoxyalkyl ethers (acetals), such as methoxymethyl (MOM) ether, or esters, such as chloroacetate ester, trimethylacetate, acetate or benzoate ester. Non-limiting examples of hydroxy<br><br>
 protecting groups and methods of protection and removal, all included in the scope of this application, can for example be found in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd ed., T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts eds., John Wiley 1999 and in "Protecting Groups", 1st ed., PJ. Kocienski, G. Thieme 2000.<br>
As used herein, "alkyl" is intented to mean a linear or branched alkyl group, which may be cyclic or acyclic, having one to twenty carbon atoms, preferably one to seven carbon atoms.

As used herein, "inert solvent" means any organic solvent compatible with said reducing agent under the reaction conditions employed, or mixtures of such solvents. The choice of such solvent will depend on the specific reducing agent used. Non-limiting examples of inert solvents include hydrocarbons, such as toluene, and ethers, such as tert-butyl methyl ether or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
A mixture of compounds of general structure IVa and IVb, which is enriched with IVa, means a mixture, optionally comprising other compounds or solvents, were the molar ratio (diastereomer ratio) of IVa/IVb is one (50:50) or larger than one, thus that the mixture contains at least 50% of the compound of general structure IVa (containing 50% or less of the compound of.general structure IVb).<br>
A mixture of compounds of general structure Va and: Vb, which is enriched with Va, means a mixture, optionally comprising other compounds or solvents, were the molar ratio (diastereomer ratio) of Va/Vb is one (50:50) or larger than one, thus that the mixture contains at least 50% of the compound of general structure Va (containing 50% or less of the compound of general structure Vb).<br>

Suitable solvents for the Diels-Alder reaction are all solvents, which are compatible with the reaction conditions, such as alkanes, such as hexane or heptane, hydrocarbons, such as xylenes, toluene, ethers, such as diethyl ether or methyl-rerr-butyl ether (MTBE), acetates, such as ethyl acetate or 2-propyl acetate, halogenated solvents such as dichloromethane, or mixtures of said solvents. In a preferred embodiment the solvent is toluene. In another preferred embodiment the solvent is a mixture of a water immiscible solvent and water, such as toluene and water. The reaction can also be carried out in neat sulphur dioxide without a solvent. A suitable reaction temperature of the process is -50°C to 60 °C, such as -30°C to 50°C, such as -15°C to 40°C, such as -5°C to 30°C, such as 0°C to 35°C, such as 5°C to 30°C most such as 10°C to 25°C, such as 15°C to 20°C. In one embodiment the sulphur dioxide is used in excess (mol/mol), such as 5-100 molar excess, such as 7-30 molar excess, such as 10-15 molar excess. Any excess of unreacted sulphur dioxide may be removed from the reaction mixture by e.g. washing with aqueous base, such as aqueous sodium hydroxide or by distilling the sulphur dioxide off, optionally together with a solvent, optionally under reduced<br><br>
pressure. The compounds of general structure III are usually obtained as a mixture of their epimers Ilia and Illb.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The molar ratio Illa/IIIb of the mixture of the epimers obtained in the Diets-Alder reaction will depend on the groups X, R1 and R2 and the reaction conditions used. The present invention includes mixtures of all possible compositions (molar ratio Illa/IIIb), such as 1:99, such as 2:98, such as 3:97, such as 4:96, such as 5:95, such as 10:90, such as 85:15, such as 80:20, such as 75:25, such as 30:70, such as 35:65, such as 40:60, such as 45:55, such as 50:50, such as 55:45, such as 60:40, such as 65:35, such as 70:30, such as 75:25, such as 80: 20, such as 85:10, such as 90:10, such as 95:5, such as 96:4, such as 97:3, such as 98:2, such as 99:1. The general formula III includes mixtures of all possible compositions (molar ratio Illa/IIIb) as above. In an embodiment of the present invention, compounds IlIa and Illb are used as a mixture, as indicated in the general formula III in the following reduction step. The mixture of Ilia and Illb may optionally be purified or separated, such as by chromatography or crystallisation. In another embodiment compound IlIa is used in the following reduction step. In yet another embodiment compound Illb is used in the following reduction step.<br>
Compounds of general structure VII can for example be synthesised according to methods disclosed for example by M. J. Calverley, Tetrahedron, Vol. 4.3, No. 20, pp. 4609-4619, 1987 or in WO 87/00834 and references cited therein. For example, compound VII, wherein X is OR2 and both Rx and R2 are tert-butyldimethylsilyl which is described in these references can be deprotected with aqueous hydrofluoric acid in acetonitrile to give a mixture of compounds wherein X is OR2 and either Ra or R2 are hydrogen, or to give a compound wherein X is OR2 and Ri and R2are both hydrogen. This mixture of compounds can for example be separated by chromatography or crystallised as generally described herein. By reaction of said compounds of general structure VII, wherein R1 and/or R2 are hydrogen with a suitable protecting agent, new groups R1 and/or R2 can be introduced. Depending on the stoichiometry of the protecting agent used and the reaction conditions, mixtures of unprotected, monoprotected, and diprotected compounds can be obtained. Any intermediate of a mixture wherein X is OR2 and one of Rx or R2 is hydrogen can then be isolated by chromatography and reacted with suitable protecting agent different from the first one used, to give compounds of general structure VII, wherein X is OR2 and R1 is different from R2. Compounds of general structure VII wherein X is hydrogen and R1 is hydrogen or a hydroxy protecting group can for example be prepared starting from compound 7a and/or 7b described by M. J. Calverley, Tetrahedron, Vol. 43, No. 20, p. 4610, 1987 and following analogues procedures and general synthetic methods as above and as described in the above cited references.<br>
The reducing process of the present invention can for example be carried out by reacting a prochiral ketone of general structure III   with a chiral borane reducing agent or a borane reducing agent in the presence of a chiral<br><br>
auxiliary. The process results in the enantioselective/diastereoselective reduction of the prochiral ketone, such that one of the two possible epimers IVa or IVb is formed in preference to the corresponding epimer. The degree of enantioselectivity/diastereoselectivity will depend on the reducing agent used, the chiral auxiliary and the reaction conditions.<br>
The reduction reaction of a compound of general structure III is usually carried out in a temperature interval between -80°C to 70 °C, such as -40°C to 60°C, such as -15°C to 50°C, such as -5°C to 40°C, e.g. 0°C to 5°C or 5°C to 35°C. In one embodiment the remperature interval is between 10°C to 30°C, such as 15°C to 25°C, such as 15°C to 20°C The optimum temperature will depend on the specific reaction condition and reagents used. In one embodiment of the present invention, the reaction mixture is immediately cooled to 0-10°C after completion to avoid the formation of by-products, IF N,N-diethylaniline is used as reducing aoent, theN,N-diethylaniline formed can be easily removed from the reaction mixture by extraction with  aqoeous hydrochloric acid. One meter equivalent with respect to the base to be extracted of 1M hydrochloric acid is preferred.<br>
The reducing agent, optionally dissolved or mixed with an inert solvent, may be added to the compound of general structure III optionally dissolved or mixed with an inert solvent, e.g. under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen. Alternatively the compound of general structure III, optionally dissolved or mixed with an inert solvent, may be added to the reducing agent, optionally dissolved or mixed with an inert solvent (reversed order). In one embodiment of the present invention, the reducing agent is used in an equimolar amount or in molar excess to a compound of general structure III. In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio of reducing agent/ compound of general structure III is 1.0-5.0. In a presently preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of reducing agent/compound of general structure III is 1.8-3.0, such as 2.3-2.9, such as 2.5-2.7.<br>
The chiral auxiliary may react with the reducing agent prior to the reduction in situ to form a chiral reducing agent or the chiral auxiliary may for example serve as a chiral ligand in a complex with the reducing agent, i.e. for example to give a chiral reducing agent. The present invention includes the use of such chiral reducing agents or chiral ligand-reducing agent complexes, which were prepared and isolated separately before being used for the reduction of a compound of general structure III.<br>
.The term "reducing agent in the presence of a chiral auxiliary" thus includes any chiral reducing agent. For example, the chiral auxiliary may react with a borane reducing agent prior to the reduction in situ to form a chiral borane reducing agent or the chiral auxiliary may serve as a chiral ligand in a borane complex. Examples of such chiral borane reducing agents are chiral oxaborolidines or oxazaborolidines, such as chiral oxazaborolidine reagents derived from (lR,2S)-c/s-l-amino-2-indanol, (lS,2R)-c/'s-l-amino-2-indanol, (S)-prolinol, (R)-prolinol or B-(3-pinanyl)-9-borabicyclo[3.3.2]nonane (alpine-borane), or e.g. 5,5-diphenyl-2-methyl-3,4-propano-l,3,2-oxazaborolidine, (S)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine, (R)-2-methyl-CBS-oxazaborolidine. The present invention therefore includes the use of such chiral reducing agents, such as chiral borane reducing agents, or chiral ligand-reducing agent complexes, such as chiral ligand-borane complexes, which were prepared and isolated before being used for the reduction of a compound of general structure III.<br>
Another example of a chiral ligand in a complex with the reducing agent is the complex of LiAIH4 and 2,2'-dihydroxy-l,l'binaphthyl.<br>
The molar ratio of reducing agent/chiral auxiliary is typically in the range of 0.1-20.0, such as 0.4-10.0, such as 0.3-5.0, such as 0.5-4.5, such as 1.0-4.0, such as 1.9-3.1, such as 2.1-2.9, such as 2.3-2.7, e.g. 10.8, 5.4, 2.6, 2.5, or 1.6.<br><br>
The chiral auxiliary may be present in catalytic amounts, such as substoichiometric, or equimolar or in molar excess referring to a compound of general structure III or to the reducing agent. E.g. the ratio of chiral auxiliary/compound III may be 0.25-2.5, such as 0.5-2.0, such as 0.8-1.3, such as 0.9-1.2, such as 1.0-1.1.<br>
The selection of a particular enantiomer of the chiral auxiliary will determine the stereoselective orientation of the hydroxy group of the compound of general structure IV with respect to C-24. Chiral auxiliaries which predominantly yield the S-configuration at C-24 are preferred.<br>
Borane-catalysed reactions were for example reviewed by Deloux and Srebnik [Chem. Rev. 93, 763, 1993]. Examples of efficient catalysts based on chiral modified borane can for example be found in [A. Hirao, J. Chem. Soe Chem. Commun. 315, 1981; EJ. Corey, J. Am. Chem. Soc. M)9, 7925, 1987T.<br>

The methods for producing calcipotriol as described herein may be modified with regard to the order of the reaction steps, by omitting one or more reaction steps, or by introducing additional purification or reaction steps at any stage of the reaction sequence. The present invention includes all such modifications.<br>
The method for producing calcipotriol as described herein includes further all variants, where the hydroxy protecting groups R1 and/or R2 for compounds or intermediates, where R1 and/or R2 are not hydrogen, are removed at any stage of the reaction sequence. Compounds or intermediates, wherein R1 and/or R2 are hydrogen may be protected with protecting agents at any stage of the reaction sequence, including protecting agents which yield different protecting groups than those removed earlier in the reaction sequence.<br>
Compounds and intermediates of the present invention may comprise asymmetrically substituted (chiral) carbon<br>
atoms and carbon-carbon double bonds which may give rise to the existence of isomeric forms, e.g. enantiomers,<br>
diastereomers and geometric isomers.<br>
Epimers are known as diastereomers that have opposite configuration (R or S) at<br>
only one of multiple tetrahedral stereogenic centres in molecules having multiple stereogenic centres, such as the<br>
vitamin D analogues to which the present invention is directed.<br>
Designation of, for example, C-24 as the epimeric centre of a pair of enantiomers therefore implies that the<br>
configuration at the other stereogenic centres of the pair are identical.<br>
The present invention relates to all isomeric forms, such as epimers, either in pure form or as mixtures thereof.<br>
The indication of a specific conformation or configuration either in the formulas or the names of compounds or<br>
intermediates of the present invention shall indicate that this specific conformation or configuration is a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention. The indication of a specific conformation or configuration either in the formulas or<br>
the names of compounds or intermediates of the present invention shall include any other isomer than specifically<br>
indicated, either in pure form or as mixtures thereof, as another embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
The indication of an unspecific conformation or configuration either in the formulas or the names of compounds or<br>
Intermediates   of the   present  invention   shall   indicate  that  a   mixture   of  these  specific  conformations   or<br>
configurations is a preferred embodiment of the invention. For example, the compound of general formula III is a<br>
mixture of the epimers of general formula IlIa and Illb.<br>
The indication of an unspecific conformation or configuration either in the formulas or the names or numbering of<br>
compounds or intermediates of the present invention shall include any specific isomer although not specifically<br>
indicated in pure form, e.g. as another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
For example, the compound of general formula IVa includes the following two epimers IVaa and IVab.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The meaning of compound of general formula III thus includes epimers IlIa and Illb.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and the intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of procedures known in the art, such as by chromatography or crystallisation, or by stereoselective synthesis.<br>
The separation, isolation, and purification methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to chromatography, such as adsorption chromatography (including column chromatography and simulated moving bed (SMB)), crystallisation, or distillation. The separation, isolation, and purification methods may be used subsequently and in combination.<br>
Column chromatography, useful for the separation of vitamin D analogues of the present invention is well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical chemistry. The technique employs a column packed with a stationary phase, for example silica, such as pretreated silica onto which sample to be separated is loaded. The sample is then eluted with a suitable eluent. Elution can be isocratic or so-called solvent programmed (gradient), wherein the composition of the eluent is varied regularly (e.g. linearly) or irregularly (e.g. stepwise over time. Pretreated silica gel, well known to a person skilled in the art of chromatography, is a suitable stationary phase. Elution with 5% (v:v) ethyl acetate in hexane or heptane followed by neat ethyl acetate is but one example of an elution program that produces the desired separation. Other suitable eluents will be deduced by the skilled person through routine methods of development, e.g. by using mixtures of heptane and ethylacetate of suitable polarity. For the chromatography step, any combination of stationary phase (packing) and eluent that is capable of resolving the mixture of C-24 epimers can be used. Such combinations can be readily determined by the skilled person by routine experimentation. An example of a preferred stationary phase is silica, such as treated silica.<br><br>

In one embodiment of the present invention, the temperature range of extractions and phase separations after the completion of the retro Diels-AJder reaction during reaction work-up are about 30°G-40°C. Compounds of general structure VIII can be obtained by isomerisation of compounds of general structure VIL Methods for the isomerisation of compounds of general formula Va and/or Vb to Via and/or VIb, or VII to VIII, are well known to a person skilled in the art of vitamin D synthesis. Reaction conditions can e.g. be found in M. J. Calverley, Tetrahedron, Vol. 43, No. 20, pp. 4609-4619, 1987 or in WO 87/00834 and references cited therein. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the isomerisation is a photo isomerisation, e.g. with UV-light in the presence of a triplet sensitizer, e.g. anthracene or 9-acetylanthracene.<br>
Compounds of general formula III, IV, V, VI, or VII, wherein X = hydrogen may be hydroxylated with a suitable hydroxylating agent, for example by a selenite mediated allylic hydroxylation, under the conditions developed by Hesse, e.g. with Se02 and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide in refluxing methanol and/or dichloromethane) [D.R. Andrews et al., J. Org. Chem., 1986, 51, 1637) or as described in M. J. Calverley, Tetrahedron, Vol. 43, No. 20, pp. 4609-4619, 1987 or in WO 87/00834, to give compounds of general formula III, IV, V, VI, or VII, wherein X = hydroxy (X=OR2 and R2 = hydrogen). The hydroxy groups of the starting materials may be protected with suitable protecting groups such as defined above by methods such as described above, for example to avoid undesired oxidation of said hydroxy groups.<br>
Calcipotriol hydrate may be obtained by crystallisation of calcipotriol from aqueous solvents, such as for example by methods described in WO 94/15912.<br>
