				<td>METHOD OF PREPARING ESOMEPRAZOLE AND SALTS THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing optically pure esomeprazole, and its salt, from omeprazole by applying an improved optical resolution process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Esomeprazole of formula (II), the levorotatory isomer of racemic omeprazole, is an ulcer treating agent which is very effective in treating such disorders as gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer and reflux esophagitis, which is less influenced by liver metabolism, exerting less adverse effect, as compared to the omeprazole racemate. It is now commercially available in the form of Nexium<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Various methods of preparing esomeprazole are described in the literatures, e.g., US Patent Nos. 5,693,818 and 6,369,085, International Publication Patent Nos. WO 1996/002535, WO 1997/002261 and WO 2004002982, Chinese Patent No. 1,087,739, [J. Deng et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 11, 1729-1732, 2000] and [H. Cotton et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, II, 3319-3825, 2000]. Among these methods, preferred in terms of commercial applicability are methods which involve resolving racemic omeprazole using an optical resolution agent or asymmetrically oxidizing a precursor of esomeprazole using a chiral reagent.<br>
For example, Chinese Patent No. 1,087.739 discloses a method of preparing esomeprazole of formula (II) by way of reacting the racemic form of<br><br>
omeprazole with (S)-(-)-binol (a levorotatory isomer of ß -binaphthol) as an optical resolution agent to form the inclusion complex of esomeprazole and (S)-(-)-binol of formula (I), and removing the (S)-(-)-binol moiety therefrom:<br>
(FormulaRemoved) <br><br><br>
However, this method has several problems in that;<br>
1)	for the purpose of obtaining esomeprazole of a high optical purity,<br>
relatively expensive (S)-(-)-binol must be used in an excess amount of 1.5 mole<br>
equivalents based on omeprazole.<br>
2)	benzene (Class I; ICH Q3C Impurities:  Guideline for Residual<br>
Solvents (CPMP/ICH/283/95)) which has potential to instigate toxicity is used as<br>
a solvent in the method,<br>
3)	the inclusion complex of formula (I), and also the solution containing<br>
same are colored pitch-black, which requires a decolorization step in the recycling<br>
of unreacted (S)-(-)-binol isolated from the reaction mixture containing the<br>
inclusion complex,<br>
4)	the removal of (S)-(-)-binol from the inclusion complex of formula (1)<br>
is performed by chromatography, which is not suitable for mass production, and<br>
5)	the  optical purity  of the inclusion complex  of formula (I)  is<br>
unsatisfactorily low, i.e., about 90% ee(enantiomeric excess), which necessitates<br>
further purification of the final esomeprazole product, causing a lowering of the<br>
yield ([J. Deng et al., Tetrahedron: Asymmetry,11, 1729-1732, 2000]).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved optical resolution process for preparing optically pure esomeprazole and its salt.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br><br>
a method of preparing esomeprazole of formula (II) or its salt having an optical purity of at least 98% ee, which comprises:<br>
(A)	dissolving (S)-(-)-binol, a weak base and the racemic form of<br>
omeprazole in a mixture of a water-compatible organic solvent and water at a<br>
temperature ranging from 30 to 70°C, and cooling the resulting solution to a<br>
temperature of -5 °C to room temperature to allow the crystallization of the<br>
inclusion complex of esomeprazole and (S)-(-)-binol of formula (I); and<br>
(B)	removing the (S)-(-)-binol moiety from the inclusion complex of<br>
formula (I) obtained in step (A) by filtration or extraction:<br><br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention taken in conjunction with the following accompanying drawings, which respectively show:<br>
FIG. 1 : photographs of the esomeprazole/(S)-(-)-binol inclusion complexes obtained in Example 1 and Comparative Example 3, respectively; and<br>
FIG. 2 : visible-ray absorption spectra of the esomeprazole/(S)-(-)-binol inclusion complexes obtained in Example 1, Comparative Example 2 and Comparative Example 3, respectively.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Step (A) in accordance with the present invention comprises dissolving (S)-(-)-binol as an optical resolution agent, a weak base and the racemic form of omeprazole in a mixture of a water-compatible organic solvent and water at a temperature ranging from 30 to 70 °C, and then allowing the mixed solution to cool to a temperature of-5°C to room temperature, preferably of 0 to 15°C, to crystallize the inclusion complex of esomeprazole and (S)-(-)-binol of formula (I).<br>
The (S)-(-)-binol optical resolution agent may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 0.7 mole equivalent based on omeprazole, which is much less than that used in conventional optical resolution processes.<br>
The weak base used in the present invention prevents the inclusion complex of formula (I) from turning black and representative examples thereof include ammonium hydroxide, methylamine, ethylamine, dimethylamine, diethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine and a mixture thereof. The weak base may be used in an amount ranging from 0.05 to 1 mole equivalent, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 mole equivalent, based on omeprazole.<br>
The water-compatible organic solvent-water mixture used in the present invention may comprise the organic solvent and water in a volume ratio of 98-40 : 2~60. If necessary, additional water may be added to the mixed solvent just before cooling so long as the final mixture satisfies the above-mentioned volume ratio. The water-compatible organic solvent, which is non-toxic, may be methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, acetone, acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane or a mixture thereof (Class II or III; ICH Q3C Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents (CPMP/ICH/283/95)), which may be used in an amount of 3 to 15 ml based on 1 g of omeprazole.<br>
The esomeprazole; (S)-(-)-binol inclusion complex of formula (I) crystallized by cooling may be obtained in a crystalline powder form through the conventional filtering or drying method. The white or white-yellow crystalline inclusion complex thus obtained has a satisfactory optical purity of at least 95% ee, which does not require further purification, but, if necessary, it may be further recrystallized from a mixture of a water-compatible organic<br><br>
solvent and water to further improve its purity.<br>
Step (B) in accordance with the present invention comprises removing the (S)-(-)-binol moiety from the inclusion complex of formula (I) obtained in step (A) by filtration or extraction to obtain esomeprazole of formula (II) or its salt.<br>
Specifically, in step (B), esomeprazole of formula (II) or its salt may be obtained by suspending the inclusion complex of formula (I) in water or alcohol and adding a base thereto, followed by filtration or extraction with an organic solvent, to separate the (S)-(-)-binol moiety from the inclusion complex. This step (B) may be performed at room temperature.<br>
When the inclusion complex of formula (I) is suspended in water, as the base, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide may be used in an amount ranging from 1 to 1.5 mole equivalents, preferably from 1 to 1.2 mole equivalents, based on the inclusion complex. In this case, (S)-(-)-binol is isolated in the subsequent filtration or extraction step and esomeprazole of formula (II) or its salt may be recovered from the alkaline filtrate by the conventional methods. For example, esomeprazole may be recovered by acidifying the filtrate using acetic acid, followed by filtration or extraction with an organic solvent: sodium or potassium salt of esomeprazole, by concentrating the filtrate and adding an organic solvent to the concentrate to induce the crystallization of the desired product, or by acidifying the filtrate using acetic acid, extracting it with an organic solvent and adding sodium or potassium hydroxide to the resulting organic layer to induce the crystallization of the desired product; and magnesium salt of esomeprazole, by adding an aqueous magnesium chloride solution to the filtrate containing sodium or potassium salt of esomeprazole, or to an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium salt of esomeprazole previously obtained, to induce the crystallization of the desired product.<br>
On the other hand, when the inclusion complex of formula (I) is suspended in alcohol such as methanol, ethanol and isopropanol. strontium hydroxide is suitable for use as the base and it may be used in an amount ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 mole equivalent, preferably from 0.5 to 0.6 mole equivalent, based on the inclusion complex. In this case, strontium salt of esomeprazole is directly isolated in the subsequent filtration or extraction step and (S)-(-)-binoI may be recovered from the alkaline filtrate for further recycling by the<br>
conventional methods. For example, (S)-(-)-binol may be recovered by adding water to the filtrate, followed by filtration.<br>
The organic solvent suitable for use in the extraction step may be methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, ethyl ether, dichloromethane, chloroform or a mixture thereof.<br>
The (S)-(-)-binol thus isolated may be recovered in a yield of 85% or higher. As it is not colored black, it may be reused in the preparation of the inclusion complex of formula (I) via a simple purification procedure including a recrystallization step.<br><br>
Esomeprazole or its salt obtained in accordance with the inventive method has a high optical purity of at least 98% ee. which meets the minimum pharmaceutical purity required by US Pharmacopoeia.<br>
As described above, the method of the present invention can be advantageously used for simple and economical preparation of optically pure esomeprazole and its salt, without the problem of coloration which prevents the recycling of (S)-(-)-binol optical resolution agent.<br>
The following Examples are given for the purpose of illustration only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The optical purities of the respective esomeprazole/(S)-(-)-binol inclusion complexes, and esomeprazole and its salt, obtained in the following Examples and Comparative Examples were determined by chiral HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) under the conditions lifted below:<br>
-	column: Chiral-AGP (5 µn, 150 mm x 4 mm)<br>

-	flow rate: 0.8 ml/min<br>

(S)-(-)-binol and 10.0 g of the racemic form of omeprazole were dissolved in a mixture of 288 ml of benzene and 72 ml of n-hexane at 110°C. The (S)-(-)-binol was used in the amount of each of 0.6, 1.0 and 1.5 mole equivalents based on omeprazole, as shown in Table 2. Then, the resulting solution was slowly cooled to 0°C and stirred for 12 hrs. The precipitated solids were filtered, and washed with a mixture of benzene and hexane to obtain the title compound.<br>
The optical purities and/or colors of the products thus obtained were<br>
shown in Table 2 and FIG. 1, together with those of the product obtained in<br>
Example 1.	<br>
