				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing (E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-cWoro-pyiirnidm-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate, an intermediate In the agrochemlcal industry.<br>
Methods for preparing (E)-methyl2-[2-(6-chloropyrimldin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate are described In WO 92/08703. In one method methanol is eliminated from the corresponding acetal, methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate. This is done by physical means, distilling the methanol at an elevated temperature preferably under reduced pressure and in the presence of an acid catalyst. The present invention provides a chemical means for removing the methanol using an acid anhydride, which provides an unexpected yield benefit.<br>
The present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), comprising treating a compound of formula (II) with an acid catalyst in presence of an acid anhydride at a temperature in the range of from 70°C to 110°C.<br>
Acid catalysts include acids (such as sulphonic acid or a derivative thereof (for example chlorosulphonic acid, methane sulphonic acid or p-toluene sulphonic acid), hydrochloric acid or an acetic acid derivative (for example trifluoroacetic acid or di- or trichloroacetic acid), a suitable phenol derivative (such as 2-cyanophenol) or potassium bisulphate.<br>
Acid anhydrides are preferably C2.5 alkyl anhydrides, for example acetic anhydride.<br>
Acid chlorides are preferably C2.s alkyl chlorides, for example acetyl chloride or propionyl chloride.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out in the present of a solvent. Such a solvent is preferably inert under the process conditions. Suitable solvents include saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons (such as toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane), an ether (such as glyme or diglyme) or a ketone (such as methylisobutylketone). It is preferred that the solvent has a boiling point in the range 70-140°C, especially in the range 85-120°C.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for preparing (E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrirmdm-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate having the formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
said    process    comprising    treating    methyl    2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate having the formula (II):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with an acid catalyst of the kind such as herein described in the presence of an acid anhydride at a temperature In the range of from 70°C to 110°C.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), comprising treating a compound of formula (II) with methane sulphonic acid or chlorosulphonic acid in the presence of an acid anhydride, the process being conducted in the presence of a solvent.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I), comprising treating a compound of formula (II) with methane sulphonic acid or chlorosulphonic acid in the presence of an acid anhydride, the process being conducted in the presence of a solvent.<br>
The process of the present invention can be carried out by treating a compound of formula (II) with an acid catalyst (preferably methane sulphonic acid) in the presence of an acid anhydride (especially acetic anhydride) at a temperature in range 70-110°C (especially 85-100°C) at ambient pressure.<br>
Alternatively, the process of the present invention can be carried out by treating a compound of formula (II) with an acid catalyst (preferably methane sulphonic acid) in solvent (especially toluene or methylcyclohexane) in presence of a suitable acid anhydride (especially acetic anhydride) at a temperature in the range 70-110°C (especially 85-100°C) at ambient pressure.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (I) comprising treating a compound of formula (II) (1 equivalent) with methane sulphonic acid (about 0.05 equivalents) in the presence of acetic anhydride (about 1 equivalent, preferably 1 to 1.1 equivalents) at a temperature in the range 85-105°C (especially 90-95°C), the process being carried out in the absence of a solvent.<br>
It is preferred that, when the process is carried out in the absence of a solvent, the compound of formula (I) is isolated by (i) distilling off by-products<br>
(preferably at a temperature in the range 50-150°C and under atmospheric pressure), (ii) partitioning the resulting residue between an organic solvent (such as toluene or a xylene) and water, and (ill) evaporating the organic phase to leave a compound of formula (I).<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention.         Throughout the Examples the following abbreviations are used: gc       =         gas chromatography NMR  =         nuclear magnetic resonance<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Methyl 2-[2-{6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate (44.8g) was heated to 95°C. 2-Cyanophenol (14.3g) was added and acetic anhydride (11.7g) was added via a syringe pump running at 6.35 ml h"1. The reaction was monitored by gc and 'H NMR, which showed that demethanolysis was complete in 4 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-,3-dimethoxypropanoate (44.6g) was heated to 90-95°C. 2-Acetoxybenzonitrile (19.3g) was added and then methane sulphonic acid (0.6Ig) was added via a syringe. The reaction was monitored by gc and 'H NMR, which showd that demethanolysis was complete in 5 hours.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A mixture of methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl}-3,3-dimethoxy-propanoate (17.98g), acetic anhydride (5.16g) and toluene (73ml) was stirred at 90°C for 20 minutes. Methane sulphonic acid (0.49g) was added to the mixture and the mixture was heated at 90°C for 1 hour. The mixture<br>
was cooled to room temperature, washed with cold water (25 ml) and with hot (50°C) water (2x25ml). The organic layer was evaporated at 75°C (initially on a rotary evaporator, then at circa 15mm Hg) to leave (E)-methyl2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxyl)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate as a solid (16. Ig).<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of Starting Material<br>
To a stirred mixture of 3-(a-methoxy)methylenebenzofuran-2(3H)-one(193.4g of 91% pure material) and 4,6-dichloropyrimidine (165.5g) in methyl formate (400g) at 20-25°C under nitrogen was added sodium methoxide (207g of a 30% w/w solution in methanol) portionwise, over 10 hours while maintaining the temperature at 20-25°C. Once all the sodium methoxide solution had been added the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 hours after which water (9g) was added. The methanol and methyl formate were distilled from the reaction mixture (internal temperature 90-95°C) to leave a residue.<br>
Water (700g) was added to the residue and the mixture stirred at 80°C for 30 minutes. Methylcyclohexane (400g) was added at 65°C, the temperature adjusted to 70°C and the mixture stirred for a further 30 minutes before being allowed to settle for 30 minutes. The aqueous layer was separated and the organic phase washed at 70°C with aqueous potassium hydroxide (400g of a 3% solution) and aqueous hydrochloric acid (80g of a 1% solution). Each wash was stirred for 30 minutes and allowed to settle for 30 minutes prior to separation. The methylcyclohexane solution was cooled to 25°C, stirred for 30 minutes and allowed to settle for 1 hour. A two phase system was obtained, a lower layer comprising:<br>
•	(E)-methyl        2-[2-(6-cWoropyiimidm-4-yloxy)phenyl}-3-methoxypropenoate<br>
7.28%<br>
•	methyl       2-[2-(6-chloropynmldin-4-yloj^)phenyl]-3,3-dimethojQT)ropanoate<br>
63.5%<br>
•	methylcyclohexane 15-20%<br>
and an upper layer comprising:<br>
•	(E)-methyl        2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate<br>
1.4%<br>
•	methyl       2-[2-(6-chloropyrimldln-4-yloxy)phenyl]-3,3-dlmethoxypropanoate<br>
11.4%<br>
•	methylcyclohexane 80-85%<br>
The upper layer was retained for use in future reactions.<br>
Solvent was removed from the lower layer by distillation at 50mm Hg at a gradually increasing temperature until 90°C was achieved. The mixture was held at 90°C for 30 minutes. After this time the pressure was reduced to 5-10mm Hg and the temperature increased to 120°C during which time chloromethoxypyrimidine distilled. [The condenser coolant was at 35-40°C.] The mixture is held at 120°C until analysis showed that the level of chloromethoxypyrimidine was acceptable.<br>
A sample comprising methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy) phenyl]-3,3-dimethoxypropanoate (230.7g) and (E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrimidin-4-yloxy) phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate (21g) prepared by a method analogous to the above was heated to 90-95°C. Acetic anhydride (74.2g) and methane sulphonic acid (17.5g) were added sequentially with stirring. The resulting<br>
mixture was heated at 90-95°C for 2 hours to leave (E)-methyl 2-[2-(6-chloropyrlmidin-4-yloxy)-phenyl]-3-methoxypropenoate (216.9g).<br><br>
