				<td>The present invention is concerned with pyrimidine derivatives having HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) repJication inhibiting properties. The invention further relates to methods for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them. The invention also relates to the use of said derivatives for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or the treatment of HIV infection.<br>
The present invention is aimed at providing particular novel series of pyrimidine derivatives having HIV replication properties. WO 99/50250 , WO 00/27825 and WO 01/85700 disclose certain substituted aminopyrimidines and WO 99/50256 and EP-834 507 disclose aminotriazines having HIV replication inhibiting properties.<br>
The compounds of the invention differ from the prior art compounds in structure, pharmacological activity and/or pharmacological potency. It has been found that the compounds of the invention not only act favorably in terms of their capability to inhibit the replication of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), but also by their improved ability to inhibit the replication of mutant strains, in particular strains which have become resistant to commercially available drugs (so-called drug or multi-drug resistant HIV strains).<br>

As used herein before, the term (=0) forms a carbonyl moiety when attached to a carbon atom, a sulfoxide moiety when attached to a sulfur atom and a sulfonyl moiety when two of said terms are attached to a sulfur atom.<br>
The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhalomethyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted methyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl; polyhaloC|.4alkyl or polyhaloCi-oalkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted C|.4alkyl or Cwalkyl, for example, the groups defined in halomethyl, 1,1-difluoro-ethyl and the like. In case more than one halogen atoms are attached to an alkyl group within the definition of polyhalomethyl, polyhaloCMalkyl or polyhaloCi^alkyl, they may be the same or different.<br>
The term heterocycle in the definition of R7 or R7a is meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles, for instance, pyrrolyl comprises l//-pyrrolyl and 2H-pyrrolyl.<br>
The carbocycle or heterocycle in the definition of R7 or R7a may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (I) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate, if not otherwise specified. Thus, for example, when the heterocycle is imidazolyl, it may be 1-imidazolyl, 2-imidazolyl, 4-imidazolyl and the like, or when the carbocycle is naphthalenyl, it may be l-naphthalenyl, 2-naphthalenyl and the like.<br><br>
When any variable (eg. R7, heteroatom, X2) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.<br>
Lines drawn from substituents into ring systems indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the couriterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms, which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxy-acetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-l,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methyIbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-n-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, W-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form.<br><br>
The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms (solvates) which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodi.de or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The Af-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several tertiary nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called TV-oxide.<br>
It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (1) and their A^-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I), and their Af-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) and their Af-oxides, salts, solvates or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1 % of the other isomers. Thus, when a compound of formula (I) is for instance specified as (E), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (Z) isomer.<br>
In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E (entgegen) or Z (zusarnmen) -stereochemistry at said double bond. The terms cis, trans, R, S, E and Z are well known to a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
Stereochernically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) obviously are-intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
For some of the compounds of formula (I), their prodrugs, JV-oxides, salts, solvates, quaternary amines or metal complexes and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. In these cases the stereoisomeric form, which was first isolated is designated as "A" and the second as "B", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration. However, said "A" and "B" stereoisomeric forms can be unambiguously characterized by for instance their optical rotation in case "A" and "B" have an enantiomeric relationship. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction. In case "A" and "B" are stereoisomeric mixtures, they can be further separated whereby the respective first fractions isolated are designated "Al" and "Bl" and the second as "A2" and "B2", without further reference to the actual stereochemical configuration.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)" is meant to also include their TV-oxide forms, their salts, their quaternary amines and their stereochemical ly isomeric forms. Of special interest are those compounds of formula (I) which are stereochemical ly pure.<br>
Whenever used hereinbefore or hereinafter that substituents can be selected each independently out of a list of numerous definitions, such as for example for R9 and R10, all possible combinations are intended which are chemically possible and which lead to chemically stable molecules.<br>

.Synthesis<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be prepared via a number of pathways a number of<br>
which are explained hereinafter in more detail.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can be generally prepared by reacting an indane (a-1) with pyrimidine derivative (a-2). The groups HX| and Wt are selected such that a X, linking moiety is formed.(Figure Removed)  <br>
In particular, W, is a suitable leaving group and Xi is a heteroatom. Examples of suitable leaving groups in (a-2) are halogen, in particular chloro and bromo, tosylate, mesylate, triflate and the like groups. For the preparation of compounds of formula (I) wherein X i is other than a heteroatom, -W] and -XiH can have other meanings as outlined hereinafter.<br>
The conversion of (a-1) with (a-2) to (a-3) in the above scheme is particularly useful when W, is a leaving group and Xi is a heteroatom such as -MR5-, -NH-NH-, -N=N-, -O-, -S-, ~Xi-CMalkanediyl-. This conversion is particularly suited in the instance where X, is -O-. In the instance where is S, the latter can conveniently be transferred to the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfon using art-known oxidation procedures.<br>
The above reaction usually is performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents are for example acetonitrile, alcohols, such as for example ethanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polar aprotic solvents such as /^AT-dimethyl-formamide; 7V,A/-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsufoxide, 1 -methyl-2-pyrroIidinone, [bminYjPFj; ethers such as 1,4-dioxane, propylene glycol monomethylether.<br>
Where Xi is -C(=O)- a starting material (a-1) wherein the group -X|H is a Orignard type of group (-Mg-halo) or lithium is reacted with a starting material (a-2) wherein W| is an ester (-COOalkyl). The latter ester may also be reduced to an alcohol with e.g. LiAIH4 and subsequently oxidized with a mild oxidant such as MnO2 to the corresponding aldehyde which subsequently is reacted with the (a-1) starting material wherein the group -XiH is a Qrignard type of group (-Mg-halo) or lithium. The compounds wherein -Xr is -C(=O)- can be converted to the -CHOH- analogs by a suitable reduction reaction e.g. with LiAlH4.<br>
Where X| is CMalkanediyl the linkage can be introduced by a Grignard reaction, e.g. by reacting a starting material (a-1) wherein the -X|H group is -Ci-talkanediyl-Mg-halo with an (a-2) reagent wherein W( is a halo group, or vice versa. Where X, is methylene, the methylene group can be oxidized to a is -C(=O)- group (X| is -C(=O)-) e.g. with selenium dioxide. The -C(=0)- group in turn can be reduced with a suitable hydride such as LiAltij to a -CHOH- group.<br>
Where X, is -NRI3-C(=O)-, or -C(=0)-NR13-, the X, linkage can be formed via a suitable amide bond forming reaction starting from an intermediate (a-1) wherein -XiH is -NHR13 and an intermediate (a-2) wherein Wl is a carboxyl group or an active derivative thereof, or vice versa starting from an intermediate (a-1) wherein -X|H is carboxyl group or an active derivative thereof and an intermediate (a-2) wherein W| is a<br><br>
group -NHR13. The amide bond may be formed following methodologies generally known in the art, e.g. by activation of the carboxyl group to a carbonyl chloride or bromide or by using a suitable, coupling agent.<br>
Where Xi is -X2-C|.4alkanediyl-, an intermediate (a-1) wherein the group -X|H is a radical -X2H is reacted with an intermediate (a-2) wherein the group W, is -C(-4alkanediyl-W2, wherein Wj in turn is a suitable leaving group. Or where X[ is ~CMalkanediyl-X2- an intermediate (a-1) wherein the group -X|H is -CMalkanediyl-W2, wherein W2 in turn is a suitable leaving group, is reacted with an intermediate (a-2) wherein W( is -X2H.<br>
The linkages of X2 being other than a heteroatom (i.e. X2 is -C(=O)-, -CHOH-) can be prepared by analogous procedures as for introducing the linker Xj.<br>
In the instance where X, is - NR5- the reaction of (a-1) with reagent (a-2) is typically conducted under neutral conditions or, which is preferred, under acidic conditions, usually at elevated temperatures and under stirring. The acid conditions may be obtained by adding amounts of a suitable acid or by using acidic solvents, e.g. hydrochloric acid dissolved in an alkanol such as I- or 2-propanol org in acetonitrile.<br>
The above reaction can be performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents are for example acetonitrile, an alcohol, such as for example ethanol, 2-propanol, 2-propanol-HCl; /V,JV-dimethylformamide; 7V,Ar-dimethyl-acetamide,l-methy[-2-pyrrolidinone; 1,4-dioxane, propyleneglycol monomethylether. Preferably the solvent is 2-propanol, 6 N HC1 in 2-propanol or acetonitrile, especially acetonitrile. Optionally, sodium hydride may be present.<br>
In the instance where Xi is -O-, the reaction is typically conducted as follows. Intermediate (a-1) is first reacted under stirring at room temperature with hydrides in an organic solvent. Subsequently, a solvent, such as N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethyl-acetamide or dimethylformamide, is added to the mixture and followed by the addition of reagent (a-2). Typically, the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at elevated temperatures to yield compound (a-3).<br>
The compounds of formula (a-3) having a Rl7substituent which is an oxo (=O) group (represented by structure (a-3-1)) can be used as a starting material to obtain compounds of formula (I) having a R17 substituent which is a =N- K.18 substituent, wherein =N- R18 is =NH, =N-R15, =N-R7, =N-0-R15, =N-O-R7 as defined above. In this reaction pathway, intermediate (a-3-1) is reacted with reagent (a-7) (reagent (a-7 is of<br><br>
general formula NH3; NH2-RU, NH2-R7, NH2-O-R13, NH2-O-R7, in particular Aryl-Ci.6al!cyl-O-NH2) at elevated temperatures in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of a base to generate a compound of formula (a-8).<br>
Similarly, the compounds of formula (a-3-1) can be used as a starting material to obtain compounds of formula (I) having a R17 substituent which is a =X substituent, wherein =X is =CH2) =CH-C(=0)-NR13R14, =CH-R7, or =CH-R15 as defined above. Intermediate (a-3) is further reacted with reagent (a-4) in a Wittig reaction or a Wittig-Horner reaction. In the former instance, reagent (a-4) is a Wittig type reagent, such as a triphenylphosphoniumylide, in the latter instance, a Wittig-Horner type of reagent, in particular a phosphonate, such as e.g. a reagent of formula di(C|.6alkyloxy)-P(=O)-X4, wherein X4 is a substituent R17 that can be linked to the ring via a double bond (exo double bond). The Wittig-Horner type of conversion typically is conducted in the presence of a base, preferably a strong base, in an aprotic organic solvent at room temperature. The reaction should be allowed sufficient time to complete, typically it is allowed to proceed overnight to yield compound (a-5). This latter compound may further be reacted in an alcoholic solvent under reducing conditions to generate a compound of formula (a-6).<br>
Both conversion reactions are outlined in the following reaction scheme. <br>

The oxo group in the compounds (a-3-1) may also be at other positions in the ring having the Rl7substituent(s), the same type of derivatisation may be performed resulting in the topical isomers of (a-8), (a-5) and (a-6).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared as outlined in the reaction scheme here below.<br>
(Figure Removed) <br><br>
An indane of formula (a-1) is reacted with a pyrimidine (a-9) wherein the substituents have the meanings specified herein and W: is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, halo, triflate, tosylate, methylsulfonyl and the like, yielding an intermediate (a-10), This reaction can be done similarly as outlined above for the reaction of (a-1) with (a-2), in particular for the various possibilities of the linker -X|-. Where necessary, the Wi group that does not intervene in this reaction may be replaced by a leaving group precursor such as a OH functionality which a particular stage of the reaction procedure is converted to a leaving group, e.g. by converting the OH group into a halogen group, or by reacting it with a suitable reagent such as POC13, tosyl chloride, mesyl chloride and the like<br>
The end products (I) can be prepared from this starting material (a-10) by reaction with the arnino substituted aromatic compound (a-11) in an arylation type of reaction.<br>
Suitable solvents for the reaction of (a-1) with (a-9) and of (a-10) with (a-11) are ethers, e.g. 1,4-dioxane, THF, alcohols, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, the aprotic solvents such acetonitrile, DMF, DMA, 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and the like, [f necessary a base can be added. Suitable bases in this reaction are for example sodium acetate, potassium acetate, Af,A/-diethylethanamine, sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium hydroxide and the like.<br><br>
In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, distillation, trituration and chromatography.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may further be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding //-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its Af-oxide form. Said W-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert.buty! hydro-peroxide.

The dehydration can be performed according to methodologies well-known to the person skilled in the art, such as the ones disclosed in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations. A guide to functional group preparations" by Richard C. Larock, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 1999, p 1983-1985, which is incorporated herein as reference.

Compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 comprises C2.6alkenyl can be converted into a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 comprises C|.6alkyl by reduction in the presence of a suitable reducing agent, such as for example H2, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as for example palladium on charcoal, and in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as for example an alcohol, e.g. methanol.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 represents CH(OH)-R16,can be converted into a compound of formula (I) wherein R3 represents C(=O)-R16by reaction with Jones's reagent in the presence 'of a suitable solvent, such as for example 2-propanone.<br>

Compounds of formula (I) having a carbon-carbon double bond can be reduced to the corresponding compounds with a single bond using catalytic hydrogenation procedures. In these proceures use is made of a noble metal catalyst. An attractive such catalyst is Pd. The palladium (Pd) catalyst may be a homogeneous Pd catalyst, such as for example Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, bis(dibenzylidene acetone) palladium, palladium thiomethylphenylglutararnide metallacycle and the like, or a heterogeneous Pd catalyst, such as for example palladium on charcoal, palladium on metal oxides, palladium on zeolites.<br>
Preferably, the palladium catalyst is a heterogeneous Pd catalyst, more preferably palladium on charcoal (Pd/C). Pd/C is a recoverable catalyst, is stable and relatively inexpensive. It can be easily separated (filtration) from the reaction mixture thereby reducing the risk of Pd traces in the final product. The use of Pd/C also avoids the need for ligands, such as for example phosphine ligands, which are expensive, toxic and contaminants of the synthesized products.<br>
Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br><br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>
Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures or some of the compounds of formula (I) or the described intermediates may be prepared according to the procedures described in WO 99/50250 and WO 00/27825.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomeric forms, in particular in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereorneric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure<br><br>
stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting<br>
groups.<br>
Functional groups, which are desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, terf-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydro-pyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include terf-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C^alkyl or benzyl esters.<br>
The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step.<br>
The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J W FMcOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2'"1 edition, T W Greene &amp; P G M Wutz, Wiley Intel-science (1991).<br>
The compounds of formula (I) show antiretroviral properties (reverse transcriptase inhibiting properties), in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an ever decreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the HIV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HIV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HIV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC).<br><br>
The present compounds also show activity against (multi) drug resistant HIV strains, in particular (multi) drug resistant HTV-1 strains, more in particular the present compounds show activity against HIV strains, especially HIV-1 strains, that have acquired resistance to one or more art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are those non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors other than the present compounds and in particular commercial non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The present compounds also have little or no binding affinity to human oc-1 acid glycoprotein; human a-1 acid glycoprotein does not or only weakly affect the and HIV activity of the present compounds.<br>
Due to their antiretroviral properties, particularly their anti-HIV properties, especially their anti-HIV-1 -activity, the compounds of formula (I), their W-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are useful in the treatment of individuals infected by HIV and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated with HFV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AlDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic Central Nervous System diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HIV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis.<br>
Thus in a further aspect, the compounds of the present invention including any subgroup defined herein may therefore be used as a medicine in particular against above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HIV infections.<br>
In view of the pharmacological properties of the compounds of formula (I), mere is provided a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from, or a method of preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from, viral infections, especially HIV infections. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), a JV-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans.<br><br>
In another aspect, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In still a further aspect there is provided a method of preparation a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein comprising mixing a compound of formula (I) with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.<br>
To aid solubility of the compounds of formula (I), suitable ingredients, e.g. cyclodextrins, may be included in the compositions. Appropriate cyclodextrins are a-, P-, y-cyclodextrins or ethers and mixed ethers thereof wherein one or more of the hydroxy groups of the anhydroglucose units of the cyclodextrin are substituted with Ci.galkyl, particularly methyl, ethyl or isopropyl, e.g. randomly methylated p-CD;<br>
hydroxyC] .galkyl, particularly hydroxyethyl, hydroxy-propyl or hydroxybutyl; carboxyCj.galkyl, particularly carboxymethyl or carboxy-ethyl; Cl-6alkylcarbonyl,<br>

The term mixed ether denotes cyclodextrin derivatives wherein at least two cyclodextrin hydroxy groups are etherified with different groups such as, for example, hydroxy-propyl and hydroxyethyl.<br>
The average molar substitution (MS.) is used as a measure of the average number of moles of alkoxy units per mole of anhydroglucose. The average substitution degree (D.S.) refers to the average number of substituted hydroxyls per anhydroglucose unit. The M.S. and D.S. value can be determined by various analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). Depending on the technique used, slightly different values may be obtained for one given cyclodextrin derivative. Preferably, as measured by mass spectrometry, the M.S. ranges from 0.125 to 10 and the D.S. ranges from 0.125 to 3.<br>
Other suitable compositions for oral or rectal administration comprise particles consisting of a solid dispersion comprising a compound of formula (I) and one or more appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" used hereinafter defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, in casu the<br><br>
compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components (in case additional pharmaceutical ly acceptable formulating agents, generally known in the art, are included, such as plasticizers, preservatives and the like). When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermo-dynamics, such a solid dispersion will be called "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered. This advantage can probably be explained by the ease with which said solid solutions can form liquid solutions when contacted with a liquid medium such as the gastro-intestinal juices. The ease of dissolution may be attributed at least in part to the fact that the energy required for dissolution of the components from a solid solution is less than that required for the dissolution of components from a crystalline or microcrystalline solid phase.<br>
The term "a solid dispersion" also comprises dispersions, which are less homogenous throughout than solid solutions. Such dispersions are not chemically and physically uniform throughout or comprise more than one phase. For example, the term "a solid dispersion" also relates to a system having domains or small regions wherein amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline compound of formula (I), or amorphous, microcrystalline or crystalline water-soluble polymer, or both, are dispersed more or less evenly in another phase comprising water-soluble polymer, or compound of formula (I), or a solid solution comprising compound of formula (I) and water-soluble polymer. Said domains are regions within the solid dispersion distinctively marked by some physical feature, small in size, and evenly and randomly distributed throughout the solid dispersion.<br>
Various techniques exist for preparing solid dispersions including melt-extrusion, spray-drying and solution-evaporation.<br>
The solution-evaporation process comprises the following steps :<br>
a)	dissolving the compound of formula (I) and the water-soluble polymer in an<br>
appropriate solvent, optionally at elevated temperatures;<br>
b)	heating the solution resulting under point a), optionally under vacuum, until the<br>
solvent is evaporated. The solution may also be poured onto a large surface so as to<br>
form a thin film, and evaporating the solvent therefrom.<br>
In the spray-drying technique, the two components are also dissolved in an appropriate solvent and the resulting solution is then sprayed through the nozzle of a spray dryer<br><br>
followed by evaporating the solvent from the resulting droplets at elevated temperatures.<br>
The preferred technique for preparing solid dispersions is the melt-extrusion process comprising the following steps :<br>
a)	mixing a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate water-soluble polymer,<br>
b)	optionally blending additives with the thus obtained mixture,<br>
c)	heating and compounding the thus obtained blend until one obtains a homogenous<br>
melt,<br>
d)	forcing the thus obtained melt through one or more nozzles; and<br>
e)	cooling the melt untill it solidifies.<br>
The terms "melt" and "melting" should be interpreted broadly. These terms not only mean the alteration from a solid state to a liquid state, but can also refer to a transition to a glassy state or a rubbery state, and in which it is possible for one component of the mixture to get embedded more or less homogeneously into the other. In particular cases, one component will melt and the other components) will dissolve in the melt thus forming a solution, which upon cooling may form a solid solution having advantageous dissolution properties.<br>
After preparing the solid dispersions as described hereinabove, the obtained products can be optionally milled and sieved.<br>
The solid dispersion product may be milled or ground to particles having a particle size of less than 600 u,m, preferably less than 400 um and most preferably less than 125 jam.<br>
The particles prepared as described hereinabove can then be formulated by conventional techniques into pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets and capsules.<br>
It will be appreciated that a person of skill in the art will be able to optimize the parameters of the solid dispersion preparation techniques described above, such as the most appropriate solvent, the working temperature, the kind of apparatus being used, the rate of spray-drying, the throughput rate in the melt-extruder<br>
The water-soluble polymers in the particles are polymers that have an apparent viscosity, when dissolved at 20°C in an aqueous solution at 2 % (w/v), of 1 to 5000 mPa.s more preferably of 1 to 700 mPa.s, and most preferred of 1 to 100 mPa.s. For example, suitable water-soluble polymers include alkylcelluloses, hydroxyalkylcelluloses, hydroxyalkyl alkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcelluloses, alkali metal salts of carboxyalkyl-<br><br>
celluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters, starches, pectines, chitin derivates, di-, oligo- and polysaccharides such as trehalose, alginic acid or alkali metal and ammonium salts thereof, carrageenans, galactomannans, tragacanth, agar-agar, gummi arabicum, guar gummi and xanthan gummi, polyacrylic acids and tlie salts thereof, polyrnethacrylic acids and the salts thereof, methacrylate copolymere, poly-vinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, copolymere of polyvinylpyrrolidone with vinyl acetate, combinations of polyvinylalcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyalkylene oxides and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. Preferred water-soluble polymers are hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses.<br>
Also one or more cyclodextrins can be used as water soluble polymer in the preparation of the above-mentioned particles as is disclosed in WO 97/18839. Said cyclodextrins include the pharmaceutically acceptable unsubstituted and substituted cyclodextrins known in the art, more particularly a, P or y cyclodextrins or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br>
Substituted cyclodextrins which can be used to prepare the above described particles include polyethers described in U.S. Patent 3,459,731. Further substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by Ci-galky), hydroxyCi_6alkyl, carboxy-Ci-6alkyl or Ci-6alkyloxycarbonylCi-6alkyl<br>
or mixed ethers thereof. In particular such substituted cyclodextrins are ethers wherein the hydrogen of one or more cyclodextrin hydroxy groups is replaced by Ci_3alkyl, hydroxyC2-4alky] or carboxyC]-2aIkyl or more in particular by methyl, ethyl, hydroxyethyl. hydroxypropyl, hydroxybutyl, carboxy-methyl or carboxyethyl.<br>
Of particular utility are the p-cyclodextrin ethers, e.g. dimethyl-p-cyclodextrin as described in Drugs of the Future, Vol. 9, No. 8, p. 577-578 by M. Nogradi (1984) and polyethers, e.g. hydroxypropyl p-cyclodextrin and hydroxyethyl p-cyclodextrin, being examples. Such an alkyl ether may be a methyl ether with a degree of substitution of about 0.125 to 3, e.g. about 0.3 to 2. Such a hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin may for example be formed from the reaction between p-cyclodextrin an propylene oxide and may have a MS value of about 0.125 to 10, e.g. about 0.3 to 3.<br>
Another type of substituted cyclodextrins is sulfobutylcyclodextrines.<br>
The ratio of the compound of formula (I) over the water soluble polymer may vary widely. For example ratios of 1/100 to 100/1 may be applied. Interesting ratios of the compound of formula (I) over cyclodextrin range from about 1/10 to 10/1. More interesting ratios range from about 1/5 to 5/1.<br><br>
It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds of formula (I) in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Useful surface modifiers are believed to include those which physically adhere to the surface of the compound of formula (I) but do not chemically bond to said compound.<br>
Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds of formula (I) involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds of formula (I) are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration.<br>
Said beads comprise a central, rounded or spherical core, a coating film of a hydrophilic polymer and a compound of formula (I) and optionally a seal-coating layer.<br>
Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof.<br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetennined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.<br>
Those of skill in the treatment of HIV-infection could determine the effective daily amount from the test results presented here. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to<br><br>
administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent.<br>
The present compounds of formula (I) can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as anti-virals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines for the treatment of viral infections. They may also be used alone or in combination with other prophylactic agents forme prevention of viral infections. The present compounds may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infections over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention or together with other anti-viral agents in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vaccines. Thus, the present compounds may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against HIV infection.<br>
Also, the combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of the present invention can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of the present invention, and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the prevention or treatment of retroviral infections, in particular, in the treatment of infections with multi-drug resistant retroviruses. Thus, to combat, prevent or treat HIV infections, or the infection and disease associated with HIV infections, such as Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS Related Complex (ARC), the compounds of this invention may be co-administered in combination with for instance, binding inhibitors, such as, for example, dextran sulfate, suramine, polyanions, soluble CD4, PRO-542, BMS-806; fusion inhibitors, such as, for example, T20, T1249, RPR<br><br>
103611, YK-FH312,1C 9564, 5-helix, D-peptide ADS-J1; co-receptor binding inhibitors, such as, for example, AMD 3100, AMD-3465, AMD7049, AMD3451 (Bicyclams), TAK 779, T-22, ALX40-4C; SHC-C (SCH351125), SHC-D, PRO-140, RPR 103 611; RT inhibitors, such as, for example, foscarnet and prodrugs; nucleoside RTIs, such as, for example, AZT, 3TC, DDC, DDI, D4T, Abacavir, FTC, DAPD (Amdoxovir), dOTC (BCH-10652), fozivudine, DPC 817; nucleotide RTIs, such as, for example, PMEA, PMPA (tenofovir); NNRTIs, such as, for example, nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, 8 and 9-C1TIBO (tivirapine), loviride, TMC-125, dapivirine, MXC-442, UC 781, UC 782, Capravirine, QM96521, GW420867X, DPC 961, DPC963, DPC082, DPC083, TMC-125, calanolide A, SJ-3366, TSAO, 4"-deaminated TSAO, MV150, MV026048, PNU-142721; RNAse H inhibitors, such as, for example, SP1093V, PD126338; TAT inhibitors, such as, for example, RO-5-3335, K12, K37; integrase inhibitors, such as, for example, L 708906, L 731988, S-1360; protease inhibitors, such as, for example, amprenavir and prodrug GW908 (fosamprenavir), ritonavir, nelfmavir, saquinavir, indinavir, lopinavir, palinavir, BMS 186316, atazanavir, DPC 681, DPC 684, tipranavir, AG1776, mozenavir, DMP-323, GS3333, KNI-413, KN1-272, L754394, L756425, LG-71350, PD161374, PD173606, PD177298, PD178390, PD178392, PNU 140135, TMC-114, maslinic acid, U-l40690; glycosylation inhibitors, such as, for example, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycine; entry inhibitors CGP64222.<br>
By administering the compounds of the present invention with other anti-viral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds can be potentiated. Combination therapies as described above exeii a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component of the combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations may reduce the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral therapy while not interfering with the antiviral activity of the agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in combination with immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, interferon alpha, interleukin 2, methionine enkephalin, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and the like; antibiotics, e.g. pentamidine isethiorate<br><br>
and the like; cholinergic agents, e.g. tacrine, rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine and the like; NMDA channel blockers, e.g. memantine to prevent or combat infection and diseases or symptoms of diseases associated with HIV infections, such as ADDS and ARC, e.g. dementia. A compound of formula (I) can also be combined with another compound of formula (I).<br>
Although the present invention focuses on the use of the present compounds for<br>
preventing or treating HIV infections, the present compounds may also be used as<br>
inhibitory agents for other viruses, which depend on similar reverse transcriptases for<br>
obligatory events in their life cycle.<br>

A mixture of 100 g of active ingredient, in casu a compound of formula (I). 570 g lactose and 200 g starch can be mixed well and thereafter humidified with a solution of 5 g sodium dodecyl sulfate and 10 g polyvinylpyrrolidone in about 200 ml of water. The wet powder mixture can be sieved, dried and sieved again. Then there can be added 100 g microcrystalline cellulose and 15 g hydrogenated vegetable oil. The whole can be mixed well and compressed into tablets, giving 10.000 tablets, each comprising 10 mg of the active ingredient. Coating<br>
To a solution of 10 g methylcellulose in 75 ml of denaturated ethanol there can be added a solution of 5 g of ethylcellulose in 150 ml of dichloromethane. Then there can be added 75 ml of dichloromethane and 2.5 ml 1,2,3-propanetriol. 10 g of polyethylene glycol can be molten and dissolved in 75 ml of dichloromethane. The latter solution can be added to the former and then there can be added 2.5 g of magnesium octadecanoate, 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone and 30 ml of concentrated color suspension and the whole can be homogenated. The tablet cores can be coated with the thus obtained mixture in a coating apparatus.<br><br>
Antiviral analyses:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for anti-viral activity in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that these compounds exhibited potent anti-HIV activity against a wild type laboratory HIV strain (HIV-1 strain LAI). The cellular assay was performed according to the following procedure.<br>
Cellular Assay Experimental Method:<br>
HIV- or mock-infected MT4 cells were incubated for five days in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor. At the end of the incubation period, all HIV-infected cells have been killed by the replicating virus in the control cultures in the absence of any inhibitor. Cell viability is measured by measuring the concentration of MIT, a yellow, water soluble tetrazolium dye that is converted to a purple, water insoluble formazan in the mitochondria of living cells only. Upon solubilization of the resulting formazan crystals with isopropanol, the absorbance of the solution is monitored at 540nm. The values correlate directly to the number of living cells remaining in the culture at the completion of the five day incubation. The inhibitory activity of the compound was monitored on the virus-infected cells and was expressed as EC5o and EC?o. These values represent the amount of the compound required to protect 50% and 90%, respectively, of the cells from the cytopathogenic effect of the virus. The toxicity of the compound was measured on the mock-infected cells and was expressed as CC.50, which represents the concentration of compound required to inhibit the growth of the cells by 50%. The selectivity index (SI) (ratio CC5o/EC5o) is an indication of the selectivity of the anti-HIV activity of the inhibitor. Wherever results are reported as e.g. pECjo or pCCjo values, the result is expressed as the negative logarithm of the result expressed as EC50 or CCso respectively.<br>
Antiviral spectrum:<br>
Because of the increasing emergence of drug resistant HIV strains, the present compounds were tested for their potency against clinically isolated HIV strains harboring several mutations. These mutations are associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors and result in viruses that show various degrees of phenotypic cross-resistance to the currently commercially available drugs such as for instance AZT and delavirdine.<br>
The antiviral activity of the compound of the present invention has been evaluated in the presence of wild type HIV and HIV mutants bearing mutations at the reverse transcriptase gene. The activity of the compounds is evaluated using a cellular assay and the residual activity is expressed in pEC50 values. Column A contains the pECso against<br><br>
strain A (Strain A contains mutation 1001 in HIV reverse transcriptase), Column B contains the pEC3o against strain B (Strain B contains mutation 1001 and 103N in HIV reverse transcriptase), Column C contains the pEC5o against strain C (Strain C contains mutation 103N in HIV reverse transcriptase), Column D contains the pEC5O against strain D (Strain D contains mutation 181C in HIV reverse transcriptase), Column E contains the pEC50 against strain E (Strain E contains mutation 188L in HIV reverse transcriptase), Column F contains the pEC50 against strain F (Strain F contains mutation 227C in HIV reverse transcriptase), and Column G contains the pEC50 against strain G (Strain G contains mutation 106A and 227L in HIV reverse transcriptase),). Column IIIB displays the pEC50 value against wild type HIV-LAI strain. ND, not determined.<br><br>
