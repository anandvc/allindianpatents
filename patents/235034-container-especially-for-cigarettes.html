				<td>The invention relates to a packing, especially for cigarettes, with a basic body comprising<br>
a floor surface and a first wall and a cap comprising a cover surface and a second wall,<br>
with the basic body and the cap being joined with each other at a first side of the first wall<br>
and a first side of the second wall in a tillable manner, with a gap being formed in the<br>
closed state of the packing between the further sides of the first wall and the furthersides<br>
of the second wall, with a protective wrapping being arranged around the basic body and<br>
the cap at least in the closed state of the packing, with the protective wrapping having a<br>
perforation in the region of the gap and being joined with the basic body and/or the cap at<br>
least in sections, especially glued or the like.<br>
Known such packings comprise a basic body made of cardboard or the like with a<br>
cellophane film as a protective wrapping. The protective wrapping is torn open during the<br>
first opening of the packing by means of a tape and thereafter the protective wrapping,<br>
which is arranged adjacent to the cap, and the tape are removed from the packing.<br>
The disadvantageous aspect in these packings is that the part of the protective wrapping<br>
which is arranged adjacent to the cap and the tape are obtained as waste during the first<br>
opening of the packing and need to be disposed of.<br>
US-A-S, 192,262 discloses such a packing for a cigarette box where the protective<br>
wrapping comprises perforations forming a tear tape. The disadvantageous aspect in the<br>
device according to US-A-S, 192,262 is that during the first-time opening of the packing<br>
the tear tape is removed from the outer covering and is obtained as waste.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a packing, especially for cigarettes, of<br>
the kind mentioned above in which the basic body is protected by a protective wrapping<br>
and in which no waste is obtained during the first opening.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that the cap comprises in<br>
the region of the further sides of the second wall a tab which can be inserted into a<br>
diametrically opposed slot which is arranged in the basic body or formed by the first wall<br>
and a stiffening element, with the tab being inserted in the slot in the closed state.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
This leads to the advantage that the protective wrapping can be opened along the perforation<br>
without having to remove parts such as a tape or the like from the protective wrapping. By joining<br>
the protective wrapping with the basic body and/or the cap it is ensured that the protective<br>
wrapping, during the tilting of the cap, will follow the same both during opening as well as<br>
closing. The tab offers in addition to the perforation a protection against any inadvertent opening<br>
of the packing, so that any loads occurring during the handling of the packing which might cause<br>
an inadvertent opening of the packing can be absorbed by the tab. By forming the slot by the first<br>
wall and a stiffening element, the slot can be produced without weakening the basic body.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the protective wrapping is glued<br>
at least over the entire length of the perforation with the basic body and the cap by means of an<br>
adhesive and that the adhesive seals openings of the perforation in the closed state of the packing.<br>
By joining the protective wrapping with the basic body and the cap at least over the entire region<br>
of the perforation, it is possible to ensure that the protective wrapping will not detach from the<br>
cap and/or the basic body in this region. The sealing of the perforation by the adhesive ensures in<br>
a simple manner that no humidity can penetrate through the openings of the perforation.<br>
In this connection it can be provided according to another embodiment of the invention that the<br>
adhesive is wax-like. A favorable sealing of the perforation can be achieved with a wax-like<br>
adhesive in a simple manner and at low production costs for the packing in accordance with the<br>
invention, with the protective wrapping still being easy to open along the perforation.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the protective<br>
wrapping is made integrally from a film, especially a cellophane film or the like. This<br>
embodiment represents a simple and inexpensive production of the protective wrapping.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that in the known manner<br>
an insert is provided which is arranged so as to rest on the basic body and cap at least in the<br>
closed state of the packing and that said insert is connected to the cap at least in sections,<br>
especially glued or the like. In this way it is possible that the insert, which represents an<br>
additional protection for the items packed into the packing in accordance<br>
with the invention, can also be opened without obtaining waste therefrom during the first<br>
opening of the packing in accordance with the invention.<br>
It can be provided for in a further embodiment of the invention that the insert comprises a<br>
closure region which can be severed from the insert along a further perforation or the like<br>
and that the closure region is joined with the cap, at least in sections. This ensures that the<br>
closure region remains joined with the packing even after the severing of the remaining<br>
insert from the packing.<br>
It can be provided for in a further embodiment of the invention that the tab can be flipped<br>
into the cap. The cap can thus be reinforced for multiple opening and closing.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the tab<br>
comprises at least one nose which can be latched into a recess of the cap. The nose can<br>
thus fix the tab in the cap.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention it can be provided that the tab is<br>
arranged in an offset fashion relative to the second wall substantially by the wall thickness<br>
of the first wall in the region of the gap, especially by means of a double fold or the like.<br>
This ensures that no projections or the like are formed in the outside shape of the closed<br>
packing in accordance with the invention.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for opening a closed packing, as described above.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a method in which waste is avoided.<br>
This is achieved in accordance with the invention in such a way that in a first step a<br>
protective wrapping is severed along a perforation, whereupon a cap is flipped open and a<br>
tab is pulled out of a slot in the basic body in the region of the further sides of the second<br>
wall and optionally a closure region of an insert which is joined with the cap is severed<br>
along a further perforation, whereupon the tab is flipped into the cap, with the closure<br>
region being arrangeable at least partly between the cap and the tab. This leads to the<br>
advantage that a multi-layer packing can be opened in a simple manner without removing<br>
parts or the like.<br>
In a further development of the invention it can be provided that the tab is latched by<br>
means of noses in diametrically opposed recesses in the cap. By latching the tab in the cap<br>
by means of the noses, it is possible to fix them in a simple manner. A part of the closure<br>
region between the tab and the cap can optionally be enclosed.<br>

Fig. 1 shows the insert 4 of a conventional cigarette box. The insert 4 comprises a closure<br>
region 41 which is delimited from the further insert 4 by means of a further perforation 42.<br>
The insert 4 comprises two gluing points 404 and 407. The insert 34 is folded along the<br>
dotted lines.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the folding layout of a basic body 1 and a cap 2 of a conventional cigarette<br>
box. The basic body 1 comprises a floor surface 11 and a first wall 12, 13. The cap<br>
comprises the cover surface 21 and a second wall 22, 23, with the basic body 1 and the cap<br>
2 being joined with each other in a tiltable manner on a first side 12 of the first wall 12, 13<br>
and a first side 22 of the second wall 22,23. The basic body comprises gluing points 101<br>
through 107. The cap comprises gluing points 208 to 210, with the two gluing points 210<br>
being glued with each other in the completed cigarette box. The gluing points 104 and 107<br>
are glued together with the gluing points 404 and 407 of the insert 4.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the folding layout of a stiffening element 5 of a conventional cigarette box. It<br>
comprises gluing points 503, SOS and 506 which are glued together with the respective<br>
gluing points 103, 105 and 106 of the basic body. A conventional cigarette box is enclosed<br>
in the closed state by a protective wrapping 3 which protects from humidity the basic body<br>
1 and the cap 2 which can be made of cardboard. The closed state of the packing<br>
characterizes the state of the packing before the first-time opening. If the packing is closed<br>
after the first-time opening again, the packing is in the closed state.<br>
In the first-time opening of a conventional cigarette box, the protective wrapping 3 is<br>
divided in the region of the cap 2 by means of a tape and the partial element which is<br>
arranged adjacent to the cap 2 as well as the tape are removed. Thereafter the cap 2 is<br>
opened and the closure region 41 of the insert 4 is pulled out of the packing, with the same<br>
being severed along the further perforation 42. After the opening the packing, both the<br>
partial section of the protective wrapping 3, the tape as well as the closure region 41 of the<br>
insert 4 must be disposed as waste.<br>
Figs. 4 to 6 show folding layouts of the first embodiment of a packing in accordance with<br>
the invention, with fig. 4 showing the folding layout of insert 4, fig. 5 showing the folding<br>
layout of basic body 1 and cap 2 and fig. 6 showing the folding layout of the stiffening<br>
element S. The folding layouts are especially suitable for a packing for cigarettes.<br>
The basic body 1 comprises a floor surface 11 and a first wall 12, 13 comprising a first<br>
side 12 and further sides 13. Cap 2 comprises a cover surface 22 and a second wall 22, 23<br>
which comprises a first wall 22 and further walls 23. The basic body 1 and the cap 2 are<br>
connected in a tilting manner with each other on the first side 12 of the first wall 12, 13<br>
and one the first side 22 of the second wall 22,23. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
tilting joint is formed by a fold 14, so that the basic body 1 and the cap 2 are joined with<br>
each other in an integral manner. In other embodiments of the invention it is possible that<br>
the basic body 1 and the cap 2 are also produced in a separated manner and can be joined<br>
with each other by means of a tilting joint. In the folded state of the basic body 1 and the<br>
cap 2, a gap is formed in the closed state of the packing between the further sides 13 of the<br>
first wall 12, 13 and the further sides 23 of the second wall 22, 23.<br>
The basic body 1 comprises the gluing points 101, 102, 104,105, 106 and 107, the cap the<br>
gluing points 208, 209 and 211, the insert the gluing points 404,407 and 411 and the<br>
stiffening element the gluing points SOS and S06. The gluing points 101, 102 are required<br>
in the folding of the basic body 1 and the gluing points 208 and 209 in the folding of the<br>
cap 2. The other gluing points are glued with each other in such a way that the same end<br>
figures come together, e.g. 211 with 411. It is sufficient when an adhesive or the like is<br>
applied to one of the mutually combined gluing points.<br>
Figs. 7 and 8 show the insert 4 according to the first embodiment of the invention. It can<br>
be folded from the folding layout according to fig. 3 and comprises the closure region 41<br>
which can be severed from the remaining insert 4 by means of the further perforation 42.<br>
The closed packing is shown in the figures 9 and 10. It is enclosed by the protective<br>
wrapping 3 which comprises a perforation 31 and is joined to the basic body 1 and the cap<br>
2. The perforation 31 is arranged in the region of the gap which is formed by the further<br>
sides 13 of the first wall 12, 13 and the further sides 23 of the second wall 22, 23. The<br>
connection is formed in figs. 9 and 10 by an adhesive 32 which is arranged between the<br>
basic body 1 and the protective wrapping 3 and the cap 2 and the protective wrapping 3. In<br>
the shown embodiment, the adhesive 32 is applied over the entire length of the perforation<br>
31, so that the protective wrapping 3 is glued over the entire length of the perforation 31<br>
with the basic body 1 and the cap 2. It appears to be further preferable when the adhesive<br>
32 seals openings of the perforation 31 in the closed state of the packing, so that no<br>
humidity can reach into the packing through the perforation 31. In this connection it has<br>
been proven to be advantageous when the adhesive 32 is wax-like. It is provided for in<br>
other embodiments that the protective wrapping 3 is joined either only with the basic body<br>
1 or with the cap 2. It can also be provided that the protective wrapping 3 is joined only in<br>
sections with the basic body 1 and/or the cap 2. The protective wrapping 3 can be formed<br>
in a simple manner in an integral manner from a film, with a cellophane film being<br>
especially suitable. By using a cellophane film it is possible to provide the protective<br>
wrapping 3 with a transparent configuration, as a result of which any imprint or the like on<br>
the basic body 1 and/or the cap 2 can be seen in the closed state of the packing through the<br>
protective wrapping 3. In other embodiments it can also be provided that the protective<br>
wrapping is joined at further regions with the basic body 1 and/or the cap 2.<br>
In the closed state of the packing, the insert (which is shown in figs. 7 and 8) is arranged<br>
so as to rest close to the basic body 1 and cap 2, with the perforation 42 being arranged in<br>
the region of the gap between the further sides 13 of the first wall 12, 13 and the further<br>
sides 23 of the second wall 22, 23. The insert 4 is joined with the gluing points 404 and<br>
407 to the gluing point 104 and 107 of the basic body and with a gluing point 411 to the<br>
gluing point 211 of the cap. The connection can also occur with other known means. In<br>
other embodiments of the invention these gluing points 104,404, 107, 407, 211,411 can<br>
also be arranged differently. In the case of the presence of an insert 4, the connection of<br>
the closure region 41 with the cap 2 is especially advantageous.<br>
Figs. 11 to 14 show the first opening of the closed packing in accordance with the<br>
invention according to figs. 4 to 10. Fig. 11 shows that the cap 2 comprises a tab 24 in the<br>
region of the further sides 23 of the second wall 22, 23, which tab can be inserted into a<br>
diametrically opposed slit 15 of the basic body 1. Fig. 13 shows that the tab 24 can be<br>
flipped into the cap 2. The tab 24 can be provided with noses 25 which can each be latched<br>
into a recess 26 of the cap 2. The recesses 26 of the cap 2 are shown in figs. S, 9 and 10.<br>
Embodiments with a different number and configuration of the noses 25 and recesses 26<br>
are provided.<br>
The slot 15 can be introduced into the further sides 13 of the first wall 12, 13 or be formed<br>
by the first wall 12,13 and the stiffening element 5. The configuration between the first<br>
wall 12, 13 and the stiffening element 5 can be produced in a simple manner, with the<br>
packing not being weakened by the slot 15.<br>
Figs. 15 to 20 show the process of the first-time opening and renewed closure of the first<br>
embodiment of the packing in accordance with the invention in a sectional view. Glued<br>
regions are shown by a dotted line.<br>
Fig. 15 shows the first embodiment of the packing in accordance with the invention in the<br>
closed state, with the delimitation of the basic body 1 and the cap 2 being indicated by<br>
means of the broken line. In the region of the gap between the basic body 1 and the cap 2,<br>
the tab 24 is attached to the cap 2, with the tab 24 being arranged in an offset manner<br>
relative to the second wall 22,23 substantially by the wall thickness of the first wall 12, 13<br>
in the region of the gap. It can thus be ensured that the transition between the basic body 1<br>
and the cap 2 is configured in a plane manner and without any projections. A double fold<br>
seems to be suitable for the offset configuration, as is shown in fig. 15. It is also possible<br>
to use other known means. The slot 15 is formed by the basic body 1 and the stiffening<br>
element S, so that the tab 24 is arranged in the closed state at least in sections between the<br>
basic body 1 and the stiffening element S. The insert 4 is arranged in the interior of the<br>
basic body 1 and the cap 2. The protective wrapping 3 is arranged around the basic body 1<br>
and the cap 2.<br>
When opening the closed packing in accordance with the invention, the protective<br>
wrapping 3 is severed along the perforation 31 in a first step. This can be performed with a<br>
preferably blunt instrument, especially a fingernail or the like. The perforation 31 can also<br>
be severed by applying a tilting moment on cap 2. Thereafter the cap 2 is flipped open,<br>
with the tab 24 being pulled from the slot 15. If an insert is provided, the closure region 41<br>
is severed along the further perforation 42 from the remaining insert. When the cap 2 is<br>
flipped open, the tab 24 is swiveled into the cap 2, with the closure region 41 optionally<br>
being arrangeable at least partly between cap 2 and tab 24. Thereafter the packing can be<br>
brought to the closed state by tilting back the cap 2. In contrast to the sealed state (fig. 15),<br>
the perforation 31 of the protective wrapping 3 is severed in the closed state (fig. 20) of the<br>
packing in accordance with the invention and optionally the closure region 41 is separated<br>
from the remaining insert 4 along the further perforation 42. Preferably, the tab 24 is<br>
swiveled into the cap 2. It is latched by means of noses 25 in diametrically opposed<br>
recesses 26.<br>
As a result of tab 24, which offers frictional resistance against the opening of the packing<br>
in accordance with the invention, it is possible to ensure that for the opening of the<br>
packing in accordance with the invention a predeterminable force is required, so that the<br>
likelihood of inadvertent opening can be excluded to a substantial extent during storage or<br>
transport. In other embodiments of the packing in accordance with the invention it can also<br>
be provided that the tab 24 is guided through the slot 15 again in the closed state.<br>
Figs. 21 to 38 show a further embodiment of the packing in accordance with the invention.<br>
It is distinguished from the first embodiment shown in the figs. 4 to 20 essentially by a<br>
different configuration of the insert 4 whose folding layout is shown in fig. 21. Figs. 24 to<br>
26 show the folded insert 4. The advantageous aspect in this embodiment is that the insert<br>
4 remains integral even after the opening of the packing and the closure region 41 is not<br>
severed completely from the remaining insert 4, as is shown from fig. 26.<br>
Figs. 22 and 23 show the folding layouts of the basic body 1 and cap 2 and the stiffening<br>
element 5. Figs. 27 and 28 show the closed packing according to the further embodiment<br>
which in its appearance does not differ from the first embodiment. Figs. 29 to 32 show the<br>
first-time opening of the further embodiment of the packing in accordance with the<br>
invention. It can be seen that in contrast to the first embodiment no part of the insert 4<br>
remains on top of the packed merchandise. This can clearly be seen by a comparison of<br>
figs. 13 and 31.<br>
The basic body 1 comprises the gluing points 101, 102, 104,105 and 106, the cap<br>
comprises the gluing points 208, 209 and 211, the insert comprises the gluing points 404<br>
and 411 and the stiffening element comprises the gluing points 505 and 506. The gluing<br>
points 101, 102 are required in the folding of the basic body 1 and the gluing points 208<br>
and 209 in the folding of the cap 2. The other gluing points are glued together in such a<br>
manner that the same end figures come together, e.g. 211 with 411. It is sufficient when an<br>
adhesive or the like is applied to one of the two meeting gluing points.<br>
Figs. 33 to 38 show the process of the first-time opening and renewed closure of the<br>
further embodiment of the packing in accordance with the invention in a sectional view<br>
which corresponds to the first embodiment. Glued regions are characterized by a dotted<br>
line.<br>
