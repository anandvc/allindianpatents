				<td>APPARATUS FOR MIXING<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for mixing<br>
of a chemical medium in gas gaseous or liquid state with a<br>
pulp suspension.<br>
In treatment of pulp suspensions there is  a need for<br>
intermixture  of  different mediums  for treatment,  for<br>
example for heating or bleaching purposes. Therefore it is<br>
desirable to disperse the medium in the pulp suspension<br>
during simultaneous  conveyance  of  the pulp  suspension<br>
through a pipe. Patent EP 664150 -discloses an apparatus<br>
for this function. For heating of pulp suspensions, steam<br>
is added which condense and therewith give off its energy<br>
content to the pulp suspension. A bleaching agent is added<br>
in bleaching that shall react with the pulp suspension. In<br>
connection to  the  treatment  of  recovered  fibre  pulp<br>
printing ink is separated by flotation, which means that<br>
air  shall  previously  be  disintegrated  in  the  pulp<br>
suspension such that the hydrophobic ink, or the printing<br>
ink,  may attach to the rising  air bubbles.  In this<br>
connection it is desirable that the medium for treatment,<br>
e.g. air, is evenly and homogeneously distributed in the<br>
pulp suspension, preferably with tiny bubbles to achieve a<br>
large surface against the pulp suspension.<br>
In all cases it is hard, with proportionately low addition<br>
of energy, to achieve an even intermixture of the medium<br>
in the flow of material. When heating pulp suspensions by<br>
supply of steam to a pulp pipe, problems often arise with .<br>
large steam bubble's that are formed on the inside of the<br>
pipe, this as a consequence of a non- disintegrated gas<br>
with small condensation surface. When these large steam<br>
bubbles rapidly implodes, condensation bangs arises that<br>
causes vibration in the pipe and in following equipment.<br>
This phenomenon limits the amount of steam that can be<br>
added to the system and thus the desired increase in<br>
temperature. It is hard to achieve a totally even<br>
temperature profile in the pulp suspension when large<br>
steam bubbles exists. In order to remedy these problems, a<br>
large amount of energy can be supplied to carefully admix<br>
the steam in the pulp suspension. Another variant is to<br>
disintegrate the steam already at the supply in the pulp<br>
suspension. In intermixing of bleaching agent in a pulp<br>
suspension, relatively large amounts of energy are used in<br>
order to provide that the bleaching agent is evenly<br>
distributed and conveyed to all the fibres in the pulp<br>
suspension. The energy requirements are controlled by<br>
which leaching agent that shall be supplied (rate of<br>
diffusion and reaction velocity) and also by the phase of<br>
the bleaching medium (liquid or gas) . The geometry at<br>
supply of the bleaching agent in vapour phase is important<br>
in order to avoid unwanted separation immediately after<br>
the intermixture .<br>
The object with the present invention is to provide an<br>
apparatus for supplying and intermixing of a chemical<br>
medium in a pulp suspension in an effective way and that<br>
at least partly eliminates the above mentioned problem.<br>
This object is achieved with an apparatus for mixing of a<br>
chemical medium in gaseous or liquid state with a pulp<br>
suspension according to the present invention. The<br>
apparatus comprises- a housing having a wall that defines a<br>
mixing chamber and a first feeder for feeding the pulp<br>
suspension to the mixing chamber. Further, the apparatus<br>
comprises a rotor shaft, that extends in the mixing<br>
chamber, a drive device for rotation of the rotor shaft<br>
and a rotor body that is connected to the rotor shaft. The<br>
rotor body is arranged to supply kinetic energy to the<br>
pulp suspension flow, during rotation of the rotor shaft<br>
by the rotation of the drive device, such that turbulence<br>
is produced in a turbulent flow zone in the mixing<br>
chamber. The apparatus also comprises a second feeder for<br>
feeding of the chemical medium to the mixing chamber and<br>
an outlet for discharging the mixture of chemical medium<br>
and pulp suspension from the mixing chamber. The apparatus<br>
is characterised by that the second feeder comprises at<br>
least one stationary feeding pipe, that extends from the<br>
wall of the housing into the mixing chamber and that has<br>
an outlet for the chemical medium in or in close vicinity<br>
to said turbulent flow zone.<br>
In that respect, in accordance with present invention, an<br>
even and effective intermixing of the chemical medium in<br>
the pulp suspension is provided.<br>
Further features and advantages according to embodiments<br>
of the apparatus according to the present invention are<br>
evident from the claims and in the following from the<br>
description.<br>

In fig. l is shown an apparatus according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention. The apparatus comprises a<br>
housing with a wall 2 that defines a mixing chamber 4 and<br>
a first feeder 6 for supplying of pulp suspension to the<br>
mixing chamber. Further, the apparatus comprises a rotor<br>
shaft 8, which extends in the mixing chamber 4, a drive<br>
device (not shown) for rotation of the rotor shaft and a<br>
rotor body 10 that is connected to the rotor shaft 8. The<br>
rotor body is arranged to supply kinetic energy to the<br>
pulp suspension flow, during rotation of the rotor shaft<br>
by the rotation of the drive device, such that turbulence<br>
is produced in a turbulent flow zone 12 in the mixing<br>
chamber. The apparatus also comprises a second feeder 13<br>
for feeding of the chemical medium to the mixing chamber<br>
and an outlet (not shown) for discharging the mixture of<br>
chemical medium and pulp suspension from the mixing<br>
chamber 4. The second feeder 13 comprises at least one<br>
stationary feeding pipe 14, that extends from the wall 2<br>
of the housing into the mixing chamber 4 and that has an<br>
outlet 16 for the chemical medium in or in close vicinity<br>
to said turbulent flow zone 12. The second feeder 13 may<br>
comprise a number of stationary feeding pipes 14, as<br>
evident from fig. 1, that extends substantially parallel<br>
to the ¦ rotor shaft 8 in the mixing chamber. Further,<br>
according to a not shown embodiment, the feeding pipes 14,<br>
respectively, may extend substantially radially to the<br>
rotor shaft 8 in the mixing chamber.<br>
In case the feeding pipe 14 extend parallel to the<br>
rotation shaft, the rotation shaft 8 may extend through<br>
the feeding pipe 14, whereby an annular outlet for<br>
chemical medium is defined by the rotor shaft 8 and the<br>
feeding pipe 14. In that respect, a feeding pipe 102 can<br>
extend coaxially as shown in fig. 2A, or eccentrically to<br>
a rotor shaft 104 as shown in fig. 2B, whereby an annular<br>
outlet 100 for the chemical medium is defined by the rotor<br>
shaft 104 and the feeding pipe 102.<br>
The outlet 16, 100 of the feeding pipe is suitably of<br>
rotational symmetrical design, such as a circular form as<br>
shown in fig. 3A. The outlet of the feeding pipe may also<br>
be of other non-rotational symmetrical design, e.g.<br>
elliptical according to fig. 3B-C, triangular form<br>
according to fig. 3D, or rectangular form as shown in fig.<br>
3E.<br>
In case the second feeder comprises a number of stationary<br>
feeding pipes 14, the outlets 16 of the feeding pipes 14<br>
can be situated symmetrically, on equal distance R from<br>
the rotor shaft 8, as shown in fig. 4A, or asymmetrically<br>
around the rotor shaft 8, with different distance Rl and<br>
R2, respectively, from the rotor shaft 8, as shown in fig.<br>
4B. In case the outlets 16 of the feeding pipes,<br>
respectively, are non-rotational symmetrical designed, at<br>
least one of the outlets 16 be provided with an<br>
orientation of rotation V1 in relation to the centre of<br>
rotor shaft that differs  from the corresponding orientations of rotation V2 of the other outlets, as<br>
evident from fig. 4C.<br>
Fig. 5A-C illustrates that a rotor body 200 according to<br>
the present invention may comprise a number of rotor pins<br>
202, which extends from the rotor shaft 204 in its radial<br>
direction. Each rotor pin may be curved forward from the<br>
rotor shaft (fig. 5A) or backward (fig. 5B) relatively to<br>
the rotational direction of the rotor body (see arrow in<br>
fig. 5A-C) , which both embodiments aims to provide a<br>
radial conveyance of the mixture. According to an<br>
alternative embodiment shown in fig. 5C, each rotor pin<br>
may have a width b, as seen in the rotational direction of<br>
the rotor body, that increase along at least a part of the<br>
rotor  body  in  direction  against  the  rotor  shaft  .2 04.  The<br>
embodiment  according  to  fig.  5C  decreases  the  opened  area<br>
and  by  that  the  axial  flow  velocity  increases.  The  rotor<br>
pins  202  can  be  provided  with  varying  cross-sections  as<br>
illustrated  in  fig.  6A-D.  Each  rotor  pin  may  be  designed<br>
with  a  circular  cross-section  as  shown  in  fig.  6A,  which<br>
is  simple   from  a  manufacturing  viewpoint   and   a   cost<br>
efficient  design.  The  rotor pins  202  may  also  be  provided<br>
with a triangular  or  quadratic  cross-section,  according to<br>
fig.   6B-C,  which  geometry  creates  a  dead  air  space  at<br>
rotation   of   the   rotor   shaft.   According   to   yet   an<br>
embodiment  the  rotor  pins  may  be  provided  with  a  shovel-<br>
shaped  cross-section  according  to  fig.  6D,  which  results<br>
in  a  sling-effect  at  rotation  of  the  rotor   shaft.   In<br>
addition,  as  evident  from  fig.  6C,  each  rotor  pin  may be<br>
designed  with  a  helix  shape,   suitably  with   quadratic<br>
cross-section,  in  the  axial  direction  of  the  rotor  pin.<br>
which  one  of  the  various  designs  of  the  cross-sections  of<br>
the rotor pins  202  that  are most preferable  depends  on the<br>
current flow resistance.<br>
Fig.  7A-C  shows  alternative  embodiments  of  a  rotor  shaft<br>
300  provided  with  one  or  more  axially  flow  generating<br>
elements  302.  As  is  shown  in  fig.   7A,  the  axial  flow-<br>
generating  element  can  comprise  a  number  of  blades  3 04,<br>
which  are   obliquely   attached  relatively   to   the   rotor<br>
shaft.  Rotation  of  the  rotor  shaft  causes  an  axial  flow.<br>
If  the  elements  are  of  various  rotational  orientations<br>
along  the  rotor  shaft  as  shown  in  fig.   7A,   different<br>
directions  of  flow  are  obtained  as  well.  In  addition,  the<br>
axial  flow-generating  element  can  comprise  a  screw  thread<br>
or a band thread  306,  according to  alternative  embodiments<br>
shown  in  fig.  7B-C,  which  extends  along  the  rotor  shaft<br>
300,  that  aims  to  force, the  fluid  closest  to  the  hub  of<br>
the rotor shaft towards some direction. For the feeding,<br>
the height of the band can suitably be about 5-35 mm.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment the axial flow-<br>
generating element can comprise a relatively thin<br>
elevation of about 3-6  mm on the surface of the shaft,<br>
suitably about 3,8 to 5,9 mm. This scale of lengths is<br>
suitably when it corresponds to the characteristic size of<br>
the fibre-flocks for kraft pulp at current process<br>
conditions. Thus, this should be variable in the process.<br>
The size of the flocks can be said to be in inverse<br>
proportion to the total work that is added to the fibre<br>
suspension. Screw thread or band thread may be used also<br>
when the rotor shaft extends through the feeding pipe as<br>
shown in embodiments in fig. 2A-B, if the height of the<br>
band is relatively short.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus comprises a flow-restraining<br>
disk 400 with on or more flow passages, having constant<br>
axial area, arranged to temporarily incre,a.s.e the flow<br>
velocity of the pulp suspension v/hen the pulp suspension<br>
passes the flow-restraining disk. The purpose of the disk<br>
is to create a controlled fall of pressure. The energy is<br>
used for static mixing and the disk is designed for<br>
varying pressure recovery depending on desired energy<br>
level. Fig. 8A-D shows different alternative embodiments<br>
of flow passages 402 in the axial direction of a flow-<br>
restraining disk 400. The flow area A of each flow passage<br>
increases or decreases in the direction of the flow, which<br>
in particular is shown in' fig. 8A-B. Fig. 8A shows a<br>
divergent opening, i.e. that an open area enlarges in<br>
axial direction. Fig. 8B shows a converging opening, i.e.<br>
where the open area diminish in axial direction. As shown<br>
in fig. 8C-D, each flow passage can extend obliquely from<br>
the up-stream side of the disk against the centres axis C<br>
of the disk.<br>
The flow-restraining disk 4 00 is preferably provided with<br>
a plurality of flow passages 4 02 as shown in fig. 9A-C,<br>
which passages can be arranged according to a number of<br>
alternative placement patterns, radially spread out on the<br>
flow-restraining disk. The disk is preferably circular or<br>
coaxial with the rotor shaft. The flow passages of the<br>
flow-restraining disk may for example form a Cartesian<br>
pattern (fig. 9A) which provides asymmetrical jet streams,<br>
or a polar pattern (fig. 9B) . Fig. 9C shows an alternative<br>
embodiment where the flow passages 4 02 of the flow-<br>
restraining disk 4 00 in axial direction are formed of<br>
concentrically rings 4 04 that are coaxial with a rotor<br>
shaft 406, and its rotor body 407, which may comprise one<br>
or more rotor pins 408, arranged on distance from and<br>
ahead of disk 400. The flow-restraining disk is suitably<br>
stationary arranged in the housing and the disk may<br>
comprise a number of concentrically rings 404, which are<br>
coaxial with the rotor shaft 406, and at least one radial<br>
bar 410, that fixates the rings 4 04 relatively each other<br>
and that are attached in the wall of the housing, whereby .<br>
the flow passages 4 02 are defined by the rings and the<br>
bar.<br>
However, a flow-restraining disk 500 can be integrated<br>
with the rotor shaft 502. Fig. 10A-D illustrates<br>
alternative embodiments of flow-restraining disks 500<br>
integrated with the rotor shaft 502. The rotor body 504<br>
may suitably comprise a number of rotor pins 50 6, which<br>
extends from the rotor shaft 502, whereby the disk is<br>
fixed to the rotor pins 50 6 on the down-stream side of the<br>
rotor body as shown in fig. 10A, or on its up-stream side<br>
as shown in fig. 10B. As shown in fig. 10C, the rotor body<br>
may comprise an additional number of pins 506', that<br>
extends from the rotor shaft on the down-stream side of<br>
the disk, whereby the disk 500 also is fixed to said<br>
additional pins 506'. Preferably, the disk comprise a<br>
number of concentrically rings 508, which are coaxial with<br>
the rotor shaft, and the rotor pins 506, 506'fixates the<br>
rings 508 in relation to each other, whereby flow passages<br>
510 are defined by the pins and the rings. Fig. 10D shows<br>
rotor pins 506 and concentrically rings 500. Further,<br>
spacer elements 511 are arranged between the rotor pins<br>
506 and the concentrically rings 500. The spacer elements<br>
are used in order to move the turbulent zone.<br>
