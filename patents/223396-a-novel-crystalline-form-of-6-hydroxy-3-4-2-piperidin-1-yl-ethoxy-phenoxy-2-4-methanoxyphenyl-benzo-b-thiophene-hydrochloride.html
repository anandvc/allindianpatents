				<td>A NOVEL CRYSTALLINE FORM OF 6-HYDROXY-<br>
3-(4-[2-(PIPERIDIN-l-YL)ETHOXY]<br>
PHENOXY)-2-(4-METHOXYPHENYL)BENZO[b]THIOPHENE HYDROCHLORIDE<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
6-Hydroxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl) benzo [b] thiophene hydrochloride (arzoxifene) <br>
was first described generically in U.S. Patent No. 5,510,357<br>
and was specifically disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,723,474<br>
(474) and European Patent Application 0729956. Arzoxifene<br>
is a nonsteroidal mixed estrogen antagonist/agonist, useful<br>
for, inter alia, lowering serum cholesterol and for<br>
inhibiting hyperlipidemia, osteoporosis, estrogen dependent<br>
cancers including breast and uterine cancer, endometriosis,<br>
CNS disorders including Alzheimer's disease, aortal smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation, and restenosis.<br>
Specifically, arzoxifene is useful for, and is being<br>
clinically evaluated for the treatment of receptor positive<br>
metastatic breast cancer; the adjuvent treatment of receptor<br>
positive patients following appropriate systemic or local<br>
therapy; the reduction of recurrence of invasive and<br>
noninvasive breast cancer; and the reduction of the<br>
incidence of invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in<br>
situ (DCIS). Arzoxifene is also useful in combination with<br>
radiotherapy, aromatase inhibitors, LHRH analogues, and<br>
acetyl choline esterase (AChE) inhibitors.<br>
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric<br>
(TGA), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and Karl<br>
Fischer (KF) analyses of bulk arzoxifene isolated by the<br>
procedures taught in '474 later indicated that said material<br>
was hydrated, poorly crystalline, and contained variable<br>
amounts of an organic volatile (ethyl acetate) in its<br>
lattice.<br>
Poorly crystalline materials are typically less<br>
desirable than highly crystalline materials for formulation<br>
processing. In addition, it is generally not desirable to<br>
formulate Pharmaceuticals containing substantial amounts of<br>
organic solvent (e.g., ethyl acetate) due to potential<br>
solvent toxicity to the recipient thereof and changes in<br>
potency of the pharmaceutical as a function of the solvent.<br>
Although the arzoxifene prepared by the procedures<br>
taught in 474 could be used as a pharmaceutical it would be<br>
highly desired and advantageous to find a more crystalline<br>
form of arzoxifene that did not contain an organic solvent<br>
within its crystal lattice which could be reproducibly and<br>
efficiently prepared on a commercial scale.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is related to a novel non-<br>
stoichiometric hydrated crystalline form of 6-hydroxy-3-(4-<br>
[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene hydrochloride (F-III) having<br>
an X-ray diffraction pattern which comprises the following<br>
peaks: 4.6 ±0.2, 7.8 ±0.2, 9.3 ±0.2, 14.0 ±0.2, 17.6 ±0.2,<br>
20.8 ±0.2, and 24.3 ±0.2° in 20; when obtained at 25 ± 2°C<br>
and 35 ± 10% relative humidity (RH) from a copper radiation<br>
source.<br>
Moreover the present invention relates to a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation comprising F-III; one or more<br>
pharmaceutical carriers, diluents, or excipients; and<br>
optionally estrogen, optionally progestin, optionally an<br>
aromatase inhibitor, optionally an LHRH analogue and<br>
optionally an acetyl choline esterase (AChE) inhibitor.<br>
In addition, the present invention is related to<br>
methods for using F-III to inhibit pathological conditions<br>
such as: uterine fibrosis, endometriosis, aortal smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferation, restenosis, breast cancer,<br>
uterine cancer, prostatic cancer, benign prostatic<br>
hyperplasia, bone loss, osteoporosis, cardiovascular<br>
disease, hyperlipidemia, CNS disorders, and Alzheimer's<br>
disease and for using F-III for the manufacture of a<br>
medicament for inhibiting same.<br>
The present invention is further related to methods for<br>
using F-III to up-regulate choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)<br>
and for using F-III for the manufacture of a medicament for <br>
up-regulating same.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Bulk arzoxifene prepared by the procedure taught in<br>
M74 (Example 41, crystallization from a mixture of ethanol<br>
and ethyl acetate, filtration and drying of the filter cake<br>
in vacuo to a constant weight at room temperature) was<br>
characterized by XRD and was found to be poorly crystalline.<br>
1h NMR confirmed that the bulk material contained 6% ethyl<br>
acetate.<br>
The crystallization procedure taught in 474 was<br>
subsequently modified so that ethanol was added to a<br>
suspension of crude arzoxifene in refluxing ethyl acetate.<br>
Upon cooling and vacuum filtration, the solid that results<br>
from this modified procedure is a highly crystalline mixed<br>
ethyl acetate/water solvate of arzoxifene (hereinafter<br>
referred to as S-II) which was later discovered to be a<br>
starting material for F-I (another non-stoichiometric<br>
hydrated crystalline form of arzoxifene).<br>
F-I may be prepared by removing the ethyl acetate from<br>
S-II's crystal lattice by vacuum drying/annealing S-II at<br>
elevated temperatures. The time and temperature required to<br>
anneal S-II in order to prepare F-I will vary from lot to<br>
lot but is typically on the order of 5 days at around 100°C.<br>
High temperatures are needed to effect the conversion of S-<br>
II to F-I via this procedure, since slurrying S-II in water<br>
at ambient temperature or storing a sample at 98% RH for 3<br>
weeks afforded no conversion to F-I. Furthermore, drying S-<br>
II in a convection oven at high temperatures did not de-<br>
solvate the material either, suggesting that a vacuum is<br>
also required to pull the ethyl acetate from S-II's lattice.<br>
Preferably, F-I is readily prepared and isolated at ambient<br>
temperature by crystallization of arzoxifene (or any<br>
polymorph/solvate thereof) from tetrahydrofuran. <br>
In accordance with the present invention, a<br>
particularly preferred form of arzoxifene is F-III. F-III<br>
is readily prepared and isolated at ambient temperature.<br>
Only moderate drying conditions are required to remove low<br>
levels of residual crystallization solvent in the<br>
preparation of F-III. These moderate drying conditions<br>
consistently result in a solid of high purity (i.e., free of<br>
residual organic solvent) and crystallinity and, thus, use<br>
of F-III eliminates toxicology issues associated with<br>
residual and crystal lattice organic solvent. Furthermore,<br>
preparation of F-III is simple and efficient, i.e., is<br>
amenable to bulk manufacture.<br>
F-III is readily prepared and isolated at ambient<br>
temperature by crystallization of arzoxifene (or any<br>
polymorph/solvate thereof) from a mixture of isopropyl<br>
alcohol (IPA) and water. Typically, arzoxifene may be<br>
suspended in a mixture of IPA and water and heated in order<br>
to effect dissolution of the arzoxifene starting material.<br>
Once dissolution is achieved, the solution is allowed to<br>
cool slowly to room temperature and then further (with the<br>
aid of an ice bath or refrigeration) to between 0 and 5°C.<br>
After a sufficient amount of time has elapsed for<br>
crystallization to occur, the crystals may be collected by<br>
vacuum filtration and dried to a constant weight in vacuo to<br>
obtain F-III in yields greater than 80%.<br>
Suitable arzoxifene starting material for the above<br>
crystallization includes, but is not limited to, S-II, F-I,<br>
arzoxifene prepared by the procedures taught in 474, or any<br>
mixture thereof. It is not important which form of<br>
arzoxifene one starts with because crystallization from IPA<br>
and water, according to the procedures described herein,<br>
results in F-III crystals. The ratio of water to IPA (v:v)<br>
is generally about 1:1 to 9:1. More preferably, the ratio<br>
is between 2.5 and 5.6:1. Most preferably, the ratio is<br>
between 3 to 5.6:1. Upon collection of the crystals by<br>
vacuum filtration, the F-III wet cake may be washed with<br>
cold deionized water before drying in vacuo. In addition,<br>
slightly elevated drying temperatures (about 50°C for 12 to<br>
24 hours) are preferred. For commercial scale synthesis of<br>
F-III, it may be advantageous to seed the crystallization<br>
with F-III.<br>
In a preferred process, F-III is prepared, isolated,<br>
and purified contiguous with the chemical removal of the 6-<br>
isopropyl hydroxy protecting group from 6-isopropoxy-3-(4-<br>
[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyDbenzo[b]thiophene hydrochloride (precursor A).<br>
The deprotection reaction is monitored for complete removal<br>
of the isopropyl protecting group and once it is determined<br>
that the removal is substantially complete, the work-up of<br>
the reaction will preferably include a crystallization under<br>
the conditions that provide F-III as discussed above and<br>
below. Methods for preparing precursor A and for removing<br>
the isopropyl group may be found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,723,474, the teachings of which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
In another preferred process, F-III is prepared,<br>
isolated and purified contiguous with the chemical reduction<br>
of the S-oxide and chemical removal of the benzyl protecting<br>
group from the 6-hydroxyl in 6-benzyloxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-<br>
1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene-<br>
(S-oxide) (precursor B). The reduction and deprotection<br>
reactions are monitored for complete reduction of the<br>
sulfoxide to the sulfide and complete removal of the benzyl<br>
hydroxy protecting group. Once it is determined that the<br>
reduction/removal is substantially complete, the work-up of<br>
the reaction will preferably include a crystallization under<br>
the conditions that provide F-III as discussed herein.<br>
Methods for preparing precursor B, for removing the benzyl<br>
group, and for reducing the 1-sulfoxide to the corresponding<br>
sulfide may also be found in the previously incorporated by<br>
reference U.S. Patent No. 5,723,474.<br>
Irrespective of the chemistry utilized in the<br>
deprotection and reduction steps, crystallization of<br>
arzoxifene from the IPA/water solutions disclosed herein<br>
consistently produces F-III crystals in high purity.<br>
Characterization and Differentiation of S-II, F-I and F-III<br>
DSC/TGA and XRD methods were used to characterize S-II,<br>
F-I and F-III. TGA is often very useful for distinguishing<br>
between different solid forms of a material because the<br>
temperature(s) at which a physical change in a material<br>
occurs is usually characteristic of the polymorph or<br>
solvate. DSC is a technique that is often used to screen<br>
compounds for polymorphism and solvate formation. Lastly,<br>
XRD is a technique that detects long-range order in a<br>
crystalline material.<br>
Arzoxifene prepared by the procedures taught in 474<br>
gave XRD patterns with poor signal-to-noise ratios and a<br>
raised baseline, indicative of poorly crystalline material.<br>
Therefore, comparisons of F-I and F-III are made to the<br>
material (S-II) produced by the modified arzoxifene<br>
crystallization procedure discussed above (addition of<br>
ethanol to a suspension of arzoxifene in refluxing ethyl<br>
acetate).<br>
Representative DSC/TGA traces of S-II, F-I and F-III<br>
are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The DSC<br>
trace for S-II shows a broad endotherm beginning at about<br>
62°C, corresponding to the loss of ethyl acetate and water<br>
from the lattice. The endotherm beginning at about 152°C<br>
represents a melt. The TGA weight loss of approximately<br>
2.5% occurs simultaneous with the first transition, while<br>
the remaining 0.5% weight loss occurs up to the onset of<br>
melting, suggesting that some solvent molecules are more<br>
tightly held in the lattice.<br>
The DSC trace of F-I shows a broad endotherm beginning<br>
at about 75°C, followed by a second endotherm beginning at<br>
about 155°C corresponding to a melt. The TGA trace of F-I<br>
shows a gradual weight loss of 0.3% followed by a sharp loss<br>
of 1.5%, which together represent dehydration of the<br>
lattice. The onset of the first DSC transition and the<br>
corresponding TGA weight loss are offset slightly due to the<br>
difference in heating rates. The initial weight loss<br>
represents weakly held waters of hydration while the second<br>
weight loss is consistent with approximately 0.5 mole of<br>
water present in the lattice at very low relative humidities<br>
(below 5% - see moisture sorption data).<br>
The DSC trace of F-III features a broad, low-<br>
temperature endotherm at about 3 0°C, followed by a second<br>
broad and relatively weak endotherm beginning at about 7 0°C,<br>
and a final transition beginning at about 146°C<br>
corresponding to a melt. The sharp 1.5% (~0.5 mole) weight<br>
loss in the TGA coincident with the first endotherm<br>
corresponds to loss of weakly held water molecules, while<br>
the additional ~1.6% weight loss above 60°C represents loss<br>
of more tightly held water molecules, i.e., those which are<br>
present at very low relative humidities. The weight loss<br>
observed after 170°C corresponds to decomposition of F-III.<br>
The XRD patterns of F-I and F-III feature sharp peaks<br>
and a flat baseline, indicative of highly crystalline<br>
materials. The angular peak positions in 20 and<br>
corresponding I/Io data for representative samples of F-I,<br>
F-III and S-II is tabulated in Table 1. Although many of<br>
the intense reflections are generally at similar diffraction<br>
angles, each of the forms gives a different powder pattern,<br>
allowing for a clear distinction between S-II, F-I and F-<br>
III.<br>
It is well known in the crystallography art that, for<br>
any given polymorph, the relative intensities of the<br>
diffraction peaks may vary due to preferred orientation<br>
resulting from factors such as crystal morphology. Where<br>
the effects of preferred orientation are present, peak<br>
intensities are altered, but the characteristic peak<br>
positions of the polymorph are unchanged. See, e.g., The<br>
United States Pharmacopeia #23, National Formulary #18,<br>
pages 1843-1844, 1995. Thus, based on peak intensities as<br>
well as peak position, F-III may be identified by the<br>
presence of peaks at 4.6 ±0.2, 7.8+0.2, 9.3 ±0.2,<br>
14.0 ±0.2, 17.6 ±0.2, 20.8 ±0.2, and 24.3 ±0.2° in 20; when<br>
the pattern is obtained at 25 ± 2°C and 35 ± 10% relative<br>
humidity from a copper radiation source.<br>
Further Characterization of F-I and F-III<br>
Hygroscopicicity studies were performed on F-I and F-<br>
III. The moisture sorption isotherms for F-I and F-III are<br>
shown in Figure 4. Upon initial exposure of the samples to<br>
approximately 5% RH, there was an immediate weight gain of<br>
1.5% and 1.7% moisture for F-I and F-III, respectively,<br>
equivalent to approximately 0.5 mole of water. Both forms<br>
show a continuous sorption of moisture through the entire<br>
humidity range, which is likely due to incorporation of<br>
water molecules in the lattices.<br>
The difference in the moisture uptake of the two forms<br>
likely reflects the amount of water that can be incorporated<br>
into the two lattices (i.e., the amount of available space<br>
in the lattice that can accommodate water molecules). Lack<br>
of hysteresis in the sorption-desorption isotherms of F-I<br>
and F-III indicates that the crystal forms rapidly<br>
equilibrate at any given humidity.<br>
The moisture sorption profiles for F-I and F-III reveal<br>
that these forms are essentially non-stoichiometric<br>
hydrates. At ambient relative humidity (about 50% RH), F-I<br>
contains approximately 1.7% water, corresponding to 0.5<br>
moles of water, while F-III has sorbed about 3.0% water<br>
which corresponds to about 0.85 moles of water. The bulk<br>
forms of F-I and F-III rapidly equilibrate with the<br>
atmosphere, so that the water content observed by analytical<br>
techniques is a reflection of the relative humidity at the<br>
time of data collection. Lot-to-lot differences observed in<br>
the DSC data likely results from the samples being hydrated<br>
to different extents due to different ambient storage<br>
conditions.<br>
XRD patterns were obtained for samples of F-I and F-III<br>
stored at different relative humidities (0, 22, 50, and<br>
80%). There is a gradual shifting of the initial (0% RH) F-<br>
III peaks at about 13.8, 17.6, 18.0, 20.5 and 24.0° in 20 as<br>
well as slight shifting of less intense peaks, as the<br>
relative humidity is increased. These observed changes in<br>
the XRD patterns of F-III indicate that the unit cell<br>
dimensions are changing, presumably to accommodate weakly<br>
held water molecules as the relative humidity is increased.<br>
The continuous shifting of peaks with humidity correlates<br>
well with moisture sorption data that showed a gradual<br>
weight gain over this RH range, providing evidence for<br>
variable hydrate formation.<br>
A similar experiment was carried out on F-I to<br>
determine whether varying the relative humidity would have a<br>
similar effect on its lattice (0, 25, 52, 73 and 95% RH).<br>
Very slight shifting of the 0% RH peaks at about 7.7, 18.3,<br>
18.5, 20.5, 20.8° in 20 is observed as the relative humidity<br>
is increased. The peaks at about 7.7, 20.8, and 24.1 also<br>
appear to become slightly broadened and less resolved at<br>
higher relative humidities, indicating that water is being<br>
sorbed into amorphous components (or plasticizes the solid),<br>
particularly at 73 and 95% RH. The shifting of peaks in the<br>
XRD patterns of F-I is less dramatic than the peak shifts<br>
observed as F-III was exposed to different relative<br>
humidities. This suggests that the F-I lattice does not<br>
undergo the same expansion and/or contraction as the F-III<br>
lattice.<br>
F-I and F-III were found to be stable over the entire<br>
relative humidity range, despite the ability of F-III to<br>
sorb nearly twice as much water. The two forms were found<br>
to have comparable crystal size, morphology, aqueous<br>
solubilities and dissolution rates.<br>
A drying study was carried out to monitor the<br>
desolvation of S-II as a function of drying time and<br>
temperature (see Figure 5).. XRD patterns were taken at<br>
various timepoints during the desolvation experiment. Many<br>
diffraction peaks from the desolvation study of S-II appear<br>
at similar angles to F-I, confirming that the lattices of S-<br>
II and F-I are very similar. The disappearance of<br>
diffraction peaks at about 6.8, 7.2 and 14.0° in 29 after<br>
only minimal drying suggests that these reflections may be<br>
attributed to crystallographic planes containing partial<br>
electron density of ethyl acetate molecules.<br>
Extended annealing of the solvated material under<br>
vacuum at high temperatures yielded F-I. F-I prepared this<br>
way showed a high degree of crystallinity by XRD.<br>
Therefore, material generated by crystallization from a<br>
solution of ethanol and ethyl acetate followed by vacuum<br>
drying for only a few hours as taught in 474 showed very<br>
poor crystallinity because such a procedure results in<br>
partially desolvated S-II.<br>
F-I and F-III have several advantages over the prior<br>
art form of arzoxifene described above. Relative to the<br>
arzoxifene produced by the procedures taught in 474, F-I<br>
and F-III are more stable at ambient temperature and are,<br>
therefore, more amenable to pharmaceutical development,<br>
i.e., development of a dosage formulation. In addition, F-I<br>
and F-III are much more crystalline than the form disclosed<br>
in 474. Crystalline materials are generally less<br>
hygroscopic and more stable (e.g., less prone to chemical<br>
degradation, maintains consistent potency) than amorphous<br>
materials and are, therefore, more desirable for formulation<br>
processing. Furthermore, unlike the form of arzoxifene<br>
produced by the procedures taught in 474, which contained<br>
ethyl acetate and water in its lattice, F-I and F-III<br>
contain only water.<br>
Characterization Methods<br>
DSC measurements were performed on a TA Instruments<br>
2920 Modulated DSC attached to a Thermal Analyst 3100 and<br>
equipped with a refrigerated cooling system. Samples (3-5<br>
mg) were heated in crimped aluminum pans from 10 to 240°C at<br>
a heating rate of 2°C/min.<br>
TGA analyses were performed on a TA Instruments 2 050<br>
Thermogravimetric Analyzer attached to a Thermal Analyst<br>
3100. Samples (5-10 mg) were heated in open pans from 25°C<br>
to 250°C at a heating rate of 5°C/min.<br>
XRD patterns were obtained on a Siemens D5000 X-ray<br>
powder diffractometer, equipped with a CuKCX source (l =<br>
1.54056 A) and a Kevex solid-state detector, operating at 50<br>
kV and 40 mA. Each sample was scanned between 4o and 35o in<br>
20. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30<br>
minutes at the desired temperature and/or relative humidity<br>
before data collection.<br>
Hygroscopicity measurements were made for F-I and F-III<br>
using the VTI method as follows. Each sample was dried<br>
under vacuum at 60°C until no further weight loss was<br>
detected, at which time the sample chamber was brought to 0%<br>
relative humidity. Moisture sorption isotherms were<br>
obtained at 25°C using a VTI vacuum moisture balance with<br>
the following conditions: sample size 10-15 mg,<br>
adsorption/desorption range 0-95% relative humidity, step<br>
interval 5%, sample interval 10 minutes.<br>
The following examples further illustrate processes for<br>
preparing the hydrate of the present invention. The<br>
examples are not intended to be limiting to the scope of<br>
these processes in any respect, and should not be so<br>
construed.<br>

F-III From 6-Isopropoxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-<br>
yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene<br>
Hydrochloride<br>
To a methylene chloride solution (100 mL) of 6-<br>
isopropoxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-<br>
methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene hydrochloride (10 g, 18<br>
mmol) under a nitrogen atmosphere at -10°C to -2 0°C, was<br>
added BCI3(g) (4.23 g, 34 mmol) at a rate which maintains<br>
the temperature of the reaction below -10°C. After the<br>
addition was complete, the reaction was allowed to stir for<br>
an additional 2 hours. To the reaction, isopropyl alcohol<br>
(IPA, 12.35 mL, 167 mmol) was slowly added at less than<br>
-10°C and stirring was continued for 3 0 minutes. A separate<br>
flask was charged with 100 mL water and cooled with an ice<br>
bath to approximately 0°C. The product solution was<br>
transferred to the water via cannula, maintaining vigorous<br>
stirring. The resultant white slurry was allowed to stir at<br>
0°C for 1 hour. The product was recovered by filtration and<br>
rinsed with 25 mL 40% CH2Cl2/water then with 25 mL cold<br>
water. The product was suspended into 60 mL IPA and 60 mL<br>
water and heated to 60°C. A solution was obtained at 48°C.<br>
Additional water (12 0 mL) was added. The solution was<br>
allowed to cool to 35°C and the slurry was further cooled<br>
slowly to 0-5°C and stirred for several hours. The product<br>
was isolated by filtration and washed with cold deionized<br>
water (25 mL). F-III wetcake was dried to a constant weight<br>
in vacuo at 50°C for 12 to 24 hours to provide F-III.<br>
Example 2<br>
F-III From 6-Benzyloxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-<br>
yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene-(S-<br>
oxide)<br>
To a 2 50 mL Parr bottle was added deionized water (5.25<br>
mL), 1M HC1 (7.74 mL, 7.75 mmol), 10% Pd/C (type A32110,<br>
1.37 g, 1.29 mmol Pd), [6-benzyloxy-3-(4-[2-(piperidin-1-<br>
yl)ethoxy]phenoxy)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)benzo[b]thiophene-(S-<br>
oxide) (3 g, 5.16 mmol), and isopropyl alcohol (32 mL) at<br>
ambient temperature. The bottle was fitted to a Parr<br>
shaker, sequentially evacuated and gassed with nitrogen<br>
twice, and subsequently evacuated and filled with hydrogen<br>
gas to a pressure of 30 psig. The shaker was started and<br>
the reaction mixture was heated to 60°C. The reaction was<br>
determined to be complete by HPLC analysis after<br>
approximately 4 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered<br>
through a pad of diatomaceous earth, and the pad was washed<br>
with 0.1 M HC1 (2 x 10 mL). The solvent was removed in<br>
vacuo at approximately 5 0°C. The resultant residue was<br>
dissolved into 50% isopropyl alcohol/deionized water (30 mL)<br>
and gently heated on a steam bath until a solution was<br>
obtained. To the solution was added deionized water (22 mL)<br>
and the solution was allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
The product slurry is further cooled to 0°C. The product<br>
was isolated by filtration, washed with cold deionized water<br>
(2 x 15 mL), and dried in vacuo at 50°C to constant weight<br>
to provide F-III.<br>

70:30 methanol: 0.01 N sulfuric acid; flow 1.5 ml/min;<br>
detector 300 run). Isopropanol (10.28 kg) is added while<br>
maintaining the reaction temperature between -10 and -2 0°C.<br>
The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 0 to 45 minutes. The<br>
crude reaction product is isolated by adding the reaction<br>
mixture to an additional 105 L of water, pre-cooled to 2 to<br>
7°C while maintaining the reaction temperature at 2 to 7°C.<br>
The addition is followed by a methylene chloride rinse (20<br>
L) pre-cooled to 7 to 2°C. The crystalline slurry is<br>
stirred for 2 to 3 hours and filtered and sequentially<br>
washed with methylene chloride (26 kg) pre-cooled to 7 to<br>
2°C and water (53 L) pre-cooled to 7 to 2°C. The crude wet<br>
cake is combined with water (42 L) and isopropanol (40 L)<br>
and heated to 65 to 70°C to effect dissolution. The hot<br>
solution is filtered. The filtration is followed with a<br>
rinse consisting of a mixture of isopropanol (20 L) and<br>
water (21 L) heated to 65 to 70°C and a rinse consisting of<br>
water (126 L) pre-heated to 65 to 70°C. The solution is<br>
cooled to 40 to 45°C, seeded and stirred at this temperature<br>
for 2 to 3 hours to allow crystal growth. The slurry is<br>
cooled to 0 to 5°C, stirred for 3 to 4 hours and filtered.<br>
The filter cake is washed with water (122.6L) pre-cooled to<br>
2 to 7°C. The product is vacuum dried at a maximum<br>
temperature of 5 0°C until the change in cake weight was less<br>
than 0.05 kgs over a 2-4 hour period. Yield: 8.468 kgs<br>

10% Pd/C (5.6 g slurried in 22 ml of water) was added with a<br>
5 ml water rinse. The resulting slurry was evacuated and<br>
overlaid with 60 psi of hydrogen. The reaction temperature<br>
was adjusted to 30°C. After 2 hours, 10% Pd/C (5.6 g) of<br>
was added with water (30 ml). Hydrogenation at 60 psi and<br>
30°C was continued for an additional 22 hours. An<br>
additional 4.40 g of 10% Pd/C in 30 ml water was added and<br>
hydrogenation at 60 psi and 3 0°C continued for an additional<br>
2.5 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration and the<br>
pH of the filtrate was adjusted to 7.24 with 50% sodium<br>
hydroxide. Sodium chloride (8.66 g) dissolved in water (18<br>
ml) was added and the biphasic solution stirred for 3 0<br>
minutes. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase<br>
was back extracted with 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The<br>
organic phases were combined and concentrated by atmospheric<br>
distillation to a volume of 50 ml. To the concentrate at<br>
24°C was added methanol, 180 ml over a 1 hour period. The<br>
resulting crystalline slurry was stirred for 30 minutes at<br>
24°C, cooled to 0°C and stirred for 1 hour. The solids were<br>
isolated by filtration and washed sequentially with 39 ml of<br>
water and 39 ml of methanol followed by vacuum drying<br>
overnight at 50°C. Yield 15.52 g (67.8%)<br>
Isopropanol (33 ml), water (66 ml) and 10 g of solid<br>
isolated from above were combined. To the stirred mixture<br>
at 25°C is added 1.8 M HCl (21 ml). The solids quickly<br>
dissolved followed by re-precipitation of the hydrochloride<br>
salt. After stirring for 30 minutes, the slurry was heated<br>
to 70°C to effect dissolution of all of the solids. The<br>
solution was cooled to 60°C and 33 ml of water added. The<br>
resulting solution was cooled to 25°C over a 3 hour period<br>
during which time the hydrochloride salt precipitated. The<br>
slurry was stirred for approximately 3 hours at 2 5°C,<br>
filtered, washed with water (30 ml) and vacuum dried<br>
overnight at 50°C to yield 8.9 g (82.7%) of F-III. HPLC<br>

Utilities<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount" means an<br>
amount of F-III that is capable of inhibiting conditions, or<br>
detrimental effects thereof, described herein. When F-III<br>
is co-administered with estrogen, progestin, an aromatase<br>
inhibitor, an LHRH analogue, or an AChE inhibitor, the term<br>
"effective amount" also means an amount of such an agent<br>
capable of producing its intended effect.<br>
The terms "inhibiting" and "inhibit" include their<br>
generally accepted meaning, i.e., preventing, prohibiting,<br>
restraining, alleviating, ameliorating, slowing, stopping,<br>
or reversing the progression or severity of a pathological<br>
condition, or sequela thereof, described herein.<br>
The terms "preventing", "prevention of", "prophylaxis",<br>
"prophylactic" and "prevent" are used herein interchangeably<br>
and refer to reducing the likelihood that the recipient of<br>
F-III will incur or develop any of the pathological<br>
conditions, or sequela thereof, described herein.<br>
The terms "estrogen deprived" and "estrogen<br>
deprivation" refer to a condition, either naturally<br>
occurring or clinically induced, where a woman can not<br>
produce sufficient endogenous estrogenic hormones to<br>
maintain estrogen dependent functions, e.g., menses,<br>
homeostasis of bone mass, neuronal function, cardiovascular<br>
condition, etc. Such estrogen deprived situations arise<br>
from, but are not limited to, menopause and surgical or<br>
chemical ovarectomy, including its functional equivalent,<br>
e.g., medication with an aromatase inhibitor, GnRH agonists<br>
or antagonists, ICI 182780, and the like. Disease states<br>
associated with an estrogen deprived state include, but are<br>
not limited to: bone loss, osteoporosis, cardiovascular<br>
disease and hyperlipidemia.<br>
As used herein, the term "estrogen" includes steroidal<br>
compounds having estrogenic activity such as, for example,<br>
17|3-estradiol, estrone, conjugated estrogen (Premarin®) ,<br>
equine estrogen 170-ethynyl estradiol, and the like. A<br>
preferred estrogen-based compound is Premarin®, and<br>
norethylnodrel.<br>
As used herein, the term "progestin" includes compounds<br>
having progestational activity such as, for example,<br>
progesterone, norethylnodrel, nongestrel, megestrol acetate,<br>
norethindrone, and the like. Norethindrone is a preferred<br>
progestin-based agent.<br>
As used herein the term "aromatase inhibitor" includes<br>
compounds capable of inhibiting aromatase, for example<br>
commercially available inhibitors such as aminoglutemide<br>
(CYTANDREN®), Anastrazole (ARIMIDEX®), Letrozole (FEMARA®) ,<br>
Formestane (LENATRON®) , Exemestane (AROMASIN®) , and the<br>
like.<br>
As used herein, the term "LHRH analogue" refers to an<br>
analogue of lutenizing hormone releasing hormone that<br>
inhibits estrogen production in a premenopausal women<br>
including for example, goserlin (ZOLADEX®), leuprolide<br>
(LUPRON®) and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term "AChE inhibitor" includes<br>
compounds that inhibit acetyl choline esterase, for example,<br>
physostigmine salicylate, tacrine hydrochloride, donepezil<br>
hydrochloride and the like.<br>
The term "up-regulate ChAT" refers to increasing the<br>
enzymatic activity of ChAT, i.e., promoting the conversion<br>
of choline to acetyl choline. This promotion would include<br>
an increase in the efficiency and/or rate of reaction of<br>
ChAT and choline and/or an increase in the amount of ChAT<br>
present at the site of action. This increase in the amount<br>
of enzyme present may be due to gene regulation or other<br>
synthetic step of the enzyme's formation and/or a decrease<br>
in the enzyme's de-activation and metabolism.<br>
Selected Testing Procedures<br>
General Rat Preparation Procedure: Seventy-five day old<br>
(unless otherwise indicated) female Sprague Dawley rats<br>
(weight range of 200 to 225g) are obtained from Charles<br>
River Laboratories (Portage, MI). The animals are either<br>
bilaterally ovariectomized (OVX) or exposed to a Sham<br>
surgical procedure at Charles River Laboratories, and then<br>
shipped after one week. Upon arrival, they are housed in<br>
metal hanging cages in groups of 3 or 4 per cage and have ad<br>
libitum access to food (calcium content approximately 0.5%)<br>
and water for one week. Room temperature is maintained at<br>
22.2° ± 1.7°C with a minimum relative humidity of 40%. The<br>
photoperiod in the room was 12 hours light and 12 hours<br>
dark.<br>
Dosing Regimen Tissue Collection: After a one week<br>
acclimation period (therefore, two weeks post-OVX) daily<br>
dosing with F-III is initiated. 17a-ethynyl estradiol or<br>
F-III is given orally, unless otherwise stated, as a<br>
suspension in 1% carboxymethylcellulose or dissolved in 20%<br>
cyclodextrin. Animals are dosed daily for 4 days.<br>
Following the dosing regimen, animals are weighed and<br>
anesthetized with a ketamine: Xylazine (2:1, v:v) mixture<br>
and a blood sample is collected by cardiac puncture. The<br>
animals are then sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO2, the<br>
uterus is removed through a midline incision, and a wet<br>
uterine weight is determined. 17a-ethynyl estradiol is<br>
obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO.<br>
Cardiovascular Disease/Hyperlipidemia<br>
The blood samples from above are allowed to clot at<br>
room temperature for 2 hours, and serum is obtained<br>
following centrifugation for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. Serum<br>
cholesterol is determined using a Boehringer Mannheim<br>
Diagnostics high performance cholesterol assay. Briefly the<br>
cholesterol is oxidized to cholest-4-en-3-one and hydrogen<br>
peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide is then reacted with phenol<br>
and 4-aminophenazone in the presence of peroxidase to<br>
produce a p-quinone imine dye, which is read<br>
spectrophotemetrically at 500 nm. Cholesterol concentration<br>
is then calculated against a standard curve. The entire<br>
assay is automated using a Biomek Automated Workstation.<br>
Uterine Eosinophil Peroxidase (EPO) Assay<br>
The uteri from above are kept at 4°C until time of<br>
enzymatic analysis. The uteri are then homogenized in 50<br>
volumes of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH - 8.0) containing 0.005%<br>
Triton X-100. Upon addition of 0.01% hydrogen peroxide and<br>
10 mM O-phenylenediamine (final concentrations) in Tris<br>
buffer, increase in absorbance is monitored for one minute<br>
at 450 nm. The presence of eosonophils in the uterus is an<br>
indication of estrogenic activity of a compound. The<br>
maximal velocity of a 15 second interval is determined over<br>
the initial, linear portion of the reaction curve.<br>
Inhibition of Bone Loss (Osteoporosis) Test Procedure<br>
Following the general preparation procedure described<br>
above, the rats are treated daily for thirty-five days (6<br>
rats per treatment group) and sacrificed by carbon dioxide<br>
asphyxiation on the 36th day. The thirty-five day time<br>
period is sufficient to allow maximal reduction in bone<br>
density, measured as described herein. At the time of<br>
sacrifice, the uteri are removed, dissected free of<br>
extraneous tissue, and the fluid contents are expelled<br>
before determination of wet weight in order to confirm<br>
estrogen deficiency associated with complete ovariectomy.<br>
Uterine weight is routinely reduced about 75% in response to<br>
ovariectomy. The uteri are then placed in 10% neutral<br>
buffered formalin to allow for subsequent histological<br>
analysis.<br>
The right femurs are excised and digitilized X-rays<br>
generated and analyzed by an image analysis program (NIH<br>
image) at the distal metaphysis. The proximal aspect of the<br>
tibiae from these animals are also scanned by quantitative<br>
computed tomography. In accordance with the above<br>
procedures, F-III or ethynyl estradiol (EE2) in 20%<br>
hydroxypropyl b-cyclodextrin are orally administered to test<br>
animals. F-III is also useful in combination with estrogen<br>
or progestin.<br>
MCF-7 Proliferation Assay<br>
MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC HTB 22) are<br>
maintained in MEM (minimal essential medium, phenol red-<br>
free, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum (FBS) (V/V) , L-glutamine (2 inM) , sodium<br>
pyruvate (1 mM), HEPES {(N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-<br>
ethanesulfonic acid]10 mM}, non-essential amino acids and<br>
bovine insulin (1 ug/mL) (maintenance medium). Ten days<br>
prior to assay, MCF-7 cells are switched to maintenance<br>
medium supplemented with 10% dextran coated charcoal<br>
stripped fetal bovine serum (DCC-FBS) assay medium) in place<br>
of 10% FBS to deplete internal stores of steroids. MCF-7<br>
cells are removed from maintenance flasks using cell<br>
dissociation medium (Ca++/Mg++ free HBSS (phenol red-free)<br>
supplemented with 10 mM HEPES and 2 mM EDTA). Cells are<br>
washed twice with assay medium and adjusted to 80,000<br>
cells/mL. Approximately 100 mL (8,000 cells) are added to<br>
flat-bottom microculture wells (Costar 3596) and incubated<br>
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 48 hours to<br>
allow for cell adherence and equilibration after transfer.<br>
Serial dilutions of drugs or DMSO as a diluent control are<br>
prepared in assay medium and 50 mL transferred to triplicate<br>
microcultures followed by 50 mL assay medium for a final<br>
volume of 200 mL. After an additional 48 hours at 37°C in a<br>
5% CO2 humidified incubator, microcultures are pulsed with<br>
tritiated thymidine (1 uCi/well) for 4 hours. Cultures are<br>
terminated by freezing at -70°C for 24 hours followed by<br>
thawing and harvesting of microcultures using a Skatron<br>
Semiautomatic Cell Harvester. Samples are counted by liquid<br>
scintillation using a Wallac BetaPlace b counter.<br>
DMBA-Induced Mammary Tumor Inhibition<br>
Estrogen-dependent mammary tumors are produced in<br>
female Sprague-Dawley rats which are purchased from Harlan<br>
Industries, Indianapolis, Indiana. At about 55 days of age,<br>
the rats receive a single oral feeding of 20 mg of 7,12-<br>
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). About 6 weeks after DMBA<br>
administration, the mammary glands are palpated at weekly<br>
intervals for the appearance of tumors. Whenever one or<br>
more tumors appear, the longest and shortest diameters of<br>
each tumor are measured with a metric caliper, the<br>
measurements are recorded, and that animal is selected for<br>
experimentation. An attempt is made to uniformly distribute<br>
the various sizes of tumors in the treated and control<br>
groups such that average-sized tumors are equivalently<br>
distributed between test groups. Control groups and test<br>
groups for each experiment contain 5 to 9 animals.<br>
F-III is administered either through intraperitoneal<br>
injections in 2% acacia, or orally. Orally administered<br>
compounds are either dissolved or suspended in 0.2 mL corn<br>
oil. Each treatment, including acacia and corn oil control<br>
treatments, is administered once daily to each test animal.<br>
Following the initial tumor measurement and selection of<br>
test animals, tumors are measured each week by the above-<br>
mentioned method. The treatment and measurements of animals<br>
continue for 3 to 5 weeks at which time the final areas of<br>
the tumors are determined. For each compound and control<br>
treatment, the change in the mean tumor area is determined.<br>
Uterine Fibrosis Test Procedures<br>
Test 1: Between 3 and 2 0 women having uterine fibrosis are<br>
administered F-III. The amount of compound administered is<br>
from 0.1 to 1000 mg/day, and the period of administration is<br>
3 months. The women are observed during the period of<br>
administration, and up to 3 months after discontinuance of<br>
administration, for effects on uterine fibrosis.<br>
Test 2: The same procedure is used as in Test 1, except the<br>
period of administration is 6 months.<br>
Test 3: The same procedure is used as in Test 1, except the<br>
period of administration is 1 year.<br>
Test 4: Prolonged estrogen stimulation is used to induce<br>
leiomyomata in sexually mature female guinea pigs. Animals<br>
are dosed with estradiol 3-5 times per week by injection for<br>
2-4 months or until tumors arise. Treatment consisting of<br>
F-III or vehicle is administered daily for 3-16 weeks and<br>
then animals are sacrificed and the uteri harvested and<br>
analyzed for tumor regression.<br>
Test 5: Tissue from human leiomyomas are implanted into the<br>
peritoneal cavity and/or uterine myometrium of sexually<br>
mature, castrated, female, nude mice. Exogenous estrogen is<br>
supplied to induce growth of the explanted tissue. In some<br>
cases, the harvested tumor cells are cultured in vitro prior<br>
to implantation. Treatment consisting of F-III or vehicle<br>
is supplied by gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16<br>
weeks and implants are removed and measured for growth or<br>
regression. At the time of sacrifice, the uteri are<br>
harvested to assess the status of the organ.<br>
Test 6: Tissue from human uterine fibroid tumors is<br>
harvested and maintained, in vitro, as primary non-<br>
transformed cultures. Surgical specimens are pushed through<br>
a sterile mesh or sieve, or alternately teased apart from<br>
surrounding tissue to produce a single cell suspension.<br>
Cells are maintained in media containing 10% serum and<br>
antibiotic. Rates of growth in the presence and absence of<br>
estrogen are determined. Cells are assayed for their<br>
ability to produce complement component C3 and their<br>
response to growth factors and growth hormone. In vitro<br>
cultures are assessed for their proliferative response<br>
following treatment with progestins, GnRH, F-III, and<br>
vehicle. Levels of steroid hormone receptors are assessed<br>
weekly to determine whether important cell characteristics<br>
are maintained in vitro. Tissue from 5-25 patients is<br>
utilized.<br>
Test 7: F-III's ability to inhibit estrogen-stimulated<br>
proliferation of leiomyoma-derived ELT cell lines is<br>
measured substantially as described in Fuchs-Young, et al.,<br>
"Inhibition of Estrogen-Stimulated Growth of Uterine<br>
Leiomyomas by Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators", Mol.<br>
Car., 17(3):151-159 (1996), the teachings of which are<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Endometriosis Test Procedures<br>
Test 1: Twelve to thirty adult CD strain female rats are<br>
used as test animals. They are divided into three groups of<br>
equal numbers. The estrous cycle of all animals is<br>
monitored. On the day of proestrus, surgery is performed on<br>
each female. Females in each group have the left uterine<br>
horn removed, sectioned into small squares, and the squares<br>
are loosely sutured at various sites adjacent to the<br>
mesenteric blood flow. In addition, females in Group 2 have<br>
the ovaries removed. On the day following surgery, animals<br>
in Groups 1 and 2 receive intraperitoneal injections of<br>
water for 14 days whereas animals in Group 3 receive<br>
intraperitoneal injections of 1.0 mg of F-III per kilogram<br>
of body weight for the same duration. Following 14 days of<br>
treatment, each female is sacrificed and the endometrial<br>
explants, adrenals, remaining uterus, and ovaries, where<br>
applicable, are removed and prepared for histological<br>
examination. The ovaries and adrenals are weighed.<br>
Test 2: Twelve to thirty adult CD strain female rats are<br>
used as test animals. They are divided into two equal<br>
groups. The estrous cycle of all animals is monitored. On<br>
the day of proestrus, surgery is performed on each female.<br>
Females in each group have the left uterine horn removed,<br>
sectioned into small squares, and the squares are loosely<br>
sutured at various sites adjacent to the mesenteric blood<br>
flow. Approximately 50 days following surgery, animals<br>
assigned to Group 1 receive intraperitoneal injections of<br>
water for 21 days whereas animals in Group 2 receive<br>
intraperitoneal injections of 1.0 mg of F-III per kilogram<br>
of body weight for the same duration. Following 21 days of<br>
treatment, each female is sacrificed and the endometrial<br>
explants and adrenals are removed and weighed. The explants<br>
are measured as an indication of growth. Estrous cycles are<br>
monitored.<br>
Test 3: Autographs of endometrial tissue are used to induce<br>
endometriosis in rats and/or rabbits. Female animals at<br>
reproductive maturity undergo bilateral oophorectomy, and<br>
estrogen is supplied exogenously thus providing a specific<br>
and constant level of hormone. Autologous endometrial<br>
tissue is implanted in the peritoneum of 5-150 animals and<br>
estrogen supplied to induce growth of the explanted tissue.<br>
Treatment consisting of a compound of the present invention<br>
is supplied by gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16<br>
weeks, and implants are removed and measured for growth or<br>
regression. At the time of sacrifice, the intact horn of<br>
the uterus is harvested to assess status of endometrium.<br>
Test 4: Tissue from human endometrial lesions is implanted<br>
into the peritoneum of sexually mature, castrated, female,<br>
nude mice. Exogenous estrogen is supplied to induce growth<br>
of the explanted tissue. In some cases, the harvested<br>
endometrial cells are cultured in vitro prior to<br>
implantation. Treatment consisting of F-III supplied by<br>
gastric lavage on a daily basis for 3-16 weeks, and implants<br>
are removed and measured for growth or regression. At the<br>
time of sacrifice, the uteri are harvested to assess the<br>
status of the intact endometrium.<br>
Test 5: Tissue from human endometrial lesions is harvested<br>
and maintained in vitro as primary non-transformed cultures.<br>
Surgical specimens are pushed through a sterile mesh or<br>
sieve, or alternately teased apart from surrounding tissue<br>
to produce a single cell suspension. Cells are maintained<br>
in media containing 10% serum and antibiotic. Rates of<br>
growth in the presence and absence of estrogen are<br>
determined. Cells are assayed for their ability to produce<br>
complement component C3 and their response to growth factors<br>
and growth hormone. In vitro cultures are assessed for<br>
their proliferative response following treatment with<br>
progestins, GnRH, F-III, and vehicle. Levels of steroid<br>
hormone receptors are assessed weekly to determine whether<br>
important cell characteristics are maintained in vitro.<br>
Tissue from 5-25 patients is utilized.<br>
CNS Disorders Including Alzheimer's Disease<br>
Estrogens, such as 17b-estradiol, regulate gene<br>
transcription by binding to estrogen receptors (ER) which<br>
reside in the cytoplasm of certain cell populations. Ligand<br>
activation of the ER is a prerequisite for nuclear transport<br>
of the complex where binding to a 13 base-pair palindromic<br>
DNA consensus sequence (estrogen response element, or ERE)<br>
begins assembly of a transcriptional apparatus which<br>
culminates in the activation of appropriate target genes. A<br>
variety of genes have been identified which are regulated by<br>
estrogen. These include cytoskeletal proteins, neuro-<br>
transmitter biosynthetic and metabolic enzymes and<br>
receptors, as well as other hormones and neuropeptides.<br>
ERE's have been identified in many estrogen-responsive genes<br>
including vitellogenin, c-fos, prolactin, and luteinizing<br>
hormone.<br>
Of significance in the central nervous system, ERE-like<br>
sequences have been identified in p75ngr and trkA, both of<br>
which serve as signaling molecules for the neurotrophins:<br>
nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived nerve growth factor<br>
(BDNGF), and neurotrophin-3.<br>
BDNF as well as NGF have been shown to promote the<br>
survival of cholinergic neurons in culture. It is<br>
postulated that if the interactions between neurotrophins<br>
and estrogens are important, for the development and survival<br>
of basal forebrain neurons (which degenerate in Alzheimer's<br>
disease) then clinical conditions in which an estrogen<br>
deficiency exists (as after menopause) may contribute to a<br>
loss of these neurons.<br>
The following experiment is conducted in ovariectomized<br>
rats (prepared as described above) to determine the<br>
similarities and/or differences between F-III and estrogen<br>
at affecting gene expression in various brain regions. Six<br>
week old rats are dosed daily with subcutaneous injections<br>
of estradiol benzoate (0.03 mg/kg), F-III or vehicle<br>
(control). After five weeks of treatment, animals are<br>
sacrificed and their brains removed and hippocampi collected<br>
by microdissection. The hippocampi are fast frozen in<br>
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Total RNA is prepared<br>
from pooled tissue from the appropriate treatment and<br>
control groups and reverse transcribed using a 3'<br>
oligonucleotide primer which is selected for specific mRNA<br>
(poly-A+) populations. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) are<br>
carried out in a cocktail consisting of: random 5'<br>
oligonucleotides (10 base-pairs in length; total of 150),<br>
reaction buffer, Taq polymerase, and a 32PdTCP.<br>
After 40 rounds of amplification, the reaction products<br>
are size fractionated on a 6% TBE-urea gel, dried and<br>
exposed to X-ray film. The resulting mRNA display patterns<br>
are compared between treatment groups.<br>
Use of F-III in Conjunction with Estrogen<br>
Peri- and post-menopausal women often undergo hormone<br>
replacement therapy (HRT) to combat negative consequences<br>
associated with the drop in circulating endogenous estrogen,<br>
e.g., to treat hot flashes. However, HRT has been<br>
associated with increased risks of certain cancers including<br>
uterine and breast cancer. F-III may be employed in<br>
conjunction with HRT to inhibit these risks.<br>
Use of F-III in Conjunction With an Aromatase Inhibitor<br>
By definition, the ovaries of a postmenopausal woman<br>
are not functioning. Her only source of estrogen is through<br>
conversion of adrenal androgens to estrogens by the enzyme<br>
aromatase, which is found in peripheral tissues (including<br>
fat, muscle and the breast tumor itself). Thus, drugs that<br>
inhibit aromatase (aromatase inhibitors) deplete the<br>
postmenopausal woman of circulating estrogen. Estrogen<br>
deprivation by means of aromatase inhibition is an important<br>
treatment option for patients with metastatic breast cancer.<br>
During therapy with an aromatase inhibitor, lack of<br>
circulating estrogen may cause negative, unintended side-<br>
effects, for example on serum lipid levels. F-III may be<br>
employed to inhibit these negative effects.<br>
Use of F-III in Conjunction with a LHRH Analogue<br>
Continuous exposure to a LHRH (lutenizing hormone<br>
releasing hormone) analogue inhibits estrogen production in<br>
the premenopausal women by desensitizing the pituitary<br>
gland, which then no longer stimulates the ovaries to<br>
produce estrogen. The clinical effect is a "medical<br>
oophrectomy" which is reversible upon cessation of the LHRH<br>
analogue. During therapy with a LHRH analogue, lack of<br>
circulating estrogen may cause negative, unintended side-<br>
effects, for example on serum lipid levels. F-III may be<br>
employed to inhibit these negative effects.<br>
Increasing Levels of Acetyl Choline<br>
It is known that patients suffering from Alzheimer's<br>
disease have a markedly smaller level of cholinergic neurons<br>
in the hippocampus than their non-Alzheimer peers. The<br>
progressive loss of these cholinergic neurons appears to<br>
mirror the progressive loss in memory and cognitive function<br>
in these patients. It is thought that one reason for the<br>
decline of these neurons is the loss or decreased function<br>
of the neurotransmitter, acetyl choline.<br>
The level of acetylcholine in a neuron is basically<br>
determined by where the equilibrium between its bio-<br>
synthesis and bio-degradation lies. The enzyme choline<br>
acetyltransferase (ChAT) is primarily responsible for its<br>
synthesis and acetylcholineesterase (AChE) for its<br>
degradation.<br>
In the order to determine F-III's effect on levels of<br>
ChAT, the following experiment is performed: Following the<br>
general rat preparation procedure described above, 40 rats<br>
are dosed daily by subcutaneous injection or oral gavage<br>
with F-III at 3 mg/kg/day in a vehicle containing 10%<br>
cyclodextrin, estradiol benzoate at 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/day,<br>
or vehicle control. Animals are treated for 3 or 10 days.<br>
There are twenty animals per each dosing regimen. At the<br>
appropriate time intervals, the animals are sacrificed and<br>
their brains dissected. The particular portions of the<br>
brains are homogenized and assayed. Homogenates from the<br>
hippocampus and frontal cortex were processed and<br>
determination of ChAT activity is made by a radio-labelled<br>
assay of the bio-synthesis of acetyl choline. This<br>
procedure may be found in Schoepp et al., J. Neural<br>
Transmiss., 78:183-193, 1989, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
As expected, in the OVX animals, ChAT levels are<br>
reduced &gt;5 0% (p
controls.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, F-III<br>
is used in combination with an AChE inhibitor. Use of an<br>
AChE inhibitor increases levels of acetylcholine by blocking<br>
its degradation via inhibition of AChE.<br>
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)<br>
For background on the link between estrogen action and<br>
treatment of BPH and prostate carcinoma, see PCT Application<br>
No. WO 98/07274, International Publication Date: October 15,<br>
1998.<br>
In the experiments described below, the ability of F-<br>
III to bind at estrogen receptors in several human prostatic<br>
cancer cell lines is evaluated.<br>
Lysates of the LNCaP, DU-45 and PC-3 human prostatic<br>
cancer cell lines are prepared in a TEG medium comprising 50<br>
nM Tris?HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA) 0.4 M KC1, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM 2-ME, and 10 mM<br>
sodium molybdate further containing the protease inhibitors<br>
pepstatin (1 mg/mL), leupeptin (2 mg/mL), aprotinin (5<br>
mg/mL) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 0.1 mM)<br>
(TEGP).<br>
The cell lysates are centrifuged and the pellets<br>
resuspended in cold TEGP (1 mL TEGP/100 mg of pellet) and<br>
sonicated for 30 seconds (duty cycle 70%, output 1.8) on a<br>
Branson Model 450 Sonifier.. Lysates are pelleted by<br>
centrifugation at 10,000 x G for 15 minutes at 4°C after<br>
which the supernates are withdrawn and either used<br>
immediately or stored at -7 0°C.<br>
Competitive Binding Assay: The binding buffer is TEG in<br>
which the 0.4 M KC1 is replaced by 50 mM NaCl and to which 1<br>
mg/mL of ovalbumin had been further added (TEGO). F-III is<br>
diluted to 20 nM in TEGO from which 3-fold serial dilutions<br>
are prepared. Assays are performed in round-bottom<br>
polyprolylene microplates in triplicate microwells. Each<br>
well receives 35 mL of tritiated 17|3-estradiol (0.5 nM,<br>
specific activity 60.1 Ci/mmol, DuPont-New England Nuclear,<br>
Boston, MA) and 35 mL of cold competitot test compound (0.1<br>
nM - 5 mM) or TEGO, and following incubation for 5 minutes<br>
at 4°C with shaking, 70 mL of MCF-7 cell line lysate.<br>
Plates are incubated for 24 hours at 4°C after which<br>
time 7 0 mL of dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) is added to each<br>
well followed by vigorous shaking for 8 minutes at 4°C. The<br>
plates are then centrifuged at 1500 x G for 10 minutes at<br>
4°C. Supernate is harvested from each well into a flexible<br>
polystyrene microplate for scintillation counting in a<br>
Wallac Micobeta Model 1450 counter. Radioactivity is<br>
expressed as disintegrations per minute (DPM) after<br>
correcting for counting efficiency (35-40%) and background.<br>
Additional controls are total counts and total counts + DCC<br>
to defined the lower limit of DCC extractable counts. The<br>
results of these competitive binding assays are expressed as<br>
mean percent bound (% Bound) +/- standard deviation using<br>
the formula:<br>
DPMtest compound ~ DPMtotal count + DCC<br>
% Bound = ------------------------------------------------------- x 100<br>
DPMno test compound ~ DPMtotai count + DCC<br>
Prevention of Breast Cancer<br>
This invention also relates to the administration of F-<br>
III to a recipient who is at risk of developing de novo<br>
breast cancer. The term "de novo", as used herein, means<br>
the lack of transformation or metamorphosis of normal breast<br>
cells to cancerous or malignant cells in the first instance.<br>
Such a transformation may occur in stages in the same or<br>
daughter cells via an evolutionary process or may occur in a<br>
single, pivotal event. This de novo process is in contrast<br>
to the metastasis, colonization, or spreading of already<br>
transformed or malignant cells from the primary tumor site<br>
to new locations.<br>
A person who is at no particular risk of developing<br>
breast cancer is one who may develop de novo breast cancer,<br>
has no evidence or suspicion of the potential of the disease<br>
above normal risk, and who has never had a diagnosis of<br>
having the disease. The greatest risk factor contributing<br>
to the development of breast carcinoma is a personal history<br>
of suffering from the disease, or an earlier occurrence of<br>
the disease, even if it is in remission with no evidence of<br>
its presence. Another risk factor is family history of the<br>
disease.<br>
Induction of mammary tumors in rats by administration<br>
of the carcinogen N-nitroso-N-methylurea is a well-accepted<br>
animal model for the study of breast cancer and has been<br>
found suitable for analyzing the effect of chemopreventive<br>
agents.<br>
In two separate studies, 55-day old female Sprague-<br>
Dawley rats are given an intravenous (Study 1) or<br>
intraperitoneal (Study 2) dose of 50 mg of N-nitroso-N-<br>
methylurea per kilogram of body weight one week prior to<br>
feeding ad libitum a diet into which varying amounts of F-<br>
III, (Z)-2-[4-(1,2-diphenyl-l-butenyl)phenoxy]-N, N-<br>
dimethylethanamine base (tamoxifen base), or control are<br>
blended.<br>
In Study 1, the dietary doses of 60 mg/kg of diet and<br>
2 0 mg/kg of diet translates into roughly comparable doses of<br>
3 and 1 mg/kg of body weight for the test animals.<br>
In Study 2, the dietary doses of 20, 6, 2, and 0.6<br>
mg/kg of diet translates roughly into comparable doses of 1,<br>
0.3, 0.1 and 0.03 mg/kg of body weight for the test animals.<br>
Rats are observed for evidence of toxicity and are<br>
weighed and palpated for tumor formation once a week. The<br>
animals are sacrificed after thirteen weeks (Study 1) or<br>
eighteen weeks (Study 2) and tumors are confirmed and<br>
weighed at autopsy.<br>
Formulations<br>
The term "pharmaceutical" when used herein as an<br>
adjective means substantially non-deleterious to the<br>
recipient mammal. By "pharmaceutical formulation" it is<br>
meant the carrier, diluent, excipients and active<br>
ingredient(s) must be compatible with the other ingredients<br>
of the formulation, and not deleterious to the recipient<br>
thereof.<br>
F-III is preferably formulated prior to administration.<br>
The selection of the formulation should be decided by the<br>
attending physician taking into considerations the same<br>
factors involved with determining the effective amount.<br>
The total active ingredients in such formulations<br>
comprises from 0.1% to 99.9% by weight of the formulation.<br>
Preferably, no more than two active ingredients are<br>
contained in said formulation. That is, it is preferred to<br>
formulate F-III with a second active ingredient selected<br>
from an estrogen, progestin, aromatase inhibitor, LHRH<br>
analogue and AChE inhibitor. Most preferred formulations<br>
are those where F-III is the sole active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention<br>
are prepared by procedures known in the art using well known<br>
and readily available ingredients. For example, F-III,<br>
either alone, or in combination with an estrogen, progestin,<br>
aromatase inhibitor, LHRH analogue, or an AChE inhibitor<br>
compound, are formulated with common excipients, diluents,<br>
or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, suspensions,<br>
solutions, injectables, aerosols, powders, and the like.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for<br>
parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous or non-<br>
aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions,<br>
as well as sterile powders which are reconstituted<br>
immediately prior to use into sterile solutions or<br>
suspensions. Examples of suitable sterile aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include<br>
water, physiological saline solution, ethanol, polyols (such<br>
as glycerol, propylene glycol, poly(ethylene glycol), and<br>
the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils<br>
(such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as<br>
ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity is maintained, for example,<br>
by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the<br>
maintenance of proper particle size in the case of<br>
dispersions and suspensions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
Parenteral compositions may also contain adjuvants such<br>
as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and<br>
dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms is ensured by the inclusion of antibacterial<br>
and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol,<br>
phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable<br>
to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride,<br>
and the like. Prolonged absorption of injectable<br>
formulations may be brought about by the inclusion of agents<br>
which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and<br>
gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the<br>
drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug<br>
following subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may<br>
be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of<br>
crystalline material of low water solubility or by<br>
dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. In the<br>
case of the subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of a<br>
suspension containing a form of the drug with low water<br>
solubility, the rate of absorption of the drug depends upon<br>
its rate of dissolution.<br>
Injectable "depot" formulations of F-III are made by<br>
forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in<br>
biodegradable polymers such as poly(lactic acid),<br>
poly(glycolic acid), copolymers of lactic and glycolic acid,<br>
poly (orthoesters), and poly (anhydrides) these materials<br>
which are described in the art. Depending upon the ratio of<br>
drug to polymer and the characteristics of the particular<br>
polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be<br>
controlled.<br>
Injectable formulations are sterilized, for example, by<br>
filtration through bacterial-retaining filters, or by<br>
presterilization of the components of the mixture prior to<br>
their admixture, either at the time of manufacture or just<br>
prior to administration (as in the example of a dual chamber<br>
syringe package).<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include<br>
capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such<br>
solid dosage forms, F-III is mixed with at least one inert,<br>
pharmaceutical carrier such as sodium citrate, or dicalcium<br>
phosphate, and/or (a) fillers or extenders such as starches,<br>
sugars including lactose and glucose, mannitol, and silicic<br>
acid, (b) binding agents such as carboxymethyl-cellulose and<br>
other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin,<br>
poly(vinylpyrrolidine), sucrose and acacia, (c) humectants<br>
such as glycerol, (d) disintegrating agents such as agar-<br>
agar, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potato or<br>
tapioca starch, alginic acid, silicates and sodium<br>
carbonate, (e) moisturizing agents such as glycerol; (f)<br>
solution retarding agents such as paraffin, (g) absorption<br>
accelerating agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds,<br>
(h) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerin<br>
monostearate, (i) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite<br>
clay, and (j) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, solid poly(ethylene glycols), sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of<br>
capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also<br>
contain buffering agents.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also comprise<br>
the fill in soft or hard gelatin capsules using excipients<br>
such as lactose as well as high molecular weight<br>
poly(ethylene glycols) and the like.<br>
Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules,<br>
pills and granules can also be prepared with coatings or<br>
shells such as enteric coatings or other coatings well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical formulating art. The coatings may<br>
contain opacifying agents or agents which release the active<br>
ingredient(s) in a particular part of the digestive tract,<br>
as for example, acid soluble coatings for release of the<br>
active ingredient(s) in the stomach, or base soluble<br>
coatings for release of the active ingredient(s) in the<br>
intestinal tract.<br>
The active ingredient(s) may also be microencapsulated<br>
in a sustained-release coaling, with the microcapsules being<br>
made part of a pill of capsule formulation.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of F-III<br>
include solution, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active components, liquid<br>
formulations may include inert diluents commonly used in the<br>
art such as water or other pharmaceutical solvents,<br>
solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol,<br>
benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol,<br>
dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, ground<br>
nut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, poly(ethylene glycols), fatty<br>
acid esters of sorbitol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the liquid oral formulations<br>
may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents,<br>
emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening,<br>
flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
Liquid suspension, in addition to the active<br>
ingredient(s) may contain suspending agents such as<br>
ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol<br>
and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum<br>
metahydroxide, bentonite clay, agar-agar, and tragacanth,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
Compositions for rectal or intravaginal administration<br>
are prepared by mixing F-III with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or any<br>
suppository wax which is a solid at room temperature, but<br>
liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum<br>
or vaginal cavity to release the active component(s). The<br>
compounds are dissolved in the melted wax, formed into the<br>
desired shape, and allowed to harden into the finished<br>
suppository formulation.<br>
F-III may also be administered in the form of<br>
liposomes. As is know in the art, liposomes are generally<br>
derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances.<br>
Lipososome formulations are formed by mono- or multilamellar<br>
hydrated liquid crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous<br>
medium. Any non-toxic, pharmaceutical, and metabolizable<br>
lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present<br>
compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to F-<br>
III, stabilizers, excipients, preservatives, and the like.<br>
The preferred lipids are phospholipids and the phosphatidyl<br>
cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic.<br>
Methods for forming liposomes are know in the art as<br>
described, for example, in Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell<br>
Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N. Y. (1976),<br>
p. 33 efc seq.<br>
The following formulation examples are illustrative<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
The formulation above may be changed in compliance with the<br>
reasonable variations provided.<br>
A tablet formulation is prepared using the ingredients<br>
below:<br>
The components are blended and compressed to form tablets.<br>
Alternatively, tablets each containing 2.5 - 1000 mg of<br>
F-III are made up as follows:<br>
F-III, starch, and cellulose are passed through a No. 45<br>
mesh U.S. sieve and mixed thoroughly. The solution of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone is mixed with the resultant powders<br>
which are then passed through a No. 14 mesh U.S. sieve. The<br>
granules so produced are dried at 50°-60°C and passed<br>
through a No. 18 mesh U.S. sieve. The sodium carboxymethyl<br>
starch, magnesium stearate, and talc, previously passed<br>
through a No. 60 U.S. sieve, are then added to the granules<br>
which, after mixing, are compressed on a tablet machine to<br>
yield tablets.<br>
Suspensions each containing 0.1 - 1000 mg of medicament<br>
per 5 ml dose are made as follows:<br>
The medicament is passed through a No. 45 mesh U.S. sieve<br>
and mixed with the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and syrup<br>
to form a smooth paste. The benzoic acid solution, flavor,<br>
and color are diluted with some of the water and added, with<br>
stirring. Sufficient water is then added to produce the<br>
required volume.<br>
An aerosol solution is prepared containing the<br>
following ingredients:<br>
F-III is mixed with ethanol and the mixture added to a<br>
portion of the propellant 22, cooled to 30°C, and<br>
transferred to a filling device. The required amount is<br>
then fed to a stainless steel container and diluted with the<br>
remaining propellant. The valve units are then fitted to<br>
the container.<br>
Suppositories are prepared as follows:<br>
F-III is passed through a No. 60 mesh U.S. sieve and<br>
suspended in the saturated fatty acid glycerides previously<br>
melted using the minimal necessary heat. The mixture is<br>
then poured into a suppository mold of nominal 2 g capacity<br>
and allowed to cool.<br>
An intravenous formulation is prepared as follows:<br>
The solution of the above ingredients is intravenously<br>
administered to a patient at a rate of about 1 mL per<br>
minute.<br>
Dosage<br>
The specific dose of F-III administered according to<br>
this invention is determined by the particular circumstances<br>
surrounding each situation. These circumstances include,<br>
the route of administration, the prior medical history of<br>
the recipient, the pathological condition or symptom being<br>
treated, the severity of the condition/symptom being<br>
treated, and the age and sex of the recipient.<br>
Generally, an effective minimum daily dose of F-III is<br>
about 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg. Typically, an effective<br>
maximum dose is about 800, 100, 60, 50, or 40 mg. Most<br>
typically, the dose ranges between 15 mg and 60 mg. The<br>
exact dose may be determined, in accordance with the<br>
standard practice in the medical arts of "dose titrating"<br>
the recipient; that is, initially administering a low dose<br>
of the compound, and gradually increasing the does until the<br>
desired therapeutic effect is observed.<br>
Although it may be necessary to dose titrate the<br>
recipient with respect to the combination therapies<br>
discussed above, typical doses of active ingredients other<br>
than F-III are as follows: ethynyl estrogen (0.01 - 0.03<br>
mg/day), mestranol (0.05 - 0.15 mg/day), conjugated<br>
estrogenic hormones (e.g., Premarin®, Wyeth-Ayerst; 0.3 -<br>

Route of administration<br>
F-III can be administered by a variety of routes<br>
including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneus,<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. The method of<br>
administration of each estrogen- and progestin-based agent<br>
is consistent with that which is known in the art. F-III,<br>
alone or in combination with estrogen, progestin, or an AChE<br>
inhibitor generally will be administered in a convenient<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may<br>
be administered to humans and other mammals (e.g., dogs,<br>
cats, horses, swine and the like) orally, rectally,<br>
intravaginally, parenterally, topically, bucally or<br>
sublingually, or nasally. The term "parenteral<br>
administration" refers herein to modes of administration<br>
which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal,<br>
instrasternal, subcutaneous, or intraarticular injection or<br>
infusion.<br>
Mode/Length of Administration<br>
For the majority of the methods of the present<br>
invention, F-III is administered continuously, from 1 to 3<br>
times daily or as often as needed to deliver an effective<br>
amount of F-III to the recipient. Cyclical therapy may<br>
especially be useful in the treatment of endometriosis or<br>
may be used acutely during painful attacks of the disease.<br>
In the case of restenosis, therapy may be limited to short<br>
(1-6 months) intervals following medical procedures such as<br>
angioplasty.<br>
