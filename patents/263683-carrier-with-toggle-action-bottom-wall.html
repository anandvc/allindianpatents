				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to carriers and, more particularly, to a carrier that is<br>
reversibly erectable from a collapsed condition to an erected condition and includes a<br>
toggle-action bottom wall.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Basket style carriers are known in the art, and generally consist of a<br>
configuration that may be converted from a collapsed condition, for shipping and<br>
storage, to an erected condition for receiving and carrying articles, such as bottles.<br>
However, many of these carriers are either difficult to erect or fail to stay erected,<br>
thereby making such carriers difficult to load. In addition, articles that are drop-loaded<br>
into these carriers may be damaged when they contact the bottom wall of the carrier,<br>
which is typically set on a hard surface. Furthermore, it is sometimes desirable to<br>
provide a handle structure that is defined in multiple planes, so that the handle<br>
structure can be accessed from various vantage points. However, the composite<br>
handles provided on carriers with such a handle structure are often inconvenient or<br>
uncomfortable to use.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a carrier that can readily toggle or spring between a<br>
collapsed condition and an erected condition, and maintain its erected condition. There<br>
is also a need for a carrier that provides an inherent cushion or buffer at the bottom<br>
wall of the carrier or prevent damage to breakable articles during loading, for example,<br>
as glass bottles are drop-loaded into the carrier by automated equipment. Further, there<br>
is also a need for a carrier having a handle that is convenient and comfortable for<br>
carrying.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The various embodiments of the present invention overcome the shortcomings<br>
of the prior art by providing a carrier that is reversibly ereetable from a collapsed<br>
condition to an erected condition and that reliably maintains its erected condition. In<br>
the erected condition, the bottom wall of the carrier includes a buffer for limiting or<br>
preventing damage to articles as they are loaded into the carrier. The handle of the<br>
2<br><br>
carrier is ergonomically defined in multiple planes and includes handle flaps including<br>
curved portions that improve the comfort of a handle.<br>
Generally, the carrier includes multiple side walls that define a tubular<br>
structure, as well as a bottom wall and gusset structures that connect the bottom wall to<br>
the tubular structure. The bottom wall includes two bottom panels which are each<br>
hingedly connected to an edge of the tubular structure and which are connected in a<br>
partially overlapping arrangement to each other. Each gusset structure is hingedly<br>
connected to one of the bottom panels and to the tubular structure. According to one<br>
aspect of the invention, the arrangement of the bottom panels and the gusset structures<br>
with respect to the tubular structure yields a bottom wall that is somewhat springy so<br>
as to provide the buffer that cushions the bottoms of the articles placed in the carrier.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the carrier is partially erected,<br>
such as by inplant equipment (IPE), in such a manner as to be easily collapsed for<br>
shipping or storage. In the collapsed condition, the entire carrier is substantially<br>
flattened, having coplanar surfaces with two side edges. The carrier is fully erected<br>
simply by applying pressure, either manually or automatically, such as via out plan<br>
equipment, to each side edge of the flattened carrier. The pressure is applied in such a<br>
manner as to urge the side edges toward one another, i.e., opposing forces applied<br>
generally in alignment with the plane of the flattened carrier cause the then coplanar<br>
surfaces to spring apart to form a tubular structure, and also causes the bottom wall to<br>
spring into place, such that the bottom panels are substantially coplanar to one another<br>
and are substantially perpendicular to the sidewalk of the tubular structure. The bottom<br>
wall, in effect, encloses an open end of the tubular structure. The gusset panels are<br>
rotatable to urge the bottom panels to toggle to form the bottom wall, and to maintain<br>
the bottom wall and tubular structure in an erected condition.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, each exemplar}' carrier includes<br>
at least a first handle portion having a first handle cutout and a second handle portion<br>
having a second handle cutout The first and second handle portions are connected<br>
along a tubular axis of the tubular structure such that the handle cutouts are<br>
interconnected to define a handle aperture. The first handle portion is at an angle<br>
relative to the second handle portion such that the handle aperture is defined in<br>
3<br><br>
multiple planes. In certain embodiments, the first and second handle portions may be<br>
hingedly connected along a fold line such that the handle aperture interrupts the fold<br>
line. Each of the handle cutouts includes a handle flap. Each of the handle flaps include<br>
a curved portion which, together, define a recess that is adjacent to the tubular axis.<br>
In a first embodiment, the gusset structures each include a gusset attaching tab<br>
and a gusset panel. The gusset panel is hingedly connected to one of the bottom panels<br>
and hingedly connected to the gusset attaching tab. The outside surface of the gusset<br>
attaching tab is secured to the inside surface of the tubular structure such that the<br>
gusset panel is hingedly connected to the inside surface of the tubular structure.<br>
When the carrier is in a collapsed condition, the bottom panels, gusset<br>
structures, and side walls are substantially coplanar as described in general above.<br>
Specifically, the outside surfaces of the bottom walls are folded in a face contacting<br>
relationship with respect to one another, and the inside surface of each of the bottom<br>
walls are folded in a face contacting relationship with the inside surface of the tubular<br>
structure. The outside surface of each of the gusset panels is folded in a face contacting<br>
relationship with the inside surface of the tubular structure. The inside surface of a first<br>
gusset panel that is hingedly connected to one of the bottom panels is folded in a face<br>
contacting relationship with the inside surface of one of the second gusset panel that is<br>
hingedly connected to the other bottom panel.<br>
When the carrier is in an erected condition, the outside surface of each of the<br>
gusset panels approaches a face contacting relationship with the inside surface of the<br>
tubular structure.<br>
Overlapping portions of the bottom panels are secured together to form the<br>
bottom wall. More specifically, distal portions of the outside surfaces of the bottom<br>
panels are secured together in a face contacting arrangement. The overlapping portions<br>
extend at an angle with respect to the plane defined by the bottom wall to form a<br>
deflectable buffer. The buffer lessens the impact between articles and the bottom wall<br>
of the carrier when articles are loaded into the carrier.<br>
In a second embodiment of the invention, the gusset structures include first and<br>
second gusset panels that are hingedly connected to one another. The first gusset panel<br>
4<br><br>
is additionally hingedly connected to one of the bottom panels and the second gusset<br>
panel is hingedly connected along a portion of the bottom edge of the tubular structure.<br>
When the carrier is in a collapsed condition, the bottom panels, gusset<br>
structures, and side walls are substantially coplanar as described in general above.<br>
Specifically, the inside surfaces of the bottom walls are in a face contacting<br>
relationship and extend from an edge of the tubular structure. The inside surface of<br>
each gusset panel of a first gusset structure that is hingedly connected to one of the<br>
bottom panels is in a face contacting relationship with the inside surface of respective<br>
gusset panels of a second gusset structure that is hingedly connected to the other<br>
bottom panel.<br>
When the carrier is in an erected condition, the inside surface each of the<br>
second gusset panels approaches a face contacting relationship with the inside surface<br>
of the tubular structure and the outside surfaces of respective first and second gusset<br>
panels approach a face contacting relationship with one another. Further, the bottom<br>
panels are substantially coplanar to one another and are substantially perpendicular to<br>
the sidewalls of the tubular structure. The bottom wall, in effect, encloses an open end<br>
of the tubular structure.<br>
In this embodiment, the bottom wall may be formed by overlapping the bottom<br>
panels as described above, but is preferably formed as follows. The overlapping<br>
portions include the outside surface of the distal end of one of the bottom panels,<br>
which is secured to the inside surface of the distal end of the other bottom panel. The<br>
buffer is formed in part by providing score lines that extend across the bottom wall<br>
transversely with respect to the overlapping distal edges. The score lines terminate at<br>
the bottom edge of the tubular structure. The bottom edge of the tubular tabular<br>
structure is curved to encourage the bottom wall to bow inwardly with respect to the<br>
tubular tabular structure so as to be concave. Thus, the bottom wall tends to be at least<br>
partially suspended, or otherwise disposed above, a flat surface upon which the erected<br>
carrier rests, such that a buffer is formed there between.<br>
The foregoing has broadly outlined some of the aspects and features of the<br>
present invention, which should be construed to be merely illustrative of various<br>
5<br><br>
potential applications of the invention. Other beneficial results can be obtained by<br>

Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals indicate like elements<br>
throughout the several views, the drawings illustrate various aspects of exemplary<br>
embodiments of a basket-style carrier that is reversibly erectable from a collapsed<br>
condition to an erected condition. In the exemplary embodiments, the carriers are<br>
arranged to accommodate three cylindrical articles. However, the blank and carrier<br>
7<br><br>
may be modified to accommodate any number of bottles, cans, or other articles.<br>
Generally described, the carrier includes a tubular structure formed from multiple<br>
sidewalls, a bottom wall formed from bottom panels, and gusset structures connecting<br>
the tubular structure and the bottom wall. At least a portion of each gusset structure is<br>
rotatable such that the bottom panels toggle to form the bottom wall as the carrier is<br>
reversibly erected from a collapsed condition to an erected condition. Further, the<br>
gusset structures retain the bottom wall and tubular structure in the erected condition.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 and with occasional reference to FIG. 8, there is shown an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a blank 100, which when constructed forms a carrier 800<br>
for enclosing a plurality of articles. The blank 100 includes three primary sections of<br>
panels. Each section is indicated with dashed lines and includes panels which define<br>
the walls of a receiving cell of the carrier 800. Specifically, a first section 101 includes<br>
panels for defining a first receiving cell 810, a second section 103 includes panels for<br>
defining a second receiving cell 820, and a third section 105 includes panels for<br>
defining a third receiving cell 830. The blank 100 also includes bottom structure panels<br>
108,112. Each of the bottom structure panels 108,112 includes a bottom panel and<br>
gusset structures for forming the bottom wall of the carrier 800.<br>
The first section 101 includes major sidewall panel 118, minor sidewall panel<br>
142, major divider wall panel 122, and minor divider wall panel 132. The first section<br>
101 panels are aligned longitudinally. The divider wall panels 122,132 are separated<br>
along a severance line 134 and separated from the sidewall panels 118,142 along<br>
severance lines 124,144. The angle and curvature of the severance lines in the blank<br>
100 is a design decision which may provide aesthetic appeal or shape the sidewalls of<br>
the carrier in order to provide additional support to the articles, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment, the severance line 124 is oblique and the severance line 144 is straight.<br>
As described herein, major sidewall panels and major divider wall panels are<br>
separated by an oblique severance line. Minor sidewall panels and minor divider wall<br>
panels are separated by a straight severance line. As can be seen in FIG. 8, for a carrier<br>
800 in an erected condition, sidewalls which are defined by major sidewall panels have<br>
a greater maximum height than sidewalls defined by minor sidewall panels.<br>

Turning now to the configuration illustrated in FIG. 8, the blank 100 may be<br>
assembled to form the carrier 800 through a series of folding and securing operations.<br>
The operations may be performed in a straight line machine so that the carrier is not<br>
required to be rotated or inverted to complete the assembly. However, the folding<br>
process is not limited to the process described below and may be altered, for example,<br>
according to particular manufacturing requirements. For clarity, the application of<br>
adhesive is described as being applied as multiple assembly steps, although all<br>
adhesive may be applied simultaneously or in a single step.<br>
Initially, adhesive is applied to the inner surface of gusset attaching tabs 244,<br>
245, 274, 286, as indicated by the stippling in FIG. 1. Bottom structure panels 108,<br>
112 are then folded along fold lines 110, 250, 251 and 114, 280, 292, respectively, to<br>
be in a face contacting arrangement with the sidewall panels 118, 146,150 and 142,<br>
156, 160, respectively, as shown in FIG. 2. More particularly, gusset attaching tabs<br>
244, 245 are folded about fold lines 250, 251 and bottom panel 230 is folded along<br>
fold line 110 so that gusset attaching tabs 244, 245 are secured to sidewail panels 118,<br>
150, respectively. Likewise, gusset attaching tabs 274, 286 are folded about fold lines<br>
280, 292 and bottom panel 260 is folded about fold line 114 so that attaching tabs 274,<br>
286 are secured to sidewail panels 142,160, respectively.<br>
Adhesive is then applied to major divider wall panel 122 and minor divider<br>
wall panel 132, as shown by stippling in FIG. 2, and may optionally be applied to<br>
minor divider wall panel 170 and major divider wall panel 180. It should be noted that<br>
adhesive is preferably not applied to portions of the minor divider wall panel 132 that<br>
may contact major sidewail panel 156 when folded along fold line 158 so as to allow<br>
movement of the major sidewali panel 156 when the carrier 800 is erected.<br>
11<br><br>
The major divider wall pane! 122 is folded about fold line 151 to be in a face<br>
contacting relationship with minor divider wall panel 170. Similarly, the minor divider<br>
wall panel 132 is folded along fold lines 158 and 159 to be in a face contacting<br>
relationship with the major divider wall panel 180. Thereby, the cutout 126 overlays<br>
the cutout 192 and the cutout 136 overlays the cutout 202.<br>
Referring to FIGs.2 and 3, a sequence of folding operations includes folding<br>
the attaching tab 116 along fold line 120, folding the attaching tab 216 along fold line<br>
218, folding the attaching end flap 220 along fold lines 221,223, and folding the<br>
attaching end flap 226 along fold line 228. Thereby, the blank 100 reflects the<br>
configuration shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Adhesive is applied to the surface of the attaching tab 116, the attaching tab<br>
216, the attaching end flap 220, and the foldable end flap 232, as shown by the<br>
stippling in FIG. 3. The blank 100 is then folded about fold line 106 and severance<br>
lines 190/134, as shown in FIG. 4, such that certain panels of the blank 100 are in a<br>
face contacting relationship and secured to one another as shown in FIG. 6.<br>
Specifically, attaching tabs 116, 216 are secured to the gusset attaching tabs 286, 274,<br>
respectfully. The attaching tab 116 is additionally secured to the inside surface of the<br>
minor sidewall panel 142. Thereby, the sidewall panels of the blank 100 form a<br>
substantially collapsed tubular structure. Additionally, the foldable end flap 232 is<br>
secured to the bottom panel 260 to hingedly connect the bottom panels 230, 260 to one<br>
another and the attaching end (laps 220, 226 are secured to one another. The carrier<br>
800 is thereby formed in a collapsed condition. Hereinafter, sidewall panels will be<br>
referred to as sidewalls and divider wall panels will be referred to as divider walls.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 8, the erected carrier includes six divider walls 122,132,<br>
180. 184,170,174, which combine to form three two-ply handle portions 840, 850,<br>
860 that partition the receiving cells 810, 820, 830. Each handle portion 840, 850, 860<br>
includes two divider walls having overlapping cutouts and flaps. Specifically, the first<br>
handle portion 840 includes the divider wall 122 and the divider wall 170, having<br>
overlapping cutouts 126,192 and overlapping flaps 128,194, which form a first handle<br>
cutout Cl and a first handle flap Fl. The second handle portion 850 includes the<br>
divider wall 132 and the divider wall 180 having overlapping cutouts 136, 202 and<br>
12<br><br>
overlapping flaps 138.338 which form a second handle cutout C2 and a second handle<br>
flap F2. The third handle portion 860 includes the divider wall 1.74 and the divider<br>
wall 184 having overlapping cutouts 392,302 and overlapping flaps 394, 438 which<br>
form a third handle cutout C3 and a third handle flap F3.<br>
Three handle apertures 815, 825, 835 are defined in the carrier 800. Each of the<br>
three handle apertures 815,825, 835 is defined by a combination of two of the handle<br>
cutouts Cl, C2, C3 of handle portions 840, 850, 860. The first handle aperture 815<br>
includes the handle cutouts Cl, C2 of the handle portions 840,850, the second handle<br>
aperture 825 includes the handle cutouts C2, C3 of the handle portions 850, 860, and<br>
the third handle aperture 835 includes the handle cutouts C3, Cl of the first handle<br>
portions 840,860. When the carrier 800 is erected, adjacent handle portions 840, 850,<br>
860 are at an angle with respect to one another such that each handle aperture 815,<br>
825, 835 is defined in multiple planes. The handle cutouts Cl, C2, C3 of the handle<br>
portions 840, 850, 860 are interconnected, as are the handle portions 840, 850, 860, at<br>
a tubular axis 870. The handle flaps Fl, F2, F3 include curved portions C to facilitate<br>
carrying the carrier 800. Specifically, the curved portions C eliminate a cumbersome<br>
edge that would be adjacent to the tubular axis 870 for each handle aperture 815, 825,<br>
835. It is contemplated that a divider (not shown) can separate the handle cutouts Cl.<br>
C2, C3, such that each handle aperture is disposed in a single handle portion<br>
840,850,860.<br>
As best seen in FIGS. 5-7, in which the carrier 800 is in a collapsed condition<br>
or a partially erected condition, the bottom panels 230, 260 extend generally vertically<br>
within the interior of the carrier 800 In the collapsed condition, the bottom panels 230,<br>
260 extend within the space defined by the collapsed tubular structure such that the<br>
bottom panels 230, 260 are substantially parallel to, or coplanar with, the sidewalls<br>
118,142,146,150,156,160 and the gusset structures, which include the gusset panels<br>
240, 241, 270, 282 and the gusset attaching tabs 244, 245, 274, 286. The outside<br>
surface of the bottom panel 230 is in a face contacting relationship with the outside<br>
surface of the bottom panel 260, The inside surfaces of the bottom panels 230, 260 are<br>
respectively in a face contacting relationship with the inside surface of respective<br>
sidewalls 118,142,146,150,156,160 of the tubular structure. Similarly, the outside<br>
13<br><br>
surfaces of the gusset panels 240, 241 are in a face contacting relationship with the<br>
outside surfaces of the gusset panels 270, 282, respectively, which is hereinafter<br>
referred to as the first position of the gusset panels 240, 241, 270,282 The inside<br>
surface of each of the gusset panels 240, 241, 270, 282 is in a face contacting<br>
relationship with the inside surface of respective sidewalls 118,150,142,160 of the<br>
tubular structure.<br>
With the carrier 800 in a collapsed condition as described above, it may then be<br>
shipped to a bottler, retailer, or end user who erects the carrier and loads articles, such<br>
as filled bottles, into the receiving cells 810,820, 830. The carrier 800 can be erected<br>
from the collapsed condition shown in FIGs. 5-7 to the erected condition shown in<br>
FIGs. 8-10 as described below. Referring to FIG. 5, an erecting force, such as<br>
opposing forces Fe, may be applied to opposite edges of the collapsed tubular structure<br>
of the carrier 800. Applying the forces Fe induces the sidewalls 146,156 to move<br>
outward with respect to one another and induces the sidewalls 118,142 and the<br>
sidewalls 150,160 to move away from one another about the fold lines 120 and fold<br>
lines 218, 221, 228, respectively. As the sidewalls 146, 156 move outward, the gusset<br>
panels 240, 241, 270,282 rotate away from the sidewalls 118,150,142, 160 to which<br>
the gusset attaching tabs 244, 245, 274, 286 are attached, along respective fold lines<br>
248, 257, 278, 290. Substantially simultaneously, the bottom panels 230, 260 rotate<br>
away from one another along the fold line 234 and away from the sidewalls 146,156<br>
along the fold lines 110,114, respectively. In fact, it is contemplated that the rotation<br>
of the gusset panels 240, 241, 270, 282 causes, encourages, or induces the rotation of<br>
the bottom panels 230, 260.<br>
The bottom panels 230. 260 continue to rotate away from one another and the<br>
sidewalls 118,142,150,160 continue to rotate away from one another such that the<br>
gusset panels 240, 241, 270, 282 incur a certain level of compressive stress causing<br>
them to become unstable, thereby inducing the bottom panels, gusset panels, and<br>
sidewalls to toggle or spring into an erected position. During the toggle action, the<br>
gusset panels 240, 241,270, 282 rotate relative to the bottom panels 230,260 about<br>
fold lines 242, 243,272,284, respectively, and relative to the sidewalls, 118,150,142,<br>
160 about fold lines 248,257,278,290, respectively. At the end of the toggle action,<br>
the gusset panels 240, 241, 270, 282 are disposed in a second position where the<br>
14<br><br>
outside surface of each of the gusset panels 240,241,270, 282 approaches and<br>
generally assumes a face contacting arrangement with the inside surface of a respective<br>
sidewall 118,150,142,160 of the tubular structure. Further, the gusset panels 240,<br>
241, 270, 282 are substantially perpendicular to the bottom panels 230, 260, which are<br>
substantially coplanar to one another.<br>
The carrier may be collapsed by reversing this process, such as by providing<br>
opposing forces Fc to opposing sidewalls 146 and 156 of the tubular structure, as<br>
shown in FIG. 10. The forces Fc cause the gusset panels to fold toward inward and<br>
upward about the fold lines 248, 257, 272, 284 and the bottom panels 230, 260 to fold<br>
upward and inward.<br>
As best shown in FIG. 9, when the carrier 800 is in an erected condition, the<br>
bottom panels 230, 260 are substantially coplanar with one another to form a bottom<br>
wall that is generally perpendicular to each of the sidewalls of the tubular structure.<br>
The bottom panels 230, 260 may bow upward near the hinged connection along fold<br>
line 234. Referring to FIG. 17, the overlapping portions of bottom panel 260 and of<br>
the end flap 232 of bottom panel 230 extend out of the plane of any fiat surface upon<br>
which the carrier 800 rests, to provide a buffer for articles disposed on the inside<br>
surface of the bottom wall in receiving cells 810, 820, 830. When a bottle is received<br>
atop the bottom panels 230, 260. the end flap 232 and bottom panel 260 move<br>
downward against the bias of the fold line 234 so that the bottom panels 230, 260<br>
begin to flatten from their upwardly bowed position to a generally horizontal position<br>
and the end flap 232 or buffer is at least temporarily compressed against bottom panel<br>
230. During this compressing of the bottom panels 230, 260, gusset panels 240, 241,<br>
270, 282 move outwardly toward their respective sidewalls 118,150, 142,160, as<br>
represented by the arrows A in FIG. 9, to provide further cushioning at the bottom<br>
wall.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 11-16.<br>
Elements which are substantially similar in the first and second embodiment have been<br>
designated by the same reference numerals with the addition of the suffix "A" for<br>
elements in the second embodiment. Only primary and pertinent differences between<br>
the embodiments are discussed below.<br>
15<br><br>
In the second embodiment, the gusset structures include second gusset panels<br>
1244,1245,1274,1286 in lieu of the attaching tabs 244, 245,274,286. The second<br>
gusset panels 1244,1245,1274,1286 are hingedly connected to the sidewall panels<br>
118A, 150A, 142A, 160A along fold lines 250A, 251 A, 280bA, 292A and to the first<br>
gusset panels 240A, 241A, 270A, 282A along fold lines 248A, 257A, 278A, 290A.<br>
Bottom panels 230A, 260A are hingedly connected to sidewall panels 146A, 156A<br>
along curved fold lines 110A, 114A, respectively. In this embodiment, the fold lines<br>
110A, 114A are curved to facilitate the rotation of bottom panels 230A, 260A to form<br>
a bottom wall when the carrier 800A is erected and to encourage the bottom wall to<br>
bow inwardly with respect to the tubular structure such that the bottom wail is<br>
generally concave, as shown in FIG. 18. Further, a first score line 1220 is provided<br>
across bottom panel 230A and end flap 232A, and a second score line 1210 is provided<br>
across bottom panel 260A, such that score lines 1210,1220 are generally aligned upon<br>
assembly of the carrier 800A and assist the upward arching of the bottom panels 230A,<br>
260A. In assembly, the top surface of end flap 232A is attached to the bottom surface<br>
of bottom panel 260A.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, in the collapsed condition, bottom panels 230A,<br>
260A extend outwardly from the interior of the tubular structure of the carrier and are<br>
attached to each other by end flap 232A such that they are hingedly connected along a<br>
fold line 234A. When assembled and collapsed, bottom panels 230A, 260A, first<br>
gusset panels 240A, 241 A, 270A, 282A, and second gusset panels 1244, 1245. 1274,<br>
1286, and the sidewall panels 118A, 146A, 150A, 142A, 156A, 160A are generally in<br>
the same plane. The bottom panels 230A, 260A move away from one another but<br>
toward the inside surface of the tubular structure when the carrier 800A is erected to an<br>
erected condition.<br>
The conversion of the carrier from the collapsed condition shown in FIGs. 12<br>
and 13, to the erected condition shown in FIGS. 14-16. will now be described. An<br>
erecting force, such as opposing forces Fe shown in FIG. 13, may be applied to<br>
opposite edges of a collapsed carrier 800A. During the initial erecting movement, the<br>
sidewalls 146A, 156A begin to move away from one another to define an open end of<br>
the tubular structure and the bottom panels 230A, 260A rotate away from one another<br>
along, fold line 234A and toward the open end of the tubular structure along fold lines<br>
16<br><br>
110A, 114A. The second gusset panels 1244,1245,1274,1286 rotate toward the<br>
interior of the tubular structure about fold tines 250A, 251 A, 280A, 292A,<br>
respectively. The first and second gusset panels rotate toward one another about their<br>
respective fold lines 248A, 257A, 278A, 290A. The first gusset panels 240A, 241 A,<br>
270A, 282A rotate relative to the bottom panels 230A, 260A along fold lines 249A,<br>
243A, 277A, 281 A. As the erecting movement continues, gusset panels cause the<br>
bottom panels 230A, 260A and sidewalls 118A 150A, 160A, 142A to toggle or spring<br>
into an erected position and maintains the carrier 800A in an erected condition. The<br>
curved fold lines 110A, 114A, the score lines 1210,1220, and fold line 234A assist the<br>
bottom panels 230A, 260A in arching upward into the interior of the carrier to<br>
maintain the erected condition of the carrier.<br>
With reference now to FIG. 15, in the erected condition, the outside surface of<br>
the first gusset panels 240A, 241 A, 270A, 282A are in a face contacting relationship<br>
with the outside surface of the second gusset panels 1244,1245, 1274,1286. The<br>
inside surface of second gusset panels 1244, 1245, 1274, 1286 approaches a face<br>
contacting relationship with the inside surface of the sidewalls 118A, 150A, 142A.<br>
160A of the tubular structure.<br>
In another embodiment, interior partitions (not shown) may be provided. One<br>
purpose for such partitions is to protect an article within a receiving cell from contact<br>
with an adjacent article in an adjacent receiving cell. Providing such protection,<br>
whether with full height or less than full height walls, reduces the likelihood of damage<br>
during loading and transportation.<br>
There are a number of ways to provide interior partitions, whether from a<br>
single blank or by adding inserts to a finished carrier made according to the principles<br>
taught herein. By way of illustration and not limitation, an embodiment that includes<br>
full height interior partition may be constructed from a blank similar to the blank 122A<br>
described above.<br>
Turning briefly to FIG, 11, interior partitions may be provided by extending<br>
the width of any of the panels 116A, 220A, 226A, or 260A. As understood by those<br>
skilled in the art, any of these panels may be extended and configured, with the<br>
17<br><br>
addition of various fold lines, to extend inward or upward into the interior of the<br>
carrier. In an efficient embodiment the interior walls will follow the configuration of<br>
the handle portions 840, 850,860, best shown in FIG 8. For example, the opposite<br>
lower halves of panels 220A and 226A may be extended considerably and each<br>
provided with a single longitudinal fold line. With the addition of these elements,<br>
panels 220A and 226A may jointly extend into the interior of the carrier 800A, similar<br>
to the present 200A as shown in FIG 15. The joint interior panels 220A/226A could be<br>
located immediately below divider wall 174A and then diverge, with panel 220A<br>
extending partially or fully below one divider wall and panel 226A extending partially<br>
or fully below the other divider wall.<br>
It should be appreciated that as used herein, directional references such as<br>
"top", "base", "end", "side", "upper" and "lower" do not limit the respective panels to<br>
such orientation, but merely serve to distinguish these panels from one another. The<br>
orientation of the carrier could be altered depending upon, for example, the articles to<br>
be carried in the carrier.<br>
It should be still further appreciated that any reference to a fold line or hinged<br>
connection should not be construed as necessarily referring to a single fold line only:<br>
indeed it is envisaged that hinged connection can be formed from one or more of the<br>
following: a score line, a frangible line, or a fold line, without departing from the scope<br>
of the invention. Any reference to a severance line should be construed as a line that<br>
has been precut, or that is severable by means of a frangible connection.<br>
The law does not require and it is economically prohibitive to illustrate and<br>
describe every embodiment of the present invention. Thus, those skilled in the art will<br>
also appreciate that the embodiments described represent only examples of the various<br>
carrier types and configurations that will be suitable for implementation of the various<br>
embodiments of the invention. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is<br>
described by the claims appended hereto and supported by the foregoing.<br>

aperture interrupts said fold line.<br>
21<br>
16.	The carrier of claim 14, wherein each of said first and second hand<br>
receiving apertures include hand flaps, said hand flaps defining a handle flap for said<br>
handle aperture, said hand flaps including curved portions which define a cutout in<br>
said handle flap adjacent to said fold line.<br><br>
A carrier (800) that is reversibly erectable from a collapsed condition to an erected<br>
condition and that reliably maintains its erected condition. The carrier includes a tubular<br>
portion defined by side walls (118, 146, 150, 142, 156, 160) and a bottom wall defined by<br>
bottom panels (230, 260). The bottom panels are hingedly connected to an edge of the<br>
tubular structure. Gusset structures connect the bottom panels to the tubular structure and<br>
cause the bottom panels to toggle as the carrier is erected. The gusset structures<br>
additionally retain the bottom wall in the erected condition. In the erected condition, the<br>
bottom wall of the carrier includes a buffer for limiting or preventing damage to articles as<br>
they are loaded into the carrier. The handle of the carrier is ergonomically defined in<br>
multiple planes and includes handle flaps including curved portions that improve the<br>
comfort of a handle.<br></td>
