				<td>Process for preparing triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC)<br>
Description<br>
The invention is directed to an improved, reliably<br>
performable process for preparing triallyl isocyanurate<br>
(TAIC) by Cu2+-catalysed rearrangement of triallyl<br>
cyanurate (TAC) at at least 90°C.<br>
Triallyl isocyanuiate [triallyl-s-triazine-<br>
2, 4, 6(1H,3H,5H)-trione; referred to as TAIC in<br>
abbreviated form] is a trifunctional polymerizable<br>
monomer which finds use as a crosslinking component for<br>
high-value thermoplastics and synthetic rubber, and<br>
also as a raw material for the production of flame<br>
retardants. Moreover, TAIC also finds use as a copoly-<br>
merization component in the polymerization of vinylic,<br>
allylic and acrylic mononers.<br>
TAIC can be prepared essentially by three methods:<br>
In the process accord..ng to US patent 3,322,761,<br>
triallyl isocyanurate (T'AIC) is obtained by reacting<br>
cyanuric acid with allyl chloride and sodium hydroxide<br>
in the presence of copper chloride as a catalyst. A<br>
disadvantage in this piocess is the high excess of<br>
allyl chloride (6 mol,mol o:: cyanuric acid), the<br>
formation of allyl alcohol, and diallyl isocyanurate as<br>
hydrolysis products, anc the complicated removal and<br>
purification of the TAIC obtained.<br>
An industrially more useiul route to the preparation of<br>
TAIC is the trimerizatior of allyl isocyanate formed in<br>
situ. In this case, as c escribed by way of example in<br>
JP 52-109627 or DE-A 28 S 084, an alkali metal cyanate<br>
is reacted with allyl chloride in a dipolar aprotic<br>
solvent, preferably dimehylfornamide, at temperatures<br>
around 130°C. Although the process affords good yields,<br>
a disadvantage is the occurrence of large amounts of<br><br>
organically contaminated sodium chloride, the use of<br>
toxic solvents and tha quite expensive purification<br>
steps which are neede 1 in crder to provide a TAIC<br>
quality which satisfies market requirements.<br>
A third method for the preparation of TAIC is the<br>
Claisen rearrangement of tr:.allyl cyanurate (TAC) ,<br>
which is itself obtained on the industrial scale by<br>
reaction of cyanuric chloride with allyl alcohol, in<br>
the presence of catalysts (cat.).<br><br>
In the process accorcing to EP 0 078 567 Al, the<br>
rearrangement of TAC to TAIC is performed in the<br>
presence of quaternary ammorium compounds. Disad-<br>
vantages in this proces.s are the long reaction times<br>
and the risk of spontaneous polymerization of the<br>
entire mixture. In the rsworking of the process by the<br>
inventors of the presert application, polymerization<br>
with temperatures of &gt; 200 °C and vigorous evolution of<br>
smoke occurred after a few minutes.<br>
The isomerization of cyarurates to isocyanurates in the<br>
presence of metallic copper is described by Balitskaya<br>
et al. in Ukr. Khim. Zt . 40(8), 881, (1974). In the<br>
presence of 20% copper, the rearrangement of TAC to<br>
TAIC at 70°C is said to have ended within 5 h. Attempts<br>
of the inventors of the present application and also of<br>
EP 0 078 567 Al, in contrast, did not lead to any such<br>
result.<br><br>
SU patent 1121259 teaches a process for preparing TAIC<br>
by isomerizing TAC in toluene in the presence of copper<br>
and a reducing agent from the group of tin (II) chloride<br>
and iron (II) chloride it temperatures of 95 to 130°C.<br>
The molar ratios of th= components here are: TAC (1);<br>
toluene (1.3-4.1); copper (0.39-0.8); reducing agent<br>
(0.0013-0.0026). Depending on the temperature and the<br>
catalyst concentration, the reaction times are 1 to<br>
20 h. Disadvantages hero are the very high catalyst use<br>
and the long reaction t.mes.<br>
SU patent 1121260 claims the isomerization of TAC to<br>
TAIC in toluene as a solvent using a Cu salt, such as<br>
CuCl2 • 2H20 • CuAc2 • 2HzO, CJCI, CuS04 • 5H20, CuF2 •<br>
2H20, Cu(N03)2 • 3H20 anc CuBr, as a catalyst. The molar<br>
TAC:toluene:catalyst ratios are specified as 1:(1.3-<br>
4) : (0.0015-0.0073) . The processes of SU 1121259 and<br>
SU 1121260 are perforned batchwise, catalyst being<br>
initially charged in a glass reactor and being admixed<br>
with a portion of a solution of TAC in toluene. After<br>
heating to about 100°C, the remaining amount of the<br>
TAC/toluene mixture is added within 3 h and the<br>
reaction is continued for 2 h; thereafter, the reaction<br>
mixture is worked up by distillation.<br>
In the reworking of the process of SU 1121260, it has<br>
been found that the orocedure described cannot be<br>
operated reliably and safely for a preparation of the<br>
triallyl isocyanurate on the industrial scale. Even<br>
though the SU document teaches the use of a minimum<br>
amount of toluene in order to prevent an explosion-like<br>
process, uncontrollable process states occurred in the<br>
reworking of the process. This document does not give<br>
any information as to how the process can be operated<br>
on the industrial scale and continuously without any<br>
safety risk.<br>
A further disadvantage of the process described in<br><br>
SU 1121260 is the formation of polymerization products:<br>
since the TAIC remains in the reactor over a long<br>
period, it is possible, as the inventors of the present<br>
application have found for up to 20% by weight of<br>
oligomers to form, which are not detectable in the gas<br>
chromatogram but give rise to a precipitate with<br>
methanol after the solvent has been distilled off. It<br>
has also been found ;hat the use of the hydrate-<br>
containing Cu salts taught in the SU document leads<br>
either to an unsatis.factory conversion or to the<br>
formation of a by-product. As experiments by the<br>
Applicant have found, water eliminates allyl alcohol<br>
from TAC under the catalytic action of the copper<br>
salts, so that diallyl isocyanurate is formed as a by-<br>
product.<br>
It is accordingly an object of the invention to<br>
indicate the provision of an improved and reliably<br>
performable process foe preparing TAIC by Cu salt-<br>
catalysed rearrangement of TAC. The process should be<br>
simple to perform. In a further object, embodiments by<br>
which the use of solver t can be minimized should also<br>
be indicated. In a further object, TAIC should be<br>
obtainable in high yiel i and high purity. In a further<br>
object, the process should largely avoid the formation<br>
of oligomeric and polymeric by-products.<br>
The aforementioned objects and further objects as are<br>
evident from the description are achieved by the<br>
process according to the invention according to the<br>
main claim and in particular embodiments according to<br>
the subclaims. The process according to the invention<br>
is a continuous process which overcomes the problems of<br>
the batch process.<br>
A process has been found for preparing triallyl<br>
isocyanurate (TAIC), comprising rearrangement of<br>
triallyl cyanurate (TACi in the presence of a Cu salt<br><br>
at a temperature of at least 90°C, which is charac-<br>
terized in that TAC end a Cu2+ salt are introduced<br>
continuously in an amount of 0.01 to 1% by weight of<br>
Cu2+, based on TAC, separately from one another or in<br>
the form of a mixture Comprising these components, into<br>
a TAIC-containing reaction mixture which has been<br>
formed at at least 90°C by rearrangement of TAC in the<br>
presence of a Cu2+ salt and has not been cooled below<br>
90°C thereafter, the rearrangement is performed under<br>
these conditions while maintaining a temperature in the<br>
range of 90 to 160°C ard an amount of reaction mixture<br>
corresponding to the addition is discharged<br>
continuously and TAIC is isolated therefrom.<br>
The isomerization of TAC to TAIC under Cu salt<br>
catalysis is, as has beun found, very probably an auto-<br>
catalytic process with an incubation time which depends<br>
upon the type of catalyst used, upon the catalyst<br>
concentration, upon the temperature and upon the<br>
solvent used.<br>
The isomerization proceeds with release of<br>
700 kJoule/kg of TAC. Measurements in a Contraves<br>
calorimeter additionally showed that more than 90% of<br>
the total exothermicity is released within approx.<br>
5 min. This behaviour led to the indicated problems of<br>
the process known to da:e. These problems are solved by<br>
the process according tc the invention.<br>
In the process according to the invention, the start<br>
phase and hence the composition of the start mixture of<br>
the reaction are highly significant with regard to safe<br>
performance of the overall reaction. It is important<br>
that the start mixture originated from the Cu2+-<br>
catalysed isomerization of TAC to TAIC and had not been<br>
cooled to a temperature below 90°C before use. Cooling<br>
of the start mixture comprising TAIC and Cu2+ to values<br>
below 90°C deactivates the catalyst or catalyst<br><br>
complex; simple heatinc of the mixture does not result<br>
in reactivation; instead, another incubation time has<br>
to be passed through after adding TAC. Use of an<br>
inventive reaction mixture into which TAC is introduced<br>
continuously prevents spontaneous reactions which may<br>
occur before the incubation time has ended and may be<br>
uncontrollable.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the isomerization is<br>
performed in the riesence of a polymerization<br>
inhibitor; examples are hydroquinone, hydroquinone<br>
monomethyl ether, tert-butylated phenols and alkyl-<br>
phenols. Such inhibitors are often already present in<br>
the TAC.<br>
The dependence of the incubation time upon the catalyst<br>
concentration in toluene as the solvent follows from<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
The measurements were effected in 100 ml flasks which<br>
were present in a silicone bath at 120 ± 2°C. The<br>
commencement of the isomerization is recognizable by a<br>
sudden temperature rise which leads to vigorous boiling<br>
of the entire flask contents. Gas chromatography<br>
analyses show consistently that virtually no reaction<br>
has taken place beforehand. The TAC:toluene volume<br>
ratio was 1:2; the catalyst used was CuCl2 • 2H2O; the<br><br>
amount in % is based on TAC.<br>
Apart from aromatic hydrocarbons, there are, as has<br>
been found, further solvent croups in which the iso-<br>
merization can be performed. Apart from toluene,<br>
suitable solvents are a orotic solvents which are stable<br>
with respect to a combination of Cu2+ and TAC, such as<br>
aliphatic, cycloalipha ,ic or aromatic hydrocarbons,<br>
diesters of carbonic acid, aromatic and aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acid esters and ethers. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, TAIC itself serves as a solvent and means<br>
of evaporative cooling. Table 2 shows some solvents and<br>
the incubation times del ermined with them.<br><br>
The selection of the so .vents is, when operation is not<br>
to be effected under pressure, determined by the<br>
boiling temperature, which should preferably be in the<br>
range of 110 to 160°C. A reaction temperature of 110 to<br>
140°C has been found to be favourable. Higher-boiling<br>
solvents such as TAIC can be transferred into the<br>
favourable working range by applying a vacuum.<br>
Alcohols, ketones, acid anhydrides and many dipolar<br><br>
aprotic solvents are less suitable or completely<br>
unsuitable since they form by-products.<br>
All of the problems which afflict the isomerization of<br>
TAC are circumvented by the continuous process<br>
according to the invention, since operation is effected<br>
here with small operating volumes and very short<br>
residence times. This irinimizes the risk potential of a<br>
spontaneous polymerization and prevents polymerization<br>
as a result of long thermal stress.<br>
The basis of the prccess is the discovery that a<br>
reaction, once it has set in :.n a Cu2+-containing start<br>
reaction mixture, can be maintained by supplying TAC or<br>
a mixture of TAC and solvent in which catalyst may<br>
additionally be dissolved or be dispersed ultrafine,<br>
when an amount equivalent to the amount supplied can<br>
simultaneously be withdrawn from the reaction vessel,<br>
specifically in the form of distilled-off TAIC or in<br>
the form of a solution of TAIC and Cu2+ catalyst in the<br>
particular solvent.<br>
Copper(II) chloride exhibits the surprising property of<br>
dissolving readily in nixtures of toluene and TAC with<br>
a blue colour but onl^ poorly in the pure starting<br>
components. This system is therefore particularly<br>
preferred, also owing to th= ready availability of<br>
CUCI2. Sparingly solubl 3 Cu2+ catalysts can be used for<br>
the continuous process only when they have been ground<br>
to microfine particles by suitable dispersion units<br>
before or during the reaction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Cu2+ catalyst used is an<br>
anhydrous salt, especially a salt from the group of<br>
CuCl2, CuBr2, CUI2, Cu(HCOO)2 where R = alkyl or aryl.<br>
Typically, the rearrangement is performed in the<br>
presence of 0.01 to 1% by weicht of Cu2+, in particular<br>
0.02 to 0.2% by weight of Cu2+, based on the TAIC<br><br>
present in the start reaction mixture converted - TAC<br>
has been converted virtually quantitatively a few<br>
minutes after its addition. When catalyst-containing<br>
reaction mixture is drawn off to the degree in which<br>
TAC and solvent are supplied, the catalyst concen-<br>
tration also has to be Maintained by supplying<br>
catalyst.<br>
In a preferred embodimeit, the reaction is performed in<br>
the absence of an extraneous solvent, i.e. TAIC is the<br>
reaction medium. In this case, TAC is introduced<br>
continuously into a TAIC-containing start reaction<br>
mixture which has beei formed at at least 90 °C by<br>
rearrangement of TAC in the presence of a Cu2+ salt and<br>
has not been cooled below 90°C thereafter, the<br>
rearrangement is performed at 90 to 160°C, in<br>
particular 110 to 14(i°C, and TAIC which forms is<br>
distilled continuously out of the reaction mixture<br>
under reduced pressure, the addition rate of TAC (g of<br>
TAC/min) corresponding essentially to the distillation<br>
rate of TAIC (g of TAIC/min). Advantages of this<br>
embodiment are dispensing with an extraneous solvent,<br>
the use of catalyst only once and the simple workup.<br>
In a preferred embodimeit, the process according to the<br>
invention can be impleoented by the following process<br>
steps:<br>
Start reaction: A mixture of TAC, solvent and catalyst<br>
is introduced into a reaction vessel. The<br>
TAC:solvent:Cu2+ ratio, in order to reliably capture the<br>
exothermicity and allow a relatively rapid start, is<br>
selected at about 250 M! of TAC: 750 ml of solvent: 3 g<br>
of CuCl2 per litre of solution. The reactor is heated<br>
to internal temperature 110 to 115°C and stirred. After<br>
approx. 15 to 17 min, the rearrangement to TAIC sets<br>
in, which is recognized by vigorous boiling of the<br>
reactor contents.<br><br>
Continuous method: Once the reaction has set in, a<br>
mixture of TAC, sol/ent and catalyst is pumped<br>
continuously into the ] eactor, specifically in such an<br>
amount that the mean residence time of the TAC is not<br>
less than approx. 10 md r. and not more than 60 min. The<br>
amount of solvent in the solution supplied is variable<br>
within wide limits, tut the content of solvent is<br>
preferably reduced in order to reduce distillation<br>
work.<br>
It is in principle also possible to work without<br>
solvent; in this case, the TAIC which forms serves as<br>
the reaction medium, a;id the heat of isomerization is<br>
removed here by evaporative cooling under reduced<br>
pressure. The ratio of the reactants can vary in the<br>
TAC: solvent volume ratio of about 1:4 to 1:0. The<br>
catalyst concentration can, once the reaction has set<br>
in (start reaction), b= lowered very greatly. Concen-<br>
trations of 0.15 g cf Cu2+ per litre of reactant<br>
solution are still effective.<br>
Isolation of the TA.IC: The same amount of<br>
TAIC/solvent/catalyst as synchronously pumped out of<br>
the reactor as that in which reactants are added. When<br>
CUCI2 and toluene or ciethyl carbonate are used, the<br>
incoming TAC solution has a bLue colour, the withdrawn<br>
TAIC solution a green colour. The reaction is monitored<br>
by gas chromatography. Once the solvent has been<br>
distilled off, the TAIC is purified by vacuum<br>
distillation. The bottom effluent contains the Cu2+. In<br>
a particular embodiment of the process, disposal of the<br>
Cu2+ can be largely dispensed with: in this case, the<br>
bottoms of the vacuum distillation, whose proportion is<br>
set somewhat higher, are puuped directly and while<br>
still hot to the reaction vessel, and ensure the<br>
maintenance of the catalyst concentration here.<br>
However, the activity is preserved only when the<br><br>
temperature of the bottom is kept at at least 90 °C;<br>
after cooling of the bottom to room temperature and<br>
reheating, the reaction can no longer be maintained.<br>
The process according to the invention can be performed<br>
reliably and without r..sk of a spontaneous reaction. A<br>
rapid reaction and continuous method largely avoid the<br>
formation of by-products and oligomers.<br>
The examples which follow are intended to illustrate<br>
the process in detail:<br>
Example 1<br>
A solution of 25 ml of TAC, 0.3 g of CuCl2 (anhydrous)<br>
in 75 ml of toluene was introduced into a jacketed<br>
stirred vessel of capacity 500 ml, which was heated by<br>
a thermostatted silicoie bath adjusted to 130°C. The<br>
internal flask temperature was adjusted to 113 to<br>
115°C. After 16 min, vigorous reflux set in; the<br>
initially blue solution had been converted to a dark<br>
olive green solution. After the reaction had abated,<br>
10 ml/min of a mixture of 3000 ml of TAC, 3.0 g of<br>
CuCl2 and 3000 ml of toluene were pumped in<br>
continuously by means of a metering pump. At the same<br>
time, 10 ml/min of the reaction solution were withdrawn<br>
by means of a 2nd metering pump. The reaction<br>
temperature rose to approx. 123 to 125°C.<br>
When the system is operated with higher TAC<br>
concentration (higher space-time yield), the reaction<br>
temperature is limited to max. 140°C by applying an<br>
appropriate vacuum.<br>
The conversion rate was &gt; 99.9%. The by-product formed<br>
by residual water in TAC ard toluene was a little<br>
diallyl isocyanurate. The process was operated without<br>
any problem over a period of 10 h.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Process according to Example 1, except that diethyl<br>
carbonate was used as the solvent. The reaction mixture<br>
for the start reaction was prepared by mixing TAC with<br>
diethyl carbonate in a volume ratio of 1 to 3 and<br>
adding 2.5 g of CuCl2 per litre of reactant solution,<br>
and then ultrafine grinding in a wet mill. After<br>
initially charging 200 nL of this solution, heating to<br>
130°C and waiting for the stait reaction, 15 ml/min of<br>
a homogeneous dispersion of TAC and diethyl carbonate<br>
in a volume ratio of L to 1 and 0.4 g of CUCI2 per<br>
litre of solution were pumped in and, in parallel,<br>
15 ml/min of green THIC solution were withdrawn. The<br>
conversion of the TAC was &gt; 99.8%. This procedure was<br>
maintained over a pericd of 8 h without disruption or<br>
decline in the yield anc purity.<br>
Example 3<br>
Process according to Example 1, except that, after the<br>
onset of the start reaction, a. homogeneous, ultrafine-<br>
dispersed mixture of LO00 ml of TAC and 0.25 g of<br>
anhydrous CUCI2 was metered in. The amount metered in<br>
was 10 ml/min; at the same time, 10 ml/min of reaction<br>
solution were pumped oul . Since the reaction vessel had<br>
become low in toluene in the course of time as a result<br>
of distilling-off toluene, the operating temperature in<br>
the reactor rose continually. In order to prevent poly-<br>
merization, a vacuum was applied at internal flask<br>
temperature 140°C in order to maintain a constant<br>
working temperature thr 3ugh evaporative cooling of the<br>
TAIC formed. The vacuum necessary for this purpose was<br>
2.0 to 3.0 hPa. This process afforded TAIC with a<br>
purity of 98.5%; the isomerization rate of the TAIC was<br>
&gt; 99.8%.<br><br>

APPLICANTS' AGENT<br><br>
The invention is directed to an improved, reliably performable process for preparing triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC) by Cu2+-catalysed rearrangement of triallyl cyanurate (TAC) at at least 90° C. According to the invention, TAC and, if required, also a Cu2+ catalyst and solvent are fed continuously to a start reaction<br>
mixture after onset of the in tially inhibited isomerization reaction, the isomerization is performed at from 90 to 160° C and an amount of reaction mixture equivalent to the amount of reactant is drawn off continuously and sent<br>
to the workup. Preference is giver to effecting the isomerization in TAIC as the reaction medium.</td>
