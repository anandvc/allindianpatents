				<td>The invention relates to fast disintegrating tablet ccxnprising<br>
coated active principle and a mixture of excipients, particularly<br>
where the tablet disintegrate in the mouth in less than 40 seconds<br>
and the active principle have intrinsic characteristics.<br>
Ibuprofen, paracetamol and aspirin may be mentioned as examples of active<br>
principles which can be used 10 produce the tablets according to the invention.<br>
Tablets based on ibuprofen are already known<br>
Thus patent US 5.215.755 describes chewing tablets in which the ibuprofen<br>
is present in the form of granules having a coating based on hydroxyethyl cellulose<br>
or a hydroxyethyl cellulose/hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose mixture. This coating<br>
was chosen to overcome the observed deficiencies of the coatings of the prior art<br>
based on ethyl cellulose only<br>
The object of the invention is to provide tablets obtained with the aid of<br>
particles of coated active principle which not only disintegrate rapidly in the mouth<br>
in less than 40 seconds, but also have a pleasant palatability, together with<br>
satisfactory hardness characteristics enabling them to be manufactured industrially,<br>
and which keep sufficiently well under normal storage conditions to enable them to<br>
be handled by the patient, these tablets also optimizing the bioavailability of the<br>
active principle.<br>
The tablet according to the invention is characterized in that it is based on<br>
particles of coated active principle which have intrinsic compression characteristics,<br>
and on a mixture of excipients, the ratio of excipient mixture to coated active<br>
principle being 0 4 to 6 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 4 parts by weight, the<br>
mixture of excipients comprising<br>
- a disintegration agent.<br>
- a soluble diluent agent with binding properties which consists of a polyol<br>
having less than 13 carbon atoms and being either in the form of the directly<br>
compressible product with an average panicle diameter of 100 to 500 mm, or in the<br>
form of a powder with an average panicle diameter of less than 100 mm, this polyol<br>
preferably being selected from the group comprising mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and<br>
maltitol, it being understood that sorbitol cannot be used alone and that, in the case<br>
where there is only one soluble diluent agent with binding properties, it is used in<br>
the form of the directly compressible product, whereas in the case where there are<br>
at least two soluble diluent agents with binding properties, one is present in the<br>
directly compressible form and the other is present in powder form, it then being<br>
possible for the polyols to be the same, the ratio of directly compressible polyol to<br>
powder polyol being 99/1 to 20/80, preferably 80/20 to 20/80;<br>
- a lubricant;<br>
- a permeabilizing agent; and<br>
- advantageously sweeteners, flavourings and colours,<br>
the proportion of disintegrating agent being 1 to 15% by weight, preferably 2 to 7%<br>
by weight, and the proportion of soluble agent being 30 to 90% by weight,<br>
preferably 40 to 70% by weight, based in each case on the weight of the tablet.<br>
The soluble diluent agent with binding properties consists of a polyol having<br>
less than 13 carbon atoms and being either in the form of the directly compressible<br>
product with an average particle diameter of between 100 and 500 micrometres, or<br>
in the form of a powder with an average particle diameter of less than 100<br>
micrometres, this polyol preferably being selected from the group comprising<br>
mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol and maltitol, it being impossible to use sorbitol alone.<br>
If there is a single soluble diluent agent with binding properties, therefore<br>
different from sorbitol, it is used in the form of the directly compressible product.<br>
If at least two soluble diluent agents with binding properties are used, one is<br>
present in the form of the directly compressible product and the other, which can<br>
consist of the same polyol, is present in the form of a powder in which the average<br>
diameter of the constituent particles is less than 100 micrometres, the ratio of<br>
directly compressible polyol to powder polyol being 99/1 to 20/80, preferably 80/20<br>
to 20/80.<br>
The disintegration agent is selected from the group comprising especially<br>
crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (known in the profession as<br>
croscarmellose), crospovidone and mixtures thereof. By virtue of the choice and<br>
proportion of this disintegration agent, the tablet retains an acceptable hardness for<br>
normal handling conditions when tablets are kept in leaktight packaging up to<br>
temperatures of at least 30°C.<br>
The chosen proportions of disintegration agent and soluble agent for<br>
constituting the excipient are 1 to 15% by weight and 30 to 90% by weight,<br>
respectively, based in each case on the weight of the tablet.<br>
The lubricant preferably used in this mixture of excipients is selected from<br>
the group comprising magnesium stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, stearic acid,<br>
micronized polyoxyethylene glycol (micronized Macrogol 6000) and mixtures<br>
thereof. It can be used in a proportion of 0.05 to 2%, based on the total weight of<br>
the tablet.<br>
The permeabilizing agent used is a compound selected from the group<br>
comprising especially silicas with a high affinity for aqueous solvents, such as the<br>
precipitated silica better known by the trade mark Syloid®, maltodextrins, b-<br>
cyclodextrins and mixtures thereof.<br>
The permeabilizing agent allows the creation of a hydrophilic network which<br>
facilitates the penetration of the saliva and hence assists the disintegration of the<br>
tablet.<br>
In one highly advantageous embodiment of the tablets according to the<br>
invention, the permeabilizing agent is the precipitated silica better known by the<br>
trade mark Syloid® FP244. In fact, this silica not only assists the disintegration of<br>
the tablets, but also, through its properties as a flow promoter, favours the<br>
rearrangements of the particles during compression, and it makes it possible on the<br>
one hand to reduce the amount of hydrophobic lubricant needed to ensure optimum<br>
manufacturing conditions, and on the other hand to reduce the intensity of the<br>
compression force needed to produce a tablet which can be handled under these<br>
industrial conditions.<br>
The proportion of permeabilizing agent is between 0.5 and 5% by weight,<br>
based on the weight of the tablet.<br>
A sweetener and optionally a flavouring and a colour are also included in the<br>
mixture of excipients forming part of the composition of the tablets according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The sweetener can be selected from the group comprising especially<br>
aspartame, potassium acesulfame, sodium saccharinate, neohesperidin dihydro-<br>
chalcone and mixtures thereof.<br>
The flavourings and colours are those conventionally used in pharmacy for<br>
the preparation of tablets.<br>
Compared with the already existing tablets of the type in question, the<br>
tablets according to the invention have an improved palatability and particularly an<br>
improved taste and texture, and can allow a reduction in the ratio of tablet weight<br>
to active principle dose.<br>
They have a satisfactory hardness, enabling them to be handled under<br>
standard operating conditions without special operating precautions. By way of<br>
indication, it is pointed out that hardnesses which satisfy these conditions are<br>
generally between 20 and 70 Newtons.<br>
The tablets according to the invention can be prepared in the following<br>
manner or by any other appropriate process. Particles of coated active principle<br>
which have intrinsic compression characteristics are added to a mixture of<br>
excipients containing a disintegration agent, a soluble diluent agent with binding<br>
properties, a permeabilizing agent and advantageously a lubricant, sweeteners,<br>
flavourings and colours, in the proportions indicated above. The mixture obtained<br>
in this way is homogenized in a dry mixer and then subjected to a compression force<br>
which gives the resulting tablet a satisfactory hardness, enabling it to be<br>
manufactured industrially and handled under normal conditions without special<br>
operating precautions; by way of indication, it is pointed out that hardnesses which<br>
satisfy these conditions are generally between 20 and 70 Newtons.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Tablet containing 200 mg of ibuprofen<br>
Table I shows the unit formula and the centesimal formula of this tablet.<br>
This tablet is prepared as indicated below.<br>
The excipients identified in Table I are sieved on a grid with a mesh size of<br>
1000 mm.<br>
The different constituents are weighed in separate containers of appropriate<br>
capacity.<br>
The coated ibuprofen particles (having the formulation given in Table II<br>
below), the granulated mannitol, the pulverulent mannitol, the croscarmellose, the<br>
aspartame, the potassium acesulfame, the precipitated silica and the flavourings are<br>
introduced into a rotating mixer.<br>
A homogeneous mixture is prepared.<br>
The mixer is stopped, the magnesium stearate is added and the mixing<br>
operation is continued for 1 to 5 min, according to the weight of mixture.<br>
The mixture obtained is compressed on a rotary machine to give tablets with<br>
the following characteristics:<br>
- average weight of between 665 mg and 735 mg;<br>
- breaking strength of between 20 and 50 N; and<br>
- average disintegration time in the mouth of less than 40 seconds.<br>
This disintegration time corresponds to the time between the moment when<br>
