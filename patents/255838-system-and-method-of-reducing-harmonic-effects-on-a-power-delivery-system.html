SYSTEM AND METHOD OF REDUCING HARMONIC EFFECTS<br>
ON A POWER DELIVERY SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This patent application claims priority to, and incorporates by<br>
reference in its entirety, pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/715,781,<br>
entitled "System and method to minimize harmonics for active controlled AC-AC<br>
power supply," filed September 9, 2005.<br>

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL ON DISK<br>
[0004] Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0005] A power supply to control the flow of energy between a first<br>
alternating current (AC) system and a second AC system is required in a variety of<br>
commercial and industrial applications, such as the control of AC motor operation.<br>
Some such power supplies convert the energy from a first frequency and voltage to a<br>
second frequency and voltage. One way to implement such a system is with a drive<br>
containing one or more power cells that include two solid state converters with an<br>
intermediate direct current (DC) link. A power cell is an electrical device that has a<br>
three-phase alternating current input and a single-phase alternating current output. One<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2007/030833	PCT/US2006/035602<br>
such system is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,625,545 to Hammond, the disclosure of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
[0006] Power cells may be either non-regenerative or regenerative. Non-<br>
regenerative power cells can drive a motor but cannot control the flow of current to<br>
brake a motor by absorbing regenerative power. Regenerative power cells have the<br>
capability of absorbing regenerative power and optionally returning it to the source,<br>
thus, allowing the cell to participating in braking the motor. Recently, power cells have<br>
been developed that use switching devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors<br>
(IGBTs) to allow the cell to assist in both driving and braking a motor. For example,<br>
referring to FIG. 1 herein, a power cell 160 includes an active front end 162 that serves<br>
as a three-phase bridge as it receives power from dedicated three-phase secondary<br>
windings of the transformer via an input 142. The cell 160 also includes a plurality of<br>
input switches 170 -175, which may be bidirectional current-controlling devices such<br>
as IGBTs or other transistors, thyristors, or other switching devices. Although six<br>
transistors in a bridge format - in this example, three pairs of two transistors each<br>
connected in parallel across the DC terminals - are illustrated in FIG. 1, other numbers<br>
and types of input switches may be used. The input switches control the DC bus<br>
voltage in the cell. A DC filter section 166 includes one or more capacitors 168. The<br>
remainder of the cell may include an output stage 164 such as an H-bridge inverter<br>
made up of four output switches 131-134, each connected across the output or DC<br>
terminals of the active front end 162 and the DC filter 166, to deliver AC power to the<br>
output 144.<br>
[0007] A circuit including power cells such as 160 in FIG. 1, when<br>
connected to a load such as a motor, can provide power from an input source to the<br>
-2~<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
motor when operating in the motoring mode. When input converter sections 162 such<br>
as those shown in FIG. 1 are used, drive switching events can product harmonic<br>
currents. Harmonic currents may also be produced when a single-phase inverter<br>
section is connected to a motor. The harmonics can be compounded when multiple<br>
cells have switches that operate at the same time.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent No. 5,625,545 discloses that a multi-winding transformer<br>
may be used to reduce harmonic currents created by a unidirectional, or non-<br>
regenerative, power cell. However, this method may not always reduce harmonics in<br>
regenerative power cells to a desired level. Other methods, such as using a master<br>
clock to generate synchronized carriers and applying the carriers to multiple converters<br>
connected to a transformer having non-phase shifted secondary windings, have not<br>
been entirely effective, and many increase drive complexity and cost.<br>
[0009] The disclosure contained herein describes attempts to reduce<br>
harmonics created by operating a power cell having bidirectional switching devices.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[ 0 010 ] In an embodiment, a method of controlling a power delivery system<br>
includes operating a system comprising a plurality of power cells that are electrically<br>
connected to a first transformer comprising one or more primary windings and a<br>
plurality of secondary windings such that each cell is electrically connected to one of<br>
the secondary windings and a plurality of the secondary windings are phase-shifted<br>
with respect to the primary windings. Each cell includes a plurality of switching<br>
devices. The method may include controlling the timing of activation of the switching<br>
devices within each cell so that an effective frequency of the activation for all of the<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2007/030833	PCT/US2006/035602<br>
cells as reflected to the primary is at least three times greater than the switching<br>
frequency of any individual cell. The controlling may not require the use of a<br>
synchronizing clock signal in some embodiments. For example, the controlling may<br>
include determining a carrier offset angle, passing the carrier offset angle to the first<br>
power cell, and synchronizing, by the first power cell, a carrier signal to the first<br>
secondary voltage based on the carrier offset angle. The method of also may include<br>
synchronizing, by each additional cell in the system, an additional carrier signal to a<br>
secondary voltage for each additional cell. The carrier signals for each cell may be<br>
interdigitated so that they arc distributed substantially evenly when reflected toward the<br>
primary windings of the source transformer. The carrier signal also may control the<br>
timing of implementation of commands that control the switching devices, such as<br>
switching devices that are part of an AC-to-DC converter portion of the cell. When a<br>
plurality of the cells determine that switching commands must be implemented, the<br>
carrier offset angle for each cell may ensure that the commands are effectively<br>
interdigitated as reflected to the primary of the transformer. A command may be<br>
implemented by the first power cell at a frequency substantially equal to a multiple of a<br>
fundamental frequency. The carrier offset angle may represent a phase relationship<br>
between the carrier signal of the first cell and the first secondary voltage.<br>
[0 011] Optionally, the method also may include operating a second system<br>
comprising a second transformer and a second plurality of power cells, wherein the<br>
second transformer comprises one or more primary windings and a plurality of<br>
secondary windings, the primary windings of the second transformer are electrically<br>
connected to the primary windings of the source transformer at a common point, and<br>
each power cell in the second system generates a carrier signal. The carrier signals for<br>
-4-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
each cell in the second system may be interdigitated so that they are distributed<br>
substantially evenly when reflected toward the primary windings of the secondary<br>
transformer.<br>
[0012] In an alternate embodiment, a method for operating a power delivery<br>
system includes operating a system comprising a plurality of power cells that are<br>
electrically connected to a first transformer comprising one or more primary windings<br>
and a plurality of secondary windings such that each cell is electrically connected to<br>
one of the secondary windings and a plurality of the secondary windings are phase-<br>
shifted with respect to the primary windings. Each cell includes a plurality of<br>
switching devices. A first secondary winding is electrically connected to deliver power<br>
to a first power cell. The method may include determining a carrier offset angle,<br>
passing the first carrier offset angle to the first power cell, and synchronizing, by the<br>
first power cell, a carrier signal to the first secondary voltage based on the first carrier<br>
offset angle. The method also may include, for a second cell that is connected to a<br>
second secondary winding of the source transformer, wherein the second secondary<br>
winding has a voltage that is phase-shifted with respect the voltage of the first<br>
secondary winding, synchronizing a second carrier signal to the second secondary<br>
voltage using a second carrier offset angle. The carrier signals for each cell that is<br>
electrically connected to the source transformer may be interdigitated so that they are<br>
distributed substantially evenly when reflected toward the primary windings of the<br>
source transformer. The carrier signals also control the timing of implementation of<br>
commands that control the switching devices, and the synchronizing controls the timing<br>
of activation of the switching devices within each cell so that an effective frequency of<br>
the activation for all of the cells as reflected to the primary is at least three times greater<br>
-5-<br><br>
WO 2007/030833	PCT/US2006/035602<br>
than the switching frequency of any individual cell. The switching devices may be part<br>
of an AC-to-DC converter portion of the cell. When multiple cells determine that<br>
switching commands must be implemented, the commands may be effectively<br>
interdigitated as reflected to the primary of the transformer. A command may be<br>
implemented by the first power cell at a frequency substantially equal to a multiple of a<br>
fundamental frequency. The carrier offset angle may represent a phase relationship<br>
between the carrier signal of the first cell and the first secondary voltage.<br>
[0013] In alternate embodiment, a method of operating a power delivery<br>
system, includes operating a system comprising a plurality of power cells that are<br>
electrically connected to a multi-winding machine comprising one or more primary<br>
windings and a plurality of secondary windings such that each cell is electrically<br>
connected to one of the secondary windings and a plurality of the secondary windings<br>
are phase-shifted with respect to the primary windings. The method includes<br>
determining, i'or each cell in a set of the power cells, a carrier offset angle, and<br>
synchronizing, by the each cell in the set, a carrier signal to the secondary voltage for<br>
the cell based on the carrier offset angle determined for the cell. The carrier signal for<br>
each cell controls the timing of operation of switching devices within the cell. A<br>
switching frequency for all of the cells may be at least three times greater than a<br>
switching frequency for any individual cell's carrier signal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] Before the present methods, systems and materials are described, it is<br>
to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular methodologies,<br>
systems and materials described, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the<br>
terminology used in the description is for the purpose of describing the particular<br>
versions or embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope. For example, as<br>
used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include<br>
plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Further, the word<br>
"comprising" means "including but not limited to." Unless defined otherwise, all<br>
technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly<br>
understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
-7-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
[ 0 0 2 3 ] In various embodiments, a multi-level power circuit includes a<br>
plurality of power cells to drive a load. FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of<br>
a circuit having such power cells. In FIG. 2, a multi-winding machine such as a source<br>
or input transformer 210 delivers three-phase, medium-voltage power to a load 230<br>
such as a three-phase induction motor via an array of single-phase inverters (also<br>
referred to as power cells). As used herein, the term "transformer" is intended to<br>
include any multi-winding machine that is normally on the supply side of the system.<br>
The transformer 210 includes primary windings 212 that excite a number of secondary<br>
windings 214 - 225. Although primary winding 212 is illustrated as having a star<br>
configuration, a mesh configuration is also possible. Further, although secondary<br>
windings 214 - 225 are illustrated as having a mesh configuration, star-configured<br>
secondary windings are possible, or a combination of star and mesh windings may be<br>
used. Further, the number of secondary windings illustrated in FIG. 2 is merely<br>
exemplary, and other numbers of secondary windings are possible. The circuit may be<br>
used for medium voltage applications or, in some embodiments, other applications. As<br>
used herein, medium voltage means a rated voltage greater than 690 volts (V) and less<br>
than 69 kilovolts (kV). In some embodiments, medium voltage may include voltages<br>
between about 1000 V and about 69 kV. In the embodiments described herein, each<br>
secondary winding is phase-shifted from the primary and other secondary windings by<br>
a predetermined amount based on the configuration of the windings. Exemplary phase<br>
shift angles may be about 0°, +30°, 0°, and -30°. Other phase shifts are possible.<br>
[0024] Any number of three-phase sets of power cells may be connected<br>
between the transformer 210 and the load 230. The power cells may include cells such<br>
as those having a configuration of that shown in FIG. 1, or the power cells may include<br>
-8-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
cells having one or more other configurations. Referring to FIG. 2, the system may<br>
include a first set or "rank" of power cells 251-253 across the three phases of the load, a<br>
second rank of power cells 261-263, a third rank of power cells 271-273, and a fourth<br>
rank of power cells 281-283. Fewer than four sets or ranks, or more than four sets or<br>
ranks, are possible. A central control system 295 sends command signals to a local<br>
controller 292 and/or cell-level controls in each cell over fiber optics or another wired<br>
or wireless communications medium 290.<br>
[0025] Referring to both FIGs. 1 and 2, direct current is delivered to the DC<br>
filter 166, and alternating current is delivered to the output 144 of a cell, based on<br>
controlling signals that the transistors 131-134 and 170-175 receive from local<br>
modulation controller 292. Controller 292 selects which transistors will be OFF or<br>
ON, thus modulating the power that is delivered to the output 144. Optionally,<br>
communications circuits such as fiber-optic modulator control links 290 can be used to<br>
electrically isolate all circuits in any one cell from all circuits in any other cell, and to<br>
reduce electromagnetic interference effects which may be imposed between local<br>
controller 292 and master modulation controller 295. Local modulation controller 292<br>
can receive power from a local control power source which may be electrically<br>
connected to the secondary winding circuit input.<br>
[0026] FIG. 3 shows one possible way of using a carrier signal to control a<br>
power cell such as the AC/DC power conversion apparatus described herein. In general,<br>
a control signal can be generated for each power output line. Further, each cell may<br>
include circuitry that generates a carrier signal, such as, for example, a triangular<br>
signal, having a fixed phase relationship to the voltage that the carrier receives from its<br>
electrically connected transformer secondary winding. Referring to FIG. 2 in the<br>
_9_<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
architecture of this example, each power output line, A, B, C, has four serially-<br>
connected power cells, for example, Al, A2, A3, and A4. The output of each power<br>
cell can be summed to produce a composite power output line signal. In addition, the<br>
composite power output line signals for each of power output lines A, B, C,<br>
respectively, can be summed to produce a composite total output signal which can be<br>
supplied to the load.<br>
[0027] In FIG. 3, a control signal 310 for a power output line oscillates at a<br>
frequency equal to or substantially equal to the fundamental frequency of the<br>
transformer primary, such as 50 hertz (Hz) or 60 Hz for example. Control signal 310 is<br>
compared with a triangular carrier signal, shown at 320, oscillating at the preselected<br>
switching frequency such as, for example, 1 kilohcrtz (kHz). A carrier signal 320 is a<br>
triangular shaped waveform having a frequency that is a multiple, and preferably an<br>
odd integer multiple, of the fundamental frequency of the control 310. The carrier<br>
signal controls when commands are operated by power cell, and thus the carrier signal<br>
controls switching of the devices within each cell. For example, each time that the<br>
carrier signal 320 and control signal 310 intersect, a command to operate one or more<br>
switching devices within the cell may be operated. Referring to FIG. 1, the switching<br>
devices that are operated by the commands may be devices 170 - 175 such as those in<br>
the active front end 162 (i.e., AC-to-DC converter portion) of the cell. The actual<br>
command (i.e., the switches selected for operation) may depend on the voltage<br>
delivered from the source transformer, signals received from the control system, and/or<br>
other factors.<br>
[0028] Each carrier signal within a power cell is phase-shifted by a certain<br>
amount with respect to both its corresponding transformer secondary and the other<br>
-10-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
carrier signals for the other power cells in the system. The phase shift may be<br>
dependent on the number of cells in the drive, the position of the cell in the drive, and<br>
the relative phase shift between the corresponding secondary winding voltage and the<br>
primary voltage. The phase shift of each carrier signal permits the interdigitation of<br>
carrier signals when viewed from the primary side of the source transformer, as can be<br>
seen in, for example, FIG. 5, which shows multiple interdigitated carrier signals,<br>
including 510, 520 and 530, as reflected to the primary winding of the source<br>
transformer. As seen in FIG. 5, the signals are substantially evenly distributed so that<br>
no to signals overlap and the distance between peaks is substantially consistent across<br>
all of the carrier signals.<br>
[0029] A result of such phase shifting may be that the effective switching<br>
frequency component on the primary windings of the source transformer will be<br>
increased by at least three times fc (i.e., where synchronization is done for at least three<br>
cells in the system), up to around N*fc, where N is the number of power cells and fc is<br>
the carrier frequency within an individual cell. In general, each cell's carrier signal will<br>
have substantially the same carrier frequency as the other cells' carrier signals.<br>
[0030] Referring to FIG. 4, in a method for reducing current harmonics a<br>
local modulation controller or other device may monitor or receive 410 the input source<br>
primary voltage (i.e., the transformer primary winding voltage). As indicated in FIG. 2,<br>
each cell 251-283 is electrically connected to a secondary winding 214-225 of the<br>
source transformer 210. Returning to FIG. 4, the cells monitor or receive 412 the<br>
secondary voltage and pass 414 the voltage to the local modulation controller, where<br>
the control calculates a carrier offset angle 416 using the transformer primary phase<br>
data, transformer secondary phase data for the cell, the number of cells in the drive, and<br>
-11-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
a drive carrier offset parameter. Any suitable method of determining a phase shift<br>
between cell carrier signals for a power circuit or drive having a multi-winding<br>
transformer with phase-shifted secondary windings may be used.<br>
[0031] As noted above, and as illustrated in FIG. 2, a carrier 320 is a<br>
triangular shaped waveform with a frequency that is an integer multiple of the<br>
frequency of the fundamental 310. In some embodiments, the carrier for each power<br>
cell can be described as having been constructed from the formula 2*arcsine(sine (2c +<br>
2co))/B , and a phase shift value 20 (330 in FIG. 3) represents a value for each cell that<br>
will interdigitate the carriers for all cells in the system, such as is illustrated in FIG. 5.<br>
The values listed above can be further understood by considering:<br>
[0032] Tc = HN • Tf This is the frequency of the carrier which is locked by a<br>
phase-locked loop within the cell to an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency<br>
and a predetermined phase angle 2co-<br>
[0033] 2c = J Tc dt This is the angle of the carrier as a function of time.<br>
[0034] 2co = 2CR + HN • 2o This is the carrier reference angle adjusted by<br>
another angle, 20, such that the carrier when reflected to the primary of the transformer<br>
is interdigitated among the carriers of the other cells.<br>
[0035] 2o= (2v • HN - (2B/N • (Trunc(R/3) + P + 2R)) modulo 2B) / HN In<br>
this equation, given N cells numbered 0 to N-l and a 2V value for each cell, 20 is<br>
determined as an angle that will interdigitate the carriers for all of the cells in the<br>
circuit.<br>
[0036] In the equations listed above:<br>
[0037] 2c = carrier angle (in radians)<br>
[0038] 2co = carrier offset in carrier reference frame<br>

PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
[0039] 2CR = carrier reference angle (which may be an arbitrary constant<br>
value that is equal in all cells)<br>
[0040] 2o = carrier offset in fundamental reference frame<br>
[0041] 2V = difference between primary and secondary voltage angle (or, in<br>
an alternate embodiment, a phase relationship between the secondary voltage and a<br>
selected reference waveform, such as another secondary voltage)<br>
[0042] 2R = stalling carrier offset in fundamental reference frame for the<br>
entire drive unit<br>
[0043] HN = fundamental to carrier frequency multiplier (any integer value)<br>
[0044] Tc = carrier frequency (in radians per second)<br>
[0045] Tf = fundamental frequency (in radians per second)<br>
[0046] N = total number of cells per output phase<br>
[0047] R = location of cell numbered from 0 to N-1<br>
[0048] P = output phase which contains the cell (-2B/3 for A, 0 for B, and<br>
2B/3 for C)<br>
[0049] The 2o value necessary to interdigitate the carriers may be calculated<br>
in many different ways, and the calculations may vary on a cell-by-cell basis. The<br>
carrier offset angle represents a fixed phase relationship between the carrier signal of a<br>
cell and the transformer secondary voltage provided to the cell. The calculations above<br>
represent one example, and the invention described herein is not limited to the above<br>
calculation. Any other method of calculating a carrier offset angle in a fundamental<br>
reference frame may be used. The example calculation requires a cell that can maintain<br>
a carrier synchronized to its secondary fundamental voltage at a desired angle relative<br>
to such a voltage, and a method of determining the difference between the primary<br>
-13-<br><br>
PCT/US2006/035602<br>
WO 2007/030833<br>
voltage and each cell's secondary voltage. Any methods of calculation now or<br>
hereafter known may be used.<br>
[0050] In the methods described herein, although a master clock may be used<br>
to determine an initial offset value, the master clock need not be used when performing<br>
synchronization, as the system has determined a set phase relationship for each carrier<br>
signal to the fundamental. Thus, a synchronizing clock signal is not required after the<br>
initial offset is determined.<br>
[0051] The controller may then pass 418 the earner offset angle to the<br>
appropriate cell with a phase angle offset with respect to the fundamental line voltage<br>
that results in the carrier signal being interdigitated with other carrier signals delivered<br>
to other cells. The carrier offset angle may be delivered to the cell as a synchronization<br>
signal that represents the phase angle relationship between the input voltage (i.e., the<br>
source or transformer primary voltage) and the actual secondary voltage in each cell.<br>
The synchronization signal may be part of the PWM carrier, or it may be delivered as a<br>
separate signal. The cell then synchronizes 420 its carrier signal to the secondary<br>
signal using the offset angle that it receives from the controller.<br>
[0052] FIG. 5 illustrates how multiple carrier signals 510, 520, 530, etc. for<br>
multiple cells may be interdigitated with each other in a synchronized manner to a<br>
reference signal 550, as reflected to the primary windings of the source transformer<br>
Each cell may have its own reference signal, and the reference signals for each cell will<br>
be similar but not necessarily the same. The carrier signal in each cell will determine<br>
when a switching command occurs within that cell. As shown in FIG. 5, since each<br>
carrier signal is phase-shifted from the carrier signals from the other cells by a<br>
predetermined amount (20), the effect of the switching commands for each cell as<br>
-14-<br><br>
WO 2007/030833	PCT/US2006/035602<br>
reflected to the primary of the transformer will be spaced out over a period of time<br>
based on the 2o value, or the spacing of the interdigitation. Thus, instead of all cells<br>
effectively implementing the same switching operation at the same time (which would<br>
cause a large harmonic disturbance), the effect of the switching operations at the<br>
primary of the transformer occur in rapid sequence based on the substantially even<br>
offset of the carrier signals. In addition, since the effective frequency of the carrier<br>
signals seen at the source transformer primary is relatively high (such as on the order of<br>
about fc »N), the harmonics may be further smoothed, as the impedance of the source<br>
transformer itself may filter our some or all of the high-frequency harmonics.<br>
[0053 ] In some embodiments, multiple drives may be connected to a single<br>
transformer or a group of transformers sharing a common primary voltage. In such a<br>
situation, multiple drives may have their carrier signals interdigitated by adjusting the<br>
drive carrier offset angle (2R) for each drive and setting each drive to the same carrier<br>
frequency.<br>
[0054] In the embodiments provided herein, the interdigitation of the carrier<br>
signals may increase the frequency of the voltage harmonics and reduce the peaks of<br>
the voltage harmonics, which in turn may reduce current harmonics. For example, FIG.<br>
6 illustrates an exemplary trace of one phase of voltage 610 and current 620 delivered<br>
to a load from a drive having twenty-one regenerative power cells using a source<br>
transformer rated for 7200 volts primary and 600 volts secondary. In the data shown in<br>
FIG. 6, although the source transformer had phase-shifted secondaries, carrier de-<br>
synchronization (i.e., the shifting of the carrier signals by an offset) was not performed,<br>
and both voltage and current harmonics are obvious in the traces. FIGs. 7 and 8 show<br>
-15-<br><br>
WO 2007/030833	PCT/US2006/035602<br>
traces of current 720 and voltage 810 on the same circuit after the application of carrier<br>
synchronization methods such as those described herein.<br>
[0055] In some embodiments, interdigitation of the switching events may<br>
occur using known methods other than adjustment of a carrier signal. For example, if<br>
space vector modulation is used instead of sine triangle methods as described herein,<br>
the method still may include interdigitating the effective timing of switching events as<br>
reflected to the primary.<br>
[0056] Still other embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled<br>
in this ait from reading the above-recited detailed description and drawings of certain<br>
exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that numerous variations,<br>
modifications, and additional embodiments are possible, and accordingly, all such<br>
variations, modifications, and embodiments are to be regarded as being within the spirit<br>
and scope of this application<br>
