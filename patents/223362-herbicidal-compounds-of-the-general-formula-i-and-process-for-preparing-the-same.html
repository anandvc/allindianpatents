The novel 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-oxyacetanilides of the gen-eral formula (I) have interesting biological properties. In particular, they have strong and selective herbicidal activity.<br>
The novel 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-oxyacetaniIides of the gen-formula (I) are obtained whe5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-l,3,4-thiadiazoles of the formula (II)<br><br>
are reacted with hydroxyacetanilides of the general formula (III)<br><br>
in which<br>
n, R and X are each as defined above,<br>
if appropriate in the presence of an acid binder and if appropriate in the presence of a diluent.<br>
Using, for example, 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole and N-(t-butyl)-N-(3-fluoro-phenyl)-2-hydroxyacetamide as starting materials, the course of the reaction in the process according to the invention can be illustrated by the fol¬lowing formula scheme:<br><br>
The compound 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole of the formula (II) to be used as starting material in the process according to the invention for preparing compounds of the general formula (I) is already known (cf. EP-A-298338).<br>
The compound 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole of the formula (II) is obtained when, for example, in a first step, chlorodifluoroacetic acid (ClF2C-COOH) is reacted with methyl dithiocarbazide (NH2NH-C(S)-S-CH3) in the presence of phosphoryl chloride (P(O)Cl3) at temperatures between 0°C and 100°C, and the resulting compound 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylthio-l,3,4-thiadiazole is reacted with an oxidizing agent, such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), if appropriate in the presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, sodium tungstate, and<br>
Appropriate in the presence of a diluent, such as, for example, acetic acid, at tem¬peratures between 0°C and 50°C (cf. the Preparation Examples).<br>
The formula (III) provides a general definition of the hydroxyacetanilides to be used as starting materials in the process according to the invention for preparing com¬pounds of the general formula (I). In the general formula (III), n, R and X each pref¬erably or in particular have those meanings which have already been mentioned above, in connection with the description of the compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention, as being preferred or as being particularly preferred for n, R and X.<br>
The starting materials of the general formula (III) are known and/or can be prepared by processes known per se (cf. EP-A-18749, EP-A-148501, EP-A-165537, EP-A-308740, EP-A-348735, EP-A-348737, EP-A-626380).<br>
Suitable diluents for carrying out the process according to the invention for preparing the compounds of the general formula (I) are, in addition to water, especially inert organic solvents. These include, in particular, aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic, option-ally halogenated hydrocarbons, such as, for example, benzine, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, petroleum ether, hexane, cyclohexane, di-chloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diiso-propyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether or ethylene glycol diethyl ether; ketones, such as acetone, butanone or methyl isobutyl ketone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile or butyronitrile; amides, such as N,N-di-methylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-formanilide, N-methyl-pyrro-lidone or hexamethylphosphoric triamide; esters, such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, sulphoxides, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, alcohols, such as methanol, etha-nol, n- or i-propanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl -ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, mix-tures thereof with water or pure water.<br>
firitable acid binders for the process according to the invention are, in general, the customary inorganic or organic bases or acid acceptors. These preferably include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal acetates, amides, carbonates, bicarbonates, hy-drides, hydroxides or alkoxides, such as, for example, sodium acetate, potassium acetate or calcium acetate, lithium amide, sodium amide, potassium amide or calcium amide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or calcium carbonate, sodium bicar-bonate, potassium bicarbonate or calcium bicarbonate, lithium hydride, sodium hy-dride, potassium or calcium hydride, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potas-sium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, ethoxide, n- or i-propox-ide, n-, i-, s- or t-butoxide or potassium methoxide, ethoxide, n- or i-propoxide, n-, i-, s- or t-butoxide; furthermore also basic organic nitrogen compounds, such as, for example, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, ethyl-diiso-propylamine, N,N-dimethyl-cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamme, ethyl-dicyclo-hexylamine, N,N-dimethyl-aniline, N,N-dimethyl-benzylamine, pyridine, 2-methyl-, 3-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 2,4-dimethyl-, 2,6-dimethyl-, 3,4-dimethyl- and 3,5-dimethyl-pyridine, 5-ethyl-2-methyl-pyridine 4-dimethylamino-pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine, l,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]-octane (DABCO), l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-non-5-ene (DBN) or 1,8- diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU).<br>
When carrying out the process according to the invention, the reaction temperatures can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the process is carried out at temperatures between -20°C and 100°C, preferably between 0°C and 60°C.<br>
The process according to the invention is generally carried out under atmospheric pressure. However, it is also possible to carry out the process according to the inven-tion under elevated or reduced pressure - in general between 0.1 bar and 10 bar.<br>
For carrying out the process according to the invention, the starting materials are generally employed in approximately equimolar amounts. However, it is also possi-ble to use a relatively large excess of one of the components. The reaction is gener-ally carried out in a suitable diluent in the presence of an acid binder, and the reac-<br>
On mixture is generally stirred at the required temperature for several hours. Work-up is carried out by customary methods (cf. the Preparation Examples).<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as defoliants, desic-cants, haulm killers and, especially, as weedkillers. By weeds in the broadest sense there are to be understood all plants which grow in locations where they are unde-sired. Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective her-bicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in con-nection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Abutilon, Amaranthus, Ambrosia, Anoda, An-themis, Aphanes, Atriplex, Bellis, Bidens, Capsella, Carduus, Cassia, Centaurea, Chenopodium, Cirsium, Convolvulus, Datura, Desmodium, Emex, Erysimum, Euphorbia, Galeopsis, Galinsoga, Galium, Hibiscus, Ipomoea, Kochia, Lamium, Lepidium, Lindernia, Matricaria, Mentha, Mercurialis, Mullugo, Myosotis, Papaver, Pharbitis, Plantago, Polygonum, Portulaca, Ranunculus, Raphanus, Rorippa, Rotala, Rumex, Salsola, Senecio, Sesbania, Sida, Sinapis, Solanum, Sonchus, Sphenoclea, Stellaria, Taraxacum, Thlaspi, Trifolium, Urtica, Veronica, Viola, Xanthium.<br>

Monocotyledonous crops of the genera: Allium, Ananas, Asparagus, Avena, Hor-deum, Oryza, Panicum, Saccharum, Secale, Sorghum, Triticale, Triticum, Zea.<br>
However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By plants are to be understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimiza-tion methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combina-tions of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by plant breeders certificates. Parts of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit-bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Parts of plants also include harvested plants and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by one- or multi-layer coating.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds are suitable for total weed control, for example on industrial terrain and rail tracks and on paths and areas with or without tree growth. Equally, the active compounds according to the invention can<br>
A employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example forests, ornamen-tal tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards, banana planta-tions, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns and turf and pastures and for selective weed control in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal activity and a broad activity spectrum when applied on the soil and on above-ground parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for the selective control of monocotyledenous and dicotyledenous weeds in monocotyledenous and dicotyl-edenous crops, both by the pre-emergence and the post-emergence method.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric sub-stances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the ac-tive compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated ali-phatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl<br>
/<br>
Stone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diato-maceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and frac-tionated natural rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite and syn-thetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material, such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyeth-ylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hy-drolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use dyestuffs, such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide, Prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.f<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, plant nutrients and agents which improve soil structure, is also possible.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or in the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-to-use solutions, sus¬pensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, scattering.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be applied both before and after emergence of the plants. They can also be incorporated into the soil before sowing.<br>
The amount of active compound used can vary within a relatively wide range. It de¬pends essentially on the nature of the desired effect. In general, the amounts used are between 1 g and 10 kg of active compound per hectare of soil surface, preferably between 5 g and 5 kg per ha.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention can be seen from the examples below.<br><br><br><br>
Preparation Examples Example 1<br><br><br><br>
A mixture of 10 g ( 47 mmol) of N-i-propyl-N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-hydroxy-acet-amide, 11.8 g (47 mmol) of 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-l,3,4-thia-diazole and 50 ml of acetone is cooled to -20°C and, at this temperature, admixed dropwise with stirring with a solution of 3 g (75 mmol) of sodium hydroxide in 8 ml of water. The reaction mixture is stirred at -10°C for 25 hours and then diluted with water to about three times its original volume and extracted with methylene chloride. The organic phase is washed with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under water-pump vacuum, the residue is digested with ligroine and the resulting crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 10 g (56% of theory) of N-i-propyl-N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-2-(5-chloro-difiuoromethyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl-oxy)-acetamide of melting point 98°C.<br>
Analogously to Example 1, and in accordance with the general description of the preparation process according to the invention, it is also possible to prepare, for ex¬ample, the compounds of the general formula (I) listed in Table 1 below.<br><br><br><br><br>
/ Starting material of the formula (II)<br>
Example II-l <br>
Stepl<br><br>
393 g (3 mol) of chlorodifluoroacetic acid are mixed with 372 g (3 mol) of methyl di-thiocarbazide. Over a period of two hours, 1000 g (6.54 mol) of phosphoryl chloride are then added dropwise to this mixture, whereupon evolution of gas sets in. The reaction mixture is then heated slowly to from 70°C to 80°C and kept at this temperature for about 3 hours, during which evolution of gas slowly ceases. The mixture is then poured onto about 3 kg of ice and allowed to stand until most of the excess phosphoryl chloride has been decomposed. The mixture is then shaken with chloroform and the organic phase is separated off, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under waterpump vacuum and the residue is worked up by distillation under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 564 g (87% of theory) of 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylthio-l,3,4-thia-diazole of boiling point 62°C (at 0.2 mbar).<br>
Step 2 <br><br>
/ Over a period of two hours, 49.5 g of a 35% strength aqueous hydrogen peroxide<br>
solution (0.57 mol of H2O2) are added dropwise with stirring to a mixture of 22 g<br>
(0.10 mol) of 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylthio-l,3,4-thiadiazole, 1 g of sodium<br>
tungstate and 70 ml of acetic acid, the reaction temperature being maintained at from<br>
20°C to 25°C. At this temperature, the reaction mixture is stirred for 20 hours and<br>
then stirred with 150 ml of chloroform. The organic phase is separated off, washed<br>
with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. From the filtrate, the solvent is<br>
carefully distilled off under reduced pressure.<br>
This gives 22.5 g (91% of theory) of 5-chlorodifluoromethyl-2-methylsulphonyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole of melting point 46°C.<br><br>
Use Examples Example A<br>
Pre-emergence test<br>
Solvent:	5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsi¬fier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Seeds of the test plants are sown in normal soil. After 24 hours, the soil is sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amount of active compound desired is applied per unit area. The active compound concentration in the spray liquor is chosen so that the particular amount of active compound desired is applied in 1000 liters of water per hectare.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in com¬parison to the development of the untreated control. The figures denote:<br>
0 %      =       no effect (like untreated control) 100% =       total destruction<br>
In this test, for example, the compound of Preparation Example 1 shows very strong activity against weeds, and it is tolerated well by crop plants, such as, for example, soya and wheat.<br><br>
Table A:   Pre-emergence test/greenhouse<br><br>
Example B<br>
Post-emergence test<br>
Solvent:	5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:	1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of emulsi¬fier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Test plants which have a height of 5 to 15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of active compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen so that the par-ticular amounts of active compound desired are applied in 1000 1 of water/ha.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in com-parison to the development of the untreated control.<br><br><br><br>
