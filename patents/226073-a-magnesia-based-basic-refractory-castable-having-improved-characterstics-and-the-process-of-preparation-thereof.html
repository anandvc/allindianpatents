				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a magnesia based basic refractory castable having improved characteristics and the process of preparation thereof. The present invention particularly relates to a magnesia basic castable mix, for the production of magnesia based basic refractory castable having improved characteristics which can be used in the iron and steel industries in the severe slag corrosion areas requiring enhanced strength, durability and stability.<br>
Background of the invnetion<br>
The present invention is useful for producing magnesia based basic refractory castable for application as monolithic lining in the basic processes of steel making technology where excellent resistance against basic slag as well as low vulnerability to attack by iron oxide and alkalis are the prime requirement, particularly for the electric arc furnace, basic oxygen furnace, steel ladle lining and flow control devices for continuous casting. Such types of basic castable also find applications in the glass tank furnace regenerators.<br>
Magnesia based refractory castable is produced by mixing suitably graded sintered / fused magnesia refractory aggregates, fines, bond materials and some property modifying additives. Magnesia is the mostly accepted basic refractory raw material with high melting point, very good chemical stability, excellent corrosion resistance against high basicity slag and iron oxide &amp; alkalis. In spite of these many advantageous properties of magnesia, magnesia based castables are not commercially highly successful even today due to the susceptibility of magnesia towards hydration leading to volume expansion and cracking. This hydration of magnesia finally results a castable body with very poor mechanical characteristics. In the present day method suitably graded sintered or fused magnesia aggregates, fines, various types of bonding materials such as calcium alumina cement, magnesium oxysulphate cement, magnesium silicate hydrate, mono aluminium phosphate, and other admixtures are thoroughly mixed with required amount of water. To improve the hydration resistance of magnesia, different workers in this<br><br>
field have used various additives which improves the strength retainment properties of the basic castable up to certain limit.<br>
Reference may be drawn to the work of A. Watanabe, H. Takahashi, S. Takanaga<br>
and M. Uchida, paper presented at UNITECR 95, in Kyoto, Japan, Nov 19-22, 1995,<br>
wherein the hydration resistance of magnesia was improved by the addition of fine<br>
alumina.<br>
It is also cited in the literature that incorporation of medium sized fused silica grains<br>
improved the slag penetration resistance and volume stability of the basic castable.<br>
In another reference, Transactions of the Indian Ceramic Society 56 [6] Nov -Dec<br>
1997,	by R. Basu, P. K. Das Poddar and S. K. Das, it is reported that incorporation<br>
of MgO-AI203 gel in the magnesium oxysulphate based basic castable has a<br>
beneficial effect on the improvement and retainment of room temperature and high<br>
temperature strengths. However it is also reported that the dehydration and<br>
decomposition of the bond material are accompanied with a decrease in strength of<br>
the castable at the intermediate temperatures.<br>
Reference may also be made to S. Narayanan, D. G. Banawalikar and S. D. Majumdar, Proceedings of the 3rd India International Refractory Congress, vol. I,<br>
1998,	wherein the dissolution precipitation reaction in presence of moisture was<br>
identified as the main cause of magnesia hydration. The workers formed a<br>
phosphate based chelate compound by capturing the dissolved magnesium ions<br>
from the surface of the magnesia grains. It was reported that this phosphatic<br>
material formed lime alkali phosphate compound, which was stable up to 1700°C<br>
and imparts strength in the body.<br>
Hydraulically bonded magnesia based refractory castable may also be referred from the work of Guy Denier and Romain Henrion, Institute de Recherches de la Siderugie Francaise, Arbed, S. Africa, US patent no. 4696456 and 4779846. This hydraulically bonded castable although provides sufficient fluidity, the hydraulic<br><br>
bond breaks at the intermediate temperature and finally leads to 12 - 15% deterioration in strength values.<br>
In another reference, Proceeding of the 5th India International Refractory Congress, vol. I, 2002, B. Myhre, C. Odegard and H. Feldborg, used MgO-Si02-H20 bond system for the production of magnesia based basic castable and found poor refractoriness under load properties when combinations of different magnesites were used in presence of micro silica.<br>
In all the above noted prior art of present day methods the main drawbacks are:<br>
a)	slaking of magnesia due to dissolution which brings about precipitation reaction of magnesia in presence of water leading to volume expansion and cracking,<br>
b)	poor strength retaining capacity due to disrupture of bonds at the intermediate temperatures,<br>
c)	structural spalling caused by absorbing slag into the structure and expansion and contraction on thermal cycling of heating and cooling,<br>
d)	calcium aluminate cement binder used as hydraulic bond forms low melting compounds and eutectics at higher temperature thus restricts the high temperature applications,<br>
e)	dehydration and decomposition of magnesium oxysulphate binder system accompanied by a decrease in mechanical strength of the castable up to a certain temperature which is critical during application,<br>
f)	tailored made properties are not achievable.<br>
From the above noted drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art, it is clear that there is a definite need for magnesia based basic refractory castable having improved characteristics.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a magnesia based basic refractory castable having improved characteristics and the process of preparation<br><br><br>
thereof, which obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art as described above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide magnesia based basic refractory castable which does not develop crack and deteriorate its strength during heating.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide magnesia based basic refractory castable which does not form low eutectic liquid phases at higher temperatures.<br>
In the present invention magnesia based basic refractory castable developed using sintered magnesite aggregates of different size fractions, high temperature bonding material such as barium aluminate, reactive alumina fines as major raw materials. The binary phase diagram of BaO-AI203 system provides the existence of various phases (BA, B3A and BA6; B = BaO and A = AI2O3) and all these phases have higher melting points (BA - 1815°C, B3A - 1620°C and BA6 - 1915°C) than the calcium aluminate phases (CA - 1600°C, CA2 - 1720°C and C12A7 - 1455°C; C = CaO and AI2O3). The higher melting point of barium aluminate cement phases resulted in a castable material in the present invention with higher refractoriness. It is also reported in the literature by M. Drozdz and W. Wolek, Bull. Soc. Fr. Ceram., No 107, 1975 that barium aluminate cement posses low coefficient of thermal expansion as compared to calcium aluminate cement and this particular advantageous property of barium aluminate cement offered higher resistance against thermal shock of the presently developed castable material. Use of barium aluminate cement in magnesia based refractory castable resulted only 3 - 4% deterioration in strength with heating in the range of 110°C to 1400°C, as compared to 12 - 15% deterioration in case of presently available calcium aluminate cement bonded basic castable and as high as 60 - 68% deterioration for the magnesium oxysulphate bonded magnesia based basic castable even with gel additives.<br><br><br>
Significantly less deterioration in strength during heating in case of barium aluminate cement bonded basic refractory castable is obtained in the present invention due to its quick rate of bonding and strong binding power. Owing to the great water sensivity of barium aluminate cement and slaking tendency of magnesia in water, reactive alumina fine is used in the presently developed castable material which instantly reacts with water and forms a strong bond with other ingredients, thereby reducing the slaking tendency of magnesia and negative effect on the consolidation of the barium aluminate cement bond. The magnesia basic castable mix, a synergistic composition, of the present invention is particularly useful for the production of magnesia based basic refractory castable which can be used in the iron and steel industries in the severe slag corrosion areas where enhanced strength, durability and stability characteristics are required.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>

The non-obvious inventive step of the present invention lies in providing a mixture of sintered magnesite aggregate of a mix of size fractions, high temperature barium aluminate cement binder along with reactive alumina fines to produce the magnesia based basic castable material which not only increases the strength retainment capacity significantly with heating but also increases the refractoriness property.<br>
