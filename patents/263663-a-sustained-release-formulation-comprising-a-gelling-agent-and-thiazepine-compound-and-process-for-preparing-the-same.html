				<td>The present invention relates to a sustained release formulation comprising a gelling agent and thiazepine compound and process for preparing the same.<br>
It is desirable in the treatment of a number of diseases, both therapeutically and prophylactically, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a sustained release form. Desirably the sustained release provides a generally uniform and constant rate of release over an extended period of time which achieves a stable and desired blood (plasma) level of the active ingredient without the need for frequent administration of the medicament.<br>
While there are numerous sustained release formulations known in the art which utilize gelling agents, such as hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses, it has been found to be difficult to formulate sustained release formulations of soluble medicaments and gelling agents, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, for several reasons. First of all, active ingredients which are soluble in water tend to generate a sustained release product which is susceptible to a phenomenon known as dose dumping. That is, release of the active ingredient is delayed for a time but once release begins to occur the rate of release is very high. Moreover, fluctuations tend to occur in the plasma concentrations of the active ingredient which increases the likelihood of toxicity. Further, some degree of diurnal variation in plasma . concentration of the active ingredient has also been observed. Finally, it has been found to be difficult to achieve the desired dissolution profiles or to control the rate of release of the soluble medicament.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for sustained release formulations of soluble medicaments, such as, ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]-dibenzo[b,f][l,4]thiazepine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, which overcome, or at least alleviate, one or more of the above described difficulties and which further provide the advantageous property of allowing the active medicament to be<br><br>
administered less frequently, e.g. once a day, while achieving blood (plasma) levels similar to those attained by administering smaller doses of the medicament more frequently, e.g. two or more times daily.<br>
Figure 1 shows the release (dissolution) profiles of the sustained release formulations of Examples 8,9 and 10 which are obtained by immersing a suitable tablet in 750 mL of 0.1 N HC1 for 2 hours at 37°C and a speed of 100 rpm and then adding 250 mL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer to the dissolution media to afford a pH of 6.2.<br>
Figure 2 shows the plasma concentration versus time profiles of the active ingredient for the sustained release formulations of examples 1 and 2 and the immediate release formulation of example 12.<br>
The compound, ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]- 1-piperazinyl]-dibenzo[b,f][l,4]thiazepine (see Formula I below), and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts exhibit useful antidopaminergic activity and may be used, for<br>

I<br>
example, as an antipsychotic agent (for example, for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders) or as a treatment for hyperactivity. It is a compound of particular interest since it may be used as an antipsychotic agent with a substantial reduction in the potential to cause side effects such as acute dystonia, acute dyskinesia, pseudo-Parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia which side-effects may result from the use of other antipsychotics or neuroleptics.<br>
The preparation, physical properties and beneficial pharmacological properties of ll-[4-[2-(2- hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo[b,f][l,4]-thiazepine, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in published European Patents EP 240,228 and 282,236 as well as in U.S. Patent 4,879,288, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a sustained release formulation comprising a gelling agent, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and 1 l-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo-[b,f][l,4]thiazepine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Preferably, the sustained release formulation comprises a hydrophilic matrix comprising a gelling agent, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo-[b,f][l,4]thiazepine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>

Formulations of particular interest include those described in the accompanying Examples and so formulations substantially as defined in the accompanying Examples are provided as a further feature of the present invention.<br>
As mentioned above, the compound ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo[b,f]]l,4]-thiazepine, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, exhibit useful antidopaminergic activity and may be used, for example, as an antipsychotic agent (for example, for the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders) or as a treatment for hyperactivity. Thus, the present invention also provides a method of treating psychotic states, for example psychosis, in a warm-blooded animal, such as man, which comprises administering<br>
-10-an effective amount of the formulation of the present invention to said warm-blooded animal.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of treating hyperactivity in a warm-blooded animal which comprises administering to said warm-blooded animal an effective amount of a formulation of the present invention.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may be prepared by conventional technology well known to those skilled in the art such as wet granulation, direct compression, dry compaction (slugging) and the like. Thus, for example, the active ingredient ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]-dibenzo[b,f]-[l,4]thiazepine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a gelling agent, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and other excipients are mixed together to form the sustained release formulations of the present invention. Preferably the active ingredient ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]-dibenzo[b,fj[l,4]thiazepine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a gelling agent, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and other excipients are mixed together to form a mixture suitable for compressing into tablets, which mixture is then compressed to form tablets or is filled into capsules<br>
The mixing process is preferably carried out by mixing the components, wet granulating the mixed components, drying the mixture, milling the dried mixture, blending the mixture with a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and compressing the blended mixture to form tablets or filling the blended mixture into capsules.<br>
A preferred process for preparing the formulations of the invention comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)       mixing ll-[4-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo[b,f][l,4]-thiazepine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a gelling agent, preferably hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and other excipients;<br>
(b)       wet granulating the mixed components;<br>
-11-<br>
(c)       drying the mixture;<br>
(d)       milling the dried mixture;<br>
(e)       blending the mixture with a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and<br>
(f)       compressing the blended mixture to form tablets.<br>
The dosage forms may be coated with one or more coatings as is well known in the art such as, for example, shellac, zein, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, ethyl cellulose, polymethacrylates, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, triacetin, dibutyl sebacate, a mixture of polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and the like.<br>
The sustained release properties of the formulation of the present invention may be demonstrated by monitoring the dissolution of the active ingredient. The dissolution of the active ingredient may be monitored using standard procedures well known to those skilled in the art (e.g. the dissolution test procedures, such as the Rotating Basket Method (Apparatus I) or Paddle Method (Apparatus II), disclosed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)). Such procedures include those in which the formulation is immersed in an aqueous medium such as water or hydrochloric acid and aliquots of the medium are withdrawn at various time points over a period of 24 hours. The aliquots are analyzed using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection to determine the concentration of dissolved active ingredient using standard methodology. In a particular example a tablet is immersed in about 900 mL of water and the dissolution profile determined. In another particular example, the dissolution profile is determined by the Rotating Basket method by immersing a tablet in 750 mL of 0.1 N HC1 for 2 hours at a speed of 100 rpm and then adding 250 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer to the dissolution media to afford a pH of 6.2.<br>
The formulation preferably releases the active ingredient in a controlled manner over a period of up to about 8 hours or longer. For example, the<br>
formulation described in Example 2 below released about 90% of the active ingredient over 16 hours, and the formulation described in Example 1 released about 90% of the active ingredient over a period of 8 hours.<br>
The plasma concentration versus time profiles of the active ingredient illustrated in Figure 2 were obtained utilizing the following procedure. Thirty-two patients were assigned to either Group A or Group B with 16 patients in each group. After a 2-day drug-free period (days 1 and 2), all patients were given oral doses of the immediate release formulation of example 12 twice daily for a 9-day period (days 3 through 11) with fixed step-wise increases in dose from 25 to 200 mg. Starting on day 12, patients began a randomized treatment sequence within their respective groups (Group A or B). Group A patients followed a treatment sequence that included one of each of the following formulations of the active ingredient administered according to the sequence randomized: two 100 mg tablets of the immediate release formulation of example 12 while fasting administered every 12 hours (Treatment 1), one 400 mg tablet of the formulation of example 2 while fasting (Treatment 2) and one 400 mg tablet of the formulation of example 2 with a meal (Treatment 3). Group B patients were randomized to a treatment sequence that included one of each of the following formulations of the active ingredient administered according to the sequence randomized: two 100 mg tablets of the immediate release formulation of example 12 while fasting administered every 12 hours (Treatment 1), one 400 mg tablet of the formulation of example 1 while fasting (Treatment 4) and one 400 mg tablet of the formulation of example 1 with a meal (Treatment 5). On days 12, 16 and 20 patients received trial treatment according to their assigned treatment sequences. On the evenings of days 13 and 17, patients received 200 mg doses of the immediate release formulation of example 12 and on days 14, 15, 18 and 19 the patients received 200 mg dose of the immediate release formulation of example 12 twice daily. Blood samples were taken from each subject on days 3, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 19 before the morning dose. On days, 12, 16 and 20 blood samples were taken from each subject immediately before dose administration<br>
and at specified time intervals from immediately after dose administration to 36 hours after dose administration. The concentration of the active ingredient in the blood samples was quantified using liquid-liquid extraction and high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance detection. The plasma concentration of the active ingredient over time profiles for the formulations of examples 1 (n = 11), 2 (n = 10) and 12 (n = 10 for Group A and 12 for Group B) are illustrated in Figure 2 and Table A summarizes the mean area under the curve (AUC) values for a 24 hour dosing interval and the mean maximum blood concentration (Cmax) values for each of the examples.<br>

The dose of the compound of the present invention which is administered will necessarily be varied according to principles well known in the art taking account of the route of administration, the duration of treatment, the severity of the psychotic condition, the size and age of the patient, the potency of the active component and the patient's response thereto. An effective dosage amount of the active component can thus readily be determined by the clinician after a consideration of all criteria and using his best judgment on the patient's behalf. In general, the compound will be administered to a warm blooded animal (such as man) so that an effective dose is received, generally a daily dose in the range of about 0.01 to about 40 mg/kg body weight. For example, when administered orally, it is generally administered in the range of about 0.1 to about 40 mg/kg body weight.<br>
Preferably, the compound of the present invention is administered in about a 25, 50, 200, 300 or 400 mg strength.<br>
The formulation of the present invention will, in general, be in the form of a unit dosage form, and, in particular, the formulation will be in the form of a tablet.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the formulation can be co-administered with other therapeutic or prophylactic agents and/or medicaments that are not medically incompatible therewith. The formulation of the present invention does not, in general, show any indication of overt toxicity in laboratory test animals at several multiples of the minimum effective dose of the active ingredient.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples in which temperatures are expressed in degrees Celsius. The compound 11-[4-[2-(2- hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-l-piperazinyl]dibenzo[b,f]]l,4]-thiazepine, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may be prepared as described in published European Patents EP 240,228 or 282,236 as well as in U.S. Patent 4,879,288, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The following process was used to prepare tablets having the composition defined in Table 1.<br>
11 - [4- [2-(2-hydroxyethoxy )ethyl] -1 -piperaziny 1] -dibenzo-[b,f]]l,4]thiazepine hemifumurate (3453.8g), lactose (1144.7g), microcrystalline cellulose (381.5g) and METHOCEL® E50LV (900g) were blended in a planetary mixer for approximately 3 minutes.<br>
The mixture was wet granulated in a planetary mixer using purified water. The wet mass was dried in a fluidized bed drier at about 65°C until the loss on drying was less than about 3% as measured by a moisture balance.<br>
The dried granulation was milled using a hammer type or similar mill operating at fast speed, knives forward with suitable screen (e.g. 20 to 40 mesh).<br>
Magnesium stearate was passed through an appropriate screen (e.g. 20 to 40 mesh).<br>
The dry granulated material was blended for approximately 3 minutes in a conventional blender (for example, Patterson-Kelley Twin Shell) with the screened magnesium stearate.<br>
The blended mixture was compressed into tablets using a conventional rotary tablet press (for example, Kilian LX-21).<br>

The above described immediate release composition was prepared by the following process: The active ingredient, povidone, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, and portions of the microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate were mixed in a mixer-granulator (for example, a Littleford MGT) for approximately 5 minutes. Purified water was added while mixing until a suitable mass was obtained. The wet granules were passed through a cone mill fitted with an appropriate screen (e.g. 6.35 mm) and then were dried in a fluidized bed dryer set at an inlet temperature of approximately 65°C to a loss on drying level of less than 2.5% w/w. The dried granules were then passed through a suitable mill fitted with an appropriate screen (e.g. #20 mesh in a hammer mill). The granulation was combined in a blender (e.g. V-blender) with lactose and the remainder of the microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate and was blended for approximately 5 minutes. The magnesium stearate was passed through a suitable mill fitted with an appropriate screen (e.g. 40 mesh) and then was added to the dry granulated material and blended for approximately 3 minutes. The blended mixture was then compressed into tablets using conventional rotary compression equipment. The tablets were then film coated using conventional drum coating equipment with an aqueous suspension of the film coating constituents (i.e. hydroxypropyl<br>
methylcellulose, polyethylene glycol 400, yellow ferric oxide and titanium dioxide) at an inlet temperature of approximately 80°C.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
