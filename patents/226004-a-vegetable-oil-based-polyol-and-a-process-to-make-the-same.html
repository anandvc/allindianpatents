VEGETABLE OIL BASED POLYOLS AND POLYURETHANES MADE THEREFROM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to improved methods of making<br>
vegetable based polyols to make, for example, polyurethane<br>
 foams.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polyurethanes are produced by the reaction of polyisocyanates and polyols. The first large scale commercial production of polyurethanes arose using polyester polyols from the ester condensation reaction of diols or polyols and dicarboxylic acids to make flexible foams. The polyester polyols were supplanted by polyether polyols because of lower cost and ability to make a wide range of polyols.  Polyethers are made by polymerizing epoxides (oxiranes) derived from petroleum feedstocks with active hydrogen starting compounds (polyols and polyamines).<br>
Rigid polyurethane foams have been made with castor oil or castor oil byproducts.  Castor oil has been used in rigid foams because of its low molecular weight (short chain length) and high functionality (trihydroxyl) .<br>
Attempts have been made to make polyols from vegetable or renewable feedstocks such as those disclosed by Peerman et al., US. Patent Nos. 4,423,162; 4,496,487 and 4,543,369. Peerman et al. describe a method reacting a hydroxyester monomer with a polyol or polyamine. However, Peerman et al., specifically describe problems of gelling, which can be avoided by limiting the extent of conversion or by using quantities of reactants far from the amounts required stoichiometrically. Consequently, Peerman et al., only describe elastomers (crosslinked rigid polyurethanes) from their resultant polyols.  In addition, the presence of secondary hydroxyls were described as causing sweating,<br><br>
wherein the product appears to be wet and not fully cured, thus limiting the use of low cost renewable initiators such as glycerol.<br>
Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide both a formation method and a vegetable based polyol that solves one or more of the problems of the prior art, such as one of those described above.  In particular it would be desirable to provide a vegetable oil based (VOB) polyol that can be used to make flexible polyurethane foams in the absence of any other polyols.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A first aspect of the invention is a process to make a vegetable oil based polyol, the process comprising,<br>
i) mixing an initiator that is a polyol, polyamine, aminoalcohol or mixture thereof and a vegetable oil based (VOB) monomer having at least one of the formulae:<br><br><br>
where m, n, v, r, and s are integers and m is greater than 3, n greater than or equal to zero and m+n is from 11 to 19, v is greater than 3, r is greater than or equal to zero, s is greater than or equal to zero and v+r+s is from 10 to 18, and<br>
ii) heating the mixture to a reaction temperature, for a reaction time, while under a vacuum and in the presence of an amount of catalyst sufficient to form the vegetable oil based polyol.  It is understood that the initiator fails to contain an ester group that can transesterify under the reaction conditions.<br>
The method of the first aspect surprisingly may form a non-gelled polyol with sufficient hydroxyl functionality and molecular weight to form a flexible foam when reacted with a polyisocyanate. The process even though performed under vacuum may use initiators that would volatilize off relative quickly at the reaction temperature used to form the VOB polyol. The process, surprisingly, nakes novel non-gelled VOB polyols even when VOB monomers are present that have three hydroxyl groups.  Finally, it has seen surprisingly found that the process forms a unique VOB polyol, where all of the VOB monomer is reacted, but within ;he polyol there are some hydroxyl or amine groups of the Initiator that have not been reacted even though the amount )f VOB monomer is far in excess of the stoichiometric amount leeded to react therewith.<br>
i  second aspect of the invention is a process to make a regetable based polyol, the process comprising,<br>
i) heating, in the presence of a catalyst a vegetable oil based monomer having at least one of the formulae:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where m, n, v, r, s, a, b and c are integers and m is greater than 3, n greater than or equal to zero and m+n is from 11 to 19/ v is greater than 3, r is greater than or equal to zero, s is greater than or equal to zero and v+r+s is from 10 to 18, a is from 0 to 35, b is from 0 to 35 and c is from 0 to 35, so long as that all a's, b's and c's are essentially not all zero, at least a portion of A is A3 and (a+b+c)/(p+q+t) is greater than 0 to about 100 in the vegetable oil based polyol.<br>
The vegetable oil based polyols may be used in any applications that polyols are used. Examples include polyurethane applications of all types such as elastomers, coatings, adhesives, sealants, rigid foams and in particular flexible foams.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The vegetable based polyols of the present invention are made by reacting an initiator with a vegetable oil based (VOB) monomer. The initiator has at least one<br><br>
active hydrogen, which are reacted with the VOB monomer.  The initiator may be depicted by the formula:<br>
R(XH)P<br>
Where X is 0, N, or NH and p is 1 to 8.  In the formula, X may be the same or different.  The initiator therefore encompasses polyols, polyamines and aminoalcohols. R generally represents a linear, cyclic chain or combination thereof of alkane (C-C), alkene (C=C), ether (C-O-C) linkages or combinations thereof. The carbons within the aforementioned chain may be substituted with a methyl or ethyl group. Generally the molecular weight of the initiator is at most from 32 to about 2000.  Preferably, the molecular weight is at least about 50, more preferably at least about 60, most preferably at least about 90 to preferably at most about 1400, more preferably at most about 1200 and most preferably at most about 800.<br>
Exemplary polyol initiators include neopentylglycol; 1,2-propylene glycol; trimethylolpropane; pentaerythritol; sorbitol; sucrose; glycerol; alkanediols such as 1,6-hexanediol; 2,5-hexanediol; 1,4-butanediol; 1,4-cyclohexane diol; ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol; triethylene glycol; 9(l)-hydroxymethyloctadecanol, 1,4-bishydroxymethylcyclohexane; 8,8-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclot5/2/l,02,6]decene; Dimerol alcohol (36 carbon diol available from Henkel Corporation); hydrogenated bisphenol; 9,9(10,10)L<br>
bishydroxymethyloctadecanol; 1,2,6-hexanetriol; any of the aforementioned where at least one of the alcohol or amine groups present therein has been reacted with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixture thereof; and combination thereof.<br>
Any of the aforementioned where at least one of the alcohol groups present therein has been reacted with ethylene oxide or propylene oxide means the active hydrogen of the<br><br>
hydroxyl reacts to form a polyether polyol exemplified by the following formula:<br><br>
where R is the same as defined above. It is also understood that the other alkoxylating agents instead of ethylene oxide or propylene oxide may be. Amine groups may also be reacted with the alkoxylating agent.<br>
Exemplary polyamine initiators include ethylene diamine; neopentyldiamine, 1,6-diaminohexane; bisaminomethyltricyclodecane; bisaminocyclohexane; diethylene triamine; bis-3-aminopropyl methylamine; and triethylene tetramine.<br>
Exemplary aminoalcohols include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine.<br>
Other useful initiators that may be used include polyols, polyamines or aminoalcohols described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,216f344; 4,243,818 and 4,348,543 and British Pat, No. 1,043,507.<br>
Preferably, the initiator is selected from the group consisting of neopentylglycol; trimethylolpropane; pentaerythritol; sorbitol; sucrose; glycerol; 1,2-propylene glycol; 1,6-hexanediol; 2,5-hexanediol; 1,6-hexanediol; 1,4-cyclohexane diol; 1,4-butanediol; ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol; triethylene glycol; bis-3-aminopropyl methylamine; ethylene diamine; diethylene triamine; 9(1)-hydroxymethyloctadecanol; 1,4-bishydroxymethylcyclohexane; 8, 8-bis (hydroxymethyl) tricyclo [5,2,1, 02'6] decene; Dimerol alcohol; hydrogenated bisphenol; 9,9(10,10)-bishydroxymethyloctadecanol; 1,2,6-hexanetriol; any of the aforementioned where at least one of the alcohol or amine jroups present therein has been reacted with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixture thereof; and combination thereof.<br><br>
More preferably the initiator is selected from the group consisting of neopentylglycol; 1,2-propylene glycol; trimethylolpropane; pentaerythritol; ethoxylated pentaerythritol; propoxylated pentaerythritol; sorbitol; sucrose; glycerol; ethoxylated glycerol; propoxylated glycerol; diethanolamine; alkanediols such as 1,6-hexanediol, 1,4-butanediol; 1,4-cyclohexane diol; 2,5-hexanediol; ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol; bis-3-aminopropyl methylamine; ethylene diamine; diethylene triamine; 9(1)-hydroxymethyloctadecanol, 1,4-bishydroxymethylcyclohexane; 8,8-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)tricyclo[5/2/l/02'6]decene; Dimerol alcohol; hydrogenated bisphenol; 9,9(10,10)-bishydroxymethyloctadecanol; 1,2,6-hexanetriol and combination thereof.<br>
Even more preferably the initiator is selected from the group consisting of glycerol; ethylene glycol; 1,2-propylene glycol; trimethylolpropane; ethylene diamine; pentaerythritol; diethylene triamine; sorbitol; sucrose; or any of the aforementioned where at least one of the alcohol or amine groups present therein has been reacted with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide or mixture thereof; and combination thereof.<br>
Most preferably the initiator is glycerol, pentaerythritol, sucrose, sorbitol, an ethoxylated glycerol, propyxylated glycerol, ethoxylated pentaerthritol, propyxylated pentaerthritol or mixture thereof.<br>
Surprisingly, using the method of the present invention, it is preferred that an initiator is used that has at least one secondary hydroxyl or secondary amine (e.g., glycerol).  It is surprising, because the reaction may cause the VOB monomer to react, for example with glycerol, in such a way that the resultant vegetable oil based polyol has at least some polyol molecules where at least one of the primary hydroxyls of the glycerol has not reacted with the VOB<br><br>
monomer, but the secondary hydroxyl has.  This is further described below.<br>
The VOB monomer is a vegetable oil based monomer having at least one of the formulae:<br><br>
where m, n, v, r, and s are integers and m is greater than 3, n greater than or equal to zero and m+n is from 11 to 19, v is greater than 3, r is greater than or equal to zero, s is greater than or equal to zero and v+r+s is from 10 to 18.<br>
The VOB monomer may be of any animal fat or vegetable oil that is comprised of triglycerides that upon saponification with a base such as aqueous sodium hydroxide yields a fatty acid and glycerol, where at least a portion of the fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids (i.e., contain at least one carbon double bond) .  Preferred vegetable oils are those that yield at least about 70 percent unsaturated fatty acids by weight. More preferably, the vegetable oil yields at least about 85 percent, more preferably at least 87 percent, and most preferably at least about 90 percent by<br><br>
weignt unsaturated fatty acids. It is understood that specific fatty acids derived from a vegetable oil, animal fat or any other source may be used. That is to say, for example, palmitoleic, oleic, linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic fatty acid alkyl esters may be used to form the VOB monomer directly.  It is preferred, however, to use a vegetable oil as previously described. Preferred vegetable oils include, for example/ soy, safflower, cotton, linseed, peanut, olive, sunflower, canola, rapeseed, corn, palm oil or combination thereof. More preferably, the vegetable oil is a soy, sunflower, canola, corn, rapeseed oil, or combination thereof. Most preferably, the vegetable oil is soy, sunflower, canola oil or combination thereof. It is understood that the vegetable oil may be obtained from a genetically modified organism, such as genetically modified<br>
soybean, sunflower or canola.<br>
t<br>
The unsaturated fatty acid alkyl esters then may be formed, by any suitable process such as those known in the art, into the VOB monomer (hydroxymethylesters) .  For example, the hydroxymethyl group may be introduced by a hydroformylation process using a cobalt or rhodium catalyst followed by the hydrogenation of the formyl group to obtain the hydroxymethyl group by catalytic or by chemical reduction.  Procedures to form the hydroxymethylesters are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,216,343; 4,216,344; 4,304,945 and 4,229,562 and in particular 4,083,816. Other known processes to form hydroxymethylesters from fatty acids may also be used such as described by U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,332,849 and 3,787,459.<br>
In forming the VOB monomers, the formylated fatty acid alkyl esters may be completely formylated or only partially formylated. That is to say, the fatty acid alkyl esters of the particular vegetable oil may have some remaining unsaturated (C=C) bonds.  Preferably, however, the amount of unsaturated bonds remaining after formylation is as<br><br>
described in concurrently filed application titled ^ALDEHYDE AND ALCOHOL COMPOSITIONS DERIVED FROM SEED OILS," having inventors Donald Morrison et al., attorney docket number 63104, and US Provisional Application No. 60/465,663, filed ' April 25, 2003 and concurrently filed non-provisional application claiming priority therefrom, incorporated herein by reference. After the fatty acid alkyl esters are formylated they are hydrogenated, such that there is desirably essentially no remaining unsaturated bonds (i.e., trace amounts at most and preferably no detectable amounts of unsaturation) .<br>
The VOB monomer and the initiator are mixed or blended together by any suitable means such as those known in the art.  For example, simple stirring is sufficient.<br>
The VOB monomer and initiator are heated to a reaction temperature, for a reaction time, while under a vacuum and in the presence of an amount of a catalyst sufficient to form the vegetable based polyol.  The reaction temperature that is employed is, for example, a function of the VOB monomer, initiator and catalyst, but the reaction<br>
temperature is generally at least about 140°C to about 300°C when using a tin or titanium catalyst.  Preferably, the reaction temperature is at least about 150°C, more preferably at least about 180°C, most preferably at least about 190°C to preferably at most about 250°C, more preferably at most about 220°C and most preferably at most about 210°C.<br>
The catalyst may be any suitable catalyst such as a tin, titanium, enzyme catalyst (e.g., lipase), carbonate catalyst (e.g., K2CO3, NaHC03) or combination thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst is an enzyme catalyst, such as lipase, which allows the reaction temperature to be below about 100°C to about room temperature. This in turn allows the use of initiators (e.g., sugar) that<br><br>
would be degraded by the higher temperatures using tin or titanium catalysts.<br>
The reaction time, similarly, is dependent on the variables described above for the reaction temperature. Generally, the time is at least about 10 minutes to at most about 24 hours.  Preferably, the reaction time is at least about 15 minutes, more preferably at least about 30 minutes, more preferably at least about 1 hour to preferably at most about 12 hours, more preferably at most about 9 hours and most preferably at most about 5 hours*<br>
To form the VOB polyol, it has been found that it is critical that the reaction be carried out under a vacuum. This is even true where the initiator is volatile at the reaction temperature. Volatile means that the initiator will volatilize off entirely in substantially less time than the total reaction time under the vacuum. For example, when the initiator is glycerol, the glycerol in the reaction vessel minus the VOB monomer would be volatilized off under a vacuum<br>
of about 20 torr in about 120 minutes at 200°C.  Generally, the vacuum is at least about 100 torr.  Preferably the vacuum is at least about 50 torr, more preferably the vacuum is at least about 20 torr.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, particularly when using a volatile initiator, the VOB is placed in the reactor under vacuum at the reaction temperature for a period of time sufficient to transesterify a substantial amount of the VOB monomer (e.g., at least about 10 percent of the ester groups of the VOB monomer have undergone transesterification) and subsequently the initiator is added to form the VOB polyol. This method allows for precise control of the molecular weight without substantial loss of a volatile initiator.<br>
The amount of catalyst has also been found to be critical when using a tin or titanium catalyst solely.  This is particularly true when the initiator is volatile as<br><br>
described previously. The amount of catalyst must be some minimum amount to effect the reaction between the initiator and VOB monomer sufficiently quickly to realize the VOB polyol.  The amount of catalyst depends, for example, on the particular type of catalyst, VOB monomer, and initiator.<br>
Generally, when a tin catalyst is employed, the amount of catalyst is at least about 100 ppm to at most about '2500 ppm by weight of tin to the total reaction mixture. Preferably, the amount of tin catalyst is at least about 250 ppm, more preferably at least about 500 ppm and most preferably at least about 1000 ppm to preferably at most about 2000 ppm, more preferably at most about 1500 ppm.  The tin catalyst may be any suitable tin catalyst such as those known in the art. Exemplary tin catalysts include tin (II) octanoate, tin (II) 2-ethylheptanoate, dibutyl tin (IV) dilaurate, and other tin catalysts which are similarly functionalized. Preferably the tin catalyst is tin (II) octanoate, tin (II) 2-ethylheptanoate, dibutyl tin (IV) dilaurate or combination thereof.<br>
Generally, when a titanium catalyst is employed, the amount of catalyst is at least about 100 ppm to at most about 2500 ppm by weight of titanium to the total reaction mixture.  Preferably, the amount of titanium catalyst is at least about 250 ppm, more preferably at least about 500 ppm and most preferably at least about 1000 ppm to preferably at most about 2000 ppm, more preferably at most about 1500 ppm. The titanium catalyst may be any suitable such as those known in the art.  Exemplary titanium catalysts include titanium tetraisopropoxide, titanium tetraisobutoxide, or any appropriately functionalized titanium (IV) alkoxide. Preferably the titanium catalyst is titanium tetraisopropoxide.<br>
The ratio of VOB monomer to initiator reactive groups is typically at least a stoichiometric amount (i.e., if the initiator is 1 mole of glycerol, the amount of VOB<br><br>
monomer is at least 3 moles) to at most about 100. Preferably the ratio of VOB monomer to initiator reactive groups is at least 2, more preferably at least about 5, even more preferably at least about 7 and most preferably at least about 10/ to preferably at most about 50, more preferably at most about 25, and most preferably at most about 20.  It has been surprisingly found when using these higher ratios even when reacting with a VOB monomer having multiple hydroxy group monomers therein a VOB polyol may be formed that is non-gelled and even a liquid.<br>
When employing the method of the present invention,<br>
it has been surprisingly discovered that a VOB polyol may be<br>
formed that has at least a portion of the polyol being<br>
comprised of a polyol molecule that has at least one<br>
initiator reactive group that is unreacted even while the VOB<br>
polyol as a whole has a VOB monomer to initiator reactive<br>
site ratio of at least 5. That is to say, the VOB polyol is<br>
comprised of	/<br><br>
where<br>
R is a residue of a polyol, polyamine or aminoalcohol initiator;<br>
X and X7 may be the same or different and is O, N or NH; p is an integer from 1 to 5; g is an integer from 1 to 5 wherein p + q is from 3 to 8, t is an integer from 3 to 8 and A may be the same or different and is selected from the group consisting of Al, A2 and A3 where<br><br><br><br>
hydroxyl functionality while achieving a sufficient molecular weight for use to make, for example, flexible polyurethane foams using the VOB polyol as the sole polyol reacted with an isocyanate to form the polyurethane foam. Preferably, the amount of the A3 constituent in the VOB polyol is at least about 0.01 weight percent of the total VOB polyol, more preferably the amount is at least about 0.02 weight percent, most preferably at least about 0.05 weight percent to preferably at most about 25 weight percent, more preferably at most about 20 weight percent and most preferably at most about 10 weight percent of the VOB polyol.<br>
When the VOB polyol contains A3, (a+b+c)/(p+q+t) is greater than 0 to about 100.  Preferably, (a+b+c) / (p+q+t) is at least about 0.25, more preferably at least about 0.5, most preferably at least about 1, to preferably at most about 50, more preferably at most about 25 and most preferably at most about 20.<br>
In another preferred embodiment when employing an initiator having, for example, a secondary hydroxyl or amine, the VOB polyol may have a portion of the VOB polyol that has a structure <br>
where at least one X'-H group is a primary hydroxyl or primary amine and at least one X-A-H is located at a position corresponding to a secondary hydroxyl or secondary amine of the initiator.  Preferably, the VOB polyol is at least partially comprised of the above structure where all of the X'-H groups are a primary hydroxyl or primary amine and all of the X-A-H groups are located at a position corresponding to a secondary hydroxyl or secondary amine of the initiator.<br>
The VOB polyol may be used to make polyurethanes by reacting it with a polyisocyanate such as those known in the<br><br>
art using known methods to make such polyurethanes. Preferably the polyurethane is a flexible foam.  More preferably the polyurethane is a flexible foam that has been formed by reacting the VOB polyol with a polyisocyanate in the absence of any other polyol.  That is to say the VOB polyol is the sole polyol that is used to make the flexible foam.<br>
Generally the VOB polyol may have a weight average molecular weight of about 350 to about 10,000.  Preferably the weight average molecular weight is at least about 500, more preferably at least about 1000 and most preferably at least about 1200 to preferably at most about 10,000, more preferably at most about 6000 and most preferably at most about 3000.  It is preferred that the VOB polyol is a liquid and surprisingly the method employed is capable of making high molecular weight polyols without gellation.<br>
VOB polyols of the invention may be used with any of the additives commonly known in the art for the production of polyurethane polymers. Any of a range of additives such as blowing agents, catalysts, surfactants, cell openers, colorants, fillers, load bearing enhancement additives such as copolymer polyols, water, internal mold releases, antistatic agents, antimicrobial agents, and other additives known to those skilled in the art are useful within the scope of the invention.<br>
While the full range of surfactants which are typically used in the formation of polyurethane foams are useful, certain surfactants,are preferred for foams which have high percentages of vegetable based polyols as the polyol component of the foam formulation.  In particular, in the formation of flexible slabstock foam, high efficiency alkoxylsilane surfactants such as those commonly used in specialty grades of flexible foam such as low-resiliency or wvisco-elasticff foam are unexpectedly found to greatly enhance the properties of flexible slabstock foams made when<br><br>
100 percent of the polyol side of the foam is made from VOB polyol.  Surfactants which are preferred are those such as L626 available from Crompton Corporation or other polyol pendant chains grafted with a silicone moiety.  Property enhancements are observed in properties such as foam cell size, cell structure, foam feel or whand, * which is defined as the aesthetic feel or tactile quality of the foam, that indicates its fineness, texture, and durability, and foam porosity.

General Procedure for the Production of Polyurethanes from Vegetable Oil-Based (VOB) Polyols<br>
All of the polyol components of a given formulation except the tin catalyst (stannous octanoate in dioctylphthalate, T-95), were individually metered and weighed into a one quart capacity metal cup. The contents were premixed for 15 seconds at 1800 rpm using a pin type<br><br>
mixer-  The tin catalyst, dispensed by volume, was then added to the stirred components and mixed for an additional 15 seconds at 1800 rpm. A stoichiometric amount of Toluene Diisocyanate (Voranate T-80), was then added to the cup and vigorously mixed for 3 seconds at 2400 rpm. The cup contents were then poured into a 15 "x 15 "x 10* wooden box lined with a polyethylene bag.  The blowoff time and any other distinct reaction characteristics were recorded. The foam buns were allowed to cure overnight under a ventilated fume hood.  They were then placed in ambient storage and submitted for physical property assessment using ASTM test method designation D 3574-95.<br>
Where indicated, other slabstock foam data were generated on conventional continuous machines (Polymech or TJBT) featuring a reciprocating mixing head and high pressure injection of all streams except the polyol.  The polyol and isocyanate temperatures were maintained at around 23°C.  The polyol output was 20 kg/min.  (The polyols used in Examples 34-36 and Examples 49-51 were blended with Voranol 3137A either in the polyol tank or in the mixing head.).<br>
According to the general procedure, the foams were prepared according to the following formulations, with the results of mechanical testing included in the tables:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Examples 58-62. Rigid Foams prepared from seed oil polyols General Procedure for the production of rigid foams;<br>
Foam components were measured to an appropriate total blended mass which was appropriate for the size of the container into which the foam will be formed, according to the ratios in the Table XVIII for Examples 58-62.  The isocyanate component was weighed into a mixing cup separately. All components except for the isocyanate were combined in a mixing cup and stirred at 1000 rpm for 6 seconds. The isocyanate was then added to the blend of all other components in the polyol, and this new mixture was blended at 1000 rpm for '6 seconds. The foam mixture was then<br><br>
poured into the container in which the foam was to be formed. The following characteristics were measured: gel-time which is defined as when a tongue depressor inserted into the foam draws strings when removed (not surface stringing but stringing from foam Interior), and tack free-time which is defined as when the foam surface is no longer tacky, or does not adhere to touch. Results of these Examples are shown in Table XVIII<br>
Table XVIII: Results of Examples 58-62<br><br>
Examples 63 and 64:  Elastomers and coatings prepared from vegetable oil-based polyol<br>
Polyols of the examples were blended together by adding molecular sieves (Baylith L) and mixing by hand for 5 minutes.- The blend is then degassed in a vacuum oven until no bubbles were retained.<br>
Method for production of an elastomer plate or a coating<br>
The polyol of the example and the isocyanate were mixed at room temperature for a minimum of 1 minute to achieve complete homogeneity. The resulting mixture was cast<br><br>
into a mold of 2mm thickness for preparation of an elastomer, or cast onto a flat surface for the preparation of a coating. Curing of a thin layer (2mm) at atmospheric condition gave a good elastomer without bubbles. Alternatively, the casting was cured in an oven for 1 hour at 75°C.<br>
The resulting polyurethane sample was kept at room temperature for 7 days before testing, or alternatively was post cured at 75°C 10 hours before testing.<br>
