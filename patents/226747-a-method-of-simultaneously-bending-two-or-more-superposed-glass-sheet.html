				<td>METHOD OP BENDING GLASS SHEETS BY PRESSING AND PARTIAL<br>
VACUUM<br>
The present invention relates to a method of bending a<br>
glass sheet or a stack of superposed glass sheets in a<br>
bending cell.<br>
The sheets to be bent, heated to the bending<br>
temperature in a horizontal oven through which they are<br>
carried by a conveyor are fed by the conveyor into the<br>
bending cell, in which there is a convex solid male former<br>
toward which the glass sheet is moved vertically by a<br>
concave annular female former, so as to be pressed between<br>
the male former and the female former.<br>
The resulting bent glass sheets are intended for such<br>
things as glazing for cars, especially windshields, the<br>
glazing being in most cases laminated, i.e. consisting of<br>
at least two sheets of glass laid one on top of the other<br>
with a sheet of a plastic material such as poly(vinyl<br>
butyral) (PVB) between them.<br>
Bent forms for car glazing are in great demand, the<br>
bending being defined in a first approach by one radius of<br>
curvature of a line in one direction of the glazing and by<br>
a second radius of curvature of a line in another direction<br>
of the glazing, the second line being perpendicular to the<br>
first. To give a general idea, the first radius of<br>
curvature may be from one meter to infinity and the second<br>
radius of curvature from five meters to infinity. Ever more<br>
pronounced curvatures in at least one of the two dimensions<br>
of the sheet are now demanded.<br>
When producing single glazing, the glass sheets to be<br>
bent are introduced individually into the bending cell.<br>
When producing laminated glazing, the number of glass<br>
sheets which the laminated glazing is to have (usually two)<br>
are laid one on top of the other, with a separating agent,<br>
such as calcium carbonate powder or kieselguhr powder,<br>
between them, and this stack is fed into the entrance of<br>
the oven. This makes it possible to achieve perfectly<br><br><br>
matching shapes in the case of glass sheets intended to be<br>
brought together in a single laminated glazing sheet. The<br>
bent sheets produced in this way are separated by hand,<br>
after cooling, before being joined together using the<br>
intermediate sheets of PVB-type (polyvinylbutyral) plastic.<br>
Car makers demand the production of glazing with<br>
complex shapes, especially with high developability<br>
coefficients, and this with very good geometrical<br>
tolerances, in other words departing very little (less than<br>
2 mm or even less than 1 mm) from the intended shape. What<br>
is more, the glazing must have as little marking as<br>
possible from the bending tools, especially in the central<br>
area. Finally, when the glazing comprises at least one<br>
layer such as a sun screening layer, e.g. a layer<br>
comprising silver, the bending process must not damage the<br>
layer(s).<br>
In this text, the term "deflection" means the depth of<br>
bend of the longest arc, which usually corresponds to the<br>
most pronounced bend. This corresponds to the line segment<br>
whose ends are on the center of said arc and on the center<br>
of the chord of this arc (see in particular the deflection<br>
F as shown in figure 7). The secondary bend, known as the<br>
"cross bend" or "cross curvature" is perpendicular to the<br>
first bend, and is generally less pronounced than the first<br>
bend. "Cross bend" also refers to the depth of this<br>
secondary bend formed by the arc perpendicular to the<br>
longest arc and corresponds to the line segment whose ends<br>
are on the center of said arc and on the center of the<br>
chord of this arc (see in particular the cross bend DB as<br>
shown in figure 7).<br>
The term "skeleton" refers to a narrow strip of metal<br>
closed around on itself to form a support, on the narrow<br>
upper edge of which a glass sheet is laid (see figure 8a).<br>
The thickness of the narrow edge is generally from 0.1 to<br>
1 cm. In the context of the present application, a skeleton<br>
supports a glass sheet in such a way that the narrow edge<br>
of the glass sheet is at least 2 cm and generally from 2 to<br><br><br>
10 cm away from said skeleton. This prevents the "bathtub"<br>
sagging effect which would occur if the support were too<br>
close to the edge of the glass.<br>
The term "frame" refers to a strip that is similarly<br>
closed around on itself but offers as a supporting surface<br>
not its narrow edge but one of its large surfaces (see<br>
figure 8b), the width of which is generally between 1 and<br>
4 cm. Generally speaking, a frame supports a glass sheet by<br>
supporting it at its periphery, including under the narrow<br>
edge of said sheet.<br>
In the context of the present application, the term<br>
glazing may cover an individual glass sheet or a plurality<br>
of superposed glass sheets.<br>
WO 95/01938 discloses a method of bending in a bending<br>
cell containing, as can be seen in figure 1 in the appended<br>
drawing:<br>
a support member consisting of a hot air cushion 1;<br>
above, the convex male former 2 equipped with means<br>
for holding a glass sheet or several superposed glass<br>
sheets 3 (two of these sheets being shown in figure 1)<br>
in contact with itself; and<br>
below, the concave annular female former 4, which can<br>
be moved between a low position below the plane of<br>
conveyance of the glass sheets 3 and a high position<br>
close to the male former 2. This female former 4, also<br>
referred to in this description as a "frame", is a<br>
metal structure that offers a greater surface area of<br>
contact with the glass sheet 3 than a single linear<br>
contact (as happens with a skeleton).<br>
In the method of WO 95/01938 the sheets 3 are fed by<br>
the rollers 5 into the bending cell and released onto the<br>
hot air cushion 1 (fig. 1A). As soon as the glass 3 is<br>
correctly positioned, the annular frame 4 is raised. As it<br>
rises, the glass 3 sags through the annular frame 4 due to<br>
gravity (fig. IB). As soon as the annular frame 4 has<br>
finished rising and the bend has thus begun to be formed,<br>
the glass sheet 3 or stack of glass sheets 3 comes under a<br><br>
4<br>
partial vacuum. The glass 3 therefore detaches completely<br>
from the annular frame 4 and clings to the convex surface<br>
of the male former 2 (fig. IC). The last step in this known<br>
bending process is a pressing operation between the male<br>
former 2 and the annular frame 4 of the glass sheet 3 or<br>
stack of glass sheets 3. This pressing is simply a<br>
finishing step intended to finish the geometry of the<br>
edges, without creating compression stresses in order<br>
evenly to distribute the excess material (fig. ID).<br>
This known process has been found not to be able to<br>
produce highly bent sheets, especially when several sheets<br>
are stacked together, because for curvatures with short<br>
radii it is no longer possible to prevent the edges of the<br>
glass sheet wrinkling, and so causing optical defects. This<br>
happens particularly with forms of glazing that have a<br>
coefficient of non-developability locally greater than 2<br>
(especially in the case of several superposed sheets), said<br>
coefficient of non-developability being defined by the<br>
formula D = Ln (107/R1 x R2) where Ln is the natural<br>
logarithm, and R1 and R2 are the main radii of curvature at<br>
the point considered, expressed in millimeters. Moreover,<br>
experience has shown that in the case in which several<br>
sheets are stacked (to make laminated glazing), not all the<br>
sheets can be held by the vacuum properly and they separate<br>
during the partial vacuum step, as those sheets which are<br>
not in contact with the male former are very likely not to<br>
follow the sheet placed in direct contact with the former.<br>
This results in disturbances necessitating production line<br>
stoppages.<br>
Equally, this known process demands large volumes of<br>
air, both during the partial vacuum phase (fig. 1C), and<br>
also because of the use of an air cushion. It should be<br>
understood too that the air cushion cannot be used to push<br>
the glass toward the convex upper former, its only use<br>
being to keep the sheets at a fixed distance (generally 2<br>
to 6 mm) from a component from which the air of said<br>
cushion is blowing.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve<br>
these problems. In particular, the method according to the<br>
invention is a short-duration bending method capable of<br>
producing deep concavities, for producing both deflection<br>
and cross bend, more particularly for superposed sheets,<br>
and with a minimum or absence of marks. In addition it does<br>
not require the blowing of large volumes of air.<br>
It has thus been discovered that an initial sag,<br>
preferably of mainly cylindrical type that preferably<br>
creates a deflection approximately equal to the final<br>
deflection (the deflection imposed by the male convex<br>
former), followed by pressing the perimeter of the glazing<br>
to define the peripheral shape of the glass sheet (or stack<br>
of glass sheets), followed in turn by applying a partial<br>
vacuum to the central part of the glass while still<br>
maintaining the peripheral pressing, has the effect of<br>
causing the glass to flow while said partial vacuum is<br>
being applied in such a way as evenly to distribute the<br>
effects produced by the two bends creating orthogonal<br>
concavities, and this for what may be small radii<br>
(equivalent to deep curvatures), such as 80 to 200 mm, for<br>
example about 100 mm. Immediately before the outline of the<br>
sheet is pressed, the central part of the glazing comes<br>
into contact with the opposing part of the male former. It<br>
might be supposed that a single forming of the periphery of<br>
the sheet would be sufficient to give the glazing its<br>
desired shape. However, it has been found that during the<br>
pressing of the periphery of the glazing, defects appear in<br>
the central part of the glazing owing to a partial loss of<br>
contact with the male former in this area (resulting in the<br>
formation of "pockets" or "bubbles"). The partial vacuum<br>
solves this problem by forcing the glazing into perfect<br>
contact with the male former. The result is to give the<br>
glazing almost exactly the geometry of the convex former.<br>
It is thus possible to manufacture glazing to a very small<br>
manufacturing tolerance, meaning that its geometry departs<br><br><br>
very little (less than 2 mm error, or even less than 1 mm<br>
error) from the desired shape.<br>
In addition, if a stack of several sheets of glass<br>
undergoes bending by the method of the invention, the<br>
pressing of the periphery clamps together the edges of the<br>
mating glass sheets, even to the extent of sealing the<br>
space between said sheets at the periphery. As a<br>
consequence of this, the strength of the partial vacuum<br>
applied to the first sheet - the sheet intended to be<br>
placed against the male former - is communicated to the<br>
second sheet, and so on. This solves the problem of the<br>
poor grip on the sheet or sheets furthest from the male<br>
former when bending a stack of glass sheets for the<br>
purposes of producing laminated glazing. The pressing thus<br>
has two effects: in the first place it creates a peripheral<br>
seal between the sheet directly in contact with the male<br>
former, but also it additionally creates a peripheral seal<br>
between the individual glass sheets. This is why the<br>
application of a partial vacuum can result in a force that<br>
presses all of the glass sheets toward the male former, the<br>
force of the partial vacuum being as it were communicated<br>
from sheet to sheet. The formation of bubbles or pockets is<br>
thus not only eliminated between the male former and the<br>
glass sheet touching it, but. also between the individual<br>
sheets. As a result, all the glass sheets have exactly the<br>
same shape, and this shape is very close to the intended<br>
shape.<br>
In accordance with the invention, it is preferred not<br>
to begin to apply the partial vacuum until the first glass<br>
sheet is in contact with the male convex former, as its<br>
premature application would serve no purpose and it is not<br>
advisable to apply suction unnecessarily. Besides, it would<br>
cause movement of gases, and it is generally desirable to<br>
reduce these to a minimum inside the bending cell.<br>
The subject of the present invention is therefore<br>
firstly a method of bending at least one glass sheet (one<br>
glass sheet or a stack of glass sheets) by forming said<br><br>
sheet or said stack between a convex solid male former and<br>
a concave annular female frame or former, said male former<br>
being located above said female former with vertical<br>
movement of one with respect to the other being possible in<br>
a bending cell in which an ambient temperature identical or<br>
approximately identical to the bending temperature is<br>
preferably maintained, the glass sheet or stack of glass<br>
sheets, heated to the bending temperature in a horizontal<br>
oven through which it travels on a conveyor, being<br>
subjected to forming after first undergoing a gravity-<br>
induced sag, which method is characterized in that a<br>
gravity-induced sag is preferably introduced under<br>
conditions leading to or leading essentially to a<br>
deflection f approximately equal to the final deflection<br>
and in that, for the forming process, the central region of<br>
said sheet (3) or stack of sheets (3) is first placed in<br>
contact with the male former (2), the peripheral region of<br>
said sheet (3) or stack of sheets (3) is then pressed<br>
between the male former (2) and the female former, and said<br>
sheet or stack of sheets is then held by partial vacuum<br>
against the male former, during which time the pressing is<br>
continued.<br>
The expression "leading to or leading essentially to a<br>
deflection f" means that a deflection f is formed in one<br>
direction of the surface of the sheet, it being possible<br>
for a cross bend to be formed in the other direction also,<br>
though much smaller than the cross bend imposed during the<br>
pressing.<br>
Thus, the invention relates to a method of bending at<br>
least one glass sheet comprising<br>
■	a step of allowing the glass to sag under<br>
gravity; then<br>
■	placing the central region of said one or more<br>
sheets in contact with a male former by advancing a<br>
female former supporting said sheet toward said<br>
male former, said male former being located above<br><br><br>
said female former with vertical movement of one<br>
with respect to the other being possible in a<br>
bending cell;<br>
■	then a phase of pressing the glass in its<br>
peripheral region between the male former and the<br>
female former; then<br>
■	a phase of holding the glass against the male<br>
former by partial vacuum, pressing being continued;<br>
then<br>
■	discontinuing the pressing by separating the male<br>
former from the female former; and then<br>
■	a step of cooling the glass outside the bending<br>
cell.<br>
In the method of the invention, a sag is introduced<br>
that may produce a deflection f of from 20 mm to 4 00 mm for<br>
a final deflection of from 20 mm to 490 mm. This sag is<br>
preferably of the mainly cylindrical type. The adjective<br>
"cylindrical" means not that the form obtained is exactly<br>
cylindrical but more that the result is a concavity<br>
principally in one direction, as for a cylinder. Here, the<br>
sag is mainly cylindrical, i.e. a more pronounced concavity<br>
is obtained in one direction to create the deflection, and<br>
a less pronounced concavity in the direction perpendicular<br>
to the first direction (the cross bend). The intermediate<br>
deflection f created by this sag in the main direction<br>
corresponding to the deepest concavity represents<br>
preferably 80 to 100% of the deflection imposed by the male<br>
convex former. The cross bend created by this sag in the<br>
secondary direction corresponding to the shallower<br>
concavity varies from 10 to 150 mm and represents<br>
preferably 10 to 50% of the final cross bend. This sagging<br>
phase is relatively short and may last, in the case of two<br>
superposed sheets, from 2 to 10 min. This short, a period is<br>
highly favorable to maintaining the integrity of an<br>
optional sun-screening layer containing silver. A short sag<br>
time is also favorable to limiting the marking of the<br><br><br>
glazing by the tool supporting it while it sags, especially<br>
if a skeleton is used. The short sagging time results in a<br>
mainly cylindrical sag. If sagging were allowed to continue<br>
for longer, it would become more spherical in character (a<br>
more pronounced cross bend). The sag support is of course<br>
of a shape that leads to the desired cylindrical sag, in<br>
other words the long sides of the support are curved<br>
sufficiently to allow the two long edges of the glazing to<br>
sink sufficiently.<br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
glass sheet or stack of glass sheets is fed into the<br>
bending cell in a flat condition on a conveyor consisting<br>
of a flat bed of cylindrical rollers, the glass sheet or<br>
stack of glass sheets entering the bending cell and<br>
becoming motionless on a support means that supports its<br>
central part, this means being surrounded by the annular<br>
female former. The sag phase is then conducted entirely<br>
within the bending cell as the annular female former<br>
holding the sheet or stack of sheets rises, which allows<br>
the sag to occur through said female former. In this first<br>
embodiment the annular female former acts first as a sag<br>
support and then as a pressing means. It does not have to<br>
be covered with a fibrous material such as a felt or knit<br>
fabric, but this is not however ruled out.<br>
In a variant of this first embodiment, the glass sheet<br>
is fed into the bending cell on a shaking bed placed in a<br>
tunnel oven, said bed consisting of shaping rods (rollers<br>
with a sunken shape, sometimes known as "handlebars") in<br>
order to initiate the bent shape, by progressive sagging,<br>
to the sheet(s), the glass sheet or stack of glass sheets<br>
then entering the bending cell and becoming motionless on a<br>
support means that supports its central part, this means<br>
being surrounded by the annular female former. The sag<br>
phase then takes place in the bending cell as the annular<br>
female former holding the sheet or stack of sheets rises,<br>
which allows the sag to occur through said female former.<br><br><br>
The abovementioned support means is here generally an air<br>
cushion.<br>
In a second, particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
sag is introduced to the glass sheet or stack of glass<br>
sheets at least partly while it is being transported<br>
through a tunnel oven leading to the bending cell where the<br>
pressing step is to be performed, said sag being introduced<br>
at least partly on a sag support which in turn is being<br>
transported on a conveyor carriage which travels through<br>
the tunnel oven and becomes motionless in the bending cell<br>
over the vertically movable means, said means being<br>
surrounded by the annular female former, means being<br>
provided for discharging the carriage carrying said support<br>
once the latter is motionless, and means being provided for<br>
discharging the sag support once the glass sheet or stack<br>
of glass sheets is supported around its periphery by the<br>
annular female former.<br>
When the sag support is motionless in the bending<br>
cell, said support occupies an area inscribed entirely<br>
(seen from above) within the annular female former, in such<br>
a way that said support can pass through the latter when<br>
said annular female former rises toward the male former,<br>
carrying the sheet or stack of sheets with it as it goes.<br>
The sag support may be a solid, perforated or open-<br>
worked surface or a frame, but is advantageously a<br>
skeleton, the glass sheet 3 (or stack of glass sheets 3) to<br>
be transported being laid on the upper edge of the<br>
skeleton. The sag support is preferably covered with a<br>
fibrous material such as a felt or woven or knit fabric<br>
that is resistant to the bending temperatures (generally a<br>
refractory metal or ceramic). Various different "skeletons"<br>
can be used, depending among other things on the size of<br>
the deflection. For smaller deflections (less than, say,<br>
200 mm) it is generally possible to use a fixed (that is,<br>
not jointed) skeleton. For larger deflections (greater<br>
than, say, 200 mm) it is also generally possible to use a<br>
jointed skeleton such as that disclosed in EP 448 447 A. In<br><br><br>
this embodiment, the annular female former does not have to<br>
be covered with a fibrous material such as a felt or a<br>
woven or knit fabric resistant to the bending temperatures<br>
(generally a refractory metal or ceramic) but such a<br>
covering is also possible.<br>
The vertically mobile means advantageously is a<br>
vertical column capable of traveling up and down in the<br>
bending cell.<br>
In accordance with various particular embodiments of<br>
the method according to the present invention:<br>
pressing is applied for 0.1 to 10 seconds;<br>
the partial vacuum is produced by a pressure drop<br>
created through the male former;<br>
the partial vacuum is applied at the same time as the<br>
pressing;<br>
following application of the partial vacuum with<br>
maintenance of the pressing, the next step in the<br>
method is to remove the pressing while maintaining a<br>
partial vacuum, preferably also by means of a skirt<br>
around the male former during the time required to<br>
retrieve the bent sheet or stack of bent sheets on a<br>
cooling support such as a cooling skeleton or<br>
preferably a cooling frame;<br>
the bending is carried out at a temperature of less<br>
than or equal to 640°C, especially at a temperature of<br>
from 590 to 630°C; and<br>
in the case of a stack of glass sheets for making<br>
laminated glazing, several glass sheets are superposed<br>
with a separating powder such as calcium carbonate or<br>
kieselguhr interposed around the perimeter.<br>
In the case of two superposed glass sheets, generally<br>
between 2 min 10 sec and 8 min elapse between the moment<br>
when the sheets are laid on the sag support and the<br>
moment when the sheets leave the bending cell.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, during the<br>
separation of the male former from the female former, the<br><br><br>
glass remains in contact with the male former under the<br>
effect of a partial vacuum.<br>
The partial vacuum applied through the male convex<br>
former may be applied through the whole of its surface<br>
area. The partial vacuum is preferably applied in a<br>
peripheral region surrounding another more central region<br>
in which positive gas pressure is applied. In this case<br>
the strength of the partial vacuum is greater than that<br>
of the positive gas pressure, so that the sum effect is<br>
that a partial vacuum is applied to the upper sheet. If<br>
positive gas pressure is applied in the central region,<br>
the male convex former is provided with a fibrous<br>
material (felt, knit fabric or the like) allowing the air<br>
to pass sideways through said fibrous material, that is<br>
to say parallel to the contact surface. The positive gas<br>
pressure is thus sufficiently moderate for there to be no<br>
loss of contact between the upper glass sheet and the<br>
covered male convex former. This gentle positive gas<br>
pressure produces a very thin cushion of air that reduces<br>
the contact pressure between the upper sheet and the male<br>
convex former with its fibrous material, and this further<br>
reduces the risk of the glass being marked by the<br>
contact.<br>
Also preferably, a skirt surrounds the male convex<br>
former so that a partial vacuum can also be applied<br>
around the outside of the glazing adjacent to the narrow<br>
edge(s) of the glass sheet(s). Overall, the total partial<br>
vacuum applied (the sum of the partial vacuums applied<br>
through the convex former on the one hand, and through<br>
the skirt on the other) is enough to keep the glass<br>
sheets in contact with the male former when the female<br>
former is removed and is no longer in contact with the<br>
glass following the pressing phase. During the pressing<br>
phase, it is not essential to apply the partial vacuum<br>
through the skirt because the glass is held in contact by<br>
the female former. The main need for the partial vacuum<br>
through the skirt is when several glass sheets are<br><br><br>
superposed and the female former is lowered, so that the<br>
complete stack of glass sheets is maintained in contact<br>
with the male former. However, in practice it is also<br>
possible to run all the partial vacuums simultaneously<br>
(both through the skirt and through the male former).<br>
Thus, when several glass sheets are superposed and are<br>
being bent at the same time as each other, during the<br>
separation of the male former from the female former, the<br>
glass remains in contact with the male former under the<br>
effect of a partial vacuum which is preferably at least<br>
partly applied through a skirt surrounding the male<br>
former.<br>
Next, while the glass is in contact with the male<br>
former under the effect of a partial vacuum, a cooling<br>
support is brought under the glass, the partial vacuum is<br>
then stopped to allow the glass to rest on said cooling<br>
support, and said cooling support then takes the glass<br>
away for the cooling step.<br>
The present invention also relates to the application<br>
of the method as defined above to the production of<br>
glazing having locally a coefficient of non-<br>
developability greater than 2 or even greater than 3, or<br>
even greater than 4. Glazing with high coefficients of<br>
non-developability possibly exceeding 3 or even 4 include<br>
for example the rear windows of motor vehicles (which<br>
generally include a single sheet of toughened glass),<br>
while glazing with lower coefficients of non-<br>
developability which may nonetheless be greater than 2 or<br>
even greater than 3 and are often between 2 and 3 include<br>
for example laminated windshields (generally comprising<br>
two glass sheets) for motor vehicles.<br>
Lastly, the present invention relates to a bending<br>
system for carrying out the method as defined above with<br>
reference to the second embodiment, characterized in that<br>
it comprises:<br><br><br>
an oven, generally comprising among other things a<br>
horizontal part;<br>
-	inside the oven, a system for transporting the glass<br>
(glass sheet or sheets) placed on a sag support<br>
particularly of skeleton type, that can be carried on a<br>
carriage;<br>
-	a bending cell comprising a bending oven, having a means<br>
for receiving and immobilizing the glass-carrying sag<br>
supports transported by said transport system, a frame<br>
or annular female former surrounding said<br>
receiving/immobilizing means and a convex male former<br>
located above the annular female former, means being<br>
provided for discharging the carriages from the bending<br>
cell, means being provided for discharging the sag<br>
supports from the bending cell, and means being provided<br>
for moving vertically on the one hand the annular female<br>
former and on the other hand the means of receiving and<br>
immobilizing the sag supports and for controlling the<br>
speed of movement. These last means may be power screws<br>
located outside the thermally insulated chamber.<br>
The invention thus provides a bending system for<br>
carrying out the method according to the invention<br>
comprising an oven in which is a system for transporting<br>
the skeleton-supported glass that moves the skeleton(s) to<br>
a bending cell, said cell comprising a frame or annular<br>
female former, the skeleton occupying an area inscribed<br>
entirely, seen from above, within the annular female<br>
former, and a convex male former located above the annular<br>
female former, means being provided for discharging the<br>
skeleton(s) from the bending cell, means being provided for<br>
moving vertically on the one hand the annular female<br>
former, and said male former being provided with means<br>
capable of applying a partial vacuum through its convex<br>
surface.<br>
To explain the method of the present invention more<br>
clearly, several particular embodiments of it will now be<br><br><br>
described for indicative purposes, no limitation being<br>
implied, with reference to the appended drawing, in which:<br>
figure 1 is a schematic side view of the different<br>
steps (figures 1A to ID) of a method of forming a<br>
stack of two glass sheets as disclosed in<br>
WO 95/011938;<br>

oven that feeds glazing to a bending cell, in a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention;<br>

to 5G) of this second embodiment;<br>

and pressing are applied in this second embodiment;<br>
figure 7 illustrates on a motor vehicle windshield<br>
seen in perspective the so-called deflection and cross<br>
bend, the deflection F and the cross bend DB being<br>
shown on a motor vehicle windshield seen in<br>
perspective from its convex side; and<br>
figure 8 shows the so-called skeleton (fig. 8a) and<br>
frame (fig. 8b).<br>
The first embodiment of the method according to the<br>
present invention will now be described with reference to<br>
figures 2A to 2D, which show, by way of example, the<br>
bending of a stack of two glass sheets intended to form a<br>
laminated windshield. It goes without saying that a single<br>
glass sheet could be bent.<br>
Figure 2A : Delivery of the glass sheets<br>
The glass sheets 3 are heated to the bending<br>
temperature in a horizontal oven (tunnel oven) through<br>
which they are conveyed by a flat roller conveyor 5 which<br><br><br>
passes them into a bending cell identical to that described<br>
with reference to figure 1. In the present case the sheets<br>
3 are flat as shown in figure 2A. Inside the bending cell,<br>
the sheets 3 are deposited on an air cushion 1, just as in<br>
WO 95/01938.<br>
Figure 2B : Sagging<br>
The gravity-induced sagging of the sheets 3 is brought<br>
about in the same way as in WO 95/01938 with the difference<br>
however that it is sufficiently short to be mainly<br>
cylindrical and to give an intermediate deflection f<br>
approximately equal to the final deflection (cp. figure<br>
2C). Various parameters can be varied to produce the<br>
desired intermediate deflection f, as is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art, these parameters being the<br>
temperature and the dwell time.<br>
Figure 2C : Pressing<br>
After the glass has been allowed to sag through the<br>
annular frame 4, the frame is caused to continue its ascent<br>
toward the convex lower face of the male former 2 in order<br>
to press the periphery of the glass sheets 3.<br>
Figure 2D : Partial vacuum<br>
While the pressing is continued, the glass sheets 3<br>
are exposed to a negative pressure created through the male<br>
former. This partial vacuum must be sufficient for the<br>
whole surface of the upper glass sheet 3 to be in contact<br>
with the solid convex upper former 2. Before the glass<br>
contacts the upper male former, there is no detachment from<br>
the annular frame 4.<br>
After the application of the partial vacuum, as<br>
before, the glass sheets 3 are kept in contact with the<br>
male former 2 by the partial vacuum, particularly the<br>
additional partial vacuum through the skirt 16 and the<br>
lower sheet 3 cannot detach from the upper sheet 3 simply<br>
owing to the lowering of the female former 4. During or<br>
after of the lowering of the frame 4 beneath the plane of<br>
conveyance of the flat glass, a cooling support, such as a<br><br><br>
cooling frame is introduced underneath the male former to<br>
take the bent glass.<br>
As soon as the partial vacuum is discontinued, the<br>
bent sheets 3 fall onto said cooling support which<br>
positions itself on a conveyor in order to carry the bent<br>
sheets away to the cooling station. The cooling may be a<br>
quench (especially in the case of a single sheet) or<br>
natural cooling, which is the case with laminated<br>
windshields (at least two superposed sheets).<br>
In the method described above with reference Co figure<br>
2, the ways in which the glass is delivered (fig. 2A) and<br>
allowed to sag (fig. 2B) are not however preferred<br>
embodiments, although not ruled out of the present<br>
invention. Since the sag must preferably, in accordance<br>
with the present invention, be a mainly cylindrical sag<br>
leading to a deflection f approximately equal to the final<br>
deflection, then if the starting point is a flat piece of<br>
glass, it must be heated sufficiently.<br>
The preferred way of delivering glass sheets 3 will<br>
now be described with reference to figures 3 to 5. In this<br>
embodiment, the glass sheet or sheets 3 are delivered to<br>
the bending cell on skeletons 5' that are transported<br>
through the heating oven and on which the sag develops<br>
gradually and can be very advanced or even completed or<br>
nearly completed when the sheet 3 is placed in the bending<br>
cell in the pressing position according to the invention.<br>
In the case of superposed glass sheets, when<br>
transferring them to the bending cell, while the glass<br>
sheets are being heated, the different sheets may shift out<br>
of position with respect to each other. To avoid this, it<br>
is preferable to provide vertical stops connected to the<br>
lateral tabs 6, said stops holding the sheets in the<br>
correct position by the contact between the stops and the<br>
narrow edge of the sheets. This guides their sagging.<br>
The skeleton 5' has dimensions such that when the<br>
glass is placed on it, it is far enough from the edge of<br>
the glass sheet or sheets for the glass not to form a<br><br><br>
cavity that is too deep immediately adjacent to the<br>
periphery of the sheet (the "bathtub" effect) while it is<br>
being transported in the oven, but close enough to it for<br>
the desired sag effect and a main deflection to develop. To<br>
determine these characteristics of the sag skeleton 5' as a<br>
function of the other parameters of the installation is<br>
within the scope of those skilled in the art.<br>
As can be seen in figures 3 and 4, the skeleton 5' on<br>
which the sheet 3 is laid is carried by lateral tabs 6,<br>
which in turn are carried by a carriage 7 equipped with<br>
wheels 8 traveling on side rails 9 in the oven 10.<br>
In figure 3, reference number 11 indicates the walls<br>
of the oven, and 12 the position of the bending cell, in<br>
the lower part of which is a vertically movable vertical<br>
column 13 placed in the center of the frame 4 underneath<br>
the male former 2 (these parts 2 and 4 are not shown in<br>
figure 3), the function of the column 3 being described<br>
later. The carriage 7 is equipped with wheels 8 and tabs 6<br>
supporting the skeleton 5'. The wheels of the carriage are<br>
on the outside of the oven because the wheel axles pass<br>
through horizontal openings in the walls 11. To limit the<br>
heat losses through these openings, a refractory fabric<br>
(not shown) suspended from above can cover them, and moves<br>
away when pushed by the wheel axles, returning<br>
automatically to position once they have passed.<br>
When a skeleton 5' carrying a glazing 3 (one or more<br>
superposed sheets) that has developed the required sag<br>
arrives in the bending cell 12 (figure 5A), the carriage 7<br>
carrying it is stopped over the frame 4 and over the column<br>
13, which are in the down position.<br>
A signal is then given for the column 13 to rise so<br>
that it lifts up the skeleton 5' and its glazing 3 by a<br>
base plate 5'a forming part of said skeleton 5' and the<br>
carriage 7 advances to be returned to the entrance of the<br>
oven 10 (figure 5B). As the skeleton 5' is being raised by<br>
the column 13, it is recentered in the X and Y directions<br><br><br>
by a two-axis indexing system to place it in the exact<br>
position relative to the ring 4.<br>
The frame 4 is then caused to rise to support the<br>
periphery of the sheet 3, and the skeleton 5' discharged<br>
from the glass is withdrawn by the column 13 and discharged<br>
by a conveying system.<br>
At this point the pressing and partial-vacuum steps<br>
are applied (figures 5D and 5E, respectively). These are<br>
similar to the pressing and partial-vacuum steps of figures<br>
2C and 2D, respectively. Figure 6 shows a preferred variant<br>
in which a positive gas pressure is produced through the<br>
male former 2 toward the central part of the glass. The<br>
arrows in figure 6 indicate the direction of air movement.<br>
Here, the male former 2 is provided with an air-permeable<br>
fibrous material 15. The male former is provided with a<br>
skirt 16 through which a partial vacuum can be applied in<br>
order to keep the glass in contact with the male former 2<br>
even when the female former 4 is lowered.<br>
Next, as before, the frame 4 is lowered and the sheet<br>
3 is kept against the male former 2 by partial vacuum,<br>
particularly by the partial vacuum produced through a skirt<br>
16 in the case of a stack of sheets, while a discharging or<br>
cooling support 15 (generally a frame) takes the bent sheet<br>
3 away (figures 5F and 5G).<br>
The method described above can also be carried out<br>
with a fixed column that does not move vertically, while<br>
instead the tabs 6 move downward to deposit the sag support<br>
5' on the column.<br>
In the case of the prior art in which bent sheets are<br>
produced simply by allowing them to sag on the skeleton,<br>
the sheets are generally heated to as much as 640-660°C.<br>
The process furthermore includes attempting to heat the<br>
glass sheet to a greater extent in its central region in<br>
order not to give the sheet the shape of a "bathtub". What<br>
is more, in such a process it is very difficult if not<br>
impossible to produce a precise shape because of the lack<br>
of contact with a solid former.<br><br><br>
Standing in contrast to that, in the method as<br>
described with reference to figures 3 to 5, it is possible<br>
to work advantageously at a temperature of less than 640°C,<br>
for example at 590°C-640°C and even 590-630°C. The reason<br>
for this is that in the oven, and until pressing has begun<br>
(mechanical forming) there is no need to introduce the main<br>
concavity to obtain the deflection f. Nor is higher local<br>
heating of the glass sheet necessary. It is therefore<br>
heated evenly.<br>
The fact that the glass is worked at a lower bending<br>
temperature, without causing it to break, is advantageous<br>
both because it costs less and because there is less risk<br>
of modifying the optical, mechanical or other qualities of<br>
the glass. Also, when working with a stack of glass sheets<br>
separated by a separating powder (calcium carbonate,<br>
kieselguhr), there is little or no risk of said powder<br>
giving rise to pits or optical defects, especially as it is<br>
unnecessary, with the method of the present invention, to<br>
lay powder over the entire surface of the glass and as it<br>
only has to be placed around the perimeter. It may be<br>
observed that certain glass sheets, particularly those<br>
intended to form one of the sheets of a windshield, have a<br>
coat of black enamel around the periphery of one face. This<br>
sheet will be placed in the stack with its black enamel<br>
coat turned toward the inside, the separating powder then<br>
being placed on the black enamel. In this way, any optical<br>
defects that could occur due to the use of the powder will<br>
be completely hidden from view when the windshield is<br>
fitted to the vehicle.<br>
The use of an even temperature, which does not<br>
therefore introduce stresses into the glass, is very useful<br>
particularly in the case in which one sheet of a stack<br>
comprises, coated on one of its faces, a silver-rich sun-<br>
screening film. Such films are known to be liable to crack<br>
if heated unevenly.<br>
Types of stacks that can thus be mentioned for forming<br>
windshields include conventional stacks having a lower<br><br><br>
sheet with a peripheral film of enamel on the inside and an<br>
upper sheet completely covered with a sun-screen film also<br>
on the inside. The bending of such stacks with the<br>
application of the separating powder around the periphery-<br>
only is, with the means of the invention, carried out in<br>
the best possible manner. The assembly of a laminated<br>
windshield with an interposed plastic (PVB) sheet will be<br>
carried out in the conventional way with the two sheets<br>
resulting from the same bending operation, after natural<br>
cooling at a rate of for example 10°C/second.<br>
Moreover, instead of performing the bending entirely<br>
on a skeleton (cooling included), the bent sheets are<br>
cooled, with the present invention, more satisfactorily. In<br>
the first case the skeleton is in direct contact with the<br>
glass from the very beginning of the process. Being<br>
metallic, the skeleton cools down faster than the glass, so<br>
that extension stresses develop within the glass, making it<br>
more fragile and giving rise to a reject rate that is not<br>
insignificant.<br>
In the case of the present invention, the cooling<br>
frame (which could be replaced by a cooling skeleton) is<br>
introduced only after the bending. It is preferably<br>
equipped with a knit fabric or felt to insulate the metal<br>
frame or skeleton from the glazing and allow air to pass<br>
through because of their incomplete contact with the glass.<br>
With the method according to the invention, and for<br>
the same production rate, the number of tools necessary is<br>
smaller, which helps to ensure closer identity between the<br>
manufactured parts. Thus, compared with bending on the<br>
skeleton (cooling included), three cooling frames are<br>
necessary with the invention instead of 30 to 40 skeletons.<br><br>
