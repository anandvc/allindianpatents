COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (Section 10)<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF A MOULD FOR MAKING COLD CURE FOAM PRODUCTS FACILITATING DEMOULDING WITHOUT USE OF A RELEASE AGENT.<br>
PULIN SHAH, I, Mekhia, Samarth Nagar Society, Off N.S. Mankikar Marg, B/H Canara Bank, Chunabhatti East, Mumbai 400 022, Maharashtra, INDIA, an Indian  National.<br>
Original<br>
The following specification particularly describes nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to the method of preparation of a mould for making cold<br>
cure foam products, which will allow release of molded Polyurethane part without the use<br>
of a release agent. Release agents are routinely used to prevent the foam products from<br>
sticking to the mould surface that is to act as a barrier between the foam products and the<br>
mould.<br>
Prior Art : Polyurethane are a mix of two components:   Isocyanates-comprising of<br>
Toluene di Isocyanate and/or Di-methelene-di-Isocyante having free NCO groups which<br>
reacts with hydroxile groups present in the Polyols.   Catalysts and Blowing agents are<br>
present within the polyol along with other additives. When reacted with NCO group they<br>
form a long chain, which is known as Polyurethane.<br>
Blowing agents, generally water is available in small quantities, which on reacting with-<br>
NCO group of ISO liberates Carbon dioxide, the librated CO2 forms micro cell in the <br>
rising foam.<br>
Amine catalysts, tin soaps, organic tin compounds are added to hasten the reactions. The<br>
blowing agents present in form of water or in liquefied gaseous state liberates at its<br>
boiling point due to exothermic reactivity.<br>
R1NCO + R2OH	â€” RlNHCOOR2<br>
The resultant mix while extending its chain incorporates liberated gas from the blowing agent and becomes viscous and micro-cellular and gradually achieves solid state. This mix thus formed starts to form long chain, which is popularly known as Gelling. The cross-linking action forms honeycomb like structure, radiating from the bottom of the mould to its outer walls. Once this solid state is achieved and the resultant mix starts to condense, a sticky skin like outer covering is formed. This sticky outer skin sticks to the surface of the mould. To prevent this sticking of the resultant Polyurethane foam to the mould surface release agents are used. The release agents are generally wax or silicon suspended in aromatic solutions hence on application of the release agent to the mould surface, the medium evaporates on contact leaving behind a very fine Patina of wax or silicon on the mould surface.<br><br>
This Patina adheres to the poured foam and releases itself from the mould.  The release agent wears off from the mould surface and hence the need for re-applying release agent. Existing technology includes the following:<br>
(1)	A fine spray of silicon/wax suspended in aromatic compounds like benzene-Toluene etc is applied to the mould surface, the solution on spraying becomes exposed to the atmosphere and the solvent evaporates leaving a fine non-permeable layer of wax or silicon on the mould surface. In this instance the layer gets disrupted as the Polyurethane foam on rising sticks to the thin layer of wax/silicon spray and on remolding releases itself from the mould along with the release agent film. This release agent has to be applied after every shot. Data sheet attached.<br>
(2)	Italian furniture manufacturers have made a silicon paste which is brush applied to the mould surface, which does not allow the adhesion of Polyurethane foam to the mould surface. However, this layer of dried silicon, which acts as a barrier perishes due to wear and tear. The paste has to be reapplied once in 20-40 shots, which is both expensive and labour intensive.<br>
In both the cases it is seen that the release agent has to be continuously reapplied which is<br>
a cost, and slows down the productivity. Furthermore, when the solvent evaporates on<br>
spraying of the release agent, the solvent is released into the atmosphere and causes<br>
environmental pollution.	<br>
The aforementioned methods are the traditional methods adopted in the industry wherein the polyurethane product, when formed will stick to the mould surface, and the problem of constantly applying the release medium to the mould surface persists. The need of the hour is to develop a release medium, which instead of sticking to the foam, should adhere to the mould surface and release itself from the foam, then there will be no need to re-apply the release agent. Alternatively, the need is to develop a mould such that the surface of the mould is joint less and glossy to prevent the formation of the micro cells, as the adhesion of the foam to the surface is basically due to the micro-<br><br>
porosity of the cavity material and the cross linking property of the chemical mix. It is proposed to use such mold to make polyurethane moldings.<br>
Cost  efficiency  in  terms  of value of release agent  and  productivity  improves considerably. This invention seeks to do away with the old method of manufacture. Accordingly, this invention relates to a method for manufacture of a mould to produce cold cure foam products, without the use of a release agent.<br>
The primary aim of this invention is to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks found in the current methods of manufacture.<br>
It is also the object of this invention to offer a better method of manufacture which will not pollute the environment, as tons of release agents used in the current methods can be done away with completely and cost of ultimate molded product will come down considerably.<br>
Accordingly, this invention provides for a method of manufacture of a mould for cold cure foam products by using Polyolefm powder as a base material for making release agent free moulds wherein the surface is joint less and glossy which will prevent the formation of micro-cells which encourages sticking. Such surfaces cannot be machined but are manufactured. Polyolefm derivates like Polypropelene (PP), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Ultra High Molecular Weight High Density Polyethylene (UHMWHDPE), linear Low Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) etc. has the lowest coefficient of friction after Polytetraflouroethylene (PTFE). These are commercially available and are comparatively easier to handle in terms of their processing ability. Such powders are manufactured by almost all companies in the world and in India Reliance, IPCL also makes them. The physical properties of these commercially available powders are easily alterable to improve gloss and compaction.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A more complete appreciation of the present invention and many of its advantages will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings and detailed specification, all of which forms a part of the disclosure:<br>
Fig.l: shows the hollow metal box C in which the polyolefin powder is filled. This box C has ridges R on the sidewalls Wl and W2. Hinges H are placed at the juncture of the sidewalls Wl and W2 and the bottom of the metal box C.<br>

Fig.4: shows full compaction of the punch A over metal box C, packing the powder completely.<br>
Fig. 5: shows withdrawal of the punch A from the box C, opening the sidewalls Wl and W2 of the box C sideways by means of the hinges H.<br>
Fig 6: shows the solidified mould cavity with external rib projections, which is ready for metal braces.<br>
Fig. 7: shows the top plate D backed with metal webbing and braced with angles to allow fixing of hinges and clamps.<br><br><br>
Referring to the drawings, A Ultra High Molecular Weight High Density Polyethylene<br>
(UHMWHDPE) or Polypropylene â€” (PP) or High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) powder<br>
of suitable grade having particle size of 50 to 300 microns and molecular weight between<br>
200000 and 250000 is mixed with a chemical cross linker namely, Benzoyl peroxide<br>
thoroughly by hand or by dry tumbling in such a manner that the resultant mix forms a<br>
homogeneous mass.  The said cross linker is present in the said resultant roughly in the<br>
proportion 3 parts of the cross linker to one hundred parts of the powder. A metal box C<br>
is made of mild steel plates is fitted with electrical heater bands to impart equal heating<br>
from all sides.  The box C can also be heated by hot oil.   The box C has ridges R to<br>
accommodate the molten polyolefin derivative, which enables rib formation on the mould<br>
at various places for giving rigidity to the foam and for better heat dissipation. The box C<br>
is placed on a heated platen P to allow even heating from the bottom also.  A punch A<br>
which is in the actual shape of the product (plus shrinkage) to be produced, is made of<br>
Aluminum, Zinc or Steel and is highly polished, is heated by electricity or oil.   This<br>
punch A is fixed on to the platen B.  The box C along with the punch A are heated to<br>
glass transition temperatures between 200Â°C and 270Â°C.    The said mass is then<br>
transferred to the metal box C either manually or by a mechanical device and charged, the<br>
charge calculated from volume of the metal box C. The said mass fills the mould cavity<br>
by volume to ensure packing of material and prevent air embolism and spreads and fills<br>
the hollow spaces in the box C. The heated punch A is then slowdy lowered to compress<br>
the charged mass.   The mass is now evenly distributed between the punch A and the<br>
restraining box C. The punch A is lifted up once to release any air trapped in the cavity<br>
of the box C, to top up the said mass, if necessary, and is once more brought down to<br>
ensure that no air gap is left.  Once the mass is heated, compressed       and pressurized,<br>
the said mass reaches the Glass Transition Phase and flows and takes	the shape of<br>
the recess available the punch A and the restraining metal box C The punch A and the metal box C are then allowed to cool naturally to room temperature. On cooling the said mass solidifies in the shape of the recess provided between the punch A and the restraining metal box C.  The punch A is then lifted and side walls Wl and W2 are then<br><br>
forced open sideways to eject the whole mould cavity. The solidified body is then bolstered, if necessary, by fixing angles on all sides by screwing them by means of a plate D, which is made of polyolefin, backed with metal webbing and braced with angles. This is done to impart rigidity and strength to the mould. The finished cavity and punch joined by hinges and clamps is then mounted on a frame or a trolley for moulding cold cure foam wherein the use of a release agent is completely redundant,<br>

The metal box C along with punch A is heated  to 260o C and total powder i.e transferred into the box C The mess is then  charged and the weight of charge is 2kg. The punch A_is lowered gradually into the heated box C at the rate of 10 to 15 mm per 30 seconds to compress the charged mass. The said mass is now compressed within the recess provided between the punch A and the box C. The punch A is then slowly taken upwards to allow the air trapped in box C to escape and then immediately lowered and the said mass is once again compressed fully under 100 kg/cm pressure for about 20-30 minutes, till the said mass reaches Glass Transition Phase and flows. On allowing the metal box C and the punch A to cool down naturally, in about 4 hours the powder solidifies and acquires the shape provided between the punch A and the metal box C.<br>
The box is opened from three sides, that is, the punch A is lifted and the two side walls Wl and W2 are opened sideways by using force and the force applied is 1000kg/sq.cm. The mould is now ready for making cold cure foam products.</td>
