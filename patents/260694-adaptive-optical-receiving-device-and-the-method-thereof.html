				<td>ADAPTIVE OPTICAL RECEIVING DEVICE AND THE METHOD<br>
THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to an optical transmission system, especially to a hitless real-time adaptive optical receiving device and the method thereof in the optical transmission system.<br>
Background Art<br>
An optical transmission system uses an optical receiver to receive the service transmitted, such as the signal STM-16 and the signal STM-64, with the speed of 2488.320Mb/s and 9953.280Mb/s respectively. Generally, in SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) and WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) optical transmission systems, the working point of the receiver will not vary over time. When beginning to work, performance of the receiver can be set as optima according to the working state of the line. However, as time goes by, changes of other various factors will lead to the result that the receiving performance of the receiver is not optimal.<br>
The aging of a laser will make the working point of the laser vary over time, and lead to the change of the transmission performance, thus result in the deterioration of the eye pattern of the signal at the receiver.<br>
In SDH and WDM optical transmission system of long distance, because of variation of the attenuation of the line, aging of EDFA (erbium doped fiber amplifier), and increase/decrease of the number of the WDM channels, the optical power injected into optic fibre is different. Due to different optic fibre nonlinear effects, when the optical signal reaches the receiver, the received signal will change. The higher the modulation speed of the signal is, the greater the influence of this kind of optic fibre nonlinear effect is.<br>
In SDH and WDM optical transmission system of long distance, the aging of EDFA and the variation of the attenuation of the line will make the optical SNR of the signal at the receiver vary continuously.<br>
In the optical communication system with the speed of 10Gb/s or above, dispersion compensation device is often used to compensate the dispersion of line optic fibre. However, the dispersion of line optic fibre will vary slightly over time, and the residual dispersion at the receiver varies with time continuously, which will also bring about the variation of the signal at the receiver.<br>
In summary, these factors above illustrate that, as time goes by, quality of the signals arriving at the receiver after being transmitted on the line will vary constantly. For this kind of signals which vary constantly, how to receive adaptively is one of the key points in this art.<br>
In the existing optical transmission system, a receiver usually consists of an optical-electrical converter, an AGC (automatic gain control) amplifier, a limiting amplifier, a clock/data retiming circuit etc., and its construction is shown in figure 1. Although the decision level and the decision time of this kind of receiver can be optimized according to the original signal, they remain changeless during the course of working; or they can be optimized according to a simple control tactic, but if the tactic is not chosen suitably, bit error may occur during the optimization course.<br>
For the variation of the signal received, there are many methods for receiving adaptively. Currently, the method for receiving adaptively in common use is to perform feedback control for the receiver using FEC (Forward Error Correction), and thus to achieve adaptive receiving in real time. The block of the principle is shown in figure 2. The receiver can be controlled adaptively using FEC for detecting bit error rate. This kind of method in which the receiver detects the bit error using FEC optimizes continuously the decision level and decision time of the receiver to achieve adaptive receiving. For the adaptive receiving in this method, the optimization is performed for the signal being used currently. In order to ensure that the signal after FEC decoding has no bit error, the optimization tactic should be chosen carefully so that there are few bit errors before FEC during the optimization course; additionally, this kind of optimization method can only be performed under the condition of little bit error, and the time for optimizing is long. On the other hand, if the adaptive receiving is performed using FEC technique, the bandwidth of the receiver can not be optimized for different signals, and there is some limitation when using this technique.<br>
Optimizing only the decision level and the decision time of the receiver will lead to a<br>
wrong decision during the course of optimization, and thus result in unnecessary bit error. Additionally, there are many situations in which FEC is not used in current optical transmission systems. Therefore, a receiving method is required to adapt to the variation of the signal without any loss in real time in optical transmission systems.<br>

Specific Embodiment of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 is a structure block of a traditional optical receiver, wherein an input optical signal is converted into an electrical signal by an optical-electrical converter, then is amplified by a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA). In order to improve the dynamitic range of the receiver and prevent the amplitude of the output electrical signal from being too large when the input optical signal power is great, the gain of the amplifier can be reduced when the input optical signal power is great, and this is so-called AGC (automatic gain control). The amplified signal is amplified by LIA (limiting amplifier) which is an amplifier for limiting the output with greater gain, which means that a segment of the signal with less amplitude is shaped into code "1" or code "0" after being amplified, the DC working point of the LIA is changed, and thus the level for deciding the signal amplitude can be changed. The CDR (clock data recovery) circuit extracts the clock and the data for the signal of limiting output. The bias circuit is used to provide bias for DC working point of the optical-electrical converter, the input optical power detecting unit detects the input optical power. The control unit controls TIA and AGC amplifier, LIA, and CDR, thus can control the parameters such as the DC working point of LIA, the decision time of CDR, etc..<br>
Figure 2 is a block of a receiver using FEC technique to implement adaptive receiving, wherein a FEC bit error detecting unit is added to the existing receiver. Using FEC function to detect the bit error rate of the signal, this unit controls various parameters such as the gain of TIA and AGC amplifier, DC working point of LIA, and the decision time of CDR, etc..<br>
The key content of the invention is that, in order to achieve real-time optimization and to avoid bit error resulted from the optimization, two sets of dependant amplifiers and CDR circuits are used, and the hitless changeover unit chooses signals with good quality as the main signals to output; meanwhile, signals with bad quality are called standby signals, which<br>
are used for real-time optimization, and when quality of the main signal becomes worse, the hitless changeover unit performs the hitless switching between the main signal and the standby signal, with the main signal being replaced by the standby signal.<br>
In the following, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 3 is a structure block of the adaptive optical receiving device in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, which shows the condition without using a dynamitic filter.<br>
As shown in figure 3, an optical-electrical converting device is used in this embodiment, which converts the received optical signal into an electrical signal and then sent the converted signal to TIA and AGC amplifier for amplification, the amplified signal is sent to the two sets of separate LIA 1 and LIA 2, CDR circuit 1 and CDR circuit 2 to generate two groups of the same data signals, one of which is chosen by the hitless changeover unit as the main signal to be output to the post-stage circuit after passing through the DEMUX and signal quality detection circuit 1 and the DEMUX and signal quality detection circuit 2. The channel which is not chosen is taken as a standby channel. Meanwhile, under the control of the signal for detecting the signal quality of the control unit, the DEMUX and signal quality detection circuit 1 and the DEMUX and signal quality detection circuit 2 send the quality detection results of signal with bit error of the 2 channels respectively to the control unit, which controls the hitless changeover unit, LIA and CDR circuit. Meanwhile, the control unit controls the LIA in the standby channel and the CDR circuit to optimize the signals in this channel. When the signal quality in the standby channel is much better than that in the main channel, or the signal quality in the main channel decreases below the specified threshold and the signal quality after optimization in the standby channel is better than this threshold, the control unit controls the hitless changeover unit to perform the switch between the main channel and the standby channel using the changeover control signal.<br>
Wherein, the function of the bias circuit in figure 3 is similar to that of the bias circuit in a traditional receiver. The bias circuit is used to provide bias for the DC working point of the optical-electrical converter. Additionally, the functions of the TIA and AGC amplifier, LIA 1 and 2, CDR circuit 1 and 2 are the same as those of the TIA and AGC amplifier, LIA 1 and 2, CDR circuit 1 and 2 in a traditional receiver.<br>
Figure 4 is a structure block of the adaptive optical receiving device in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, which shows the condition of using a dynamitic filter.<br>
In this embodiment, the dynamitic filters 1 and 2 are added to the receiving device as illustrated in figure 3, which filter the signals from TIA and AGC amplifier, and then send the filtered signals of these two channels to the LIA 1 and 2. Wherein, the functions of the dynamitic filters 1 and 2 are the same as those of the dynamitic filters in the traditional receivers.<br>
Methods in figure 5 and figure 6 are optimized methods of adaptive optical receiving of the optical receiving devices shown in figure 3 and figure 4 respectively, wherein the case in figure 5 is for using no dynamitic filter, the case in figure 6 is for using a dynamitic filter. The steps of the methods in figure 5 and figure 6 are substantially the same, except for some configuration and control for the filter, thus the adaptive optical receiving method of the invention will be described combining figure 5 and figure 6 in the following.<br>
In steps 505, 605, at the beginning of working, parameters are preset for the dynamitic filter (figure 6), LIA, and CDR circuit. The hitless changeover unit is preset to select a channel. The channel selected by the hitless changeover unit is referred to as the main channel, and un-chosen channel is referred to as the standby channel. By way of example, provided the hitless changeover unit chooses channel 1 to output, now channel 1 is the main channel, and channel 2 is the standby channel, the initial values of the parameters of dynamitic filter 1 (figure 6), LIA 1, and CDR circuit 1 are preset by the control unit; the initial values of the parameters of dynamitic filter 2 (figure 6), LIA 2, and CDR circuit 2 are also preset by the control unit.<br>
In steps 510, 610, after presetting the parameters, the main channel is used to receive the optical signal and implement the signal processing whose function is the same as that of the traditional optical receiver, and to output the signal processed to the post-stage circuit.<br>
In steps 515, 615, when the main channel is working, the control unit monitors the signal quality of the main channel and the standby channel.<br>
In steps 520, 620, the control unit optimizes the dynamitic filter (figure 6), LIA 2, and CDR circuit 2 of the standby channel, i.e. channel 2, according to the detected signal quality<br>
of the standby channel, and makes the signal quality of the standby channel the best.<br>
In steps 525, 625, the control unit continuously compares the signal quality of the main channel with that of the standby channel. If the control unit determines that the signal quality of the main channel is better than that of the standby channel, then turn to step 520, 620 to continue to optimize the signal in the standby channel. If the control unit determines that the signal quality of the standby channel is much better than that of the main channel, or the signal quality of the main channel decreases down to the specified threshold and the signal quality after optimization of the standby channel is better than this threshold, turn to step 530, 630 to perform hitless changeover.<br>
In steps 530,630, after optimizing the standby channel, the control unit determines that the signal quality of the main channel is much worse than that of the standby channel, or the signal quality of the main channel decreases down to the specified threshold and the signal quality after optimization of the standby channel is better than this threshold, the hitless changeover unit changes over the main channel and the standby channel, the current standby channel, i.e. channel 2, is chosen to output the signal. Now the primary standby channel, i.e. channel 2, is switched to be the main channel, while the primary main channel, i.e. channel 1, is switched to be the standby channel. Then return to steps 515, 615, and repeat the action above of monitoring in real time; meanwhile, in steps 535, 635, the signal of the main channel after the selection is output to the post-stage circuit.<br>
In the invention, the dynamitic filter is optional, and use of a dynamitic filter can further increase the adaptability of the receiver. Figure 7 is a optical eye pattern in the embodiment above after transmission of the direct modulated laser signal; figure 8 is an electrical eye pattern of this receiving device output at AGC circuit after transmission of the direct modulated laser signal when the bandwidth is 1.5*fb; figure 9 is an electrical eye pattern of this receiving device output at AGC circuit after transmission of the direct modulated laser signal when the bandwidth is 0.7*fb. It can be seen that the decision area of the eye pattern is different under different bandwidths of the receivers, the decision area of the receiving device of figure 9 is greater than that of figure 8, thus, the bit error rate of the receiving device illustrated in figure 9 under optimal decision level and decision time is better than the bit error rate of the receiver illustrated in figure 10.<br>
In the following, several specific methods for implementing signal quality detection, control unit, and hitless changeover unit will be introduced accompanying with the embodiment described above.<br>
1. Methods for implementing signal quality detection and control unit<br>
There are many methods for implementing signal quality detection and control unit, In signal quality detection, bit error rate of the signal can be detected, factor Q of the signal can also be detected, and other indexes which can represent performance of the signal can also be detected. The control unit can also adopt various tactics. By way of example, two methods for detecting signal quality and corresponding control tactics of the control units will be illustrated hereinafter.<br>
(1) a tactic based on bit error rate<br>
In a case of a dynamitic filter, many sets of dynamitic filter parameters are set. Under each set of dynamitic filter parameters, the decision level of LIA and the decision time of CDR circuit are changed, and bit error rates under different decision levels and different decision times are compared. The schematic drawing of the decision is shown in figure 10, wherein the longitudinal and the transverse lines of the eye pattern represent different decision times of CDR circuits and different decision levels of LIA respectively.<br>
For each set of dynamitic filter parameters, the value BERs (T,V) (bit error rate) under different decision times T and different decision levels V in the eye pattern are recorded, which means to record the BER at every point in the lattice in figure 10. The detected BER is compared with the specified BER threshold BERth (bit error rate threshold). The lattice illustrated in figure 10 represents the decision level and the decision time which are better than the condition of the specified the BERth. The interval between the farthest level of LIA and the periphery of the lattice is denoted by dV, the interval between the farthest decision time and the periphery of the lattice is denoted by dT. For different dynamitic filter parameters, areas of the lattice which are better than the condition of the specified BERth select optimal dynamitic filter parameters according to the rule of maximum area of lattice. Then, in the lattice with the largest area, the point which is furthest from both longitudinal and transverse direction is searched, thus the optimal decision level and decision time are got.<br><br>
When the BER of the main channel is worse than the specified threshold BERth, decision level and the decision time of the standby channel are first se at the optimal point above, then changeover is performed.<br>
In a case without the dynamitic filter, the theoretical block of the device of the invention is shown in figure 3, and the method of optimization is shown in figure 5. As long as the point in the lattice which is furthest from both longitudinal and transverse directions, the optimal decision level and decision time are got. Similarly, if the BER of the main channel is worse than the specified threshold BERth, the decision level and the decision time of the standby channel are first set at the optimal point, then changeover is performed.<br>
(2) a tactic based on factor Q<br>
Factor Q is used to measure the electrical SNR of the receiver at the decision circuit. This kind of electrical SNR finally determines the BER of the system. Factor Q is defined as the ratio of the signal to the noise at the decision level and the decision time. Provided the probabilities of signal 1 and signal 0 are the same, i.e., P(0)=P(1)=0.5, and provided the noise has no relationship with the statistical characteristics of the signal, factor Q is defined as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
There are many methods for detecting factor Q. The tactic based on factor Q of the invention is to get the factor Q by using an extrapolation method through the BER detected.<br>
The relationship between the BER of the signal and the factor Q is as follows:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Wherein, Vth is the decision level, µ1 and  µ0 are the average voltage for code "1" and code "0" respectively, σ1 and Σ0 are the root mean squares of the noise of code "1" and code "0" respectively. BER(Vth  and Q(Vth) are the BER and factor Q corresponding to the decision level respectively.<br>
Thus, the factor Q corresponding to each decision level and decision time can be calculated with the BER according to the equation above. For the factor Q corresponding to the decision level and the decision time without detecting the BER, it can be obtained by extrapolating the factor Q of the decision level and the decision time with detecting the BER.<br>
In figure 11, the BER corresponding to different decision levels and different decision times are shown. The factor Q corresponding to the decision level and decision time can be calculated according to the BER.<br>
By way of example, a factor Q corresponding to the optimal decision level at a certain decision time which is obtained through a linear extrapolation method is illustrated hereinafter. Provided decision levels A, B, and C, D lie on the two sides of the optimal decision level respectively, as shown in figure 12, the decision levels are VthA VthB, Vthc, and VthD respectively, the factors Q calculated through BER are QA , QB, Qc, and QD respectively. According to the factors Q QA and QB at the decision levels VthA and VthB, a beeline Q-Vth is matched. Also, according to the factors Q Qc and QD at the decision levels Vtt,c and V,ho, another beeline Q-Vth is matched. The crossing of these 2 beelines corresponds to the optimal decision level Vth and th. Based on the same theory, more BERs at decision levels can be detected, two Q-th beelines can be matched more accurately, and the optimal decision levels Vth and Q,th can be obtained according to the crossing point of the two beelines, as shown in figure 13.<br>
In the following, the optimization method based on the tactic of factor Q of the invention will be discussed.<br>
In a case with the dynamitic filter, under the condition of each set of parameters of dynamitic filter, the decision level of LIA and the decision time of CDR are changed, and the BERs (T, V) of different decision times T and decision levels V in the eye pattern are recorded. The factor Q corresponding to different decision time of CDR and different decision level of LIA can be calculated according to the BER. Since the BER is detected during a certain interval of detecting time, for the decision time of CDR and the decision level of LIA when the BER is better than detection precision, the factor Q is calculated using the extrapolation method above. Thus, the factors Q corresponding to each CDR decision time and LIA decision level can be obtained through calculation or detection, and the largest factor<br>
Q therein is searched. The largest factors Q under different dynamitic filter parameters are compared, and the optimal dynamitic filter parameter is chosen according to the principle that the factor Q is the largest, the corresponding largest factor Q is Qn. The CDR decision time and the LIA decision level corresponding to the Qn are the optimal decision time and the optimal decision level respectively. If the BER of the main channel is worse than the specified threshold Berth, the decision level and the decision time of the standby channel are set at the optimal point first, then changeover is performed.<br>
In a case without the dynamitic filter, the principle block of the device of the invention is shown in figure 3, and the optimization method is shown in figure 5. As long as the CDR decision time and the LIA decision level corresponding to the largest factor Q are found, they are the optimal decision level and the optimal decision time respectively. Similarly, if the BER of the main channel is worse than the specified threshold BERth, the decision level and the decision time of the standby channel are set at the optimal point first, then changeover is performed.<br>
2. a method for implementing the hitless changeover unit<br>
There are many methods for implementing the hitless changeover unit. By way of example, a method will be illustrated for implementing the hitless changeover unit of the signal based on SDH frame structure. This kind of hitless changeover unit is widely used in the system side of SDH system to perform the hitless changeover between the main and spare cross boards.<br>
The method for implementing the hitless changeover unit of the signal based on SDH frame structure is shown in figure 14. Two groups of signals after demultiplexing are searched by the SDH frame, then buffered by FIFO, and then output based on the SDH structure in the same sequence. Different time delays of the signals of the two channels are realized by setting the position of FIFO read/write pointer. The changeover control signal works at the position of Al or A2 where head of the SDH frame exists, thus the loss during the changeover only happens at the position of A1 or A2 where the head of the SDH frame exists, and the SDH payload and overhead are not affected, thus the hitless changeover control is implemented.<br>
For the signals with other frame structures, based on the same principle, the changeover<br>
can be performed at the frame aligning byte or at the position of redundancy information, and thus the hitless changeover control is performed.<br>
