				<td>ROLLER CHAIN<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	1.	Field of the Invention<br>
		The present invention relates to a roller chain that is lightweight and hard to<br>
	elongate, and can be constructed to afford inexpensive manufacturing and that has a<br>
	pitch of 12.7 corresponding to ISO08B, ISO08MB, ANSI40, and JIS4D.<br>
10	2.	Related Art<br>
		A roller chain of JIS40 comprises outer link plates 1. inner link plates 2. pins 3,<br>
	bushes 4, and rollers 5 and has a predetermined pitch P. More specifically, both ends of<br>
	a bush are press fitted into bush holes of the both inner link plates, the roller 5 is  notatably<br>
	supported on the bush 4, the pin is inserted into the bush hole, and both ends of the pin<br>
15	projecting from the inner fink plates are press fitted into holes of the outer link plates.<br>
	That is, an inner link that is constituted by the inner link plates 2, 2 and the bushes 4.4,<br>
	and an outer link that is constituted by the outer link plates 1, 1 and the pins 3, 3: are<br>
	connected to each other in a bendable manner.<br>
		By the way, a roller chain is wound on a drive sprocket and a driven sprocket to<br>
20	be able to transmit power of a drive shaft to a driven shaft. While other various means<br>
	for power transmission from a drive shaft to a driven shaft are existent, a roller chain<br>
	transmits a large power as compared with a bett transmission device, and affords freely<br>
	setting a distance between a drive shaft and a driven shaft and readily accommodating<br>
	for even the case where a distance between the both shafts is large, as compared with a<br>
25	power transmission device that comprises a gear mechanism with a plurality of gears<br>
	meshing with one another.<br>
		A roller chain is prescribed by JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) with respect to<br>
	fundamental dimensions and tensile strength. A roller chain of JIS40 has a pitch P =<br>
	12.7, a distance W = 14.4 between outer link plates, a thickness T = 1.5 of inner and<br>
30	outer link plates. A roller chain wound on sprockets of a drive shaft and a driven shaft<br>
	can run while rollers 5 mesh with teeth of the sprockets, and at this time, tension acts on<br>
	the outer iink plates 1 and the inner link plates 2 and the pins 3 and the bushes 4 perform<br>
	bending deformation due to the tension.<br>
		Accompanying the bending movements at the time of winding on the sprockets<br>
<br>
-1 -<br>
 <br>
	and at the time of separating from the sprockets, the pins 3 and the bushes 4 perform<br>
	rotating movements relative to each other Tension acting on the roller chain generates<br>
	a high surface pressure between the pin 3 and the bush holes, in which state rotating<br>
	movements cause the pin 3 and the bush holes to wear. This leads to generation of<br>
5	elongation of the chain.<br>
		Among performances of a roller chain, the tensile strength is important but<br>
	non-elongation is further important because the service life rarely expires due to<br>
	insufficiency in strength but elongation is increased to frequently cause expiration of the<br>
	service life. Elongation constitutes a phenomenon that certainty generates even in<br>
10	driving in a non-load state, and so it is not easy to cope with such phenomenon. While<br>
	the JIS standards include detailed regulations with respect to dimensions and strength of<br>
	a roller chain but do not include any regulations with respect to elongation that has a<br>
	significant influence in practical use.<br>
15	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		In this manner, conventional roller chains are manufactured on the basis of ISO<br>
	Standards, JIS Standards, etc. It is an object of the invention to provide a roller chain<br>
	that provides for tensile strength prescribed by ISO Standards, restricts elongation, is<br>
	extended in service life, and corresponds to 1SO08B, ISO08MB, and J1S40.<br>
20		A roller chain of the invention corresponding to ISO0SB or ISO08MB has a pitch<br>
	of 127 mm that is according to the standard and the same as that of conventional roller<br>
	chains. However, inner link plates and outer link plates have a thickness of 1.2 mm<br>
	smaller than that (a thickness of 1.5 mm) of conventional inner link plates and outer link<br>
	plates. Accordingly, a distance between both outer link plates amounts to 13.55 mm<br>
25	and a distance between both inner link plates amounts to 10.4 mm. However, joint link<br>
	plates, which are weak in strength, have the same thickness of 1.5 mm as that of<br>
	conventional roller chains.<br>
		Since outer link plates and inner link plates have a thickness of 1. 2 mm, a weight<br>
	per pitch becomes small and so it is of course possible to reduce manufacturing cost due<br>
30	to saving of materials. Since outer link plates and inner link plates are small in thickness,<br>
	bending moment acting on pins is decreased. That is, pins are bent due to a distance<br>
	between inner link plates and outer link plates. When such distance is small, bending<br>
	moment acting under the same tension can be restricted to a small magnitude and pins<br>
	and bushes are decreased in bending deformation.<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
		This brings about a decrease in local surface pressure on bush holes, so that it is<br>
	possible to restrict wear. Meanwhile, in the case where respective links are small in<br>
	mass, centrifugal forces are decreased when the links are wound on a sprocket to be<br>
	rotated This brings about a decrease in surface pressure between pins and bushes,<br>
5	and hence leads to restriction on wear.<br>
	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
		Fig, 1 is a view showing a roller chain according to the invention;<br>
		Fig. 2 is a view showing the relationship between a pin and a bush in the roller<br>
10	chain; and<br>
		Fig. 3 is a view showing a roller chain of J1S40.<br>
	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
		Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of a roller chain according to the invention, the<br>
15	roller chain corresponding to ISO08B or ISO08MB. The roller chain is different partially<br>
	in dimension from a roller chain of JIS40 shown in Fig. 3 while being the same in<br>
	fundamental construction as the latter. Pitch P is the same as that of the roller chain of<br>
	JJS40 to amount to 12 7 mm but a thickness of outer link plates 1 and inner link plates 2<br>
	are smaller than that of the latter to amount to T = 1.2 mm.<br>
20		Since the outer link plates 1 and inner link plates 2 are small in thickness,<br>
	respective parts of the roller chain are somewhat different in dimension from those of the<br>
	roller chain of JIS40 A distance between the both outer link plates 1,1 amounts to W =<br>
	13.55 mm, and a distance between the both inner link plates 2, 2 amounts to V = 10.4<br>
	mm. Since power is transmitted by winding the roller chain on a sprocket having the<br>
25	same face width as that of conventional ones, however, the rollers 5 have an outside<br>
	diameter of 8.5 mm and a distance between inner surfaces of the inner link plates 2, 2<br>
	amounts to 8.0 mm or more.<br>
		Bushes are not rotted ones but bushes manufactured by cold forming are used,<br>
	and joint links, which are weak in strength, have the same thickness of 1.5 mm as that of<br>
30	conventional roller chains. By the way, a thickness of the outer link plates 1 and the<br>
	Inner link plates 2 amounts to 1,2 mm in this manner whereby the roller chain is reduced<br>
	approximately 12 % in weight and decreased a little in tensile strength and fatigue<br>
	strength. However, saving in materials leads to a decrease of about 10 % in<br>
	manufacturing cost and an increase of about 10 % in wear performance (restriction of<br>
<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
	elongation).<br>
		Fig. 2 shows the relationship between the bush 4 and the pin 3 in the roller chain.<br>
	When tension P acts on the outer link plates 1 and the inner link plates 2, the pin 3 is bent<br>
	as shown in the figure. A moment M = 2PxA acts to cause bending deformation of the<br>
5	pin 3 where A indicates a distance between the outer link plates 1 and the inner link<br>
	plates 2 in this manner, the pin 3 is bent by the tension P. which acts on the roller chain.<br>
	and contacts with an inner peripheral surface of the bush hole to accelerate wear.<br>
		With the roller chain according to the invention, the outer link plates 1 and the<br>
	inner Iink plates 2 have a thickness of 1.2 mm whereby the distance A is decreased and<br>
10	a bending moment M generated with tension being the same is decreased, which leads<br>
	to restriction; on wear between pins and bushes.<br>
