				<td>A DISTRIBUTED CIRCULAR GEOMETRY POWER AMPLIFIER AND A<br>
METHOD FOR AMPLIFICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed towards a distributed circular geometry power<br>
amplifier and a method for amplification. Said invention relates to high frequency power<br>
amplifiers and more particularly to techniques for combining, monolithically or<br>
otherwise, individual power amplifiers to achieve power combining and impedance<br>
transformation.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
The design of high frequency power amplifiers with reasonable power levels,<br>
efficiency and gain remains one of the major challenges in the pursuit of a single-chip<br>
integrated transceiver. Although several advances have been made in this direction, the<br>
design of a truly integrated power amplifier on a lossy substrate, such as silicon or silicon<br>
germanium has been an elusive goal.<br>
Multiple external components such as bonding wires and external baluns have<br>
been used as tuned elements to produce output power levels in excess of 1W using<br>
CMOS transistors. See e.g., K.C. Tsai and P.R. Gray, "A 1.9 GHz. 1-W CMOS Class-E<br>
Power Amplifier for Wireless Communications", IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits,<br>
vol. 34, no. 7. pp. 962-969, July 1999[1]; and C. Yoo and Q. Huang. "A Common-Gate<br>
Switched. 0.9W Class-E Power Amplifier with 41% PAE in 0.25um CMOS.' Symposium<br>
on VLSI Circuits Digest, pp. 56-57, Honolulu, June 2000'2'. Similar performance levels<br>
have been achieved with Si-Bipolar transistors. See, e.g. W. Simbiirger, et al "A<br>
Monolithic Transformer Coupled 5-W Silicon Power Amplifier with 59% PAE at 0.9<br>
GHz/" IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 34, no. 12, pp. 1881-1892. Dec. 1999|3];<br>
and W. Simbiirger, et al, "A Monolithic 2.5V, 1W Silicon Bipolar Power Amplifier with<br>
55% PAE at 1.9 GHz, "IEEE MTT-S Digest, vol. 2, pp. 853-856. Boston. June, 2000[4]'.<br>
Moreover, alternative technologies for active devices with higher breakdown<br>
voltages and higher substrate resistivity have been used to increase the output power and<br>
efficiency of integrated amplifiers. For example, LDMOS transistors with a<br>
breakdown voltage of 20V have been used on a semi-insulating substrate, but still this<br>
design delivers only 200mW. See, Y. Tan, et al, "A 900-MHz Fully Integrated SOI<br>
Power Amplifier for Single-Chip Wireless Transceiver Applications," IEEE Solid-<br>
State Circ, vol. 3:5, no. 10, pp. 1481-1485, Oct. 2000 [5]. Further, GaAs MESFET's<br>
on insulating substrates have been used to integrate power amplifiers. J. Portilla, H.<br>
Garcia, and E. Artal, "High Power-Added Efficiency MMIC Amplifier for 2.4 GHz<br>
Wireless Communications," IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, vol. 34, no. 1, pp.<br>
120-123, Jan. 1999 [6] Unfortunately, these technologies are significantly more costly<br>
and more difficult to manufacture than conventional silicon-based transistor<br>
technologies, such as CMOS.<br>
A summary of these prior achievements in the design of high-frequency, low<br>
voltage power amplifiers is provided in Table 1:<br><br>
Two significant problems in the design of a fully-integrated high speed solid<br>
state power amplifier using conventional silicon technologies such as CMOS are (1)<br>
the low resistivity of the lossy substrate which increases the loss of on-chip inductors<br>
and transformers; and (2) the low breakdown voltages of the transistors. These<br>
problems are exacerbated as the minimum feature sizes of the transistors (such as<br>
CMOS) are scaled down for faster operation.<br>
More particularly, the high conductivity of lossy substrates causes long metal<br>
lines, including conventional spiral inductors fabricated on the same substrate, to be<br>
very lossy in terms of power. If the metal lines are made wide to reduce resistance,<br>
the capacitive coupling effect between the metal and substrate will drain part of the<br>
current to the substrate, thereby increasing power dissipation. On the other hand, if<br>
the metal lines are made narrow enough to effectively overcome this problem, the<br>
metal resistance will significantly increase, again absorbing (dissipating) a significant<br>
portion of the power.<br>
The low breakdown voltage of conventional transistors such as CMOS, for example,<br>
limits the maximum allowable drain voltage swing of the transistor. This makes it necessary<br>
to perform some form of impedance transformation to achieve a larger output power. For<br>
example, a±2V drain voltage swing delivers only 40mW to a 50O load if no such<br>
impedance transformation is performed. While impedance transformation can be achieved<br>
using a 1:n transformer, unfortunately, an on-chip spiral 1:n transformer on a standard<br>
CMOS substrate is very lossy and will degrade the performance of the amplifier greatly.<br>
Alternatively, an on-chip resonant match could be used, but this technique also results in<br>
significant power loss.<br>
In sum, as all high frequency power amplifiers ostensibly require some inductors -<br>
essentially long metal lines - for matching purposes, connections for the supplies, and some<br>
form of power combining, conventional power amplifier circuits tend to be very power<br>
inefficient and not commercially viable above certain power and frequency levels.<br>
Thus, it would be highly desirable 1o have a low cost, fully integratable topology for<br>
a power amplifier that can be fabricated with low cost, silicon-based processes and that can<br>
provide significant output power levels in the microwave and millimeter-wave frequency<br>
ranges. It would also be desirable if such a topology could be implemented with discrete<br>
power amplifiers as well as monolithic integration techniques. Ideally, this architecture<br>
would also be useful in the design of both lossy substrate IC's as well as non-lossy substrate<br>
IC's.<br>
US 5,066,925 discloses a composite MMIC amplifier having a plurality of active<br>
devices arranged in a line. The active devices are arranged in pairs, a respective one of each<br>
dealing with the positive end of a microwave signal and the other dealing with the negative<br>
end. To one side of the array of active devices there are provided two trees of strip<br>
connections, respectively providing the positive and negative ends of the input signal to the<br>
inputs of the active devices. On the other side of the array of active devices, respective trees<br>
are provided to gather the positive and negative ends of the output signals from the active<br>
devices to common positive and negative outputs. A respective integrated spiral inductor is<br>
connected between the positive and negative output of each pair.<br>
WO 97/02654 discloses a bridge circuit comprising two transistors in each leg, the<br>
nodes between each pair being connected by the primary of an output transformer. A radio<br>
frequency input is coupled to the gates of each of the four transistors by a transformer<br>
having a single primary and four secondaries, one for each gate. In one state, the current<br>
Hows between the supply rails via the upper transistor of one leg, the primary of the output<br>
transformer and the lower transistor of the other leg. In the other state the current flows<br>
through the other two transistors via a primary of the output transformer, but in the opposite<br>
direction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, which addresses these needs, resides in a distributed, circular-<br>
geometry, power amplifier as a means for power combining and impedance transformation<br>
to achieve a very high output power in a small package and to overcome the low breakdown<br>
voltage of conventional active devices such as short-channel MOS transistors.<br>
In particular, the present invention resides in a distributed, circular<br>
geometry, power amplifier for amplifying an RF input signal that comprises a plurality of<br>
smaller push-pull amplifiers. Each amplifier includes two gain blocks that each has<br>
an input port with positive and negative terminals and an output port with positive and<br>
negative terminals. The two gain blocks of each push-pull amplifier are<br>
interconnected at the positive terminals of their respective output ports by an<br>
inductive path and share a common supply voltage to the positive terminals of their<br>
respective output ports. The negative terminal of the output port of each gain block of<br>
each push-pull amplifier is connected to negative terminal of the output port of a gain<br>
block of an adjacent push-pull amplifier such that the amplifiers are configured in an<br>
interconnected circular geometry, with the connected negative terminals of adjacent<br>
gain blocks being connected together to form a virtual ac ground.<br>
In operation, the input port of each gain block is adapted to receive an ac input<br>
signal of at least substantially equal magnitude and opposite phase relative to the<br>
input port of an adjacent gain block. The push-pull amplifiers are interconnected such<br>
that, for the fundamental frequency of operation, virtual ac-grounds are presented at<br>
the negative terminals of the output ports of the gain blocks.<br>
In a more detailed aspect of the present invention, the distributed circular<br>
geometry power amplifier comprises at least two push-pulls amplifiers designed to<br>
amplify an RF input signal. A first push-pull amplifier includes a first gain block and<br>
a second gain block, each block having an input port with positive and negative<br>
terminals and an output port with positive and negative terminals, the blocks being<br>
interconnected at. the positive terminals of their respective output ports by an<br>
inductive path. A second push-pull amplifier includes a third gain block adjacent the<br>
second gain block and a fourth gain block, the third and fourth gain block each having<br>
an input port with positive and negative terminals and an output port with positive and<br>
negative terminals, the gain blocks of the second push-pull amplifier being<br>
interconnected at the positive terminals of their respective output ports by an<br>
inductive path. In order to create the "circular" closed loop, the second and third gain<br>
blocks are interconnected at the negative terminals of their respective output ports and<br>
the negative terminal of the output port of the fourth gain block is connected to the<br>
negative terminal of the output port of the first gain block such that substantially all ac<br>
current that flows from the fourth gain block flows into the first gain block. The<br>
fourth and first gain blocks may, but typically will not, be directly connected to each<br>
other. In a typical configuration, at least (and preferable more than) one additional<br>
push-pull amplifier having a pair of interconnected gain blocks is provided between<br>
the fourth and first gain block, such that the negative terminal of the output port of the<br>
fourth gain block is indirectly connected to the negative terminal of the output port of<br>
the first gain block via this at least one additional push-pull amplifier.<br>
In a more detailed embodiment, the power amplifier further includes a third<br>
and fourth push-pull amplifier, thereby creating a quad-push-pull power amplifier<br>
with eight gain blocks. In particular, the third push-pull amplifier has fifth and sixth<br>
gain blocks, each having an input port with positive and negative terminals and an<br>
output port with positive and negative terminals, the fifth and sixth blocks being<br>
interconnected at the positive terminals of their respective output ports by an<br>
inductive path. Similarly, the fourth push-pull amplifier has seventh and eighth gain<br>
blocks, each block having an input port with positive and negative terminals and an<br>
output port with positive and negative terminals, the seventh and eighth blocks being<br>
interconnected at the positive terminals of their respective output ports by an<br>
inductive path. The quad-amplifier device is interconnected such that the negative<br>
terminal of the output port of the fourth gain block is connected to the negative<br>
terminal of the output port of the fifth gain block, the negative terminal of output port<br>
of the sixth gain block is connected to the negative terminal of the output port of the<br>
seventh gain block, and the negative terminal of output port of the eighth gain block is<br>
connected to the negative terminal of the output port of the first gain block.<br>
The gain blocks that comprise the push-pull amplifiers used by the present<br>
invention may take various configurations, depending on the desired gain, circuit<br>
complexity, cost and other factors. In one basic embodiment, each gain block of each<br>
push-pull amplifier comprises a single three-terminal active device, such as a CMOS<br>
or bipolar transistor, having a cathode, an anode, and a control terminal. In another<br>
embodiment, each gain block of each push-pull amplifier comprises a compound<br>
device having at least a first and a last three-terminal active device. The active<br>
devices of each gain block are connected together in a cascoded fashion such that the<br>
cathode of the first active device serves as the negative terminal of the output port of<br>
each gain block, the anode of the last active device serves as the positive terminal of<br>
the output port of each gain block, and the control terminal of the first active device -is<br>
the input port of the gain block. With this configuration, each push-pull amplifier,<br>
and thus the power amplifier, can advantageously supply more gain than can a single<br>
transistor per gain block design.<br>
The power amplifier of the present invention enables the push-pull amplifiers<br>
to be monolithically integrated onto a single chip. Moreover, the inductive path of<br>
each push-pull amplifier may simply be a metal slab and more particularly a<br>
substantially straight metal slab.<br>
In yet further improvements to the design of the present invention, the power<br>
amplifier may further include a resonant, harmonic tuning capacitor that is connected<br>
between the positive terminals of the output ports of adjacent gain blocks of adjacent<br>
push-pull amplifiers. The amplifier may also include an inductive loop disposed<br>
between the input ports of adjacent gain blocks of adjacent push-pull amplifiers in<br>
order to tune the impedance presented to the RF input signal.<br>
Turning to the RF input side, in order for the circuit to operate properly, a<br>
balanced input must be provided to all input ports of all gain blocks. To address this,<br>
an input power splitting network is included that symmetrically connects an in-phase<br>
balanced input signal to be amplified to the input ports of all gain blocks. The input<br>
power splitting network may symmetrically connect the in-phase balanced input<br>
signal from a point inside the circular geometry of the power amplifier or from points<br>
outside the circular geometry of the power amplifier.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the power amplifier further includes a<br>
power-combining circuit connected to the push-pull amplifiers that combines the<br>
signals amplified by each of the push-pull amplifiers. In order to achieve power-<br>
combining, the push-pull amplifiers are preferably configured as a first closed loop to<br>
form a circular geometry primary winding of an active transformer and the<br>
power-combining circuit is configured as a secondary winding of the active<br>
transformer that is located in proximity with and magnetically coupled to the primary<br>
winding. Thus, the secondary winding has a single output that provides the summed<br>
outputs of the push-pull amplifiers in the closed first loop. The secondary winding<br>
may be a single turn circuit or multiple turn circuit.<br>
Furthermore, the secondary winding may advantageously comprise a single or<br>
multiple turn inductors formed by a variable width metal line. The metal line has<br>
sections that are relatively wide where a low ac voltage is present relative to the<br>
substrate and relatively narrow where a high ac voltage relative to the substrate is<br>
present. This geometry offers the advantage of further reducing the power loss, as it<br>
takes advantage of low metal resistance of wider metal where the ac voltage signal is<br>
low, thus reducing the loss and takes advantage of low capacitive coupling to the<br>
substrate of a narrower metal where the ac voltage is high, thus again reducing the<br>
loss. In this fashion, both the metal resistance loss and capacitive coupling loss are<br>
reduced<br>
Turning momentarily back to the input circuit, the input power splitting<br>
network disclosed above may advantageously comprise a plurality of twisted input<br>
loops in proximity with the secondary winding, thereby providing magnetic coupling<br>
from the secondary winding. This geometry offers the advantage of further enhancing<br>
the gain or linearity of each push-pull amplifier in the power amplifier.<br>
In yet a more detailed aspect of the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, an additional secondary winding in proximity with and magnetically<br>
coupled to the primary and secondary windings may be provided to create an<br>
interdigitated transformer with its attendant benefits of lower power loss.<br>
Alternatively, or in addition to the multiple secondary winding improvement, the<br>
power amplifier of the present invention may further include at least one additional<br>
circular geometry primary winding in proximity with and magnetically coupled to the<br>
primary and secondary windings to create an interdigitated transformer.<br>
A method of combining the amplified outputs of a plurality of push-pull<br>
amplifiers to form a power amplifier is also disclosed. In this method, each amplifier<br>
includes two inductively-gain blocks interconnected by an inductive path. The<br>
method comprises configuring the plurality of amplifiers to form a first closed loop<br>
such that adjacent gain blocks of adjacent amplifiers are interconnected and as so<br>
interconnected, form virtual ac grounds at their junctions, and driving adjacent gain<br>
blocks of adjacent push-pull amplifiers with at least substantially equal and opposite<br>
input signals. In a more detailed aspect of the present invention, the method further<br>
includes combining the output power of the push-pull amplifiers in the first closed<br>
loop in a secondary coil that is located in proximity with and magnetically coupled to<br>
the first closed loop.<br>
A low loss inductor for deposition on a substrate of an integrated circuit that<br>
processes voltage signals is also described. The inductor includes an elongated<br>
conductive body deposed on the substrate and having first and second ends,<br>
conductive sections disposed between the ends, and an average ac signal voltage<br>
acorss the body, such that a section where the signal voltage is determined to be lower<br>
than the average ac signal voltage across the body is relatively wider than another<br>
section of the inductor whereat the signal voltage is determined to be higher than the<br>
average ac signal voltage across the body.<br>
Additionally described is a method for reducing the electrical losses of an<br>
inductor deposed on a substrate of an integrated circuit, the inductor have an<br>
elongated body with interconnected conducting sections, an average width and an<br>
average ac signal voltage across the body. The method includes decreasing the width<br>
of a section of the body of the inductor relative to the average width whereat the ac<br>
voltage signal on the section is relatively higher than the average ac signal voltage<br>
across the inductor body; and increasing the width of another section of the body of<br>
the inductor whereat the ac voltage signal on the other section is relatively lower than<br>
the average ac signal voltage across the inductor body.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention improves the performance and efficiency of high-<br>
frequency power amplifiers, especially for those used in modem communications<br>
devices and systems.<br>
The present invention discloses novel combinations of three-terminal active<br>
devices used as amplifiers or switches or used as components of amplifiers or<br>
switches. The term "gain block" is used herein to generically describe any component<br>
or combination of components that is capable of providing gain. Thus, a gain block<br>
may include a single three-terminal active device, such as a transistor, or a<br>
combination thereof. The three terminals of an active device are herein referred to as<br>
the "control terminal," the "anode", and the "cathode," corresponding, for example, to<br>
the gate, g, drain, d, and source, s, of a FET transistor, respectively, and<br>
corresponding to the base, collector, and emitter of a BJT transistor. Thus, these<br>
terms are to be understood in their broadest senses. Accordingly, the embodiments<br>
described and shown hereinbelow that employ FET transistors are merely illustrative<br>
and are by no means intended to limit the invention.<br>
The design evolution leading to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention is now described.<br>
A) Push-Pull Driver<br>
FIG. 1 a shows a high level conceptual schematic of a basic push-pull amplifier<br>
design 1, which is used as the main building block of the distributed power amplifier<br>
of the present invention. The amplifier comprises a first gain block 2, having an input<br>
port 3 with positive and negative terminals and an output port 4 with positive and<br>
negative terminals, and a second gain block 6 having an input port 7 with positive and<br>
negative terminals and an output port 8 with positive and negative terminals. The<br>
amplifiers are connected together at their respective positive terminals of their outputs<br>
via an inductive path 9. As denoted by the "+" sign at input port 3 and the "-" sign at<br>
input port 7, the feature that makes this design a "push-pull" amplifier is that the input<br>
port 3 of gain block 2 and the input port 7 of gain block 6 are driven differentially,<br>
i.e., by equal amplitude, but opposite phase, RF signals. This topology creates a<br>
"virtual ac ground" near the center 5 of the inductive path 9 which, as shown, can be<br>
used as a point to supply dc bias Vddif desired, thereby reducing the filtering<br>
requirements on the supply.<br>
FIG. lb shows one specific implementation of the push-pull amplifier shown<br>
in FIG. la. In this implementation, each gain block is simply a single three-terminal<br>
active device, shown here as a FET transistor. In particular, the amplifier comprises a<br>
first transistor 12 having a control terminal (gate) 14, an anode (drain) 16 and a<br>
cathode (source) 18 and a second transistor 22 having a control terminal (gate) 24, an<br>
anode (drain) 26 and a cathode (source) 28. The anodes 16 and 26 are interconnected<br>
by a metal slab 20 and biased with a common dc drain voltage Vdd 29. As seen in the<br>
electrical equivalent drawing of FIG. lc, the metal slab 20 acts as a drain tuning<br>
inductor 20 to resonate transistor parasitic capacitance and control harmonic signals.<br>
As discussed below, the slab can also act as, or as part of, a primary circuit of a<br>
distributed active transformer. As the inputs are differentially driven, this topology<br>
creates a virtual ac ground at the Vdd supply node 21 (which is approximately, but not<br>
necessarily, at the midpoint of the metal slab 20) for the fundamental frequency and<br>
odd harmonics of the drain voltage. This virtual ground is an important feature of the<br>
push-pull driver, making it unnecessary to use a separate choke inductor and/or a<br>
large on-chip bypass capacitor at the supply.<br>
The push-pull amplifier shown in FIG. lb is used as the main building block<br>
for one preferred embodiment of the circular-geometry active-transformer power<br>
amplifier developed and shown below. However, it should be clearly understood that<br>
the push-pull amplifier used in the present invention is not limited to the single<br>
transistor pair shown in FIG. lb. Fundamentally, the topology of the present<br>
invention encompasses any appropriately interconnected gain block pair driven as a<br>
push-pull amplifier. For example, each gain block, 2 and 6, shown in FIG. la could<br>
comprise a compound active device architecture to achieve higher gain than the single<br>
transistor pair.<br>
One such preferred embodiment is the cascode design wherein two or more<br>
active devices are cascoded together to create even higher gain push-pull amplifiers.<br>
In particular, in the cascoded gain block 30 shown in FIG. 1d, the cathode 33 of the<br>
first, common-cathode active device 32 serves as the negative terminal of the output<br>
port of the gain block, the anode 38 of the last cascode-connected active device 38<br>
serves as the positive terminal of the output port of the gain block, and the control<br>
terminal 34 of the first, common-cathode device 32 is the positive input of the gain<br>
block. As further shown, one or more additional active devices may be connected<br>
between the first and last active devices to even further increase the gain of the gain<br>
block.<br>
It will be understood that other known compound, active devices, such as the<br>
Darlington transistor pair, may be used as the gain blocks implemented by the present<br>
invention.<br>
B) Quad-Push-Pull Circular Geometry<br>
In one preferred embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2a, the "circular geometry"<br>
amplifier includes four push-pull amplifiers 40, 60, 80 and 100, totaling eight gain<br>
blocks of the type shown in FIG. 1 a. As seen, the device is arranged such that gain<br>
blocks of adjacent amplifiers are interconnected at the negative terminals of their<br>
respective output ports to form a closed loop. Thus, as seen at one corner, the<br>
negative terminal of output port of gain block 50 of amplifier 40 is connected to the<br>
negative terminal of the output port of gain block 70 of amplifier 60.<br>
FIG. 2b shows one implementation of the amplifier of FIG. 2a, whereby each<br>
push-pull amplifier of the type shown in FIG. 1 a is the simple two-transistor push-pull<br>
amplifier of the type shown in FIG. lb and forms one side of a square. The strategic<br>
positioning of the four push-pull amplifiers 40, 60 , 80 and 100 enables the use of<br>
four straight and wide metal lines 42 , 62 , 82 , and 102 , respectively, as the drain<br>
inductors. A slab inductor exhibits a higher quality factor, e.g. Q ~ 20 to 30, than a<br>
spiral inductor with a Q ~ 5 to 10, and hence will lower the power losses in the<br>
passive network. As seen, the slab inductors also provide inherently low resistance<br>
paths for the dc current to flow from the supply to the drains of the transistors.<br>
At the corners, the sources of adjacent transistors of adjacent amplifiers are<br>
connected together and also share a common ground. As shown by the "+" and "-"<br>
symbols, at each corner the two adjacent transistors are driven in opposite phases. For<br>
example, cathode (source) 58 of transistor 50 of push-pull amplifier 40 and cathode<br>
(source) 72 of transistor 70 of amplifier 60 are interconnected and also connected to<br>
ground, labeled GND. Further, when the control terminal (gate) 56 of transistor 50 of<br>
push-pull amplifier 40 is driven by a positive phase signal, the control terminal (gate)<br>
71 of transistor 70 of push-pull amplifier 60 is driven by the negative phase signal.<br>
In this way, a virtual ac ground is created in each comer of the square. This is a<br>
significant feature of the circular geometry, as the fundamental and odd harmonics of<br>
the ac signal will not leave the loop comprising the four metal slabs as shown by the<br>
current loop in FIG. 2b. Thus, any connection from this square to the supply voltage<br>
or ground will not carry any ac signals at the fundamental frequency or its odd<br>
harmonics. This practically limits the loss in the supply connection to dc ohmic loss<br>
of the connecting line, which can be easily minimized using wider metal line.<br>
Further, a very small or even no capacitor is required to filter the supply. It is<br>
noteworthy that the topology of FIGS. 2a and 2b does not form a virtual ground at the<br>
supply and ground nodes for the even harmonics. Thus, the transistors see relatively<br>
high impedance at the even harmonics compared to the fundamental and the odd<br>
harmonics. These adjacent transistors also share a common supply.<br>
It should be understood that the four (4) push-pull amplifier design shown in<br>
FIGS. 2a and 2b and carried through the remaining figures, is but one example of the<br>
circular geometry topology of the present invention. The topology of the present<br>
invention includes at a minimum two (2) push-pull amplifiers interconnected and<br>
driven as described above, each push-pull pair comprising two (2) gain blocks.<br>
Increasing the number of interconnected push-pull pairs has two advantageous effects.<br>
First, the overall circuit output power capacity obviously increases with an increasing<br>
number of push-pull amplifiers. Second, the circuit increasingly takes on a circular<br>
shape. This is desirable because the topology increases in efficiency the more closely<br>
the circuit approaches the shape of a true circle.<br>
This topology creates a distributed amplifier having individual radiating RF<br>
power outputs. In the embodiments described in section "D" below, the power<br>
outputs are combined to provide a single output that is essentially the sum of the<br>
individual outputs and that has a far greater efficiency than is conventionally<br>
obtainable. However, it should be understood that these outputs may or may not be<br>
electro-magnetically combined, depending on the application. For example, the<br>
outputs may simply radiate in free space or drive independent loads.<br>
C) Impedance and Harmonic Control<br>
Providing the correct impedances to the power amplifier is crucial for correct<br>
operation. All amplifiers will need to present the correct impedance to the transistor<br>
at the fundamental frequency, and controlling the higher order harmonic content of<br>
the signal inside the amplifier plays a major role in the performance of a switching<br>
amplifier. As depicted in FIGS. 3a and 3b, these functions can be achieved by<br>
connecting four capacitors 110,120, 130 and 140 between the drains of the adjacent<br>
transistors, one in each comer of the square. These capacitors assist in controlling the<br>
impedance seen by the transistors at the fundamental frequency, decrease the levels of<br>
the overtones at the output, and assist in providing to the transistors suitable<br>
impedances for use as a switching amplifier. Because of the inductor used in the<br>
basic push/pull circuit, unless appropriate measures are taken, the impedance<br>
presented to the transistors at the fundamental frequency will be significantly<br>
inductive. By placing these capacitors in parallel with the inductance, the impedance<br>
may be varied appropriately for the class of operation to be used. For instance, class-<br>
A operation would normally size the capacitor so that the impedance at the<br>
fundamental is purely resistive. The second benefit of the capacitors is that their low<br>
impedance at the harmonic overtones will aid in filtering these frequencies from the<br>
output signal, reducing the need for additional post-amplifier filtering. The third<br>
benefit, which is applicable when operated as a high-efficiency switching amplifier, is<br>
that the placement of this capacitor allows harmonic timing appropriate for E/F<br>
operation to be achieved. Since they are connected between the drains of the two<br>
transistors, they will only affect fundamental and odd harmonics since the even<br>
harmonic voltages are equal in magnitude and phase on both terminals of the<br>
capacitors. Thus, these capacitors are used to obtain the desired inductive impedance<br>
at the fundamental frequency, and provide very low impedances at odd harmonics,<br>
while maintaining high impedances for even harmonics. This selective impedance<br>
control allows each push-pull amplifier to be driven as a power efficient switching<br>
amplifier operating in class "inverse F, " or in a group of classes called "class E/F",<br>
which includes, for example, class-E/F3, and class-E/Fodd- This topology can also be<br>
used in many other amplifier classes, such as linear class-A, AB, B, and C or non-<br>
linear amplifier classes by adjusting the drain inductance and corner capacitance to<br>
resonate the transistor drain-bulk capacitance, thereby providing the appropriate load<br>
for these classes.<br>
D) Output Power Combining<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the quad-push-pull amplifier design shown in<br>
FIG. 2b, with its four relatively large slab inductors that creates the square geometry,<br>
is used as the primary circuit of a magnetically coupled active transformer to combine<br>
the output power of these four push-pull amplifiers and to match their small drain<br>
impedance to a typically 50O unbalanced or balanced load. The ability to drive an<br>
unbalanced load is essential to avoid an external balun for driving commonly used<br>
single-ended antennas, transmission lines, filters and RF switches. As seen in FIG.<br>
2b, these four push-pull amplifiers driven by alternating phases generate a uniform<br>
circular current at the fundamental frequency around the square resulting in a strong<br>
magnetic flux through the square.<br>
As seen in FIG. 3a, a one-turn metal coil 150 inside this primary coil power<br>
amplifier square can be used to harness this alternating magnetic flux and act as the<br>
transformer secondary loop. It also provides an impedance transformation ratio of 8:1<br>
to present impedance of approximately 6.25O (50O/8) to the drains of the transistors.<br>
Ignoring these losses, for a ±2V drain voltage swing in the linear mode of operation,<br>
this transformation and combining process raises the potential output power of the<br>
amplifier to a 50 O load from Pout Vdd2 /(2 x Rout) = 22/(2 x 50O) - 40mW to Pout<br>
8 x Vdd2 /(2 x Pout/8) = 8 x 2V2 /(2 x 50/8) = 2.56W. As the transformer-coupling<br>
factor, k, is lower than 1 (typically around k=0.6-0.8) a capacitor, 204 is connected in<br>
parallel to the output (see FIG. 8) to compensate for the leakage inductance of the<br>
transformer.<br>
In a variation to the secondary winding 150 shown in FIG. 3a, the secondary<br>
winding may advantageously comprise a variable width metal line. Conceptually, the<br>
metal line has sections that are relatively wide where a low ac voltage is present<br>
relative to the substrate upon which the metal line is deposed, and relatively narrow<br>
where a high ac voltage relative to the substrate is present. This geometry offers the<br>
advantage of further reducing the power loss, as it takes advantage of the lower metal<br>
resistance of wider metal where the ac voltage signal is low (relative to the substrate),<br>
thus reducing the loss and takes advantage of low capacitive coupling to the substrate<br>
of a narrower metal where the ac voltage is high (relative to the substrate), thus again<br>
reducing the loss. In this fashion, both the metal resistance loss and capacitive<br>
coupling loss are reduced<br>
Thus, for example, as seen in FIG. 3b, a variable metal width one turn square<br>
coil inside the primary coil is used to harness the alternating magnetic flux and act as<br>
the transformer secondary loop, which further improves the efficiency of the device.<br>
In particular, viewing counterclockwise from the output, straight sections 150a-150e<br>
of the relatively square secondary coil become progressively wider, thereby creating<br>
an unbalanced single turn square inductor. The average width of the inductor along<br>
the entire path may be the same as in nonvariable secondary loop case shown in FIG.<br>
3a, thus keeping the same total conductor resistance while reducing the overall loss.<br>
Alternative geometries that provide reduced losses over inductors without varying<br>
widths are possible for this and other integrate circuit applications, such as a multiple<br>
turn square spiral, multiple turn circular spiral, a line inductor with graduating steps, a<br>
tapered line inductor and a meandering line inductor.<br>
Turning back to FIG. 3a, due to the symmetry of the push-pull topology, the<br>
even harmonics are significantly rejected and are thus effectively not coupled to the<br>
secondary 150. Also the transistor drain to bulk capacitance and the corner capacitors<br>
will practically short-circuit all odd harmonics except the fundamental frequency<br>
signal, thus attenuating odd harmonics at the output.<br>
The circular-geometry active-transformer topology of the present invention<br>
provides another benefit over the design of conventional harmonically-controlled<br>
amplifier classes (e.g., class F, inverse class F). Unlike these single-ended<br>
harmonically-controlled amplifier classes that require individual adjustments for each<br>
harmonic, this topology only requires adjustment at the fundamental frequency during<br>
the design process in order to realize class E/F designs. Once the fundamental<br>
frequency is set, all other harmonics will see the desired impedances automatically.<br>
This is because the E/F mode of operation can be achieved by presenting low<br>
impedances at selected odd harmonics, a capacitive impedance 1(j?Cs) at the even<br>
harmonics, and a load impedance at the fundamental which is has an appropriate<br>
amount of inductance. The low impedances at odd harmonics is achieved using the<br>
relatively large tuning capacitors 110, 120, 130 and 140, which are effectively in<br>
parallel with the transistor drains at the odd harmonics. At the even harmonics,<br>
however, the transistors only "see" their own output capacitance. This is because<br>
each transistor has the same signal amplitude and phase at these frequencies and so all<br>
of the other components in the circuit which are connected between the transistors<br>
will conduct no current at these harmonics, making them have no effect on the<br>
impedance. The inductive fundamental impedance is achieved by tuning the parallel<br>
RLC circuit connected between the transistor drains to resonate at a slightly higher<br>
frequency than the fundamental. By varying this tuning, the inductance of the load at<br>
the fundamental frequency may be varied to achieve zero-voltage-switching<br>
conditions resulting in high efficiency operation. Thus by utilizing the circuit<br>
symmetry to separate the even and odd harmonics, the circuit provides low<br>
impedances at the odd harmonics, capacitive impedance at the even harmonics, and an<br>
the appropriate inductive load in such a way so that only the fundamental frequency<br>
impedance need be tuned carefully.<br>
E) Input Power Splitting and Matching<br>
Turning now to the input signal, in the quad-push-pull design shown in FIGS.<br>
2a, 2b and 3, a typical 50O unbalanced input must be matched and transformed into<br>
four balanced drive signals at the eight (8) gates, resulting in similar challenges as<br>
those described with respect to the output network. To address this, a gate-matching<br>
inductive loop is connected between the gates at each comer of the square, for a total<br>
of four (4) loops, in order to resonate the gate capacitance at the fundamental<br>
frequency. One such corner is shown in FIG. 4, wherein an inductive loop 180 is<br>
connected between the gates 162 and 172 of transistors 160 and 170, respectively, and<br>
is shown schematically as an inductor 180 . The single, differentially driven loop<br>
inductor exhibits better Q (10-15) than normal spiral inductors. The middle points of<br>
these inductive loops form virtual ac grounds that make it unnecessary to use a large<br>
capacitor to ac ground this point, while blocking the dc voltage.<br>
As seen in FIG. 5, the input power splitting network consists of three parts,<br>
namely: (1) a 1:1 input spiral transformer balun 190; (2) the connecting differential<br>
lines 192a, 192b, that brings the balanced signal to a center point 195 of the square;<br>
and (3) the splitting network 194 symmetrically connecting the center point 195 to the<br>
gates of all transistors. Thus, the splitting network 194 provides in-phase balanced<br>
input signals to the gates of each push-pull pair transistor. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, illustratively shown in FIG. 6, the splitting network 194 comprises<br>
carefully shaped metal lines 194a-194f that take predetermined twisted paths to the<br>
transistors. This provides positive magnetic coupling from the output transformer<br>
(secondary coil) 196 to each input connection, thereby further enhancing the gain of<br>
each individual amplifier and thus the entire amplifier.<br>
A parallel capacitor 205 (shown in FIG. 8) and series capacitors 206, 207a,<br>
and 207b are also inserted at the input to resonate the leakage inductance and provide<br>
matching to 50Q at the input side of the spiral 1:1 on-chip balun 190. It is noted that<br>
none of the bonding wires are used as inductors making it unnecessary to fine tune<br>
their value for optimum operation.<br>
The input feeding can alternatively be made from the outside of the loop, thus<br>
reducing the power loss caused by currents induced in the metal lines due to magnetic<br>
coupling from the output.<br>
F) Interdigitation<br>
A further improvement to the active-transformer power amplifier of the<br>
present invention is shown in FIG. 7a. In a high frequency planar active transformer<br>
of the type discussed herein, the current in the primary loop 200 tends to concentrate<br>
at the edges of their metal conductors facing the secondary circuit 204. Moreover, the<br>
current in the secondary circuit also concentrates at the edges of its conductor facing<br>
the primary winding. This "current crowding" increases the losses in the relatively<br>
wide metal conductors because the conductors are effectively being used as relatively<br>
narrow conductors having higher resistances.<br>
In order to reduce these losses, the primary circuit may include a second loop<br>
202 placed on the inside track of the secondary, or output loop 204, thereby<br>
"interdigitatmg" the coils. In this way, the current in the primary is split, or<br>
distributed, between the edges of the pair of input loops 200 and 202, effectively<br>
doubling the number of edges through which the current flows. This results in an<br>
effective lower overall metal resistance and hence lowers overall loss. It should be<br>
understood that the secondary loops may or may not be connected together.<br>
Alternative interdigitation schemes are also possible. One such scheme is shown in<br>
FIG. 7b, wherein multiple secondary loops are mterdigitated with multiple primary<br>
loops.<br>
G) Experimental Results<br>
As stated above, the new circular geometry topology of the present invention<br>
can be used to implement both linear and switching power amplifiers. As a<br>
demonstration of the concepts of the present invention, a 2.2-W, 2.4-GHz single-<br>
stage fully-integrated circular-geometry switching power amplifier in class E/F3 was<br>
fabricated and measured using 0.35 µm CMOS transistors in a BiCMOS process<br>
technology.<br>
The process implemented three metal layers, the top one being 3 µm thick with<br>
a distance of 4.3 urn from the substrate, the substrate having a resistivity of 8O-cm.<br>
The chip area is 1.3 mm x 2.0mm including pads. Quasi-3D electro-magnetic<br>
simulation using SONNET and circuit simulation using ADS was performed on the<br>
complete structure as a part of the design cycle to verify performance of the amplifier.<br>
The complete electrical diagram of the designed circuit is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
The electrical components in general correspond to the physical components<br>
illustratively shown in FIGS. 2-5. In particular, the four push pull amplifiers 40 , 60 ,<br>
80 and 100 that comprise the primary coil of the active transformer shown in FIG. 2b<br>
are illustrated in FIG. 8 as drain inductors Ld with a transistor at each end that are<br>
driven in opposite phase from each other. The transistor input matching loop 180 of<br>
FIG. 4 is represented as gate inductors Lg 180 and 180 and is repeated at each comer<br>
of the square. The square secondary coil 150 shown in FIGS. 3 - 5 is represented by<br>
four serially connected secondary coils of the transformer 151, 152, 153 and 154 that<br>
match each of the four primary coils that are part of push-pull amplifiers 40 60 , 80 ,<br>
and 100 , respectively. The input matching transformer or balun 190 is shown as<br>
transformer Tl, 190 . As indicated in the schematic (the physical connection not<br>
explicitly shown), the transformed, balanced input signal has a positive input 210 and<br>
a negative input 212 that is split to the correspondingly labeled inputs of the amplifier.<br>
Specifically, the positive input 210 is connected to the "+" phase gates of the<br>
appropriate transistor of each push pull amplifier and the "-" phase input 212 is<br>
connected to the "-" phase gates of the appropriate transistor of each push pull<br>
amplifier. The prototype also implemented the twisted input loop design shown in<br>
FIG. 6 for the input power splitting.<br>
In measuring the performance of the design, the chip was glued directly to a<br>
gold plated brass heat sink using conductive adhesive to allow sufficient thermal<br>
dissipation. The chip ground pads were wire bonded to the heat sink. The input and<br>
output were wire bonded to 50 O microstrip lines on a printed circuit board (PCB).<br>
The supply and gate bias pads were also wire bonded. The input was driven using a<br>
commercial power amplifier connected to the circuit input through a directional<br>
coupler to measure the input return loss. The output was connected to a power meter<br>
through a 20 dB attenuator and 2.9 GHz low pass filter to avoid measuring harmonic<br>
signal powers. All system power losses were calibrated out, including the connector<br>
and Duroid board losses. The bond wire power loss was included in the amplifier's<br>
measured performance.<br>
An output power of 2.2W at 2.4GHz was obtained with 8.5dB gain using a 2V<br>
power supply. The corresponding power added efficiency (PAE) was 31 % and the<br>
drain efficiency was 36%. When the output was taken differentially, a PAE of 41 %<br>
was achieved with Pout of 1.9W, gain of 8.7dB and drain efficiency of 48%. FIGS. 8<br>
and 9 show the gain and PAE vs. output power for 2V and 1V supplies, respectively.<br>
Small signal gain was 14dB and the input reflection coefficient was -9dB. The 3dB<br>
bandwidth was 510MHz centered at 2.44GHz. All harmonics up to 20GHz were<br>
more than 64dB below the fundamental. This chip demonstrated the viability and<br>
performance enhancements of the monolithic design of the present invention<br>
compared to conventional designs.<br>
The present invention defines a technique for monolithically combining the<br>
output power of active devices. Having thus described exemplary embodiments of<br>
the invention, it will be apparent that further alterations, modifications, and<br>
improvements will also occur to those skilled in the art. Further, it will be apparent<br>
that the present invention is not limited to CMOS technology, to any specific<br>
