				<td>HIGH EFFICIENCY REFRACTORYLESS KETTLE<br>
The present invention relates to a high efficiency method and apparatus<br>
for calcining gypsum and/or drying gypsum.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Calcining of gypsum comprises converting calcium sulfate dihydrate by<br>
heating itinto calcium sulfate hemihydrate, better known as stucco. Prior<br>
calcining apparatus and methods have taken various forms. Traditionally, the<br>
calcining of gypsum has occurred in a large kettle, having a thickened domeshaped<br>
bottom, against which a gas-fired flame is directed, with the kettle and<br>
burner flame being enclosed in a suitable refractory structure. There is usually<br>
an associated hot pit into which the calcined material is fed. The kettle must<br>
withstand temperatures in the 2,000° -2,400°F range, hence requiring expensive<br>
fire box steel plate on its domed bottom, which was typically 1 3/4 inches thick.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,509 typifies mis type construction. This approach had<br>
numerous disadvantages, such as the extreme waste of hot burner gases, and the<br>
associated refractory brick enclosure which, when repairs or kettle shut-down<br>
were needed, first required a lengthy cool-down period.<br>
Other calcining kettles, of the general type described above, have<br>
included supplemental submerged combustion designs where exhaust gases<br>
from the gas-fired burners were discharged directly into the kettle contents.<br>
Here, the gas flame directly impinged against the material being calcined, and<br>
there was an increased possibility of creating so-called "dead burn" material,<br>
i.e., insoluble anhydrite. U.S. Pat Nos. 4,176,157 and 4,238,238 typify that<br>
type approach. Additionally, other prior art calcining kettles, of the general<br>
type described above, included a series of cross burner tubes which passed<br>
generally horizontally completely through the kettle, allowing the hot gases<br>
within the refractory structure and surrounding the kettle to be supplementally<br>
directed through the tubes, and thus, through the kettle contents to further heat<br>
the same. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,307,915 and 4,163,390 typify this type kettle<br>
construction. There have also been horizontally-aligned, rotary calcining<br>
structures; U.S. Pat. No. 3,871,829 typifies this type approach.<br>
Besides the above kettle constructions which normally require expensive<br>
refractory structure, there have also been refractoryless kettles using the<br>
submerged combustion principle, including those having auxiliary draft tube<br>
structure encompassing the main burner tube, so as to reduce formation of deadburned<br>
insoluble anhydrite. U.S. Pat No. 4,626,199 typifies this type<br>
construction. Additionally, mere are so-called refractoryless conical kettles<br>
with various types of submerged combustion heating systems, again with the<br>
attendant risk of creating non-uniform stucco and dead burn material U.S. Pat<br>
Nos. 4,629,419 and 4,744,961 typify such conical kettle constructions. More<br>
recent calcining kettle modifications have included so-called "boost" burner<br>
constructions, including electrical boost calrods, see U.S. Pat No. 4,744,963,<br>
and gas-fired boost burner designs, both added as supplemental heaters to<br>
traditional refractory-type kettle constructions.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,743,954 and 5,927,968 disclose a method and<br>
apparatus for the continuous calcining of gypsum material in a refractoryless<br>
kettle preferably healed by a multiple series of separate immersion tube coils,<br>
each coil operating within a specific calcining zone inside the kettle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides for an apparatus for calcining gypsum having a<br>
housing with a bottom wall, an open top, and a plurality of side walls extending<br>
between the bottom wall and the open top. A fixture is attached to the housing<br>
for receiving raw gypsum from a source and transferring the gypsum into the<br>
housing. The apparatus further includes at least one burner connected to the<br>
housing and operable for combusting an air-fuel mixture to heat the gypsum. At<br>
least one serpentine burner conduit extends from the burner through the housing<br>
and terminates through an upper surface of a support floor operable for holding<br>
the gypsum in the housing. The gypsum is first heated through conduction heat<br>
transfer from the burner conduit and is further heated by the exhaust gas that reenters<br>
the gypsum from the bottom of the apparatus. The exhaust gas fluidizes<br>
the gypsum as part of the calcining process.<br>
The apparatus may include an agitation mechanism operable for<br>
ensuring good fluidization of the powdered gypsum. The apparatus is operable<br>
for preventing channeling of exhaust gas through the gypsum, preventing dead<br>
zones in the gypsum, and forpreventing the gypsum from collecting along the<br>
surface of the gypsum support floor. The agitation mechanism includes an<br>
agitator frame and a plurality of agitation members connected thereto. The<br>
agitation mechanism is operable for agitating the gypsum adjacent the support<br>
floor when the agitator frame is reciprocally moved from a first position to a<br>
second position. The agitator frame has at least one pivotal support arm that is<br>
pivotally attached to the calcining apparatus on one end and to the frame at the<br>
other end such that the frame will swing about a pivot axis when the motion is<br>
imparted to the frame. An actuator arm extends through the side of the housing<br>
to provide a mechanical connection between an actuator and the agitator frame.<br>
A method for calcining gypsum includes providing gypsum to a calcining<br>
apparatus. The gypsum is first heated via conduction with a serpentine burner<br>
conduit extending from an external burner through the gypsum and terminating<br>
through a surface of the gypsum support floor. The exhaust gas is directed<br>
through a fluidization pad to fluidize and further heat the gypsum via<br>
convection as the exhaust gas flows through the gypsum and out the top of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
Other applications of the present invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art when the following description of the best mode<br>
contemplated for practicing the invention is read in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, an apparatus 10 for calcining gypsum is shown<br>
therein. A housing 12 includes a bottom wall 14, an open top 16, and a plurality<br>
of side walls 18 extending between the bottom wall 14 and the open top 16. An<br>
inlet fixture 20 is located on the housing 12 for receiving crushed or synthetic<br>
raw gypsum from a source (not shown) and for transferring the gypsum into the<br>
housing 12. At least one burner 22 is connected to the housing 12. The burner<br>
22 is operable for combusting an air-fuel mixture supplied by a forced air<br>
conduit 24 and a fuel conduit 26, The burner 22 can be any type known to those<br>
skilled in the art, but will typically burn a hydrocarbon based fuel. The heated<br>
exhaust from the burner 22 will flow through at least one serpentine shaped<br>
burner conduit 28 that extends through a gypsum support floor 23 adjacent the<br>
bottom wall 14 of the housing 12. The hot exhaust flow from the burner 22 is<br>
utilized to heat the gypsum material to approximately 300°F. In known manner,<br>
the heating process converts the gypsum into calcium sulfate hemihydrate, or<br>
stucco. Alternatively, the heating process can simply heat wet synthetic<br>
gypsum to a desired temperature, typically below 300°F in order to dry excess<br>
moisture from the wet synthetic gypsum for subsequent calcination in a separate<br>
process. Alternatively, the heating process can perform the drying and<br>
calculation processes in the same vessel.<br>
The burner conduit 28 advantageously includes an elongate linear<br>
portion 30 extending away from the burner 22. The linear portion increases the<br>
life span of the burner conduit 28. That is, if the flames from the burner 22<br>
were to directly impinge the burner conduit 28 along a curved or angled portion,<br>
the flames would overheat the side wall of the conduit causing high stress which<br>
shortens the life of the conduit 28. However, due to the presence of the initial<br>
elongated linear burner section 30 (which can extend some fifteen to twenty feet<br>
hi a commercial installation), the burner flames do not directly impinge on the<br>
burner conduit, and this is because the flames have converted, along the length<br>
of section 30, to hot exhaust gases. Importantly, the burner conduit 28 includes<br>
a plurality of curved sections 32 to connect the linear portions 30,31, and 33,<br>
provide the serpentine shape. The burner conduit 28 may include at least one<br>
reduced diameter section 34 to provide increased exhaust flow velocity to<br>
thereby enhance the heat transfer effectiveness of the conduit 28. The<br>
temperature of the exhaust cools proportionally to the distance it moves away<br>
from the burner 22, therefore the velocity may be increased to maintain a<br>
suitable heat transfer rate. The burner conduit 28 can also include a multiconduit<br>
portion 36 wherein a plurality of relatively smaller diameter conduhs 38<br>
are formed to be in fluid communication with relatively larger single conduit<br>
portions 32. The smaller diameter conduits 38 provide more surface area for a<br>
given effective flow area and thus increase the heat transfer relative to the larger<br>
conduit 32. The multi-conduit portions 36 can be connected to the single<br>
conduit portions 32 through various means known to those skilled in the art<br>
such as welding, brazing, and press fit, mechanical fasteners, etc. The burner<br>
conduit 28 can be attached to the burner 22 via a flange 40 with a plurality of<br>
threaded fasteners 42. The burner conduit 28 likewise can be attached at the<br>
discharge end 44 to an outlet conduit 46 that extends through the support floor<br>
23. The burner conduit 28 can be attached to the outlet conduit 46 via a flange<br>
48 with a plurality of threaded fasteners SO.<br>
A fluidization base 52, shown in Figs. 1,2,4, and 6 (best seen in Fig. 2)<br>
can be positioned in a lower portion of die housing 12 to receive exhaust flow<br>
from the burner conduit 28. The fluidization base 52 has a.plurality of sidewalls<br>
53 extending upwardly from a bottom 55. The fluidization base 52 can have a<br>
fluidization pad 54 positioned above the bottom 55 of the fluidization base 52.<br>
The fluidization pad 54 forms at least a portion of the support floor 23 of the<br>
housing 12. The fluidization pad 54 is operable for containing the gypsum<br>
product along the lower portions of housing 12, and for evenly distributing the<br>
exhaust flow as it passes from the fluidization base 52 directly into the gypsum.<br>
The fluidization base 52 delivers the aeration, the agitation ensures good<br>
fluidization especially of cohesive powders that will not otherwise fluidize. The<br>
fluidization pad 54 includes first and second outer perforated plates 56,58. The<br>
plates 56,58 include a plurality of through apertures 57 that permit the exhaust<br>
flow to pass therethrough. A bore hole 59 is formed in the fluidization pad 54<br>
to provide access for the conduit 46 (see Fig. 1) to pass through and deliver the<br>
exhaust flow to the fluidization base 52. At least one intermediate porous layer<br>
60, formed of a porous fiber mat or woven stainless steelmedia, is positioned<br>
between the outer plates 56,58. The intermediate layer 60 of media can be<br>
made from compressed silica fiber, woven stainless steel meshor similar<br>
materials suitable for fluidization as known to those skilled in the art to<br>
withstand high exhaust gas temperatures. The perforated plates 56,58 are most<br>
preferably made from a metal such as stainless steel or the like. The<br>
fluidization pad 54 operates by allowing diffused exhaust gas to bubble out<br>
through the generally evenly spaced apertures 57 of perforated plate 56. One<br>
advantage to using woven stainless steel media 60 is that the perforated plates<br>
56, 58 are not required except to provide support and protection for the media<br>
from punctures.<br>
An agitation mechanism 62, shown in Figs. 1,3,4, and 6 (best seen in<br>
Fig. 3), can be positioned just above the fluidization pad 54. The agitation<br>
mechanism 62 includes an agitator frame 64 having a pair of side beams 65.<br>
The agitator frame 64 has a plurality of agitation members 66 connected to die<br>
agitator frame 64 for agitating the gypsum product adjacent the fluidization pad<br>
54 along the support floor 23. In one embodiment, the agitation members 66 can<br>
take the form of a cross bar pattern. The agitation mechanism 62 locally churns<br>
the heated gypsum product when the agitator frame 64 is set into motion. At<br>
least one pivotal support arm 68 pivotally connects the agitation frame 64 to the<br>
housing 12 (shown in Fig. 1). The connection to the housing 12 can be formed<br>
with an angle plate 70 affixed to the housing 12 in a suitable manner such as by<br>
welding or mechanically fastening, etc. The support arm 68 can be secured to<br>
the angle plate 70 via a threaded fastener 72 or the like. The pivotal support<br>
arm 68 is most preferably a cable or similar structure to more easily facilitate a<br>
swinging motion by the agitator frame 64 about a common pivot axis when<br>
motion is imparted to the agitator frame 64. Alternate moving patterns by the<br>
agitator frame 64 are contemplated by the present invention. For example, one<br>
skilled in the art would readily understand how to impart motion to the agitator<br>
frame 64 in a vertical, horizontal, or arcute pattern, or any combination thereof.<br>
An actuation power source, such as an electric motor or pneumatic air<br>
cylinder 74, can be connected to the agitator frame 64 through an actuator arm<br>
76. An expandable seal 78 is engaged with the actuator arm 76 and the housing<br>
12 (not shown in Fig. 2) to prevent gypsum product from leaking out of the<br>
housing 12 about me actuator arm. The seal 78 expands and contracts as me<br>
actuator arm 76 moves between first and second positions as the agitator frame<br>
64 swings. Alternatively, the actuator arm 76 can be connected to mechanically<br>
leveraged linkages (not shown) that can extend from an actuation power source<br>
(not shown) positioned at the top of the housing 12 down to the agitator frame<br>
64 as is known to those skilled in the art The seal 78 can be made from any<br>
suitable material that can withstand temperatures greater man 300 degrees<br>
Fahrenheit and pressures up to 10 psig (pounds per square inch gage).<br>
Referring again to Fig. 1, an overflow tube 80 is flutdically connected to<br>
me housing 12 to allow processed gypsum to egress from the housing 12 into<br>
the overflow tube 80. An overflow valve 82 is associated with the overflow<br>
tube 80 to prevent gypsum from egressing from the housing 12 prior to being<br>
heated to a predetermined condition. A dump port 84 includes a dump valve 86<br>
that permits the selective draining of the contents in the housing 12. The valves<br>
82, 86 can be of any type known to those skilled in the art, but are most<br>
preferably electrically or pneumaticallyactuated.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, a conduit support 88 is slidingly connected to<br>
the housing 12 for supporting the burner conduit 28 during installation. The<br>
support 88 is operable for sliding between an outer position at least partially<br>
external to the housing 12 (shown in Fig. 4) and the installed position inside the<br>
housing 12. The conduit support 88 holds the conduit during installation and<br>
removal from the housing 12. The support 88 includes a pair of side rails 90,92<br>
slidingly connected to slide elements 91 formed on parallel walls 18 of the<br>
housing 12. A plurality of cross-bars 94 extend between the side rails 90,92 to<br>
provide support surfaces for the burner conduit 28 to rest thereon. The housing<br>
12 includes a side panel 96 operable to open when installing the burner conduit<br>
28. A plurality of ties 97 structurally connects the side walls 18 of the housing<br>
12 to one another to prevent outward bowing of the walls 18 when the housing<br>
12 is filled with gypsum. The ties 97 can be welded or otherwise affixed by any<br>
means that is conventional.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, the apparatus 10 includes access panels 98<br>
located on the side of the housing 12 for permitting servicing of the internal<br>
components, such as the burner 22 and the conduit 28, etc. A disengagement<br>
chamber 100 is positioned above the open top 16 of the housing 12 and is<br>
constructed to permit access thereto for servicing internal components of the<br>
housing 12. A dust collector 102 can be positioned above the disengagement<br>
chamber 100 to collect gypsum dust particles and recycle the particles back into<br>
the housing 12 for calcining. The dust collector 102 can include a plurality of<br>
replaceable filters 104. The filters 104 can be of any desired type such as round<br>
cartridge fitters, bag filters, or the like. The filters 104 can be periodically<br>
cleaned by intermittently injecting air through an opposite side of where the<br>
dust is collected or by shaking as is known to those skilled in the artAn exhaust<br>
stack 106 permits the exhaust to be removed from the apparatus 10 after the<br>
gypsum dust particles have been removed by the filters 104.<br>
In operation, gypsum powder is fed into an inlet fixture 20 to fill the<br>
housing 12. Air and fuel are supplied by the conduits 24,26 respectively, to the<br>
burner 22. The burner 22 combusts the air-fuel mixture and provides hot<br>
exhaust gases which flow in the direction of the arrows shown hi Fig. 6. The<br>
exhaust flows through the serpentine burner conduit 28 into the fluidization<br>
base 52. From the fluidization base 52, the exhaust flows horizontally and then<br>
upwardly through the fluidization pad 54 positioned above the base 52. The<br>
fluidization pad 54 distributes the exhaust gases through the gypsum product so<br>
that the heated exhaust gases ate evenly distributed there through. The outer<br>
surface of the burner conduit 28 provides heat to the gypsum through<br>
conduction heat transfer. Thus, the gypsum product is heated both when the<br>
exhaust gas flows through the burner conduit 28 and through the gypsum after<br>
traveling through the fluidization pad 54. The present invention provides for<br>
increased fuel efficiency over the prior art because the dual heating method<br>
removes the maximum amount of heat from the exhaust and transfers it into the<br>
gypsum. Exhaust gas continues to flow upwardly through the disengagement<br>
chamber 100 permitting some of the gypsum particles to separate from me<br>
exhaust flow and fall back into the housing 12. The dust collector 102 cleans<br>
the airborne gypsum particles from the exhaust gas before exhaust gas egresses<br>
through the exhaust stack 106. The gypsum particles can periodically be<br>
knocked from the collector filter cartridges (or bags) back into the bed of<br>
gypsum.<br>
Advantageously, an agitation mechanism 62 is provided to ensure good<br>
fluidization by preventing exhaust from channeling directly through gypsum<br>
powder. Natural gypsum typically includes a fine powder that may be too<br>
cohesive to achieve good fluidization without agitation. The agitation<br>
mechanism 62 is operated by swinging between first and second positions to<br>
locally mix the gypsum and scrape it away from the fluidized pad 54. The<br>
calcining apparatus 10 has a high efficiency because substantially all of the heat<br>
produced by the burner 22 is utilized in heating the gypsum and is not lost<br>
through the exhaust process. The temperature of the exhaust gas leaving the<br>
gypsum product is approximately 300°F, which is the approximate temperature<br>
required for the gypsum to be processed into stucco. Synthetic gypsum mat is<br>
manufactured with a standard particle size may not require agitation to ensure<br>
good fluidization.<br>
