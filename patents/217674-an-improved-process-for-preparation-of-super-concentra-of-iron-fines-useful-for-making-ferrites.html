				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful for making ferrites.<br>
High quality iron oxide having low silica, alumina and calcia has great demand for making different grade of ferrites. India has vast reserves of iron ore and considerable amount of this is exported to several countries. Large amount of iron ore fines are generated during mining. Utilisation of the iron ore fines for making value added products like soft ferrites has been of great importance, particularly because of the fact that the iron oxide required by soft ferrite industry can safely use beneficiated iron ore of desired specification in order to achieve desirable magnetic properties in the final product.<br>
In the hitherto known dry process (Lamb F.D and Woodard D.A. Pilot-plant production of high grade Magnetic concentrates. Cranberry N.C U.S Bur. Mines. Report No. Inv. 3980 December 1946 pp.7) which uses magnetic separation technique on wilfley tables to remove silica.<br>
In another hitherto known acid leaching process (C.V Firth 'Method of producing iron oxide for production of iron oxide powder', U.S Patent 2,413,492 December 31, 1946) which involves dissolution of iron in mineral acid, precipitation of iron hy¬droxide from acid solution and subsequent calcination of iron hydroxide producing pure iron oxide.<br>
Yet another process (T.D. Tiemann 'Extraction of Silica from Low Grade Siliceous Iron Ore by Digestion in Sodium Hydroxide<br>
Solution' Trans. Soc. Min. Eng. AIME 232 (1965) pp.307-308) where sodium hydroxide solution was used to dissolve silica and alumina from the iron ores.<br>
The hitherto known process have the following drawbacks :<br>
In the physical beneficiation process, the silica level in the super concentrate can not be brought down below 0.5% and the super concentrate produced is not suitable for making ferrites.<br>
In the acid leaching process, acid consuming gange materials also go in solution along with iron and the solution needs puri¬fication. The number of unit operation is more. The high cost of the process defeats the commercial application. Moreover, the process corrodes the processing equipments.<br>
The caustic leaching process alone cannot bring down the silica content below 0.5% and final product (super concentrate) is not suitable for ferrite making.<br>
Therefore, R&amp;D efforts have been done to develop an economic and viable process to produce high quality iron oxide from iron ore fines to be used for making soft ferrites.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful for making ferrites, particularly soft ferrites.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful<br>
for making ferrites whereby processing cost is reduced.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful for making ferrites whereby super concentrate is produced with minimum loss of iron value.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful for making ferrites whereby costly chemical such as sodium hydroxide is recovered and recycled and thereby reducing the cost of production.<br>
In the process of the present invention iron ore fines containing impurities like silica, alumina, calcia etc. are subjected to leaching in caustic solution under temperature and pressure where silica and alumina etc. present in the iron ore fines are chemically reacted with caustic solution such as caus¬tic soda, caustic potash producing water soluble slicate and aluminate etc. leaving the unreacted iron oxide in the residue. The chemical reactions occuring during caustic leaching may represent as below:<br>
-2      +<br>
SiO2   + 2H2 O  + 4MOH  =  Si (OH)     + 4M  + 2OH    	 (1)<br>
	6<br>
Al2 03 + 2MOH  =  2M AlO2   + H O		 (2)<br><br>
where M represents alkali metal.<br>
After leaching, the solid/liquid separation is done by decanta-tion. The iron containing residue is repeatedly washed with water to free it from alkali and entrapped soluble salts. After<br>
final washing, the product is further leached in dilute acid solution such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid solution at ambient temperature where unreacted silica left in caustic leaching is gone in solution. After wash leaching the solid is separated by filtration and dried. The super concentrate thus produced can be used for making soft ferrites.<br>
After alkali leaching treatment, the leach liquor is further processed for recovery of pure caustic solution by conventional processes. The recovered caustic solution can be recycled.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for super concentration of iron ore fines useful for making ferrites which comprises :<br>
i)         leaching the  iron ore fines  in  caustic solution  of strength varying from 10 to 30% at a temperature in the range of 150-240°C for a period of 1 to 6 hours, ii)       decanting   the   leach   solution   obtained   in   step   (i)   and<br>
subsequent filtering for solid/liquid separation, iii)      washing the solid iron concentrate thoroughly obtained from<br>
step (ii) with water to remove alkali,<br>
iv)      wash-leaching  the  caustic  leached   residue  obtained  from step   (iii)   in   acid   solution   such   as   dilute   hydrofluoric, hydrochloric acid solution having strength of 2 to 5%, v)        filtering the slurry by known methods to obtain solid super<br>
concentrate, vi)      washing the solid super concentrate with water to remove<br>
acid for 15 to 30 minutes,<br>
vii)      drying the above said super concentrate at a temperature of 150 to 265°C for a period of 4 to 6 hours.<br>
vii) Drying the super concentrate.<br>
According to a feature of this invention, the iron ore fines employed may be selected from iron ore fines having the following composition range :<br>
Fe O3     -    75.5      -    85.9% 2<br>
5.9 	20.4% <br>
62.0 	69.0% <br>
2.5 	10.6% <br>

CaO       -     0.02     -     0.03% MgO       -     0.04     -     0.06%<br>
The caustic salts used for leaching of iron ore fines may be of commercial grade. Strength of caustic solution used forleach-ing may vary from 10 to 30%. The pulp density of slurry may vary from 1.45 to 1.75 gm/cc. The temperature of leaching may vary from 150 to 240oC and pressure may vary from 25 to 40 kg/cm2. Time of leaching may vary from 1 to 6 hours.<br>
The hydrofluoric/hydrochloric acid used for wash leaching may be of commercial grade. Strength of acid solution used for wash leaching may vary from 2 to 5%. The solid/liquid ratio for wash leaching may vary from 1:2 to 1:5 (w/v) and time of wash leaching may vary from 15 to 30 minutes.<br>
The super concentrate produced may be dried at a temperature in the range of 150 to 265oC for period of 4 to 6 hours.<br>
According to feature of this invention, the leach-liquor produced on pressure leaching contains free caustic hydroxide and soluble silicate of sodium, potasium, calcium which on further processing by conventional process produce pure caustic hydroxide to be used for recycling.<br>
By the process of present invention most of silica and alumina are removed and iron oxide of 99.8% purity is produced which is suitable for making soft ferrites.<br>
