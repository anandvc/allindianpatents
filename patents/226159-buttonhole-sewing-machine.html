				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Reference is made to Patent Application No.212/KOL/2003 dated 8th April 2003 titled "CNC<br>
Controlled Buttonhole Sewing Machine".<br>
The invention relates to a buttonhole sewing machine, comprising a needle which is drivable in<br>
up and down reciprocation, an x-y table, which is displaceable by an x drive in an x direction and<br>
by a y drive in a y direction, and which supports at least a work piece clamp and a buttonhole<br>
sewing device, which is substantially disposed downstream of the needle in the y direction, which<br>
comprises a cutter with a knife, which comprises a cutting block unit of several cutting blocks,<br>
one of which at a time being movable into a position of cooperation with the knife, and which is<br>
provided with a cutting drive.<br>
A buttonhole sewing machine of the generic type is known from DE 199 16 660 C1<br>
(corresponding to US 6 220 192 B1). In this case, a knife is stationarily, but replaceably mounted<br>
on the base plate of the sewing machine. Several cutting blocks are mounted above the knife on<br>
a rotary support that is drivable in up and down reciprocation; the cutting blocks can be moved<br>
around an axis that extends in the y direction selectively into a position in which a cutting block<br>
cooperates with the knife. Pivoting the cutting blocks and setting the support in a given position<br>
of a cutting block needs extensive constructional requirements.<br>
It is an object of the invention to embody a buttonhole sewing machine of the generic type such<br>
that the constructional requirements for the cutting device are as little as possible.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained through provision of an anvil which supports at<br>
least two cutting blocks that are adjustable in the x direction and are stationarily joined to the<br>
sewing machine and the knife is movable from above against the anvil.<br>
By a linear motion which can be extremely short, only extending over the width of a cutting<br>
block, the cutting blocks can selectively be moved into a position in which they engage with the<br>
knife which is only movable in a straight line. The anvil is mounted on the base plate, having only<br>
a single support that is movable only in a single direction, namely the x direction, whereas the<br>
knife only makes a vertical linear motion.<br><br>
 Details of the invention will become apparent from the ensuing description<br>
of a exemplary embodiment, taken in conjunction with thai drawing, in<br><br>
which<br>

tion corresponding to Fig. 3;<br>
Fig. 11 is a plan view of an anvil suited to the knife of Fig. 10 in an illus-<br>

Fig. 12 is a diagrammatic view of a cutting drive for the buttonhole cutting<br>
device, including the linkage in circuit with the control unit; and<br>
Fig. 13 is a diagrammatic view of another embodiment of the cutting drive<br>
of the buttonhole cutting device, including the linkage in circuit<br>
with the control unit.<br>
As seen in Fig. 1, a buttonhole sewing machine is C-shaped, having a top<br>
arm 1, a bottom base plate 2 in the form of a casing and an approximately<br>
vertical standard 3 that unites the two. An arm shaft 4 is conventionally<br>
lodged in the arm 1; it is drivable by a motor 5 which is only roughly out-<br>
lined in Fig. 7. The actuation of a vertically displaceable needle bar 6 with<br>
a needle 7 and a jogging drive therefor are customarily derived from the<br>
arm shaft 4.<br>
Disposed on the base plate 2 is an x-y table 8 which is a cross slide that is<br>
movable in two horizontal coordinate directions, namely the x and the y<br>
direction. The x-y table 8 is of conventional design as known for example<br>
from DE 198 07 771 C1 (corresponding to US 6 095 066 A). Actuation of<br>
the x-y table 8 takes place by drives roughly outlined in Fig. 7, namely an x<br><br>
drive 9 and a y drive 10, which are electric positioning motors, preferably<br>
stepper motors, or variable speed D.C. motors.<br>
A two-piece supporting plate 11a, 11b is disposed on the x-y table 8. One<br>
of the two sectional supporting plates 1 la or 1 lb can be supported on the<br>
x-y table 8 for displacement in the x direction, whereas the other sectional<br>
supporting plate 11b or 11a is non-displaceably fixed on the x-y table 8,<br>
which is not shown in detail.<br>
A work piece clamp 12a and 12b is mounted on each sectional supporting<br>
plate 11a and 11b, having a sectional bearing plate 13a and 13b which is<br>
mounted on the respective sectional supporting plate 11a and 11b, with a<br>
clamping plate 14a and 14b being allocated thereto. The clamping plates<br>
14a, 14b are mounted on double-armed bearing levers 15a, 15b.<br>
Details of the structure and operation of the work piece clamps 12a, 12b<br>
can be taken from DE 102 16 809 C1, to which reference is made in this<br>
regard.<br>
Downstream of the needle bar 6, seen in the y direction, provision is made<br>
for a buttonhole cutting device 16 which substantially consists of an upper,<br>
drivable cutter 17 and a lower anvil 18. The upper cutter 17 has a cutting<br>
drive 19, details of which will be described below; one end of the cutting<br>
drive 19 is fixed in the base plate 2 by means of a joint 20. The other top<br>
end of the drive 19 is connected to a double-armed lever 21 by means of a<br>
joint 22, the lever 21 being articulated by another joint 21a to a driving rod<br>
23 which is vertically displaceable in at least one guide bearing 24 that is<br>
mounted on the arm 1. The lower end of the driving rod 23 is provided<br>
with a knife head 25, to the bottom side of which a knife 26. seen in Fig. 3,<br><br>
is replaceably attached. As seen in Fig. 3, the knife 26 has a straight cutting<br>
edge 27 and an eye cutting edge 28. The straight cutting edge 27 has a<br>
length L27, whereas the entire knife 26 has a length L26, comprising the<br>
straight cutting edge 27 and the eye cutting edge 28.<br>
The anvil 18 has a base body 29 fixed in the base plate 2. A support 30 is<br>
disposed on the base body 29; it is displaceable in the x direction. It is held<br>
by strips 31, 32 on the base body 29, the strips 31, 32 being fixed to the<br>
base body 29 by screws 33. A displacement drive 34 is integrated in the<br>
base body 29, which is a piston-cylinder drive pneumatically actuated on<br>
two sides. The cylinder 35 is formed by a drilled hole in the base body 29<br>
which runs in the x direction and the ends of which are closed by covers<br>
36. A piston 37 is displaceable in the cylinder 35, with a line 38, 39 opening<br>
into the cylinder 35 on each front end of the piston 37 and serving for<br>
compressed air supply and evacuation. The support 30 is joined to the piston<br>
37 by means of a bolt 3 la; it is moved by the piston 37 in the x direction,<br>
depending on whether the piston 37 is actuated by compressed air via<br>
the line 38 or 39. The two shifting motions are defined by adjustable stops<br>
40, 41 which are formed by set-screws arranged in the base body 29.<br>
A first cutting block 42 and a second cutting block 43 are replaceably fixed<br>
by screws 44 on the support 30. As apparent from a combination of Fig. 3<br>
and Fig. 6, when the first cutting block 42 is underneath the knife 26, cooperating<br>
there-with, the entire knife 26, i.e. the straight cutting edge 27 and<br>
the eye cutting edge 28, is in engagement with the cutting block 42. When<br>
the second cutting block 43 is underneath the knife 26, only the straight<br>
cutting edge 27 will engage there-with; the eye cutting edge 28 does not<br>
cut. The area of the second cutting block 43 that is allocated to the eye cut-<br>
ting edge is provided with a recess 43a.<br><br>
Actuating the displacement drive 34 and thus shifting the support 30 into<br>
one of the two stop positions, in which either the first cutting block 42 is<br>
underneath the knife 26 or the second cutting block 43 is underneath the<br>
knife 26, takes place by a compressed-air source (not shown) via an electromagnetically<br>
operated multiple-way valve 45.<br>
The sewing machine is provided with a control unit 46 by which to trigger<br>
the x drive 9, the y drive 10, the multiple-way valve 45 for the displacement<br>
drive 34, the driving motor 5 of the arm shaft 4, clamping drives (not<br>
shown) for the work piece clamps 12a, 12b and the cutting drive 19. The<br>
control unit 46 comprises a memory unit 47. Further provision is made for<br>
an operating unit 48 with a keyboard 49 and a display 50.<br>
The mode of operation will become apparent from Figs. 8 and 9. After a<br>
work piece 52 has been provided with an eye-type buttonhole seam 51, the<br>
work piece 52 is transported by the x-y table 8 in the y direction into the<br>
cutting device 16. The first cutting block 42 is underneath the knife 26. The<br>
cutting drive 19 is operated. The entire knife 26 cooperates for cutting with<br>
the first cutting block 42 which forms a mating surface so that the straight<br>
cutting edge 27 and the eye cutting edge 28 cut an eye-type buttonhole 53<br>
of a length L26.<br>
If however a simple buttonhole has been sewn that has stitched transverse<br>
locks instead of an eye, a so-called linen buttonhole, then the second cutting<br>
block 43 is moved under the knife 26 by corresponding actuation of<br>
the displacement drive 34. The work piece 52 with the buttonhole seam 54<br>
is moved over the second cutting block 43. By actuation of the cutting<br><br>
drive 19, only the straight cutting edge 27 of the knife is in contact with the<br>
cutting block 43. A straight buttonhole 55 of a length L27 is cut.<br>
An alternative will become apparent from Figs. 10 and 11. In this case, the<br>
knife 26' has a central straight cutting edge 27 and an eye cutting edge 28<br>
and 28' at each end thereof. The cutting blocks 42', 43' are designed in such<br>
a way that the first cutting block 42' is in contact with the straight cutting<br>
edge 27 and the eye cutting edge 28, whereas the second cutting block 43'<br>
is designed in such a way that it is in contact with the straight cutting edge<br>
27 and the eye cutting edge 28'. This embodiment enables eye-type buttonholes<br>
to be produced that vary in position.<br>
The cutting drive 19 in the embodiment according to Fig. 12 is substantially<br>
formed by y multichamber cylinder 56 which is fixed in the base<br>
plate 2 by means of the joint 20. Disposed in the cutting drive 19 is a piston<br>
57, the outer end of which is connected to the lever 21 via the joint 22. In<br>
the cylinder 56, a total of four chambers 58 to 61 are separated from each<br>
other by dividing walls 62, 63, 64, through which the piston rod 57 passes<br>
in a sealed manner. The chambers 58 to 61 are disposed one after the other<br>
over the length of the cylinder 56. A piston 65, 66, 67, 68 is disposed in<br>
each chamber; it is fixed to the piston rod 57 and sealed toward the cylinder<br>
56. The chambers 58, 59, 60, 61 and the pistons 65 to 68 constitute four<br>
spatially successive, active linear drives. The piston 65 in the first chamber<br>
58 is designed for bilateral actuation via lines 69, 70, meaning that the piston<br>
rod can be actuated in the direction of extension 71 or in the direction<br>
of retraction 72, depending on the type of actuation.<br>
The other three chambers 59, 60, 61 are actuated by a joint line 73 in such<br>
a way that a force in the direction of extension 71 is exercised on the piston<br><br>
rod 57. The three lines 69, 70, 73 are actuated by three multiple-way valves<br>
74, 75, 76, which are triggered by the control unit 46 via the operating unit<br>
48.<br>
All the pistons 65 to 68 and correspondingly also the chambers 58 to 61<br>
have an identical diameter; the pressure of the compressed air that is admitted<br>
via the valves 74 to 76 is the same so that, depending on actuation, the<br>
same force is exercised on the piston rod 57 by each actuated piston 65 to<br>
68. Consequently, a force of extension of on the whole four steps that is<br>
exercised on the piston rod 57 in the direction of extension 71, and thus a<br>
cutting power that is exercised on the knives 26 and 26', is effected in steps<br>
of 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent of the maximally possible force of extension.<br>
This takes place as follows:<br>
Upon action on only the piston 65 via the line 70 and the valve 75, the piston<br>
rod 57 is actuated in the direction of extension 71 by 25 percent of the<br>
maximally possible force of extension.<br>
Upon action on the pistons 66, 67, 68 and upon simultaneous action on the<br>
piston 65 via the line 69 and the valve 74, the piston rod 57 is actuated in<br>
the direction of extension 71 by 50 percent of the maximally possible force<br>
of extension. This results from the fact that, by action on the piston 65 via<br>
the line 69, a counteracting force is exerted on the piston rod 57 in the direction<br>
of retraction 72, partially compensating the forces that act on the<br>
pistons 66, 67, 68 in the direction of extension 71.<br>
If only the pistons 66, 67, 68 are actuated via the line 73 and the valve 76,<br>
then a force acts on the piston rod 57 in the direction of extension 71,<br>
amounting to 75 percent of the totally possible force of extension.<br><br>
If the piston 65 is actuated via the line 70 and the multiple-way valve 75<br>
and the pistons 66 to 68 are simultaneously actuated via the line 73 and the<br>
valve 76, then 100 percent of the overall possible force of extension act on<br>
the piston rod 57.<br>
For retraction of the piston rod 57 i.e., for lifting the knife 26, 26' off the<br>
anvil 18 after a cutting operation, solely the piston 65 is actuated via the<br>
line 69 and the valve 74, the two other lines 70, 73 are evacuated.<br>
In keeping with the alternative of the cutting drive 19' according to Fig. 13,<br>
provision is made for a piston-cylinder drive 77 that is pneumatically actuated<br>
bilaterally and the cylinder 78 and piston rod 79 of which are incorporated<br>
in a toggle mechanism 80. This toggle mechanism 80 is linked with<br>
the lever 21 by the joint 22 and supported on a force limiter 81 by the joint<br>
20. The cylinder 78 is connected by way of a multiple-way valve 82 and<br>
two lines 83, 84 which discharge into the cylinder 78 at both ends of the<br>
piston 85 of the drive 77. Depending on the actuation of the piston 85 via<br>
one of the lines 83 or 84, the lever 21 is pivoted such that the cutting drive<br>
19' makes a cutting motion of the knife 26 and 26' or returns the knife 26,<br>
26' into its upper position of rest. Upon action on the piston 85 via the line<br>
83, the toggle mechanism 80 takes its expanded position, which results in a<br>
cutting motion whereas, upon actuation of the line 84, the knife 26, 26' is<br>
again lifted into its upper position of rest.<br>
Limiting the force that acts on the lever 21 and the knife 26 and 26' takes<br>
place by the force limiter 81 which comprises a four-storey abutment 86<br>
that supports itself stationarily i.e., immovably, in the base plate 2 by<br>
means of a stationary part 87. The stationary part 87 of the abutment 86<br><br>
bears a resilient part 88 which the toggle mechanism 80 supports itself on<br>
by the joint 20. The stationary part 87 is designed in the way of a frame,<br>
having four pneumatically actuated diaphragm cylinders 90, 91, 92, 93 one<br>
on top of the other as passive linear drives. The resilient part 88 of the<br>
abutment 86 also has intermediate bottoms 94 one on top of the other, one<br>
intermediate bottom 94 at a time being disposed above an intermediate bottom<br>
89. The diaphragm cylinders 90 to 93 are disposed in each case on an<br>
intermediate bottom 89 and below an intermediate bottom 94. Each diaphragm<br>
cylinder 90 to 93 has an internal stop 96 below its diaphragm 95<br>
i.e., in the interior. An external stop 97 is mounted on the diaphragm 95.<br>
The respective external stop 97 can be moved vertically by the respective<br>
diaphragm 95.<br>
In an unpressurized condition, the diaphragms 95 are in contact with the<br>
internal stops 96 whereas, upon actuation by compressed air, the external<br>
stops 97 bear by an edge 97a against a diaphragm cylinder cover 91a. Dimensioning<br>
is such that each diaphragm cylinder can perform only a short<br>
lifting motion of for example one to two millimeters.<br>
Compressed air is admitted to the diaphragm cylinders 91, 92, 93 via lines<br>
98, 99, 100 via multiple-way valves 101, 102, 103. The diaphragm cylinder<br>
90 is connected to the line 83 that acts on the drive 77.<br>
Depending on whether, upon action on the drive 77 in the cutting direction,<br>
only the simultaneously actuated diaphragm cylinder 90 is actuated or another<br>
one or two or three diaphragm cylinders 91 to 93, an abutment force<br>
is exercised via the joint 20 on the toggle mechanism 80. amounting to 25,<br>
50, 75 or 100 percent of the maximally possible abutment force. This again<br>
limits the force exercised on the lever 21.<br><br>
The range of forces applied can be given by a pressure regulator 104 which<br>
is also triggered via the operating unit 48. A similar pressure regulator may<br>
of course also be provided in the exemplary embodiment according to Fig.<br>
12. In the embodiment according to Fig. 13, triggering the valves 82, 101,<br>
102, 103 also takes place by way of the operating unit 48.<br>
The purpose of force graduation resides in adaptation of the cutting device<br>
16 to varying cutting conditions that are influenced by the hardness and<br>
type of work piece, the number of work piece layers that are to be cut, but<br>
also by the shape and/or size of the incision to be performed. In conclusion,<br>
adaptation of the cutting force helps create a flexible cutting device 16<br>
which can be adapted to the cutting conditions and in which the knife 26,<br>
26' and anvil 18 are protected against unnecessary wear by too high cutting<br>
forces, this meaning a considerable increase in readiness for service.<br><br>
