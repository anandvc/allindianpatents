				<td>The present invention relates to a 2-aryl-3-(pyrazin-2-ylaminosulphonyl) pyridine compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compounds and, more particularly, to novel N-heterocyclyl sulphonamides, and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess endothelin receptor antagonist activity. These compounds are of value whenever such antagonist activity is desired, such as for research tools within pharmacological, diagnostic and related studies or in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions including, but not limited to, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac or cerebral circulatory disease and renal disease, in warm-blooded animals (including man), in which elevated or abnormal levels of endothelin play a significant causative role. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions of the novel compounds (and their salts) for use in treating said diseases or medical conditions, and to processes for the manufacture of the novel compounds. The invention further relates to the use of the novel compounds in treating one or more of the said diseases or medical conditions. A method of treating one or more of the said diseases or medical conditions using said compounds is also provided.<br>
The endothelins are a family of endogenous 21 amino acid peptides comprising three isoforms, endothelin-1, endothelin-2 and endothelin-3. The endothelins are formed by cleavage of the Trp21-Val22 bond of their corresponding proendothelins by a putative endothelin converting enzyme. The endothelins are among the most potent vasoconstrictors known and have a characteristic long duration of action. They exhibit a wide range of other activities including cell proliferation and mitogenesis, extravasation and chemotaxis, and also interact with a number of other vasoactive agents. They also have direct effects on the heart. Thus the biological profile of the endothelins is consistent with a pathophysiological role in the cardiovascular system. The endothelins also have actions on other physiological systems including the airways, gastro-intestinal tract, reproductive system, kidney, liver, central nervous system, neuro-endocrine system and the blood.<br>
The endothelins are released from a range of tissue and cell sources including vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, kidney, liver, uterus, airways, intestine and leukocytes. Release can be stimulated by hypoxia, shear stress, physical injury and a wide range of hormones and cytokines. Elevated endothelin levels have been found in a number of<br><br>
disease states in man including hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, pre-eclampsia, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, acute and chronic renal failure, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolaemia, cardiogenic and endotoxic shock, diabetes mellitus, Raynaud's disease, scleroderma, systemic sclerosis, Buerger's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, acute respiratory failure, liver cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, certain cancers and after surgery.<br>
In European patent applications, publication nos. 558258 and 569193, and in International patent application, publication no. WO 94/27979, are described certain N-(isozaxolyl)sulphonamides and in European patent application, publication no. 640596 are described certain N-(pyridazinyl)sulphonamides, which are referred to as endpthelin receptor antagonists.<br>
Although a number of endothelin receptor antagonists are known, there is a continuing need for alternative antagonists. The present invention is based in part on this need and on our discovery of the unexpected antagonism of the endothelin receptor by certain N-heterocyclyl sulphonamides.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a heterocyclic compound of the formula la<br>

halogeno, cyano, carboxy and trifluoromethyl; or an N-oxide thereof; or a pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable salt thereof.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula I, or an N-oxide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined above, but excluding compounds and N-oxides thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in which Ar bears a (l-6C)alkylcarbony!oxy(l-6C)alkyl, N-(l-6C)alkylcarbamoyloxy(l-6C)alkyl, hydroxy(l-6C)aIkoxy, (2-6C)alkenyloxy(l-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxycarbonyl( 1 -6C)alkoxy-( 1 -6C)alkyl, carboxy( 1 -6C)alkoxy( 1 -6C)alkyl, hydroxy( 1 -6C)alkoxy(l-6C)alkyl, pyridyl-(l-6C)alkoxy(l-6C)alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted five membered heterocyclyl group containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, a substituted or unsubstituted six membered heterocyclyl group containing 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, or a morpholino or thiamorpholino ring; and excluding compounds and N-oxides thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein a phenyl or benzene moiety of a substituent on Ar bears a carboxy group.<br>
It will be appreciated that, depending on the nature of the substituents, certain of the formula I compounds may possess one or more chiral centres and may be isolated in one or more racemic or optically active forms. It-is to be understood that the present invention concerns any form of such a compound of formula I which possesses the afore-mentioned useful pharmacological properties, it being well known how to make optically active forms, for example by synthesis from suitable chiral intermediates or by resolution, and how to<br><br>
determine their pharmacological properties, for example by use of the tests described hereinafter.<br>
It will also be appreciated that a compound of formula I may exhibit polymorphism, that a compound of formula I may form a solvate and that a compound of formula I may exist in more than one tautomeric form. It is to be understood that the present invention also concerns any polymorphic form, any tautomer or any solvate, or any mixture thereof, which possesses endothelin receptor antagonist activity.<br>
It will further be appreciated that a compound of the formula I may be chemically modified such that in vivo it is converted into a parent compound of the formula I (for example, by hydrolytic, oxidative or enzymatic cleavage). Such chemically modified compounds are commonly referred to as prodrugs and may be, for example, metabolically labile ester or amide derivatives of a parent compound having a carboxylic acid group (or a metabolically labile ester of a parent compound having an hydroxy group). It is to be understood that the present invention also concerns any such prodrugs, including metabolically labile ester or amide derivatives of compounds of the formula I.<br>
It is further to be understood that generic terms such as "alky!" include both straight and branched chain variants when the carbon numbers permit.<br>
However, when a particular radical such as "propyl" is given, it is specific to the straight chain variant, branched chain variants such as "isopropyl" being specifically named when intended. The same convention applies to other radicals.<br>
It is further to be appreciated that the ring containing A1, A2, A3 and A4 is a pyridyl ring optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents B1 as defined herein. In those compounds in which there is more than one substituent B1 present (i.e. when m is 2 or 3), the value for each B1 may be the same or different. Also, when a substituent on Ar is a heterocyclyl group, it is attached to the ring containing A1, A2, A3 and A4 by a ring carbon of the heterocyclyl group.<br>

It will be appreciated that where sub-groups of compounds of<br>
the invention, or particular or preferred groups of compounds of the invention or specific compounds of the invention are referred to, these groups include prodrugs of said compounds, such as metabolically labile esters or amides.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, for example, salts with alkali metal (such as sodium, potassium or lithium), alkaline earth metals (such as calcium or magnesium), ammonium salts, and salts with organic bases affording physiologically acceptable cations, such as salts with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine and morpholine. In addition, for those compounds which are sufficiently basic, suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, pharmaceutically-acceptable acid-addition salts with hydrogen halides, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and with organic acids such as citric acid, maleic acid, methanesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid. Alternatively, the compounds of Formula I may exist in zwitterionic form.<br>
The compounds of Formula I may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry well known in the art for the production of structurally analogous compounds. Such procedures are provided as a further feature of the invention and include, by way of example, the following procedures in which the generic radicals have any of the values given above, unless stated otherwise.<br>
(a)       A compound of the Formula III in which P is a protecting group, is deprotected.<br>
A suitable protecting group P includes, for example, an (l-6C)alkoxycarbonyl group (such as methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or isobutoxycarbonyl), benzyloxycarbonyl (in which the benz ring may be optionally substituted, for example it may bear a halogeno, (l-4C)alkyl or (l-4C)alkoxy substituent), 2-methoxyethoxymethyl and tri-(l-4C)alkylsilylethoxymethyl (such as 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl). A protecting group P may be removed from the compound of Formula III by treatment with one or more<br>
deprotecting agents. It will be appreciated that the deprotecting agent or agents will depend on the particular value for P. Suitable deprotecting agents and procedures for their use are well known in the art. For example, an alkoxycarbonyl group may be removed under basic, conditions, such as sodium hydroxide or alkoxide (e.g. methoxide) in a suitable solvent such as methanol; a 2-methoxyethoxymethyl group may be removed using acidic conditions, such as hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such as ethanol; and a<br>
tri(l-4C)alkylsilylethoxymethyl group may be removed by using tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran, by using trifluoroacetic acid or by using a mixture of hydrochloric acid in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.<br>
A compound of the Formula III may be obtained by coupling a compound of the Formula IV where T is bromo, iodo, trifluoromethanesulphonyloxy or, if A1 or A3 is nitrogen, chloro, with an optionally substituted phenylboronic acid of the formula Ar.B(OH)2 (or an anhydride or ester thereof) in the presence of a suitable base and in the presence of a palladium (0), palladium (II), nickel (0) or nickel (II) catalyst.<br>
Suitable catalysts include, for example,tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(0), bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(n)chloride, nickel(II)chloride, bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(n)chloride, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and palladium(II)chloride.<br>
A suitable base fer use in the reaction is, for example, an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide, an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium or potassium carbonate, or an organic base such as tri(l-6C)alkylamine, for example, triethylamine.<br>
The coupling is generally performed in the presence of a suitable solvent of diluent, for example, a hydrocarbon, such as toluene or xylene, an ether, such as dioxan or tetrahydrofuran, an (l-4C)alcohol such as methanof, ethanol or-butanol, water, or mixtures thereof (for example, a mixture of toluene, ethanol and water).<br>
The reaction is generally performed at a temperature in the range, for example, 50-150°C, and conveniently at or about the reflux temperature of the solvent or mixture of solvents used.<br>
Alternatively, the coupling of a compound of Formula IV with Ar.B(OH)2 (or an anhydride or ester thereof) may be carried out using a source of fluoride ion under aqueous conditions, for example using potassium fluoride in a mixture of toluene and water under reflux.<br>
Compounds of Formula IV may be obtained, for example, by reacting a sulphonyl halide of the Formula V wherein Hal is a halogeno group (such as chloro, bromo or iodo) with an appropriately protected amine of the Formula VI wherein P is a protecting group, for example under basic conditions using sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Alternatively, a sulphonyl halide of the Formula V may be reacted with an amine of the Formula VII to give a compound of the Formula VIII which is then protected to give a compound of the Formula IV. The protecting group P is chosen so that it allows formation of the compound of formula IIl under the conditions described. Suitable protecting groups and procedures for use thereof are generally known in the art. The protection of an amine of formula VII or a compound of formula VIII may be carried out using standard pprocedures of organic chemistry. For example, an amine of the formula VII may be protected with an alkoxycarbonyl group or benzyloxycarbonyl group by reaction with the corresponding alkylchloroformate or benzylchloroformate in the presence of a base, such as a tertiary amine (for example pyridine or triethylamine), and in the presence of a solvent such as dichloromethane. A compound of the formula VIII may be protected on the sulphonamide nitrogen by a 2-methoxyethoxymethyl group or a trialkylsilylethoxymethyl group by reaction with 2-methoxyethoxymethyl chloride or trialkylsilylethoxymethyl chloride respectively, in the presence of a base such as diisopropylethylamine or sodium hydride, and in a suitable solvent such as DMF. Sulphonyl halides of Formula V are known in the art or may be obtained, for example, by analogy therewith, for example by analogy with the procedures described in European Patent applications, publication nos. 558288 and 569193. A convenient method for obtaining sulphonyl halides of Formula V is from the corresponding amine of Formula IX, as illustrated in the Examples hereinafter or by analogy therewith. Amines of the Formula IX are commercially available or are well known in the art, being described in standard works of heterocyclic chemistry, and others may be obtained by analogy therewith using standard procedures of organic chemistry.<br>
It will be appreciated that process (a) may be modified, for example, such that functional group interconversion and deprotection of a protecting group P may be carried put in one step, or stepwise with or with out isolation of the intermediate products, for example as illustrated in Examples 8, 26, 28, 29, 36, 39,40,42,43,44,47, 55 and 56. (b)      An amine of the Formula VII (or an alkali metal salt thereof) is reacted with a sulphonyl halide of the Formula XI in which Hal. is a halogeno group (for example chloro, bromo or iodo) or a sulphonate of the Formula XIa in which Re is an electron deficient phenyl group, for example 4-nitrophenyl, in a suitable solvent.<br>
When a compound of Formula XI is used, a convenient solvent includes, for example, pyridine. A catalyst, such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, may be added to assist the coupling reaction. The reaction is generally carried out at a temperature in the range of, for example, 0°C to 120°C and more generally 20°C to 120°C. Alternatively a solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan or DMF may be used in the presence of a suitable inorganic base, such as sodium or potassium carbonate (which may be present as an aqueous solution) or an organic base, for example a tertiary amine such as pyridine or triethylamine. When the alkali metal salt of the amine of Formula VII is used, this may be formed in situ, for example with the use of a suitable base such as lithium diisopropylamide at a temperature, for example, of about -60°C, or sodium hydride, for example, at ambient temperature, prior to the addition of the sulphonyl halide. It will be appreciated that the reaction of a sulphonyl halide with an amine to form a sulphonamide (and the type of solvents and conditions used therein) is well-known in the art.<br>
When a compound of the Formula XIa is used, it is preferred to prepare the alkali metal salt of the amine of Formula VII in situ, as mentioned above, using, for example, DMF as solvent, prior to addition of the compound of Formula XIa. The reaction may then conveniently be carried out at or near ambient temperature.<br>
A compound of Formula XIa may be, obtained using a similar procedure to that described above for the preparation of a compound of Formula III, but using a compound of Formula X in place of the compound of Formula IV. A compound of Formula X may be obtained by reaction of a sulphonyl halide of Formula V with the appropriate phenol of<br>
Formula Re.OH, such as 4-nitrophenol, using conventional procedures, for example, by heating in pyridine or by using DMF as solvent in the presence of a tertiary amine, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, at a temperature in the range of, for example, 20-100°C.<br>
Whereafter, a compound of the Formula I may be converted into another compound of Formula I by conventional functional group interconversion, for example as illustrated in Example 22, 33, 34, 37, 38,45, 46, 57, 59, 60, 65, 68 and 69.<br>
It will be appreciated that, in addition to the protecting group Preferred to above, it may be convenient or necessary to protect one or more functional groups with a suitable protecting group prior to carrying out the process of (a) or (b) above, or prior to carrying out a functional group interconversion, followed by removal of the protecting group (for example, as illustrated in Examples 19,48,49 and 52). Suitable protecting groups and procedures for their use, together with procedure for removing the protecting group, are well known in the art, for example as described in "Protective Groups in Organic Syntheses" by Theodora Greene (John Wiley and Sons Inc., 1981).<br>
Whereafter, when a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of a compound of formula I is required, it may be obtained, for example, by reaction with the appropriate base affording a physiologically-acceptable cation, or with the appropriate acid affording a physiologically-acceptable anion, or by any other conventional salt formation procedure.<br>
Additionally, a compound of the formula I may be converted into a prodrug (for example, a metabolically labile ester or amide) by methods well known in the art. For example, a pharmaceutically acceptable metabolically labile ester or amide may be formed respectively by esterifying a compound of the formula I bearing a carboxylic acid (or hydroxy) group or reacting the carboxylic acid group (or a reactive derivative thereof) with the appropriate amine, using conventional techniques.<br>
Further, when an optically active form of a compound of formula I is required, one of the aforesaid processes may be carried out using an optically active starting material. Alternatively, the racemic form of a compound of formula I may be resolved, for example<br>
by reaction with a optically active form of a suitable organic base, for example, ephedrine, N,N,N-trimethyl(l-phenylethyl)ammonium hydroxide or 1-phenylethylamine, followed by conventional separation of the diastereoisomeric mixture of salts thus obtained, for example by fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent, for example a (l-4C)alkanol, whereafter the optically active form of said compound of formula I may be liberated by treatment with acid using a conventional procedure, for example using an aqueous mineral acid such as dilute hydrochloric acid. Alternatively, a racemic compound may be separated into its individual isomers by chromatography using a chiral support, for example as illustrated in Example 67.<br>
Certain of the intermediates defined or exemplified herein are novel, for example compounds of the formula III and IV, and are provided as a further feature of the invention.<br>
As stated above, the compounds of formula I will have beneficial pharmacological effects in warm-blooded animals (including man) in diseases and medical conditions where elevated or abnormal levels of endothelin play a significant causative role. (References to studies supporting the implication of endothelin in various diseases or medical conditions are, for example, disclosed in International Patent Applications, Publication Nos. WO 93/21219 and WO 94/02474.) The compounds of the invention will thus be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions such as hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, dyslipidaemia, atherosclerosis, restenosis, acute and chronic renal failure, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, intermittent claudication, critical limb ischaemia, asthma, and organ failure after general surgery or translantation. They may also be useful for the treatment of pre-eclampsia, premature labour, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, dysrrhythmia, cardiogenic and endotoxin shock, diabetes mellitus, Raynaud's disease, scleroderma, Buerger's disease, systemic sclerosis, bronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, liver cirrhosis, osteoporosis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, urinary incontinence, migraine, glaucoma, arthritis and certain cancers.<br>
The endothelin receptor antagonist activity of the compounds of the invention may be assessed using one or more of the following procedure^. Test A:   The endothelin receptor antagonist activity of compounds of formula I may be assessed in vitro by their ability to inhibit binding of [125I]-Endothelin-l to its receptors.<br><br>
Human ETA or ETB receptors (sub-types of the endothelin receptor) were expressed in Mouse Erythroleukemic Cells (MEL cells) by using standard molecular techniques (for example, as described by Sambrook J., Fritsch E.F. &amp; Maniatis T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Press, USA). cDNA sequences encoding the human ETA and ETB receptor (Hosoda K. et al (1991), FEES Lett., 287. 23-26 and Sakamoto A. et al, (1991), Biochem. Biophys Res. Comm., 178. 656-663) are subcloned into pBluescript vector followed by insertion into the MEL cell expression vector pEV as described by Needham et al (1992), Nuc. Acids Res., 20, 997-1003. The resultant expression vector was transfected into MEL cells by electroporation using procedures described by Shelton et al., (1993), Receptors and Channels, 1, 25-37. MEL cells expressing the recombinant human ETA or ETB receptor were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 10% Fetal Calf Serum (PCS), 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mg/ml Gibco Geneticin (G-418) sulphate. After 3-6 days induction with 1% N,N-dimethylsuphoxide, the MEL cells were harvested for membrane preparation. Freshly prepared MEL cell pellets (3xl09 cells) were homogenised in 30 ml of buffer containing 50mM 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-l,3-propanediol hydrochloride (Tris HC1), 0.19M sucrose, 5 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 100 µg/ml bacitracin, 1mM benzamidine and ImM phenanthroline pH 7.4 at 5°C. Unbroken cells and nuclei were sedimented by centrifuging the homogenate at 1500 x g for 15 minutes at 5°C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen until use.<br>
[125I]-Endothelin-1 binding to MEL cell membranes was measured in incubation buffer containing 50mM Tris HC1, ImM CaCl2, 0.05% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate, 0.1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 0.02% sodium azide pH 7.4 at 30°C after 180 minutes incubation. Membrane suspension (equivalent to 1.5µg and 0.5µg protein/tube ETA and ETB receptor respectively) was added to the incubation containing test compound and 30pM[125I]-Endothelin-l in a total volume of 225µl. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of lOOnM unlabelled Endothelin-1. The incubation was terminated by harvesting the incubation with 50mM Tris pH 7.4 through a GF/B filter on a Brandel cell harvester. The filter discs were punched out and counted in a gamma counter. Compounds are tested in triplicate over a range of concentrations and IC50 (or pIC50) values calculated.<br>
In general, compounds of formula I as defined above show inhibition in Test A with a pIC50 of 6 or more.<br><br>
Test B:  The endothelin receptor antagonist activity of compounds of formula I may be assessed in vitro in isolated tissues by their ability to inhibit the relaxant response to endothelin-1 in the guinea-pig isolated taenia coli. Guinea pigs of either sex and weight &gt;250 g are killed by cervical dislocation and the caecum removed and placed in cold oxygenated Krebs solution. Strips of taenia coli are dissected out and approximately 4 cm lengths set up for isotonic recording in a 20 ml organ bath containing oxygenated Krebs solution at 32°C. After a 90-120 minute equilibration period to allow the tissue to spontaneously develop an increased tone, a cumulative concentration-response curve (relaxation) is constructed to endothelin-1 (0.3-10nM). The tissue is then washed for a period of at least 90 minutes before construction of a second concentration-response curve to endothelin-1 in the presence of the test compound. The test compound is added to the organ bath (at an initial concentration of 20µM) at least 30 minutes before constructing the second concentration-response curve to endothelin-1. The endothelin-1 concentration ratio for each experiment is determined by comparing the most parallel portions of the control and drug treated concentration-response curves. From this a pA2 is calculated: pA2 = -log[molar drug concentration] + log[concentration ratio -1].<br>
Test C:   This in vivo test involves the measurement of the antagonist effect of the test compound against the pressor response induced by intravenously-administered proendothelin-1 in a pithed rat preparation.<br>
Male rats (280-3 30g) are anaesthetised with halothane and artifically respired through a tracheal cannula. Rats are pithed by passing a 2mm diameter needle through the orbit, through the foramen magnum, and down into the spinal canal. The left femoral vein and the right carotid artery are isolated and catheters filled with heparinised saline are implanted for administration of compounds and measurement of blood pressure respectively. Body temperature is maintained at 38°C (as measured rectally) by a heated pad. Rats with anjnitial baseline mean arterial pressure of less than 55 mmHg or greater than 70 mmHg are excluded. Blood pressure is allowed to stabilize for approximately 10 minutes before a baseline reading is taken. Two initial challenges of proendothelin-1 (0.3 and 1.0 nmol kg"1) are administered intravenously in a cumulative fashion and pressor responses recorded. Thereafter, a 55 minute recovery period is allowed and rats in which the blood pressure fails<br><br>
to return to within 20% of the baseline are excluded. Test compound is dosed intravenously at a dose volume of 1.0 ml kg"1 body weight and further challenges of proendothelin-1 are administered 5 minutes later. Proendothelin-1 is administered cumulatively in increasing doses (starting at 0.3 nmolkg"1) until pressor responses are observed. Endothelin receptor antagonism is quantified by calculating dose ratio shifts at the 30mmHg change level.<br>
Test D:   This in vivo test involves the measurement of the antagonist effect of the test compound against the pressor response induced by intravenously-administered proendothelin-1 in a conscious rat preparation.<br>
Male rats (260-290 g) are anaesthetised with Saffan administered via the tail vein. The right jugular vein and carotid artery are isolated and catheters filled with heparin implanted. These are exteriorised at the back of the neck using a metal trochar and the neck incision closed with autoclips. Rats are housed-individually with free access to food and water during the recovery phase. Later in the day, food is removed and the rats are fasted overnight with free access to water. The following day the rats are placed in perspex restraining tubes and the arterial catheter drained and connected to a pressure transducer for measurement of mean arterial pressure. Following a ten minute stabilization period, proendothelin-1 (usually 0.3-1.0 nmol kg"1) is administered cumulatively until a pressor response of 30 mmHg is achieved. The animals are then returned to their cages and allowed to recover for 2 hours. The test compound is administered orally (by gavage) at a known time point during the recovery period. The dose response curve to proendothelin-1 is then repeated at a fixed time after the oral dose (usually 0.5 or 1.0 hours) and again at a further time point (3 or 5 hours). Endothelin receptor antagonism is quantified by calculating dose ratio shifts at the 30mmHg change level.<br>
By way of illustration of the endothelin antagonist properties of compounds of the formula I, the compound of Example 3 showed a pIC50 value of 8.6 in Test A and, when dosed orally to rats at 3mg/kg, using the protocol of Test D, produced a mean dose ratio shift = 2.93(n=5) on the pressor response to proendothelin-1, as determined one hour after administration of the test compound.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I will generally be administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes to warm-blooded animals (including man) requiring such treatment in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, as is well known in the pharmaceutical art. According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as defined above, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such compositions will conveniently be in a form suitable for oral administration (e.g. as a tablet, capsule, solution, suspension or emulsion) or parenteral administration (e.g. as an injectable aqueous or oily solution, or injectable emulsion).<br>
The compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may also be advantageously administered for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes together with another pharmacological agent known in the general art to be of value in treating one or more of the diseases or medical conditions referred to hereinabove, such as beta-adrenergic blocker (for example atenolol), a calcium channel blocker (for example nifedipine), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example lisinopril), a diuretic (for example furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide), an endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitor (for example phosphoramidon), a neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, a nitric oxide donor, an anti-oxidant, a vasodilator, a dopamine agonist, a neuroprotective agent, a steroid, a beta-agonist, an anti-coagulant, or a thrombolytic agent. It is to be understood that such combination therapy constitutes a further aspect of the invention.<br>
In general a compound of formula I (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as appropriate) will be administered to man so that, for example, a daily oral dose of up to 50 mg/kg body weight (and preferably of up to 10 mg/kg) or a daily parenteral dose of up to 5 mg/kg body weight (and preferably of up to 1 mg/kg) is received, given in divided doses as necessary, the precise amount of compound (or salt) administered and the route and form of administration depending on size, age and sex of the person being treated and on the particular disease or medical condition being treated according to principles well known in the medical arts.<br>
In addition to their aforesaid use in therapeutic medicine in humans, the compounds of formula I are also useful in the veterinary treatment of similar conditions<br><br>
affecting commercially valuable warm-blooded animals, such as dogs, cats, horses and cattle. In general for such treatment, the compounds of the formula I will be administered in an analogous amount and manner to those described above for administration to humans. The compounds of formula I are also of value as pharmacological tools in the development and standardisation of test systems for the evaluation of the effects of endothelin in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the continuing search for new and improved therapeutic agents.<br>

Example 1<br>
1M sodium hydroxide solution (11.2 ml) was added to a solution of N-(isobutoxycarbonyl)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-N-(3-methoxy-5-methylpyrazin-2-yl)pyridine-3-sulphonamide (2.6 g) in methanol (50 ml) and the mixture was stirred and heated under reflux for 30 minutes. Water (100 ml) was added and the mixture was acidified to pH 3 with 2M hydrochloric acid. This mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (5 x 30 ml) and the extracts were washed with water (30 ml) and saturated sodium chloride solution and dried (MgSO4). Volatile material was removed by evaporation and the residue was purified by gradient elution with 0-15% ethyl acetate/hexane through a silica gel Mega Bond Elut column followed by trituration with ether to give 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-N-(3-methoxy-5-methylpyrazin-2-yl)pyridine-3-sulphonamide (720 mg) as a solid, m.p. 128-129°C; 'H NMR (CDC13): 0.95 (d, 6H), 1.9 (m, IH), 2.3 (s, 3H), 2.55 (d, 2H), 3.8 (s, 3H), 6.6 (s, IH), 7.1-7.3 (m, 4H), 7.35 (s, IH), 7.5 (dd, IH), 8.7 (dd, IH), 8.8 (dd, IH); mass spectrum (positive electrospray (+ve ESP)): 413 (M+H)+.<br>

(i)       A solution of sodium nitrite (6.5g) in water (15 ml) was added gradually to a solution of 3-amino-2-chloropyridine (10 g) in acetic acid (100 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (37 ml) at 0-5 °C. This cold solution was then added portion-wise to a stirred and cooled (5°C) mixture of copper(I) chloride (2.33 g) in acetic acid (160 ml) saturated with sulphur dioxide keeping the temperature below 10°C. After the addition was complete the cooling bath was removed and the mixture was stirred a further 90 minutes at ambient temperature. Volatile material was removed by evaporation and water (300 ml) was added to the residue to give a solid. The water was decanted off and the solid was dissolved in ether (500 ml) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (200 ml), water (200 ml) and saturated sodium chloride solution and was then dried (MgSO4). Volatile material was removed by evaporation to give 2-chloropyridine-3-sulphonyl chloride (12.1 g) as an oil which solidified upon refrigeration and was used without further purification; 'H NMR (CDC13): 7.5 (dd, IH), 8.5 (dd, IH), 8.7 (dd, IH).<br>
 (ii)     Sodium hydride (60% dispersion in oil; 0.083 g) was added to a stirred solution of isobutyl N-(3-methoxy-5-methylpyrazin-2-yl)-carbamate (0.451 g) in dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 8 ml) at 4°C. The mixture was stirred whilst warming to ambient temperature over 1 hour, was recooled to 4°C and 2-chloropyridine-3-sulphonyl chloride (0.40 g) was added in portions over 2 minutes. The mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred a further 30 minutes. Water (40 ml) was added, followed by 1M hydrochloric acid to acidify. This mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (4x15 ml) and the organic extracts were washed with water (10 ml) and saturated sodium chloride solution (10 ml) and then dried (MgSO4). Volatile material was removed by evaporation and the residue was purified by gradient elution with 0-35% ethyl acetate/hexane through a silica gel Mega Bond Elut column and triturated with ether to give 2-chloro-N-isobutoxycarbonyl-N-(3-methoxy-5-methylpyrazin-2-yl)-pyridine-3-sulphonamide (0.34 g) as a solid, m.p. 99-101°C; 'H NMR (CDC13): 0.7 (d, 6H), 1.7 (m, 1H), 2.5 (s, 3H), 3.8 (d, 2H), 4.0 (s, 3H), 7.45 (dd, 1H), 7.9 (s, 1H), 8.6 (dd, 1H), 8.7 (dd, 1H); mass spectrum (+ve ESP): 415 (M+H)+.<br>
