DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference now to the drawings and more particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a first configuration of a networked sound system according to the invention. Sound reproduction device 10 includes an AM/FM tuner 12, audio signal processing circuitryl4, control electronics circuitryl6 for controlling the tuner and signal processing circuitry, a remote control device 17 for communicating commands to control electronics circuitry 16, and an electroacoustical transducer 18. An auxiliary (hereinafter "vaux") input 13 typically implemented as a signal jack permits the sound reproduction device to<br><br>
receive audio signals from outside sources, such as portable CD players. Computer system (PC) 20 includes a bus 22 which interconnects various computer system components and carries data and control signals between them. Hardware components !i may include CPU 24, RAM 26, CD player 28, a mass storage device, such as a hard disk 30, a network interface card 32, and a sound card 33. Computer system 20 also includes a number of external connectors for connecting bus 22 with various external devices.   A first external connector 34<br>
ip connects to an external display 36. A second external connector 3 8 connects to an external input device such as a mouse 40. A third external connector 42 connects to a keyboard 44. A fourth external connector 46 connects network interface  card 32  to a  local or wide area network for<br>
15 transmitting to and receiving signals from remote devices that are connected to the local or wide area network. A fifth external connector 43 connects to external mass storage device 45. Stereo jack 48 connects sound card 33 to radio audio signal processing circuitryl4 through analog input terminal<br>
20 49. Audio system control connector 50 connects bus 22 to control electronics circuitry 16 through digital input terminal 51.<br>
Referring now to FIG.  2,  there  is  shown a  second configuration of a networked audio system according to the<br>
25 invention. The elements of FIG. 2 are the same as the elements of FIG. 1, with some exceptions. Sound card 33 of FIG. I is not needed in this configuration.  Stereo jack 48<br><br><br>
and the audio system control connector 50 of FIG. 1 are replaced by a bus interface connector 52, which connects to an interface unit 54. The interface unit 54 connects to audio signal processing circuitry 14 through analog terminal 49 and<br>
  to control electronics circuitry 16 through digital terminal 51. Interface unit 54 will be described in more detail in connection with a subsequent figure.<br>
A networked audio system which contains both the powered speaker  and  the  radio  tuner  in  a  single  enclosure  is<br>
  advantageous over conventional audio systems which house the speakers and radio tuner in separate enclosures, because the system can then be configured to occupy less space in a work area.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, there is shown interface unit 54 in<br>
  more detail. Signal line 56 from interface connector 52 is connected to logic circuitry 58. Logic circuitry 58 is coupled to D/A converter 60 which is connected to analog terminal 49 by analog signal line 62. Analog terminal 49 is in turn connected to audio signal processing circuitry 14.<br>
   Logic circuitry 58 is connected to digital terminal 51 by digital signal line 64. Digital terminal 51 is in turn connected to control electronics circuitry 16. If bi¬directional flow of analog signals is desired, a second analog signal path is provided.   The second analog signal path<br>
   includes a signal line between audio signal processing circuitry 14 and a second analog terminal 66; a second analog signal line 68 connecting second analog terminal 66 and an A/D<br>
^ |0<br><br><br>
converter 70; and a signal line connecting A/D converter 70 and logic circuitry 58.<br>
In  operation,   logic  circuitry  58  determines  if transmissions on signal line 56 from bus 22 are intended for<br>
   sound reproduction device 10. If signals on bus 22 are intended for sound reproduction device 10, logic circuitry 58 determines whether the signals are control signals or audio information. If the signals are control signals, logic circuitry 58 transmits signals to digital terminal 51 over<br>
   digital signal line 64.   If signals are audio information,  logic circuitry transmits signals to D/A converter 60 which converts the digital signal to an analog audio signal.  Analog audio signal is then transmitted over analog signal line 62 to analog  terminal  49  and  then to  audio  signal  processing<br>
   circuitry 14. The digital signal path including control circuitry 16, digital terminal 51, digital signal line 64, logic circuitry 58 signal line 56, and interface connector 52 is constructed and arranged to transmit signals bidirectionally,  so  that  control  signals  originating  at<br>
 	control circuitry 16 can be transmitted to computer bus 22 for<br>
processing by CPU 24. If bidirectional flow of analog circuitry is desired, analog signals may be transmitted from audio signal processing circuitry 14 to second analog terminal 66,     and to A/D converter 70, where it is converted to a<br>
         digital signal that is then transmitted to logic circuitry 58. In one implementation, sound reproduction device 10 is a Wave® radio equipped with an appropriate communications ports,<br><br>
Docks^feTU2T03-390001<br>
available from the Bose Corporation of Framingham, Massachusetts. Computer system 20 may be a conventional multimedia personal computer.<br>
There are typically three implementation arrangements for<br>
a interface unit 54. One alternative is to implement interface unit 54 as a module in computer system 10. In this arrangement, interface unit 54 is implemented as a circuit board that connects internally to bus 22 (so that interface connector 52 is internal to the computer, and is physically<br>
Ki connected to an expansion slot in the computer), signal lines 62, 64, and 6 8 are implemented as cables, and digital terminal 51, analog terminal 49 (and second analog terminal 66, if present) are external ports for the sound reproduction device 10.<br>
15 A second alternative is to implement interface unit 54 as an intermediate, separate unit, typically integrated with cables which implement signal lines 62, 64, 68, and 56. In this arrangement, interface connector 52 is an external computer port, and digital terminal 51, analog terminal 49<br>
::o (and second analog terminal 66, if present) are external ports for the sound reproduction device 10.<br>
A third alternative is to implement interface unit 54 as a module, such as a circuit board, in the sound reproduction device 10.  In this arrangement, sound reproduction device 10<br>
   has an external port to accommodate a cable that implements signal line 56, and the remaining signal lines and terminals are internal to sound reproduction device 10.<br><br>
A networked sound system according to the invention may have a number of operating modes. In a first mode, sound reproduction device 10 operates as a standalone sound reproduction device (hereinafter ""standalone mode'1), similar to a conventional radio or hi-fi receiver. Operating in this mode, sound reproduction device operates independently of computer system 20, and even operates if computer system 2 0 is not running. In a second operating mode (hereinafter """sound effects mode'1), sound reproduction device 10 operates as conventional computer speakers, reproducing sounds that are incidental to programs running on computer system 20. Examples may be sound effects in computer games, audible alarms and warnings, indicating, for example, that the computer system has received electronic mail. In a third operating mode (hereinafter """audio system mode") sound reproduction device 10 operates as a processor and reproducer of audio signals from a variety of sources, including networked sources and components of the computer system 20.<br>
When the system is operating in the sound effects mode and the audio systems mode, the operation of the components of the system is controlled by a software program running on computer system 20. For efficient use of computer resources, the software program may be divided into two program modules, one of which provides communications between components of computer system 2 0 and sound reproduction device 10, and a second which accesses sound sources as described below. Additionally,   the   first   program  module   can  contain<br><br><br>
instructions such that it automatically activates the second program module if it detects a communication from sound reproduction device 10 to computer system 20 that requires that the second module be running.<br>
I<br>
 Operating in standalone mode, sound reproduction device 10 is controlled as, and operates as a standard radio or receiver. On/off, tuning, and volume control are all either entered by control buttons or dials that are connected electronically to control electronics circuitry 16, or by 1]   remote control device 17.<br>
Operating  in  sound  effects  mode,  sound  reproduction device  10  is  controlled  as,  and  operates  as,  standard amplified computer speakers having an on/off switch and volume control. ■5        Operating  in  audio  systems  mode,  sound  reproduction .device 10 reproduces sound from tuner 12,  aux input 13, digital audio signals stored in RAM 26, hard disk 30, or external mass storage device 45; audio signals received from sources connected to the local or wide area network connected ::0   to network interface 32; and other sources such as CD player 2 8 (which can be a component of computer system 2 0 as shown, or which can be a separate component, connected directly to sound reproduction device 10) .  The source or sources of the audio signals is controlled by a computer program irunning on 25   computer system 20.<br>
If sound reproduction device 10 is in the "off" state, and is turned "on" either by pressing the "on" or "power"<br>
^r-\Lj<br><br><br><br>
button or a button or indicator performing an equivalent function, or by pressing the corresponding button on remote control device 17, control electronics circuitry 16 detects whether computer 2 0 is connected, and if connected, in the 5 ""on' or ""off' state. If computer 20 is not connected or is in the ""off'1 state, sound reproduction device 10 operates in standalone mode, and sound reproduction device begins reproducing audio signals from the last internal audio signal source (in one implementation, either AM or FM signals from<br>
   AM/FM tuner 12, or signals from aux input 13) . If computer 2 0 is in the ""on1' position and the second program module (as described above in the discussion of ""Operating Modes'1) is not running, the first program module activates the second program module,  and the  sound reproduction device begins<br>
     producing  signals  from the  last  audio signal  source,  as described above in the discussion of ""audio systems mode.' If computer 20 is in the ""on' position and the second program module  is  running,  the  sound  reproduction device  begins producing signals from the last audio signal source.<br>
::0 Recorded on hard disk 3 0 or external mass storage 4 5 may be information about typically either AM broadcast, FM broadcast, broadcast radio stations available to the reproduction device 10 through tuner 12. Typically, availability is determined by a combination of proximity to<br>
::5 and direction to the broadcast site, directionality and power of the broadcast signal, obstructions (such as tall buildings and mountains),  and competing signals,  especially those in<br><br>
nearby frequency bands. The list of radio stations available to the reproduction device may be assembled in a number of ways. In a simple form, the user may manually tune a radio station and manually enter into the data base identifying information about the radio station. In more sophisticated forms, the reproduction device may automatically scan the broadcast frequency spectrum and assemble a list of available radio stations by noting the frequency and by measuring signal strength of received signals, or a suggested list of radio stations, based on location information such as zip code, or can be compiled by a resource (such as the vendor of the reproduction device or a commercial information assembler). Information about each radio station can also be collected and stored.   Such information can include:  station broadcast<br>
     frequency;  station call  letters and/or other identifiers; station format (news, type of music, location, and others).<br>
Information about radio stations that are accessible over the local or wide area network (hereinafter web radio stations) is also acquired and stored.  This information may<br>
   be acquired through search engines, by commercially available listings from suppliers such as vTuner (vTuner.com), or assembled by the user. Information about web radio stations typically include a station identifier, a network address, a category (e.g. news, rock, jazz,  sports, classical), and a<br>
     location of origination.<br><br>
Docke^L©rrCfTT03-390001<br>
The information about broadcast radio stations and web radio stations, respectively, may be organized and sorted based on any of the information types mentioned above.<br>
In addition to  reproducing sound,  a networked sound<br>
;i system according to the invention can record, on hard disk 3 0 or external mass storage device 45. Recording can be done simultaneously with sound reproduction, or in the ""background. " Sound is recorded in units, and the units are identified and information about the units are recorded in a<br>
13   data base.  For example, a typical recording unit is a track on a CD.  The information about each unit (track) may include title,  composer,  artist,  category  (e.g.  classical,  rock, blues).  The information may be obtained automatically or by user intervention from commercially available internet sources<br>
15 and/or may be entered or edited by the user. Additionally, for other types of recording units, the information may be of other types (such as for radio broadcasts a station and a time interval; for athletic events the date and participating teams; for cultural events the date, performer, composer; and<br>
2) others). For convenience, recorded units and assemblages of recorded units are referred to as ""music files' even though the recorded units are not necessarily recordings of music.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, there is shown a diagram that will be used to discuss the logical relationships of recorded<br>
25 units and assemblages of recorded units. Recorded units 110-1 through 110-n each contain data representing the recorded sound and information about the recorded sound.  Information<br><br><br>
could include the artist, the composer, and the type of music. A first type of assemblage of recorded units is an ""album11 represented here as items 112a, 112b, 112c. Albums 112a, 112b, and 112c may also have associated with them information<br>
! similar to the information about the recorded units, such as artist, composer, and type of music. Albums may include recorded units that have different composers, artists, or type<br>
I   of music.<br>
A second type of assemblage includes recorded units with<br>
10 common identifying characteristics, sometimes referred to as common ""metadata1' values. ""Metadata" values are typically included in file header information of music files in many popular music file formats. Metadata values may include the artist, the composer, the type of music, and others.   For<br>
-5 example, element 114 represents an assemblage that includes all albums (112a and 112b) that include a track performed by a predetermined artist and all tracks performed by that artist. Album 112b is included in the assemblage, even though it may include only one track 110-7 performed by that artist and even<br>
20 though that album may contain tracks that are performed by other artists. In other embodiments, the assemblage may be set up such that only tracks performed by the artist are included in the assemblage. Similarly, assemblage 114 may represent an assemblage of all recorded units written by a<br>
:!5   common composer or containing a common type of music.<br>
For example, if an assemblage contains music files having a common composer metadata value of ""Beethoven11, each time<br>
-J*\%<br><br><br>
the assemblage is requested, a computer database program may search all the music files for the metadata value of ^Beethoven' as the composer. In this manner, each time a new music file is recorded with """Beethoven' as the composer, it 5 is automatically added to the assemblage. In other words, this second type of assemblage may be said to be dynamically constructed.<br>
A third type of assemblage is represented by playlist 116.  In this example, playlist 116 includes artist assemblage<br>
-0   114, album 112c, and track 110-n.<br>
Information about recorded units, playlists and other assemblages, broadcast radio stations, computer network accessible radio stations is stored in a data base stored in RAM 2 6 mass storage device 3 0 or external mass storage device<br>
15   45.   In one implementation, a record of the data base may correspond to a broadcast radio station, a web radio station, or a recorded unit.  The fields of the records representing broadcast radio stations may contain information such as call letters,  broadcast  frequency,  station  format,  or  signal<br>
!0 strength. The fields of record representing computer network accessible radio stations may include a identifiers, network addresses, locations, and station formats. The fields of record representing recorded units may include the metadata values as described above.<br>
!5 Referring to FIG. 5, there is shown a control panel from sound reproduction device 10. Preset buttons 72a - 72f each have a broadcast frequency associated with it.   When that<br><br><br>
button is depressed by the user, the control electronics circuitry causes the control electronics circuitry (of FIG. 1) to cause the tuner 12 to tune to the frequency associated with that preset button, j In addition to associating broadcast frequencies to the identifiers, a networked sound system according to the invention can assign other entities to the preset button. Other  entities  can  include web  radio  network  addresses,<br>
I    playlists; or recorded units, such as individual CD tracks, or 0   other assemblages of recorded unit as described above.<br>
In a networked sound system according to the invention, there are at least three ways of activating the preset buttons. The buttons of FIG. 5 can be depressed; corresponding buttons on remote control device 17 can be 5 depressed; or a graphical representation of a corresponding preset button that is caused to appear on external display 36 by a computer program may be selected by operation of mouse 40. Hereinafter, the term ""preset indicator'1 will be used to denote the preset buttons on the control panel (FIG. 5) , the<br>
;o   preset buttons on the remote control device (FIG. 8) , or the<br>
graphical representation of the preset buttons on the display<br>
(FIG.  6).    In  one  embodiment,  there  is  a  one  to  one<br>
correspondence between the preset buttons on the control panel<br>
of the sound reproduction device, the preset buttons on remote<br>
;5 control device 17, and the graphical representation of preset buttons appearing on external display 36. Activating a preset button on control panel of FIG. 5, the corresponding preset<br><br><br>
button on remote control device 17, or the graphical representation of the preset button on external display 36 causes the same entity to be selected. For each different source, -a different entity may be assigned to each preset button, as will be described below. There may also be multiple sets of values to a single set of presets being used with a single source as discussed above. For example, there may be multiple sets of FM and/or AM radio stations.<br>
A common user interface screen is caused to appear on external display, with some of the portions of the screen having different identifying legends. Referring to FIG. 6, there is shown a user interface screen. Source selection region 78 has graphical regions enabling the user to select the audio signal source. In this implementation, a CD, AM broadcast radio, FM broadcast radio, Web Radio, and Music Files (e.g. recorded units) can be selected. In current selection region 88, information about the selection currently displayed is shown. In available selections region 90, information about the available selections is shown. In preset section 92, six graphical figures, corresponding to the six preset buttons shown in FIG. 6 are displayed. "Tune" graphical figures 79 are discussed below in the discussion of FIG. 8.<br>
The information displayed in the available selections region 90 may be ordered based on any of the metadata values. For example, the list of FM stations of FIG. 6 can be ordered in by station ID as shown, or could be ordered by broadcast<br><br>
Docket No 021053-39000<br><br>
frequency, or by category (station format). Ordering the list of stations in different manners enables the user to more easily select the music to be reproduced from the list of available selections, especially if the number of available selections is large. For example, if the user has selected ""web radio'1 as the source, there may be hundreds of entries displayed in the available selections region. If the user wants to listen to a particular type of music, for example jazz,  the user can order the list of available web radio<br>
    stations by station format, and scroll through the list and listen to web radio stations until a suitable station is found. Scrolling through the list can be done by using the arrow keys on the computer keyboard, the ""tuning1' buttons 128 (FIG. 5) on the control panel, or the corresponding buttons 147 (FIG. 8) on the remote control device.<br>
The entities that can be assigned to the preset buttons are dependent on the audio source selected by activating the appropriate graphical figure in the source selection region 78.  If the CD source has been activated, the preset buttons<br>
 )   are not active.  If the AM broadcast or FM broadcast graphical figure have been activated, broadcast frequencies in the AM and FM broadcast bands, respectively, can be assigned to the preset buttons.  For convenience and ease of identification, the call letters may also be displayed on the graphical<br>
   representation. If the web radio audio source has been activated, a URL of a web radio website are assigned to the preset buttons.   For ease of identification, the name, or<br><br>
other identification about the website is typically displayed on the preset buttons.<br>
If the music files audio source has been selected, any assemblage,  as discussed above,  of recorded units can be<br>
   assigned to a preset buttons. For combinations of recorded units, a play mode may also be assigned to the preset button. "Play modes'1 may include sequential, in which the recorded units are played in the order they appear in the database (typically, for example, for an album, this means in the order<br>
0   the individual ""cuts' appear on the album), ""shuffle' or<br>
""random, " in which the recorded units are played in a random<br>
order, and ""repeat' either single cuts or a sequence of cuts.<br>
In one embodiment, initial preset assignment of broadcast<br>
radio stations is done automatically.  Referring to FIG. 7,<br>
15 there is shown a flow diagram of a process for automatically initial preset assignment by a computer program running on computer system 20. In step 100, a locator is entered, for example, by a user entering a ""zip code' using keyboard 44. In optional step 102, the user enters radio format preference<br>
10	or preferences (i.e. such as news, talk, type of music as<br>
discussed above). At step 104, the computer program directs AM/FM tuner 12 to scan the applicable broadcast frequency band for strong signals. At step 106, the strongest signals are compared to available  stations based on the  locator and<br>
15	information about available radio stations, as discussed above<br>
in the discussion of audio system mode operation. At step 108, the broadcast frequencies of the strongest signals are<br>
23<br><br>
Docket No 021053-39000<br><br>
108, the broadcast frequencies of the strongest signals are<br>
assigned by the computer program to the presets.  If format<br>
preferences  have been entered at optional  step  102,  the<br>
strongest signals for each of the selected formats may be<br>
     assigned to the presets.   The number of presets for each<br>
format is dependent on the number of presets available and the<br>
    number of formats selected.   For example, if the user has<br>
     selected two formats and there are six presets available, the<br>
     broadcast frequencies of the strongest three signals in each<br>
    format are assigned to presets.  If optional step 102 has not<br>
been performed, stations may be assigned to presets in other<br>
ways; for example, the strongest signal of each of the formats<br>
may be  assigned to a preset,  or the  strongest  signals,<br>
irrespective of format may be assigned to preset.<br>
        A user can enter control signals or data for controlling<br>
the operation of the sound system through three data/control<br>
input systems.   A first input system includes the input<br>
devices of computer system 20, including mouse 40, keyboard<br>
44, and external display 36.  A second input system includes<br>
    the buttons of control panel (FIG. 5) of sound reproduction<br>
device 10 of FIG. 1.  A third input system includes the remote<br>
control device 17 of FIG. 1, shown in more detail in FIG. 8.<br>
In one implementation, different subsets of control signals<br>
and data input can be entered through each of the input<br>
     systems.   In this implementation the control panel (FIG. 5)<br>
has input buttons for the following control/data functions:<br>
four buttons 12 0 for entering control signals and data for<br><br>
various clock-radio functions of sound reproduction device 10; a sound reproduction device on/off switch 122; a broadcast band selector button 124; an aux input selector 126; volume control buttons 127; two tuning buttons 128; and preset buttons 72a - 72f, discussed above. Remote control device (FIG.8) has input buttons for the following control/data functions: sound reproduction device on/off switch 13 0; volume control buttons 134; broadcast band selector button 136; PC signal source selector buttons 138, preset selector buttons 140a - 140f, CD player pause button 141; and five ""overloaded' or multi-use buttons. Button 142 activates the """snooze1' feature if the sound reproduction device has been turned on to a broadcast radio station by the alarm, or mutes or unmutes the sound reproduction device if the sound reproduction device has been turned on any other way. Button 144 turn off the alarm if the clock radio alarm feature of the sound reproduction device is sounding, or stops the CD player 28.  Track/tune button 147 is discussed in more detail below.<br>
Equivalent control signals that can be entered from more than one of the three input systems have the same effect, regardless of which input system was used to enter the data or control signal. For example, if the sound source is FM broadcast radio, and preset button 1 is activated, the audio system tunes to the broadcast frequency represented by preset button 1, regardless of whether the preset button was activated by pressing preset button 72a on the control panel, pressing preset button 140a, on remote control device 17, or<br><br>
Docket No 021053-39000<br><br>
by selecting preset icon 150a on the user interface screen<br>
(FIG. 6) shown on display 36 (FIG. 1) .  Additionally, if the<br>
data or control signal is entered through remote control<br>
device 17 or through the sound reproduction device control<br>
     panel (FIG. 5) , a visible indication is displayed on the user<br>
interface screen (FIG. 6).  For example, if preset button 140a<br>
(preset button 1) is pressed on remote control device 17, a<br>
visible indication appears on user interface screen (FIG. 6)<br>
shown on display 36.<br>
  The effect of the control signal may depend on the source of the audio signals. For example, if the source of the audio signals is the AM/FM tuner 12 (FIGS. 1 and 2), selecting the ""tuning" buttons 128 (FIG. 5) on the control panel, or the corresponding buttons 147  (FIG.  8)  on the remote control<br>
    device, or the corresponding graphical figures 79  (FIG. 6) causes the tuning frequency of the AM/FM tuner to change.  If the source is music files, the names of the music files may appear in the available selections region 90 (FIG. 6) of the interface screen, and selecting of the tuning buttons on the<br>
    control panel or the equivalent control buttons on remote control device or the equivalent graphical figure on the display screen may cause the display to change the highlighted music file. If the source is web radio stations, the available web  radio stations my appear in the available<br>
   selections region 90 (FIG. 6) of the interface screen, and selecting of the tuning buttons on the control panel or the equivalent control buttons on remote control device or the<br><br>
Docket No 021053-39000<br><br>
equivalent graphical figure on the display screen may cause the display to change the highlighted web radio station.<br>
In the event that the control electronics circuitry 16 (FIG. 1) of the sound reproduction device receives from remote 5 control device 17 a remote control signal that control electronics circuitry 16 cannot decode, the control electronics circuitry retransmits the remote control signal to computer system 2 0 for decoding.<br>
For  ease  of  selecting  individual  sources,  in  one<br>
n embodiment, in addition to specifying a category (such as music files, broadcast radio stations, computer network accessible radio stations, music files, and CD) of sources, the user may select from a subset of all the sources in a category.  For example, if the user has selected broadcast FM,<br>
15 broadcast AM, or network accessible radio as the source category, the user may choose to select an individual radio station from a subset of all available radio stations, the subset including only radio stations having a particular format, such as news; or if the user has selected music files<br>
    as the source category the user may choose to select a file from a subset of all available files, the subset including only music of a certain type, such as jazz.<br>
This  may  be  conveniently  done  using  the  available selections region 90 (FIG. 6) and the various control input<br>
   devices, including keyboard 44 or mouse 4 0 (FIGS. 1 and 2) radio control panel (FIG. 5), or the remote control device 17 (FIGS. 1, 2, and 8).  The computer program running on computer<br>
27<br><br>
2 0 may provide for the user to enter a preferred subset category, or alternatively, may allow the user to sort, order or filter the entries in the available selections region. The input devices may then be used to highlight and select entries in the available selections region 90. In one embodiment, the tuning keys 128 of the control panel (FIG. 5) , or the corresponding buttons 147 on remote control 17 are used to highlight and select entries in the available selections region.   In this embodiment, pressing the tuning key 128 or<br>
0 147 highlights the next entry in the available selections region 90. The tuning keys may also be used in the above manner even if the interface screen (FIG. 6) is not visible on the display, as may happen if the interface screen has been minimized or if the view of the interface screen is obscured<br>
15 by a graphical display generated by a software program. This aspect of the invention may also be used in audio systems which have no display associated with them.<br>
In  another  embodiment,  when  the  source  category  is broadcast radio, tuning keys 128 of the control panel (FIG. 5) 0   and the corresponding buttons 147 on remote control 17 are used in the conventional manner, that is, to change the tuning frequency of AM/FM tuner 12.<br>
FIGS. 9A, 9B, 9C and 9D are schematic circuit diagrams of circuitry in a radio  in an exemplary embodiment  of  the<br>
25 invention implementing AM-FM tuner 16, audio signal processing circuit 14 and control electronic circuitry 16 in the system<br><br>
