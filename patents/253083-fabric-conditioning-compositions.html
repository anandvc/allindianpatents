FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2OO7/000898<br><br>
FABRIC CONDITIONING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
5  The present invention relates to fabric conditioning<br>
compositions.  More specifically, the invention relates to fabric softening compositions comprising ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds that exhibit good rheological stability. 10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Liquid fabric conditioning compositions which soften fabrics in the rinse cycle are known.<br>
15<br>
Such compositions comprise less than 7.5% by weight of softening active, in which case the composition is defined as "dilute", from 7.5% to about 30% by weight of active in which case the compositions are defined as "concentrated" or<br>
20  more than about 30% by weight of active, in which case the composition is defined as "super-concentrated".<br>
Concentrated and super-concentrated compositions are desirable since these require less packaging and are 25  therefore environmentally more compatible than dilute or semi-dilute compositions.<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
A problem frequently associated with fabric conditioning compositions, as defined above, is that the product is not stable upon storage, especially when stored at high temperatures.  Instability can manifest itself as a 5  thickening of the product upon storage, even to the point that the product is no longer pourable.<br>
The problem of thickening upon storage is particularly apparent in concentrated and super concentrated fabric 10  softening compositions comprising an ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material having one or more fully saturated alkyl chains.<br>
However, it is desirable to use ester-linked compounds due 15  to their inherent biodegradability and to use substantially fully saturated quaternary ammonium fabric softening compounds due to their excellent softening capabilities and because they are more stable to oxidative degradation (which can lead to malodour"generation) than partially saturated or 20  fully unsaturated quaternary ammonium softening compounds.<br>
Of the types of ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials known, it is desirable to use those based on triethanolamine which comprise at least some mono-ester linked component and 25  at least some tri-ester linked component.<br>
A further problem known to affect concentrated and super-concentrated fabric softening compositions is that the<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
initial viscosity of a fully formulated composition can be very high, up to a point that the composition is substantially unpourable.<br>
5  The problem of undesirably high initial viscosity and visco-stability upon storage has previously keen addressed in various ways.<br>
For instance, EP-A2-0415698 (Unilever) discloses the use of 0  electrolytes, polyelectrolytes, or decoupling polymers to reduce the initial viscosity of fabric softening compositions.<br>
It is also known that an input of energy such as milling or 5  shearing of the product can reduce product viscosity.<br>
However, compositions produced by both of these approaches can suffer from colloidal instability.  Also, milling or shearing products in a manufacturing process on an industrial scale is time consuming and expensive. 0<br>
DE 2503026 (Hoechst) discloses formulations comprising 3-12% of a softener (a mixture of non-ester tjuaternary ammonium compounds imidazoline group containing compounds), 1-6% of a cationic disinfectant, 0.1-5% of a lower alcohol, 0.5-5% of 5  a fatty alcohol and 0-5% of a non-ionic emulsifier.<br>
WO 99/50378 (Unilever) relates to compositions comprising from 1 to 8% of a quaternary ammonium compound, a<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
stabilising agent and a fatty alcohol.  The fatty alcohol is present in order to thicken the dilute composition.<br>
WO03/022970 discloses a fabric conditioning composition<br>
5  comprising:<br>
(a)	from 7.5 to 80% by weight of an ester-linked<br>
quaternary ammonium fabric softening material comprising<br>
at least one mono-ester component and at<br>
10      least one tri-ester component;<br>
(b)	from 0.01 to 10% by weight of a non-ionic<br>
surfactant; and<br>
15      (c) greater than 1.5% to 15% by weight of a fatty complexing agent;<br>
wherein the weight ratio of the mono-ester component of compound (a) to compound (c) is from 5:1 to 1:5.<br>
20<br>
It is stated it has surprisingly been found that by incorporating a fatty component which comprises a long alkyl chain, such as fatty alcohols or fatty acids (hereinafter referred to as "fatty complexing agents") together with a<br>
25  non-ionic surfactant into softening compositions comprising a quaternary ammonium softening material having substantially fully saturated alkyl chains, at least some mono-ester linked component and at least some tri-ester<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
linked component, where the fatty complexing agent is present in an amount significantly greater than normally present in traditional fabric softening compositions, then the stability and initial viscosity of the composition can 5  be dramatically improved.  In particular, undesirable<br>
thickening of the composition upon storage can be avoided.<br>
The reference discloses that typical components in the ESTERQUAT material include mono-ester 10-30%, di-ester 20-10  60%, tri-ester 10-30%, free fatty acid 0.2-1.0%.  There is no disclosure of the free amine content.<br>
Similar disclosures are found in WO03/022969, WO03/022971, WO03/022972, WO03/022697 and EP1323818. 15<br>
Other patents have addressed the distribution of the ester components in the quaternary ammonium softening agent.<br>
US 6323167 discloses a textile softening composition which 20  comprises, as a softening agent, a quaternary ammonium salt which comprises a mixture of mono-, di- and tri-ester components wherein the amount of a di-ester quaternary is greater than 55% by weight and the amount of tri-ester quaternary is less than 20% by weight based  the total 25  amount of quaternary ammonium salt. There is no disclosure of the free amine content.<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
WO93/23510 discloses concentrated fabric softening compositions in which the di-ester component is at least 80% and the mono-ester component is up to 20%.  It is stated for softening, the percentage of di-ester should be as high as 5  possible, preferably more than 90%.<br>
WO91/01295 discloses quaternary ammonium compounds with amino-ester function which are used as textile softeners. The compounds disclosed have different ester distributions, 10  the mono-ester content ranging from 10 to 24%, the di-ester content ranging from 40 to 62% and the tri-ester content ranging from 26 to 4 3%.<br>
Generally, the esterquats are prepared by reaction of a 15  fatty acid with a trialkanolamine, e.g. triethanolamine, and then quaternised e.g. with di-methyl sulphate.  The ratio of fatty acid to triethanolamine affects the distribution of the resulting mono-, di- and tri-esters-  However, the quaternisation stage also affects the distribution because a 20  proportion of the tri-ester amine is not quarternised due to steric hindrance and remains as a free amine.<br>
W093/25648 discloses fabric softening compositions comprising quaternary ammonium salts containing at least 1 25  reverse ester linkage.  The compositions are substantially<br>
free of amines, since free amines can catalyse decomposition of the quarternised ester-amine softening compounds on storage.<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
It has now been found that the visco stability of a fabric composition can be controlled by a particular selection of the ester distribution and by maintaining low levels of ester amine and free fatty acid. 5<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a 10      fabric softening composition comprising from 1 to 80% by<br>
weight of ester-linked quaternary ammonium fabric softening material comprising a quaternised mixture of mono- di- and tri-ester of alkanolamine in which the tri-ester content of said mixture is from 25 to 50% by weight of said mixture, 15  wherein:<br>
(i)  when the tri-ester content is from 25 to 30% by weight of said mixture the free amine content of the -. composition is less than 0.5% by weight on the weight of 20  said mixture,<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The compositions of the present invention are preferably 5  rinse conditioner compositions, more preferably aqueous<br>
rinse conditioner compositions for use in the rinse cycle of a domestic laundry process.<br>
10  Quaternary ammonium fabric softening material<br>
The fabric conditioning material used in the compositions of the present invention comprises quaternary ammonium materials comprising a mixture of mono-ester di-ester and 15  tri-ester components wherein the tri-ester component is from 25 to 50% by weight of the mixture.<br>
By mono-, di- and tri-ester linked components, it is meant that the quaternary ammonium softening material comprises,<br>
20  respectively, a quaternary ammonium compound comprising a single ester-link with a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto, a quaternary ammonium compound comprising two ester-links each of which has a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto, and a quaternary ammonium compound<br>
25  comprising three ester-links each of which has a fatty hydrocarbyl chain attached thereto.<br><br><br>
-  9  -<br>
Preferably, the average chain length of the alkyl or alkenyl group is at least C14, more preferably at least C16<br>
It is generally preferred if the alkyl or alkenyl chains are 5  predominantly linear.<br>
The preferred ester-linked quaternary ammonium cationic softening material for use in the invention is represented by formula (I):<br>

[(CH2)n(TR)]m<br>
R'-NT-E (CH2)n{OH) ]3-m	(Formula I)<br>

PCT/EP2007/000898<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
Especially preferred materials within this class are esters of triethanol ammonium methyl sulphate, particularly tallow or hardened tallow esters. 5<br>
The tri-esterquat content of the fabric conditioning material is from 25 to 50% by weight. This tri-esterquat content can be provided in a variety of ways, as by using a relatively high ratio of the fatty acid to the starting<br>
10 alkanolamine in the reaction mixture, using an optimal amount of a suitable catalyst in the reaction mixture for promoting triester formation, raising the temperature of the reaction mixture relatively slowly, and other expedients known to the skilled person.<br>
15<br>
The contemplated di-esterquat content of the esterquat mixture is at most 70%, optionally at most 60%, optionally at most 50%, optionally at most 40% optionally at most 30% by weight of the esterquat mixture.   The contemplated di-<br>
20 esterquat content of the esterquat mixture is at least 30%, optionally at least 4 0%, optionally at least 50%, optionally at most 55%r optionally at least 60%, optionally at least 65% by weight of the esterquat mixture.<br>
25 The weight percentages of the mono-, di-, and tri-esterquats in the esterquat mixture are reported on the basis of the total weight of the three. Thus, the sum of these three percentages is 100%.  The weight percentages of free amine<br><br>
WO 2007/090567<br><br>
PCTYEP2007/000898<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
and fatty acid in the esterquat mixture are also stated here based on the total weight of mono-, di-, and tri-esterquats in the esterquat mixture. In practice it has been found that higher tri-ester contents can tolerate more free amine 5 content in the composition without deleteriously affecting visco stability. When the tri-ester content is from 25 to 30% by weight the free amine content of the composition should be as low as possible and below 0.5% by weight. When the tri-ester content is greater than 30% by weight 10 additional free amine may be tolerated in the composition providing it does not amount to more than 6% by weight of the mixture.<br>
The free (i.e. unquaternized) amine content may be adjusted<br>
15  by controlling the reaction conditions of the preparation of<br>
the esterquats,  for example,  (1) by charging a suitable<br>
amount of quaternising agent close to a 1:1 molar ratio of<br>
amines  to  quaternizing agent,  (2)  by carrying  out  the<br>
reaction long enough to consume the desired percentage of<br>
20  free amine present at the beginning of the quaternisation<br>
reaction, or (3) by selecting a suitable quaternising agent<br>
(for   example,   dimethyl   sulphate   is   contemplated).<br>
Alternatively and/or in addition,  an acid may be added<br>
toward the end of the preparation of the esterquats and/or<br>
25  during  the  preparation  of  the  fabric  conditioning<br>
composition to reduce the free amine content.<br><br><br>

The compositions contain less than 1% by weight of free fatty acid based on the fabric conditioning material. A low free fatty acid content can be provided, for example, by reacting a fatty acid or a parent fatty acyl compound (such 5 as a glyceride, alkyl ester, or acid chloride) and trialkanolamine under conditions, such as a low enough ratio of fatty acid to trialkanolamine and a long enough reaction time at elevated temperature, effective to consume at least 99% of the initial charge of fatty acid or parent. 10<br>
References to percentage by weight of the mixture refer to amounts based on the weight of the raw fabric softening material which comprises a mixture of the esters.<br>
15  Iodine Value of the Parent Fatty Acyl group or Acid<br>
The iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 20, preferably from 0 to 5, more<br>
20  preferably from 0 to 2.  Most preferably the iodine value of the parent fatty acid or acyl group from which the quaternary ammonium fabric softening material is formed is from 0 to 1.  That is, it is preferred that the alkyl or alkenyl chains are substantially fully saturated.<br>
25<br>
If  there  is  any unsaturated quaternary  ammonium fabric softening material present   in  the  composition,   the  iodine<br>

value, referred to above, represents the mean iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compounds or fatty acids of all of the quaternary ammonium materials present.<br>
5  In the context of the present invention, iodine value of the parent fatty acyl compound or acid from which the fabric softening material formed, is defined as the number of grams of iodine which react with 100 grams of the compound.<br>
10  In the context of the present invention, the method for calculating the iodine value of a parent fatty acyl compound/acid comprises dissolving a prescribed amount {from 0.1-3g) into about 15ml chloroform.  The dissolved parent fatty acyl compound/fatty acid is then reacted with 25 ml of<br>
15  iodine monochloride in acetic acid solution (O.1M).  To<br>
this, 20ml of 10% potassium iodide solution and about 150 ml deionised water is added. After addition of the halogen has taken place, the excess of iodine monochloride is determined by titration with sodium thiosulphate solution (0.1M) in the<br>
20  presence of a blue starch indicator powder.  At the same time a blank is determined with the same quantity of reagents and under the same conditions.  The difference between the volume of sodium thiosulphate used in the blank and that used in the reaction with the parent fatty acyl<br>
25  compound or fatty acid enables the iodine value to be calculated.<br><br>

Broadly speaking, the conditioning active compositions of the present invention, also known as esterquats, are made by combining a fatty acid source and an alkanolamine, typically<br>
10 at a starting temperature at which the fatty acid source is molten, optionally adding a catalyst, then heating the reaction mixture while drawing vacuum until the desired endpoint(s), such as acid value and final alkalinity value, are reached-  The resulting esteramine intermediate is then<br>
15 quaternised using an alkylating agent, yielding an esterquat product. The esterquat product is a mixture of quaternised monoester, diester, and triester components and optionally some amount of one or more reactants, intermediates, and byproducts, including but not limited to free amine and free<br>
20  fatty acid or  parent fatty acyl compounds.<br>

The fatty complexing agent is present in an amount greater than 0.2% to 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.  More preferably, the fatty component is 10  present in an amount of from 0.25 to 5%, most preferably from 0.3 to 1% by weight.<br>
Nonionic surfactant<br>
15  Although it is not preferred, the compositions may optionally further comprise a non-ionic surfactant. Typically these can be included for the purpose of stabilising the compositions.<br>
20  Suitable non-ionic surfactants include addition products of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide with fatty alcohols.<br>
Any of the alkoxylated materials of the particular type described hereinafter can be used as the non-ionic 25  surfactant.<br>
