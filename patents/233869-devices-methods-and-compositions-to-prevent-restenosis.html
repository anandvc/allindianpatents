				<td>DEVICES, METHODS, AND COMPOSITIONS TO PREVENT RESTENOSIS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Atherosclerosis is the formation of a hardened plaque comprising cholesterol, fatty<br>
acids, cellular wastes, and calcium along the walls of medium and large arteries. Such<br>
plaques can cause a narrowing ("stenosis") of a blood vessel, such as a medium or<br>
large artery, and is a leading cause of heart attack and stroke. Typically,<br>
atherosclerosis is treated using balloon angioplasty (also called Percutaneous<br>
Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty or "PTCA") in which a catheter is inserted in a<br>
major artery of the patient and is guided to a major artery of the heart. A balloon<br>
located in the distal end of the catheter is inflated to push the plaque against the wall<br>
of the constricted vessel, thus widening the vessel and improving blood flow. More<br>
recently, small metallic spring-like devices called stents can be inserted at the point of<br>
construction to provide a supporting framework that maintains the shape of the vessel.<br>
Unfortunately, these procedures do not always provide permanent solutions. In about<br>
40% of all PTCA procedures and about 25% of stentings, the stenosis recurs within<br>
about six months of the procedure. Such recurrence is called "restenosis", and, in the<br>
case of restenosis following stent insertion ("in-stent restenosis"). In-stent restenosis<br>
occurs when scar tissue grows under the layer of otherwise healthy vessel tissue that<br>
grows over the framework of the stent and provides improved blood flow through the<br>
stent to a degree sufficient to restrict blood flow through the stented segment of the<br>
vessel.<br>
Recently, specially coated drug-eluting stents that include a cytotoxic agent have been<br>
provided to reduce the occurrence of in-stent restenosis. A variety of drugs have been<br>
used in such stents, including sirolimus (rapamycin), which inhibits growth of smooth<br>
muscle cells ("SMCs"), paclitaxel, an antiproliferative agent, and several anti-<br>
inflammatory drugs. See, for example: Ozaki et al., (1996), "New stent technologies,"<br>

Patent No. 6,231,600 to Zhong describes a hybrid stent coating including a<br>
non-thrombogenic agent and paclitaxel-containing polymer that allows time-release<br>
of the paclitaxel to reduce or prevent in-stent restenosis. U.S Patent application<br>
20030207856 discloses stents coated with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin.<br>
Nevertheless, it would be advantageous to provide additional drug-eluting stents<br>
having different restenosis-preventing or reducing agents. For example, paclitaxel has<br>
such great cytotoxicity that necrosis of the vessel wall has been observed. Thus,<br>
paclitaxel has relatively narrow therapeutic window that can complicate formulation<br>
and administration.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses these needs by providing compositions, methods, and<br>
devices that substantially reduce or prevent restenosis. We have unexpectedly found<br>
that certain geldanamycin analogs, particularly the 17-amino-17-desmethoxy-<br>
geldanamycins such as 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and<br>
17-(dimethylaminoethyl)-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (DMAG), display selective<br>
cytotoxicity against smooth muscle cells and hence provide unique advantages for use<br>
in controlling restenosis. Further, we have discovered that particular combinations of<br>
cytotoxic drags are unexpectedly synergistic, thus reducing the concentrations of the<br>
individual cytotoxic drugs needed to prevent restenosis.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention includes a medical device configured to deliver<br>
one or more drugs described herein to a blood vessel to reduce the degree or<br>
substantially prevent the occurrence of restenosis in the blood vessel. In one<br>
embodiment, the drug is an epothilone. In another embodiment, the drug is a<br>
geldanamycin derivative. In still another embodiment, the drug is a rapamycin analog.<br>
In a more particular embodiment, the drug is a desoxyepothilone, and, more<br>
particularly, epothilone D. In another embodiment, the drug is<br>
17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin, 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-<br>
17-desmethoxy geldanamycin, or 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-17-desmethoxy-<br>
11-O-methylgeldanamycin. In yet another embodiment, the drug is<br>
17-azetidinyl-17-desmethoxy-geldanamycin. In some embodiments, the above-<br>
described drugs are used in combination to provide a synergistic effect. In some<br>
embodiments, the drug or drugs described herein is further combined with an anti-<br>
inflammatory. In some embodiments, the device is a stent. In other embodiments, the<br>
device is a polymer wrapper or device used to cover vascular anastomoses. In some<br>
embodiments, the device includes at least one coating effective to deliver one or more<br>
drugs described herein to a blood vessel.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides compositions to reduce the degree or<br>
substantially prevent the occurrence of restenosis in the blood vessel. In one<br>
embodiment, the drug is an epothilone. In another embodiment, the drug is<br>
geldanamycin or a geldanamycin derivative. In still another embodiment, the drug is a<br>
rapamycin analog. In a more particular embodiment, the drug is a desoxyepothilone,<br>
and, more particularly, epothilone D. In another embodiment, the drug is<br>
17-allylamino-l7-desmethoxygeldanamycin, 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-<br>
17-desmethoxy-geldanamycin, or 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]- 17-desmethoxy-<br>
11-O-methylgeldanamycin. In yet another embodiment, the drug is 17-azetidinyl-<br>
17-desmethoxy geldanamycin. In some embodiments, the drug or drugs described<br>
herein is further combined with an anti-inflammatory agent. The composition can<br>
include a polymer such that the drug of the invention elutes from the polymer into<br>
blood vessel tissues proximal to the polymer<br>
In still another aspect, the present invention provides methods to to reduce the degree<br>
or substantially prevent the occurrence of restenosis in the blood vessel. In one<br>
embodiment, the method of the invention includes delivering a drug described herein<br>
to a blood vessel requiring treatment for, or prevention of, restenosis, in an amount<br>
sufficient to substantially reduce, or substantially prevent, restenosis in such blood<br>
vessel. In one embodiment, the drug is an epothilone. In another embodiment, the<br>
drug is geldanamycin or a geldanamycin derivative. In still another embodiment, the<br>
drug is a rapamycin analog. In a more particular embodiment, the drug is a<br>
desoxyepothilone, and, more particularly, epothilone D. In another embodiment, the<br>
drug is 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin, 17-[2-(dimethylamino)-<br>
ethylamino]-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin, or 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-<br>

combination of total chemical synthesis, partial chemical synthesis, or<br>
chemobiosynthesis methods and materials known to those of skill in organic<br>
chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and biotechnology arts. Specific examples of<br>
epothilones having useful therapeutic properties include, but are not limited to,<br>
epothilone A, epothilone B, epothilone C, epothilone D, 4-desmethylepothilone D,<br>

19-oxazolyl-10,11-dehydroepothilone D, and trans-9,10-dehydroepothilone D.<br>
In another embodiment, the drug is geldanamycin or an analog or derivative thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the drug is geldanamycin. In preferred embodiments, the drug is<br>
an analog of geldanamycin, for example a 17-(substituted amino)-17-<br>
desmethoxygeldanamycin. In one preferred embodiment, the drug is<br>
17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin ("17-AAG"). In still another<br>
embodiment, the drug is 17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-17-desmethoxy-<br>
geldanamycin ("17-DMAG"). In another embodiment, the drug is<br>
17-[2-(dimethylamino)ethylamino]-17-desmethoxy-11-O-methylgeldanamycin. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the drug is 17-azetidinyl-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin. These<br>
compounds can be obtained using methods known to those having skill in the organic<br>
and medicinal chemistry arts; see, for example, Sasaki et al. (1981) U.S. Patent<br>
4,261,989; Schnur et al. (1999) U.S. Patent 5,932,566; Zhang et al. (2003) PCT<br>
Publication WO 03/026571; Santi et al. (2003) PCT Publication WO 03/13430, as<br>
well as in co-pending U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos.: 60/389,225; 60/393,929;<br>
60/395,275; 60/415,326; and 60/420,820.<br>
While geldanamycin itself is a potent cytotoxin, with IC50 values for smooth muscle<br>
cells of approximately 0.9 nM, such high cytotoxicity may be problematic for the<br>
treatment of restenosis where the localized drug concentrations can be high. For<br>
effective treatment of restenosis, a drug showing selective cytotoxicity against smooth<br>
muscle cells over endothelial cells, for example, would allow treatment of restenosis<br>
with minimal damage to other cell types not involved in restenosis. We have<br>
unexpectedly found that certain geldanamycin analogs, particularly the 17-amino~17-<br>
desmethoxy-geldanamycins such as 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-<br>
AAG) and 17-(dimethylaminoethyl)-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (DMAG), display<br>
selective cytotoxicity against smooth muscle cells (see Figures 1 and 2). While these<br>
analogs are generally less cytotoxic than geldanamycin itself, 17-AAG for example<br>
shows an IC50 of about 10 nM against smooth muscle cells, they show substantially<br>
higher IC50 values against endothelial cells. Thus, these analogs offer unexpected<br>
advantages over geldanamycin itself in the treatment of restenosis.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the drug is rapamycin or a rapamycin analog.<br>
By "rapamycin or a rapamycin analog" is meant a compound of structure (I),<br>
wherein R1 is hydroxy, alkoxy, hydroxyethoxy, aryloxy, or heteroaryl; R2 is H or<br>
OMe; R3 is H or Me; and R4 is H, OH, or OMe. Specific examples of rapamycin<br>
analogs are described in PCT Publication WO 01/38416.<br>
In preferred embodiments, rapamycin or a rapamycin analog is administered in<br>
combination with a second drug to provide a synergistic cytotoxic effect on smooth<br>
muscle cells. Examples of synergistic combinations include rapamycin with a<br>
geldanamycin analog, as illustrated for rapamycin and 17-AAG in Figure 4, and<br>
rapamycin with epothilone D, as demonstrated in Figure 5. The use of synergistic<br>
mixtures is highly advantageous, as it allows use of lower drug loadings and/or<br>
increased effectiveness at preventing restenosis. The ratios of the two drugs may be<br>
determined by methods known in the art, for example as described below in Example<br>
2.<br>
In some embodiments, the drug or drug combination is combined with a stent so that<br>
the process of restenosis is substantially mitigated or prevented. Such stents may be<br>
metallic or made of a bioresorbable polymer. Examples of stents suitable with the<br>
present invention include, but are not limited to, stents configured to elute a drug as<br>
are known to those of skill in the cardiovascular medicine and medical device arts.<br>

In other embodiments, the stent is coated with one or more polymer substances to<br>
facilitate blood flow over the stent surfaces and to provide a reservoir of the drug such<br>
that the drug is released to provide substantial mitigation or prevention of restenosis.<br>
Examples of such polymer are known to those of skill in the cardiovascular medicine<br>
and medical device arts; see, for example, Levy et al. (1994) "Strategies for treating<br>

In preferred embodiments, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of<br>
poly(ester-amides) ("PEA"), polylactides ("PLA"), and amino acid-based<br>
polyurethanes ("PU"). Suitable poly (ester-amides) are described in Lee et al. (2002)<br>
"In-vivo biocompatibility evaluation of stents coated with a new biodegradable<br>
elastomeric and functional polymer," Coron Artery Dis. 2002 Jun;13(4):237-41; and<br>
U.S. Patent 6,703,040, which is incorporated herein by reference, and are prepared by<br>
synthesizing monomers of two alpha amino acids with diols and diacids. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the poly(ester-amide) is prepared from L-leucine, L-lysine, hexanediol,<br>
and sebacic acid. The drugs can be chemically deposited into the polymer matrix or<br>
conjugated onto the polymer backbone via the carboxyl groups of the L-lysine. The<br>
polymer is elastomeric and can be crosslinked in situ using photo activators, resulting<br>
in a strong yet biocompatible and reabsorbable polymer. The polylactide-based<br>
polymers can be made from L-lactide, caprolactone, and polyethylene glycol<br>
monomers in varying ratios. The polyurethane polymers can be made by condensing<br>
monomers of alpha amino acids, such as L-leucine and L-lysine, with a diol. The<br>
carboxyl groups of lateral L-lysine on the polymer can be used as an attachment site<br>
for coupling drugs. The polyurethane polymers generally show a faster degradation<br>
rate than the poly(ester-amide) polymers, and are generally similar in terms of<br>
biocompatibility and reabsorbability.<br>
When used for coating medical devices, for example stents, solutions of the polymer<br>
and drug in volatile solvents, either individually or in combination, may be applied to<br>
the surface by spraying or by dipping. The volatile solvents are then allowed to<br>
evaporate, resulting in a coating on the device comprising the polymer and the drug.<br>
Varying proportions of polymer and drug may be applied, depending upon the<br>
potency of the drug and the time period over which the drug is to be released from the<br>
medical device. To further control the rate of release of the drug, a topcoat of<br>
additional polymer may be applied to the coated device. The medical devices may<br>
subsequently be rendered aseptic, for example by gamma irradiation.<br>
In another embodiment, the drug or drugs described herein can be used with a medical<br>
device to prevent restenosis after vascular anastomosis, for example by being<br>
combined with a polymer sheath or wrapping around the vessel wall. Such materials<br>
are available commercially from Secant Medical, LLC of Perkasie, Pennsylvania,<br>
USA. Further examples of suitable devices that may be coated with the compositions<br>
of the invention may be found, for example in U.S. Patent 6,371,965. These devices<br>
may be useful particularly after vascular anastomosis such as occurs during coronary<br>
artery bypass graft surgery.<br>
In other embodiments, one or more anti-inflammatory drugs effective to reduce or<br>
prevent inflammatory processes from occurring in the vessel wall is included with the<br>
drug or drugs described herein above. Examples of suitable anti-inflammatory drugs<br>
include, but are not limited to, rapamycin and rapamycin analogs described in<br>
WO 01/38416.<br>
In other embodiments, one or more of the drugs described above are deposited<br>
directly to the site of restenosis. Deposition can be accomplished using, e.g., a<br>
catheter or suitable drug delivery device.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples are provided to illustrate certain aspects of the present<br>
invention and to aid those of skill in the art in the art in practicing the invention.<br>
These Examples are in no way to be considered to limit the scope of the invention in<br>
any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Demonstration that Compounds of the Invention Prevent or Reduce Processes<br>
Associated with Restenosis<br>
Compounds of the invention demonstrate activities consistent with the prevention or<br>
reduction of cellular mechanisms associated with restenosis, as shown hereinbelow.<br>
Thus, the compounds, methods, and devices of the invention will be recognized by<br>
those of skill in the cardiovascular medicine arts as being effective to substantially<br>
prevent or reduce restenosis.<br>
The effects of varying drug concentrations of paclitaxel, rapamycin, and a drug<br>
selected from the group consisting of epothilone D, 17-AAG, and 17-DMAG on<br>
growth characteristics for the same human smooth muscle cells ("SMCs" and<br>
endothelial cells ("ECs") were compared under in-vitro experimental conditions as<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
Human aortic smooth muscle cells ("AoSMCs") and human umbilical vein<br>
endothelial cells ("HUVECs") were plated on 96-well culture plates at a density of<br>
about 10,000 cells per square centimeter (10,000 cells/cm2). The density was<br>
determined using growth curves determined by calculating the average absolute<br>
optical densities ("ODs", defined as cellular OD - media only OD) for each plating<br>
concentration, for each day, and each cell type (AoSMC or HUVEC) over a five-day<br>
time period. The AoSMCs were purchased frozen from<br>
Clonetics/Biowhittaker/Cambrex (Item # CC-2571 / Lot # 0F0222 ). The AoSMCs<br>
had company-determined culture characteristics on arrival: a total cell number of<br>
917,500; cell viability: 95%; and a doubling time of between about twenty-four and<br>
forty-eight hours. Pooled HUVECs were also purchased in frozen aliquot from<br>
Clonetics/Biowhittaker/Cambrex (Item # CC-2519 / Lot # 1F0832). The<br>
company-determined culture characteristics on arrival were: a total Cell number of<br>
560,000; cell viability of 83%; and a doubling time of between about eighteen and<br>
about forty-eight hours.<br>
Prior to experiments, the AoSMCs and HUVECS were thawed and independently<br>
propagated through two- or three population doublings following Clonetics<br>
recommendations and standard cell culture techniques. Clonetics Growth Media and<br>
Reagents were used without alteration in all aspects of the study described herein<br>
unless otherwise noted. The details of the media and reagents can be found at the<br>
Cambrex World-Wide Web site. SMGM contained: 500 ml SMBM-2 basal media,<br>
5% FBS, and all recommended singlequot growth supplements (provided with<br>
SMGM-2 bulletkit) ECGM contained: 500 ml EBM basal media, 2% FBS, and all<br>
recommended singlequot growth supplements (provided with EGM-bulletkit).<br>
After initial plating all 96-well plates were placed in a standard 37Â°C, 5% CO2<br>
incubator. Conditions, including media, were not changed except as detailed below.<br>
For consecutive 24-hour time-periods, from Day 1 to Day 5, a single 96-well plate<br>
was removed from the incubator. For this plate, culture media was removed from all<br>
wells and replaced with 100 microliters ("Âµl") of MTS reagent/media solution (see<br>
below) and the plate was then placed back in the incubator 3-4 hours later this plate<br>
was removed from the incubator and optical density data for each well was obtained<br>
using a 96-well ELISA reader.<br>
Cell Preparation Source cells were selected at 70-80 % confluency of the second or<br>
third population doubling since initial thaw. In order to synchronize cell cycle, source<br>
cells were changed from standard growth media to media containing 1% serum<br>
twenty-four hours prior to experiment (other growth factors were unchanged). On<br>
Day 0 of the experiment, source cells were removed from culture dishes by<br>
trypsinization (0.05 x 1 min.-2 min), quantified by hemacytometer after centrifuge<br>
(800 RPM x 5 min.), and re-suspended in media to obtain a stock solution of about<br>
25,000 cells/ml.<br>
The drugs were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide ("DMSO") solvent to make stock<br>
solutions, which were then diluted serially in media to three study concentrations<br>
(10 nM; 100 nM; and 1,000 nM). The drugs at three concentration each, solvent<br>
without drug at three concentrations, and standard media were added independently to<br>
cells on the first day of the study only. Cells in two columns (16 wells) for each cell<br>
type on each day will not receive drug and serve as internal controls. Cellular viability<br>
and proliferation was assessed using the MTS assay for each cell type at each of the<br>
six time points. Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich as a 1 mg powder<br>
(Item # R0395). Paclitaxel was purchased from Sigma Aldrich as a 5 mg powder<br>
(Item # T7191). Epothilone D, 17-AAG, and 17-DMAG were obtained using the<br>
methods and materials described above.<br>
On Day 1, six hours after initial plating, the media was removed from all wells by<br>
vacuum suction; and with the appropriate growth media-drug solution for each of<br>
three drugs at three concentrations described above was added to the wells. For each<br>
cell type (AoSMC or HUVEC), and on each day, two 96-well plates were required to<br>
incorporate all three drugs (24 total plates). Standard wells contained only media and<br>
were used for optical density ("OD") control in each individual plate during analysis.<br>
Control wells contained the plate specific cells without drug or solvent, and served as<br>
the control for all drug effects on a given day for a given cell type.<br>
For consecutive 24 hour time-periods, from Day 0 to Day 5, four 96-well plates were<br>
removed from the incubator (two plates each for AoSMCs and HUVECs). For these<br>
plates, the culture media was removed from all wells and replaced with 100 Âµl of<br>
MTS reagent solution, which contained 20 Âµl of Promega CellTiter 96 Aqueous One<br>
reagent in 80 Âµl of cell appropriate growth media for each well. Promega<br>
recommendations for assay use were followed throughout including reagent<br>
administration under dark lighting 3-4 hours later these plates were removed from the<br>
incubator and optical density data for each well or each plate was obtained using a 96-<br>
well automated ELISA reader. Plates were read within 1.5 hrs of the same time each<br>
day. Additional details for the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Assay are available online at<br>
the Promega World-Wide Web site.<br>
Optical Densities for each column were averaged (n = 8). Using the MTS assay steps<br>
detailed above, the "standard" wells contained only MTS reagent in media at the time<br>
of analysis. The average OD values for these "standard" columns were then<br>
subtracted from those column averages of drug treated cells, in order to obtain an<br>
absolute OD for drug treated cells. The average OD values for the "standard"<br>
columns were also subtracted from those columns containing control cells in order to<br>
obtain an absolute OD for control cells.<br>
Average absolute OD s for cells at a given drug concentration were plotted for Days<br>
0-5 for both AoSMCs and HUVECs. Average absolute OD s for AoSMC and<br>
HUVEC control cells were plotted on the same respective graphs for Days 0-5.<br>
The results of the study are shown in Figures 1 and 2. From the figures, those of skill<br>
in the pharmacology and medicine arts will understand that epothilone D, 17-AAG,<br>
and 17-DMAG each shows dose-response characteristics consistent with utility to<br>
reduce or prevent restenosis. Moreover, those of such skill will also understand from<br>
the data presented that 17-AAG, and 17-DMAG each shows relative selectivity for<br>
SMCs over ECs. Thus, the present invention also provides treatment methods and<br>
compositions that are relatively selective for SMCs over ECs.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Demonstration of Synergistic Effects With Anti-Inflammatory Compounds<br>
Human aortic smooth muscle cells were obtained from Cambrex (Walkersville, MD).<br>
The cells were maintained in SmGM-2 growth medium (Cambrex). Rapamycin, 17-<br>
AAG, and KOS-862 were obtained as described above or from commercial sources.<br>
The compounds were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide ("DMSO") to a concentration of<br>
10 mM and stored at -20Â°C.<br>
The cells were seeded in duplicate, in opaque-walled 96-well microtiter plates at a<br>
cell density of 3,000 cells per well and allowed to attach overnight. Serial dilutions of<br>
each drug were added, and the cells were incubated for 96 hours. The IC50 values for<br>
the drugs was determined using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay<br>
(Promega, Madison, WI), which correlates with the number of live cells.<br>
For the drug combination assays, the cells were seeded in duplicate in 96-well plates<br>
(3,000 cells/well). After an overnight incubation, the cells were treated with drug<br>
alone or a combination of the drug and rapamycin. Based on the IC50 values of each<br>
individual drug, combined drug treatments were designed to provide constant ratios of<br>
the two drugs being tested for synergistic effect, i.e., at a concentration equivalent to<br>
the ratio of their individual IC50 values. Three different treatment schedules were<br>
used: The cells were treated with rapamycin and 17-AAG; or rapamycin and KOS-<br>
862 simultaneously for 96 hours. Cell viability was determined by luminescent assay<br>
(Promega). Combination analysis was performed by using Calcusyn software<br>
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).<br>
Each of the combinations of rapamycin and 17-AAG and rapamycin and KOS-862<br>
was found to be synergistic as shown in Figures 4 and 5. Thus, each of these two<br>
combinations is likely to have better pharmacological effect in preventing or treating<br>
restenosis than the effect of either component alone. Synergy was also demonstrated<br>
using the procedure described above in DLD-1 cells (Figures 6 and 7).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In Vitro Drug Elution of 17-AAG Matrixed PEA<br>
The elution of 17-AAG from representative poly (ester-amide) coated stainless<br>
steel disks was determined by UV and HPLC methods. Stainless steel disks (0.71<br>
cm") were coated with polymer and 17-AAG by pipetting solutions of PEA-24-Bz<br>
and 17-AAG in absolute ethanol onto the disks and air drying overnight. In some<br>
cases, the coated disks were further topcoated with either PEA-24 or PEA-17, and<br>
then dried using the same techniques. Total drug loads of 50, 100, or 200<br>
micrograms/cm2 were used, with a drug load of either 10 or 20% (w/w) versus<br>
polymer. For elution, the disks were placed in a 15 mL plastic vial containing 1.5 mL<br>
of medium consisting of either chymotrypsin (0.4 mg/mL), phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS), fetal bovine serum (FBS), or human serum. The vials were incubated at 37 Â°C,<br>
and the medium was sampled daily. Drug release was assayed by HPLC analysis of<br>
an aliquot pretreated by solid-phase extraction (see Example 4), or by the UV<br>
absorbance of the aliquot (200 ÂµL), extrapolated from a calibration curve made from<br>
drug standards. The UV assay gave results consistent with 96% of theoretical. The<br>
HPLC method entailed chromatography using a 250x4.6 mm 5 micron 100 A Zorbax<br>
Eclipse XDB C8 reversed-phase column with a 12.5 x 4.6 mm matching guard<br>
column. The mobile phases were A: 0.2% acetic acid in water, and B: 0.1% acetic<br>
acid in acetonitrile, flow rate 1 mL/min. A gradient elution was performed: 50%B for<br>
2 minutes, then 9 minutes to 95% B, then isocratic at 95% B for 5 min, then back to<br>
50% for 1 min and equilibrate for 4 min. 17-AAG was detected by UV at 330 nm.<br>
The release data for 17-AAG into chymotrypsin medium demonstrated that<br>
17-A AG is released at a sustained rate at least up to day 5, at which time the<br>
experiment terminated. Non-topcoated matrix released 17-AAG at a faster rate than<br>
topcoated matrix, with 56% total drug released over 5 days compared with 40% for<br>
the non-topcoated matrix.<br>
The release data for 17-AAG into FBS medium demonstrated that 17-AAG is<br>
is released at a sustained rate at least up to day 4.5, at which time the experiment<br>
terminated. Non-topcoated matrix released 17-AAG at a faster rate than topcoated<br>
matrix, with 31% total drug released over 4.5 days compared with 21% for the non-<br>
topcoated matrix.<br>
The effect of increased topcoating was studied using human serum medium.<br>
With a drug loading of 200 micrograms/cm2, a 200 microgram topcoat gave 16%<br>
release of 17-AAG after 24 hours in human serum, whereas both a 400 microgram<br>
and a 600 microgram topcoate gave 6-7% release. Thus, doubling the topcoat has a<br>
significant effect on 17-AAG release, wheras tripling the topcoat has no further effect.<br>
The solubility of 17-AAG in PBS is 60 micrograms/mL, and the IC50 for<br>
endothelial cells is 350 nM. These studies suggest a drug loading of at least 200<br>
micrograms of 17-AAG per stent with a 20-30% (w/w) drug/polymer formulation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Solid-Phase Extraction of Drugs from Serum<br>
Drug aliquots from serum experiments were subjected to solid-phase<br>
extraction by loaded onto the top of 3 mL Isolute HM-N solid phase extraction<br>
columns (Argonaut; San Carlos, California). After 5-10 minutes, the columns were<br>
eluted with 10-12 mL of chloroformdsopropanol (95/5 v/v) followed by 4 mL of ethyl<br>
acetate/isopropanol (95/5 v/v). The total eluate was concentrated, and the residues<br>
reconstituted and filtered through an 0.5 micron filter prior to HPLC analysis.<br>
Recovery of 17-AAG from the solid phase extraction was 88.7%. Recovery of<br>
epothilone D was 95-98%.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Release Kinetics of 17-AAG from Coated Stents in Porcine Serum<br>
Unmounted Metronic 'Driver' 18 x 3.5 mm stents were coated with<br>
MVPEA/17-AAG matrixed polymer material by spray coating. Three groups of<br>
stents were used in this study: (i) a low-dose group with 10% (w/w) drug load; these<br>
had 450 micrograms of polymer, 50 micrograms of 17-AAG, and 250 micrograms of<br>
topcoat; (ii) a high-dose group with 30% (w/w) drug load; mese had 150 micrograms<br>
of polymer, 150 micrograms of 17-AAG, and 250 micrograms of topcoat; and (iii) a<br>
control group coated with polymer only (700 micrograms). Coated stents were<br>
sterilized by gamma irradiation.<br>
Three stents from each group were placed aseptically into sterile glass vials<br>
and treated with 5 mL of sterile porcine serum at 37 Â°C with gentle agitation by<br>
shaking at 120 rpm. All 5 mL of serum was removed from each vial under sterile<br>
conditions at 0.5,2,4,6,12, and 24 hours, and then 2, 3,5,7, and 10 days. Fresh<br>
serum was added to the vials and incubation was continued after each time point. The<br>
time point aliquots were subjected to solid-phase extraction (see Example 4) prior to<br>
analysis by HPLC.<br>
These studies demonstrated that 17-AAG was released into porcine serum<br>
along with an apparent metabolite.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Release Kinetics of 17-AAG in Human Serum<br>
Stainless steel disks (0.71 cm2) coated on one side with PEA-17-AAG having<br>
a drug loading of 100 ug/cm2 (equal to 71 micrograms total 17-AAG) with either no<br>
topcoat or 210 ug, 420 ug, or 640 ug of a PEA topcoate (same as basecoat) were<br>
exposed to either human serum or chymotrypsin solution and 17-AAG was measured<br>
as described in Example 3. Results are given in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Release kinetics of 17-AAG in human serum. Percent of loaded drug found<br>
in serum as a function of the amount of topcoat polymer over a 14-day period.<br>
A disk coated with the PEA polymer exposed to chymotrypsin (0.4 mg/mL)<br>
showed increasing weight loss due to degradation of the polymer, with the PEA<br>
degradation by about 14% over 5 days and about 30% over 14 days. After 5 days in<br>
chymotrypsin solution, a drug-loaded disk released about 55%, indicating that drug<br>
release represents the combined effects of drug diffusion and matrix erosion.<br>
The advantages and qualities of the invention will be apparent from the foregoing<br>
discussion. The present invention provides useful methods, compositions, devices,<br>
and drugs for reducing or preventing restenosis. Moreover, the invention provides<br>
useful methods, compositions, devices, and drugs for reducing or preventing<br>
restenosis that are selective for smooth muscle cells over endothelial cells. Thus, the<br>
present invention will be appreciated by those of skill in the pharmacology and<br>
medicine arts to provide treatments and prophylactics for restenosis that have reduced<br>
