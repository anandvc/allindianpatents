The concept of a chemically inducible, reversible male sterility in plants by anther-specific expression of an N-acetylphosphinothricin (N-acetyl-PPT)-specific deacetylase is described in European Patent Application EP 531 716. The deacetylase genes from Streptomyces viridochromogenes [N-acetyl-L phosphinothricylalanylalanine (N-acetyl-PTT) deacetylase, dea] and argE from Escherichia coll (N-acetyl-L-ornithine deacetylase) used here encode proteins having specificity for N-acetyl-L-PPT. For both genes, it was possible in the case of tapetum-specific expression in plants to show the occurrence of male-sterile flowers after treatment of Individual buds with N-acetyl-L-PPT. For successful use of this system, in particular in the treatment of whole plants with N-acetyl-PPT under practically relevant conditions, it is advantageous to be able to employ deacetylases having high substrate affinity. Therefore further deacetylases having high affinity for N-acetyl-PPT were sought.<br>
The application described here is thus based on the object of making available DNA molecules which code for deacetylases. Using these deacetylases, it is possible to produce plants having plant parts which can be destroyed specifically. The production of male- or female-sterile plants is of particular interest. The object is achieved by the provision of the DNA and the enzyme of the present invention.<br>
The invention relates to DNA molecules which code for deacetylases or proteins with the biological activity of a deacetylase. The enzymatic properties of these proteins are described in the examples. The invention also relates to DNA molecules which encode a biologically active subfragment or a derivative. The molecules according to the invention also include fragments, derivatives or allelic variants. Fragments are understood as meaning parts which still have the biological activity of a deacetylase.<br><br>
The Invention additionally relates to transgenic plant cells which have been transformecSAising the DNA motecules^ according to the invention. The transgenic plant cells can be prepared according to known techniques and are regenerated to give whole plants.<br>
The invention relates to DNA molecules encoding a protein having the biological activity of an N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase.<br>
The invention relates in particular to DNA molecules encoding a protein having the biological activity of an N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase selected from the group consisting of<br>
a)	DNA molecules which code for a protein having the amino acid sequence Indicated under SEQ ID No 2 and fragments and/or derivatives thereof;<br>
b)	DNA molecules which code for a nucleotide sequence indicated under SEQ ID No 1 or sequences which deviate from this sequence within the bounds of code degeneracy;<br>
c)	DNA molecules which code for a protein having the amino acid sequence Indicated under SEQ ID No 4 or fragments and/or derivatives thereof and<br>
d)	DNA molecules which code for a nucleotide sequence indicated under SEQ ID No 3 or sequences which deviate from this sequence within the bounds of code degeneracy.<br>
The Invention additionally relates to the microorganisms Stenotrophomonas sp. (DSM 9734) and Comamonas acldovorans (DSM 11070) identified and deposited according to the method described In this application.<br>
The invention relates in particular to plant cells or plants which contain the DNA molecules according to the invention.<br><br>
Of particular interest are processes for the production of plants with specifically destroyable parts by means of specific expression of a deacetylase gene and processes for the production of male- or female-sterile plants by means of specific expression of a deacetylase gene.<br>
The present application thus also relates to:<br>
(1)	the specific concentration of microorganisms having high N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase activity<br>
(2)	the isolation of corresponding deacetylase genes<br>
(3)	the purification and characterization of the proteins having high N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase activity encoded by these genes<br>
(4)	the expression of the deacetylase genes in plants.<br>
The present application additionally relates to:<br>
the DNA molecules which code for enzymes having high N-acetyl-PPT<br>
deacetylase activity<br>
the proteins which are encoded by these genes<br>
the expression of these deacetylase genes in plants.<br>
From soil samples, bacteria can be concentrated in mineral medium with chitin as the sole carbon source which are able to cleave N-acetyl-PPT with high effectiveness. In this manner, 2 bacterial strains were Isolated as pure cultures: Stenotrophomonas sp. (DSM deposit No. DSM 9734) and Comamonas acidovorans (DSM deposit No. 11070).<br>
For the conditions necessary in industrial production, however, it is substantially more advantageous to be able to employ a purified enzyme.<br>
The present application comprises novel_L-N-Acetyl-PPT-specific deacetylases, a novel and effective process for the purification and characterization of this enzyme from a concentration culture of soil microorganisms, and the use of this deacetylase.<br><br>
The invention thus further relates to:<br>
1.       A deacetylase having<br>
-	a molecular weight of 20,000 to 100,000 Daltons<br>
-	a pH optimum of 6.5- lO.O<br>
-	a substrate specificity to L-N-acetyl-phosphinothricin.<br><br>
2.	A process for the preparation of a deacetylase, which comprises culturing a microorganism which does not form spores in a medium comprising crab chitin, and isolating the deacetylase from these microorganisms.<br>
3.	The use of the deacetylase characterized under 1. for the production of male-sterile plants and for the stereoselective preparation of L-phosphinothricin.<br>
The invention relates in particular to an enzyme which has a temperature optimum which lies between SCC and SCC.<br>
The process according to the invention for the preparation of the deacetylases is preferably carried out using microorganisms selected from the group which consists of the microorganisms described in the application.<br>
Crab chitin can be obtained as described by Shimahara, Kenzo and Takiguchi, Yasuyuki (Methods in Enzymology, Vol 161, pages 417-423, 1988) or is commercially available from Sigma.<br>
To purify the deacetylase, the microorganism is cultured in a nutrient medium cjptimal for its growth. The microorganism is cultured aerobically, for example submerse with shaking or stirring in shaker flasks or fermenters, if appropriate with introduction of air or oxygen. The fermentation can be carried out in a temperature range from approximately 20 to 40°C, preferably at approximately 25 to Z7°C, in particular at 30 to 37°C. Culture takes place in a pH range between 5 and 8.5,<br><br>
preferably between 5.5 and 8.0.<br>
Under these conditions, the microorganisms in general show a noticeable accumulation of the enzyme after 1 to 3 days. The synthesis of the deacetylase begins with the log phase. The production of the enzyme can be monitored with the aid of activity tests, by HPLC analysis or photometrically. The nutrient solution used for the production of the transaminase contains 0.2 to 5%, preferably 0.5 to 2%, of crab cWtin and inorganic salts.<br>
Inorganic salts vWiich the nutrient medium can contain are, for example, chlorides, carbonates, sulfates or phosphates of the alkali metal or alkaline earth metals, iron, zinc and manganese, but also ammonium salts and nitrates.<br>
According to the invention, effective amounts of the deacetylase can be employed in free or immobilized form for the deacetylation, preferably it is employed in plants which express deac genes.<br>
For fixation, the known processes are suitable, such as the processes desaibed in German Offenlegungsschriften 32 37 341 and 32 43 591.<br>
The enzyme can be isolated and purified by classical methods by means of decomposition by ultrasound and French press, ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchangers, affinity chromatography and gel permeation.<br>
The enzyme preparation can have a molecular weight of 20,000 to 100,000 Daltons, preferably 30,000 to 80,000, in particular 40,000 to 70,000 Daltons. The pH optimum of the enzyme product lies in the pH range 6.0 to 10.0, in particular 7.0 to 8.0. The temperature optimum of the enzyme lies between 30 and 50°C, in particular between 35 and 45'C.<br>
The genes coding for the deacetylases were cloned in E. coll. In the case of the dead gene from Stenotrophomonas sp., a phagemid expression bank from genomic DNA in E. coli was screened for N-acetyl-PPT-specific deacetylase activity. The<br><br>
deac2 gene from Comamonas acidovorans was cloned with a genomic bank by  ' complementation of an E. coli - argE mutant.<br>
The amino add sequences derived from the DNA sequences of the two genes are similar to one another and additionally have homology to hippurate hydrolases, as they are known from protein databanks.<br>
The high substrate affinity of the dead protein for N-acetyl-L-PPT {K^ = 670 pM) makes itself noticeable In the transgenic plants by a high sensitivity of the tissue to this substance. Thus In constitutive expression of the deac gene plants can be obtained whose leaves still react sensitively to concentrations of up to 0.4 mg/ml of N-acetyl-D,L-PPT (= 0.2 mg/ml of L-enantiomer). In the case of tapetum-specific expression, the induction of male-sterile flowers was achieved by treatment of the buds with 2 mg/ml of N-acetyl-D,L-PPT (= 1 mg/ml of L-enantiomer). The results described relate to greenhouse plants. On the basis of the low substance concentrations, If required, under open air conditions a higher dose of around 5 - 10-fold is possible without problems.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention more extensively. Percentage data. If not stated otherwise, relate to the weight The invention is defined further in the patent claims.<br>
Example 1: Isolation and identification of soil microorganisms having an N-acetyl-PPT-specific deacetylase activity<br>
Each 1 g of soil (sandy loam, Schwanheimer dune) was extracted for 1 h at room temperature with 10 mM NaCI,  10 mM Na phosphate buffer, pH = 7.0. To select various groups of microorganisms, the soil supernatants were transferred to the following liquid media:<br>
(1) MSI medium (for Eubacterja):	5 mM glucose<br>
5 mM succinate 10 mM glycerol<br><br>
1 g/l of NH4CI<br>
50 ml/I of solution A<br>
25 ml/1 of solution B<br>
Solution A:    50 g/l of K2HPO4 Solution B;    2.5 g/l of MgS04 0.5 g/l of NaCI 25 ml/I of trace elements<br>
(2)	Chitin medium (for Actino- and Streptomycetes, and chitinovorous bacteria):<br>
10 g/l of crab chitin 1 g/l of (NH4)2S04 0.5g/lofMgSO4 50 ml/I of solution A 1 m!/l of trace elements<br>
(3)	Antibiotic medium (for higher fungi): 20 g/l of malt extract<br>
10 g/l of glucose 2 g/i of yeast extract 0.5 g/l of {NH4)2S04 50 |jg/ml of tetracycline<br>
All media contained 5 mM N-acetyl-PPT and were incubated for 3 - 5 days at 28*'C after transferring.<br>
The concentration cultures were then tested for deacetylation of N-acetyl-PPT. To do this, the cells were centhfuged off at 10,000 rpm and the supernatants were investigated for formation of PPT in an amino acid analyzer (Biotronic LC 5001). Only the chitin medium cultures proved to be deacetylase-positive. After plating out on chitin-agar, a total of 40 individual colonies were isolated from these cultures, recultured in chitin liquid medium and tested again for deacetylase activity. Six positive isolates were found here, from which it was possible to obtain the active<br><br>
pure cultures by repeated streaking out on agar plates and further culturing of individual colonies. The strain with the highest deacetylase activity was identified as Stenotrophomonas sp. (DSM deposit No. DSM 9734).<br>
Example 2: Cloning and sequencing of the N-acetyl-PPT deactylase gene from Stenotrophomonas sp.<br>
The standard molecular biology methods used for the studies are described in Maniatis et al. 1982, Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.<br>
Genomic DNA from Stenotrophomonas sp. was prepared according to the method of Meade etal., 1982, J. Bacteriol. 149:114-122. After partial digestion with Sau3A, the 5 -10 kb size fraction was isolated and ligated in the lambda-ZAP express vector, which was cleaved with BamHI, from Stratagene (ZAP Express Vector Kit, Catalog No. 239201, Instruction Manual). Using the packaged ligation batch, a primary lambda-phage bank was prepared and then amplified. A phagemid expression bank in Escherichia coli was prepared from this with the aid of the pBK-CMV phagemid system from Stratagene (Catalog No. 212209, Instruction Manual). This gene bank was tested for the presence of the deacetylase gene by activity screening with [^^C]-N-acetyl-L-PPT as a substrate. For this purpose, 2000 individual clones were transferred to microtiter plates and cultured overnight in LB medium at SZ^C with 0.2 mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) as an inducer and 50 pg/ml of kanamycin as a resistance marker. The cells were centrifuged off and incubated overnight at 28'C in 10 pi each of 1 mM [^*C]-N-acetyl-L-PPT. The batches were then analyzed in pools of eight for conversion of N-acetyl-PPT into PPT by thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography (see EP 531 716, Example 8) and the individual clones retested in the case of a positive result. Using this method, it was possible to select from 1920 transformants a positive clone having a 6 kb insert. This DNA fragment was characterized in greater detail by restriction mapping. By subcloning restriction fragments of the inserts in pUC18/19 and transformation of the recombinant plasmids in E. coli, it was possible with the aid of the activity test described above to localize the deac structural gene on a 2.5 kb (2487 base pairs)<br><br>
Sall/Smal fragment (Fig. 1). The activity was dependent on the orientation of the fragment relative to the lac promoter of the vector.<br>
The 2.5 kb fragment was sequenced on both strands using the Sanger method (Sanger et al. 1977, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 74:5463-5468). The entire fragment has a length of 2487 nucleotides (see SEQ ID No. 1). The open reading frame of 1494 nucleotides length begins with nucleotide No. 367 and ends with No. 1860.<br>
Expression studies with PCR subfragments from this region in E. coli showed that the active deacetylase protein is encoded by a region 1365 nucleotides long beginning with the ATG start codon in position 496 and ending with the TGA stop codon in position 1860. The amino acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence is a polypeptide of 454 amino acids (SEQ ID No. 2) having a calculated molecular weight of 48.1 kDa.<br>
A homology search in the EMBL, DNA and protein databanks showed similarities to the N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase from Comamonas acidovorans described in this application for the first time (37.4% identical amino acids), the hippurate hydrolase from Campylobacter jejuni (33.9%) and N-acyl-L-amtdohydrolase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (33.7%). Below, the gene isolated from Stenotrophomonas is described as dead. The corresponding protein is described as Dead. On account of the homology, it can be assumed that the hippurate hydrolases and amidohydrolases mentioned can also advantageously be used in combination with tissue-specific promoters and a subsequent treatment for the preparation of plants having selectively destroyable tissues, in particular male and/or female-sterile plants.<br>
Example 3: Characterization of the Dead protein<br>
To overexpress and purify the deacetylase from Stenotrophomonas sp. (dead), the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene fusion vector system from Pharmacia (Catalog No. 27-4581-01, Catalog No. 27-4570-01) was used. The method is described in Smith and Johnson, 1988, Gene 67:31. The fusion proteins are purified<br><br>
by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B.<br>
The functional deac gene was redoned into the GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-2 under control of the lac promoter as a 1.4 kb BamHI/Sall PCR fragment. The expression of recombinant fusion protein was induced by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG. By SDS/polyacrylamide electrophoresis of crude extracts of the E. coll transformants, it was possible to detect the fusion protein as a 74 kDa band.<br>
To purify the protein, the cells of a 2 I culture of an induced, expression-positive E. coli transformant were disrupted with ultrasound and the extract was then solubilized by addition of 1% Triton X-100. The supernatant was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. After repeated washing with PBS buffer (140 mM NaCI, 3 mM KCI, 10 mM Na2HP04, 2 mM KH2PO4, pH = 7.3), the fusion protein bound to the Sepharose matrix was cleaved with thrombin. The eluate contained as the only protein band a cleavage product of 48 kDa (after denaturing SDS/polyacrylamide electrophoresis), which was identified in the enzyme assay (see below) as N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase. Using the method described, it was possible to purify 200 M9 of deacetylase protein to homogeneity from 2 I of bacterial culture.<br>
The activity of the deacetylase protein was measured using the two following assays:<br>
(1) Radioactive test: 2.5 ^ig each of purified enzyme were incubated with 0.1 mM [^*Cl-N-acetyl-L-PPTfor 15 min. at 37°C in 10 pi batches in PBS buffer. The samples were then diluted 1:6 in 5 mM KH2PO4,10% methanol, pH = 1,92 and analyzed in the HPLC using a radioactivity detector (separating column: Spherisorb SAX, eluent: 5 mM KH2PO4, 10% methanol, pH = 1.92, flow rate: 0.5ml/min). Under these conditions, [^*C1-L-PPT elutes at 4.5 min. and [^*C]-N-acetyl-L-PPT elutes at 6.5 min. The specific deacetylase activities were determined in [nmol of [^*C]-L-PPT/min/mg of protein]. To determine the pH optimum, the batches were incubated between pH = 6 and 9 in a buffer system of, in each case, 40 mM bis-tris, tris and caps. For the K^ value measurement, 3-fold determinations were carried out at pH = 8.0 in the presence of 1 mM C0CI2 using concentrations of [^^C]-N-<br><br>
acetyl-L-PPT of between 0.01 mM and 1 mM.<br>
(2) Nonradioactive test: To investigate the substrate specificity, 5 pg each of purified enzyme were incubated for 60 min. at 28'C in 20 pi batches in PBS buffer with, in each case, 25 mM of a certain N-acetyl- or N-acylamino acid. The samples were then measured in an amino add analyzer (Biotronic LC 5001) for formation of the free amino acids. The specific activities were determined in [nmol of amino acid/min/mg of protein]. For the N-acetyl-PPT deacetylase, a pH optimum of pH = 8 (see Tab. 1) and a temperature optimum of ST^C (see Tab. 2) were determined. The kinetic measurements showed a Kj^ value of 670 pM. By addition of 1 mM C0CI2, the enzyme activity could be increased by about 20%.<br>

The results of the measurements of substrate specificity are shown in Tab. 3.<br>
The enzyme has a relatively wide substrate spectrum. The highest conversions were achieved with hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine) and N-acetyl-L-glutamate. The affinity for N-acetyl-L-PPT lies approximately 50% below that for the two abovementioned substrates. The deacetylase has an exclusive specificity for N-acetyl-L-amino acids. Using the corresponding D-enantiomers, no reactions were observed.<br>

Example 4: Constitutive expression of the dead gene in tobacco<br>
The dead structural gene was recloned as a 1,4 kb BamHI/Sall PCT fragment into the binary vector pPCV801 (Koncz and Schell, 1986, Mol. Gen. Genet. 204: 383-396) under control of the 35S promoter. The resulting plasmld pPCVKDEACI (Fig. 2) with the expression vector 35S promoter-dead -structural gene-35S terminator was transformed in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain ATHV) using standard methods. Pieces of tobacco leaf (Nicotiana tabacum) were transformed with the recombinant Agrobacteria according to the method of Horsch et al., 1985, Science 227: 1229-1231 and selected on kanamycin medium, 18 independent tobacco transformants were regenerated and tested for expression of the deacetylase in the leaves. In the case of activity of the protein in the transgenic plants, a sensitivity of the leaves to N-acetyl-PPT was to be expected, because the substance in the plant is then converted into the herbiddal active compound phosphinothhcin on account of the enzymatic activity of the deacetylase.<br>
In a drop experiment, the leaves of the transgenic plants and of a number of nontransgenic control plants were treated with 5 pi each of the following concentrations of N-acetyl-D,UPPT: 4 mg/ml (= 15 mM), 1 mg/ml (= 3,75 mM), 0.4 mg/ml (= 1.5 mM), 0.1 mg/ml (= 0.38 mM). The treatment sites were examined for lightening or necrosis formation after 1-2 weeks. Simultaneously, the N-acetyl-PPT-specific deacetylase activity of the transformants, and also of the control plants, was measured in crude extracts. To do this, 100 mg each of leaf material were homogenized in 200 pi of PBS buffer, the cell debris was centrifuged off and<br><br>
the protein-containing supernatants vk^ere dialyzed overnight at 4X against the same buffer. 10 pi each of these samples were incubated with 0.1 mM [^*CJ-N-acetyl-L-PPT overnight at 37°C. The batches were then analyzed in the HPLC, as described above, for formation of [^^C]-L-PPT.<br>
The test results of the drop experiments and the activity tests are shown in Tab. 4 for selected plants. It is seen that about 60% of the transformants express the functional deacetylase protein and show the corresponding phenotype.<br>

Example 5: Tapetum-specific expression of the dead gene in tobacco<br>
Using standard methods, the tapetum-specific promoter of the tap1 gene from snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) was fused in the vector pUC18 as a 2.2 kb<br><br>
EcoRI/BamHI fragment with the dead structural gene (1.4 kb BamHI/Sall-PCR fragment) and the 35S terminator. The expression cassette tap1 promoter-deac structural gene-35S terminator thus resulting was cloned into the binary vector pPCV80l as a 3.8 kb EcoRI fragment instead of the 35S promoter/terminator region (plasmid pPCVTDEACI, Fig. 3), The transformation of tobacco was carried out as described in Example 4.<br>
In the case of tapetum-specific expression of the deacetylase, it should be possible by treatment of the flower buds with N-acetyl-PPT to induce male-sterile flowers. The conversion of the PPT derivative into the herbicidal active compound phosphinothricin leads to selective damage to the tapetum tissue, by means of which the development of functional pollen is prevented.<br>
In each case only one side of the inflorescences (the total area of the developing flower buds) was treated with N-acetyl-PPT, the other side of the inflorescences remained untreated in order to ensure that the phenomena to be observed are not to be attributed to defonnities of the respective plants. The treatment was carried out at a time at which the individual buds were not larger than 5 mm (active phase for tapetum promoter). The tobacco transformants and also a number of NT Sam NN control plants were treated 3x with 0.2% N-acetyl-D,L-PPT (= 7.5 mM)/0.1% Genapol (wetting agent) within one week. After the blooming of the buds (about 9 -11 days after conclusion of the treatment), the plants were investigated for the occurrence of male-sterile flowers.<br>
Simultaneously, the N-acetyl-PPT-specific deacetylase activity in immature anthers of the transformants, and also of the control plants, was measured. To do this, the immature anthers were dissected from flower buds about 5 mm in size and incubated overnight at room temperature in 50 pM [^*C]-N-acetyl-L-PPT solution in each case. The anthers were subsequently washed 1x in 500 |jl of PBS buffer and then homogenized in 50 pi of PBS buffer. After centhfuging off the cell debris, the supernatants were concentrated in a Speed-Vac and the pellets were taken up in 30 Ml each of HPLC buffer (5 mM KH2PO4, 10% methanol, pH = 1.92). The batches were analyzed for formation of [^*C]-L-PPT in the HPLC, as described above.<br><br>
The results of the flower treatment and of the activity test are shown for selected plants in Tab. 5. In almost all transformants, it was possible to determine an anther-specific deacetylase activity. In 3 transformants, male-sterile flowers, i.e. no pollen was formed, or severely pollen-reduced flowers were observed on the side of the flower cluster treated with N-acetyl-PPT. The effects on new, maturing buds lasted for a period of about 3 weeks. The untreated flowers of the transformants, and also the treated flowers of the control plants, were fertile in all cases. With the male-sterile flowers, no seed formation was determinable. A specific cross pollination of the male-sterile fkswers was possible, however, by means of which it was proven that the female flower parts have kept their full functionality (Nacken et al, 1991, Mol. Gen. Genet. 229: 129-136).<br>

Example 6: Isolation and identification of a deacetylase having specificity for N-acetylphosphinothricin from Comamonas acidovorans<br>
A soil sample from Bangkok was suspended in mineral salt medium (0.5 g of K2HPO4, 0.2 g of MgS04, 2 g of {NH4)2S04, 0.01 g of FeS04 in 980 ml of HjO), which contained chitin (2 g/l) as the only carbon source and subsequently incubated<br><br>
at 30°C for 48 hours. Transfer to fresh mineral salt medium then took place and after Incubation for a further 48 hours dilution series were plated out on LB medium (Miller. Experiments in molecular genetics, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press).<br>
Among the growing colonies, also found were those of a bacterial strain which distinguishes Itself In pure culture by a very good utilization of N-acetyl glutamate as the only carbon source (streak!ng-out on mineral salt medium with N-acetyl glutamate (2 g/l, add as a stehle-filtered solution to autoclaved mineral salt medium with 14 g/l of agar) leads In the course of incubation at SCC for 12 hours to the formation of clearly visible colonies). The deacetylation of N-acetyl-PPT was detected as described above. The strain provided with the laboratory description 86 was identified by the DSM as Comamonas acidovorans (DSM 11070).<br>
Example 7: Cloning of the deacetylase gene from Comamonas acidovorans<br>
Total DNAfrom Comamonas acidovorans was isolated, digested with EcoRI and ligated with likewise EcoRI-digested DMA of the vector pACYCI 84 (Gang and Cohen, 1978, J. Bacteriol. 134, 1141-1156). The ligation batch was used for the electroporation of the E. coli argE mutant XSID2 (Mountain et al., 1984, Mol. Gen. Genet. 197, 82-89). By selection for complementation of the arglnlne auxotrophy, It was possible to isolate an EcoRI fragment 8.9 kb in size from the genome of C. acidovorans, which is adequate for the complementation. By subcloning, the complementing region could be restricted to a fragment 1.4 kb in size. This is present In the derivative designated by pGK83 of the sequencing vector pSVB30 (Arnold and Puhler, 1988, Gene 70, 172-178).<br>
Example 8: Sequencing of the deacetylase gene from Comamonas acidovorans<br>
The complementing fragment 1.4 kb (1387 base pairs) in size was completely sequenced as a double strand by known methods.<br><br>
Example 9: Coding region analysis and homology comparison of the sequenced region<br>
A coding region analysis showed an open reading frame from position 1 to 1206 (SEQ ID No. 3), which codes for a protein 402 amino acids in size (SEQ ID No. 4).<br>
The homology comparison with known genes from databanks shows a clear homology to an N-acyl-L-amidohydrolase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (ama, Sakanyan et al., 1993, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 59, 3878-3888) and a hippurate hydrolase from Campylobacter jejuni {hitherto unpublished). In the protein comparison, the hippurate hydrolase has 43% of identical amino acids (Tab. 6). Moreover, at the DNA and protein level, the gene has a very conspicuous homology to the deacetylase gene isolated from Stenotrophomonas spec. Following the designation of the gene from Stenotrophomonas sp., the gene identified from C. acidovorans was designated by deac2.<br>
Table 6: Homology comparison with known sequences<br><br>
Gene	Organism	Function	ident. AA	cons. AA<br>
n.n	Campylobacter jejuni	Hippurate hydrolase (383 AS)	43.1 %	60.0%<br>
deac2	Bacillus stearothermophilus	N-acyl-L-amido-hydrolase (370 AS)	37.0%	49.5%<br>
Example 10: Overexpression of the deac2 gene from Comamonas acidovorans plant constructs<br>
To analyze the substrate specificity of the deac2 gene product from Comamonas acidovorans, this was overexpressed. To do this, the gene was cloned Into a vector with a high copy number under control of the lacZ promoter. The expression efficiency, however, was restricted by the simultaneous translation, taking place in another reading frame, of the lacZ-alpha, This was therefore interrupted by introducing a stop codon, such that the vector pGK81 makes possible an<br><br>
overexpression of the deac2 gene which is not adversely effected by the lacZ gene. It was also possible to detect this phenotypically, since this construct has a markedly higher complementation of an E. coll argE mutant.<br>
For the transformation of plants, the deac2 structural gene was recloned using the binary vector pROKI (Baulcombe et al. 1986, Nature, 321: 446-449) after the constitutive 35S promoter or the tapetum-specific promoter TA-29. The expression plasmids pGK83 and pMF9 obtained are shown in the figures.<br>
Example 11: Investigation of the substrate specificity of the deac2 gene product from Comamonas acidovorans<br>
To investigate the substrate specificity of the deac2 gene product from Comamonas acidovorans, cells of E. coli strain XLI blue permeabilized by toluene/ethanol treatment were used with and without the vector pGK81. The induction of the deac2 gene repressed by the Lac' repressor present in this strain could be achieved by IPTG treatment. The peimeabilized cells were incubated for 3 hours at 30°C with various N-acetylated amino acids {final concentration 25 mM) and the supernatants were investigated with the aid of an amino acid analyzer. It turned out here that more than 20% of the N-acetylornithine made available was converted. For N-acetylphosphinothricin too, an increasing deacetylation to phosphinothricin, analogous to the concentration of N-acetylphosphinothricin employed, could be found (Table 7).<br>
