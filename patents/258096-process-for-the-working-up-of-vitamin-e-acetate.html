				<td>Process for the rectification of miaetures of high-boiling air- and/or temperature-sensitive useful<br>
     products<br>
The invention relates to a process for the rectification of mixtures of high-boiling air- and/or temperature-sensitive substances, in particular the rectification of tocopherol acetate - also referred to as vitamin E acetate (VEA) - for separating lower-boiling and higher-boiling impurities from the useful product.<br>
The VEA obtained by desertification of vitamin E with acetic anhydride, also referred to below as crude VEA, can be freed from the substantial residues of acetic acid and acetic anhydride and other impurities, for example, by multistage distillation steps in falling-film evaporators, thin-film evaporators, etc. Usually, such a reaction mixture then contains about 94% by weight of VEA, 1 - 2% by weight of low-boiling substances (chiefly phytadienes}", about 2 - 3% by weight of unspecified isomers of the useful product (VEA) and 1-2% by weight of high-boiling secondary components.<br>
In the industrial purification of a VEA-containing product stream, for example, cascades of short-path evaporators are used. As complete as possible a separation of the low-boiling substances from' the product stream flowing to the cascade of short-path evaporators is decisive for the dimensioning<br><br>
and  the operation of  the  short-path evaporators  and the vacuum   system   at   the   required,    very   low   pressures.    A thin-film   evaporator   usually   operated   at   about   1 mbar and  intended  for  removing   the   low  boilers   is   therefore connected     upstream     of      the      cascade      of      short-path evaporators.    The   vapour   stream   produced   in    the   thin-film     evaporator     contains     substantially    phytadienes, vitamin    E    acetate    and    residues    of    acetic     acid    and acetic   anhydride   and   is   virtually   completely   condensed in   a   downstream   condenser    system.    Owing   to    the   high content   of   low boilers,   the   condensate   obtained   cannot be    further    used    and    is    discarded.    Because    of    the position   of   the   phase   equilibrium,    the   proportion   of VEA   in   this   vapour   stream   is   about   13%   by   weight   and the   loss   of  VEA  is   about   2.7%,   based  on   the   inflowing amount  of VEA.   A low boiler   fraction of,   usually,   about 2%    by   weight    remains    in    the    useful   product     (bottom product     of     the    thin-film     evaporator) .     The     bottom product    of    the    thin-film    evaporator    is    fed    to    the cascade   of   short-path   evaporators,    in which   the VEA is further       .enriched       by    repeated       evaporation       and condensation.<br>
The   process    described   above   and   intended    for obtaining-   VEA –has  the  following  disadvantages.     As already   mentioned,    a part   of   the   useful   product    (VEA) passes    out    of    the    thin-film    evaporator    via    the    gas phase  to  the downstream  condenser   system and  is  finally lost.    Furthermore,    only   parts    of   the   low   boilers   are separated off in the  thin-film evaporator,   which is per se   a   relatively   complicated   and   expensive   apparatus, and   the  rest  remains   in   the  useful  product   and  has   to be   separated   off   later   on   by   a   complicated  procedure. At  the  same time,   owing  to   the  incomplete  separation   of the main product from the byproducts in the respective purification steps, this process also includes recycled streams which have to be fed back to the process by a relatively complicated procedure.<br>
Since VEA is being used to an increasing extent for human nutrition or prophylaxis in healthcare, the purity of this product has to meet increasingly high requirements. The VEA quality required for these intended uses, also referred to below as "pharma grade" (PG) quality, is defined as follows:<br>
-	Purity &gt; 97.5% by weight<br>
-	Colourless to slightly greenish yellow<br>
VEA obtained from the process described above has a purity of  92% by weight, it fulfils the condition which is set for the so-called "technical grade" (TG) quality of the useful product but not the requirements of a PG quality. For use as a food additive or for medical applications, it must therefore be subjected to further purification steps.<br>
It is known that, in the working up of .product mixtures by distillation, the best results are generally obtained when so-called counter current -• distillation-- (also referred--- to -'as- rectification) "SI"" used, i.e. a special distillation process with countercurrent flow of descending reflux and ascending vapour in rectification columns. It is usual to use columns in which the mixture to be separated is introduced in the middle part of the column, the vapour becomes enriched with more readily volatile components on its way through the column from bottom to top and the reflux becomes enriched with more sparingly volatile components from top to bottom. The transport<br>
of material and heat is intensified by elements installed in the column, such as column trays, random packings or structured packings, which ensure a sufficient contact time of the phases and a sufficiently large phase boundary.<br>
It is furthermore known that, for the separation of high-boiling, temperature-sensitive mixtures of substances which require a high separation efficiency, which also includes the mixture present here (crude VE&amp;} , it is preferable to use rectification columns which have packings composed systematically in a regular geometry and having defined passage regions for countercurrent phases. This is the case in particular because, compared with random packings, regularly structured packings are distinguished by a higher load capacity and a better separation effect, have a smaller specific pressure drop and reguire a smaller volume of packings and therefore also permit a smaller mass and heat transfer height.. Structured packings are therefore used in all vacuum rectifications, in which, owing to the temperature sensitivity of the mixture to be separated, a limitation of the column pressure drop is particularly<br>
-important--. --.Column packings, known for..- this	intended, .use<br>
are metal fabric packings of the BX and CY type from Sulzer, expanded .metal packings of the Optiflow or Mellapak type and Rhombopak type from Sulzer and Kuhni, respectively,  and similarly effective metal  fabric packings from other companies, such as Montz GmbH.<br>
The rectification of a VEA-containing mixture is disclosed, for example, in WO 97/02-880. However, the rectification generally advantageous for the purification of products on an industrial scale<br>
presents major problems in this case owing to the high boiling point of VEA and its decomposability at higher temperatures. Substantially distillation under high vacuum or even molecular distillations are therefore carried out in order to be able to distil VEA at as low temperatures as possible.<br>
In   spite    of    the    use    of    the   high   vacuum,     in<br>
general   only   purities    of    97.3%     (DE-A 27  43   920),     9B%<br>
(DE-A 42   08  477	and	JP-B-58   Oil   869),	98.5%<br>
(US-A 3 459  773)     or    98.5    to    99%     (DE-A 21   60   103)     are<br>
achieved according  to  the  prior art.   Purities   above  99%<br>
were   achieved   only   by   molecular   distillation,    namely<br>
purities   of   99.3%   according   to   JP-A 51/14671   and   99.5%<br>
according    to    JP-A-62 7226976,     it    being    necessary    to<br>
point   out   that,    on   investigation   by   the   more   precise<br>
methods   of    analysis    used    today   and   with    the   use    of<br>
purer   comparative    substances,    presumably   lower   purity<br>
values would be  achieved.   In  addition,   the  distillation<br>
yields   achievable   in   this  manner  are  in   each   case  very<br>
low,     and    both     the     capital     costs     and     the     ongoing<br>
operating   costs   of   such plants   are   therefore   very  high<br>
•owing to the extreme  complexity.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a process___for._ the ^ rectification,, ,o.f., .mixtures of .high boiling air- and/or temperature-sensitive useful products, but in particular a process for working up a VEA-containing product stream, which process does not have the above-mentioned disadvantages and which permits an economical method, which is simple in terms of process engineering, for separating off the useful product in high purity and high yield. In addition, the process should also permit the use of separation apparatuses which are simple in terms of process<br>
engineering and should make it possible to prepare two end products in different and optionally variable proportions, which end products differ in their purity. It is also considered advantageous to develop a process without recycling for treatment of the products under milder conditions.<br>
This object is achieved by a process having the features of Patent Claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention form the subject of the dependent Claims.<br>
Claim  1  proposes   a   process   for   the rectification of mixtures of high-boiling air- and/or • temperature-sensitive  substances  which, require  high     ^ separation efficiency,  in particular a process for working up, a VE- or VEA-containing. product stream, which is characterized in that, in a first purification stage,  low-boiling products  are separated  from the product  stream  virtually  without  loss  of  useful product, and unspecified isomers of the useful product are taken off,  and that,  in a second purification stage, the useful product is removed in one stream with a purity of &gt; 97% by weight and in a further stream with a purity of &gt; 92-% by weight.<br>
According to the invention a  completely novel  concept  for  the purification  of high-boiling  air-<br>
and/or temperature-sensitive .substances, for example VEA, was developed. Only pure waste streams (low boilers,, i.e. streams of low-boiling substances/streams comprising unspecified isomers of the useful product/streams of high-boiling byproducts, in each case having a very low VEA content) and pure product streams form. Thus, no streams which require further working-up are produced, which also permits the elimination of disadvantageous recycling.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the process serves for working up VEA, in which the loss of the useful product in the first purification stage is less than 5%, based on the amount of VEA in the feed which is added to the purification stage per unit time. In this particular case, the first purification stage may comprise a rectification column, from the top of which the low-boiling products and the unspecified isomers of VEA are taken off, a stream containing the 'useful product in purified form being taken off at the side and/or at the bottom of the column.<br>
The side take-off or the bottom take-off of the first rectification column can then be fed, in the second purification stage, to a second rectification column, from which VEA is then removed either<br>
as a bottom take-off having a purity of &gt; 97% by weight and as a top take-off having a purity of &gt; 32% by weight, or<br>
as a side take-off having a purity of &gt; 97'% by weight and as a mixture consisting of top take-off and distillate of the bottom take-off having a purity of &gt; 92% by weight.<br>
According to the invention the two  rectification columns have structured pickings having a ratio of separation efficiency to pressure drop of, preferably, &gt; 15 theoretical plates per mbar of pressure drop (basis: F factor = 1 Pa0'5, column diameter 1 metre, test mixture cis-/trans-decalin) . A particularly suitable structured packing is the OPTIFLOW packing from Sulzer AG. According to the invention, at least the side take-off is effected at the second column by partial condensation in a manner<br><br>
such, that the product to be separated off leaves the column as condensate and not as a product stream in vapour form. For this purpose, the columns .incorporate important design details which are important for the condensation process.<br>
The     advantages      of     the     preferred     processes according to the  invention are  the following:<br>
A    sharp    separation    in    one    column    is     achieved.<br>
Usually,    a   plurality   of    columns    is    required    for<br>
this purpose.<br>
In    particular     the     first     column     has     a     high<br>
separation   efficiency   in   combination  with   a   small<br>
pressure drop.<br>
The losses  of products  are very small..<br>
The   purity   of    the   pharma   grade   product    is    very<br>
high,   with a VEA content  of &gt; 97% by weight.<br>
The   process   is   very   flexible   with   regard   to   the<br>
amounts    of   product    to   be   produced   in    PG    or   TG<br>
quality.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, before crude VEA is fed to the first column, the product stream is passed for degassing into a falling-film evaporator in which in particular the low-<br>
 boiling substances,  such as for example solvent, residues, and any remaining traces of acetic acid and acetic anhydride are removed. The falling-film evaporator can also be designed thereby in such a way that it also serves for reducing the total chlorine content in the crude VEA, in order thereby to avoid any disadvantageous corrosion in the following stages. In the first column, the remaining low-boiling substances and the unspecified isomers of the useful product are then separated off at the top, and the VEA is removed<br><br>
10<br>
as a side take-off in vapour form with a content of &gt; 96%. For the preparation of the "pharma grade" • quality, the side take-off stream of the first column is rectified again in the second column. According to the invention, the "pharma grade" quality is taken off as a side take-off. The bottom product from the first column is squeezed out in a short-path evaporator and gives the VEA-TG as a distillate together with the top product of the second column.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to the drawing.<br>
In the drawing,<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the process<br>
according to the invention, designed for<br>
working up VEA,	~""':<br>
.Figure 2  shows an alternative method of carrying out<br>
' the process according to Figure 1 and<br>
Figure .3  shows  a  side  take-off point  as  provided according to the invention in the second and, if required, first rectification column. The procedure  shown  in  Figure  1  for  the preparation of VEA has the following organization. The crude VEA originating from the acetylation stage 5 ^c;onvjer..sion,,Q.f vitamin., E., intp...yEA.f.. including, separating".** off  the  main portion  of  acetic  acid  and  acetic anhydride)  is fed to the degasser 3  (falling-film evaporator) .   There,   the   remaining   low-boiling components, such as, for example, acetic .acid or acetic anhydride, are removed via the line 2. The degassed crude VEA obtained at the bottom of the degasser 3 is added as feed approximately in the middle of  the rectification column 1. At the top la of the column 1, lower-boiling components and unspecified iso'mers of the<br><br>
seful product are removed via the line 9 virtually without loss of useful product. The bottom take-off obtained at the bottom Ib of the column 1 is fed via the line 11 to the short-path evaporator 13. The loss of the useful product VEA via the top take-off of the first rectification column 1 is 
The column 1 furthermore has a side take-off 15 which is present' below the column feed. The side takeoff of the column 1 is connected via the line 17 to a second rectification column 19, here too the feed being arranged approximately in the middle-of the column. The bottom take-off formed at the bottom 19b of the column 19 is fed to the. short-path evaporator 13 via the. line 23 together with the bottom take-off of the column 1 via the line 11. In the short-path distillation, a residue stream 4 and a distillate" stream 25 are obtained.. -The distillate stream 25 is mixed with the top take-off obtained at the top 19a of the column 15.<br>
According to the invention, the column 19 also has a side take-off 27, as described in more detail below. Furthermore, both columns 1 and 19 each have a rcbndeiiser----arra3igred~inv the—top. ..la.. - and-.,.19^,*,v^cespec tiyely, and an evaporator provided in the bottom Ib and 19b, respectively. These components which as such are conventional and customary for rectification columns are generally known to a person skilled in the art and are therefore neither described in detail nor shown in the drawing. According to the invention, the two rectification columns are packed with structured packings, the ratio of separation efficiency to pressure drop of which is greater than 15 theoretical<br><br>
plates per mbar pressure drop (basis: F factor = 1 Pa0'5, column diameter 1 metre, test mixture cis-/trans-decalin) . The principle of the process according to Figure 1 is distinguished by the fact that the remaining traces of low-boiling components, such as, for example, acetic acid, acetic anhydride or solvent residues from the product stream arriving from the acetylation, are removed from the crude VEA in the upstream degasser 3 and are transported away via the line 2.<br>
In the first column 1, the remaining lower-boiling components and also the unspecified isomers of the useful product are then separated off at the top la, and a VEA having a content of &gt; 96% by weight is removed at the side take-off point 15 by partial condensation.<br>
According to the invention, the column 1 is operated as follows:<br>
The side take-off comprises about 75% by weight, based on the feed stream added, this having as high a VEA content as possible with a small amount of unspecified isomers of the useful product and high-boiling components.<br>
_-rt	The... tflD.. .takeLT.pffi^comprises,—^absut-~^2..-iko 5%<br>
weight, based on the feed stream.<br>
The  top  condenser  arranged  in  the  top  105a<br>
virtually completely condenses the incoming vapour<br>
stream to give reflux and top take-off.<br>
The  pressure  at  the  top  of  the  column  is<br>
preferably about 0.5 to 1 mbar and is as far as<br>
possible   kept   constant,   and   the   column<br>
temperatures are between 190 and 280°C, depending<br>
on the loading of the column.<br><br>
On maintaining these guide parameters, and depending on the established reflux ratio of column 1, the latter can be operated so that the VEA content in the side take-off is well above 95% by weight and that in the top take-off is substantially below 20% by weight.<br>
The side take-off of the first column 1 is fed via the line .17 to the second column 19 in order to prepare VEA-PG. The take-off of this quality is in turn effected as a side take-off by partial condensation at position 27 and is removed from the plant via product line 29.<br>
The bottom product emerging from the bottom Ib of the first column 1 is squeezed out together with the bottom product -of the second column 19 in the short-<br>
i •  -'     .<br>
path evaporator 13 and gives a distillate which, together with the product of the second column 19, emerging from the top 19a of the second column 19, forms the VEA-TG.<br>
In the alternative method of carrying out the process for the preparation or purification of the VEA products, shown in Figure 2, there is no side take-off from the first column 1. Instead, the bottom product of •'the column'-'l--is-"fcran-spO'Eted ^via the. product, stream,,line., 11 directly and completely to the second column 19. As a result of this, the feed to the short-path evaporator consists only of the bottom take-off of the column 19, and in this case' the VEA-TG is formed only from the mixture of the top product and the distillate of the bottom product of the second column 19.<br>
The side take-off by partial condensation in the columns 19 and/or 1 is decisive for carrying out the preferred process according to the invention. This<br><br>
side take-off will therefore be explained in more detail before the purification of VEA is described in more detail with reference to two specific examples.<br>
In the section of the two rectification columns 1 and 19 according to the invention, shown in Figure 3 , the countercurrent flow is characterized by the descending reflux stream 31 and ascending vapour stream 33 in the rectification column, in the region of the side take-off point the vapour flowing through the packings -and separating elements of the side take-off from bottom to top, and the reflux flowing inside a guide pipe from top to bottom.<br>
A distributor 35 which redistributes the reflux from the collector bed 37 above the side take-off is present in the lower region of the side take-off ""point. In order to avoid contamination of the (vapour) side take-off with liquid, a half layer of Mellapak 250X is installed as a splash guard 39. Directly above this layer 39, the collector 41 for the side take-off is provided. The collector 41 empties, for example-, into a trap 43 which opens into an outlet 45 intended for removal of the . vapour condensate to be separated off. Above the collector 41 there follows a side take-off _ gartialL^cpndens.er 47J_whicJi,,.,..Tf._oa: example,, -is. in,.the-Kfenn of a D-tube bundle heat exchanger and serves for producing the vapour condensate. A total take-off collector 37, which transports the reflux - as already mentioned - from the upper part of the side take-off point past the partial condenser 47 into the lower distributor 35 is preferably present as the uppermost element. It is advantageous that the collector 37 carries out a total take-off so that the side take-off is not contaminated by the reflux or adversely affects<br><br>
the -colour of the side take-off.<br>
According to the invention, the side take-off is effected, by partial condensation of the vapour phase ascending in the column. This has the advantage that a vapour condensate, i.e. not a product stream in vapour form, is taken off as a side take-off, with the result that the pressure drop caused by- the take-off and owing to the smaller volume streams of the liquids can be significantly reduced. Since the take-off involves a partial condensation, an additional purification stage is furthermore obtained, which also proves to be parti cularly advantageous.<br>
It should be pointed out here that the process described with reference to Figures 1 and 2 represents only one working example of the invention and that in particular the design of the plant which serves for carrying out the process can vary in different respects within the scope of protection defined by Claim 1. Thus, the process according to the invention and the partial side take-off can also be used for the purification of vitamin E (VE) and of course also for the working-up or purification of other substances which, like VE and VEA, are high-boiling and ~temp£:raCi2r-e~sensitive -and are usually, purified by means<br>
;	.-•.• — - 	<br>
of rectification columns.<br>
The processes described above with reference to Figures 1 and 2 will now be described in detail by means of two specific examples.<br>
Example 1   (with reference to Figure 1)<br>
Synthetically prepared crude VEA having a content of about 90 to 92% of VEA, about 2-3% of low-<br><br>
boiling components (chiefly phytadienes), about 2-3% of unspecified isomers of the useful product (VEA) and about 3-4% of high-boiling components is degassed in a falling-film evaporator at 185°C and about 3 mbar. The degassed crude VEA is fed in at a temperature of between 180 and 250°C approximately in the middle of the rectification column 1 with a packing height of 6 to B m of the Sulzer Optiflow C36 type. The pressure at the top of the column is about 0.5 to 1 mbar. At the top of the column 1, about 4% by mass of the feed stream is removed as a top take-off with a content of about 3% of VEA. The column 1 is operated at a reflux ratio of about 10 to 20. The side take-off point is about 2 to 3 m of packing height below the feed inflow point. About 75% of the feed stream having a VEA content of about 96-97% are removed at the side takeoff. The desired flow rate is set by regulation of the partial condenser forward flow temperature. The product obtained at the bottom of the column 1 at a temperature of 260 to 270°C still contains about 80-82% of VEA.<br>
The side take-off of the column 1 having a VEA content of about 96 to 97% is then added at a-temperature between 180 and 250°C as feed approximately in. the ..middle, _ of the rectication column.19 having. a packing height of 6 to 8 m of the Sulzer Optiflow C36 type. The pressure at the top of the column. 19 is about 0.5 to 1 mbar. At the top of the column 19, about 5 to 15% by mass of the feed stream are removed as a top take-off having a content of about 92 to 95% of VEA. The column 19 is operated at a reflux ratio of about 15 to 30. The side take-off point is about 2 to 3 m of packing height'below the feed inflow point. At the side take-off, depending on the desired amount of PG,<br><br>
between 50 and 78% (the latter corresponds to 60% of the VEA used in the form of PG) of the feed stream with a VEA content of more than 97% are removed. The desired flow rate is established by regulation of the partial condenser forward flow temperature. The product obtained at the bottom of the column 19 at a temperature of 260 to 270°C still contains about 90-95% of VEA, depending on the split ratio set.<br>
The bottom products of the columns 1 and 19 are<br>
now fed to the short-path evaporator 13, which is<br>
operated at a pressure of about 0.1 to 0.2 mbar. The<br>
residue still contains about 2-5% of VEA, while the VSA<br>
content in the distillate is about 92%. The distillate<br>
is mixed together with the top take-off of the column<br>
19 to give VEA TG,	.	<br>
Exaittple 2 (with reference to Figure 2)<br>
Synthetically prepared crude VEA having a content of about 90 to 92% of VEA, about 2-3% of. low-boiling components (chiefly phytadienes), about 2-3% of unspecified isomers of the useful product (VEA) and about 3-4% of high-boiling components is degassed in a falling-film- • evaporator.-:-at. 185DC -and.,.about 3 .mbar.....The degassed crude VEA is fed in at a temperature of between 180 and 25D°C approximately in the middle of the rectification column 1 with a packing height of 6 to 8 m of the Sulzer Optiflow C36 type. The pressure at , the top of the column is about 0.5 to 1 mbar. At the top of the column 1, about 4% by mass of the feed stream is removed as a top take-off with a content of about 3% of VEA. The column 1 is operated .at a reflux ratio of about 10 to 20. The product obtained at the<br><br>
bottom of the column 1 at a temperature of 260 to 270°C contains about 93-95% of VEA.<br>
The bottom take-off of the column 1 having a VEA content of about 93 to 95% is then added at a temperature between 180 and 250°C as feed approximately in the middle of the rectification column 19 having a packing height of 6 to 8 m of the Sulzer Optiflow C36 type. The pressure at the top of the column 19 is about 0.5 to 1 mbar. At the top of the column 19, about 5 to 15% by mass of the feed stream are removed as a top take-off having a content of about 92 to 95% of VEA.-. The column 19 is operated at a reflux ratio of about 15 to 30. The side take-off point is about 2 to 3 m of packing height below the feed inflow point. At the side take-off, depending on the desired amount of PG, between 40 and 60% (the latter corresponds to 60% of the VEA used in the form of PG) of the feed stream with a VEA content of more than 97% are removed. The desired flow rate is established by regulation of the partial condenser forward flow temperature. The product obtained at the bottom of the column 19 at a temperature of 260 to 270°C still contains about 82-87% of VEA, depending on the split ratio set.<br>
The bottom product of the columns 19 is now fed<br>
to the short-path evaporator 13, which is operated at a pressure of about 0.1 to 0.2 mbar. The residue still contains about 2-5% of VEA, while the VEA content in the distillate is about 92 to 95%, depending on the split. The distillate is mixed together with the top take-off of the column 19 to give VEA TG.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
