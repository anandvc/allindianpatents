BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a wiring structure and a wiring method for a motorcycle to electrically connect an electric part supported on a handle cover of the motorcycle, such as meters and switches, with a conductor installed in the handle cover.<br>
2.	Description of  the  Related Art<br>
Wiring for electric parts such as meters and switches provided on a handle cover covering the bar handle of a motorcycle has been accomplished via wiring harness (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 60-244680, for example).<br>
In the above conventional wiring, because connectors provided at the ends of a wiring harness need to be connected to electric parts such as meters and switches on the inner side of the handle cover after the electric parts are attached to the handle cover, there has been a problem that the connection and disconnection work of the connectors is troublesome and assembly manhours increase. In addition, since the front and rear handle covers cannot be joined until after the wiring work is completed, a possibility of deteriorated work efficiency has been raised. Another drawback is that the wiring harness easily tangles and coils during<br><br>
wiring, degrading the assembly work efficiency and giving rise to a possibility that short-circuits, wire breaks and erroneous connections may occur.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished under these circumstances and it is a first object of this invention to facilitate and make reliable the wiring work on the meters supported on the handle cover.<br>
It is a second object of this invention to facilitate and make reliable the assembly work of switches into the handle cover and the wiring of the switches.<br>
It is a third object of this invention to facilitate and make reliable the wiring work of electric parts supported on the handle cover without using a wiring harness.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a wiring arrangement for a motorcyle to electrically connect a meter supported on a handle cover of the motorcycle to conductors located inside the handle cover, the wiring arrangement comprising a handle cover side connector connected to the conductors, a meter support hole formed in the handle cover, and a meter side connector provided in the meter, wherein the meter side connector is connected to the handle cover side connector by inserting the meter into the meter support hole.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also provides a wiring method for a motorcycle to supply electricity to an electric part supported on a handle cover of the motocycle, comprising: a step of injection-molding a busbar embedding substrate of a synthetic resin having a plurality of busbars made of a metal plate or a metal bar embedded therein; a step of injection-molding a handle cover made of a synthetic resin to enclose at least a part of the busbar embedding substrate; and a step of mounting the electrically part on the handle cover and electrically connecting the electric part to the busbars.<br>
With the above construction, simply inserting the	<br><br>
meter into the meter support hole formed in the handle cover results in the connection between the meter side connector of the meter and the handle cover side connector inside the meter support hole, so that the wiring between the conductors arranged inside the handle cover and the meter can be completed easily and reliably.<br>
To achieve the second objective, a second feature of this invention provides a wiring structure for a motorcycle to electrically connect a switch supported on a handle cover of the motorcycle to conductors arranged inside the handle cover, wherein the conductor is comprised of busbars made of a metal plate or a metal bar embedded in a busbar embedding substrate of a synthetic resin, tip ends of the busbars are projected from the busbar embedding substrate toward an opening formed in the handle cover to form busbar side connector terminals, and switch side connector terminals provided inside the switch are inserted into the opening to connect the busbar side connector terminals and the switch side connector terminals.<br>
With this construction, simply inserting the switch side connector terminals provided to the switch from the opening of the handle cover causes the switch side connector terminals to be connected to the busbar side connector terminals projecting from the busbar embedding  substrate,  automatically  completing  the<br><br>
wiring for the switch. Further, because the above-mentioned wiring work can be performed from outside the handle cover, the handle cover can be assembled beforehand, thus enhancing the work efficiency. Because the conductors connected to the switch are formed of a metal plate or a metal bar embedded in a synthetic resin, not only can the number of parts and manhours required for wiring be reduced but the possibility of short-circuit, wire break and erroneous assembly can also be reduced, compared with a case where the conventional wiring harness is used. Durability for long-term use is also improved over what is obtained by the wiring harness. Further, since the front ends of the busbars are projected from the busbar embedding substrate to form busbar side connector terminals, it is possible to reduce the parts count of the connectors and also the frequency of incidents of poor contacts and wire breaks, thus enhancing the reliability. Furthermore, because the switch side connector terminals are provided inside the switches, their deformations and damages can be prevented, thereby improving the electric contact reliability.<br>
To achieve the third objective, a third feature of this invention provides a wiring method for a motorcycle to supply electricity to an electric part supported on a handle cover of the motorcycle, which wiring method comprises: a step of injection-molding a<br><br>
busbar embedding substrate of a synthetic resin having a plurality of busbars made of a metal plate or a metal bar embedded therein; a step of injection-molding a handle cover made of a synthetic resin to enclose at least a part of the busbar embedding substrate: and a step of mounting the electric part on the handle cover and electrically connecting the electric part to the busbars.<br>
With the above method, the use of the busbar embedding substrate having the busbars embedded therein can reduce the number of parts and manhours required for wiring, compared with a case where the wiring harness is used- In addition, this wiring method can reduce the possibility of short-circuits, wire breaks and erroneous assembly and therefore can offer a better long-term durability than the method that the wiring harness is used.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of this invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETATLED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The first embodiment of this invention will be described by referring to Figs.l to 13.       <br><br>
Fig. 1 is a rear view of a scooter type motorcycle, which has the rear part of a bar handle covered with a rear handle cover 1 of synthetic resin, from both end of which project a left grip 2 and a right grip 3.<br>
Fig.2 is an enlarged view of the outer side of the rear handle cover 1 (the side that can be seen from a rider), at the center of which is provided a meter unit 5 covered with a transparent meter cover 4. The meter unit 5 includes a speed meter 6, a fuel meter 7, an odometer 8, a speed warning lamp 9, a turn pilot lamp 10, and an oil warning lamp 11. The rear handle cover 1 has a starter switch Ss at the right end thereof and a dimmer switch Sd, a winker switch Sw and a horn switch Sh at the left end thereof. The meter unit 5, starter switch Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh all constitute the electric parts of this invention.<br>
Fig.3 shows the rear handle cover 1 of Fig.2 as seen from the back of the drawing. The inner side of the rear handle cover 1 is normally covered with a front cover which is not shown so that it cannot be seen from outside. On the inner side of the rear handle cover 1 are laterally arranged a busbar embedding substrate 21 in place of the conventional wiring harness. The meter unit 5, starter switch Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh are connected to a battery and electric parts provided<br><br>
on the vehicle body side of the motorcycle V through busbars 22 ... embedded in the busbar embedding substrate 21.<br>
Fig.7 shows a busbar embedding substrate 21 alone, made by the injection molding of a synthetic resin, in which a number of conductive busbars 22 ..., punched from a metal plate, are embedded. The busbar embedding substrate 21 has ten openings 21i-21i(,, from which a part of the busbars 22 ... is exposed. Because each of the busbars 22 ... is formed of a fine and thin metal strip, it is difficult to embed these busbars 22 with positioning in an orderly manner in the busbar embedding substrate 21 when injection-molding the basbar embedding substrate 21. Hence, a plurality of busbars 22 ... are integrally connected by connecting portions 23 ... at areas corresponding to the openings 21i, 2I2 of the busbar embedding substrate 21(see shaded portions in Fig.SA).<br>
Interconnecting the plurality of busbars 22 ... by the connecting portions 23 ... can prevent the busbars 22 ... as an assembly set from coming apart, thus facilitating its manufacture and handling. Further, when setting the busbars 22 ... as an assembly set in the molding die for the injection molding of the busbar embedding substrate 21, the portions of the busbars 22 ... that are integrally connected together through the connecting portions 23 . . . are held to face the openings 21i, 21 in the<br><br>
busbar embedding substrate 21 so that the positioning of the busbars 22 ... can be facilitated and made reliable.<br>
After the busbar embedding substrate 21 is injection-molded, the connecting portions 23 ... of the busbars 22 ... facing the openings 21, 21 are cut and removed to electrically isolate the individual busbars 22 ... from each other, as shown in Fig.SB. Because the connecting portions 23 ... of the busbars 22 ... can be cut and removed by using the openings 21i, 2I2. special openings need not be formed. While in the above description two 21i, 2I2 of the ten openings 2I1-2I10 in the busbar embedding substrate 21 are taken as an example, the same applies to the remaining eight openings 2I3-2I10.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 7, the busbar embedding substrate 21 has integrally formed therewith at the central part a male connector 24 which is connected to a battery and electric parts provided on the vehicle body side of the motorcycle V, and a male connector 25 connected to the meter unit 5. The busbar embedding substrate 21 has formed at one end thereof an opening 26 in which the starter switch Ss is installed, and also has formed at the other end thereof three openings 27, 28, 29 in which the dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh are installed. These openings 26-29 are integrally provided with male connectors 30-33 respectively.  The rear handle cover<br><br>
1 is provided with four openings 34-37 that correspond to the openings 26-29 formed in the busbar embedding substrate 21 (see Fig.2).<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the male connector 24 to be connected to the battery and electric parts, the male connector 25 to be connected to the meter unit 5, and the male connectors 30-33 to be connected to the four switches Ss, Sd, Sw, Sh are interconnected by the plurality of busbars 22 ....<br>
When injection-molding the rear handle cover 1 with a synthetic resin, the busbar embedding substrate 21 is set in a molding die so that it is formed integral with the rear handle cover 1. That is, a collar 2111 protruding from the outer peripheral part of the busbar embedding substrate 21 (see Fig.7) is embedded in a lap portion lio of the rear handle cover 1 so that the busbar embedding substrate 21 can be supported on the rear handle cover 1 (see Fig.5). Fig.3 shows the busbar embedding substrate 21 formed integral with the rear handle cover 1. As shown in the figure, the busbar embedding substrate 21 is supported on the rear handle cover 1 by seven bridge portions I1-I7 that are part of the rear handle cover 1. As apparent from Fig.3 and Fig.7 combined, the bridge portion 1 is formed to cover two openings 21, 2I2 in the busbar embedding substrate 21; the bridge portion I2 is formed to cover an opening 2I3; the bridge portion I3 is formed to cover an opening 21;<br><br>
the bridge portion 1 is formed to cover two openings 21s, 21s; "the bridge portion I5 is formed to cover two openings 21, 219; the bridge portion I5 is formed to cover an opening 21,; and the bridge portion 1 is formed to cover an opening 21io.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the bridge portion 1, one of the seven bridge portions I1-I7, in a cross section. In the bridge portion I4 is situated the opening 2I5 of the busbar embedding substrate 21, which is embedded by the synthetic resin that forms the rear handle cover 1. Hence, the eight busbars 22 ... exposed in the opening 2I5 are completely covered with the synthetic resin and thus insulated from one another.<br>
Because in this construction the busbar embedding substrate 21 embedding the plurality of busbars 22 ... is molded of synthetic resin and, during the process of molding the rear handle cover 1, is formed integral with the rear handle cover 1 by seven bridge portions I1-I7, there are the following advantages.<br>
First, by forming separate from the rear handle cover 1 the busbar embedding substrate 21 which is relatively complex in structure because of the embedded busbars 22 . . . , the molding die for the busbar embedding substrate 21 and the molding die for the rear handle cover 1 can be simplified in construction.<br>
Second, because the busbar embedding substrate 21 is formed separately from the rear handle cover 1, the<br><br>
thickness of the rear handle cover 1 can be made uniform without being affected by the thickness of the busbar embedding substrate 21, molding sinks can be prevented, thereby enhancing the appearance of the rear handle cover 1.<br>
Third, because the busbar embedding substrate 21 is formed integral with the rear handle cover 1 by embedding the busbar embedding substrate 21 in the plurality of bridge portions I1-I7, the busbar embedding substrate 21 and the rear handle cover 1 reinforce with each other to increase the overall rigidity.<br>
Fourth, because a synthetic resin is automatically filled into the openings 2I1-2I10 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 when embedding the busbar embedding substrate 21 in the bridge portions l-l, no special filling process is required, thereby reducing manhours.<br>
Next, the process of mounting the meter unit 5 onto the rear handle cover 1 will be explained by referring to Figs.3 to 5.<br>
The meter unit 5 has a container-shaped housing 41 that supports the speed meter 6, fuel meter 7, odometer 8, speed warning lamp 9, turn pilot lamp 10 and oil warning lamp 11. A meter panel 42 is held between the opening of the housing 41 and the meter cover 4. A plurality of engagement claws 41 ... are formed on the outer periphery of the housing 41, and<br><br>
engaging the engagement claws 41 ... into claw receiving portions 4 ... formed in the meter cover 4 causes the housing 41 and the meter cover 4 to be joined together (see Fig.4).<br>
The meter unit 5 is inserted from above into a meter unit support hole 43 recessed at the central part of the rear handle cover 1. At this time, as shown in Fig.4, an engagement claw 4I2 formed on the rear side (rider side) of the housing 41 engages a claw receiving portion Ig which is formed so that it may face the meter unit support hole 43. Also as shown in Figs. 3 and 5, two lateral engagement claws 4I3, 4I3 formed on the front side of the housing 41 engage two claw receiving portions 1,, I9, with the result that the meter unit 5 is fixed to the rear handle cover 1.<br>
As shown in Figs.3 and 5, when the meter unit 5 is inserted into the meter unit support hole 43, a female connector 44 provided in the meter unit 5 is automatically coupled to the male connector 25 formed integral with the busbar embedding substrate 21. The male connector 25 on the busbar embedding substrate 21 side has a groove-shaped recess 25 opening upwardly and a plurality of male terminals 20 ... integrally extending from the busbars 22 ... and projecting into the recess ZS. The male connector 25 constitutes a handle cover side connector of this invention and the female connector 44 constitutes a meter unit side<br><br>
connector of this invention.<br>
Fig.9 shows the female connector 44 on the meter unit 5 side, which has a pair of guide portions 46, 46 projecting to the left and right from the upper end of a plate-shaped body portion 45 and having circular guide holes 46, 46 formed therein. At its lower end, the body portion 45 is formed with two downward tapering half-split conical guide projections 47, 47, which can engage an outwardly expanding guide surface 252 formed at the inlet of the recess 25i (see Fig.6). These guide projections 47, 47 and the guide surface 25 constitute a centering means of this invention.<br>
As can be seen from Figs.5, 6 and 9, a retaining plate 48 is supported on the upper surface of a pair of bosses 4I4, 41 projecting upwardly from the bottom wall of the housing 41 and is securely held by the bolts 49, 49. The female connector 44 has its guide holes 46i, 46i loosely fitted over the outer circumferences of the bosses 41«, 4I4 and is sandwiched from above and below between the bottom wall of the housing 41 and the retaining plate 48 so that it will not be come out. The diameter of the guide holes 46, 46i is set slightly larger than that of the bosses 41, 41 so that the female connector 44 can be moved relative to the housing 41 over a distance corresponding to the difference between these diameters. The body portion 45 of the female connector 44 is loosely fitted in the ooenina 41,<br><br>
formed in the bottom wall of the housing 41 to allow relative movement of the body portion 45 with respect to the housing 41.<br>
When the meter unit 5 is inserted from above into the meter unit support hole 43 of the rear handle cover 1, even if the body portion 45 of the female connector 44 on the meter unit 5 side is deviated from the recess 25 of the male connector 25 on the busbar embedding substrate 21 (see a chain line in Fig.6), the tapered guide projections 47, 47 of the female connector 44 are guided along the guide surface 262 of the male connector 25, therefore the floatingly supported female connector 44 is automatically centered and joined to the male connector 25. This in turn causes the male terminals 20 ... of the male connector 25 to be inserted and connected to female terminals 50 ... of the female connector 44.<br>
Next, the mounting structure of the starter switch Ss is explained with reference to Figs.10 to 12. The mounting structures of the dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh are virtually the same as that of the starter switch Ss.<br>
The starter switch Ss has a housing 51 made of synthetic resin, an operation knob 53 pivotally supported on the front surface of the housing 51 through a fulcrum pin 52, engagement claws 51, 51 formed on the upper and lower surfaces of the housing 51 respectively, and a female connector 54 embedded in<br><br>
the housing 51. The female connector 54 is integrally embedded in the housing 51 when the housing 51 is injection-molded, with its female terminals 55 ... accommodated in the inner space of the housing 51.<br>
The busbar embedding substrate 21 integrally embedded in the rear handle cover 1 is formed with an opening 26 in which the starter switch Ss is fitted. An opening 34 of the rear handle cover 1 surrounds the opening 26 on the outer side thereof. In the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 .is provided with a male connector 30 which comprises a plurality of male terminals 56 ... integrally formed with the busbars 22 ... and projecting out of the busbar embedding substrate 21. Using a part of the busbars 22 ... as the male terminals 56 ... of the male connector 30 as described above, the number of parts of the male connector 30 can be reduced to simplify the structure and minimize the possibility of wire break and poor contact.<br>
Then, when the starter switch Ss is inserted into the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 through the opening 34 of the rear handle cover 1, the male terminals 56 ... of the male connector 30 installed in the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 automatically fit into the female terminals 55 ... of the female connector 54 embedded in the housing 51 of the starter switch Ss, readily completing the electric connection between the starter<br><br>
switch Ss and the busbars 22 ... in the busbar embedding substrate 21. When the starter switch Ss is fully inserted into the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21, the engagement claws Sl, 51 provided to the housing 51 engage claw receiving portions 26i, 26i provided in the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 to prevent the starter switch Ss from coming out. Then, a flange Slj of the housing 51 of the starter switch Ss fits the opening 34 of the rear handle cover 1 to conceal the opening 26 of the busbar embedding substrate 21.<br>
Because the wiring for the meter unit 5, starter switch Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh, all of which are mounted to the rear handle cover 1 of the motorcycle V, is carried out by the busbars 22 ... embedded in the busbar embedding substrate 21 provided to the rear handle cover 1 as described above, not only can the nxomber of parts and manhours required for wiring be reduced substantially but the possibility of short-circuit, wire break and erroneous assembly can also be reduced, compared with a case where the conventional wiring harness is used. Durability is also improved over what is obtained by the wiring harness. Further, because simply inserting the meter unit 5 into the meter unit support hole 43 of the rear handle cover 1 completes an electric connection between the meter unit 5 and the busbars 22 ... and because simply inserting the starter switch<br><br>
Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh into the openings 26-29 of the busbar embedding substrate 21 completes the electric connection between the switches Ss, Sd, Sw, Sh and the busbars 22 ..., manhours required for assembly can be reduced significantly. Because the meter unit 5 is inserted from outside the rear handle cover 1, the handle cover can be assembled beforehand, which improves work efficiency. Furthermore, because the female terminals 55 ... of the female connector 54 are installed inside the switches Ss, Sd, Sw, Sh, the female terminals 55 . . . can be protected against deformation and damage thereof, enhancing the electric contact reliability.<br>
Next, by referring to Figs. 14 and 15 a second embodiment of this invention will be explained. In the second embodiment, constitutional elements alike to those of the first embodiment carry like reference nximerals.<br>
While in the first embodiment the meter unit 5 is inserted downwardly from outside of the rear handle cover 1 for assembly, in the second embodiment the meter unit 5 is assembled by inserting it rearward from inside the rear handle cover 1.<br>
That is, at the central part of the rear handle cover 1 the meter unit support hole 43 is formed in the longitudinal direction and the meter unit 5 is inserted from the inside toward the outside of the rear handle cover 1, i.e., from the front side of the<br><br>
vehicle body toward the rear side thereof. At this time, engagement claws 4I2, 41 formed on the lateral sides of the housing 41 engage claw receiving portions Ig, Ig formed to face the meter unit support hole 43, thereby the meter unit 5 is secured. Because the meter unit 5 is inserted in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body, the male terminals 20 ... of the male connector 25 provided on the busbar embedding substrate 21 side and the female terminals 50 ... of the female connector 44 provided on the meter unit 5 side are arranged in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle body.<br>
Insertion of the meter unit 5 from the inside toward the outside of the rear handle cover 1 increases the degree of freedom of design for the meter unit 5. For example, even when the meter unit 5 increases in size due to an addition of constitutional parts, it is only enough to form a window which allows a display portion of the meter unit 5 to be seen from outside of the rear handle cover 1 (the rider side), thereby an appearance of the meter unit 5 improves.<br>
Next, a third embodiment of this invention will be described by referring to Fig.16.<br>
While the starter switch Ss of the first embodiment has its female connector 54 embedded in the housing 51 when the housing 51 is injection-molded, the starter switch Ss of the third embodiment has its female connector 54 mounted in the housing 51 after<br><br>
the housing 51 is injection-molded. That is, the female connector 54 has a pair of engagement claws 54, 54i, and inserting the female connector 54 into the housing 51 causes the engagement claws 54, 54 to engage claw receiving portions 5I3, 5I3 of the housing 51, thereby the female connector 54 is fixed to the housing 51. The female terminals 55 ... are embedded in the housing 51 beforehand and, when the female connector 54 is inserted into the housing 51 the female terminals are fitted into the female connector 54.<br>
Next, by referring to Figs. 17 and 18 a fourth embodiment of this invention will be described.<br>
The starter switch Ss of the fourth embodiment has its female terminals 55 ... loosely fitted in the female connector 54 embedded in the housing 51, and a switch terminals 57 ... embedded beforehand in the housing 51 are fitted in one end of the female terminals 55 ... When the male connector 30 is connected to the female connector 54, the male terminals 56 ... integrally extending from the busbars 22 ... fit the other end of the female terminals 55 ... ,thus electrically connecting the starter switch Ss to the busbars 22 ...  Since the female terminals<br>
55	... are restricted inside the female connector 54, the female terminals 55 ... are not pulled out of the female connector 54 together with the male terminals<br>
56	... when pulling out the male terminals 56 ...<br><br>
Embodiments of this invention have been described in detail. It should be noted that various design modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
For example, as to the invention described in claims 1, 2 and 4. the conductors are not limited to the busbars 22 ... but may use a wiring harness. The centering means of claim 4 may be formed in an arbitrary structure. For example, the positional relation between the guide projections 47 and the guide surface 252 can be reversed. The switches of the invention described in claim 5 are not limited to the starter switch Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh and may be any other type of switches. Further, the electric parts of this invention described in claims 6 to 9 are not limited to the meter unit 5, starter switch Ss, dimmer switch Sd, winker switch Sw and horn switch Sh and may be any other type of switches. While in the above embodiments the busbars 22 ... are formed of metal plate strips, they may have an arbitrary cross section and be formed of a metal bar of circular or rectangular cross section. Although the above embodiments have the busbar embedding substrate 21 supported on the rear handle cover 1, it is possible to support the busbar embedding substrate 21 at any part of the handle cover. Further, it is also possible to reverse the positional relation between<br><br>
the female connector 44 and the male connector 25<br><br><br>
