CHANNEL ESTIMATION AND CHANNEL QUALITY INDICATOR (CQI) MEASUREMENTS FOR A HIGH-SPEED DOWNLINK GPRS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field<br>
|00011	The present invention relates to wireless communication systems generally and<br>
specifically to scheduling data transmissions in a Global System for Mobile communications referred to as GSM.<br>
Background<br>
[0002J	The    Global    System    for    Mobile    communications    (GSM)    wireless<br>
telecommunications standard defines a set of widely available digital communications protocols for use within a digital wireless telephone system. The GSM specifications are developed by an international effort and adopted by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI, 06921 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France). The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a set of new GSM bearer services that provides high-speed packet-mode transmission within the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and towards external networks. And, the Enhanced Data rates for a Global Evolution (EDGE) were introduced to improve circuit switch and packet switch GSM data services. At the time of inception of the GSM/GPRS/EDGE standard, which supports voice and high rate packet data services, the use of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) within the GSM/GPRS/EDGE Over-The-Air (OTA) protocol increased the efficiency with which the given radio frequency bandwidth could be used to conduct wireless telephone calls. Even increasing services and demand require efficient ways of providing system resources to more and more data users. There is a need, therefore, to provide high speed data transmissions in a GSM/GPRS/EDGE environment.<br>

[0004]		One embodiment provides an apparatus, in a wireless communication system<br>
supporting voice and high packet data services, which performs channel estimation, determines a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) index, and returns assignment/data information based on the CQI index. According to this embodiment, an algorithm enables rotation of Mobile Station (MS) users such that each one will benefit from measuring all timeslots of the frame resulting in more reliable and accurate transmission of information.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
|002O)	The word "exemplary" is used exclusively herein to mean "serving as an<br>
example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. While the various aspects of the present invention are presented in the drawings, the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale unless specifically indicated.<br>
[0021J	The present invention relates to bundling several timeslots of a frame together in<br>
order to estimate a channel's quality and to send assignment and data information to the mobile station (MS) with a good channel quality within the existing GSM/GPRS/EDGE system. One embodiment also provides an algorithm which enables rotation of MS users such that each one will benefit from measuring all timeslots of the frame resulting in more reliable and accurate transmission. In a high rate packet data system, upon receipt of the paging messages from one or more base stations, the MS measures the Signal-to-Noise-and-Interference Ratio (SNIR) of the forward link signals and sends a Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) to the Base Station (BS) at each frame or bundle of timeslots. This BS, in turn, sends assignment/data information to the MS which has good channel quality.<br>
[0022]	The following discussion develops the preferred embodiment by first presenting<br>
a system supporting a GSM/GPRS/EDGE system. Next, a TDM scheduling scheme for link adaptation is introduced. Then the TDM scheduling scheme, which includes use of<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br><br>
channel estimation experienced by each mobile station and which may be used by the<br>
scheduler to optimally allocate the radio resources is explained. Finally, it is helpful to<br>
discuss   how   this   TDM   scheduling   scheme   may   be   implemented   into   the<br>
GSM/GPRS/EDGE system and provide the above-mentioned benefits.<br>
[0023]	Note the embodiments are provided as exemplars throughout this discussion;<br>
however, alternate embodiments may incorporate various aspects without departing from the scope of the present invention. Specifically, the present invention is applicable to a data processing system, a wireless communication system, a unidirectional broadcast system, and any other system desiring efficient transmission of information.<br>
Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)<br>
|0024]	The    Global    System    for    Mobile    communications    (GSM)    wireless<br>
telecommunications standard is set of widely available digital communications protocols for use within a digital wireless telephone system. The GSM specifications were developed by an international effort and have been adopted by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI, 06921 Sophia Antipolis Cedex, France). The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a set of new GSM bearer services that provides high-speed packet-mode transmission within the PLMN and towards external networks. And, the Enhanced Data rates for a Global Evolution (EDGE) was introduced to improve circuit switch and packet switch GSM data services. A wireless telephone system configured in a manner consistent with the use of the GSM/GPRS/EDGE standards is shown in FIG. 1. GSM Mobile-services Switching Center (MSC) 16 switches or connects telephone calls between the wireless system access network, namely the Base Station Subsystems (BSS) 15, and wireline based Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 18, which may also be a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN). GSM MSC 16 provides telephone switching, billing, subscriber unit tracking, subscriber unit authorization, and some handoff control functionality.<br>
[0025]	BSS  15 is comprised of base station controller (BSC) 14 and any base<br>
transceiver station(s) (BTS) 12 coupled thereto. As defined in the GSM specifications, the interface between GSM MSC 16 and BSS 15 is referred to as the GSM "A or Iu-CS<br>
interface," which separates the GSM/GPRS/EDGE network switching equipment from the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based radio equipment.   BSC 14 is<br><br>
WO 2005/117464<br><br>
PCT/US2005/015049<br><br>
6<br>
involved with handoff processing and signal processing resource allocation within BTSs<br>
12 so that multiple subscriber units 10, also referred to as Mobile Stations (MSs), can<br>
conduct telephone calls simultaneously. BTS 12 interfaces the subscriber units 10 via<br>
radio frequency (RF) signals and a well defined OTA protocol to the<br>
GSM/GPRS/EDGE wireless network. BTS 12 comprises radio transmission and<br>
reception devices, up to and including antenna devices, and also all the signal<br>
processing specific to the radio interface. BTSs can be considered as complex radio<br>
modems. Subscriber unit MS 10 provides radio and processing functions to access the<br>
GSM/GPRS/EDGE network through the radio interface to either the user of subscriber<br>
unit 10 or some other terminal equipment, such as a facsimile machine or personal<br>
computer. A particular subscriber unit MS 10 may switch the BTS 12 with which it<br>
interfaces as its location changes, but can only communicate with one BTS 12 at a given<br>
instant. Within this application, the capability to switch from one BTS 12 to another<br>
BTS 12, where only one radio interface exists at any instance, is referred to as<br>
subscriber unit hard handoff.<br>
[0026]	To make a wireless telephone call, a network connection must be established<br>
between subscriber unit 10, often referred to as a "mobile unit," and PSTN 18. PSTN 18 is the CONVENTIONAL wireline telephone system. To conduct the telephone call in a mobile fashion, a portion of the network connection is formed via the exchange of Radio Frequency (RF) signals between subscriber unit 10 and BTS 12. The remaining portion of the network connection is typically formed through wire-based connections<br>
that pass through BSS 15 and through GSM MSC 16. In accordance with the GSM/GPRS/EDGE OTA protocol, which is one of the protocols that make up the<br>
GSM/GPRS/EDGE wireless telecommunications standard, TDMA technology is used to establish a set of channels within the above identified RF signals used to interface a subscriber unit 10 with a BTS 12. These channels are used to separate and distinguish the various sets of data associated with the various telephone calls being made at any given time. The various sets of data include user data which normally takes the form of digitized audio information, and signaling data which is comprised of the signaling<br>
messages used to orchestrate the processing of a telephone call.<br>
[0027]	At the time of the inception of the GSM/GPRS/EDGE standard, the use of<br>
TDMA within the GSM/GPRS/EDGE OTA protocol increased the efficiency with which the given radio frequency bandwidth could be used to conduct wireless telephone<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br>
calls with respect to older analog cellular systems. Increasing the efficiency with which<br>
the available  radio frequency bandwidth i5 used is desirable because only a limited<br>
amount of RF bandwidth exists, and the amount of bandwidth is usually the limiting factor as to the number of calls that can be conducted by a particular wireless cellular telephone system. Since the inception of the GSM/GPRS/EDGE wireless telecommunications protocol, however, other wireless technologies have been perfected that allow a greater number of telephone calls to be conducted in a given RF bandwidth. Since efficient use of radio frequency bandwidth is highly desirable, the use of these more efficient technologies is now preferred. The GSM/GPRS/EDGE system supports transmission and reception of voice, high speed circuit switch data and high speed packet data.<br>
[0028]	FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating voice data sent on timeslot 1 of the transmitting<br>
unit (Tx) frame 20. Note that transmission and reception of information are viewed from the Base Station (BS). Since voice data has to be transmitted and received on the same timeslot, this data will be received on timeslot 1 of the receiving unit (Rx) frame 25. One frame 20 is made up of eight timeslots. Note timeslot 30 is identified for clarity. An architectural offset of three timeslots between the Tx and the Rx is required because the data cannot be transmitted and received at the same time. That is, the data is received on frame 25 with an offset of three timeslots. The information is received in the same order sent. This offset includes at least one timeslot 30 to allow for transition between transmission and reception of the data. The BS notifies the MS of the assignment of the timeslot receiving data. The upper layer signaling in the BS enables reservation of the timeslot.<br>
[0029]	FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating high speed circuit switch data sent on timeslots 1<br>
and 2 of the transmitting unit (Tx) frame 35. The high speed circuit switch data, which uses timeslots, will be received on timeslot 1 of receiving unit (Rx) frame 40. Again, eight timeslots form a frame 35 and an offset of three timeslots between the Tx frame 35 and the Rx frame 40 is used because the data cannot be transmitted and received at the same time. Usually only one timeslot, i.e. timeslot 45, is used for transition between the transmission and reception states. This configuration enables more flexibility since the<br>
data is spread over two timeslots for transmission of data and spread over one timeslot for reception. Note that this configuration is unnecessary when voice is sent because the number of additional timeslots does not affect the quality of transmission or<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br>
systems employing such an offset. Timeslot 75 is used to switch from transmission to reception. As observed in FIG. 5, timeslots on the BS Tx frame 65 that are used for transmission need not be consecutive since dynamic sharing is allowed between users. The upper layer signaling in the BS makes an assignment where it selects a pool of MS users. Then, with the help of in-band signaling, it makes an allocation where it selects a<br>
single MS user in the pool of users.   This assignment is not permanent since it is<br>
performed on a frame by frame basis.<br>
[0032]	As mentioned above, FIG. 1 demonstrates the interaction between the various<br>
components of the GSM/GPRS/EDGE system.  The MS 10 differs in many ways from<br>
the MS for voice and circuit data services described above. The MS 10 has multi-slot capability which allows increased flexibility and capability. For example, significant differences in the maximum number of slots that can be used for sending/receiving data and in the minimum number of slots separating reception/transmission can be observed. The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) 95 is the node that is serving the MS 10. The SGSN 95 establishes a mobility management context containing information pertaining to mobility and security for the MS 10. The SGSN 95 also collects charging information. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) 90 is the node that is accessed by an external packet data network, via the Gb-interface. Routing information stored in the GGSN 90 is used to tunnel user data to the MS 10's current point of attachment, i.e. the SGSN 95. The GGSN 90 also collects charging information. In a conventional GSM/GPRS/EDGE system, a scheduler that determines the timeslot to be used by each<br>
           terminal is located in base station controller (BSC) 14. As will be described below, in<br>
           the present invention, the scheduler is located in the base station (BTS) 12 to provide for<br>
           fast scheduling.<br>
(0033J	In FIG. 6, the power received at the MS 10 is plotted against time.   A fade<br>
margin, which represents fading of the channel, can be calculated between the highest point of power 105 and the lowest point of power 110. Since this fade margin becomes much smaller in a TDM scheduling scheme described below, it is beneficial to use this known technique within the existing GSM system in order to improve system performance and signal quality.<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br>
TDM Scheduling Scheme For Link Adaptation<br>
[0034]	In accordance with the embodiment of the data communication system of the<br>
present invention, downlink data transmission occurs from one BTS 115 to one MS 125<br>
(see FIG. 8) at or near the maximum data rate which can be supported by the downlink<br>
and the system, including the possible use of higher order modulation (8PSK) that<br>
allows higher data rates in EDGE. Uplink data communication can occur from one MS<br>
120 to one or more BTS 115. Data is partitioned into data packets being transmitted<br>
over one or more timeslots. At each frame or multislot, the BTS 115 can direct data<br>
transmission to any MS 120,125 which is in communication with the BTS 115.<br>
(0035]	Initially, each MS 120, 125 establishes communication with a BTS 115 using a<br>
 predetermined access procedure. In this connected state, the MS 120,125 can receive<br>
data and control messages 127 from the BTS 115, and is able to transmit data and<br>
control messages 127 to the BTS 115. The MS 120,125 then monitors the down link<br>
for transmissions from the base stations in the active set of the MS 120, 125.<br>
Specifically, the MS 120, 125 measures the signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio<br>
(SNIR) of the down link pilot from the serving base stations, as received at the MS 120,<br>
125. Depending on the received SNIR, the MS 120, 125 will send a Channel Quality<br>
Indicator (CQI) back to the BTS 115. As shown in FIG. 7, each MS 120,125 will send a<br>
CQI to the BTS 115 at each time frame.<br>
[0036]	As illustrated in FIG. 9, at each frame, MSI and MS2 will each send a CQI to<br>
the BS. Based on these two parameters, the BS will in turn choose a MS based on an internal algorithm that takes into account, among other factors, the CQI reports from all mobile stations and it will transmit a assignment information, such as within a header, to the selected MS. The BS will also send data to this MS at a slightly later time, as shown in FIG. 8.<br>
            Implementation   of   TDM   Scheduling   Scheme   For   Link   Adaptation   In   a<br>
            GSM/GPRS/EDGE system<br>
[0037]	HSD-PRS (High Speed Downlink GPRS) allows the bundling of several<br>
timeslots in order to create a Data Optimized/ Data Voice (DO/DV) like shared channel. As such, HSD-PRS introduces concepts such as fast feedback, fast CQI reporting, and so forth, within the existing GSM/GPRS/EDGE framework.  Channel estimation and<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br>
CQI measurements are an important process in HSD-PRS since the optimal allocation of the downlink resources is based on them.<br>
|0038)	As demonstrated in FIG. 13, HSD-PRS bundles together several timeslots into<br>
one channel, which is then directed towards a single user. All terminals will be able to receive those timeslots and read the header. The header indicates which, among the terminals sharing the HSD-PRS channel, is the intended recipient. The receiving terminal must read the data part, whereas all the other terminals can read none, a portion, or all of the data part.<br>
100391	For the purpose of reporting, the important part of a timeslot is the midamble, as<br>
shown in FIG. 14. Every timeslot contains a midamble or center point. The MS uses the midamble for channel estimation and CQI measurements. Consequently, every terminal will read a certain number of timeslots within a TDMA frame of the HSD-PRS channel. It will then average the measurement and estimation performed over each of the timeslots. This average will be more accurate if the terminal has been reading all the downlink timeslots. The accuracy of such reporting can therefore be included in the report itself, so that the network can weigh the reports accordingly. The reports, together with the weights, will be used by the network to perform fast scheduling of the terminals.<br>
|0040]	If the transmit power changes dramatically from slot to slot, the CQI reporting<br>
may be affected and the base station would have to adjust its scheduling accordingly. In<br>
such a case, the mobile station should report which slots were considered in the estimate<br>
            of the CQI, so that the base station can compensate for the CQI value with an offset,<br>
which may be a function of the transmit power in each of the slots that were used by the<br>
 mobile station for the CQI estimate.<br>
[0041]	Reporting is a fundamental part of HSD-PRS. The network will perform a fast<br>
scheduling of the downlink resource based on such reporting.   Fast scheduling takes<br>
place on a TDMA frame basis.   It includes both the decision of which user is the<br>
recipient of the information sent on that TDMA frame, as well as the coding and<br>
modulation parameters.   Since the HSD-PRS spans over multiple timeslots within a<br>
TDMA frame, the corresponding uplink timeslots can be used for reporting. Reporting<br>
is based on channel estimation.   This is in turn performed by the terminals on the<br>
midambles transmitted on the downlink.<br><br>
WO 2005/117464<br><br>
PCT7US2005/015049<br><br>
12<br>
(0042)	As described in the previous section, a design choice has been done to prevent<br>
the terminals from having to transmit and receive at the same time.  Due to the GSM<br>
offset of three timeslots between transmitting and receiving, it is possible to achieve<br>
this. However, some of the terminals will have to interrupt the channel estimation early<br>
in order to start transmitting on the uplink. One timeslot of separation is needed<br>
between the reception and transmission if the mobile station does not support<br>
simultaneous reception and transmission, which is the most common case.<br>
[0043]	By implementing the allocation of CQI and fast scheduling offered by the TDM<br>
scheduling scheme into GSM, it is possible to obtain a more advanced system with<br>
increased capacity. As shown in FIG. 10, each MS will send a CQI report to the BS on<br>
the MS Tx frame 135. That is, MSI will send its CQI on timeslot 0, MS2 will send its<br>
CQI on timeslot 1, and so forth. Based on the values of the CQI received by the BS, the<br>
BS will send the header(H)/data information on the BS Tx frame 130 to the user<br>
selected based an all CQI reports. In FIG. 7, as an example, the MS with the highest<br>
CQI could be selected. A fairer scheduler would also consider the past history of<br>
allocations, the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to the MS, and the priority<br>
of the data that needs to be transmitted to the MS. An example of a scheduler is a<br>
"proportional fair" scheduler which considers requested data rate and throughput in<br>
scheduling transmissions. Again there is an offset of three timeslots between the two<br>
frames because the MS may not be able to receive and transmit at the same time. One<br>
timeslot may be used to transmit the header information. Each user will read the header<br>
information and will know which user the data is intended for. Note that this header<br>
may contain information regarding different modulations applying various data rates.<br>
Other methods of scheduling may also be used.<br>
(0044]	In conventional systems, the BSC decided which timeslots were to be used for<br>
data transmission and which ones for fast scheduling (header information), at what<br>
frequency the information was to be sent, and which users were entitled to use the<br>
resources. In the present invention, these tasks are no longer performed by the BSC, but<br>
are now assigned to the BS. This allows for even faster scheduling and thus increasing<br>
the overall system capacity, since higher order modulations (e.g. 8PSK) requiring good<br>
channel condition can be used more often.<br>
[00451	Referring to FIG. 10, as the number of timeslots increase in a frame, the CQI<br>
becomes more reliable and accurate.   As mentioned above, the average measurement<br><br>
WO 2005/117464	PCT/US2005/015049<br>
and estimation becomes more accurate when the terminal has been reading all the<br>
transmit timeslots. Therefore, MS3 and MS4 will provide the most reliable CQI<br>
estimate because timeslots 141 and 142 of the UL 135 can measure all BS Tx 130 slots.<br>
In order for each user to benefit from receipt of maximum data due to the position of the<br>
timeslot in the frame, an algorithm which rotates the MS users is designed. FIG. 11 is a<br>
flowchart that incorporates such an algorithm. In block 145, the receiving unit in the<br>
MS will determine whether the data is intended for the MS. If it is, the MS will (block<br>
150) position itself on the last timeslot available in order to prepare for proper<br>
transmission of the data. If the data is not intended for the MS, the algorithm in block<br>
155 performs a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of users enabling the correct<br>
MS to receive the data on the last timeslot available. The order of the reports from the<br>
mobile stations that are not receiving the downlink is changed. This rotation ensures<br>
fairness, since the timeslot where the uplink report takes place determines also the<br>
accuracy of the report itself. These steps will be repeated for the next frame as indicated<br>
by Mock 160. This algorithm also makes sure that two users are not transmitting on the<br>
same timeslot.<br>
[0046]	By way of another example, as observed in FIG. 12, timeslot 175 of the Rx<br>
frame 170 can measure only timeslots 195 and 200 of the Tx frame 165. Timeslot ISO of the Rx frame 170 can measure timeslots 195, 200, and 205 of the Tx frame 165. Finally, timeslots 185 and 190 of the BS Rx frame 170 can measure all timeslots 195, 200, 205, and 210 of the Tx frame 165. In this example, timeslot 190 is always receiving data. Timeslot 190 stays in the same position because it is still receiving data. After rotation as shown in the second part of the Rx frame 170, using the above-mentioned algorithm, timeslot 180 is now located at the third position on Rx frame 170. Because of its new position, timeslot 180 can now measure all timeslots 215, 220, 225, and 230 of the Tx frame 165.   This system ensures fairness in receipt of data. The<br>
algorithm will provide rotation of users such that each one will benefit from receipt of<br>
maximum   data.      One   embodiment  incorporates  a  "proportional   fair"  scheduler<br>
mechanism into the rotation algorithm. In this way, the rotation considers both channel<br>
quality and throughput.<br>
