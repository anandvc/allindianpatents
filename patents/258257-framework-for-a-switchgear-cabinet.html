Framework for a switchgear cabinet<br>
The invention relates to a framework for a switchgear cabinet, which framework comprises a base part, a cover part and four vertical frame legs, with the base part and/or the cover part being made up of two longitudinal struts and two depthwise struts which are formed from angled portions of a single-piece stamped and bent part, with the base part and/or the cover part having, in the four corner regions, receptacles which are open towards the outside and into which the vertical frame legs are inserted and connected to the base and/or cover frame, and with the angled sections Which form the longitudinal and depthwise struts forming, in the region  of   the   receptacles,   centring   surfaces, supporting surf aces and-, weld edges for the vertical frame legs to be inserted and welded in two planes.<br>
A framework of this type ds known from DE 196 47 790 C2. In this case/ the base  part simultaneously serves as a base for the switchgear cabinet and, as a base frame, forms an insertion opening for the connection cables and the like. Given identical design of the top part, this embodiment of the framework requires an additional covering at least in this upper region of the switchgear cabinet framework.<br>
If a framework of this type is used to produce switchgear cabinets to be placed outdoors or in damp areas, a hermetically leak-tight interior is then required, with the transitions between the framework and the wall elements and the cabinet doors particularly being sealed off by means of additional sealing elements. A completely screened interior of the switchgear cabinet is often, -also required, it being<br>
possible for the sealing  elements to assume the screening function.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a framework for a switchgear cabinet of the type mentioned in the introduction, which framework is hermetically sealed off and screened at least in the base and cover region without additional means having to be used, and to which framework wall elements and a cabinet door can be easily fitted in order to complete sealing and screening.<br>
According to the invention,  this object is firstly achieved in that the base part and/or the cover part each have a closed outer plate which is averted from the interior of the framework,  in that the angled sections which form the  longitudinal and depthwise struts have vertical spacer sections in the direction of  the  interior- of the • framework and merge  with horizontal, outwardly directed supporting sections, in that vertical outer sections adjoin the  supporting sections,  in  that  the  outer  sections  merge  with horizontal,' inwardly directed centring sections which, with their end faces which are recessed into the receptacles, form the centring surface, and in that the support sections end in weld edges in the receptacles, which weld edges are aligned with and welded to the outer contour of the inserted vertical frame legs. In the same way, the object of the invention is achieved in that the base part and/or the cover part each have a closed inner plate Which faces the interior of the framework, in that the angled sections which form the longitudinal and depthwise struts have vertical spacer sections which are averted from• the interior of the framework and merge: With horizontal, inwardly directed supporting sections, in that vertical outer sections which are directed backwards and merge with horizontal, inwardly directed termination sections  adjoin these supporting section's, in that the termination sections<br>
merge with vertical; inner sections which end in horizontal, outwardly directed auxiliary supporting sections, in that the inner , plate has, in the corner regions, recesses which, with their edges, form centring surfaces and weld edges for the vertical frame legs on the  supporting sections and auxiliary supporting sections with the  vertical spacer sections terminating with  the  centring  surf aces of the inner plate in the region of the recesses.<br>
In either case, the base part and cover part on the lower and upper face of the framework provide complete sealing off and screening and can be produced as simple stamped and bent parts Furthermore, the angled longitudinal and depthwise struts of the base part and cover part provide ideal options for attaching wall elements and •a' -cabinet door with sealing and/or screening elements.on . profiled sides of the vertical frame legs also being available at angled sections of the base and cover part in order to seal off and/or screen the interior--of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
If provision is made in the two design variants for the vertical spacer sections -to be shorter than the vertical outer sections of the longitudinal and depthwise struts or: for the recessed outer sections of the longitudinal and depthwise struts of the base and/or cover part to be shorter than the vertical spacer sections, the interior can then be utilized in an optimum fashion for installing components and the like.<br>
The connection of the vertical frame legs in the outwardly directed receptacles of the base and/or cover part can be improveid: by the1 vertical outer sections of the longitudinal and depthwise. struts abutting and being connected, preferably welded, to one another in the corner regions, and by the weld edges of the horizontal support sections' and the outer contours of<br>
the vertical frame -legs coinciding with the abutting spacer sections of the, longitudinal and depthwise struts in the corner regions of the base and/or cover part, or by the recessed outer sections of the longitudinal and depthwise struts of the base and/or cover part being shorter than the vertical spacer sections. <br>
The vertical frame legs . can then be welded in the receptacles in two spaced-apart planes, and this increases the flexUral strength between vertical frame legs and the base and/or cover part.<br>
Support for the vertical frame legs in the base and/or cover part is improved in the two embodiments by the horizontal supporting sections of the longitudinal and depthwise struts extending into the corner regions of the base and/or cover part and being connected to one another, preferably forming welded closed support surfaces for the vertical frame legs, or by the horizontal supporting sections and the horizontal auxiliary supporting sections of the longitudinal and depthwise struts in the base and/or cover part abutting in the corner regions-, forming outer corners and being connected, preferably welded, to one another, and the supporting sections: and auxiliary supporting sections forming closed support surfaces for the vertical frame legs.<br>
Further advantageous refinements of the two types of framework can be found in the subclaims and the description of exemplary embodiments.<br>
The invention is described in detail with reference to two exemplary embodiments which are illustrated in the drawings, in which: <br><br>
Fig. 1  shows a view of the outer side of the corner of a framework in the region of the base part,<br>
with the vertical frame leg not yet inserted or welded ,into the receptacle of the base part,<br>
Fig. 2 shows the .same view of the base part corner with the vertical .frame leg inserted and welded, <br><br>
Fig. 3 shows a cross section along line Ill-Ill according to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 4 shows the corner connection according to Fig. 2 of the inner contour of the vertical frame leg,<br>
Fig. 5 shows the cross section, which corresponds to Fig. 3, of a base part with a closed inner plate which faces the interior, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a view; which corresponds to Fig. 4, from the inside of a base .corner with a base part according to Figv 5. .<br>
First of all, reference ds made to the fact that the base part 20 is also used as a cover part when in a position in which it is rotated through 180°, and that the two parts are connected to one another by means of four vertical frame legs 10. The same vertical frame legs 10 are used for' the two embodiments, these frame legs defining the outer contour with the profiled sides 11, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 12.4, and defining the inner contour of the vertical frame legs 10 with the profiled sides 12.5, 12; 6 and 12.7. In this case, the cross section of the vertical frame legs 10 forms a mirror image with respect to the diagonal of the base part 20.<br>
The base part 20 (and therefore also the identical cover part 20) has a closed outer plate AP, as can be seen in Fig. 1. 'Longitudinal-'and depthwise struts 30 and 40 are angled away on the four sides, with two longitudinal struts 30 and two depthwise struts 40<br>
being situated opposite one another. The outer face 44 of the outer plate AP forms the placement surface of the framework on the base part 20, whereas it forms the termination surface of the framework on the cover part 20, as shown in the section according to Fig. 3. On the outer plate AP, the vertical spacer sections 33 and 43 are angled away towards the interior. These spacer sections 33 and 43 /merge with horizontal, outwardly directed supporting sections 32 and 42. Vertical outer sections 31 and 41 which, in turn, merge with horizontal centring sections 37 and 47 adjoin these supporting sections 32 and 42.<br>
The vertical spacer sections 33 and 43 abut in the corner regions and can be connected, preferably welded, to one another. <br>
The horizontal centring sections 37 and 47 abut only in the region of the inner side and, with their end faces, bound the centring surfaces -36 and 46. The horizontal supporting sections 32 arid 42' of the- longitudinal and depthwise struts 30-arid 40 extend beyond the end faces of the longitudinal and depthwise struts 30 and 40 into the receptacle 51 - for  the vertical frame leg 10 and form a closed supporting 'surface for the end face 12.8 of the vertical frame leg 10. The outer edges 35 and 45 of the horizontal supporting sections 32 and 42 are matched to the outer contour of the vertical frame leg 10.<br>
If the vertical frame leg 10 is inserted into the receptacle, the profiled sides 12.5 then rest against the end-face centring surfaces 36 and 46 of the horizontal centring sections 37 and 47. The profiled sides 12.4 terminate flush with the vertical outer sections 31 and' 41. As shown -in Fig. 2, a weld seam 50 which is produced' us-ing a, welding device 60 can weld the end face 12.8 of- the vertical frame leg 10 to the outer edges 35 and 45 of the horizontal supporting<br><br>
sections 32 and 42 in a manner following the outer<br>
contour.	<br>
In addition, a: weld seam 50 can close the transition from the vertical outer sections 31 and 41 to the profiled sides-12.5 of the vertical frame leg 10. The lower faces 34 and .44 pi the longitudinal and depthwise struts 30 and 40,are; formed by the outer face of the outer plate AP. As is clearly- shown in Fig. 2, the profiled sides 1.2.3 .,to the profiled sides 12.2 form shoulders which can accommodate angled borders of wall elements or a cabinet door. These transitions can be easily unambiguously closed by means of sealing or screening strips.<br>
As is further shown :in Pig. 1, the horizontal supporting sections 32 and 42 can meet in the region of the inner corner of the longitudinal and depthwise struts 30 and 40-and-be aligned with the inner abutment point of the horizontal centring ' sections 37 and 47. The abutting edges of the horizontal supporting sections 32 and' 42 /can -also 'be connected to one another. As shown, in'the view': according to Fig. 4, the vertical spacer sections 33 and 43 and the vertical outer sections 31 and 41 . can have different heights, with the result that the height of the base and cover part 20 cail be varied. In this way, the interior of the switchgear cabinet can be utilized in an optimum fashion. The horizontal centring sections 37 and 47 can advantageously be provided with rows of fastening receptacles, like the profiled sides 12.5 and 12.6 of the vertical frame legs 10. •<br>
Fig. 5 shows another refinement of the base and cover part 20. A stamped arid bent  part with an inner plate IP is used in this refinement too. This inner plate IP is virtually closed, as indicated by the reference symbol 47'. Recesses -51' - which permit the vertical<br>
frame legs 10 to be inserted are provided only in the corner regions.<br>
The angled portions, on the four sides of the inner plate IP are directed, outwards, that is to say away from the interior of the framework. The first vertical spacer sections  31' .and 41'. merge with horizontal supporting sections 32'  and 42, which are directed inwards.  Vertical outer sections  33'  and 43'  then adjoin these horizontal supporting sections. Inwardly directed termination sections 34' and 44' protrude from these outer sections 33' and 43', the said termination sections defining the standing surface of the base part 20' . The termination sections 34' and 44' are adjoined by inner sections 38'  and .4.8'  which are directed towards the inner plate' IP and 'merge with horizontal, outwardly directed auxiliary supporting sections 39' and 49' . The supporting sections 32' and 42' and the auxiliary supporting sections 39'  and 49'  may form closed supporting.surfaces .for the end faces 12.8' of the vertical frame' legs 10 beneath the recesses 51' in the corner regions of the inner plate IP, while the edges 35' and 4:5'-/ and also 36,' and 46' of the recesses 51'  form centring siirf aces and connection lines for weld seams. The section according to Fig. 5 crosses the depthwise struts 40  and does not differ from the section across the: longitudinal struts 30' of the base and  cover- part  20  The  only difference  is  that reference symbols 40' to 49' change to 30' to 39'.<br>
In this base and cover part 20', the auxiliary supporting sections 39 and 49' can be conducted as far as the supporting :section 32' and 42' and can be connected, preferably welded, to one another. The abutment and centring edges of the recesses 51' in the corner regions are also welded to' the facing profiled sides of the vertical frame legs 10. In addition, the inner section 38' and 48' can be matched to the inner contour of the vertical frame leg10 and be connected,<br>
preferably welded, to said vertical frame leg. Welding is again achieved in two planes in this way, and the strength of the connection is thus improved.<br>
As shown in the view according to Fig. 6, the inner contour of the vertical frame leg 10 then adjoins the recess 51' in the inner plate IP, with the edges 36' and 46' assuming responsibility for abutment and centring of the -vertical frame leg 10. In this case, the end face 12.8' of' the vertical frame leg 10 is positioned on the' supporting surface of the horizontal supporting section 32' and 42' and of the auxiliary supporting section 39' and, respectively, 49'.<br>
In this refinement of the base and cover part 20' too, the vertical spacer' sections 31' and 41' and also the outer sections 33' and 43' 'and inner sections 38' and 48' can be formed with different heights and the inner plate IP can be provided with rows of fastening receptacles over the longitudinal and depthwise struts 30' and 40' in order to increase the installation<br>
options.	'<br>
The outer sections /31'- and '41' can also form outer corners in the! region of the recesses 51', the said outer corners projecting  beyond the outer contour of the vertical frame legs '10. The horizontal supporting sections 32' and 42' and the horizontal auxiliary supporting sections 38' and 48' then terminate flush with the outer faces of the outer sections 31' and 41'. The outer contours of the - vertical frame legs 10 are then welded to the supporting sections 32' and 42' and also auxiliary supporting sections 38' and 48'. In this case, the supporting sections 32' and 42' and the auxiliary supporting sections 38' and 48' may abut on the diagonal of the base and cover part 20' and also be connected, preferably welded, to one another.<br>
According to the invention, identical base and covering<br>
parts 20 can be used on one framework. However, it. is<br>
also feasible to combine different base and covering<br>
parts 20.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
