Detailed Description of the Preferrec Embodiment<br><br>
The exemplifications set out herein i such exemplifications are not to be manner.<br>
lustrate preferred embodiments of the invention, and donstrued as limiting the scope of the invention in any<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 1, a diagram of an shown. Fig. 1 shows a transmitting noise block (130), a digital satellite s<br><br>
!xemplary embodiment of a satellite television system is satellite (110), a parabolic dish antenna (120) with a low et-top box (140) and a television monitor (150).<br><br>
A satellite broadcast system operate s area. In a digital television broadcast from a geosynchronous satellite (11 once each day and sits at approxim a digital television broadcast satellit remains in the same position with receiving antenna (120) to maintain<br>
to broadcast microwave signals to a wide broadcast system, this is accomplished by transmitting the signals )). A geosynchronous satellite (110) orbits the earth ttely 35,786 kilometers above the earths surface. Since (110) generally orbits around the equator it constantly rejspect to positions on the ground. This allows a satellite a fixed look angle.<br><br>
A digital television transmitting satel<br><br>
ite (110) receives a signal from an uplink transmitter and<br><br>
then rebroadcasts the signal back to earth. The altitude of the transmitting satellite (110) allows subscribers in a wide geographical area to receiving the signal. However, the<br><br>
distance from the earth and the seve result in a weak signal being receivec<br><br>
e power conservation requirements of the satellite also by the subscriber. It is therefore critical that the signal<br><br>
be amplified as soon as possible after it is received by the antenna. This requirement is<br><br>
achieved through the placement of a parabolic dish antenna (120).<br><br>
ow noise block (LNB) (130) at the feed horn of the<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a satellite television receiver<br><br>
configuration is shown. Fig. 2 shows switch (240), an indoor unit (250), a f<br><br>
a first LNB (210), a second LNB (220), a third LNB, a rst transmission cable (270), a second transmission<br><br>
cable (260), a third transmission cable (280) and a fourth transmission cable (280).<br><br>
The dish structure of a parabolic ante nna, (120) of Fig. 1 operates in a manner to reflect an incident plane wave such that the en 3rgy from the reflected wave is focused at a point<br><br>
proximate to the surface of the reflec of the parabolic antenna. The distan determined by the radius of the curve<br><br>
:or structure. This point is referred to as the focal point ;e between the reflector structure and the focal point is of the reflector surface. The reflector surface is<br><br>
optimally configured when all the ene rgy focused at the focal point is in phase. This essentially occurs when the energy incident travels an identical distance from the satellite to the focal point. The position of the fecal point can also change depending on the angle of the reflection compared to the incident wave. Exploiting this opportunity to move the focal point<br><br>
allows antenna designers to receive<br><br>
signals from multiple satellites by using a single reflector<br><br>
with multiple LNBs. Each LNB is placed at the resulting focal point for each of the satellite signals incident on the reflector.<br><br>
The exemplary satellite television sigpal signals from three different satellites<br><br>
receiver shown in Fig. 2 is configured to receive using a different LNB (210, 220, 230) at each of the<br><br>
three resulting focal points. Each therefore only the operation of the f<br><br>
the LNBs (210, 220, 230) operate in the same manner, rst LNB (210) will be described.<br><br>
An LNB (210) is positioned at the signal desired. A digital television { frequency range between 12.2 and feed horn integral to the LNB (210) of the signal is increased. The ami frequency RF signal between 950 transmission cable (270) to a switcl connected by a separate transmiss indoor unit (250) the switch routes transmission cable (260) to the i switch 240 has three inputs, each television receiver can operate with can operate with a large number of surface to receive the signal from a<br>
fc cal<br>
point of the reflector (120) of Fig.1, for the satellite ignal that is transmitted by a satellite is typically in the Ku 12.7 GHz. This signal from the satellite is received by a passed to a low noise RF amplifier where the amplitude F lified signal is then downconverted to a relatively lower<br>
end<br>
tie<br>
indc or<br>
1450 MHz. This signal is then conducted by a (240). The switch (240) has a plurality of inputs each on cable to a plurality of LNBs. As determined by the signal from the desired LNB through a second unit (250). IN the exemplary embodiment shown, the connected to one of three LNBs (210, 220, 230). A digital a single LNB, in which case no switch is required, or it LNBs, each positioned with respect to the reflector single satellite.<br><br>
To provide power to the selected LljJB transmission cable (260), via the suHtch finally to the selected LNB (210). The the LNB (210) by a number of low pjass referred to as the LNB line voltage.<br>
, the indoor unit provides a DC voltage to the second (240), via the first transmission cable (270), and<br>
DC signal is isolated both at the indoor unit (250) and and high pass filters. This DC voltage is commonly<br><br>
The satellite television signal receivers When a problem with the system oc remotely diagnose the problems with<br>
are typically located at the subscriber's residence, curs, it is desirable for the service provider to be able to the receiver, thereby possibly avoiding having to send a<br><br>
service technician to the remote loca<br>

ion. If the problem is simple enough, instructions can oblem immediately remedied. If the problem is too , or there is an equipment failure, advanced information<br><br>
on the problem can be provided to the service technician, thereby allowing the technician to<br><br>
bring the required parts or equipmen<br><br>
to the subscriber's location. Among the parameters<br><br>
desirable to be diagnosed remotely in the LNB line voltage.<br><br>

Two data bits are is below the first threshold voltage and/or below the exemplary embodiment, the two thresholds are set in the verification of the LNB line voltage is required, the system of Fig. 2) will follow the test sequence shown in Fig. 4.<br><br>
Referring to Fig. 4 shows a test sequence followed by the system microprocessor of the<br><br>
indoor unit (250 of Fig. 2) when verifii<br><br>
ation of the LNB line voltage is required. First the<br><br>
system microprocessor sets the LNB Bine voltage to 13 volts. (410) Then the microprocessor<br><br>
checks the first output (345) of the f second comparator (355) to ensure<br><br>
rst comparator (320) and the second output (355) of the that the LNB line voltage exceeds 13 volts but is less<br><br>
than 18 volts. (420) If the two outpit data bits indicate that neither the 13 volt threshold has<br><br>
been met or the 18 volt threshold, tt LNB, indicating a fault condition anc<br><br>
is indicates that no 13 volt power is being supplied to the either the subscriber or the service provider is notified.<br><br>
(430) If both the 13 volt threshold a id the 18 volt threshold are exceeded, this indicates that the LNB line voltage is stuck at 18 volts indicating a fault condition and either the subscriber or the service provider is notified. (440) If the 13 volt threshold is exceeded but not the 18 volt threshold, the micro sets the LNB line voltage to 18 volts. (450) The microprocessor then tests the LNB voltage to ensure that it exceeds 18 volts. (460) If the 13 volt threshold is exceeded but not the 18 volt threshold his indicates that no 13 volt power is being supplied to<br><br>
the LNB, indicating a fault condition<br><br>
and either the subscriber or the service provider is<br><br>
notified. (470) If both the 13 volt threshold and the 18 volt threshold are exceeded/both voltages are within desired range ar d the LNB voltage test is concluded. (480)<br><br>

Typically a microprocessor would be modulation (PWM) signal, such as for example, the unit (250 of Fig. 2). The microprocessor applies the Changing the duty cycle of pulse width modulated signal duty cycles and higher DC values for higher duty cycles. :est voltage possible on the inverting input of 740 is the sirable in the application to have the LNB voltage scaled on as in the exemplary embodiment, the first resistor R1 a voltage divider to scale the LNB voltage to a<br>

Referring to Fig. 8 a test sequence is is followed by the system microprocei<br><br>
shown using the ramp method of approximation which &gt;sor of the indoor unit (250 of Fig. 2) when verification of<br><br>
the LNB line voltage is required using the circuitry shown in Fig. 7. When required to test the LNB line voltage, the system microprocessor of the indoor unit (250 of Fig. 2) sets the pulse<br><br>
width modulated signal applied to the microprocessor then reads the outpui<br><br>
first input (730 of Fig. 7) to a 0% duty cycle. (810) The (750 of Fig. 7) of the comparator (740 of Fig. 7). (820).<br><br>
If the output is low, this indicates that (the scaled LNB voltage does not exceed the effective DC value of the filtered PWM signal. If the output is low, the system microprocessor increments the PWM duty cycle by a predetermined amount 830. The system microprocessor then rereads the output (750 of Fig. 7) of the comparator (740 of Fig. 7). (820) This process is repeated until tine comparator output 750 indicates a high state. At this point, the high state of the output indicates that the scaled LNB voltage does exceeds the<br><br>
effective DC value of the filtered PWfV<br>
the LNB line voltage based on the val<br><br>
