				<td>Preparation of sulfamoyl halides<br>
The invention relates to a process for preparing sulfamoyl halides, in particular sulfamoyl chlorides of primary or in particular secondary amides.<br>
Sulfamoyl halides of primary or secondary amines are interesting intermediates for the preparation of active ingredients having sulfonamide or sulfuric diamide structural units. An overview of alkylsulfamoyl chlorides, their preparation and their use can be found in G. Hamprecht et al. Angew. Chem. 93, (1981), p. 151-163.<br>
In principle, sulfamoyl chlorides may be prepared by reacting monoalkylammonium chlorides with sulfonyl chloride, also referred to hereinbelow as sulfuryl chloride (Acta Chem. Scand. 19, (1963), p. 2141 and also DE-A 1242627). A disadvantage of this process is the long reaction times. In addition, the use of sulfonyl chloride leads to a multiplicity of side reactions. In the case of long-chain amines, for example, the chlorinating action of sulfonyl chloride dominates, so that sulfamyl chlorides of such amines are not accessible by this route.<br>
This process is also utilized in WO 98/28280, WO 00/18770, WO 01/64808 and Bull. Soc. Chim. Belg. 93, 1984, p. 920 for the preparation of N-methoxyethyl-N-methylsulfamoyl chloride, N-cyanoethyl-N-methylsulfamoyl chloride, N-allyl-N-methyl- sulfamoyl chloride and bis-N-allylsulfamoyl chloride. The yields found are generally low.<br>
DE-A 2164176 and EP-A 11794 disclose processes for preparing sulfamoyl halides of the formula R-NH-SO2X, where R is an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic radical and X is a halogen atom by reacting a sulfamic acid of the general formula R-NH-SO3H where R is as defined above with an acid halide of phosphorus. The sulfamic acids used as starting materials are prepared by reacting isocyanates R-N=C=0 with sulfuric acid or by reacting disubstituted ureas with oleum. One disadvantage of these processes is that they start from comparatively expensive starting products whose preparation is costly and inconvenient. In addition, as a consequence of the reaction conditions necessary for the preparation of the sulfamic acids (sulfuric acid or oleum), this process is suitable only for the preparation of those sulfamoyl halides which bear a comparatively inert lydrocarbon radical on the nitrogen. This process is unsuitable Eor the preparation of sulfamoyl halides which have reactive jroups, for example olefinic double bonds or triple bonds,<br>
cyanoalkyl groups, alkoxyalkyl groups or aldehydic carbonyl groups.<br>
R. Wegler et al. in J. Liebigs Ann. Chem. (1959), 624, p. 25-29 describe the preparation of N,N-dialkylsulfamoyl chlorides by initially converting the secondary amines or their hydrochlorides by treatment with chlorine to the N-chloroamines which are then converted by reaction with sulfur dioxide in the presence of chlorine to the sulfamoyl chlorides. An alternative described is the reaction of dialkylamines with sulfur dioxide in carbon tetrachloride with subsequent reaction of the resulting thioamidic acids with chlorine to give the sulfamoyl chlorides. A disadvantage of both processes is the use of elemental chlorine, which limits the process to those amines which have no groups reactive towards chlorine. Also, the intermediate generated in the first process variants is a very unstable N-chloroamine which is very problematic in its handling.<br>
The German patent 946710 describes the preparation of sulfamoyl chlorides by reacting carbamoyl chlorides with sulfur trioxide.<br>
R.E. Olson et al., J. Med. Chem. (1999), 42, p. 1189 describe the preparation of isobutylsulfamoyl chloride from isobutylamine by initially reacting isobutylamine with chlorosulfonic acid and reacting the resulting isobutylammonium salt of isobutylsulfamic acid with phosphorus pentachloride. However, the yields obtained are not satisfactory.<br>
Although a multiplicity of processes for preparing sulfamoyl chlorides is known from the prior art, no efficient process for preparing sulfamoyl chlorides has yet been provided which is not restricted to the preparation of sulfamoyl chlorides of inert amines which have none of the abovementioned reactive groups, and which allows the amines to be used directly as starting materials.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide such a process.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by a process in which a primary or secondary amine is initially reacted with at least equimolar amounts of sulfur trioxide or a sulfur trioxide source in the presence of at least equimolar amounts of a tertiary amine A2 and the resulting ammonium sulfamate is reacted with at least the amount of a phosphorus halide required by the stoichiometry. <br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for preparing sulfamoyl halides of primary or secondary amines, comprising the following steps:<br>
i)	reacting a primary or secondary amine Al with at least equimolar amounts of SO3 or an SO3 source in the presence of at least equimolar amounts of a tertiary amine A2, based in each case on the amine Al, and<br>
ii)	reacting the reaction mixture obtained in step i) with at least the amount of a phosphorus halide required by the stoichiometry.<br>
The process according to the invention is best described by the reaction equation shown in scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1:<br><br>
In scheme 1, RXR2-NH represents a primary or secondary amine, Al, A2 represents a tertiary amine and Hal represents a halogen atom which has been transferred from a phosphorus halide.<br>
Examples of suitable primary or secondary amines are those of the formulae IA and IB<br>
R1-NH2	(IA); R1R2N-H	(IB),<br>
where<br>
R1 and R2 are each independently Ci-C2o-alkyl, C2-C2o-alkenyl or C2-C2o-alkynyl, each of which may be unsubstituted or substituted by CN, N02, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci-C4-alkylthio, formyl, Ci-C4-alkylcarbonyl, C1-C4-alkoxycarbony1,<br>
Ci-C4-alkylaminocarbonyl, Ci-C4-dialkylaminocarbonyl, Ci-C4-alkylsulfinyl, Ci-C4-alkylsulfonyl, C3-Cio-cycloalkyl, phenyl which may itself have 1, 2, 3 or 4 substituents selected from halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl, Cj-^-alkoxy, Cj-C4-fluoroalkyl, Ci-C4-alkyloxycarbonyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, formyl, nitro or cyano,<br>

R1 and R2 together may also form a saturated or partially<br>
unsaturated 5- to 8-membered nitrogen heterocycle which may itself be substituted by Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy and/or Ci-C4-haloalkyl, and have one or 2 carbonyl groups or thiocarbonyl groups and/or one or two further heteroatoms selected from 0, S and N as ring members.<br>
The organic molecular moieties specified here and hereinbelow for the substituents or as radicals of phenyl and heterocyclyl radicals represent collective terms for individual listings of the individual group members, and the expression Cn-Cm specifies the possible number of carbon atoms in the molecular moiety. All hydrocarbon chains, i.e. all alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl moieties, may be straight-chain or branched. Unless stated otherwise, halogenated substituents preferably bear from one to six identical or different halogen atoms. The definition of halogen in each case is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>

With regard to the tertiary amines A2, there are in principle no restrictions. Suitable amines A2 include trialkylamines, preferably trialkylamines having Ci-C4-alkyl groups, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, dimethylethylamine, dimethy 1-n-propylamine, tr i-n-propylamine, tr iisopropy 1 amine, tri-n-butylamine, dimethyl-n-butylamine, N,N-dialkyl-N- cycloalkylamines preferably having Ci-C4-alkyl groups and C6-C8-cycloalkyl groups, e.g. N,N-dimethyl-N-cyclohexylamine, and also N,N-dialkylanilines preferably having Ci-C4-alkyl groups, in particular N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-diethylaniline, N-methyl-N-ethylaniline, heterocyclic tertiary amines such as N-alkylmorpholines, N-alkylimidazoles and N-alkylpiperidines, such as N-methylmorpholine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-methylpiperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, N-ethylimidazole and N-methylimidazole, and also tertiary amines having an sp2 nitrogen atom, which are also referred to hereinbelow as tertiary amines of the pyridine type. In addition to pyridine itself, these also include a-, p- and y-picoline, pyrimidine, pyridazine, 2,4-lutidine, 2,6-lutidine, quinoline, quinaldine and also N-alkylimidazoles such as N-methylimidazole and N-ethylimidazole. Preferred tertiary amines are those of the pyridine type, in particular pyridine and a-, 0- and y-picoline, more preferably a-picoline.<br>
Apart from sulfur trioxide itself, useful sulfur trioxide sources also include chlorosulfonic acids and the adducts of sulfur trioxide with the abovementioned tertiary amines. Among the adducts of sulfur trioxide with tertiary amines, preference is given to the adducts with picoline, pyridine, triethylamine and N,N-dimethyl-N-cyclohexylamine. These adducts can be prepared by adding sulfur trioxide or chlorosulfonic acid to a solution of the tertiary amine in a suitable solvent, preferably the solvent of the reaction. The addition is preferably effected in the range from -20 to +50°C and in particular in the range from -10 to +30°C.<br>
Further useful sulfur trioxide sources include the adducts of sulfur trioxide with secondary amides such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide, di-n-propylformamide, dimethylacetamide, diethylacetamide, N-methylacetanilide, N-methylpyrrolidone and 3-ethylpyrrolidone, the adducts with tetraalkylurea compounds such as tetramethylurea, tetraethylurea, tetrabutylurea and iimethylpropyleneurea, and also the adducts with electron-rich 3thers such as tetrahydrofuran or pyran, or the adducts with litriles such as acetonitrile or propionitrile. These adducts are prepared in a similar manner to the adducts of sulfur trioxide tfith tertiary amines. In step i), preference is given to sulfur trioxide or a sulfur trioxide adduct with an amine of the pyridine type, more preferably a sulfur trioxide adduct with x-picoline.<br>
According to the invention, at least equimolar amounts, preferably at least 1.1 mol and in particular at least 1.2 mol, Df SO3 or SO3 adduct (calculated as S03) are used per mole of amine Al in the reaction of the primary or secondary amine Al in step i). Advantageously, not more than 2.5 mol and in particular not more than 2 mol of sulfur trioxide or sulfur trioxide adducts will be used per mole of amine Al.<br>
The amount of tertiary amine A2 used in step i) is preferably at least 2 mol, and in particlar at least 2.5 mol, per mole of amine Al. Advantageously, the amount of tertiary amine A2 is not more than 6 mol and in particular not more than 5 mol per mole of amine Al. In the case that the SO3 source used is the adduct of SO3 with a tertiary amine, the amount of tertiary amine A2 introduced in this way is also taken into account in the molar ratios previously mentioned, i.e. the molar data previously specified relate in each case to the total amount of tertiary amine in step i).<br>
Customarily, the reaction in step i) is effected at temperatures in the range from -20°C to +100°C and preferably in the range from -10 to +60°C. The procedure is generally that the sulfur trioxide or sulfur trioxide source is initially charged in a suitable solvent or diluent, and tertiary amine A2 is then added. The addition is generally effected in the range from -20 to +100°C, preferably in the range from -10 to +50°C and in particular in the range from -10 to +20°C. This reaction is frequently exothermic and is generally maintained within the desired temperature range by suitable measures of internal and/or external cooling. When the SO3 source used is an adduct of SO3 with a tertiary amine, the addition of the amine to the SO3 source is generally less exothermic. The amine Al is then added to the resulting solution or suspension. The amine Al may be added either undiluted or in dissolved or suspended form in a solvent or diluent suitable therefor. This results in the formation of the ammonium sulfamate shown in scheme 1. The amine Al is preferably added at<br>
temperatures in the range from -10 to +60°C. The reaction mixture obtained is frequently allowed to continue to react for some time after the addition, for example in the range from +10 to +80°C and in particular in the range from +20 to +60°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, step i) is carried out in such a way that the primary or secondary amine Al and the tertiary amine A2 are initially charged in a suitable solvent or diluent, and S03 or the S03 source is added thereto. S03 or the S03 source is likewise added in a suitable solvent or diluent. For the reaction temperatures, the same applies as was said above. Preference is given to adding at temperatures in the range from -20 to +80°C and in particular in the range from -10 to +60°C. After the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to continue to react for some time. In this time, the reaction temperatures are generally from +10 to +80°C and preferably from +20 to +60°C.<br>
The time necessary for the reaction in step i) is generally at least 15 minutes and will preferably not exceed 10 hours and in particular 5 hours.<br>
The rate at which the tertiary amine is added to the S03 or S03 source in the first embodiment is of minor importance for the result of the reaction, and the addition is generally effected in : a manner which allows temperature control by cooling. Depending on the size of the batch, the duration of the addition of the amine A2 is in the range from a few minutes to 1 hour. The rate of the addition of the amine Al to the reaction mixture obtained in this way is likewise of minor importance and is frequently in I the range from a few minutes up to 1 hour. To complete the reaction, the reaction is generally allowed to continue for a few minutes to a few hours, for example from 5 min to 3 h. However, reaction times of more than one hour are frequently unnecessary. In principle, it is possible to isolate that ammonium sulfamate &gt; obtained in step i) and then to react it in step ii) with at least the amount of a phosphorus halide required by the stoichiometry. However, preference is given to carrying out the reaction in step ii) without previously isolating the ammonium sulfamate from the reaction mixture obtained in step i), i.e. the ) phosphorus halide is added directly to the reaction mixture obtained in step i).<br>
Suitable phosphorus halides are the customary commercially obtainable phosphorus halides, in particular the chlorides and 5 the bromides, and more preferably the chlorides. Examples of suitable phosphorus halides include phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus <br>
tribromide and phosphorus pentabromide. Preference is given to phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride and in particular to phosphorus oxychloride (= phosphoryl chloride).<br>
The phosphorus halide may be added either undiluted or in an inert solvent or diluent. In the case of liquid phosphorus halides such as phosphoryl chloride, it is generally unnecessary to dissolve or dilute.<br>
The minimum amount of phosphorus halide required depends in a manner known per se on the stoichiometry of the reaction and, in the case of phosphorus pentachloride, is at least 0.5 mol per mole of amine Al and, in the case of phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide and phosphorus oxychloride, at least 1 mol per mole of amine Al. Advantageously, the amount of phosphorus halide will not exceed 3 mol per mole of amine Al and preferably 2.2 mol per mole of amine Al. When phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus tribromide or phosphorus oxychloride is used, the amount of phosphorus halide is preferably from 1 to 3 mol and in particular from 1.1 to 2.2 mol per mole of amine Al. When phosphorus pentachloride or phosphorus pentabromide is used, the amount is preferably from 0.5 to 1 mol, in particular from 0.6 to 0.9 mol, per mole of amine Al.<br>
i The reacton time required for step ii) is generally in the range from 0.5 to 8 hours.<br>
The reaction temperatures required for step ii) are generally in the range from 0 to 100°C, preferably in the range from 10 to 80°C ) and in particular in the range from 20 to 80°C.<br>
Suitable solvents or diluents for steps i) and ii) are those which are inert under the reaction conditions, i.e. toward SO3 and phosphorus halides. Such solvents are known to those skilled in &gt; the art and include both polar and nonpolar aprotic compounds such as cyclic or open-chain ethers, halohydrocarbons, nitrohydrocarbons, aromatic, aliphatic and cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, tetraalkylureas, N-alkyllactams, N,N-dialkylamides and their mixtures. Examples of ethers include diethyl ether, } di-n-propyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether. In addition to nitromethane, examples of nitrohydrocarbons include nitrobenzene, o-, m- or p-chloronitrobenzenes, and o-, p-nitrotoluenes. Examples of hydrocarbons include benzene, toluene, xylenes, hexane, heptane, 5 octane and cyclohexane. An example of tetraalkylureas is tetramethylurea. Examples of N,N-dialkylamides include dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide. An example of<br>
N-alkyllactams is N-methylpyrrolidone. Examples of halohydrocarbons include aliphatic halohydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, 1,1- and 1,2-dichloroethane, cis-l,2-dichloroethene, 1,1-, 1,2- and 1,3-dichloropropane, 1,4-dichlorobutane, tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1- and 1,1,2-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, pentachloroethane, trichlorofluoromethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, chlorotoluenes, dichlorotoluenes, trichlorobenzene and their mixtures. Preferred solvents include halohydrocarbons, in particular dichloroethane, dichloromethane and chlorobenzene, and also their mixtures. Useful diluents are in principle also the aforementioned tertiary amines.<br>
The amount of diluent is generally selected in such a way that the reaction mixtures remain flowable during the reaction, and the amount sufficient for this purpose is generally at least 500 ml, preferably at least 1 1, of solvent per mole of amine Al. These data relate to the total amount of solvent in reaction steps i) and ii). It will be appreciated that, for reasons of cost, the minimum amounts of solvent will be used. In general, the amount of solvent will therefore not be more than 5 1 per mole of amine Al.<br>
Process steps i) and ii) may be operated either batchwise or continuously in reaction vessels suitable therefor. In the batchwise method, stirred tanks and stirred reactors will customarily be used. These are generally equipped with suitable heat exchangers or a cooling jacket for removing the heat of reaction. The continuous performance of the reaction steps i) and • ii) is likewise effected in the reactors customary therefor, for example in stirred tanks, stirred tank batteries and tubular reactors, although preference is given to reactors having low backmixing.<br>
particular diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether and methyl tert-butyl ether. In this way, a solution of the sulfamoyl halide is obtained.<br>
After evaporating the solvent, the sulfamoyl halide is generally obtained in sufficient purity to allow its direct use in the preparation of crop protection agents, without requiring further purification stages. The purities achieved without distillation are frequently around 90% and in particular around 95% and above. For this reason, the process according to the invention may advantageously dispense with a distillation. However, it will be appreciated that a distillation is possible in principle.<br>
The process according to the invention delivers the sulfamoyl i halides in very good yields of generally at least 80% and frequently at least 90%, based on the amine Al.<br>
In addition, the process according to the invention does not entail the detour via carbamic acids or isocyanates and also I circumvents the problematic use of chlorine and the preparation of chloroamines.<br>
The process according to the invention makes it possible in principle to prepare any desired sulfamoyl halides which are &gt; derived from primary or secondary amines. It is also possible to use those amines which have comparatively reactive functionalities, in particular C=C double bonds, C=C triple bonds, aldehyde or keto carbonyl groups, ether groups, ester groups, amide groups and the like. Such sulfamoyl halides are ) novel and likewise form part of the subject-matter of the present invention. In particular, the present invention relates to sulfamoyl halides of the formula II<br>

The sulfamoyl halides obtained by the process according to the invention may be converted to the corresponding sulfamoyl amides (= sulfuric diamides) in analogy to existing methods by reaction with ammonia. The reaction affords the compounds in high yields. Such sulfamoyl amides have hitherto been prepared by reaction of by partially hydrolyzing chlorosulfonyl isocyanate to chlorosulfonamide CI-SO2-NH2 and subsequently reacting the chlorosulfonamide with a primary or secondary amine (see, for example, WO 00/83459). However, the sulfamoyl amides are obtainable by this route only in moderate yields of generally 
According to the invention, the sulfuric diamides are prepared by:<br>
i)	reacting a primary or secondary amine Al with at least equimolar amounts of SO3 or an SO3 source in the presence of at least equimolar amounts of a tertiary amine A2, based in each case on the amine Al, and<br>
ii)	reacting the reaction mixture obtained in step i) with at least the amount of a phosphorus halide required by the stoichiometry and<br>
iii)	reacting	the sulfamoyl halide obtained in step ii) with ammonia.<br>
The process according to the invention for preparing the sulfuric diamides affords the appropriate sulfuric diamides in very high yields and therefore likewise forms part of the subject matter of<br>
the present invention. The use of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in this process is unnecessary.<br>
The sulfuric diamides obtainable by this route, in particular those of the general formula III<br>
NH2-S02-NR1R2	(HI)<br>
where R1 and R2 are as defined above, are suitable for preparing compounds of the general formula IV<br><br>
as described in WO 01/83459. In formula IV, n is 0 or 1, Het is an optionally substituted 5- or 6-membered heterocycle which may have 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, optionally one further heteroatom selected from oxygen and sulfur, and optionally one or two carbonyl or thiocarbonyl groups as ring members. Ra is hydrogen, fluorine or chlorine, Rb is chlorine or cyano, and A is a radical derived from a primary or secondary amine Al, in particular is NHR3 or NRXR2 where R1 and R2 are each as previously defined and R3 has the same definition as R1.<br>
The present invention therefore also relates to a process for preparing compounds of the general formula II. This process comprises the following steps:<br>
i)	reacting a primary or secondary amine Al with at least equimolar amounts of SO3 or an SO3 source in the presence of at least equimolar amounts of a tertiary amine A2, based in each case on the amine Al, to obtain an ammonium sulfamate;<br>
ii)	reacting the ammonium sulfamate with at least the amount of a phosphorus halide required by the stoichiometry, to obtain a sulfamoyl halide of the amine Al;<br>
iii)	reacting	the sulfamoyl halide obtained in step ii) with ammonia to obtain a sulfamoyl amide; and <br>
iv)	reacting the reaction product from step iii) with a compound of the general formula V where Het, n, Ra and Rb are each as defined for formula IV and Y is OH, alkoxy or a halogen atom.<br>
Examples of suitable heterocycles are the radicals of the formulae Q1 to Q40 disclosed in WO 01/83459, which are incorporated herein by way of reference. Het(=N)n- preferably represents radicals of the formulae Q5, Q7, Q12, Q13, Q21, Q22, Q27, Q32, Q36, Q38, Q39, and Q40 disclosed in WO 01/83459, for example optionally substituted pyrimidine-2,6-dion-l-yl such as<br>
4-	trifluoromethylpyrimidine-2,6-dion-1-y1, 3-methyl-4-trifluoromethylpyrimidine-2,6-dion-l-yl or 3-amino-4-trifluoromethylpyrimidine-2,6-dion-l-yl, optionally substituted l,2,4-triazol-5-on-l-yl such as<br>

where X1, X2 and Z are each independently oxygen or sulfur, and in particular a radical of the general formula<br>
when n = 0.<br>
With regard to steps i) and ii), the same applies as was said above. Step iii) is generally carried out by reacting the sulfamoyl halide, preferably the chloride, with NH3 or an aqueous ammonia solution in a suitable solvent or diluent. In addition to the abovementioned solvents, suitable solvents or diluents are in particular water and water-miscible solvents and diluents. Preference is given to effecting the reaction in aqueous ammonia, in particular in from 5 to 35% by weight aqueous ammonia.<br>
Preferably, the procedure is to add the sulfamoyl halide, optionally diluted in an inert solvent, to the solution of the NH3 in a solvent, preferably to an aqueous ammonia solution. It will be appreciated that the sulfamoyl halide may also be initially charged, preferably in a solvent or diluent, and gaseous NH3 or a solution of NH3 in a solvent, in particular aqueous ammonia, may be added thereto. Preference is given to using NH3 in excess, based on the stoichiometry of the reaction. In particular, at least 2.5 mol of NH3, e.g. from 2.5 to 50 mol of NH3, in particular from 3 to 20 mol of NH3, will be used per mole of sulfamoyl halide.<br>
The temperatures required for the reaction are generally in the range from -20 to 100°C and preferably in the range from -10 to 30°C. The reaction time is generally in the range from 10 min to 5 h and preferably in the range from 0.5 h to 3 h. The sulfamoyl amide obtained in the reaction is worked up in a manner known per se, for example by removing the solvents and separating from the salts formed in the reaction.<br>
The step iv) in turn is effected in a manner known per se, for example as described in WO 01/83459, pp. 31-35, by reacting the compound of the formula V with the amounts required by the stoichiometry of the sulfamoyl amide obtained in stage iii) from the corresponding sulfamoyl chloride.<br>
When Y is OH, the reaction is effected, for example, in the presence of dehydrating agents such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in an inert organic solvent, and the reaction is optionally carried out in the presence of a tertiary<br>
amine or an amidine base such as DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo- [5.4.0]undec-7-ene or DBN (l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene) to accelerate the reaction. Alternatively, compounds V where Y = OH may also initially be converted into their acid halides and then reacted with the sulfamoyl amide. Such reactions are known to those skilled in the art, for example from Houben Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. E5 (1985), section I, p. 587 ff. and Vol. E5 (1985), section II, p. 934 ff. For further details, reference is also made at this point to WO 01/83459.<br>
