   ORIGINAL<br>
1375/MUM/2004<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an insecticidal composition and a process of preparation thereof.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a non-synthetic liquid insecticidal composition.<br>
This invention further relates to a broad-spectrum insecticidal composition for agricultural, horticultural and domestic applications, which can be sprayed over water and other similar bodies to prevent formation and propagation of insects, particularly flying insects.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insects are known to cause extensive damage to mankind, animals and plants.<br>
There are well over 1 million different known species of insects in the world and it is estimated that there might be as many as 10 million.<br>
Insects attack grains, vegetables and fruits in the fields as well as food that are stored in godowns and houses. Some species are known to eat houses made of wood, wooden furniture, carpets, and clothing.<br>
Many insects transmit viruses, fungi, and other disease causing pathogens to plants, animals and human beings.<br>
In case of agricultural crops, protecting the crop from insects and pathogens is a major concern so as to achieve higher yields.<br>
Crop protection translates to healthy and productive plants.<br>
2.<br><br>
Insects damage plants in several ways. The most visible damage is chewed plant leaves and flowers. Many pests are visible and can be readily identified, including the Japanese beetle, Colorado potato beetle, and numerous species of caterpillars such as tent caterpillars and tomato hornworms.<br>
Other chewing insects, however, such as cutworms come out at night to eat, and burrow into the soil during the day.<br>
Sucking insects are extremely common and can be very damaging. These insects insert their mouthparts into the plant tissues and suck out the plant juices. They also may carry diseases that they spread from plant to plant as they move about.<br>
Other insects cause damage by boring into stems, fruits, and leaves. They may disrupt the plant"s ability to transport water. They also create opportunities for disease organisms to attack the plants. Common examples of boring insects include squash vine borers and corn borers.<br>
As far as human beings and animals are concerned, insects and other arthropods can cause injury and even death by their bites or stings. Many insects transmit bacteria and other disease causing pathogens.<br>
Insects such as mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting several diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and viral encephalitis and the like.<br>
Apart from causing extreme physical discomfort and mental agony they cause severe loss in terms of productive time, money and other resources.<br>
Insects such as mosquitoes breed in any stagnant body of water including, tree-holes, containers used to store water and larger bodies of water such as lakes and marshes. The stagnant bodies of water act as breeding grounds for the mosquitoes.<br>
3<br><br>
To protect human beings, traditionally several practices have been used to reduce insect aggravation such as smoky fires or spreading mud and dust over the body to repel biting and tickling insects.<br>
But these crude methods often result in skin irritations such as rashes and other symptoms such as burning, itching, allergy and the like<br>
To overcome these problems several chemical and other insecticides were developed which could offer protection from insects without coming in contact with the human body. These chemical insecticides are effective in killing the insects and containing their life cycles. The use of chemical insecticides for controlling the birth, reproduction of insects such as mosquitoes and others is very common and widely used.<br>
Chemical insecticides such as DDT (also known as dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane), DEET (also known as N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), Aldrin and Endrin and the like are commonly used insecticides. But long and perpetual use of these insecticides is known to cause damage to the human body.<br>
Several chemical insecticides make use of allethrin, which apart from containing the insects can also harm the eyes, skin, the respiratory tract, and the nervous system of human beings. Long-term and persistent use of products containing allethrin could even cause brain cancer, blood cancer, and deformity of fetus.<br>
Chemical insecticides also have other disadvantages.<br>
They cause increased environmental pollution.<br>
The chemical insecticides used to control insect pests may also directly or indirectly harm other components of the ecosystem such as birds, animals, and other useful life forms.<br>
4<br><br>
In addition insects tend to be become immune to the effect of chemicals over a period of time. Vector resistance to insecticides is the most outstanding technical problem impeding the development of vector control programs.<br>
Many of the chemical insecticides and pesticides cause pest resurgence, which means there is a rapid reappearance of a pest population in injurious numbers, brought about after the application of a broad-spectrum insecticide/ pesticide. The insecticide/ pesticide kills the natural enemies of the targeted insects and pests which otherwise keep a check on the insect-pests.<br>
Because of these drawbacks herbal insecticidal alternatives are becoming increasingly popular and in demand. The herbal preparations have the advantage of providing protection from insects without causing damage to the environment and human beings. They also do not cause pest resurgence or resistance. They also do not cause mutations in the insect species which at times give rise to newer more dangerous variations of the existing insect pests.<br>
The use of herbs for protection against insects and in the treatment of insect bites is an age-old concept. The use of herb-based insecticides is well known and has been discussed in depth in ancient Indian scriptures of Ayurveda such as Charak Samhita and Susruta Samhita etc.<br>
These herbal insecticidal compositions can be formulated in various ways and released / used in ways such as sprays, baits, slow-release diffusion, coils etc.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Several herb based insecticidal compositions have also been disclosed in prior art:<br>
5<br><br>
US Patent No. 5,372,817 (no Indian equivalent application available) discloses an insecticidal composition derived from neem oil and neem wax fractions. The insecticidal composition is obtained using a non-polar, hydrophobic solvent. Neem seed extracts, which are substantially free of azadirachtin, are obtained by concentrating the hydrophobic solvent extract and cooling the resulting neem oil to separate a semi-solid neem wax fraction and a clarified neem oil fraction.<br>
US Patent No. 5,405,612 (no Indian equivalent application available) discloses an insecticide derived from a neem seed extract comprising neem oil, which is substantially free of azadirachtin. The said neem oil being prepared by extracting dried, coarsely ground neem seeds with a non-polar, hydrophobic solvent.<br>
CN1104852A (no Indian equivalent application available) describes an insect preventive composition, composed of 6 traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. The constituents are-lemongrass 10-15%, Eugenia caryophyllata 10-15%, L. foenumgraecum 40-50%, pine needle 5-10%, flue-cured tobacco 5-10% and perpermint 5-10%. The above-mentioned medicinal herbs are ground into a powder. To the powder mixture the solution of carboxy methyl cellulose is sprayed uniformly and stirred thoroughly. The invention is safe, non¬toxic, does not contaminate clothing and other articles of daily use and environment. The insecticide has a wide range of applications, and is capable of effectively preventing moth or any other insect that eat books, clothes etc. and mildew.<br>
Indian Patent IN0187100 reveals a process for the preparation of insecticidal formulation of neem seed kernel extract.<br>
All the above inventions described in the prior art either describe the use of an individual herbal ingredient or a mixture of ingredients, which have only specific applications. These herbal insecticides have limited application and cannot be effectively sprayed on water.<br>
The need was felt for long acting potent, long acting insecticidal composition that had broad-spectrum activity against most insects.<br>
6<br><br>
The need was felt similarly for an insecticidal composition which was safe on human beings and animals in a sense that it does not cause any side effects and does not accumulate in the human system.<br>
The need was also felt for an insecticidal composition, which was cheap and easy to prepare, and which could advantageously be sprayed over water too.<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
EXAMPLE-1:<br>
Healthy, fresh, intact, clean leaves of<br>
Eucalyptus globulus<br>
Azadirachta indica<br>
Vitex Negundo<br>
Ocimum Sanctum<br>
and healthy, fresh, intact, clean fruits of Hydnocarpus laurifolia were diligently cleaned<br>
with fresh demineralized water to remove adhering dirt particles and other impurities.<br>
Following this each of the herbal ingredients were separately dried in shade for just enough<br>
time to remove water adhering to the surface of the leaves and fruits, periodically shuffling<br>
the leaves and fruits to ensure even drying.<br>
15<br><br>
Following this, the leaves and the fruits of the present insecticidal composition were individually ground to a fine paste using a mortar and pestle using just enough water to obtain a paste like consistency and filtered through a fresh clean moist muslin cloth to obtain the juice, which were collected in separate containers.<br>
Subsequently the fresh juices of all the five herbal ingredients were intimately mixed using a wooden spatula in the following proportion to prepare 1000 ml of a final sprayable insecticidal composition:<br>
Eucalyptus globulus - leaf juice	50ml<br>
Azadirachta indica - leaf juice	500ml<br>
Vitex Negundo -   leaf juice	250ml<br>
Ocimum Sanctum - leaf juice	100ml.<br>
and<br>
Hydnocarpus laurifolia -fruit juice	100ml<br>
This was followed by filling the juices obtained as described above up to the brim of bottles amber colored glass bottles of 200 ml capacity each allowing the insecticidal composition to overflow and sealing with air tight plastic screw caps. This was to ensure that there was no air in the bottle and the process of oxidative degradation was minimized.<br>
The insecticide so prepared was tested against fleas in a flea infested garbage bin and was found to be very effective.<br>
Stability testing:<br>
Three months:<br>
The insecticide so prepared was tested for stability by storing the tightly capped containers in a cool dry, shady place for a period of three months from the date of preparation and was tested subsequently on the same flea infested garbage bin where the initial testing was done. It was found to be as effective as the fresh preparation without any deterioration or loss of potency.<br>
16<br><br>
Six months:<br>
The insecticide so prepared was tested for stability by storing the tightly capped containers in a cool dry, shady place for a period of nine months from the date of preparation and was tested subsequently on the same flea infested garbage bin where both the previous testing were carried out. It was found to be as effective as the fresh preparation without any deterioration or loss of potency.<br>
Safety testing:<br>
1)	The fresh insecticidal preparation was applied on a 1cm * 1cm patch on the back of two caged healthy disease free white mice, once a day for one week. Neither of the mice developed any allergic skin or other reaction at the end of the one-week trial period.<br>
2)	Following the trial above a similar test was done on the inner fore arm of healthy, disease free volunteers (one male and one female) by applying the preparation on a 1cm * lcm patch once a day for one week. Again the preparation did not trigger any allergic skin or other reaction at the end of the one-week trial period.<br>
EXAMPLE-2:<br>
The juice from the leaves and the fruits of the same herbs described in example-1 were<br>
extracted in the same manner as described in the same example.<br>
But since the juices could not be mixed immediately they were each filled to the brim in different amber colored plastic containers, sealed after allowing the composition to slightly overflow and sealed in an air tight fashion. The compositions were then stored in a cool dry place for twenty-four hours following which they were processed as described below.<br>
The juices of the leaves of the four herbs and the fruit were intimately mixed with a stainless steel spatula in the following proportion to prepare 1000ml of a final sprayable insecticidal composition:<br>

5. TARGETED INSECT: MOSQUITOES<br>
SPRAY RATE: 104 ml /min (3.5 oz/min)<br>
COMPOSITION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION USED FOR THE STUDY: Polyherbal composition prepared as described in example-5.<br>
STUDY METHODOLOGY: An open drain with a width of one meter and measuring to a length of 500 meters was selected for the study. The selected patch was sprayed with the composition of the present invention.<br>
The population of the insect vectors in each patch was about 500 per square meter.<br>
The time chosen to spray the insecticidal compositions was dusk (As this is the time the<br>
mosquitoes were found to be most active)<br>
The insecticide was sprayed 5 times with a gap of 15 days between two consecutive spray<br>
cycles.<br>
A fogging unit was used to apply the insecticides using ULV (ultra low volume) spray units<br>
to dispense very fine aerosol droplets (fog) that kill mosquitoes on contact. The aerosol fog<br>
primarily targets flying mosquitoes, which is why the timing of the spray was critical.<br>
RESULT AND ANALYSIS:<br>
During the fogging, flying mosquitoes within the treated area were killed. Although the local mosquito population was reduced for a few days, fogging did not prevent mosquitoes from re-entering the area.<br>
The insecticide of the present invention was able to control the mosquito population for two months after 5 cycles of spraying. However the composition was not effective after that.<br>

In addition open bottles (previously filled with water and stored as such for two months) measuring (6 cm high * 7 cm diameter) each containing the mosquitoes larvae were placed on the wall inside one house in each of the two sectors.<br>
While one sector was sprayed with Cypermethrin, the other sector was sprayed with the insecticidal composition of the present invention.<br>
Both the insecticides were sprayed once a week only for a period of 30 minutes, covering the entire area.<br>
Each week following the spraying of insecticides the number of larvae in the bottle containers were counted and removed.<br>
29<br><br>
RESULT AND ANALYSIS:<br>
The pyrethroid- Cypermethrin was effective in controlling the adult and larval forms, but the composition of the present invention showed the same effect in two sprays as against three sprays as required for Cypermethrin. Also the insecticidal composition of the present invention caused no environmental pollution.<br>
11. TARGETED INSECT: FEMALE ANOPHELES MOSQUITOS<br>
INSECTICIDE TESTED AGAINST: Pyrethroid- Cyfluthrin 15g/l SPRAY RATE: 104 ml /min (3.5 oz/min)<br>
COMPOSITION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION USED FOR THE STUDY: Polyherbal composition prepared as described in example-4<br>
STUDY METHODOLOGY:<br>
A crowded housing estate in Mumbai comprising of two sectors with 400 houses each were<br>
chosen for the study. A pyrethroid namely Cyfluthrin 15g/l was diluted in diesel. A cold<br>
aerosol generator was used for spraying.<br>
The knockdown and mortality rate of caged female anopheles mosquitoes were used to<br>
evaluate the efficiency of the two insecticides.<br>
Cylindrical screened sentinel cages (26 cm long * 18 cm diameter) were filled with female<br>
anopheles mosquitoes. The cages were hung inside a well-ventilated room in a house of<br>
each of the sectors at a distance of two meters above the ground.<br>
In addition open bottles (previously filled with water and stored as such for two months)<br>
measuring (6 cm high * 7 cm diameter) each containing the mosquitoes larvae were placed<br>
on the wall inside one house of each of the two sectors.<br>
One of the sectors was sprayed with Cyfluthrin while the other was sprayed with the insecticidal composition of the present invention. Both the insecticides were sprayed once in 10 days for a period of 30 minutes, covering the entire area.<br>
After each round of spraying, on the next day following the spraying of insecticides the number of larvae in the bottle containers were counted and removed.<br>
30<br><br>
RESULT AND ANALYSIS:<br>
The pyrethroid- Cyfluthrin was effective in controlling the adult and larval forms, but the composition of the present invention had a mosquito inhibiting effect in 45 days as against 25 days required for Cyfluthrin. Also the insecticidal composition of the present invention caused no environmental pollution.<br>
12. TARGETED INSECT: MOSQUITOES<br>
INSECTICIDE TESTED AGAINST: DDT<br>
SPRAY RATE: 104 ml /min (3.5 oz/min)<br>
COMPOSITION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION USED FOR THE STUDY: Polyherbal<br>
composition prepared as described in example-5<br>
STUDY METHODOLOGY:<br>
Two open drains, with a width of one meter and measuring to a length of 500 meters were selected for the study. Both the drains were at a distance of 500 meters within each other. The distance being selected in such a manner so that the first test patch sprayed with the chemical DDT does not interfere with the results obtained in the second patch, which was sprayed with the composition of the present invention.<br>
The populations of the insect vectors in each patch were about 500 per square meter.<br>
The time chosen to spray the insecticidal compositions was dusk (as this is the time the<br>
mosquitoes were found to be most active)<br>
One drain was sprayed with DDT while the other was sprayed with the insecticidal composition of the present invention. Each insecticide was sprayed 5 times with a gap of 15 days between two consecutive spray cycles.<br>
Fogging units were used to apply the insecticides using ULV (ultra low volume) spray units to dispense very fine aerosol droplets (fog) that stay aloft and kill mosquitoes on contact. The aerosol fog primarily targets flying mosquitoes, which is why the timing of the spray was critical.<br>
31<br><br>
The amount of insecticide sprayed was about 3 to 5 ounces for each area under test.<br>
During fogging, flying mosquitoes within the treated area were killed. Although the local mosquito population is reduced for a few days, fogging does not prevent mosquitoes from re-entering the area.<br>
RESULT AND ANALYSIS:<br>
While DDT was able to control the mosquito population up to 30 days after the three<br>
cycles, the insecticide of the present invention<br>
was able to control the mosquito population for two months. However neither was effective<br>
after that.<br>
