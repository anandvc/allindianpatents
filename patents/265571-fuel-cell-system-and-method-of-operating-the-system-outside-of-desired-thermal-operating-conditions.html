				<td>FUEL CELL SYSTEM AND METHOD OF OPERATING THE SYSTEM<br>
OUTSIDE OF DESIRED THERMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a fuel cell system and, more<br>
particularly, to a method of operating a fuel cell system outside of desired<br>
thermal operating conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can<br>
be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. The automotive industry<br>
expends significant resources in the development of hydrogen fuel cells as a<br>
source of power for vehicles. Such vehicles would be more efficient and<br>
generate fewer emissions than todays vehicles employing internal<br>
combustion engines.<br>
[0003] A hydrogen fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that includes<br>
an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte disposed therebetween. The<br>
anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives oxygen or air. The<br>
hydrogen gas is disassociated in the anode to generate free hydrogen protons<br>
and electrons. The hydrogen protons pass through the electrolyte to the<br>
cathode. The hydrogen protons react with the oxygen and the electrons in the<br>
cathode to generate water. The electrons from the anode cannot pass<br>
through the electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load to perform work<br>
before being sent to the cathode. The work acts to operate the vehicle.<br>
[0004] Many fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack to<br>
generate the desired power for the vehicle. The fuel cell stack receives a<br>
cathode input gas as a flow of air typically forced through the stack by a<br>
compressor. Not all of the oxygen in the air is consumed by the stack, and<br>
some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include water as<br>
a stack by-product.<br>
[0005] The components of the fuel cell system in the vehicle, such as<br>
a compressor motor and a compressor motor power inverter module,<br>
generate heat during operation of the fuel cell system. The heat energy must<br><br>
be removed from the fuel cell system to keep the internal temperatures of the<br>
components and fuel cell system within desired operating conditions to<br>
militate against damage to the components. Heat energy is typically removed<br>
from the fuel cell system by a coolant caused to flow through the fuel cell<br>
system by a recirculation pump. If the recirculation pump fails or the coolant<br>
leaks from the fuel cell system, the fuel cell system may overheat, shutdown,<br>
and cause the components to perform below an optimal level. Further, if the<br>
fuel cell system is shutdown or damaged, an operator of the vehicle<br>
incorporating the fuel cell system may not be able to operate the vehicle,<br>
resulting in a walk home incident<br>
[0006] It would be desirable to provide a method for operating a fuel<br>
cell system when the fuel cell system is operating outside of desired thermal<br>
operating conditions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] Concordant and congruous with the present invention, a<br>
method for operating a fuel cell system when the fuel cell system is operating<br>
outside of desired thermal operating conditions, has surprisingly been<br>
discovered.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, the fuel cell system comprises a fuel cell<br>
stack including at least a cathode inlet and a cathode outlet, wherein a fluid is<br>
caused to flow through the cathode inlet and the cathode outlet of said fuel<br>
cell stack; a compressor in fluid communication with said fuel cell stack; a first<br>
thermal sensor in communication with said compressor, said first thermal<br>
sensor adapted to generate a sensor signal indicative of a temperature of said<br>
compressor; and a control system adapted to receive the sensor signal from<br>
said first thermal sensor and cause a change in operation of said compressor<br>
to minimize an amount of heat generated by said compressor.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, the fuel cell system comprises a fuel<br>
cell stack including at least a cathode inlet and a cathode outlet, wherein a<br>
fluid is caused to flow through the cathode inlet and the cathode outlet of said<br>
fuel cell stack; a compressor inducing a compressor power inverter and in<br>
fluid communication with said fuel cell stack; a first thermal sensor in<br><br>
communication with said compressor, said first thermal sensor adapted to<br>
generate a sensor signal indicative of a temperature of one of said<br>
compressor and the compressor power inverter; and a control system<br>
adapted to receive the sensor signal from said first thermal sensor and cause<br>
a change in operation of said compressor to minimize an amount of heat<br>
generated by said compressor.<br>
[0010] In another embodiment, the method of operating a fuel cell<br>
system comprises the steps of: providing a fuel cell stack including at least a<br>
cathode inlet and a cathode outlet; providing a compressor in fluid<br>
communication with the fuel cell stack; providing a first thermal sensor in fluid<br>
communication with the compressor, the sensor adapted to generate a sensor<br>
signal indicative of a temperature of the compressor; providing a control<br>
system adapted to receive the sensor signal from the first thermal sensor;<br>
causing a fluid comprising oxygen to flow through the compressor of the fuel<br>
cell system, wherein the sensor signal is indicative of a temperature of the<br>
compressor; and adjusting the operation of the compressor with the control<br>
system based on the sensor signal to minimize an amount of heat generated<br>
by the compressor.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] The above, as well as other advantages of the present invention,<br>
will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description of a preferred embodiment when considered in the light of the<br>
accompanying drawing in which a schematic flow diagram of a fuel cell system<br>
is shown according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012] The following detailed description and appended drawings<br>
describe and illustrate various exemplary embodiments of the invention. The<br>
description and drawings serve to enable one skilled in the art to make and<br>
use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in<br>
any manner. In respect of the methods disclosed, the steps presented are<br><br>
exemplary in nature, and thus, the order of the steps is not necessary or<br>
critical.<br>
[0013] The drawing shows a fuel cell system 10 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The fuel cell system 10 includes a compressor<br>
12 in fluid communication with a fuel cell stack 14.<br>
[0014] In the embodiment: shown, the compressor 12 is a centrifugal<br>
air compressor including a compressor motor power inverter 18. An inlet 12a<br>
of the compressor 12 is in fluid communication with an oxygen source 20<br>
through a conduit 38. An outlet 12b of the compressor 12 is in fluid<br>
communication with an inlet 22a of a heat exchanger 22. The compressor 12<br>
may be any conventional means for compressing a fluid such as a<br>
turbomachine, a centrifugal compressor, a mixed flow compressor, a blower<br>
or a fan, for example. The oxygen source 20 is typically a source of air. It is<br>
understood that the oxygen source 20 may be a fuel tank or the atmosphere,<br>
for example.<br>
[0015] An outlet 22b of the heat exchanger 22 is in fluid<br>
communication with a first inlet 24a of a humidifier 24. In the embodiment<br>
shown, the heat exchanger 22 is a low-temperature core. It is understood that<br>
any conventional heat exchanger may be used such as a shell and tube heat<br>
exchanger, a plate heat exchanger, an air-cooled heat exchanger, or other<br>
heat exchanger known in the art.<br>
[0016] The humidifier 24 is a water vapor transfer unit adapted to<br>
humidify an oxidant such as air prior to entering into the fuel cell stack 14. The<br>
water vapor transfer unit includes a dry side and a wet side separated by a<br>
water vapor permeable membrane (not shown) or the like. The dry side has<br>
the first inlet 24a and a first outlet 24b, and the wet side has a second inlet<br>
24c and a second outlet 24d. The first outlet 24b is in fluid communication<br>
with a cathode inlet 14a of the fuel cell stack 14. The second inlet 24c is in<br>
fluid communication with a cathode outlet 14b of the fuel cell stack 14, and the<br>
second outlet 24d is in fluid communication with an exhaust system 30 that is<br>
in fluid communication with the atmosphere.<br>
[0017] The fuel cell stack 14 includes a stack of cathodes, anodes,<br>
and membranes (fuel cells), as previously discussed herein. It is understood<br><br>
that the number of fuel cells in the fuel cell stack 14 may vary. Each fuel cell<br>
of the fuel cell stack 14 has a pair of MEAs (not shown) separated by an<br>
electrically conductive bipolar plate (not shown). The MEAs and bipolar plates<br>
are stacked together between clamping plates or end plates (not shown) and<br>
end contact elements (not shown). The end contact elements and bipolar<br>
plates contain a plurality of grooves or channels for distributing fuel and<br>
oxidant gases (i.e. hydrogen and oxygen) to the MEAs.<br>
[0018] The fuel cell stack 14 further includes the cathode inlet 14a, the<br>
cathode outlet 14b, an anode inlet 14c, an anode outlet 14d, and an anode<br>
purge outlet 14e. The anode inlet 14c is in fluid communication with a<br>
hydrogen source 28. The anode outlet 14d is in fluid communication with the<br>
second inlet 24c of the humidifier 24. The anode purge outlet 14e is in fluid<br>
communication with another exhaust system 30 which is in fluid<br>
communication with the atmosphere. The number of inlets and outlets in the<br>
fuel cell stack 14 may vary based on the size of the stack in use, an amount of<br>
outlet energy required from the stack 14, and other design considerations. It is<br>
understood that the hydrogen source 28 may be a fuel tank or other system<br>
component, for example. It is also understood that the anode outlet 14b may<br>
be in fluid communication with the atmosphere, another fuel cell stack (not<br>
shown), or other system component, as desired.<br>
[0019] In the embodiment shown, the fuel cell system 10 includes a first<br>
thermal sensor 32 in communication with the compressor 12 and the<br>
compressor motor power inverter 18. A second thermal sensor 34 is in<br>
communication with the first outlet 24b of the humidifier 24. The first thermal<br>
sensor 32 is adapted to provide a signal indicative of the temperature of the<br>
compressor 12 and the compressor motor power inverter 18. The second<br>
thermal sensor 34 is adapted to provide a signal indicative of the temperature of<br>
the fluid caused to flow from the humidifier 24 to the fuel cell stack 14. The first<br>
thermal sensor 32 and second thermal sensor 34 are in electrical<br>
communication with a control system 36. It is understood that the thermal<br>
sensors 32, 34 may be any conventional thermal sensor known in the art. It is<br>
also understood that the fuel cell system 10 may include additional thermal<br><br>
sensors in communication with the heat exchanger 22, a fuel cell system<br>
pump, the humidifier 24, and other system components, as desired.<br>
[0020] In use, the air including oxygen is caused to flow from the<br>
oxygen source 20 and through the fuel cell system 10. The air is caused to<br>
flow through conduit 38 to the inlet 12a of the compressor 12. In the<br>
compressor 12, the volume of the air is reduced, thereby increasing the<br>
pressure and the temperature thereof. The air is then caused to flow through the<br>
conduit 38 to the inlet 22a of the heat exchanger 22. In the heat exchanger 22,<br>
the air is cooled to a desired temperature. The air from the outlet 22b of the heat<br>
exchanger 22 flows through the conduit 38 to the first inlet 24a of the humidifier<br>
24 and through the dry side of the humidifier 24. In the humidifier 24, a fluid such<br>
as air having a higher moisture content than the air flowing through the dry side<br>
is caused to flow through the wet side. Moisture is transferred through the<br>
membrane to the air flowing through the dry side. The fluid in the wet side is<br>
caused to flow through the second outlet 24d of the humidifier 24, through the<br>
exhaust system 30, and to the atmosphere. The air in the dry side is caused to<br>
flow through the first outlet 24b to the cathode inlet 14a of the fuel cell stack 14.<br>
[0021] Simultaneous to the air being caused to flow to the stack 14,<br>
hydrogen gas is caused to flow from the hydrogen source 28 to the anode<br>
inlet 14c of the fuel cell stack 14. In the fuel cell stack 14, the oxygen in the air<br>
electrochemically reacts with the hydrogen to generate power to drive a<br>
vehicle or other system as is known in the art. A portion of unreacted<br>
hydrogen may be caused to flow out of the fuel cell stack 14 through the<br>
anode outlet 14d, and through the conduit 38 to the second inlet 24c of the<br>
humidifier 24. Another portion of unreacted hydrogen may be caused to flow<br>
out of the fuel cell stack 14 through the anode purge outlet 14e, through the<br>
conduit 38, through the exhaust system 30, and to the atmosphere.<br>
Unreacted oxygen is caused to flow through the cathode outlet 14b, through<br>
the conduit 38, to the second inlet 24c of the humidifier 24.<br>
[0022] While the fuel cell system 10 is in operation, the compressor 12<br>
and the compressor motor power inverter 18 generate heat. If the temperature<br>
is outside a desired range due to the amount of heat generated, the first<br>
thermal sensor 32 sends a sensor signal to the control system 36. The control<br><br>
system 36 adjusts the operation of the compressor 12 and compressor motor<br>
power inverter 18. A maximum allowable compressor power based on the<br>
thermal sensor 32 signal is calculated by the control system 36. As the<br>
temperature in the fuel cell system 10 increases, the power generated by the<br>
compressor 12 and compressor motor power inverter 18 is minimized by the<br>
control system 36, thereby minimizing the heat generated by the compressor<br>
12 and compressor motor power inverter 18. To minimize the power<br>
generated by the compressor 12 and the compressor motor power inverter<br>
18, the rotational speed of the compressor 18 is minimized, thereby causing a<br>
reduction in the flow of fluid through the compressor 12. A reduction in the<br>
flow of fluid also minimizes the current produced by the fuel cell stack 14 and<br>
the power output of the fuel cell system 10. The power reduction of the<br>
compressor 12 and compressor motor power inverter 18 is typically gradual,<br>
continuous, and proportional to the temperature state of the fuel cell system<br>
10. The fuel cell system 10 continues to operate at a minimized power output<br>
and reduced speed of the compressor 12, until the fuel cell system 10 is<br>
within the desired temperature range or until the fuel cell system 10 can be<br>
serviced.<br>
[0023] Additionally, if a coolant flowing through the fuel cell system 10<br>
leaks or if a coolant recirculation pump ceases operation, system components<br>
would generate heat and introduce the heat into the fuel cell system 10. If the<br>
temperature is outside a desired range due to the amount of heat generated,<br>
the first thermal sensor 32 sends a sensor signal to the control system 36.<br>
The control system 36 adjusts the operation of the compressor 12 and<br>
compressor motor power inverter 18. A maximum allowable compressor<br>
power based on the temperature sensor 32 signal is calculated by the control<br>
system 36. As the temperature in the fuel cell system 10 increases, the power<br>
generated by the compressor 12 and compressor motor power inverter 18 is<br>
minimized by the control system 36, thereby minimizing the heat generated by<br>
the compressor 12 and compressor motor power inverter 18. To minimize the<br>
power generated by the compressor 12 and the compressor motor power<br>
inverter 18, the rotational speed of the compressor 18 is minimize, thereby<br>
causing a reduction in the flow of fluid through the compressor 12. A reduction<br><br>
in the flow of fluid also minimizes the current produced by the fuel cell stack<br>
14 and the power output of the fuel cell system 10. The power reduction of the<br>
compressor 12 and compressor motor power inverter 18 is typically gradual,<br>
continuous, and proportional to tne temperature state of the fuel cell system<br>
10. The fuel cell system 10 continues to operate at a minimized power output<br>
and reduced speed of the compressor 12 until the fuel cell system 10 is within<br>
the desired temperature range or until the fuel cell system 10 can be serviced.<br>
It is understood that the control system 36 may also adjust the operation of<br>
the heat exchanger 22, the humidifier 24, or other system component to<br>
minimize the heat generated and introduced to the fuel cell system 10, as<br>
desired.<br>
