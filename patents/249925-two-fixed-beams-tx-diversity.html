				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD The   present   invention   relates   to   a   method   and   an   apparatus   for simultaneous transmitting diversity signals into a cell of a cellular system having narrow beams utilizing non-coherent signal paths.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Up to now cellular systems have base stations using omni-radiating antennas or antennas radiating in a sector (typically 120° coverage per sector). The antennas cover the whole cell and no knowledge of the position of the mobiles is used.<br>
To increase the coverage and capacity of future systems, large efforts have been put into development of transmit diversity (TX-div) schemes/systems using multiple antenna units. TX-div utilizes multiple signal source generation to be transmitted via more-or-less independent (non-correlated) propagation channels to the receiver. The aim is to improve the reception of the received total signal quality. This is commonly obtained through coherent combining of the several source signals.<br>
Different TX-div methods/schemes commonly put different hardware (HW) requirements on the radiated signals and their relative behavior. These requirements can usually be associated to the relative time, phase and/or amplitude of the radiated signals.<br>
Another method to create capacity/coverage increase in conventional cellular systems, is to use adaptive antenna arrays at the Radio Base Station (RBS).<br>
The narrow-beams created by beam forming in the adaptive antenna system can be used to increase the coverage by directivity and to reduce the interference in both the uplink and the downlink. Thus, the idea is to avoid distributed energy which no one can make use of, i.e. minimizing the interference   in   the   system.   In   the   cellular   systems   both   broadcast<br>
information (i.e. information addressed to all users in the coverage area) and dedicated information (i.e. information to a specific mobile terminal) are transmitted simultaneously from an RBS.<br>
Simultaneous transmission in several beams requires coherent signal paths from the creation of the signal up to the antenna, including feeder cable coherency or by additional signal and antenna hardware. The signal coherency may set a number of requirements on the implemented system hardware, not necessarily the same hardware requirements as for the TX-div.<br>
STATE OF THE ART Increasing the coverage and capacity through TX-div schemes involves multiple signal source generation transmitted via in principle non-correlated propagation channels to the receiver. To achieve this, multiple antenna units are used. The most common configuration to be proposed is a set-up having two identical antennas separated by a distance sufficiently large. The two antennas illuminate a coverage area, which in principle is the same for both antennas, see for instance Figure 1.<br>
Different methods can be used to support the identification and/or combination of the source signals, e.g. delay diversity, frequency diversity, polarization diversity, different identifier (code) for signal acquisition and combination, feedback correction (i.e. receiver measurements communicated back to the transceiver for correction of transmitted signals).<br>
In all common cellular systems (GSM, Global System for Mobile telecommunications; PDC Pacific Digital Cellular system; TDMA-IS136 Time Division Multiple Access; EDGE Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution; UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) the TX-div is proposed/used in the downlink, i.e. multiple source signals from the base station are transmitted towards the mobile receiver.<br>
For example in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Frequency Division Duplex (UMTS-FDD) (WCDMA, Wideband Code Division Multiple Access) there are several TX-div modes defined in the standard [1] as the open-loop Space Time Transmit Diversity (STTD), closed-loop model and mode2. The mentioned WCDMA TX-div modes above are regarding configurations and schemes utilizing two TX-div branches. In the future it may be standardized even schemes for higher order number of TX-div branches.<br>
In these schemes, there are rather strict requirements on the relative phase, amplitude and/or time accuracy between the signal paths in the TX-div transmission branches<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED To utilize the potential performance (capacity/coverage) advantages of multi-beam, especially for two fixed-beams as a TX-div solution, requires simultaneous transmission for both cell and narrow beam coverage. A number of issues that must be fulfilled for a cost-effective system have been identified:<br>
Less or equal amount of hardware resources should be required as for a conventional TX-div system with two sector coverage antennas. Specifically, for UMTS-FDD (WCDMA), there shall be no change of RBS (Node B) hardware configuration for TX-div, except antenna hardware and mounting. Requirements on components and/or subsystems must not be increased.<br>
In order not to introduce additional complexity it is required that no additional coherency requirements are introduced in the system. In general, due to vector addition of transmitted signals, simultaneous transmission in two beams requires coherent signal paths from the creation of signals up to the antenna, including feeder cable coherency. Otherwise  the  radiation pattern will  be uncontrolled and can have<br>
significant variations, including possible directions with nulls in the radiation pattern. Such coherent signal paths are very delicate to achieve in an installed product with several years of expected lifetime. That kind of solution will include calibration loops and control functions that are expensive to introduce in the system. The issue is to create the coherent antenna system behavior without requiring signal coherency.<br>
Capacity/Coverage: The solution must not limit the possibility to utilize the full potential of the Two Fixed-Beam TX Diversity system. The potential of such a system is expected to achieve better performance than a conventional TX-div system.<br>
No standardization changes are desired: One major requirement is that no interaction with the mobile/terminal is allowed outside the standard protocol. The solution should be transparent to the system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A novel solution is proposed minimizing the amount of hardware and hardware accuracy requirements, which simultaneously gives the feature of both cell and narrow-beams transmission, while enabling methods for capacity/coverage increase.<br>
The main property utilized by the present invention for maintaining cell-coverage pattern control, when radiating information in two simultaneous beams, is to use orthogonal polarization states for the two beams. The two orthogonal polarization states may for instance constitute linear polarization slanted at +45° and -45°, respectively.<br>
The dedicated beam transmission, broadcast transmission needs to be conveyed defining the total cell coverage area. The total cell coverage area is matched by the coverage of the two fixed narrow-beams. The broadcast<br>
signal transmission is divided into two signal streams/paths, one for each of the two fixed narrow-beams (no coherency requirements existing between the two parallel signal streams/paths). The two broadcast signal streams/paths are combined by means of combiner units with the dedicated combined signals from all fixed narrow-beam selected users in each of the two branches. The signals to the two antennas are then transmitted having an orthogonal polarization. An alternative solution is to combine dedicated user signals selected for transmission over the specific fixed narrow-beam together with an associated broadcast signal stream in the same combiner unit.<br>
A method according to the present inventive solution is set forth by the independent claim 1 and the dependent claims 2 to 5, and an apparatus according to the present invention is set forth by the independent claim 6 and the dependent claims 7 to 10.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hardware requirements on TX-div as described here are limited to two transmit signal paths/branches, with no need for a separate broadcast transmission signal path.<br>
The capacity/coverage improvement using adaptive antennas are previously described in a number of documents [2], [3], [4] referenced below. Without changing the cellular base-station grid including its sector coverage layout, the interference level in the system may be reduced (less interference is received and spatial spread out) by utilizing beam-forming methods with narrow-beams based on knowledge of the actual positions of the mobiles.<br>
Simultaneous transmission in several beams of present multi-beam base station antenna configurations requires coherent signal paths from the signals creation up to the antenna, including feeder cable coherency. The coherency is required for control of antenna pattern characteristics when transmission is directed to more than one beam. This may be solved by including calibration networks, which keep track of signal paths and of algorithms, which compensate for inaccuracies and variations. Another alternative for broadcast transmission is through a separate antenna system,<br>
In all previously presented solutions the amount of hardware and/or hardware requirements has been increased in order to facilitate transmission of broadcast information (cell coverage beam).<br>
In Figure 2 is shown the block diagram for a typical multi-beam configuration, with the corresponding beam pattern shown in Figure 3. In this configuration broadcast information is sent through a coherent combined radiation of signals. The other alternative for broadcast transmission, through a separate antenna system, with separate feeder is shown in Figure 4.<br>
The present inventive solution<br>
The present solution is to transmit broadcast information in two narrow-beams without signal coherency, simultaneously as transmitting dedicated information on separate narrow-beams.<br>
The main property utilized, for the solution proposed with this invention for maintaining cell-coverage pattern control when radiating in two beams simultaneously, is to use orthogonal polarization orientation for the two beams. The two orthogonal polarization directions can e.g. be linear polarization slanted ±45°. An example of a block diagram principally describing the invented solution is shown in Figure 5, and an example of the corresponding beam patterns for the two narrow-beams is shown in Figure 6.<br>
For two time-synchronized signals, there may be a shift of signal polarization direction in the overlapping region between the two beams, but signal level will remain at an expected level as shown schematically in Figure 7. Accordingly there does not exist any coherency requirement between different polarization planes.<br>
For two-signal time unsynchronized, the polarization of each set of beams will remain, and the signals from the two beams will be independent in the two original beam patterns.<br>
As a consequence, in the overlapping beam region, independent of time and phase relation, the transmitted signal in the two beams will be added in the receiver creating the cell-coverage pattern.<br>
Referring to Figure 5, signaling to a specific user #k is selected to be transmitted via a dedicated channel over two dedicated narrow-beams (#1 or #2). The selection of beams is based upon directional/angular/spatial information, which may be obtained from joint uplink transmission related to the specific user #k. Based upon this narrow-beam selection for the specific user #k at a time instant (adaptively updated decision), the signal to be transmitted is directed/switched by a switching means (10) to a combining unit (12). In this unit all active dedicated users selected for transmission over the specific narrow-beam (i.e., #1 or #2) are combined. The transmission of the combined signals<br>
from all narrow-beam #1 selected users are simultaneous with the transmission of the combined signals from all narrow-beam #2 selected users, i.e. both narrow-beams are active with different users signal at each time.<br>
In parallel to the described dedicated beam transmission, broadcast transmission needs to be conveyed defining the total cell coverage area by a broadcasting means (14). The total cell coverage area shall be matched by the coverage of the two fixed narrow-beams. The broadcast signal transmission is divided into two signal streams/ paths by a dividing means (16), one for each of the two narrow-beams (no coherency requirements exists between the two parallel signal streams/paths).<br>
The two broadcast signal streams/paths are combined in combining units (12) with the dedicated combined signals from all narrow-beam selected users in each of the two branches. The signals to the two antennas are then transmitted with in principal orthogonal polarization. An alternative solution is to combine dedicated users signals selected for transmission over the specific narrow-beam (# 1 or #2) together with the associated broadcast signal stream in the same combiner unit, see Figure 8.<br>
The above described switching and combination of the broadcast and all dedicated signals are preferable handled in base-band processing. This is of course possible to do either in analog or digital domain or combinations thereof. However, the switching and combining is preferable handled in the digital domain. Alternatively, all or part of the switching and combining of the described signals can be performed at IF (intermediate frequency) or RF (radio frequency).<br>
When and if RF components are introduced, a number of different power amplifiers (PA) positions are possible. After combination of several signals, linearity requirements is increased on the power amplifiers and handled by so called Multi-Carrier Power Amplifiers (MCPA). Before combination, so-called Single-Carrier Power Amplifiers (SCPA) are sufficient as the linearity requirements are less severe. The number of amplifiers needed is reduced for<br>
each level of combination of signals. But, of course the total requirement of output power is increased per amplifier for each level of signal combination.<br>
Due to the losses in the switching and combining components it can be advantageous and preferred to locate the PA's as late as possible in the transmit chain. As example, possible MCPA locations are indicated in Figure 5 and in Figure 8.<br>
Even though the main objective with the proposed invention is to handle downlink transmission, it is essential that the system can make transmit beam selections based upon directional/angular/spatial information. One alternative is to get this information from the associated uplink transmission from the user.<br>
For such an alternative, one example is to require overlaid beams (same beam direction) in both uplink and downlink to cover the same area. The innovation presented here may have orthogonal oriented polarization planes (e.g. linear polarization slanted ±45°) for uplink and downlink in each angular beam direction, as described in the invention [9], but in principle the proposed transmission solution does not impact the selection of receiver method.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to support/enable enhanced capacity/coverage for the downlink transmission direction. However, from a system perspective it is in principal essential to have capacity/coverage link balance between the two communication directions. If no link balance can be supported, one link will limit the capacity/coverage of the system and available performance for the non-limiting link can not be utilized. Implementing the proposed invention solution for the downlink, it may be important to also improve the uplink such that the enhanced capacity in the downlink can be utilized.<br>
A preferred configuration, to improve the uplink communication link, is to use the same dedicated beams in up-link and downlink. The uplink and downlink signals are separated in duplex filters attached to each of the dedicated beam feeders, according to Figure 9. The feeder cables for each beam carries both the uplink and downlink information. With this solution, two uplink signals are received from the two beam directions and diversity reception can be made.<br>
An alternative configuration is to use overlaid beams in both up- and down-link that covers the same area, but have orthogonal oriented polarization planes (e.g. linear polarization slanted ±45°). With this solution the dedicated beam direction #1 have one polarization orientation in uplink (e.g. -45°) and the orthogonal oriented polarization in downlink (e.g. +45°). For beam direction #2 the opposite polarization directions are used, according to Figure 10, In this solution separate feeder cables carries the up-link and downlink information.<br>
In both discussed configurations, two uplink signals are received from the two beam directions and diversity reception can be made. The uplink solutions exemplified in Figure 9 and Figure 10, can be used with any downlink solution, not limited to the one shown in the Figures.<br>
In Figure 11 is presented a flow diagram, which generally illustrates the proposed method in accordance with the present invention. Five steps 1 to 5 are applied for transmitting signals into a dedicated cell and at the same time producing a broadcast signal defining total cell coverage of a cellular system and still utilizing narrow-beams and non-coherent signal paths.<br>
Assuming antennas with the same height, the proposed uplink diversity configuration will have a directivity gain of approximately 3 dB compared to a conventional sector coverage system. This additional directivity gain is due to that the beam covers approximately half the azimuth angular region (half the cell).<br>
In a noise-limited environment, the proposed uplink diversity configuration will also give diversity gain from the 2 antenna branches. When the channel angular spread is rich, higher diversity can be expected. In total, the directivity and diversity gains of the proposed configuration is expected to outperform traditional and conventional sector coverage space or polarization diversity configuration. This is especially true for broadband type of systems like WCDMA.<br>
Further, in an interference-limited environment, the proposed uplink diversity configuration will also give additional interference suppression of approximately 3 dB in an environment with uniformly spread users. This additional interference suppression is due to that the beam cover approximately half the azimuth angular region (antenna pattern suppresses users from half the cell). In CDMA based systems, the gain from the interference suppression is especially valuable, since users using the same frequency channel/spectrum are co-located in the same cell.<br>
In the proposed invention solutions, downlink beams directed at different azimuth angles are discussed. The implementeation of the antenna for creating these beams can either be made with separate antenna units or using one antenna unit giving all the needed beams.<br>
Separate antennas for the two beams can typically be two conventional antennas with proper polarization directions. The two antennas can mechanically be directed/oriented towards the designed dedicated beam directions. Alternatively, the two separate antenna units may as well be positioned within a single enclosure, where the individual antenna unit either is pre-directed or can be mechanical directed within the enclosure.<br>
In the implementation using one antenna unit (where the same structure is used for both beams), a preferred solution uses an array antenna with beam-forming means (feed network for example Butler-matrix). In the simplest form the array have two columns with two polarization directions each,<br>
Feeding these two columns with separate but equal beam-forming network for each polarization, give common dedicated beam directions for up- and downlink suitable for all exemplified proposed invention solutions.<br>
Independent of selected antenna implementation, the total beam-form (beam-width, beam-direction, etc.) can be optimized for cell-coverage of omni-radiating sites, 3-sector sites, 6-sector sites, etc., giving overall good performance.<br>
Merits of the present invention<br>
The merits of the invention is to enable the potential performance {capacity/ coverage) advantages of two fixed beams as a TX-div solution, by enabling simultaneous transmission for both cell and narrow-beam coverage. This is made in a cost efficient way avoiding coherency requirements in the signal paths of the base station.<br>
In the proposed solution for WCDMA the amount of HW and requirements on the HW is equal to or lower than the requirements for the existing standardized conventional TX-div methods. The proposed solution is well in line to fit the current product development solutions/architecture.<br>
The invention is valid in a solution with several antennas as well as for a single package antenna.<br>
