				<td>Apparatus at a draw frame for supplying fibre slivers to a<br>
drawing mechanism comprising at least two pairs of rollers<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus at a draw frame<br>
for supplying fibre slivers to a drawing mechanism<br>
comprising at least two pairs of rollers, wherein the fibre<br>
slivers are fed to the drawing mechanism by a plurality of<br>
supply rollers mounted on a feed table, the fibre slivers -<br>
seen in a top view - running next to one another and<br>
towards one another latereilly, and a guide element being<br>
provided between the feed table and the drawing mechanism,<br>
the lateral faces of which guide element are capable of<br>
directing the incoming fibre slivers laterally.<br>
In a known apparatus, the guide element has two lateral<br>
faces which taper in towards one another, as a result of<br>
which the fibre slivers are guided laterally. In that<br>
arrangement, it happens that the fibre slivers arranged<br>
towards the outside are folded over one another. The fibre<br>
slivers are displaced upwards so that - in a side view -<br>
they are at different heights from one another, which can<br>
impair uniform transfer of the slivers and, especially,<br>
their horizontal orientation.<br>
Where the guide element includes, or is in the form of,<br>
a sliver thickness measuring element, sliver measurement<br>
can be impaired by the slivers' being folded over one<br>
another.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is therefore to<br>
provide an apparatus of the kind described at the beginning<br>
that avoids the mentioned disadvantages and, especially,<br>
that allows uniform transfer of the slivers and enables the<br>
slivers to be oriented substantially in a plane.<br>
The problem is solved by the characterising features of<br>
claim 1.<br>
As a result of the sliver-guiding means according to the<br>
invention, the fibre slivers are held down at a location in<br>
which they are still oriented substantially in a plane,<br>
that is to say in which the slivers arranged to the outside<br>
have not yet been folded over one another and over slivers<br>
arranged further to the inside. As a result it is ensured<br>
that the group of fibre slivers has a level orientation,<br>
which is important for entry into the nip of the pair of<br>
take-in rollers of the drawing mechanism. When a measuring<br>
element for determining thickness variations either in the<br>
fibre sliver group consisting of several slivers or for<br>
individual sliver measurement is provided between the feed<br>
table and the drawing mechanism, measuring the fibre<br>
slivers next to one another in a plane is highly<br>
advantageous. It is also advantageous for the apparatus<br>
according to the invention to be provided upstream of the<br>
drawing mechanism, upstream of the measuring element and/or<br>
upstream of a guide element directing the fibre slivers<br>
laterally.<br>
Claims 2 to 26 contain advantageous developments of the<br>
invention.<br>
The invention will be described hereinafter in greater<br>
detail with reference to exemplary embodiments shown in the<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1a shows, in a diagrammatic side view, a<br>
draw frame with the apparatus according<br>
to the invention between the feed table<br>
and the drawing mechanism;<br>
Fig. 1b is a top view in accordance with<br>
Fig. 1a;<br>
Fig. 2 shows, in a perspective view, guidance<br>
of the fibre slivers at the exit from<br>
the feed table;<br>
Fig. 3 shows, in a perspective view, a sliver<br>
guide with a sliver-guiding means<br>
arranged upstream in accordance with the<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 4 shows an eccentrically mounted sliver-<br>
guiding means;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a two-sided sliver-guiding means<br>
wherein the through-gap for the slivers<br>
is adjustable;<br>
Fig. 6a shows, in a top view, a sliver guide for<br>
a plurality of fibre slivers with a<br>
pre-former, upstream of which is<br>
arranged a sliver-guiding means<br>
according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 6b shows the sliver guide according to<br>
Fig. 6a, through the section I - I;<br>
Fig. 7a shows, in a top view, an individual<br>
sliver guide with a directing element<br>
and with a sliver-guiding means<br>
according to the invention arranged<br>
upstream; and<br>
Fig. 7b shows the individual sliver guide in<br>
cross-section.<br>
The side view according to Fig. la shows the feed<br>
region 1, the measurement region 2, the drawing mechanism 3<br>
and the sliver coiling 4 of a draw frame, for example a<br>
Triitzschler TD 03 draw frame. In the feed region 1, three<br>
spinning cans 5a to 5c (circular cans) of a draw frame are<br>
arranged below the sliver feed table 6 (creel) in two rows<br>
of cans (see Fig. lb); the feed slivers 7a to 7c are drawn<br>
off by means of supply rollers 8a to 8c and supplied to the<br>
drawing mechanism 3. With each driven supply roller 8a to<br>
8c there is associated a top roller 9a to 9c, which rotates<br>
together with the supply roller. Located in the region of<br>
the feed table are six roller pairs 8, 9 (cf. Fig. lb),<br>
each consisting of a top roller and a supply roller. Fibre<br>
slivers 7a to 7c are lifted out of the spinning cans 5a to<br>
5c and guided on the feed table 6 towards the draw frame.<br>
After passing through the drawing mechanism 3, the<br>
attenuated fibre sliver 7' reaches a revolving plate of a<br>
can coiler and is deposited in rings in the delivery can.<br>
The feed table 6 extends over the region of the entire<br>
sliver feed apparatus as far as the draw frame. One fibre<br>
sliver 7 is supplied to the draw frame from each of the<br>
spinning cans 5 by means of the fibre sliver feed<br>
apparatus. In each case, supply is carried out through a<br>
sliver feed location, each sliver feed location having a<br>
roller pair 8a, 9a; 8b, 9b; 8c, 9c (roller feed). In the<br>
region of each lower roller 8a to 8c, there is a guide<br>
member (not shown) for guiding the fibre slivers 7.<br>
Reference letter A denotes the running direction of the<br>
fibre slivers 7a, 7b and 7c. The fibre slivers 7a to 7c are<br>
nipped between the roller pairs 8, 9. Curved arrows denote<br>
the direction of rotation of the supply rollers 8a to 8c<br>
and the top rollers 9a to 9c. Each supply roller 8 is<br>
connected to a drive device. At the exit from the feed<br>
table 6 there is provided a guide device for the fibre<br>
slivers 7a to 7f, which guide device consists of a<br>
horizontal rod 10 of cylindrical cross-section, on the rear<br>
face of which there are fixed eight cylinders 11a to 11h.<br>
The axes of the cylinders 11a to 11h are oriented<br>
vertically and the spacing between the outer surfaces of<br>
the cylinders 11a to 11h is large enough for a fibre<br>
sliver 7a to 7f to pass through in each case without being<br>
impeded in its running. By that means, guide grooves which<br>
are open to the top are formed for the fibre slivers 7a to<br>
7f, that is to say the cylinders 11a to 11h have the<br>
function of guide members. Arranged downstream from the<br>
feed table 6 at the entry to the draw frame is a driven<br>
roller arrangement, for example two lower rider<br>
rollers 12a, 12b and three upper rider rollers 13.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 1b, on each side of the feed<br>
table 6 there is set out a row of three spinning cans 5<br>
(not shown), each parallel to the other. In operation, a<br>
fibre sliver 7 can be drawn out of all six spinning cans 5<br>
at the same time. In operation, it is, however, also<br>
possible so to proceed that the fibre sliver 7 is drawn off<br>
on only one side, for example from the three spinning cans<br>
5a to 5c, while the three spinning cans 5d to 5f on the<br>
other side are being replaced. Furthermore, on each side of<br>
the feed table 6, there are three supply rollers 8a, 8b, 8c<br>
and 8d, 8e, 8f, in each case arranged behind one another in<br>
the working direction A. Two supply rollers 8a, 8d; 8b, 8e;<br>
8c, 8f are, in each case, arranged coaxially with respect<br>
to one another. The supply rollers 8a to 8f have the same<br>
diameter, for example 100 mm. The speeds of rotation n of<br>
the supply rollers decrease in the working direction A,<br>
that is to say n1 &gt; n2 &gt; n3. In that manner, the<br>
circumferential speeds U of the supply rollers 8 decrease<br>
in the working direction A. As a result, it is possible to<br>
adjust individually the circumferential speeds U1, U2, U3 of<br>
the supply rollers 8 so that the feed tensioning of all the<br>
fibre slivers 7 can be as desired. The supply rollers 8 can<br>
be driven by way of gear trains or like transmission<br>
devices (not shown). The supply rollers 8 are, in each<br>
case, of two-part construction (in a manner known per se)<br>
and are of lengths that differ from one another. The length<br>
of the fibre slivers 7 in the feed region 1 decreases from<br>
the inside towards the outside. According to Figs, 1a, 1b,<br>
the fibre slivers 7a to 7f run from the feed table 6 of the<br>
feed region 1, by way of the guide device (rod 10,<br>
cylinders 11a to 11h), through the rider roller<br>
arrangement 12, 13, through the sliver guide 14 (including<br>
the measuring device) having the transport rollers 15, 16,<br>
through the drawing mechanism 3, the web guide, the sliver<br>
funnel having the draw-off rollers and the rotating plate,<br>
and into the can.<br>
Fig. 1b shows the rollers that are arranged, in each<br>
case, on the underneath side, 8a to 8f, 12a, 12b, 15, III,<br>
II and I. According to Fig. 1b, the fibre sliver group 7'<br>
comprising six fibre slivers 7 is subjected to entry creel<br>
tensioning in the region between the roller pairs 8, 9 and<br>
the rider roller apparatus 12, 13; the fibre sliver group<br>
7' comprising six fibre slivers 7 is subjected to rider<br>
roller tensioning in the region between the rider roller<br>
arrangement 12, 13 and the transport rollers 15, 16; and<br>
the fibre sliver group 7'' comprising six fibre slivers 7<br>
is subjected to transport roller tensioning in the region<br>
between the transport rollers 15, 16 and the intake<br>
rollers 26, III of the drawing mechanism 3.<br>
As Fig. lb shows in a top view, the fibre slivers 7a to<br>
7f run towards one another between the cylinders 11a to 11h<br>
and the draw-off rollers 15, 16. In the process, the fibre<br>
slivers 7a to 7f run towards one another in a first step<br>
between the cylinders 11a to 11h and the entry to the<br>
sliver guide 14 (guide element) and are brought further in<br>
towards one another by the conically tapering side walls of<br>
the sliver guide 14. A sliver-guiding means 17 (holding-<br>
down means) is arranged across the width upstream of the<br>
sliver guide 14 at a spacing a therefrom at which the fibre<br>
slivers 7a to 7f are arranged substantially in a plane (see<br>
Fig. la), that is to say the outer fibre slivers 7a and 7f<br>
have not been folded over. The spacing a can be about from<br>
5 to 40 mm, preferably from 10 to 15 mm. The sliver-guiding<br>
means 17 is in the form of a bar, is rounded off on its<br>
underside and has a smooth surface.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 2, at the end of the draw frame<br>
creel, the fibre slivers 7a to 7c are passed through the<br>
guide grooves, which are open to the top, between the guide<br>
members 11a to lid. The fibre slivers 7a to 7c - seen in<br>
the work direction A - run towards one another in somewhat<br>
tapering manner.<br>
According to Fig. 3, a sliver-guiding means 17 in the<br>
form of a bar extending across the width is arranged<br>
upstream of the entry to the sliver guide 14 at a spacing<br>
therefrom. The fibre slivers 7a to 7f pass through beneath<br>
and in contact with the sliver-guiding means 17.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an arrangement in which the sliver-guiding<br>
means 17 is eccentrically mounted at its two ends in<br>
mountings 18a, 18b (only 18a is shown). As a result of<br>
rotation (see curved double arrows) the width b of the<br>
through-gap b for the fibre slivers 7 can be adjusted.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 5, the sliver-guiding means is<br>
of two-part construction wherein a lower component part 17b<br>
is stationary, above which the sliver-guiding means 17a is<br>
mounted in adjustable manner so that the width b of the<br>
through-gap for the fibre slivers 7 can be adjusted.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 6a, a pre-former 19a, 19b having<br>
two lateral faces convexly curving in towards one another<br>
is arranged upstream of the sliver guide 14. The pre-former<br>
has no top or bottom surface, that is to say it is open to<br>
the top and bottom. At one of its ends, however, the<br>
lateral faces can be pivoted around a rotary linkage about<br>
a vertical axis. The lateral faces taper towards one<br>
another in the direction of the entrance opening of the<br>
sliver guide 14. Reference numerals 7a to 7g denote the<br>
entering fibre slivers, and 7 denotes the emerging fibre<br>
slivers. Arranged upstream of the pre-former 19a, 19b is a<br>
sliver-guiding means 17 according to the invention. Fig. 6b<br>
shows the inwardly tapering inner walls between the<br>
entrance and exit of the sliver guide 14. Associated with<br>
the sliver guide 14 is a sensing tongue 22 for measuring<br>
the thickness of the fibre slivers.<br>
According to Fig. 7a, a measuring device 20, for example<br>
a microwave measuring device, is provided for individual<br>
sliver (thickness) measurement of the fibre slivers 7a to<br>
7f. Arranged upstream of the measuring device 20 is a two-<br>
part directing element 18a, 18b, upstream of which is a<br>
sliver-guiding means 17 according to the invention.<br>
