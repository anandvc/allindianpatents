BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 is a front view illustrating an apparatus for<br>
30  manufacturing  sterilizing water  according  to the present<br>
invention,  and Figure  2  is  a  rear view illustrating an<br>
apparatus for manufacturing sterilizing water according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
As shown therein, the present invention relates to an<br>
35  apparatus for deodorizing a small component and rinsing a<br>
pollutant by electrolyzing water under a certain condition. An electrolytic bath 15 includes anode and cathode compartments  in which  a plurality  of  anode  and  cathode<br>
3<br><br>
plates are disposed at a center of a gasket having anode and cathode paths. In the anode and cathode compartments, a plurality of unit cells are partitioned by an ion substitution film and are arranged in series. The above-described construction is well disclosed in the U.S. patent application No. 09/154,833 and PCT/KR99/00509 invented by the applicant of the present invention.<br>
The construction of the electrolytic bath disclosed in the U.S. patent application . No. 09/154,833 is shown in Figures 5A and 5B.<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing a sterilizing water which is capable of more effectively manufacturing deodorizing and sterilizing water using the electrolytic bath 15 disclosed in the U.S. patent application No. 09/154,833 invented by the applicant of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5A is an exploded perspective view of an electrolytic bath 15 included in an apparatus of the present invention. Fig. 5B is a longitudinal sectioned view of the electrolytic bath of Fig. 5A, with the parts of the analyzer being assembled into a single body.<br>
As shown . in the drawings, the apparatus of this invention comprises an electrolytic bath with two types of units: a plurality, of anode and cathode units 10' and 20' alternately arranged in the electrolytic bath. The two types of units 10' and 20' are separated from each other by plurality of membranes or ion exchange membranes capable of isolating the cathodes from the anodes. That is, the anode and cathode units 10' and 20', individually forming a unit cell A, are alternately, arranged while being brought into close contact with each other. An inlet end plate 60',   having<br>
4<br><br>
two water inlets 61' and 62' , is attached to one end of the 		electrolytic bath, while an outlet end plate 70', having two  water outlets 71' and 72' , is attached to the other end of the electrolytic bath.<br>
As described above, the inlet end plate 60' has two water inlets 61' and 62' , while the outlet end plate 70' has<br>
two water outlets  71'  and 72' .  In the operation of the<br>
apparatus, water, introduced into the anode-units 10' through first inlet 61', becomes acidic water prior to being discharged from the apparatus through the first outlet 71' . Meanwhile, water, introduced into the cathode units 20' through the second inlet 62', becomes alkaline water prior to being discharged from the apparatus through the second outlet 72' .<br>
Each of the anode units 10' forms a unit cell "A"which comprises an anode plate 11' sided with two gaskets: a gap adjusting gasket 30'  and an electrolyte leakage prevention gasket 31', at its both sides. In the same manner, each of the cathode units 20' forms a unit cell "A" which comprises a cathode plate 21'  sided with two gaskets: a gap adjusting gasket 30' and an electrolyte leakage prevention gasket 31', at its both sides. Each of the two types of gaskets 30' and 31' has an opening at its center portion. In each gasket 30', .31' associated with each anode plate 11', two passages 12' are formed on the edge of the opening at diagonally opposite positions, thus communicating with an anode reaction chamber 13' defined between each anode plate 11' and each gasket 30', 31'. In the same manner, in each gasket 30', 31' associated with each cathode plate -21' , two passages 22' are formed on the edge of the opening at diagonally opposite positions, thus  communicating  with  a  cathode  reaction  chamber  23' defined between each cathode plate 21' and each gasket 30' , 31' .<br>
4A<br><br>
Each of the plates 11'  and 21' is holed at its four corners at positions corresponding to the inlets 61' and 62' and the outlet 71' and 72' of the two end plates 60' and 70', thus having four holes 80' at the four corners. In the same manner, each of the gaskets 30' and 31' has four holes 80' at positions corresponding to the four holes 80' of each plate 11', 21'. The holes 80', provided on the plates 11' and 21' the gaskets 30' and 31' , form passages for water introduced into the electrolytic bath through the inlets 61' and 62' of the inlet end plate 60' . As described above, two diagonally opposite passages 12' are formed on the edge of the opening of each gasket 30', 31' associated with each anode plate 11' so as to communicate with both the first inlet 61' and the anode reaction chamber 13'. Two diagonally opposite passages 22' are formed on the edge of the opening of each gasket 30', 31' associated with each cathode plate 21'. The two passages 22'  communicate with both the second inlet  62'  and the cathode reaction chamber 23' .  Therefore,  water,  introduced into the electrolytic bath through the first inlet 61.' , flows through the holes 80' of the anode units 10' prior to being introduced into the anode reaction chambers 13' through the passages 12' of said units 10' . However, since there is no passage 12' communicating with the second inlet 62', water, introduced into the electrolytic bath through the second inlet 62' , passes through the holes 80' of the anode units 10' without being introduced into the anode reaction chamber 13'. Water, introduced into the electrolytic bath through the second inlet 62', thus reaches each cathode unit cell "A" or each cathode unit 20' where the water is introduced into the cathode reaction chamber 23' through the passages 22' formed on the gaskets 30' and 31' of each cathode unit 20' . In a brief description,  water,  introduced into the first anode unit  10',  exclusively flows  into the two anode  reaction chambers 13' of said anode 'unit 10', thus being reacted in said reaction chamber 13' . Thereafter, the water flows from the first anode unit 10'  into the second anode unit 10' through the hole 80' of said second anode unit 10'. Such a<br>
4B<br><br>
process is repeated until acidic water is discharged from the electrolytic bath through the first outlet 71' . Meanwhile, water, introduced into the first cathode unit 20' , exclusively flows into the two cathode reaction chambers 23' of said cathode unit 20', thus being reacted in said reaction chambers 23' prior to flowing into the second cathode unit 20' through the hole 80' of said second cathode unit 20' . Such a process is repeated until alkaline water is discharged from the electrolytic bath through the second outlet 72'.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the sterilizing water manufacturing apparatus 50 according to the present invention includes a rectangular cubic housing 4. The housing 4 includes a slanted surface at a front upper portion of the same. An operation control panel unit 1 is formed at an upper portion of the slanted surface for controlling the operation of the apparatus. A movable roller 12 is disposed at a lower portion of .the housing 4.<br>
In addition, a front door 9 is installed at a front portion of the apparatus, and an electrolytic bath 15 is installed in the interior of the apparatus. There are an alkaline water pipe 17 and an acid water pipe 19 provided for flowing alkaline and acid water manufactured by the electrolytic bath 15.<br>
Control valves 11 and 13 are installed at the alkaline water pipe 17 and the acid water pipe 13 for properly draining manufactured water at a certain portion of the front surface of the electrolytic bath 15.<br>
The installation positions of the elements disposed at the front and rear surfaces of the electrolytic bath 15 may be changed to either surface.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, source water inlet pipes 25a and<br>
4C<br><br><br><br><br>
25b are installed behind the electrolytic bath 15 for thereby flowing source water into the interior of the electrolytic bath 15. A filter 15 is disposed behind the electrolytic bath 15 for filtering the source water before 5 the source water is flown into the interior of the electrolytic bath 15 through the source water inlet pipes 25a and 25b.<br>
A fuse 29, a current transformer 27, and a magnet 25, etc. are disposed at the upper portion of the electrolytic 10 bath 15. The current transformer 27 transforms a primary alternate current(AC) to a secondary direct current(DC) and flows to a corresponding element such as the control valve and the electrolytic bath.<br>
The construction and operation of the apparatus for 15  manufacturing  the sterilizing water according to the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A power and voltage display unit 3 are installed on a front upper surface of the operation control panel unit 1 20 installed on the front surface of the housing 4 for displaying the sizes of the power and voltage applied to the apparatus, and an operation button unit 5 is installed at a lower portion of the same. The operation button unit 5 includes an operation button, a stop button, a rinsing 25 button, etc. In an initial state or stop state of the apparatus, when the operation button is pressed, the operation starts. The stop button stops the operation of the apparatus.<br>
For example, in the automatic operation mode of the 30 apparatus, the rinsing button is used for rinsing the electrolytic bath for a certain time. When the rinsing button is manually pressed, the manufacture of the sterilizing and deodorizing operation is stopped, and the electrolytic bath is rinsed. 35 A plurality of lamps 7 are installed at a lower portion of the operation control panel unit 1. The lamps 7 are formed of an operation and rinsing lamp, a water supply stop lamp, an over current lamp, etc.<br>
5<br><br><br><br><br>
Among the above-described lamps, the operation and rinsing lamp displays the current operation state of the apparatus, and the water supply stop lamp is turned on when the source water is not supplied into the electrolytic bath 5 15 by detecting a pressure switch. In this case, the apparatus stops.<br>
The over current lamp is used to prevent the apparatus from being damaged by an over current applied thereto when the current is sharply increased due to a current leakage, 10  etc.<br>
The construction and operation of the elements disposed at the upper portion of the electrolytic bath 15 will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
First, the fuse 2 9 and the magnet 25 are used to 15 prevent a certain accident due to a current leakage, a discharge and short circuit. The current transformer 27 transforms an externally inputted primary AC into a DC and supplies the transformed current to the automatic valve, the electrolytic bath, etc. 20 Two source water inlet pipes 25a and 2 6b installed behind the electrolytic bath 15 are connected to a lower portion of the electrolytic bath 15 for thereby flowing the source water to the pipes through the filter 23.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the source water is changed to an<br>
25  alkali water by the electrolytic bath 15 and is manufactured<br>
through the second control valve 13a, and the source water<br>
is changed to an acid water by the electrolytic bath 15 and<br>
is manufactured through the second control valve 13b.<br>
At this time, the alkali and acid water processed by 30     the second control valves  13a and 13b are discharged to outside through the drainage pipe 21.<br>
Figure 3 is a view of an operation process of a sterilizing water manufacturing apparatus according to the present invention. 35 As shown therein, the foreign materials contained in the source water are filtered by the filter 23 before the source water is flown into the interior of the electrolytic bath 15. The source water is changed into acid and alkaline<br>
b<br><br><br><br><br>
water when the same flows through the anode and cathode compartments by an electrolysis for thereby manufacturing acid and alkaline water.<br>
The DC 20 is applied to the electrolytic bath 15 of the 5 present invention. The acid and alkaline water flown through the electrolytic bath 15 are flown through the rinsing water pipes 17 and 19 connected to the electrolytic bath 15, and control drainage valves 17a, 17b, 19a, and 19b are installed at the pipe 19 for controlling a draining operation of the 10  rinsing water. .<br>
Figures 4 A and 4C illustrate a detailed construction of the operation control panel unit 1 disposed at an upper front portion of the housing.<br>
As shown therein,  a display unit for displaying an 15  on/off state of the power, a voltage and current meter, a display unit for displaying an entire operation state of the apparatus,  etc.  are installed in  such a manner that the operation  of  the  apparatus  according  to  the  present invention is optimized. 20       As described above,  in the electrolytic bath of the apparatus for manufacturing the sterilizing water according to  the present  invention includes  a  plurality of  anode compartments  and  cathode  compartments  in which  anode and cathode plates are provided at a center of a gasket having '25  anode and cathode paths,  and a plurality of unit cells partitioned by an ion substitution film are formed in series. The housing of the apparatus includes the electrolytic bath, the filter connected to the electrolytic bath, the source water supply pipe, the rinsing water pipe, the control valve, 30  etc. The control panel unit is disposed at a front upper portion of the housing. Therefore, in the present invention, it is possible to more effectively manufacture deodorizing and sterilizing water.<br>
Although  the  preferred  embodiment  of  the  present<br>
35  invention  has  been  disclosed  for  illustrative  purposes,<br>
those  skilled  in  the  art  will  appreciate  that  various<br>
modifications,  additions  and  substitutions  are  possible,<br>
