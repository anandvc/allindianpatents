Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for establishing a session key in a wireless system.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
The U.S. currently utilizes three major wireless systems, with differing standards. The first system is a time division multiple access system (TDMA) and is governed by IS-136, the second system is a code division multiple access (CDMA) system governed by IS-95, and the third is the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) . All three communication systems use the IS-41 standard for intersystem messaging, which defines the authentication procedure for call origination, updating the secret shared data, and etc.<br>
Fig.l illustrates a wireless system including an authentication center (AC) and a home location register (HLR) 10, a visiting location register (VLR) 15, and a mobile 20. While more than one HLR may be associated with an AC, currently a one-to-one correspondence exists. Consequently, Fig, 1 illustrates the HLR and AC as a single entity, even though they are separate. Furthermore, for simplicity, the remainder of the specification will refer to the HLR and AC jointly as the AC/HLR. Also, the VLR sends information to one of a plurality of mobile switching centers (MSCs) associated therewith, and each MSC sends the information to one of a plurality of base stations (BSs) for transmission to the mobile. For simplicity, the VLR, MSCs and BSs will be referred to and illustrated as a VLR, Collectively, the ACs, HLRs, VLRs, MSCs, and BSs operated by a network provider are referred to as a network.<br>
A root key, known as the A-key, is stored only in the AC/HLR 10 and the mobile 20.  There is a secondary key,<br><br>
knovm as Shared Secret Data SSD, which is sent to the VLR 15 as the mobile roams (i.e., when the mobile is outside its home coverage area). The SSD is generated from the A-key and a random seed RANDSSD using a cryptographic algorithm or function. A cryptographic function is a function which generates an output having a predetermined number of bits based on a range of possible inputs, A keyed cryptographic function (KCF) is a type of cryptographic function that operates based on a key; for instance, a cryptographic function which operates on two or more argioments (i â€¢ e., inputs) wherein one of the arguments is the key. From the output and knowledge of the KCF in use, the inputs can not be determined unless the key is known. Encryption/decryption algorithms are types of cryptographic functions. So are one-way functions like pseudo random functions (PRFs) and message authentication codes (MACs). The expression KCFSK(RN') represents the KCF of the random number RN' using the session key SK as the key. A session key is a key that lasts for a session, and a session is a period of time such as the length of a call.<br>
In the IS-41 protocol, the cryptographic function used is CAVE (Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption) . When the mobile 20 roams, the VLR 15 in that area sends an authentication request to the AC/HLR 10. If operating in an unshared mode, the AC/HLR 10, using the VLR 15 as a communication conduit, authenticates the mobile 20 using the SSD associated with the mobile 20. However, in the shared mode, the AC/HLR 10 responds to the authentication request by sending the mobile's SSD to the VLR 15. Once the VLR 15 has the SSD, it can authenticate the mobile 20 independently of the AC/HLR 10. For security reasons, the SSD is periodically updated.<br>
The SSD is 128 bits long. The first 64 bits serve as a first SSD, referred to as SSDA, and the second 64 bits<br><br>
serve as a second SSD, referred to as SSDB. The SSDA is used in the protocol to update the SSD, and the mobile 20 and the network generate session keys using SSDB. In updating the SSD, IS-41 provides of measure of security by performing mutual authentication (i.e., the mobile and the network authenticate one another) during the update process. However, in generating session keys, IS-41 does not provide for mutual authentication.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
In the method for establishing a session key, a network and a mobile transfer codes between one another. The mobile uses these codes to authenticate the network, and the network uses these codes to authenticate the mobile. Besides performing this mutual authentication, the codes are used by the mobile and the network to establish the session key. In one embodiment, communication efficiency is improved by sending messages, forming part of the intended session, with the codes. Furthermore, the codes for performing mutual authentication are derived based on the messages.<br>

Detailed Description Of The Preferred Embodiments<br>
The method for establishing session keys according to the present invention will be described as employed by the wireless system shown in Fig. 1. For the purposes of discussion only, operation in the shared manner will be described, but one skilled in the art will understand that the system may also operate in the unshared mode. Furthermore, while numerous sessions exist, for purposes of providing examples only, the method according to the present invention will be described with respect to<br><br>
establishing session keys during call origination and call termination. It will also be appreciated that, for clarity, the transfer of well-known information, such as the mobile's identity information (e.g., mobile identification number, electronic serial number, etc.), between the mobile 20 and the network has not been described.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call termination according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the VLR 15 generates a random number RN using a random number generator, and sends the random number RN to the mobile 20 as a challenge along with a call termination request.<br>
In response, the mobile 20 generates a count value CM, and performs a KCF on the random number RN, the count value CM, Type data, and id data 0 using the SSDA as the key. This calculation is represented as KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN). Preferably, the KCF is a keyed message authentication code such as HMAC, but could be a PRF such as Data Encryption Standard-Cipher Block Chaining (DES-CBC) from NIST (National Institute of Standards). The mobile 20 includes a counter which generates the count value CM, and increments the count value CM prior to generating the challenge response (i.e., KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN) ) to each challenge from the network.<br>
The Type data represents the type of protocol being performed. Types of protocols include, for example, call termination, call origination, mobile registration, etc. The id data 0 indicates that the communication issued from a mobile, and id data 1 indicates that communication is from the network.<br>
The mobile 20 sends count value CM and KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN) to the network.   Because the VLR 15 initiated the<br><br>
current call termination protocol including the protocol for establishing a session key according to the present invention, the VLR 15 knows the Type data. Also, because communication from mobiles includes the same id data, this value is known by the VLR 15 as well. Accordingly, based on the received count value CM, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN) and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20.<br>
Once the mobile 20 has been authenticated, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM), and sends the calculated result to the mobile 20. The mobile 20, meanwhile, calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM) as well. The mobile 20 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM) matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the network.<br>
Both the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 generate the session key SK as PRFA-Key (CM, RN) ; wherein the PRF is preferably the DES-CBC algorithm.<br>
The mobile 20 stores the count value CM in semipermanent memory so that during power down, the count value CM is not re-initialized. This way, repetition of a count value is prevented; repetition of the count value permits an attacker to prevail in his attack. In a preferred embodiment, the count value is initialized using a random number and generated using a large bit counter such as a 64 or 75 bit counter. This provides security even when the mobile 20 crashes and loses the stored count value. Even if an attacker can cause a mobile to crash at will, and assuming it takes at least a second to initiate a session, it will take, for example, a year before the attacker manages to have the mobile repeat a count value when a 75 bit counter is used.<br><br>
As an alternative, instead of generating and sending a unique random number RN to each mobile, the VLR 15 generates a global random number RN; namely, the same random number for all the mobiles. In this alternative embodiment, the network sends the call termination request as a page on a control channelâ€¢<br>
This alternative embodiment applies, however, when the anticipated response time for the mobile 20, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this alternative embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, for the duration of a global random number the VLR 15 stores the count value CM and determines whether the received count value CM exceeds the previously stored count value. If the received count value CM does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CM does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated. When a new global random number is sent by the VLR 15, the stored count values for each mobile are erased, and the process of storing and comparing count values begins again.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call origination according to the first embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the mobile 20 sends a call origination request to the VLR 15. In return, the VLR 15 generates the random number RN using a random number generator, and sends the random number RN to the mobile 20.<br>
In response, the mobile 20 generates the count value CM, and performs a KCF on the random number RN, the dialed<br><br>
digits DD, the count value CM, Type data, and id data 0 using the SSDA as the key. This calculation is represented as KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN, DD) â€¢ The dialed digits DD are the telephone number of the party the mobile user wants to<br>
call.<br>
The mobile 20 sends the dialed digits DD, the count value CM and KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN, DD) to the network. Because the VLR 15 received the call origination request, the VLR 15 knows the Type data. Accordingly, based on the received dialed digits and count value CM, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 0, CM, RN, DD) and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20.<br>
Once the mobile 20 has been authenticated, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM), and sends the calculated result to the mobile 20. The mobile 20, meanwhile, calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM ) as well. The mobile 20 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFssDA(Type, 1, CM) matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the network.<br>
Both the mobile 20 and VLR 15 generate the session key SK as PRFA-Key(CM, RN) ; wherein the PRF is preferably the DES-CBC algorithm.<br>
As discussed above, mobile 20 stores the count value CM in semi-permanent memory, and the count value is initialized using a random number and generated using a large bit counter such as a 64 or 75 bit counter.<br>
As  an  alternative,  instead	of  generating  and<br>
sending a unique random number RN to	each mobile, the VLR<br>
15 generates a global random number	RN; namely, the same<br>
random number for all the mobiles.<br><br>
This alternative embodiment applies, however, when the anticipated response time for the mobile 20, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this alternative embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, for the duration of a global random number the VLR 15 stores the count value CM and determines whether the received count value CM exceeds the previously stored count value. If the received count value CM does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CM does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated. When a new global random number is sent by the VLR 15, the stored count values for each mobile are erased, and the process of storing and comparing count values begins again.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call termination according to a second embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the VLR 15 generates a random number RN using a random number generator, and sends the random number RN as a global challenge. When establishing a session key for call termination with the mobile 20, the VLR 15 sends a call termination request as a page to the mobile 20 on a control channel.<br>
In response, the mobile 20 generates, using a random number generator, a random number RM, and performs a KCF on the random number RN, the random number RM, Type data, and id data 0 using the SSDA as the key. This calculation is represented as KCFssDA(Type, 0, RM, RN) . Preferably, the KCF is a keyed message authentication code such as HMAC, but could be a PRF such as Data Encryption Standard-Cipher<br><br>
Block Chaining (DES-CBC) from NIST (National Institute of Standards).<br>
The mobi 1 e 20 sends the random number RM and KCFSSDA (Type, 0, RM, RN) to the network. Based on the received random number RM, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 0, RM, RN) and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20.<br>
Once the mobile 20 has been authenticated, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) , and sends the calculated result to the mobile 20. The mobile 20, meanwhile, calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) as well. The mobile 20 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the network.<br>
Both the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 generate the session key SK as PRFA-Key(RM, RN) ; wherein the PRF is preferably the DES-CBC algorithm.<br>
Furthermore, the embodiment of Fig. 4 applies when the anticipated response time for the mobile 20, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, the mobile 20 generates a count value CT in addition to the random number RM.<br>
Specifically, when a new global random number RN is received,, the mobile 20 initializes a counter included therein. Each time the mobile 20 generates a random number RM and a challenge response, the mobile 20 increments the counter to obtain the count value CT. Furthermore,  the challenge response generated by the<br><br>
mobile 20 is KCFssDA(Type, 0, RM , RN, CT) , and the mobile 20 sends the count value CT, the random number RM and this challenge response to the network. The VLR 15 stores received count values from each mobile for the duration of a global random number RN, and determines whether a count value CT received from a mobile exceeds the previously stored count value for that mobile. If the received count value CT does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CT does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated.<br>
If the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20, the VLR 15 generates and sends a challenge response of KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM, CT) . Additionally, in generating the session key, the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 calculate the session key as PRFA-Key (RM, RN, CT) .<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call origination according to the second embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the mobile 20 sends a call origination request to the VLR 15. In return, the VLR 15 generates the random number RN using a random number generator, and sends the random number RN as a global challenge.<br>
When the mobile user dials digits to make a call, the mobile 20 generates a random number RM using a random number generator and performs a KCF on the random number RN, the dialed digits DD, the random number RM, Type data, and id data 0 using the SSDA as the key. This calculation is represented as KCFSSDA (Type, 0, RM, RN, DD) .<br>
The mobile 20 sends the dialed digits DD, the random number RM and KCFSSDA (Type, 0, RM, RN, DD) to the network. Based on the received dialed digits and random number RM,<br><br>
the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 0, RM, RN, DD) and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20.<br>
Once the mobile 20 has been authenticated, the VLR 15 calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) , and sends the calculated result to the mobile 20. The mobile 20, meanwhile, calculates KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) as well. The mobile 20 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM) matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the network.<br>
Both the mobile 20 and VLR 15 generate the session key SK as PRFA-Key(RM ,RN) ; wherein the PRF is preferably the DES-CBC algorithm.<br>
Furthermore, the embodiment of Fig. 5 applies when the anticipated response time for the mobile, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, the mobile 20 generates a count value CT in addition to the random number RM.<br>
Specifically, when a new global random number RN is received, the mobile 20 initializes a counter included therein. Each time the mobile 20 generates a random number RM and a challenge response, the mobile 20 increments the counter to obtain the count value CT. Furthermore, the challenge response generated by the mobile 20 is KCFssDA(Type, 0, RM , RN, DD, CT) , and the mobile 20 sends the call origination request, the dialed digits DD, the count value CT, the random number RM and this challenge response to the network. The VLR 15 stores received count values from each mobile for the<br><br>
duration of a global random number RN, and determines whether a count value CT received from a mobile exceeds the previously stored count value for that mobile. If the received count value CT does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CT does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated.<br>
If the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20, the VLR 15 generates and sends a challenge response of KCFssDA(Type, 1, RM, CT) . Accordingly, when using a global random number RN only two rounds of communication are needed to establish the session key. Additionally, in generating the session key, the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 calculate the session key as PRFA-Key(RM, RN, CT) .<br>
Next, the third embodiment of the present invention will be described- In conventional wireless systems, after establishing the session key, messages are transferred between the mobile 20 and the network. The third embodiment of the present invention improves communication efficiency by incorporating the initial transfer of messages as part of the communication to establish the session key.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call termination according to a third embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the VLR 15 generates a random number RK using a random number generator, and sends the random number RN to the mobile 20 along with a call termination request.<br>
In response, the mobile 20 generates a random number RM, and calculates a session key SK as PRFA-KBY (RM, RN) â€¢ In the typical,  well-known fashion,  the mobile 20 also<br><br>
generates a message XM and a mobile message count value CTM associated therewith. Because the generation of messages and the message count value are well-known in the art, these processes will not be described in detail.<br>
The mobile 20 then performs a KCF on the message XM, the count value CTM, and the mobile id data of 0 using the session key SK as the key to generate an authentication tag. This calculation is represented as KCFSK (0, CTM, XM) . Preferably, the KCF is a keyed message authentication code such as HMAC, but could be a PRF such as Data Encryption Standard-Cipher Block Chaining (DES-CBC) from NIST (National Institute of Standards) .<br>
The mobile 20 sends the message count value CTM, the random number RM, the message XM and the authentication tag of KCFSK(0, CTM, XM) to the network. Based on the received random number RM, the VLR 15 calculates the session key SK in the same manner as did the mobile 20. The VLR 15 also calculates KCFSK (0, CTM, XM) based on the received message XM and the count value CTM, and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20.<br>
If the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20, the VLR 15 processes the message XM and the message count value CTM in the typical, well-known manner, and generates a network message XN and network message count value CTN in the typical, well-known manner. Because these processes are so well-known in the art, they will not be described in detail.<br>
The VLR 15 further calculates an authentication tag of KCFSK(1, CTN, XN) , where 1 is the network id data, and sends this authentication tag to the mobile 20 along with the message XN and the message count value CTN. The mobile 20 calculates KCFSK (1,  CTN,  XN)  based on the received<br><br>
message XN and the count value CTN, The mobile 20 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFSK(1, CTN, XN) matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the network; and thus, the session key SK.<br>
As an alternative, instead of generating and sending a unique random number RN to each mobile, the VLR 15 generates a global random number RN; namely, the same random number for all the mobiles. In this alternative embodiment, the network sends the call termination request as a page on a control channel.<br>
Furthermore, this alternative embodiment applies when the anticipated response time for the mobile, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number RN is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, the mobile 20 generates a count value CT in addition to the random number RM.<br>
Specifically, when a new global random number RN is received, the mobile 20 initializes a counter included therein. Each time the mobile 20 generates a random number RM and an authentication tag, the mobile 20 increments the counter to obtain the count value CT. Furthermore, the mobile 20 sends the count value CT along with the message count value CTM, the random number RM, the message XM and the authentication tag. The VLR 15 stores received count values from each mobile for the duration of a global random number RN, and determines whether a count value CT received from a mobile exceeds the previously stored count value for that mobile. If the received count value CT does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with<br><br>
authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CT does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated. Additionally, in generating the session key, the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 calculate the session key as PRFA-KeyCRn, RN, CT) .<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates the communication between the network and the mobile 20 to establish a session key during call origination according to the third embodiment of the present invention. Once the dialed digits DD are received from a mobile user, the mobile 20 generates a random number RM using a random number generator. As shown, the mobile 20 sends a call origination request, the random number KM and the dialed digits DD to the VLR 15,<br>
In response, the VLR 15 generates a random number I^, and calculates a session key SK as PRFA-Key(RM, RN) â€¢ In the typical, well-known fashion, the VLR 15 also generates a message XN and a mobile message count value CTN associated therewith. Because the generation of messages and the message count value are well-known in the art, these processes will not be described in detail.<br>
The VLR 15 then performs a KCF on the message XN, the count value CTN, and the network id data of 1 using the session key SK as the key to generate an authentication tag. This calculation is represented as KCFSK(1, CTN, XN) .<br>
The VLR 15 sends the message count value CTN, the random number RN, the message XN and the authentication tag of KCFSK(1, CTN, XN) to the mobile 20. Based on the received random number RN, the mobile 20 calculates the session key SK in the same manner as did the VLR 15. The mobile 20 also calculates KCFSK(1, CTN, XN) based on the received message XN and the count value CTN, and determines whether this calculated value matches the version received from the VLR 15. If a match is found, the mobile 20 authenticates the VLR 15.<br><br>
If the mobile 20 authenticates the VLR 15, the mobile 20 processes the message XN and the message count value CTN in the typical, well-known manner, and generates a network message XM and network message count value CTM in the typical, well-known manner. Because these processes are so well-known in the art, they will not be described in detail.<br>
The mobile 20 further calculates an authentication tag of KCFSK(0, CTM, XM) , where 0 is the mobile id data, and sends this authentication tag to the VLR 15 along with the message XM and the message count value CTM. The VLR 15 calculates KCFSK(0, CTM, XM) based on the received message XM and the count value CTM. The VLR 15 then verifies whether the calculated version of KCFSK(0, CTM, XM) matches the version received from the mobile 20. If a match is found, the VLR 15 authenticates the mobile 20; and thus, the session key SK.<br>
As an alternative, instead of generating and sending a unique random number RN to each mobile, the VLR 15 generates a global random number R^4; namely, the same random number for all the mobiles.<br>
Furthermore, this alternative embodiment applies when the anticipated response time for the mobile, as monitored by the network, is kept relatively the same as when a unique random number RN is sent. Stated another way, this embodiment applies when the validity period of the global random number RN is kept relatively short. If a longer validity period for global random numbers is desired, then, preferably, the mobile 20 generates a count value CT in addition to the random number RM.<br>
Specifically, when a new global random number RN is received, the mobile 20 initializes a counter included therein. Each time the mobile 20 generates a random number RM and an authentication tag,  the mobile 20<br><br>
increments the counter to obtain the count value CT, Furthermore, the mobile 20 sends the count value CT along with the call origination request. The VLR 15 stores received count values from each mobile for the duration of a global random number RN, and determines whether a count value CT received from a mobile exceeds the previously stored count value for that mobile. If the received count value CT does exceed the previously stored count value, then the VLR 15 goes forward with authenticating the mobile 20. If the received count value CT does not exceed the previously stored count value, the mobile 20 is not authenticated. Additionally, in generating the session key, the mobile 20 and the VLR 15 calculate the session key as PRFA-Key(RM, RN, CT) .<br>
Unlike some conventional methods for establishing the session key, the method according to the present invention provides an added measure of security by performing mutual authentication.<br>
The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways.
