POLYMERIC MICELLES FOR DRUG DELIVERY<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to United States provisional applications serial number 60/667,260, filed April 1, 2005, and 60/741,780, filed December 1, 2005, the entirety of each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to the field of polymer chemistry and more particularly to micelles and uses thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The development of new therapeutic agents has dramatically improved the quality of life and survival rate of patients suffering from a variety of disorders. However, drug delivery innovations are needed to improve the success rate of these treatments. Specifically, delivery systems are still needed which effectively minimize premature excretion and/or metabolism of therapeutic agents and deliver these agents specifically to diseased cells thereby reducing their toxicity to healthy cells.<br>
[0004] Rationally-designed, nanoscopic drug carriers, or "nanovectors," offer a promising approach to achieving these goals due to their inherent ability to overcome many biological barriers. Moreover, their multi-functionality permits the incorporation of cell-targeting groups, diagnostic agents, and a multitude of drugs in a single delivery system. Polymer micelles, formed by the molecular assembly of functional, ampbiphilic block copolymers, represent one notable type of multifunctional nanovector. [0005] Polymer micelles are particularly attractive due to their ability to deliver large payloads of a variety of drugs (e.g. small molecule, proteins, and DNA/RNA therapeutics), their improved in vivo stability as compared to other colloidal carriers (e.g. liposomes), and their nanoscopic size which allows for passive accumulation in diseased tissues, such as solid tumors, by the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect. Using appropriate surface functionality, polymer micelles are further decorated with cell-targeting groups and permeation enhancers that can actively target diseased cells and aid in cellular entry, resulting<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
in improved cell-specific delivery.<br>
[0006] While self assembly represents a convenient method for the bottom-up design of nanovectors, the forces that drive and sustain the assembly of polymer micelles are concentration dependent and inherently reversible. In clinical applications, where polymer micelles are rapidly diluted following administration, this reversibility, along with high concentrations of micelle-destabilizing blood components (e.g. proteins, lipids, and phospholipids), often leads to premature dissociation of the drug-loaded micelle before active or passive targeting is effectively achieved. For polymer micelles to fully reach their cell-targeting potential and exploit their envisioned multi-functionality, in vivo circulation time must be improved. Drug delivery vehicles are needed, which are infinitely stable to post-administration dilution, can avoid biological barriers (e.g. reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake), and deliver drugs in response to the physiological environment encountered in diseased tissues, such as solid tumors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. General Description:<br>
[0021] Bionanotechnology is a broad, multi-disciplinary field encompassing the biological, chemical, physical, and engineering sciences and is dedicated to the design and manipulation of biomaterials on the nanometer size scale. These "nanodevices" offer the potential to become highly advanced, multi-functional tools capable of detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment of diseases, such as cancer. In the case of drug delivery, nanoscopic therapeutic carriers, or "nanovectors," are a potentially promising method to selectively deliver chemotherapeutic agents to cancerous and other diseased tissue. The advantages of nano-sized encapsulation devices are numerous. For example, when compared to single molecule drugs or diagnostic agents, "nanovectors" can transport much larger quantities of such agents. Nanoscopic drug delivery systems are generally more apt to elude biological barriers, resulting in reduced inactivation or excretion of the encapsulated therapeutic. Multi-functionality is a common feature of nanovectors whereby multiple drugs, diagnostic agents, and targeting groups can be packaged into a single system. The bottom-up design of nanoscopic drug delivery systems often involves the precise self assembly of single molecules or polymeric units to create complex, multi-functional devices. [0022] Polymer micelles are one type of nanovector formed by the aqueous assembly of block copolymers that are polymer chains containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions. These structures often exist as spherical particles with a core-shell morphology and sub-micron diameter. Their size and structural uniformity impart a striking resemblance to virus particles, which are Nature's version of the perfect delivery system and are capable of highly efficient delivery to cells and tissue. It is believed that the nanoscopic size of viruses (approximately 20 to 400 nanometers in diameter) contributes to their ability to elude the body's natural defense mechanisms while proteins on the virus surface enable highly selective targeting and infection of specific cells. The design of nanovectors, such as block copolymer micelles, that effectively mimic the selectivity and evasiveness of viral particles remains a major goal of drug delivery research. Polymer micelles present a viable alternative due to the inherent modularity of block copolymers, which offer considerable tuning of the micelle size and surface functionality. In certain embodiments, micelles of the present are about 20 to about 200 nanometers in diameter. In<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
other embodiments, micelles of the present invention, as described in detail infra, are about 20 to about 250 nanometers in diameter.<br>
[0023] One advantage of the polymer micelle modularity is the ability to tune the core and shell components. This is particularly useful for drug delivery because the core of the assembly can serve as a reservoir for a variety of therapeutic agents while the hydrophilic shell imparts solubility and stability to the aqueous assemblies. From a pharmacokinetic viewpoint, the distribution of drug-loaded micelles is largely determined by the size and surface chemistry of the micelle and not by the drug itself. Thus, polymer micelles possessing a hydrophobic core are utilized for the encapsulation of potent, small molecule drugs that were previously shelved due to poor aqueous solubility. The isolation of hydrophobic chemotherapeutics in the micelle core has also provided new strategies to overcome multi-drug resistance (MDR) mechanisms in cancer cells. Polymer micelles with cationically charged, core-forming blocks are used to encapsulate biomolecules such as plasmid DNA and siRNA. Therapeutics of this type are normally susceptible to rapid in vivo degradation, and their encapsulation in polymer micelles improves their biodistribution profiles thus leading to future clinical successes.<br>
[0024] One biological barrier to any drug delivery system and another issue which cell-responsive nanovectors addresess is the non-specific uptake by the reticuloendothelial system. The RES consists of a host of cells which are designed to remove cellular debris and foreign particles from the bloodstream. Like viruses, synthetic nanovectors are more apt at escaping RES detection by the nature of their size. In addition, the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) is a commonly used method to reduce opsonization and non-specific RES uptake of small molecule, protein, and nanoparticulate drug carriers. See Harris, J. M.; Martin, N. E.; Modi, M. Clin. Pharmacokin. 2001, 40, 539-551; Bhadra, D.; Bhadra, S.; Jain, P.; Jain, N. K. Pharniazie 2002, 57, 5-29; Shenoy, D. B.; Araiji, M. A. Int. J. Pharm. 2005, 293, 261-270; and Torchilin, V. Adv. Drug. Del. Rev. 2002, 54,235-252. [0025] PEG has become a standard choice for the hydrophilic, corona-forming segment of block copolymer micelles, and numerous studies have confirmed its ability to reduce RES uptake of micellar delivery systems. See Kwon, G.; Suwa, S.; Yokoyama, M.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y.; Kataoka, K. J. Cont. Rel. 1994, 29, 17-23; Caliceti, P.; Veronese, F. M. Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 2003, 55, 1261-1277; Ichikawa, K.; Hikita, T.; Maeda, N.; Takeuchi, Y.; Namba, Y.; Oku, N. Bio. Pharm. Bull. 2004, 27, and 443-444. The ability to tailor PEG chain lengths offers numerous advantages in drug carrier design since studies have shown<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
that circulation times and RES uptake are influenced by the length of the PEG block. In general, longer PEG chains lead to longer circulation times and enhanced stealth properties. In a systematic study of PEG-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) micelles with PEG molecular weights ranging from 5,000 - 20,000 Da, Langer and coworkers found that micelles coated with 20,000 Da PEG chains were the least susceptible to liver uptake. After 5 hours of circulation, less than 30% of the micelles had accumulated in the liver. See Gref, R.; Minamitake, Y.; Peracchia, M. T.; Trubetskoy, V.; Torchilin, V.; Langer, R. Science 1994,255,1600-1603.<br>
[0026] While PEGylation of nanovectors is an effective method to reduce RES uptake and extend in vivo circulation lifetime, other challenges exist which limit the ultimate effectiveness of colloidal drug carriers. One such barrier relates to their self assembly and subsequent in vivo stability. Self assembly represents a convenient, bottom-up approach to nanovector design. The hydrophobic forces that drive the aqueous assembly of colloidal drug carriers, such as polymer micelles and liposomes, are relatively weak, and these assembled structures dissociate below a finite concentration known as the critical micelle concentration ("CMC"). The CMC value of these systems is of great importance in clinical applications since drug-loaded colloidal carriers are diluted in the bloodstream following administration and rapidly reach concentrations below the CMC (p.M or less) leading to micelle dissociation. In addition, non-specific interactions with surfactant-like components in the blood (e.g. proteins, lipids, etc.) also act to destabilize drug-loaded micelles. See Savic, R.; Azzam, T.; Eisenberg, A.; Maysinger, D. Langmuir 2006, ASAP article. These events often lead to premature drug release outside the targeted area, rendering the drug carrier and cell-targeting strategies ineffective.<br>
[0027] Despite the large volume of work on micellar drug carriers, little effort has focused on improving their in vivo stability to dilution. In most cases, amphiphilic block copolymers lack the functionality necessary for post-assembly crosslinking strategies. Wooley and coworkers have addressed this issue by crosslinking the poly(acrylic acid) corona of the polymer micelles, forming shell-crosslinked nanoparticles. See Thurmond, K. B.; Huang, H. Y.; Clark, C. G.; Kowalewski, T.; Wooley, K. L. Col!. Surf. B. 1999, 16, 45-54. Covalent crosslinking produces nanoparticles with improved stability and offers the additional benefit of enhanced therapeutic payload since the core-forming block is chemically removed after crosslinking. See Zhang, Q.; Remsen, E. E.; Wooley, K. L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000, 722,3642-3651.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
[0028] In a separate approach, Kataoka and coworkers have developed methods to reversibly crosslink the core of diblock polymer micelles to improve stability. For example, the chemotherapy drug cisplatin was encapsulated using PEG-b-poly(aspartic acid) copolymers, forming reversible chemical bonds in the micelle core. See Nishiyama, N.; Yokoyama, M.; Aoyagi, T.; Okano, T.; Sakurai, Y.; Kataoka, K. Langtnuir 1999, 15, 377-383. The micelles were stable to dilution as determined by dynamic light scattering studies, and the core-crosslinking was reversible in the presence of chloride ions, resulting in dissociation of the polymer micelles and release of cisplatin. However, in vivo studies using tumor-bearing mice showed remarkably fast decay of the cisplatin-loaded micelles, which resulted in accumulation of the drug in the liver and spleen. See Nishiyama, N.; Kato, Y.; Sugiyama, Y.; Kataoka, K. Pharm. Res. 2001, 18, 1035-1041. Kataoka's group has also reported alternative core crosslinking strategies that utilize disulfide chemistry. In this case, cysteine units were randomly incorporated into the lysine portion of PEG-b-poly(L-lysine) copolymers and used for encapsulation of antisense RNA. See Kakizawa, Y.; Harada, A.; Kataoka, K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 11247-11248; and Kakizawa, Y.; Harada, A.; Kataoka, K. Biomacromolecules 2001, 2, 491-497. The cysteine side chains were subsequently oxidized in the core to form disulfide crosslinked, RNA-loaded micelles. These micelles were shown to selectively dissociate in the presence of glutathione (GSH), a reducing agent found in appreciable quantities in the cell cytoplasm, offering an effective method for intracellular delivery of the therapeutic. Other core crosslinking techniques have been devised that utilize polymer end-groups, such as methacrylate and olefinic functionality, which are crosslinked by free radicals. See Iijima, M.; Nagasaki, Y.; Okada, T.; Kato, M.; Kataoka, K. Macromolecules 1999, 32, 1140-1146; and Tian, L.; Yam, L.; Wang, J. Z.; Tat, H.; Uhrich, K. E. J. Mat. Chem. 2004, 14, 2317-2324. One notable disadvantage of the core crosslinking approach is the inherent reduction of free-volume in the micelle core, which ultimately limits drug loading in the micelle.<br>
[0029] Armes and coworkers have used covalent chemistries to crosslink the outer core of micelles made from poly[(ethylene oxide)-WocA:-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-6/oc£-2-(diethylamino) methacrylate] copolymers. The addition of the bifunctional crosslinker, l,2-bis(2-iodoethoxy)ethane, was shown to effectively crosslink the 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block, forming irreversible quaternary ammonium crosslinks. See Liu, S.; Weaver, J. V. M.; Tang, Y.; Billingham, N. C; Armes, S. P. Macromolecules, 2002, 35, 6121-6131. McCormick and coworkers have synthesized<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
poly(ethylene oxide)-block-[(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-stat-(N-acryloxysuccinimide)]-blockt-(N-isopropylacrylamide) copolymers where the N-acryloxysuccinimide units are reacted with cystamine to crosslink the outer core of the micelle through reversible disulfide bonds. See Li, Y.; Lokitz, B. S.; Armes, S. P.; McCormick, C. L. Macromolecules 2006, ASAP article. [0030} To address these pressing issues and develop improved disease-fighting systems, the present application describes the design and synthesis of "smart," drug-loaded polymer micelles which are stable to dilution in circulation, can more effectively accumulate in diseased cells, and dissociate in response to the range of environmental changes commonly found in diseased tissue and cells.<br>
[0031] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides crosslmked micelles which effectively encapsulate hydrophobic or ionic therapeutic agents at pH 7.4 (blood) but dissociate and release the drug at targeted, acidic pH values ranging from 5.0 (endosomal pH) to 6.8 (extracellular tumor pH). In yet other embodiements, the pH value can be adjusted between 4.0 and 7.4. These pH-targeted nanovectors will dramatically improve the cancer-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic agents and minimize the harmful side effects commonly encountered with potent chemotherapy drugs. In addition, the utilization of chemistries which can be tailored to dissociate across a range of pH values make these drug-loaded micelles applicable in treating solid tumors and malignancies that have become drug resistant.<br>
[0032] The pH-responsive block copolymers and polymer micelles described herein are designed with an emphasis on modularity and multi-functionality. Although the encapsulation and delivery of doxorubicin and camptothecin are exemplified, it is contemplated that the present invention also provides a technology platform whereby a multitude of nanovectors are designed and tailored by simple variations in poly(amino acid) type and length, crosslinking chemistries, and surface targeting functionalities. Examples include polymer micelles with tailored ionic blocks for siRNA and protein encapsulation, reversible metal crosslinking strategies which incorporate MM contrast agents (e.g. iron and gadolinium derivatives), and the application of micelles with reactive surface functionality for attachment of drugs, permeation enhancers, and targeting groups.<br>
[0033] According to one embodiment, the present invention provides a micelle comprising a multiblock copolymer which comprises a polymeric hydrophilic block, a crosslmked poly(amino acid block), and a poly(amino acid block), characterized in that said micelle has an inner core, a crosslinked outer core, and a hydrophilic shell. It will be<br>

appreciated that the polymeric hydrophilic block corresponds to the hydrophilic shell, the crosslinked poly(amino acid block) corresponds to the crosslinked outer core, and the poly(amino acid) block corresponds to the inner core. According to another aspect, the present invention provides a drug-loaded micelle comprising a multiblock copolymer which comprises a polymeric hydrophilic block, a crosslinked poly(amino acid block), and a poly(amino acid block), characterized in that said micelle has a drug-loaded inner core, a crosslinked outer core, and a hydrophilic shell.<br>

[0044] As used herein, the phrase "natural amino acid side-chain group" refers to the side-chain group of any of the 20 amino acids naturally occuring in proteins. Such natural amino acids include the nonpolar, or hydrophobic amino acids, glycine, alanine, valine, leucine isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and proline. Cysteine is sometimes classified as nonpolar or hydrophobic and other times as polar. Natural amino acids also include polar, or hydrophilic amino acids, such as tyrosine, serine, threonine, aspartic acid (also known as aspartate, when charged), glutamic acid (also known as glutamate, when charged), asparagine, and glutamine. Certain polar, or hydrophilic, amino acids have charged side-chains. Such charged amino acids include lysine, arginine, and histidine. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that protection of a polar or hydrophilic amino acid side-chain can render that amino acid nonpolar. For example, a suitably protected tyrosine hydroxyl group can render that tyroine nonpolar and hydrophobic by virtue of protecting the hydroxyl group.<br>
[0045] As used herein, the phrase "unnatural amino acid side-chain group" refers to amino acids not included in the list of 20 amino acids naturally occuring in proteins, as described above. Such amino acids include the D-isomer of any of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids. Unnatural amino acids also include homoserine, ornithine, and thyroxine. Other unnatural amino acids side-chains are well know to one of ordinary skill in the art and include unnatural aliphatic side chains. Other unnatural amino acids include modified amino acids, including those that are N-alkylated, cyclized, phosphorylated, acetylated, amidated, azidylated, labelled, and the like.<br>

Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a I3C- or l4C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for example, as in neutron scattering experiments, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays.

A. Multiblock Copolymers<br>
[0076]	As described generally above, one embodiment of the present invention<br>
provides a micelle comprising a multiblock copolymer which comprises a polymeric hydrophilic block, a crosslinked poly(amino acid block), and a poly(amino acid) block, characterized in that said micelle has an inner core, a crosslinked outer core, and a hydrophilic shell.<br>
[0077] Amphiphilic multiblock copolymers, as described herein, can self-assemble in aqueous solution to form nano- and micron-sized structures. In water, these amphiphilic multiblock copolymers assemble by multi-molecular micellization when present in solution above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Without wishing to be bound by any<br>

particular theory, it is believed that the hydrophobic poly(amino acid) portion or "block" of the copolymer collapses to form the micellar core, while the hydrophilic PEG block forms a peripheral corona and imparts water solubility. In certain embodiments, the multiblock copolymers in accordance with the present invention possess distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic segments that form micelles. In addition, these multiblock polymers comprise a poly(amino acid) block which contains functionality suitable for crosslinking. It will be appreciated that this functionality is found on the corresponding amino acid side-chain. [0078] Multiblock copolymers of the present invention contain poly(amino acid) blocks and a water-soluble polymer block. Poly(amino acid) (PAA) segments possess a wide range of functionality and are natural building blocks with inherent biocompatibility. In addition, PAA copolymers are hydrolytically stable and can tolerate most chemical transformation conditions yet can be enzymatically degradable.<br>
[0079] In certain embodiments, the PEG block possesses a molecular weight of approx. 10,000 Da (225 repeat units) and contains at least one terminal amine hydrochloride salt used to initiate the synthesis of poly(amino acid) multi-block copolymers. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this particular PEG chain length imparts adequate water-solubility to the micelles and provides relatively long in vivo circulation times.

[0097] In certain embodiments, the R3 moiety of the R1 group of formula I is a group suitable for Click chemistry. Click reactions tend to involve high-energy ("spring-loaded") reagents with well-defined reaction coordinates, giving rise to selective bond-forming events of wide scope. Examples include the nucleophilic trapping of strained-ring electrophiles (epoxide, aziridines, aziridinium ions, episulfonium ions), certain forms of carbonyl reactivity (aldehydes and hydrazines or hydroxylamines, for example), and several types of cycloaddition reactions. The azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is one such reaction. Click chemistry is known in the art and one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that certain R3 moieties of the present invention are suitable for Click chemistry. [0098] Compounds of formula I having R3 moieties suitable for Click chemistry are useful for conjugating said compounds to biological systems or macromolecules such as proteins, viruses, and cells, to name but a few. The Click reaction is known to proceed quickly and selectively under physiological conditions. In contrast, most conjugation reactions are carried out using the primary amine functionality on proteins (e.g. lysine or protein end-group). Because most proteins contain a multitude of lysines and arginines, such conjugation occurs uncontrollably at multiple sites on the protein. This is particularly problematic when lysines or arginines are located around the active site of an enzyme or other biomolecule. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of conjugating the R1 groups of a compound of formula I to a macromolecule via Click chemistry. Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a macromolecule conjugated to a compound of formula I via the R1 group.<br>

reagents with well-defined reaction coordinates, giving rise to selective bond-forming events of wide scope. Examples include the nucleophilic trapping of strained-ring electrophiles (epoxide, aziridines, aziridinium ions, episulfonium ions), certain forms of carbonyl reactivity (aldehydes and hydrazines or hydroxylamines, for example), and several types of cycloaddition reactions. The azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition is one such reaction. Click chemistry is known in the art and one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that certain R3 moieties of the present invention are suitable for Click chemistry. [00137] Compounds of formula II having R3 moieties suitable for Click chemistry are useful for conjugating said compounds to biological systems or macromolecules such as proteins, viruses, and cells, to name but a few. The Click reaction is known to proceed quickly and selectively under physiological conditions. In contrast, most conjugation reactions are carried out using the primary amine functionality on proteins (e.g. lysine or protein end-group). Because most proteins contain a multitude of lysines and arginines, such conjugation occurs uncontrollably at multiple sites on the protein. This is particularly problematic when lysines or arginines are located around the active site of an enzyme or other biomolecule. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of conjugating the R1 groups of a compound of formula II to a macromolecule via Click chemistry. Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a macromolecule conjugated to a compound of formula II via the R1 group.<br>
[00138] According to one embodiment, the R3 moiety of the R1 group of formula II is an azide-containing group.

are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In certain embodiments, E is an ester. In other<br>
embodiments, the R3 moiety of the R1 group of formula II is wherein<br>
E is an electron withdrawing group, such as a -C(O)O- group and y is 0-6. [00139] As defined generally above, the Q group of formula II is a valence bond or a bivalent, saturated or unsaturated, straight or branched Ci_i2 alkylene chain, wherein 0-6<br>

methylene units of Q are independently replaced by -Cy-, -O-, -NH-, -S-, -OC(O)-, -C(O)O-, -C(O)-, -SO-, -SO2-, -NHSO2-, -SO2NH-, -NHC(O)-, -C(O)NH-, -OC(O)NH-, or -NHC(O)O-, wherein -Cy- is an optionally substituted 5-8 membered bivalent, saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl ring having 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, or an optionally substituted 8-10 membered bivalent saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl bicyclic ring having 0-5 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. In certain embodiments, Q is a valence bond. In other embodiments, Q is a bivalent, saturated Ci_i2 alkylene chain, wherein 0-6 methylene units of Q are independently replaced by -Cy-, -O-, -NH-, -S-, -OC(O)-, -C(O)O-, or -C(O)-, wherein -Cy- is an optionally substituted 5-8 membered bivalent, saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl ring having 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, or an optionally substituted 8-10 membered bivalent saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl bicyclic ring having 0-5 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur.<br>
[00140] In certain embodiments, Q is -Cy- (i.e. a Ci alkylene chain wherein the methylene unit is replaced by -Cy-), wherein -Cy- is an optionally substituted 5-8 membered bivalent, saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl ring having 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. According to one aspect of the present invention, -Cy- is an optionally substituted bivalent aryl group. According to another aspect of the present invention, -Cy- is an optionally substituted bivalent phenyl group. In other embodiments, -Cy- is an optionally substituted 5-8 membered bivalent, saturated carbocyclic ring. In still other embodiments, -Cy- is an optionally substituted 5-8 membered bivalent, saturated heterocyclic ring having 1-2 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. Exemplary -Cy- groups include bivalent rings selected from phenyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopenryl, or cyclopropyl.<br>
[00141] In certain embodiments, the Rx group of formula II is a crosslinkable amino acid side-chain group and Ry is a hydrophobic amino acid side-chain group. Such hydrophilic, or crosslinkable, amino acid side-chain groups include tyrosine, serine, cysteine, threonine, aspartic acid (also known as aspartate, when charged), glutamic acid (also known as glutamate, when charged), asparagine, histidine, lysine, arginine, and glutamine. Such hydrophobic amino acid side-chain groups include a suitably protected tyrosine side-chain, a suitably protected serine side-chain, a suitably protected threonine side-chain, phenylalanine, alanine, valine, leucine, tryptophan, proline, benzyl and alkyl glutamates, or benzyl and alkyl<br>
38<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
aspartates or mixtures thereof. Such ionic amino acid side chain groups includes a lysine side-chain, arginine side-chain, or a suitably protected lysine or arginine side-chain, an aspartic acid side chain, glutamic acid side-chain, a suitably protected aspartic acid or glutamic acid side-chain, histidine or a suitably protected histidine side-chain. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that protection of a polar or hydrophilic amino acid side-chain can render that amino acid nonpolar. For example, a suitably protected tyrosine hydroxyl group can render that tyrosine nonpolar and hydrophobic by virtue of protecting the hydroxyl group. Suitable protecting groups for the hydroxyl, amino, and thiol, and carboylate functional groups of Rx and Ry are as described herein.<br>
[00142] In other embodiments, the Ry group of formula II comprises a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid side-chain groups such that the overall poly(amino acid) block comprising Ry is hydrophobic. Such mixtures of amino acid side-chain groups include phenylalanine/tyrosine, phenalanine/serine, leucine/tyrosine, and the like. According to another embodiment, Ry is a hydrophobic amino acid side-chain group selected from phenylalanine, alanine, or leucine, and one or more of tyrosine, serine, or threonine. [00143] As defined above, Rx is a natural or unnatural amino acid side-chain group capable of forming cross-links. It will be appreciated that a variety of amino acid side-chain functional groups are capable of such cross-linking, including, but not limited to, carboxylate, hydroxyl, thiol, and amino groups. Examples of Rx moieties having functional groups capable of forming cross-links include a glutamic acid side-chain, -CH2C(O)CH, an aspartic acid side-chain, -CH2CH2C(O)OH, a cystein side-chain, -CH2SH, a serine side-chain, -CH2OH, an aldehyde containing side-chain, -CH2C(O)H, a lysine side-chain, -(CH2)4NH2, an arginine side-chain, -(CH2)3NHC(=NH)NH2, a histidine side-chain, -CH2-imidazol-4-yl. [00144] In other embodiments, Rx comprises a mixture of hydrophilic amino acid side-chain groups. Such mixtures of amino acid side-chain groups include those having a carboxylic acid functionality, a hydroxyl functionality, a thiol functionality, and/or amine functionality. It will be appreciated that when Rx comprises a mixture of hydrophilic amino acid side-chain functionalities, then multiple crosslinking can occur. For example, when Rx comprises a carboxylic acid-containing side-chain (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and a thiol-containing side-chain (e.g., cysteine), then the amino acid block can have both zinc crosslinking and cysteine crosslinking (dithiol). This sort of mixed crosslinked block is advantageous for the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the cytosol of diseased cells. When Rx comprises an amine-contaming side-chain (e.g., lysine or arginine) and a thiol-containing<br>
39<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
side-chain (e.g., cysteine), then the amino acid block can have both imine (e.g. Schiff base) crosslinking and cysteine crosslinlcing (dithiol). The zinc and ester crosslinked carboxylic acid functionality and the imine (e.g. Schiff base) crosslinked amine functionality are reversible in acidic organelles (i.e. endosomes, lysosome) while disulfides are reduced in the cytosol by glutathione or other reducing agents resulting in drug release exclusively in the cytoplasm.<br>

B. Crosslinking Chemistries<br>
[00162] In addition to advances in polymer micelle technology, significant efforts have been made in the development of stimuli-responsive polymeric materials that can respond to environmental pH changes. See Chatterjee, J.; Haik, Y.; Chen, C. J. J. App. Polym. Set 2004, 91, 3337-3341; Du, J. Z.; Armes, S. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 12800 - 12801; and Twaites, B. R.; de las Heras Alarcon, C; Cunliffe, D.; Lavigne, M; Pennadam, S.; Smith, J. R.; Gorecki, D. C; Alexander, C. J. Control. Release 2004, 97, 551-566. This is of importance for sensitive protein and nucleic acid-based drugs where escape from acidic<br>
63<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
intracellular compartments (i.e. endosome and lysosome) and cytoplasmic release are required to achieve therapeutic value. See Murthy, N.; Campbell, J.; Fausto, N.; Hoffman, A. S.; Stayton, P. S. J. Control. Release 2003, 89, 365-374; El-Sayed, M. E. H.; Hoffman, A. S.; Stayton, P. S. J. Control. Release 2005,104,417-427; and Liu, Y.; Wenning, L.; Lynch, M.; Reineke, T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126,1422-7423. Acid-sensitive delivery systems that can successfully escape the endosome and transport small-molecule chemotherapeutic drugs into the cytoplasm are also of interest since these carriers can bypass many of the cellular mechanisms responsible for multi-drug resistance. In some of these cases, the polymers are designed to respond to the significant pH gradient between the blood (pH 7.4) and the late-early endosome (pH ~ 5.0 - 6.0).<br>
[00163] There is additional interest in developing the cancer-specific, pH-sensitive targeting of therapeutics. For example, rapidly growing cells found in solid tumors have elevated glycolytic rates and increased lactic acid production when compared to healthy cells. These factors, along with poor lymphatic drainage present in cancerous tissue result in an excess of lactic acid and a subtle pH gradient between the blood and the solid tumor microenvironment (pH 6.5 - 7.0). See Kalllinowski, F.; Schlenger, K. H.; Runkel, S.; Kloes, M.; Stohrer, M.; Olcunieff, P.; Vaupel, P. Cancer Res. 1989, 49, 3759-3764. Although the design of materials which can respond to such small pH variations is clearly challenging, this mechanism, coupled with the EPR effect, represent an effective method for limiting drug release to solid tumors.<br>
[00164] In certain embodiments, the amphiphilic block copolymers and cell-responsive polymer micelles of the present invention are designed to combine the concepts of crosslinked polymer micelles and pH-sensitive drug targeting to construct "smart" nanovectors that are infinitely stable to dilution in the bloodstream but are chemically programmed to release their therapeutic payload in response to pH changes commonly found in solid tumors and cancer cells. By utilizing cancer-responsive nanovectors in conjunction with potent chemotherapeutic agents, long-standing clinical problems such as post-injection micelle stability and the targeted delivery of encapsulated therapeutics to cancer cells are addressed. Unlike previous examples of micelle crosslinking (i.e., core and shell crosslinking), the multi-block approach of the present invention allows for the effective crosslinking of polymer segments located at the interface of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymer blocks as shown in Figure 1. This approach is advantageous because stable micelles are prepared without sacrificing loading efficiency or altering the drug molecule<br>
64<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
during core crosslinking.<br>
[00165] In contrast to shell-crosslinked micelles, the crosslinking of multiblock copolymer micelles in accordance with the present invention is accomplished without large dilution volumes because micelle-micelle coupling does not occur. Such crosslinking will enhance post-administration circulation time leading to more efficient passive drug targeting by the EPR effect and improved active targeting using cancer-specific targeting groups. In addition, stimuli-responsive crosslinking may offer another targeting mechanism to isolate the release of the chemotherapy drug exclusively within the tumor tissue and cancer cell cytoplasm. [00166] Crosslinking reactions designed for drug delivery preferably meet a certain set of requirements to be deemed safe and useful for in vivo applications. For example, in other embodiments, the crosslinking reaction would utilize non-cytotoxic reagents, would be insensitive to water, would not alter the drug to be delivered, and in the case of cancer therapy, would be reversible at pH levels commonly encountered in tumor tissue (pH ~ 6.8) or acidic organelles in cancer cells (pH ~ 5.0 - 6.0).<br>

It will be appreciated that the L group of formula III represents crosslinked amino acid side-chain groups.

WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
[00174] In certain embodiments, the -M- moiety of the L group of formula III is zinc. In other embodiments, L forms a zinc-dicarboxylate crosslinking moiety. In certain embodiments, the crosslinking utilizes zinc-mediated coupling of carboxylic acids, a highly selective and pH-sensitive reaction that is performed in water. This reaction, which is widely used in cough lozenge applications, involves the association of zinc ions with carboxylic acids at basic pH. See Balcar, N. K. A.; Taylor, D. M.; Williams, D. R. Chem. Spec. Bioavail 1999, //, 95-101; and Eby, G. A. J. Anthnicrob. Chemo. 1997, 40, 483-493. These zinc-carboxylate bonds readily dissociate in the presence of acid.<br><br>
[00175] Scheme 1 above illustrates the reaction of an aqueous zinc ion (e.g. from zinc chloride) with two equivalents of an appropriate carboxylic acid to form the zinc dicarboxylate. This reaction occurs rapidly and irreversibly in a slightly basic pH environment but upon acidification, is reversible within a tunable range of pH 4.0 - 6.8 to reform ZnX2, where X is the conjugate base. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a variety of natural and unnatural amino acid side-chains have a carboxylic acid moeity that can be crosslinked by zinc or another suitable metal.<br>
[00176] In certain embodiments, L represents aspartic acid side-chains crosslinked with zinc. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the zinc aspartate crosslinks are stable in the blood compartment (pH 7.4), allowing for effective accumulation of the drug-loaded micelles in solid tumors by passive and active targeting mechanisms. In the presence of lactic acid concentrations commonly encountered in solid tumors or in acidic organelles of cancer cells, rapid degradation of the metal crosslinks leading to micelle dissociation and release of the drug at the tumor site. Preliminary, qualitative studies have shown that crosslinked zinc aspartate segments are reversible in the presence of a-hydroxyacids.<br>
[00177] The choice of zinc as a crosslinking metal is advantageous for effective micelle crosslinking. Zinc chloride and the zinc lactate by-product are generally recognized as non-toxic, and other safety concerns are not anticipated. Pharmaceutical grade zinc chloride is<br>
69<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
commonly used in mouthwash and as a chlorophyll stabilizer in vegetables while zinc lactate is used as an additive in toothpaste and drug preparation. The reaction is reversible within a tunable pH range, selective toward carboxylic acids, and should not alter the encapsulated chemotherapy agents. While zinc has been chosen as an exemplary metal for micelle crosslinking, it should be noted that many other metals undergo acid sensitive coupling with carboxylic acids. These metals include calcium, iron and aluminum, to name but a few. One or more of these metals can be substituted for zinc.<br>
[00178] The ultimate goal of metal-mediated crosslinlcing is to ensure micelle stability when diluted in the blood (pH 7.4) followed by rapid dissolution and drug release in response to a finite pH change such as those found in cancer cells. Previous reports suggest a widely variable and tunable dissociation pH for zinc-acid bonds (from approximately 2.0 to 7.0) depending on the carboxylic acid used and number of bonds formed. See Cannan, R. K.; Kibrick, A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1938, 60,2314-2320. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the concentration of zinc chloride and the number of aspartic acid, or other carboxylic acid-containing amino acid, repeat units in the crosslinlcing block will ultimately control the pH at which complete micelle disassembly occurs. The synthetic versatility of the block copolymer design is advantageous since one or more variables are tuned to achieve the desired pH reversibility. By simple adjustment of zinc chloride/polymer stoichiometry, pH-reversible crosslinking is finely tuned across the pH range of interest. For example, higher zinc concentrations yield more zinc crosslinks which require higher acid concentrations (i.e. lower pH) to dissociate. Adjustments in zinc/polymer stoichiometry will yield the desired pH reversibility, however other variables such as increasing the poly(aspartic acid) block length (i.e. 15-25 repeat units) further tune the reversible crosslinking reaction if necessary. [00179] In other embodiments, L comprises a mixture of crosslinked hydrophilic amino acid side-chain groups. Such mixtures of amino acid side-chain groups include those having a carboxylic acid functionality, a hydroxyl functionality, a thiol functionality, and/or amine functionality. It will be appreciated that when L comprises a mixture of crosslinked hydrophilic amino acid side-chain functionalities, then multiple crosslinking can occur. For example, when L comprises a carboxylic acid-containing side-chain (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and a thiol-containing side-chain (e.g., cysteine), then the amino acid block can have both zinc crosslinking and cysteine crosslinking (dithiol). This sort of mixed crosslinked block is advantageous for the delivery of therapeutic drugs to the cytosol of diseased cells because a second stimuli must be present to allow for drug reslease. For<br>
70<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
example, micelles possessing both carboxylic acid-zinc crosslinking and cysteine dithiol crosslinking would be required to enter an acidic environment (e.g. a tumor) and enter an environment with a high concentration of glutathione (e.g. in the cell cytoplasm). When L comprises an amine-containing side-chain (e.g., lysine or arginine) and a thiol-containing side-chain (e.g., cysteine), then the amino acid block can have both imine (e.g. Schiff base) crosslinking and cysteine crosslinking (dithiol). The zinc and ester crosslinked carboxylic acid functionality and the imine (e.g. Schiff base) crosslinked amine functionality are reversible in acidic organelles (i.e. endosomes, lysosome) while disulfides are reduced in the cytosol by glutathione or other reducing agents resulting in drug release exclusively in the cytoplasm.<br>

[00256] In other embodiments, when the Ry group of formula III is an ionic natural or unnatural amino acid side-chain, micelles of the present invention are useful for encapsulating ionic, or charged, therapeutic agents.

[00258] Targeting the delivery of potent, cytotoxic agents specifically to cancer cells using responsive nanovectors would have a clear impact on the well-being of the many thousands of people who rely on traditional small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides micelle-encapsulated forms of the common chemotherapy drugs, doxorubicin (adriamycin), a topoisomerase II inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase I inhibitor, or paclitaxel (Taxol), an inhibitor of microtubule assembly. These drugs are both effective chemotherapy agents but suffer from clinical problems which are effectively addressed by cancer-specific delivery. For example, the cytotoxic nature of these drugs affects tumors and healthy tissue alike, resulting in a multitude of side effects such as dermatitis, hair loss, and nausea. DOX side effects such as acute cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression are particularly problematic. Neutral doxorubicin, camptothecin, and paclitaxel are poorly soluble in water (i.e., hydrophobic), making them candidates for micellar delivery. Camptothecin, which possesses a hydrolytically degradable lactone ring, has a short half-life in aqueous solution, especially at elevated pH. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that encapsulation in the hydrophobic micelle core will significantly increase the half-life of the drug. A multitude of drug delivery systems have been employed to reduce the<br>
101<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
aforementioned problems associated with doxorubicin, camptothecin, and paclitaxel, with varying degrees of success.<br>
D. Polymer Conjugation<br>
[00259] In addition to their core-shell morphology, polymer micelles can be modified to enable passive and active cell-targeting to maximize the benefits of current and future therapeutic agents. Because drug-loaded micelles typically possess diameters greater than 20 run, they exhibit dramatically increased circulation time when compared to stand-alone drugs due to minimized renal clearance. This unique feature of nanovectors and polymeric drugs leads to selective accumulation in diseased tissue, especially cancerous tissue due to the enhanced permeation and retention effect ("EPR"). The EPR effect is a consequence of the disorganized nature of the tumor vascuiature, which results in increased permeability of polymer therapeutics and drug retention at the tumor site. In addition to passive cell targeting by the EPR effect, micelles are designed to actively target tumor cells through the chemical attachment of targeting groups to the micelle periphery. The incorporation of such groups is most often accomplished through end-group functionalization of the hydrophilic block using chemical conjugation techniques. Like viral particles, micelles functionalized with targeting groups utilize receptor-ligand interactions to control the spatial distribution of the micelles after administration, further enhancing cell-specific delivery of therapeutics. In cancer therapy, targeting groups are designed to interact with receptors that are over-expressed in cancerous tissue relative to normal tissue such as folic acid, oligopeptides, sugars, and monoclonal antibodies.

[00260] Compounds of any of formulae I, II, and III having R3 moieties suitable for Click chemistry are useful for conjugating said compounds to biological systems or<br>
102<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
macromolecules such as proteins, viruses, and cells, to name but a few. The Click reaction is known to proceed quickly and selectively under physiological conditions. In contrast, most conjugation reactions are carried out using the primary amine functionality on proteins (e.g. lysine or protein end-group). Because most proteins contain a multitude of lysines and arginines, such conjugation occurs uncontrollably at multiple sites on the protein. This is particularly problematic when lysines or arginines are located around the active site of an enzyme or other biomolecule. Thus, another embodiment of the present invention provides a method of conjugating the R1 groups of a compound of any of formulae I, II, and HI to a macromolecule via Click chemistry. Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a macromolecule conjugated to a compound of any of formulae I, II, and III via the R1 group.<br>

Such targeting groups include, but or not limited to monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (e.g. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, IgE antibodies), sugars (e.g. mannose, mannose-6-phosphate, galactose), proteins (e.g. Transferrin), oligopeptides (e.g. cyclic and acylic RGD-containing oligopedptides), and vitamins (e.g. folate). Alternatively, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, II, and HI is bonded to a biomolecule, drug, cell, or other suitable substrate.<br>

Oligopeptides which undergo conformational changes in varying pH environments such oligohistidine (HHHHH) also promote cell entry and endosomal escape. [00263] In other embodiments, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, n, and HI is bonded to detectable moieties, such as fluorescent dyes or labels for positron emission tomography including molecules containing radioisotopes (e.g. 18F) or ligands with bound radioactive metals (e.g. 62Cu). In other embodiments, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, II, and III is<br>
103<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PC17US2006/012382<br>

In other embodiments, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, II, and III is bonded to a semiconducting nanoparticle such as cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, or cadmium telluride or bonded to other metal nanoparticles such as colloidal gold. In other embodiments, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, II, and III is bonded to natural or synthetic surfaces, cells, viruses, dyes, drugs, chelating agents, or used for incorporation into hydrogels or other tissue scaffolds.

In another embodiment, the R moiety of any of formulae I, II, and III is an azide or an azide derivative which is capable of undergoing [3+2] cycloaddition reactions with complementary alkyne-bearing molecules and biomolecules (i.e. click chemistry).<br>
[00265] Click chemistry has become a popular method of bioconjugation due to its high reactivity and selectivity, even in biological media. See Kolb, H.C.; Finn, M.G.; Sharpless, K.B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 2004-2021; and Wang, Q.; Chan, T. R.; Hilgraf, R.; Fokin, V. V.; Sharpless, K. B.; Finn, M. G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 3192-3193. In addition, currently available recombinant techniques permit the introduction of azides and alkyne-bearing non-canonical amino acids into proteins, cells, viruses, bacteria, and other biological entities that consist of or display proteins.

Organic and inorganic metal-binding ligands can be used in conjunction with metal catalysts and include, but are not limited to, sodium ascorbate, tris(triazolyl)amine ligands, tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), and sulfonated bathophenanthroline ligands.

It will be appreciated that imine linkages can be further converted to stable amine linkages by treatment with a suitable reducing agent (e.g. lithium aluminum hydride, sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, etc.)<br>
[00270] In yet another embodiment, the R1 moiety of any of formulae I, II, and III is an amine (primary or secondary) or alcohol which is capable of undergoing reaction with biomolecules containing activated esters (e.g. 4-nitrophenol ester, N-hydroxysuccinimide, pentafluorophenyl ester, ortfzo-pyridylthioester), to form amide or ester linkages.

[00274] In certain embodiments, micelles of the present invention are mixed micelles comprising one or more compounds of formula I, II, or m. It will be appreciated that mixed micelles having different R1 groups, as described herein, can be conjugated to multiple other compounds and/or macromolecules.

Such a mixed micelle can be conjugated to different compounds and/or macromolecules via these different R1 groups. Such conjugation reactions are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include those described herein.<br>
4. General Methods for Providing Compounds of the Present Invention [00275] Multiblock copolymers of the present invention are prepared by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art and those described in detail in United States patent application serial number 11/325,020 filed January 4, 2006, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Generally, such multiblock copolymers are prepared by sequentially polymerizing one or more cyclic amino acid monomers onto a hydrophilic polymer having a terminal amine salt wherein said polymerization is initiated by said amine salt. In certain embodiments, said polymerization occurs by ring-opening polymerization of the cyclic amino acid monomers. In other embodiments, the cyclic amino acid monomer is an amino acid NCA, lactam, or imide.<br>
106<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br><br>
[00276] Scheme 2 above depicts a general method for preparing multiblock polymers of the present invention. A macroinitiator of formula A is treated with a first amino acid NCA to form a compound of formula B having a first amino acid block. The second amino acid NCA is added to the living polymer of formula B to form a compound of formula I' having two differing amino acid blocks. Each of the R',A, n, Q, Rx, Ry, m, and m' groups depicted in Scheme 2 are as defined and described in classes and subclasses, singly and in combination, herein.<br>
[00277] One step in the preparation of a compound of formula I comprises terminating the living polymer chain-end of the compound of formula I' with a suitable polymerization terminator to afford a compound of formula I. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the polymerization terminator provides the R2a group of formula I. Accordingly, embodiments directed to the R2a group of formula I as set forth above and herein, are also directed to the suitable polymerization terminator itself, and similarly, embodiments directed to the suitable polymerization terminator, as set forth above and herein, are also directed to the R2a group of formula I.<br>
[00278] As described above, compounds of formula I are prepared from compounds of formula I' by treatment with a suitable terminating agent. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that compounds of formula I are also readily prepared directly from compounds of formula I'. In such cases, and in certain embodiments, the compound of formula I' is treated with a base to form the freebase compound prior to, or concurrent with, treatment with the suitable terminating agent. For example, it is contemplated that a<br>
107<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT7US2006/012382<br>
compound of formula I' is treated with a base and suitable terminating agent in the same reaction to form a freebase of that compound. In such cases, it is also contemplated that the base may also serve as the reaction medium.<br>
[00279] One of ordinary skill in the art would also recognize that the above method for preparing a compound of formula I may be performed as a "one-pot" synthesis of compounds of formula I that utilizes the living polymer chain-end to incorporate the R group of formula I. Alternatively, compounds of formula I may also be prepared in a multi-step fashion. For example, the living polymer chain-end of a compound of formula P may be quenched to afford an amino group which may then be further derivatized, according to known methods, to afford a compound of formula I.<br>
[00280] One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a variety of polymerization terminating agents are suitable for the present invention. Such polymerization terminating agents include any R2a-containing group capable of reacting with the living polymer chain-end of a compound of formula I', or the free-based amino group of formula I', to afford a compound of formula I. Thus, polymerization terminating agents include anhydrides, and other acylating agents, and groups that contain a suitable leaving group LG that is subject to nucleophilic displacement.<br>
[00281] Alternatively, compounds of formula I' may be coupled to carboxylic acid-containing groups to form an amide thereof. Thus, it is contemplated that the amine group of formula I' or freease thereof, may be coupled with a carboxylic acid moiety to afford compounds of formula I wherein R2a is -NHC(O)R4. Such coupling reactions are well known in the art. In certain embodiments, the coupling is achieved with a suitable coupling reagent. Such reagents are well known in the art and include, for example, DCC and EDC, among others. In other embodiments, the carboxylic acid moiety is activated for use in the coupling reaction. Such activation includes formation of an acyl halide, use of a Mukaiyama reagent, and the like. These methods, and others, are known to one of ordinary skill in the art, e.g., see, "Advanced Organic Chemistry," Jerry March, 5th Ed., pp. 351-357, John Wiley and Sons, N.Y.<br>
[00282] A "suitable leaving group that is subject to nucleophilic displacement" is a chemical group that is readily displaced by a desired incoming chemical moiety. Suitable leaving groups are well known in the art, e.g., see, March. Such leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen, alkoxy, sulphonyloxy, optionally substituted alkylsulphonyloxy, optionally substituted alkenylsulfonyloxy, optionally substituted arylsulfonyloxy, and<br>
108<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
diazonium moieties. Examples of suitable leaving groups include chloro, iodo, bromo, fluoro, methanesulfonyloxy (mesyloxy), tosyloxy, triflyloxy, nitro-phenylsulfonyloxy (nosyloxy), and bromo-phenylsulfonyloxy (brosyloxy).<br>
[00283] According to an alternate embodiment, the suitable leaving group may be generated in situ within the reaction medium. For example, a leaving group may be generated in situ from a precursor of that compound wherein said precursor contains a group readily replaced by said leaving group in situ.<br>
[00284] Alternatively, when the R2a group of formula I is a mono- or di- protected amine, the protecting group(s) is removed and that functional group may be derivatized or protected with a different protecting group. It will be appreciated that the removal of any protecting group of the R2a group of formula I is performed by methods suitable for that protecting group. Such methods are described in detail in Green.<br>
109<br>
[00285] In other embodiments, the R2a group of formula I is incorporated by derivatization of the amino group of formula I', or freebase thereof, via anhydride coupling, optionally in the presence of base as appropriate. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that anhydride polymerization terminating agents containing an azide, an aldehyde, a hydroxyl, an alkyne, and other groups, or protected forms thereof, may be used to incorporate said azide, said aldehyde, said protected hydroxyl, said alkyne, and other groups into the R2a group of compounds of formula I. It will also be appreciated that such anhydride polymerization terminating agents are also suitable for terminating the living polymer chain-end of a compound of formula I', or freebase thereof. Such anhydride polymerization terminating agents include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Table 7, below.<br><br><br>

[00286] In other embodiments, the R4 moiety of the R2a group of formula III is incorporated by derivatization of the amino group of formula I', or freebase thereof, via reaction with a polymerization terminating agent having a suitable leaving group. It will also be appreciated that such polymerization terminating agents are also suitable for terminating the living polymer chain-end of a compound of formula I', or freebase thereof.

[00287] In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic polymer block is poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) having a terminal amine salt ("PEG macroinitiator"). This PEG macroinitiator initiates the polymerization of NCAs to provide the multiblock copolymers of the present invention. Such polymers having a terminal amine salt may be prepared from synthetic polymers having a terminal amine. Such synthetic polymers having a terminal amine group are known in the art and include PEG-amines. PEG-amines may be obtained by the deprotection of a suitably protected PEG-amine. Preparation of such suitably protected PEG-amines, and methods of deprotecting the same, is described in detail in United States patent application serial number 11/256,735, filed October 24, 2005 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00288] As described in USSN 11/256,735, suitably protected PEG-amines may be formed by terminating the living polymer chain end of a PEG with a terminating agent that contains a suitably protected amine. The suitably protected amine may then be deprotected to generate a PEG that is terminated with a free amine that may subsequently be converted into the corresponding PEG-amine salt macroinitiator. In certain embodiments, the PEG-amine salt macroinitiator of the present invention is prepared directly from a suitably protected PEG-amine by deprotecting said protected amine with an acid. Accordingly, in other embodiments, the terminating agent has suitably protected amino group wherein the protecting group is acid-labile.<br>
[00289] Alternatively, suitable synthetic polymers having a terminal amine salt may be prepared from synthetic polymers that contain terminal functional groups that may be converted to amine salts by known synthetic routes. In certain embodiments, the conversion of the terminal functional groups to the amine salts is conducted in a single synthetic step. In other embodiments, the conversion of the terminal functional groups to the amine salts is achieved by way of a multi-step sequence. Functional group transformations that afford amines, amine salts, or protected amines are well known in the art and include those described in Larock, R.C., "Comprehensive Organic Transformations," John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999.<br>

[00290] Scheme 3 above shows one exemplary method for preparing the bifunctional PEGs used to prepare the multiblock copolymers of the present invention. At step (a), the polymerization initiator is treated with a suitable base to form D. A variety of bases are suitable for the reaction at step (a). Such bases include, but are not limited to, potassium naphthalenide, diphenylmethyl potassium, triphenylmethyl potassium, and potassium hydride. At step (b), the resulting anion is treated with ethylene oxide to form the polymer E. Polymer E can be transformed at step (d) to a compound of formula A directly by terminating the living polymer chain-end of E with a suitable polymerization terminator to afford a compound of formula A. Alternatively, polymer E may be quenched at step (c) to form the hydroxyl compound F. Compound F is then derivatized to afford a compound of formula A by methods known in the art, including those described herein. Each of the R1, A, n, and Q groups depicted in Scheme 3 are as defined and described in classes and subclasses, singly and in combination, herein.<br>

[00292] Methods of preparing micelles are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Micelles can be prepared by a number of different dissolution methods. In the direct dissolution method, the block copolymer is added directly to an aqueous medium with or without heating and micelles are spontaneously formed up dissolution. The dialysis method is often used when micelles are formed from poorly aqueous soluble copolymes. The copolymer is dissolved in a water miscible organic solvent such as N-methyl pyrollidinone, diniethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethylacetamide, and this solution is then dialyzed against water or another aqueous medium. During dialysis, micelle formation is induced and the organic solvent is removed. Alternatively, the block copolymer can be dissolved in in a water miscible organic solvent such as N-methyl pyrollidinone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethylacetamide and added dropwise to water or another aqueous medium. The micelles can then be isolated by filtration or lyophilization.<br>
[00293] In one embodiment, drug-loaded miclles possessing carboxylic acid functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by addition of zinc chloride to the micelle solution along with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate to neutralize any hydrochloric acid by-product. In this basic pH environment, the reaction of zinc chloride with the poly(aspartic acid) crosslinking block should be rapid and irreversible.<br>
[00294] In another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing amine functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multi-functional aldehyde-containing molecule which forms pH-reversible imine crosslinks. In another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing aldehyde functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multi-functional amine-containing molecule which forms pH-reversible imine crosslinks.<br>
[00295] In another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing alcohol or amine functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multi-functional carboxylic acid-containing molecules and a coupling agent to form amide or ester crosslinks. In yet another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing carboxylic acid functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multi-functional amine or alcohol-containing molecules and a coupling agent to form amide or ester crosslinks. Such coupling agents include, but are not limited to, carbodiimides (e.g. l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC), diisopropyl carbodiimide (DIC), dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC)), aminium or phosphonium derivatives (e.g. PyBOP,<br>

PyAOP, TBTU, HATU, HBTU), or a combination of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and a aminium or phosphoniura derivative.<br>
[00296] In another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing aldehyde or ketone functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multifunctional hydrazine or hydrazide-containing molecule to form pH-reversible hydrazone crosslinks. In still other embodiments, drug loaded micelles hydrazine or hydrazide-functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of a bifunctional, or multifunctional aldehyde or ketone-containing molecule to form pH-reversible hydrazone crosslinks.<br>
[00297] In another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing thiol functionality in the outer core are crosslinked by the addition of an oxidizing agent (e.g. metal oxides, halogens, oxygen, peroxides, ozone, peroxyacids, etc.) to form disulfide crosslinks. It will be appreciated that disulfide crosslinks are reversible in the presence of a suitable reducing agent (e.g. glutathione, dithiothreitol (DTT), etc.).<br>
[00298] In yet another embodiment, drug loaded micelles possessing both carboxylic acid and thiol functionality in the outer core can be dual crosslinked by the addition of an oxidizing agent (e.g. metal oxides, halogens, oxygen, peroxides, ozone, peroxyacids, etc.) to form disulfide crosslinks followed by the addition of zinc chloride to the micelle solution along with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate to neutralize any hydrochloric acid by-product. It will be appreciated that such a dual-crosslinked micelle is reversible only in the presence of acid and a reducing agent (e.g. glutathione, dithiothreitol (DTT), etc.). [00299] According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for preparing a micelle comprising a multiblock copolymer which comprises a polymeric hydrophilic block, a crosslinked poly(amino acid block), and a poly(amino acid) block, characterized in that said micelle has an inner core, a crosslinked outer core, and a hydrophilic shell, said method comprising the steps of: (a) providing a multiblock copolymer of formula I:<br><br>

CMC Calculations: The CMC of micelles prepared from multiblock copolymers were determined using the method described by Eisnberg. (Astafieva, I.; Zhong, X.F.; Eisenberg, A. "Critical Micellization Phenomena in Block Copolymer Polyelectrolyte Solutions" Macromolecules 1993, 26, 7339-7352.) To perform these experiments, a constant concentration of pyrene (5 x 10"7 M) was equilibrated with varying concentrations of block copolymer (5 x 10"4 M to 1 x 10'8 M) in water at 50 °C for 2 hours, then stirred overnight. Examination of each sample's fluorescence excitation spectra (excited at 390 nm) revealed whether the pyrene was encapsulated in the diblock copolymer micelle (max=338 nm) or free in aqueous solution (X,max=333 nm). Plotting the ratio of the intensities between 338nm and 333nm (I338/I333) vs. log of the block copolymer concentration allows for the graphical interpretation of the CMC value, in these experiments, I338/I333 values of 1.3-1.5 represent pyrene encapsulated in block copolymer micelles and I338/I333 values of 0.5-0.6 correspond to<br>

Preparation of zinc crosslinked micelles with encapsulated pyrene: Crosslinked micelles containing encapsulated pyrene were prepared by stirring pyrene and propyne-aryl-poly(ethylene glycol)-6-poly(aspartic acid)-6-[poly(phenylalanine)-co-poIy(tyrosine)] in an aqueous zinc chloride solution at 50 °C for two hours then an additional 16 hours at room temperature (2.5 x 10"4 M polymer, 0.5 M ZnCl2, 5 x 10'7 M pyrene). 2 mL of 0.5 M NaHCO3 was added, raising the pH to 8.2 from 3.1, and resulting solution was allowed to stir for an additional 2 hours. The solution was diluted to give samples with polymer concentrations of 1 x 10"4, 5 x 10"55 1 x 10"5, 5 x 10"6 M. Examination of each sample's fluorescence excitation spectra (excited at 390 nm) revealed whether the pyrene was encapsulated in the diblock copolymer micelle (max=338 nm) or free in aqueous solution (max-333 nm). Plotting the ratio of the intensities between 338nm and 333nm (I338/I333) vs. log of the block copolymer concentration allows for the graphical interpretation of the CMC value.

micelles are present). A control experiment was performed in the absence of zinc chloride to show the effect of dilution on uncrosslinked micelles. Comparison between the zinc crosslinked micelles and uncrosslinked control experiments is shown in Figure 12.<br><br>
Reversing of Zinc Crosslink by pH Adjustment: The pyrene loaded crosslinked micelles were uncrosslinlced with the addition of acid. For these experiments, lactic acid (100 uL) was added to each of the crosslinked micelle samples and the fluorescence excitation spectra of pyrene recorded. The pH of the samples was lowered to pH 3.1 after the addition of the lactic acid (from 8.2 for the crosslinked micelles). Graph of the pyrene loaded crosslinked micelles before and after the addition of lactic acid is shown in Figure 13.<br>

Example 7<br>
Drug Loading and Crosslinking: Experimentally, the loading and crosslinking of drug-filled micelles is carried out by dissolving neutral doxorubicin and the block copolymer in a polar solvent such as ethanol, followed by slow addition to water or buffer solution. Due to the limited solubility of DOX and CPT in water, the drug is forced into the core of the micelle, effectively encapsulating the drug. Crosslinking is achieved by addition of zinc chloride to the micelle solution along with a small amount of sodium bicarbonate to neutralize any hydrochloric acid by-product. In this basic pH environment, the reaction of zinc chloride with the poly(aspartic acid) crosslinking block is rapid and irreversible. The crosslinked nanovectors are isolated using ultrafiltration membranes (Amicon Ultracel YM-30 membranes) and subsequently lyophilized before storage and/or characterization. Unencapsulated drug is removed by the ultrafiltration process, and drug-loading is quantified by dissolving known quantities of the drug-loaded, micelle powder in DMF and quantifying drug concentration by UV-Vis spectroscopy based on a previously determined extinction coefficients ( for neutral DOX and CPT (DOX absorbance at 485 nm, CPT absorbance at 370 nm).<br>
[00326] Drug-loaded, polymer micelles are characterized before and after zinc chloride addition to confirm the effectiveness of crosslinking and to quantify the pH at which micelle dissociation occurs. Fluorescence spectroscopy is an appropriate method to determine drug release from crosslinked polymer micelles in response to environmental changes since the fluorescence of micelle encapsulated DOX and CPT is negligible due to self-quenching in the micelle core but is highly fluorescent in its free form. After reversible crosslinking,<br>
134<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCTYUS2006/012382<br>
qualitative fluorescence experiments are performed to confirm effective crosslinking and stability of drug-loaded micelles. For example, crosslinked micelles are treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a common surfactant known to disrupt uncrosslinked micelles. After treatment with SDS, drug-filled micelles, both crosslinked and uncrosslinked, are evaluated using fluorescence spectroscopy to detect the presence of released DOX (excitation at 485 nm, emission at 590 nm) or CPT (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 432 nm). In the case of uncrosslinked micelles, fluorescence arising from free DOX or CPT in water is be observed due to SDS-induced micelle dissociation.<br>
Example 8 Fluorescence Assay<br>
[00327] In another set of experiments, samples of each of crosslinked polymer micelles, uncrosslinked polymer micelles, and free doxorubicin are incubated separately at 37°C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 hours. This commonly used cell growth medium is used to simulate the ion and pH environment encountered at physiological conditions. The concentration of DOX or CPT in the three samples are adjusted to an equivalent value (e.g. 100 ug/mL) and evaluated for dilution stability using fluorescence spectroscopy. In these experiments, all three samples are diluted to concentrations below the CMC of the polymer micelles (determined using pyrene fluorescence experiments described below). Fluorescence should be observed for the free DOX sample and DOX released from the dissociated, uncrosslinked micelles. If metal-mediated crosslinking is successful, fluorescence from the crosslinked micelles should not be observed, indicating enhanced micelle stability and limited drug release. [00328] Quantitative, acid titration experiments is performed on crosslinked, drug-loaded micelles to determine precise pH values or the pH range at which reversible micelle crosslinking occurs. These titration experiments are carried out by measuring fluorescence (reported in relative fluorescence units) at pH values ranging from ~ 7.4 (DMEM with serum) to 4.0. The pH of the DOX-loaded, crosslinked micelle solution is adjusted by the incremental addition of lactic acid or hydrochloric acid (HC1) and is measured directly in a stirred, fluorescence cell using a small pH probe (Lazar Ultra-M micro pH electrode). Titration curves are constructed by plotting fluorescence versus solution pH, and the pH at which reversible crosslinking occurs is determined by extrapolation, similar to the pyrene-CMC experiments described in Item D. Utilizing dilution volumes which are below the<br>

WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
copolymer CMC values is required since rapid micelle dissociation and drug release, as determined by an increase in quantum yield, are required to quantify pH reversibility. Titration experiments are repeated with crosslinked micelles made with various zinc chloride/block copolymer ratios with the ultimate goal of determining which micellar formulations undergo rapid dissociation at pH 6.8 (solid tumor microenvironment) and pH 5.0 - 5.5 (endosomal compartments). Fluorescence experiments analyzing the change in quantum yield of the free drug versus pH (control experiment) will also be undertaken to minimize the likelihood of a false positive result. Identical experiments, using encapsulated camptothecin and free CPT, are repeated for successful formulations to determine whether pH-sensitive dissociation and release varies with different encapsulated drugs. We anticipate that reversible crosslmking is independent of the drug utilized, permitting the use of a wide range of hydrophobic drugs. It is understood that carboxylic acid-containing therapeutics may require additional considerations when used in conjunction with zinc-mediated crosslmking.<br>
[00329] In addition to fluorescence experiments, light scattering analysis of polymer micelles is performed to determine both micelle size and morphology, which are important to future pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies. The polymer micelles are analyzed by dynamic and static light scattering experiments at 37 °C in phosphate buffer solution to determine average micelle size (e.g. hydrodynamic radius (Rh)) and micelle size distribution before and after drug loading. The ratio of radius of gyration (Rg), obtained by static light scattering, to Rh offers important information about particle morphology (i.e. spherical micelle, worm-like micelle, vesicle, etc.) before and after crosslmking reactions.<br>

[00330] In vitro testing of block copolymer micelles and drug-loaded nanovectors provides direct feedback on both the cellular uptake of nanovectors and potential toxicity of the block copolymers, crosslmking reagents, and the by-products of the reversible crosslinking reaction. Utilizing the inherent fluorescence of both doxorubicin and camptothecin as well as other common dyes, cellular uptake is monitored and trafficking of drug-filled and dye-filled nanovectors in cells lines such as MCF-7 (breast cancer), DOX-resistant MCF-7 (breast cancer), HeLa (cervical cancer), HepG2 (liver cancer), and Chinese hamster ovary (control) using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

comparing micelle-encapsulated forms of CPT and DOX to the free drugs in the five cell lines mentioned above.<br>
Cellular uptake of nanovectors and release of small molecule therapeutics in vitro [00331] Fluorescence microscopy is a frequently used method to investigate the<br>
interactions and intracellular fate of nanoparticulate drug carriers, such as liposomes and micelles, within target cells. To evaluate the uptake and cellular trafficking of cancer-responsive nanovectors, micelles are prepared with encapsulated dyes that fiuoresce inside the micelle (Oregon Green or Cy5) and monitored by CLSM. Small amounts of Cy5 are incorporated due to its high quantum yield and its tendency to self-quench at high concentrations in the micelle core. The dye-loaded micelles are evaluated in MCF-7 (ATCC, HTB-22™), DOX-resistant MCF-7 (prepared according to literature protocol), HeLa (ATCC, CCL-2™), HepG2 (ATCC, HB-8065™), and Chinese hamster ovary (ATCC, CCL-61™) cell lines to assay the background rate of uptake of crosslinked micelles by pinocytosis. Unless otherwise stated, HeLa, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary cells are grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-7 and DOX-resistant MCF-7 cells are grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) media with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. For confocal studies, cells are incubated in the presence of both non-loaded, crosslinked micelles (to establish any background fluorescence) and dye-filled, crosslinked micelles (dye - 1 ug/mL) directly on cover slips to a confluence of 60-70%, incubated with fluorescent nanovectors for 0.5, 1, or 4 hours, and mounted on glass slides using a fiuorophore-free mounting medium. In the case of MCF-7 and DOX-resistant MCF-7 cells, the cells are washed three times with PBS pH 7.4 and then fixed to the cover slips with a 1% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 minutes prior to mounting on the glass slides. Since both DOX and CPT require cellular entry and cytoplasmic delivery to be of therapeutic value, these basic uptake studies in a variety of cell cultures are an important benchmark in determining then- potential clinical usefulness. In general, micelles with diameters of 100 nm or less are taken up by cells, albeit indiscriminately, by pinocytosis. However, recent studies have shown that drug-loaded nanoparticles also undergo rapid exocytosis if endosomal escape is not achieved, and this phenomenon ultimately results in the reduced efficacy of the encapsulated drug. Notwithstanding this phenomenon, these same studies suggest that targeted nanovectors, which undergo uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME), are more apt to avoid exocytosis and may enter the cell through a different intracellular pathway.78<br>
137<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
[00332] Preliminary studies involving cell-targeted nanovectors are undertaken to compare micelle uptake by pinocytosis and RME. To accomplish this, acetylene-functionalized micelles are conjugated with azide-containing folate or an azide-containing GRGDS oligopeptide by click chemistry as shown in Figure 14. Relative to normal cells and tissue, the folate receptor is over-expressed in many epithelial malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and breast cancer and has been identified as a tumor marker. RGD-containing oligopeptides have been shown to bind to v3 integrins which are over-expressed on actively proliferating endothelium around cancerous tissue. Both targeting groups have been used extensively in drug delivery systems and have been shown to promote cellular uptake by cancer cells. Cellular uptake and distribution of cell-targeted, dye-filled micelles are evaluated in the five previously described cell lines. Previous studies involving folate-conjugated polymer micelles suggest that receptor-mediated endocytosis is a more efficient method of cellular entry when compared to simple pinocytosis. Micelle formulations which achieve the highest levels of cellular entry, as judged by intracellular fluorescence, are deemed the most promising. Using the click conjugation approach, a range of azide-functional, cell-targeting moieties are attached, making this approach advantageous for quickly evaluating multiple targeting groups in multiple different cell lines. [00333] Cellular uptake experiments using dye-filled or .dye-conjugated, crosslinked nanovectors are complemented with other confocal studies involving doxorubicin and camptothecin-filled micelles, which provide a signal indicating both uptake and release. As previously discussed, DOX and CPT are inherently fluorescent, but their quantum yield is significantly reduced in the micelle core due to self quenching. Utilizing this feature, drug distribution analysis of DOX- and CPT-loaded micelles are performed in the five previously described cell lines using confocal microscopy. Each cell line is incubated for 2 to 24 hours with no DOX or CPT (control), free DOX or CPT (1 uM), and drug-loaded micelles (both uncrosslinked and zinc-crosslinked, micelle concentration adjusted to achieve 1 uM DOX and CPT). The nucleus of the cells is stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes), and the culture media is replaced with phosphate buffer solution prior to confocal microscopy. DOX and CPT are topoisomerase inhibitors and require access to the nucleus to achieve therapeutic effects. If the drug-loaded micelles are taken up by cells and can escape endosomal compartments, then fluorescence from DOX and CPT should be observed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell. Successful micelle formulations will result in high concentrations of the released drugs in the cell nucleus. Special observation is made in<br>

WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
experiments involving folate-targeted micelles and non-targeted micelles in DOX-resistant MCF-7 cells. Drug-resistant cancer cells have over-expressed proteins which minimize chemotherapeutic entry {e.g. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression) or mechanisms to sequester weakly-basic drugs in acidic organelles {e.g. recycling endosome, lysosome, and trans-Golgi network).<br>
[00334] Drug-loaded nanovectors, particularly the folate-targeted micelles, are taken up by the DOX-resistant MCF-7 cells and rendered virtually invisible to cancer cells, offering a potentially effective approach to overcoming multi-drug resistance. Studies using drug-loaded micelles may also answer questions regarding the time-dependant release from the zinc-crosslinked micelles. For example, in comparison with free DOX and CPT, drug release from the crosslinked micelle formulation may be sustained over a much longer time period. Previously reported studies on uncrosslinked, DOX-loaded micelles suggest that similar therapeutic effects are achieved with fewer doses and lower concentrations of micellar DOX.84<br>
Example 11 Cytotoxicity Analysis [00335] While the block copolymer components and reagents used in these studies are<br>
generally recognized as safe, experiments are conducted to determine their cytotoxic concentration limits, if any, in five cell lines: MCF-7, DOX-resistant MCF-7, HeLa, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary. Cell viability tests are performed using a highly sensitive, ATP-based assay (Celltiter-Glo™, Promega) which uses the luciferase reaction to measure the number of viable cells in culture. The reagent is prepared by mixing with an appropriate buffer and then added directly to multi-well plates containing the cells to be tested. After mixing for two minutes, the plates are allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 minutes and then luminescence is measured using a luminometer equipped with a plate reader. This particular method was chosen because it is homogeneous with only a few plate-handling steps, data is collected within minutes after adding the Celltiter-Glo™ reagent, and it is more sensitive than traditional colormetric and fluorometric assays {e.g. MTT, alamarBlue, Calcein-AM). In addition to luminescence response due to apoptosis or necrosis, one must consider other variables which may change the cell number to luminescence relationship using this particular assay. These include the use of multi-well plates suitable for luminescence measurements, ATP variations due to cell density, and adequate mixing to ensure lysis and extraction of ATP from cells. Before cytotoxicity<br>
139<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
measurements are made, each cell line is seeded at ten different densities ranging from 0 to 50,000 cells per well, and the cell viability is tested using the cell viability assay described above. Since a linear relationship exists between luminescence (relative luminescence units) and the number of cells in culture, potential assay problems should be evident by large deviations from the standard, linear relationship. Also, an ATP standard curve, prepared using multi-well plates with varying concentrations of ATP in growth medium and recording luminescence following addition of the Celltiter-Glo™ reagent, are also useful in identifying procedural errors in the assay. In general, a tetrazolium salt MTT cell viability assay, which measures mitochondria function, are used in place of the ATP-based assay. [00336] To ascertain the cytotoxicity of the nanovectors and crosslinking reagents, viability studies comparing various concentrations of the block copolymer micelles (without DOX or CPT) using the five cell lines described previously are performed in triplicate using the previously detailed ATP-based assay. Specifically, each of the five cell lines are grown to 80% confluence and seeded at 7000 cells per well and incubated for 1 day at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Following incubation, the culture media is replaced with an equal volume of media containing 0 (control), 5, 10, 20, or 40 g/mL concentration of the multiblock copolymer. It should be noted that all of these concentrations are above the critical micelle concentration (approximately 3 g/mL), and therefore, the majority of the block copolymer is present in micellar form. Zinc-crosslinked micelles (without DOX or CPT) will also be evaluated in each of the cell lines at similar concentrations as described above. Assays are performed at 1, 3, and 5 days with no media change over the 5 day period, and cell viability is expressed as a percentage relative to samples grown without the block copolymer (control).<br>
[00337] Once the biocompatibility of the zinc-crosslinked and uncrosslinked multi-block copolymer micelles has been demonstrated, detailed cell viability studies are performed comparing free DOX and CPT versus their crosslinked and uncrosslinked micellar analogues. MCF-7, DOX-resistant MCF-7, HeLa, HepG2, and Chinese hamster ovary cells are plated into a 96-well plates (7,000 cells/well) and incubated in appropriate media for 1 day. Free DOX and CPT are added to the media in concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 uM, and the cells are incubated for 1, 3, and 5 days without media change. Cell viability assays are performed in triplicate using the Celltiter-Glo™ reagent according the previously described protocol, and the data is averaged and plotted against drug concentration as a best fit sigmoidal curve by using a nonlinear curve-fitting algorithm. IC50 values are reported as<br>
140<br><br>
WO 2006/107903	PCT/US2006/012382<br>
the drug concentration resulting in 50% cell viability. These experiments are repeated with uncrosslinked micelles, crosslinked micelles, and folate (in MCF-7 cells) or RGD-conjugated, crosslinked micelles (in HepG2 cells). The quantity of multiblock copolymer is adjusted, based on calculated micelle drug-loading values, to achieve comparable drug concentrations of 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 uM. IC50 values are calculated for each sample set to determine which formulation is most efficient in killing cancer cells. Cell viability is monitored over a five day period to ensure that adequate data points are obtained to properly evaluate all micelle formulations. For example, after 24 hours, free DOX might demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity when compared to a crosslinked, micellar formulation, but over longer time periods (i.e. 5 days), the micelle formulation may prove to be more effective due to slow release from the micelle core.<br>
[00338] Hemolysis studies comparing various concentrations of neutral doxorubicin and camptothecin versus drug-loaded micelles, both crosslinked and uncrosslinked, are performed using red blood cells (RBC) isolated from whole human blood. Stock solutions containing isolated RBC in PBS (108 RBC per 200 uL) at pH values of 5.8, 6.6, 7.4 are prepared, and various concentrations of the drugs, polymer micelles, and drug-loaded micelles are incubated at 37oC for 1 hour in each of the three RBC stock solutions. Following incubation, each RBC solution is subjected to centrifugation, and the hemoglobin release is determined spectrophotometrically at 541 nm. Hemolytic activity of each sample at varying pH values are expressed as a percentage of hemoglobin release relative to a 1% v/v Triton X-100 solution (positive control), which is assumed to give close to 100% hemolysis. Free DOX and CPT are evaluated at concentrations of 0 (negative control), 50,100, 200, and 400 ug/mL at each of the three pH values. Drug-loaded, multi-block copolymer micelles, both zinc-crosslinked and uncrosslinked, are assayed at pH 5.8, 6.6, and 7.4 and compared to the hemolytic activity of the free drug. The total polymer concentrations are adjusted, depending on known micelle drug loading, to achieve comparable DOX and CPT concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 ug/mL. We anticipate that the hemolytic activity of the micelle-encapsulated drug is dramatically reduced when compared to the free drug. Previous hemolysis studies of DOX-loaded PEG-i-poly(caprolactone) (PCL) showed no hemolytic activity of DOX in micelle form up to 225 ug/mL as compared to significant hemolysis (&gt;10%) observed for the free DOX at similar concentrations.<br>
