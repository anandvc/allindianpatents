				<td>SPRING RETAINER FOR A SYRINGE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention relates to a spring retainer for a syringe. More particularly, this invention<br>
relates to a spring retainer for a single-use, retractable syringe that facilitates prevention of syringe<br>
and / or needle use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The problems of shared syringes are notorious. The practice of sharing syringes without<br>
adequate sterilisation between successive users is a major contributor to the transfer of Human<br>
Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis with subsequent severe repercussions for the sufferer of such<br>
diseases and at a high cost to society of supporting and providing medical attention to those sufferers.<br>
A lesser but still significant risk associated with unclean needles and syringes arises from the<br>
possibility of inadvertent needle-stick injuries. This is particularly a problem for law enforcement<br>
officers and paramedics who often encounter users of illegal drugs in their professional activities.<br>
Additionally, the habits of illegal drug users are such that dangerous by-products of their activities,<br>
such as discarded syringes, are often left in places of public access presenting a risk to the users of<br>
areas such as public parks and school grounds.<br>
International Publication WO 01/80930 describes a single-use retractable syringe that is<br>
highly effective in preventing syringe re-use by ensuring full depression of the plunger during fluid<br>
delivery and by ensuring permanent withdrawal of the needle by the plunger back into the syringe<br>
barrel. In particular, retractable syringes such as described in International Publication WO 01/80930,<br>
Australian Patent 731159 and United States Patent 6,083,199 employ a spring to facilitate needle<br>
retraction and thereby prevent syringe re-use.<br><br>
However, resistance by the spring during plunger depression provides an undesirable "feel" to<br>
some syringes, such as intravenous drug users.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, in a broad form the present invention provides a spring retainer for a syringe that<br>
provides efficient retraction of a spent needle into the barrel of a retractable syringe while also having<br>
improved tactile properties to a syringe user.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a spring retainer for a syringe that comprises a barrel, a<br>
plunger and a spring, to which syringe a retractable needle is mounted so as to be capable of coupling<br>
with said plunger for retraction of said needle into said barrel, said spring retainer comprising a<br>
housing having first and second body members that co-operate to releasably maintain said spring in a<br>
compressed state until rotational disengagement of said first and second body members allows<br>
decompression of said spring to facilitate retraction of said plunger and said retractable needle when<br>
coupled thereto into said barrel.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a syringe comprising a barrel, a plunger, a spring<br>
retainer and a spring, to which syringe a retractable needle is mountable so as to be capable of<br>
coupling with said plunger for retraction of said needle into said barrel, said spring retainer<br>
comprising a housing having first and second body members that co-operate to releasably maintain<br>
said spring in a compressed state until disengagement of said first and second body members allows<br>
decompression of said spring to facilitate retraction of said plunger and said retractable needle when<br>
coupled thereto into said barrel.<br>
Suitably, the syringe is adapted so that a retractable needle is mountable thereto.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, said syringe is a retractable syringe having a retractable needle, in<br>
use said spring is compressed in said retainer until at or near completion of depression of said<br>
plunger to inject material from said syringe, decompression of said spring acting thereafter to<br>
facilitate withdrawal of said retractable needle into said barrel.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said spring retainer has a housing that comprises a first body<br>
member and a second body member which are releasably engageable to maintain said spring in an<br>
initial compressed state.<br>
According to this embodiment, disengagement of said first body member and second body<br>
member allows or facilitates decompression of said spring.<br>
Preferably, said plunger comprises means for engaging said housing to trigger, initiate,<br>
actuate or otherwise begin disengagement of said first body member and second body member.<br>
Such means may be in the form of one or more shoulders, tabs, flanges or other projections<br>
which can engage one or more, respective complementary mating portions of said housing.<br>
Suitably, said one or more, respective complementary mating portions of said<br><br>
housing may be in the form of ramps, slots, depressions, recesses or the like which in<br>
use can be engaged by said plunger means for engaging said housing.<br>
Preferably, disengagement of said first body member and second body<br>
member is accompanied by rotation of said second body member relative to said first<br>
body member, which in turn assists rotation of said plunger, when said retractable<br>
needle is coupled therewith, into a final, inoperable position.<br>
Throughout this specification, unless otherwise indicated, "comprise",<br>
"comprises" and "comprising" are used inclusively rather man exclusively, so that a<br>
stated integer or group of integers may include one or more other non-stated integers<br>
or groups of integers.<br>

It will be appreciated that herein is described an embodiment of a single use<br>
retractable syringe 10 comprising in part, components based on those originally<br>
described in International Publication WO 01/80930, Australian Patent 731159 and<br>
United States Patent 6,083,199, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, syringe 10 has plunger 20, barrel 40,<br>
retractable needle 50 and spring retainer 60. Spring retainer 60 is located in flared<br><br>
end 41 of barrel 40, and comprises first body member 70 and second body member<br>
80 that co-operate to house and maintain spring 90 in the initial compressed state<br>
shown in FIG. 1. Syringe 10 also comprises seal 11 located on plunger 20, which<br>
prevents leakage fluid between plunger 20 and internal wall 42 of barrel 40.<br>
Retractable needle 50 is mounted at needle end 44 of barrel 40 and comprises<br>
cannula 51 and barbed arms 52A, 52B mounted to body 53 that are engageable by<br>
respective barb-engaging apertures 22 of needle-engaging means 23 in plunger 20 to<br>
facilitate retraction of needle 50 at the end of delivery of the fluid contents of syringe<br>
10. This retraction is driven by de-compression of spring 90, as will be described in<br>
more detail hereinafter.<br>
Referring particularly to FIG. 2, a preferred embodiment is described wherein<br>
retractable needle 50 may be fitted at needle end 44 of barrel 40 by disc member 100<br>
that has indent 101 which co-operates with annular rib 46 on inside wall 42 of barrel<br>
40. O-ring seal 47 is seated in annular step 48 in barrel wall 42. Body 53 of<br>
retractable needle 50 has elbows 54A, 54B that are held by annular shoulder 104 of<br>
disc member 100 until retraction of retractable needle 50.<br>
It is also noted that according to this embodiment barbed arms 52A, 52B each<br>
comprise first barb 55A, 55B and second barb 56A, 56B. First barbs 55A, 55B<br>
provide a safety mechanism should second barbs 56A, 56B not properly engage<br>
respective barb-engaging apertures 22 to facilitate retraction of retractable needle 50.<br>
That is, first barbs 55A, 55B can engage barb-engaging apertures 22 should second<br>
barbs 56A, 56B fail to properly engage respective apertures 22.<br>
Disc member 100 has aperture 102 with recesses 103A, 103B which allow<br>
longitudinal movement of elbows 54A, 54B therethrough to allow retraction of<br>
needle 50, as will be described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, retractable needle 50 may be provided such as<br>
described in Australian Patent 731159 and United States Patent 6,083,199.<br>
As best seen in FIG. 3A and 3B, plunger 20 further comprises plunger shaft<br>
32 having shoulders 33A, 33B which respectively have inclined surfaces 34A, 34B<br><br>
and button 35 operable by a user.<br>
Barrel 40 is integrally formed with finger grips 43A, 43B and flared end 41<br>
into which is fitted spring retainer 60.<br>
Spring retainer 60 may be fitted into flared end 41 of barrel 40 such as by an<br>
interference fit whereby first body member 70 engages wall 42 of barrel 40 as shown<br>
in FIG. 3 A. According to this embodiment, first body member 70 is held in barrel 40<br>
by clips 79A, 79B engaging respective steps 45A, 45B in wall 42.<br>
An understanding of the operation of plunger 20, with particular regard to<br>
rotation of plunger 20 and alignment of needle engaging means 23 with retractable<br>
needle barbs 52A, 52B to facilitate needle 50 retraction can be gained by referring<br>
now to FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B.<br>
Plunger 20 includes first slot 24, second slot 25, retraction slot 26 and fourth<br>
slot 27. First slot 24 is interconnected to second slot 25 via first deviation 28, second<br>
slot 25 is interconnected to retraction slot 26 via second deviation 29, retraction slot<br>
26 is interconnected to fourth slot 27 via third deviation 30 and fourth slot 27 is<br>
interconnected to first slot 24 via fourth deviation 31. First slot 24 and retraction slot<br>
26	are longitudinally offset with respect to each other; second slot 25 and fourth slot<br>
27	are longitudinally offset with respect to each other, first deviation 28 and third<br>
deviation 30 are longitudinally offset with respect to each other; and second deviation<br>
29 and fourth deviation 31 are longitudinally offset with respect to each other, as<br>
indicated by arrows in FIG. 4A and FIG 4B.<br>
Second slot 25 comprises plurality of abutments 21A, first slot 24 includes<br>
first slot abutment 21B and retraction slot 26 includes plurality of retraction<br>
abutments 21C and lockout abutment 21D.<br>
In FIG. 4A and 4B, there is also shown first body member 70 of spring<br>
retainer 60 which comprises body 71 and collar 72 having first plunger aperture 74<br>
that slidably accommodates plunger 20, and first finger or projection 73A and second<br>
finger or projection 73B which are oriented so as to be longitudinally opposed to<br>
each other. First body member 70 further comprises respective tabs 75A, 75B inside<br>
body 71.<br>
In use, first finger or projection 73A and second finger or projection 73B<br><br>
engage a respective corresponding slot 24,25,26, or 27 as in FIG 4A or as in FIG.<br>
4B.<br>
Fingers 73A, 73B can respectively engage abutments 21A, 21B, 21C in slots<br>
of plunger 20 to facilitate prevention of re-use of plunger 20, in a manner similar to<br>
that described in International Publication WO 01/80930, as will be described in<br>
more detail hereinafter.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, projections 73A, 73B may be spherical or<br>
approximately so, to thereby smoothly, slidably engage slots that are appropriately<br>
configured to receive such spherical projections.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, spring retainer 60 comprises first body member 70<br>
and second body member 80 that when fitted together, co-operate to releasably<br>
maintain spring 90 in an initial, compressed state.<br>
Second body member 80 comprises second plunger aperture 81 that slidably<br>
accommodates plunger 20. Second body member 80 also comprises shoulder ramps<br>
82A, 82B and shoulder recesses 83A, 83B. Also present on external wall 84 of<br>
second body member 80 are circumferential ramps 85A, 85B which at one end have<br>
respective guides 86A, 86B and at an opposite end have respective scalloped recesses<br>
87A, 87B.<br>
First body member 70 and second body member 80 are fitted together on<br>
plunger 20 to compress spring 90 by way of guides 86A, 86B in sidewall 84 of<br>
second body member 80 receiving respective tabs 75A, 75B of first body member 70<br>
and rotating second body member 80 relative to first body member 70 so that tabs<br>
75A, 75B respectively fit into scalloped recesses 87A, 87B.<br>
When spring retainer 60 is assembled, second body member 80 is capable of<br>
limited, longitudinal or telescopic movement relative to first body member 70 against<br>
the action of compressed spring 90 without disengaging tabs 75A, 75B from<br>
scalloped recesses 87A, 87B and hence without inadvertently disengaging second<br>
body member 80 from first body member 70.<br>
Typically, this movement is limited to 0.1 to 1.0 mm, preferably to about 0.2<br>
to 0.8 mm or advantageously to about 0.5 mm, although this is readily varied<br>
according to the length and/or volume of the syringe, plunger and/or spring.<br><br>
Engagement between tabs 75A, 75B and scalloped recesses 87A, 87B limits<br>
rotation of second body member 80 relative to first body member 70 to no more man<br>
about 5°.<br>
Rotation of plunger 20 during syringe filling, injection and needle 50<br>
retraction may best be understood with reference to FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B and also<br>
with reference to International Publication WO 01/80930<br>
Initially, in use, first projection 73A is located in first slot 24 and second<br>
projection 73B is located in retraction slot 26.<br>
Withdrawal of plunger 20 is followed by first projection 73A slidably moving<br>
from first slot 24 into second slot 25 via first deviation 28 and second projection 73B<br>
slidably moving from retraction slot 26 into fourth slot 27 via third deviation 30. This<br>
causes a 90° rotation of plunger 20 with respect to barrel 50.<br>
During withdrawal of plunger 20, shoulders 33A, 33B are free to slidably<br>
travel through respective shoulder recesses 83A, 83B in second body member 80.<br>
Depression of plunger 20 to inject or expel material from barrel 40 occurs<br>
when first projection 73A is slidably located in second slot 25 and second projection<br>
73B is slidably located in fourth slot 27.<br>
Accordingly, at mis point barb-engaging apertures 22 of plunger 20 are<br>
aligned so as to be engageable with barbed arms 52A, 52B of retractable needle 50.<br>
During depression, spring 90 remains compressed by spring retainer 60 and<br>
only towards the end of depression of plunger 20 can decompression of spring 90<br>
occur.<br>
Initiation of disengagement of second body member 80 from first body<br>
member 70 is shown on FIG. 6, where inclined surfaces 34A, 34B of shoulders 33A,<br>
33B of plunger 20 engage respective shoulder ramps 82A, 82B to move second body<br>
member 80 longitudinally to further compress spring 90. This is accompanied by<br>
barb-engaging apertures 22 respectively engaging barbs 52A, 52B of retractable<br>
needle 50 to thereby couple plunger 20 to retractable needle 50.<br>
It is noted that inclined surfaces 34A, 34B of respective shoulders 33A, 33B<br>
of plunger 20 ensure only "last-minute" engagement of shoulder ramps 82A, 82B in<br>
second body member 80 at the very end of plunger 20 depression.<br><br>
Longitudinal movement of second body member 80 relative to first body<br>
member 70 is driven by lineal movement of plunger 20 which itself is unable to<br>
rotate because of first projection 73A engaging second slot 25 and second projection<br>
73B engaging fourth slot 27 of plunger 20. Force applied to plunger 20 by the user<br>
during plunger 20 depression is transferred to second body member 80 via<br>
engagement between inclined surfaces 34A, 34B of respective shoulders 33A, 33B<br>
and shoulder ramps 82A, 82B in second body member 80, which rotates second body<br>
member 80 relative to first body member 70 (which cannot rotate) enough to release<br>
engagement of scalloped recesses 87A, 87B by respective tabs 75A, 75B. This<br>
release initiates disengagement of second body member 80 from first body member<br>
70, thereby allowing spring 90 to decompress which, in turn, forces circumferential<br>
ramps 85A, 85B of second body member 80 to slide against tabs 75A, 75B of first<br>
body member 70 (which cannot rotate), thereby forcing rotation of second body<br>
member 80 relative to first body member 70 as it disengages first body member 70.<br>
This force is relayed to plunger 20 by second body member 80 bearing against<br>
shoulders 33A, 33B of plunger 20 thereby forcing rotation and retraction of plunger<br>
20 and retractable needle 50.<br>
This is the final 90° plunger rotation wherein first projection 73A moves into<br>
retraction slot 26 via second deviation 29 and second projection 73B moving from<br>
fourth slot 27 via fourth deviation 31 into first slot 24.<br>
At this point, and in a manner similar to that described in International<br>
Publication WO 01/80930, retractable needle 50 and plunger 20 coupled thereto are<br>
retracted into a final inoperable position, whereby projections 73B, 73A respectively<br>
engage abutment 21B in first slot 24 and abutment 21D in retraction slot 26 to<br>
prevent depression or further withdrawal of plunger 20 after retraction of retractable<br>
needle 50 into barrel 40.<br>
In an embodiment shown in FIG. 7, as second body member 80 becomes<br>
disengaged from first body member 70, it travels axially with plunger 20, driven by<br>
decompressed spring 90. Accordingly, second body member 80 travels axially until<br>
circumferential ramps 85A, 85B are respectively engaged by tabs 75A, 75B in first<br>
body member 70 thereby forcing second body member 80 to rotate in the direction<br><br>
shown by the arrow, which in turn rotates plunger 20 by virtue of engagement<br>
between shoulders 33A, 33B of plunger 20 and shoulder ramps 82A, 82B of second<br>
body member 80.<br>
By aligning projections 73A, 73B of first body member 70 respectively with<br>
second deviation 29 and fourth deviation 31, coupled to the rotation of plunger 20<br>
caused by rotation of second body member 80, rotation of plunger 20 into the<br>
aforementioned final, inoperable position is thereby assisted by rotation of second<br>
body member 80.<br>
This minimizes the likelihood of a situation where plunger 20 could fail to<br>
rotate fully and jam further plunger 20 movement, thereby leaving retractable needle<br>
SO only partially retracted.<br>
It will also be apparent that the embodiment of second body member 80<br>
shown in FIG. 7 has extended neck portion 88 wherein shoulder ramps 82A, 82B are<br>
somewhat recessed inside second body member 80 compared to the embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 4 or FIG. 5, for example. This assists prevention of a user tampering<br>
with engagement between plunger 20 and second body member 80 by effectively<br>
"burying" this inside second body member 80.<br>
Also present are ribs 89A, 89B which engage shoulders 33A, 33B of plunger<br>
20 and prevent a user forcing rotation of plunger 20 relative to second body member<br>
80.<br>
It will also be appreciated mat by plunger shoulders 33A, 33B having<br>
sufficient length (longitudinally along plunger shaft 21), it is possible to prevent<br>
rotation of plunger 20 when projections 73A, 73B have not yet respectively engaged<br>
retraction slot 26 and first slot 24 at the start of plunger 20 withdrawal. This assists<br>
prevention of a user seeking to rotate plunger 20 back into an operable position<br>
before withdrawal has commenced.<br>
It will therefore be apparent from the foregoing mat it is only at the very end<br>
of plunger 20 depression that decompressed spring 90 acts in facilitating plunger 20<br>
and retractable needle 50 withdrawal. This provides a much smoother feel to the<br>
operation of the syringe without any significant spring 90 resistance being felt during<br>
most stages of injection.<br><br>
Another advantage provided by the spring retainer 60 of the invention is that<br>
it can accommodate a spring 90 of various sizes, such as being operable with varying<br>
needle sizes and syringe sizes. In the higher volume syringes with longer needles, the<br>
length of spring 90 required to facilitate retraction of plunger 20 may be too great to<br>
fit easily on plunger 20 external to barrel 40. Spring retainer 60 compresses spring 90<br>
into a manageable size despite the uncompressed length of spring 90.<br>
Throughout the specification, the aim has been to describe the preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention without limiting the invention to any one embodiment<br>
or specific collection of features. Various changes and modifications may be made to<br>
the embodiments described and illustrated without departing from the present<br>
invention.<br>
For example, plunger means for engaging second body member 80 and the<br>
respective, complementary mating portions on second body member 80 may be any<br>
suitable arrangement not limited to shoulders 33A, 33B and shoulder ramps 82A,<br>
82B as described herein.<br>
Further to this, although tabs 75A, 75B and scalloped recesses 87A, 87B are<br>
examples of means for releasably coupling said first body member 70 and second<br>
body member 80, the invention contemplates any other arrangements that utilize<br>
complementary mating portions on first body member 70 and second body member<br>
80 to facilitate releasable coupling of said first body member 70 and second body<br>
member 80 to form said housing and thereby maintain spring 90 in an initial<br>
compressed state.<br>
It should also be appreciated that the invention contemplates an alternative<br>
embodiment wherein circumferential ramps 85A, 85B are replaced by respective<br>
channels or guide slots which allow tabs 75A, 75B to move longitudinally during<br>
disengagement of first body member 70 and second body member 80, without<br>
forcing rotation of second body member 80 and plunger 20 engaged therewith.<br>
It is also contemplated that abutments 21A, 21B, 21C and 21D described<br>
herein may be in the form of ledges, gates, ridges or any other means for restricting<br>
plunger movement as desired by the skilled person.<br><br>

syringe a retractable needle is mounted so as to be capable of coupling with said plunger for<br>
retraction of said needle into said barrel, said spring retainer comprising a housing having first and<br>
second body members that co-operate to releasably maintain said spring in a compressed state until<br>
rotational disengagement of said first and second body members allow decompression of said spring<br>
to facilitate retraction of said plunger and said retractable needle when coupled thereto into said<br>
barrel.<br>
2.	The spring retainer as claimed in claim 1, wherein the first body member comprises two or<br>
more projections capable of slidably engaging respective slots in said plunger to guide rotation of<br>
said plunger in use.<br>
3.	The spring retainer as claimed in claim 2, wherein said second body member comprises one<br>
or more recesses arranged so as to releasably engageable by respective tabs on said first body<br>
member.<br>
4.	The spring retainer as claimed in claim 3, wherein the second body member is adapted to be<br>
engageable by said plunger so that depression of the plunger triggers disengagement of said first body<br>
member and said second body member to thereby allow decompression of said spring.<br><br>
5.	The spring retainer as claimed in claim 4, arranged so that disengagement of said first and<br>
second body members of said housing can facilitate rotation of said second body member relative to<br>
said first body member.<br>
6.	The spring retainer as claimed in claim 5, wherein said second body member has<br>
circumferential ramps arranged so that decompression of said spring forces engagement of said<br>
ramps by said tabs to facilitate rotation of said second body member relative to said first body<br>
member.<br>
7.	A syringe comprising a barrel, a plunger, a spring retainer and a spring, to which syringe a<br>
retractable needle is mountable so as to be capable of coupling with said plunger for retraction of said<br>
needle into said barrel, said spring retainer comprising a housing having first and second body<br>
members that co-operate to releasably maintain said spring in a compressed state until disengagement<br>
of said first and second body members allow decompression of said spring to facilitate retraction of<br>
said plunger and said retractable needle when coupled thereto into said barrel.<br>
8.	The syringe as claimed in claim 7, wherein the first body member comprises two or more<br>
projections capable of slidably engaging respective slots in said plunger to guide rotation of said<br>
plunger in use.<br>
9.	The syringe as claimed in claim 8, wherein said second body member comprises one or more<br>
recesses arranged so as to be engageable by respective tabs on said first body member.<br><br>
10.	The syringe as claimed in claim 9, comprising plunger means for engaging respective<br>
complementary mating portions on said second body member.<br>
11.	The syringe as claimed in claim 10, wherein the plunger means comprises two shoulders<br>
engageable with respective shoulder ramps on said second body member.<br>
12.	The syringe as claimed in claim 11, arranged so that upon engagement between said two<br>
shoulders and respective shoulder ramps on said second body member, rotation of said shoulders<br>
selectively rotates said second body member relative to said first body member thereby disengaging<br>
said tabs from said recesses which disengages said first body member and said second body member<br>
to allow decompression of said spring.<br>
13.	The syringe as claimed in claim 12, wherein said second body member has circumferential<br>
ramps arranged so that decompression of said spring forces engagement of said ramps by said tabs to<br>
facilitate rotation of said second body member relative to said first body member.<br>
14.	The syringe as claimed in claim 13, arranged so that rotation of said second body member is<br>
capable of assisting rotation of said plunger into a final, inoperable position.<br>
15.	The syringe as claimed in claim 7, having said retractable needle mounted thereto, whereby in<br>
use said spring is maintained in a compressed state by said spring retainer until at or near completion<br>
of depression of said plunger when injecting material from said syringe.<br><br>
16.	The syringe as claimed in claim 15, arranged so that said plunger and said retractable needle<br>
are coupled at or near completion of depression of said plunger.<br>
17.	The syringe as claimed in claim 16, wherein disengagement of said first and second body<br>
members of said housing allows decompression of said spring, which facilitates retraction of said<br>
plunger when said retractable needle is coupled therewith.<br>
18.	The syringe as claimed in claim 17, arranged so that disengagement of said first and second<br>
body members of said housing can facilitate rotation of said second body member relative to said<br>
first body member.<br>
19.	The syringe as claimed in claim 18, arranged so that rotation of said second body member is<br>
capable of assisting rotation of said plunger, when said retractable needle is coupled therewith, into a<br>
final, inoperable position.<br>
20.	The syringe as claimed in claim 19, wherein said first body member comprises two or more<br>
projections capable of bearing against respective abutments in respective slots in said plunger to<br>
maintain said plunger in said final, inoperable position.<br>
21.	A spring retainer for a syringe substantially as described herein with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>
22. A syringe comprising a spring retainer substantially as described herein with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>
A spring retainer (60) for a syringe (10) that has a barrel (40), a plunger (20), a spring (90)<br>
and a retractable needle (50) that can couple with the plunger for spring-driven retraction of the<br>
coupled needle and plunger. The spring retainer has first (70) and second body (80) body members<br>
that cooperate to releasably maintain the spring in a compressed state until the plunger is coupled to<br>
the retractable needle after depression of the plunger to deliver the fluid contents of the syringe.<br>
Depression of the plunger triggers rotational disengagement of the first and second body members to<br>
allow decompression of the spring which forces retraction of the needle into the barrel. Rotational<br>
disengagement of the first and second body members also assists rotation of the plunger into a final,<br>
inoperable position.</td>
