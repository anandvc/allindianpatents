				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to care agents which comprise matrix particles having a perfume component and a washing-active surfactant component, where the matrix particles preferably consist of a gelatinous polysaccharide. The care agents can be used, for example, in body-cleansing compositions and household cleaners.<br>
The encapsulation of products in various technical fields (e.g. medicaments, dyes, foods etc.) is known in order to protect products from undesired influences prior to use, and to use them in a targeted manner.<br>
In the field of care agents, it is known to encapsulate surfactant components and optionally also perfume components as coacervates. Coacervates consist of a shell (e.g. made of gelatin, cellulose, gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and others, or combinations thereof) and a filling material.<br>
Release of the filling material from the coacervate is only possible by targeted mechanical or physical destruction of the shell. Easy release of the filling material associated with the use is desirable.<br>
As a result of the precipitation processes, loading of the coascervate capsules with relatively large solid or water-soluble constituents is not possible. However, for many application forms, e.g. the uptake of coloured particles, this is desired.<br>
An object of the present invention was to protect care agents, in particular for body-cleansing and technical use, from undesired impairment prior to use, to be largely unlimited in the choice of ingredients, and to permit easy release of the ingredients upon use.<br>
We have found care agents which comprise matrix particles having a perfume component and a washing-active surfactant component.<br>
The care agent according to the invention requires the action of only a small force to release the perfume component and optionally further ingredients. A further unexpected advantage of the matrix particles according to the invention is that, in contrast to coacervates, they can also be loaded with solid or water-soluble constituents. In the case of coacervates, this is not possible because of the filling process.<br>
Matrix particles for the care agents according to the invention are known per se (WO 98/15192, Gellan Gum, A Multi-functional Polysaccharide for Gelling and Texturising, Monsanto company brochure from 1992, Technical Bulletin" The Preparation of Kelcogel® Gellan Gum Products" company brochure from The Nutra Sweet Kelco Company RC-137).<br>
The matrix particles for the care agents according to the invention are multifunctional polysaccharides based on starch, guar, carob seed grain, tragacanth units, xanthan gum, gum arabic, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, methylcellulose and karaya gum. Particular preference is given to polysaccharides made from glucose, glucuronic acid and rhamnose. Particular preference is given here to a building block ratio of 2:1:1.<br>
Particularly preferred matrix particles for the care agents according to the invention consist of gellan gum. Gellan gum is a water-soluble polysaccharide obtained by aerobic fermentation from Pseudomonas eludea. The microorganisms are supplied by a nutrient medium with a carbon source, phosphates, organic and inorganic nitrogen compounds and trace elements. Prerequisites for growth conditions are sterile working procedures, the introduction of oxygen, agitation, and temperature and pH control. The fermentation mixture is then pasteurized in order to kill the living cells. Gellan gum is obtained from the fermentation mixture.<br>
During the addition reaction of salts onto the carboxyl groups, aggregation of the matrix particles takes place, X-ray diffraction analysis showing that the matrix particles have the structure of a laevorotating parallel double helix which is folded three times.<br>
Matrix particles having a perfume component can be prepared, for example, by dissolving a multifunctional polysaccharide in water at a suitable hydration temperature, adding the perfume component and preparing an emulsion, the emulsion being added dropwise to an aqueous solution of salts.<br>
Polysaccharide and perfume component are generally used in the ratio 1 to 30, preferably 1 to 20.<br>
Salts are preferably calcium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride and sodium chloride.<br>
The aqueous solution generally comprises 0.001 to 2 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 to 0.5 parts by weight, of salts.<br>
The size of the matrix particles can be controlled by the size of the dropping capillary.<br>
The care agents according to the invention generally comprise 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 15 parts by weight, particularly preferably 8 to 12 parts by weight, of matrix particles.<br>
The perfume component can consist of one or more, preferably 20 to 60, fragrances. The perfume component is essentially insoluble in water.<br>
Examples of fragrances for the care agents according to the invention are given, for example, in S. Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Materials, Vol. I and II, Montclair, N. J., 1969, published privately, or K. Bauer, D. Garbe and H. Surburg, Common Fragrance and Flavor Materials, 3rd. Ed., Wiley-VCH, Weinheim 1997.<br>

The care agents according to the invention generally comprise 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.5 to 2 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.8 to 1.2 parts by weight, of the perfume component.<br>
The care agents according to the invention further comprise a washing-active surfactant component. The washing-active surfactant component can consist of one or more, preferably 3 to 5, surfactants.<br>
Washing-active surfactants for the care agents according to the invention are known per se (Andreas Domsch, Die kosmetischen Praparate, Band II [Cosmetic Preparations, Volume II]).<br>
By way of example, mention may be made of the following washing-active surfactants.<br>
Anionic surfactants<br>
This class of substance includes secondary alkanesulphonates, e.g. Sodium CH-H alkyl Sec Sulphonate, alkyl sulphates e.g. Sodium Lauryl Sulphate, alkyl ether sulphates, lauryl ether sulphates e.g. Sodium Laureth Sulphate, olefmsulphonates, e.g. Sodium Olefm C14-i6 Sulphonate, alkylamide ether sulphates, e.g. TEA-PEG-3 Cocamide Sulphate, acyl isethionates e.g. Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, acyl glutamates e.g. Lauroyl Glutamate, alkyl ether carboxylates e.g. Trideceth-7 Carboxylic Acid, methyl taurides e.g. Sodium Lauroyl Taurate, sarcosides, e.g. Ammonium Cocoyl Sarcosinate, sulphosuccinates, e.g. Disodium PEG-4 Cocamido MIPA-Sulphosuccinate, protein fatty acid condensates e.g. Potassium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants<br>
This class of substance includes alkylbetaines, e.g. Lauryl Betaine, alkyl-amidobetaines e.g. Cocamidopropyl Betaine, sulphobetaines e.g. Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, acetates and diacetates, e.g. Disodium Cocoamphodiacetate, imidazolines, e.g. Amphonyl, propionates. e.g. Sodium Cocoamphopropionate.<br>
Nonionic surfactants<br>
This class of substance includes ethoxylated castor oil derivatives, e.g. PEG-20 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, polysorbates, e.g. Polysorbate 80, glycerol fatty acid ester ethoxylates, e.g. PEG 20 Glyceryl Isostearate, sugar surfactants, e.g. capryl/caprylyl glucosides, amine oxides, e.g. Cocamine Oxide.<br>
The care agents according to the invention generally comprise 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, particularly preferably 5 to 10 parts by weight, of the washing-active surfactant component.<br>
The care agents according to the invention comprise water as further component.<br>
Furthermore, the care agents according to the invention can also comprise electrolytes.<br>
Examples of electrolytes for the care agents according to the invention which may be mentioned are: sodium chloride, ammonium chloride and magnesium chloride.<br>
The care agents according to the invention can generally comprise 0.1 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 0.3 to 3 parts by weight, particularly preferably 0.5 to 2 parts by weight, of electrolytes.<br>
The care agents according to the invention can be prepared as follows:<br>
The gellan gum is dissolved in water at about 70°C, then cooled to about 55°C, and the perfume component is added. The solution is homogenized using a high-speed stirrer and cooled to about 45°C with stirring. The solution is stirred throughout the entire preparation. A dosing pump is used to pump the solution into an ice-cooled aqueous calcium bath with a calcium ion concentration of about 6 mmol.<br>
The washed matrix particles are added to the surfactant formulation.<br>
The care agents prepared by this process consist of matrix particles with a spherical diameter of from 3 to 5 mm. The shape of the particles is uniformly round. The particles have an average degree of hardness and can be destroyed without targeted mechanical action, as arises, for example, during the showering or washing operation.<br>
The care agents according to the invention can be used in the field of body-cleansing and in technical cleaners, e.g. household cleaners.<br>
Surprisingly, the care agents according to the invention based on matrix particles have a high retention behaviour for (surfactant components), perfume oils and other active ingredients.<br>
It is readily possible to also add solid components, for example, colour pigments, to the matrix particles.<br>
One advantage of the care agents according to the invention based on matrix particles is their simple formulation make-up and an uncomplicated preparation process. The uncomplicated arrangement of apparatus can therefore be transferred easily to production scale.<br>
The invention displays the following further unexpected advantages:<br>
Care agents with the matrix particles according to the invention do not tend toward "bleeding" of the filling material<br>
Care agents based on the matrix particles have high odour stability in surfactant systems<br>
Care agents based on the matrix particles have high chemical stability and adhesive effect<br>
The care agents according to the invention based on matrix particles permit a targeted use of the surfactant and perfume components and do not have a negative impact on the environment as a result of a high concentration.<br>
