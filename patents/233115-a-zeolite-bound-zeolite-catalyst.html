				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to zeolite bound zeolite catalyst which can be<br>
tailored to optimize its performance and the use of the zeolite bound<br>
zeolite catalyst for hydrocarbon conversion processes^<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE: INVENTION.<br>
Crystalline mieroporous molecular sieves, both natural iind synthetic,<br>
have been demonstrated to have catalytic properties for various types<br>
of hydrocarbon conversion processes. In addition, the crystalline<br>
rnicroporous molecular sieves have been used as adsorbents: and<br>
catalyst carriers for various types of hydrocarbon conversion processes,<br>
and other applications. These molecular sieves are ordered., porous,<br>
crystalline material having a definite crystalline structure as<br>
determined by x-ray diffraction, within which there are a large number<br>
of smaller cavities which may be interconnected by a number of still<br>
smsJler channels or pores. The dimensions of these channels or pores<br>
are such as to allow for adsorption of molecules with certain<br>
dimensions while rejecting those of large dimensions. The interstitial<br>
spaces or channels formed by the crystalline network enable molecular<br>
sieves such as crystalline silicates, aluminosilicates, crystalline<br>
silieoalumino phosphates, and crystalline aluminophosphates, to be<br>
used as molecular sieves in separation processes and catalysts and<br>
catalyst supports in a ivied 'variety of hydrocarbon conversion<br>
processes.<br>
Within a pore of the crystalline molecular sieve, hydrocarbon<br>
conversion reactions such as paraffin isomerization, olefin skeletal or<br>
double bond isomerization, disproportionation, alleviation, and<br>
trans alkylation of aroinatics are governed by constraints imposed by<br>
the channel size of the molecular sieve. Reactant selectivity occurs<br>
when a fraction of the feedstock is too large to enter the pores to react;<br>
while product selectivity occurs when some of the products can not<br>
leave the channels or do not; subsequently react. Product distributions<br>
can also be altered by transition state selectivity in which certain<br>
reactions can not occur becatise the reaction transition state is too<br>
large to form within the pores. Selectivity can also result from<br>
configuration constraints on diffusion where the dimensions of the<br>
molecule approach that of the pore system. Non-selective reactions on<br>
the surface of the molecular sieve, such reactions on the surface acid<br>
sites of the molecular sieve, are generally not desirable as such<br>
reactions are not subject to the shape selective constraints imposed on<br>
those reactions occurring within the channels of the molecular sieve.<br>
Zeolites are comprised of a lattice silica and optionally alumina<br>
combined with exchangeable cations such as alkali or alkaline earth<br>
metal ions, Although the term "zeolites" includes materials containing<br>
silica and optionally alumina, it is recognized that the silica and<br>
alumina portions may be replaced in whole or in part with other<br>
oxides. For example, germanium oxide, tin oxide, phosphorous oxide,<br>
and mixtures thereof can replace the silica portion. Boron oxide, iron<br>
oxide, gallium oxide, indium oxide, and mixtures thereof can replace<br>
the alumina portion. Accordingly, the terms "zeolite"', "zeolites" and<br>
"zeolite material", as used herein, shall mean not only materials<br>
containing silicon and, optionally, aluminum atoms in the crystalline<br>
lattice; structure thereof, but also materials which contain suitable<br>
replacement atoms fox such silicon and aluminum, such as<br>
gallosilicates, aHicaalmn.mophospha.tes (SAPO) and<br>
aluminophosphates (ALPO). The term "aluminosilicate zeolite", as<br>
used herein, shall mean zeolite materi;als consisting essentially of<br>
silicon and aluminum atoms in the crystalline lattice structure thereof.<br>
Synthetic zeolites are conventionally prepared by the crystallization of<br>
zeolites from a supersaturated synthesis! mixture. The resulting<br>
crystalline product is then dried and calcined to produce a zeolite<br>
powder. Although the zeolite powder has good adsorptive properties,<br>
its practical applications are severely limited because the powder has<br>
no significant mechanical strength.<br>
Mechanical strength is conventionally conferred on the zeolite provider<br>
by forming a zeolite aggregate such as a pill, sphere, or extrudate. The<br>
extrudate can be formed by extruding the zeolite in the presence of a<br>
non-seolitic binder and drying and calcining the resulting extrudate.<br>
The "binder materials used are resistant to the temperatures and other<br>
conditions, e.g., mechanical attrition, which occur in various<br>
hydrocarbon conversion processes. It is generally necessary that the<br>
zeolite be resistant to mechanical attrition, that is, the formation of<br>
fines which are small particles, e.g., particles having a siz;e of less than<br>
20 microns. Examples of suitable binders include amorphous<br>
materials such as alumina, silica, titanium, and various types of days.<br>
Although such bound zeolite aggregates have much better mechanical<br>
strength than the zeolite powder, when the bound zeolite is used in a<br>
catalytic conversion process, the performance of the catalyst, e.g.,<br>
activity, selectivity, activity maintenance, or combinations thereof, can<br>
be reduced because of the binder. For instance, since the binder is<br>
typically present in amounts of up to about 60 wt% of zeolite, the<br>
binder dilutes the adsorptive properties of the zeolite aggregate. In<br>
addition, since the bound zeolite is prepared by extruding or otherwise<br>
forming the zeolite with the binder arid subsequently drying and<br>
calcining the extrudate, the amorphous binder can penetrate the pores<br>
of the zeolite or otherwise block access to the pores of the zeolite, or<br>
slow the rate of mass transfer to and from the pores of the zeolite<br>
which can reduce the effectiveness of the zeolite when used in<br>
hydrocarbon conversion processes and other applications.<br>
Furthermore, when a bound zeolite is used in catalytic conversions<br>
processes, the binder may affect the chemical reactions that are taking<br>
place within the zeolite and also may itself catalyse undesirable<br>
reactions which can result in the formation of undesirable products.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable that zeolite catalysts used in hydrocarbon<br>
conversion not include deleterious amounts of such binders.<br>
In certain hydrocarbon conversion processes, it is sometimes desirable<br>
that the catalyst used in the process be tailored to maximize its<br>
performance. For instance, it is sometimes desirable that the catalyst<br>
used in a hydrocarbon conversion process be a multifunctional catalyst,<br>
e.g., a bifunctional catalyst having the capability of performing two or<br>
more functions. A bifunctional catalyst comprises two separate<br>
catalysts which induce separate reactions. The reaction products can<br>
be separate or the two catalysts can be used together such that the<br>
reaction product of one catalyst is transported to and reacts on a<br>
catalyst site of the second catalyst. Also, since one of the benefits of<br>
using a zeolite catalyst is that the catalyst; is shape selective and nonselective<br>
reactions on the surface of the zeolite are usually not<br>
desirable, it :LS sometimes desirable that the catalyst used in a<br>
hydrocarbon conversion process have the capability of preventing1 or at<br>
least reducing unwanted reactions which may take place on the<br>
surface of the zeolite catalyst by selectively sieving molecules in the<br>
feedstream based on their size or shape to prevent undesirable<br>
molecules present in the feedstream from entering the catalytic phase<br>
of the zeolite catalyst and reacting with the catalyst. In addition, the<br>
performance of a zeolite catEilyst can sometimes be maximized if the<br>
catalyst selectively sieves desired molecules based on their size or<br>
shape in order to prevent the molecules from exiting the catalyst phase<br>
of the catalyst.<br>
The present invention provides a zeolite bound zeolite catalyst for use<br>
in hydrocarbon conversion processes which does not contain<br>
substantial amounts of a non-zeolitic binder and comprises core and<br>
binder zeolites that can be tailored to optimize its performance.<br>
SUMMARY.OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a zeolite bound zeolite catalyst<br>
which comprises first crystals of a first zeolite and a binder comprising<br>
second crystals of a second zeolite and the use of the zeolite bound<br>
zeolite catalyst in hydrocarbon conversion processes. The structure<br>
type of the second zeolite is different from the structure type of the first<br>
zeolite. The structure type of the first and second zeolites and their<br>
composition, e.g. catalytic activity, are preferably tailored to provide a<br>
zeolite bound zeolite catalyst having enhanced performance. For<br>
example, the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst can be tailored to be<br>
multifunctional and/or can be tailored to prevent undesirable<br>
molecules from entering or exiting the catalytic phase of the zeolite<br>
bound zeolite catalyst.<br>
The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention has<br>
application in hydrocarbon conversion processes and finds particular<br>
application in acid catalyzed reactions such as catalytic cracking,<br>
alkylation, dealkylation, disproportiona.ti.on, and transalkylation<br>
reactions. In addition, the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst system of the<br>
present invention has particular application in other hydrocarbon<br>
conversion processes where cracking is not desired which include<br>
catalyzed reactions, such, as, dehydrogenation, hydrocracking,<br>
isomeiization, dewaxing, olig'omerization., and reforming1.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a zeolite bound zeolite catalyst and<br>
a process for converting organic compounds by contacting the organic<br>
compounds under conversion conditions with the zeolite, bound zeolite<br>
*- catalyst. The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst comprises first crystals of a<br>
first zeolite and a binder comprising second crystals of a second zeolite<br>
The structure type of the second zeolite is different from the structure<br>
type of the first zeolite. The use of the second crystals of a second<br>
zeolite as a binder results in a catalyst which provides a means for<br>
controlling undesirable reactions taking place on or near the external<br>
surface of the first zeolite crystals and/or affects the mass transfer of<br>
hydrocarbon molecules to and from the pores of the first zeolite.<br>
Alternatively, the second zeolite binding cxystals, if desired, can have<br>
catalytic activity, can function as a catalyst carrier, and/or can<br>
selectively prevent undesirable molecules from entering: or exiting the<br>
pores of the first zeolite.<br>
Unlike typical zeolite catalysts used in hydrocarbon conversion<br>
processes which are normally bound with silica or alumina or other<br>
commonly used amorphous binders to enhance the mechanical<br>
strength of the zeolite, the zeolite catalyst of the present invention<br>
generally does not contain significant amounts of non-zeolitic binders.<br>
Preferably, the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst contains less than 10<br>
percent by weight, based on the weight of the first and second zeolite,<br>
of ncn-zeolitic binder, more preferably contains less than 5 percent by<br>
weight, and, most preferably, the catalyst is substantially free of nonzeolitic<br>
binder. Preferably, the second zeolite crystals bind the first<br>
zeolite crystals by adhering to the surface of the first zeolite crystals<br>
thereby forming a matrix or bridge structure which also holds the first<br>
crystals particles together. More preferably, the second zeolite<br>
particles bind the first zeolite by intergiowing so as to form a coating<br>
or partial coating on the larger first zeolite crystals and, most<br>
preferably, the second zeolite crystals bind, the first zeolite crystals by<br>
intergiowing to form an attrition resistant over-growth over the first<br>
zeolite crystals.<br>
Although the invention is not intended to be limited to any theory of<br>
operation, it is believed that one of the advantages of the zeolite bound<br>
zeolite catalyst of the present invention is obtained by the second<br>
zeolite crystals controlling the accessibility of the acid sites on the<br>
external surfaces of the first zeolite to reactants. Since the acid sites<br>
existing on the external surface of a zeolite catalyst are not shape<br>
selective, these acid sites can adversely affect reactants entering the<br>
pores of the zeolite and products exiting the pores of the zeolite. In line<br>
with this belief, since the acidity and structure type of the second<br>
zeolite can be carefully selected, the second zeolite does not<br>
significantly adversely affect the reactante exiting the pores of the first<br>
zeolite which can occur with conventionally bound zeolite catalysts and<br>
may beneficially affect the reactants exiting the pores of the first<br>
zeolite. Still further, since the second zeolite is not amorphous but,<br>
instead, is a molecular sieve, hydrocarbons may have increased access<br>
to the pores of the first zeolite during hydrocarbon conversion<br>
processes. Regardless of the theories proposed, the zeolite bound<br>
zeolite catalyst, when used in catalytic processes, has one or more of<br>
the improved properties which are disclosed herein.<br>
The terms "acidity", 'lower acidity" and "higher acidity" as applied to<br>
zeolite are known to persons skilled in the art. The acidic properties of<br>
zeolite are well known. However, with respect to the present<br>
invention, a distinction must be made between acid strength and acid<br>
site density. Acid sites of a a;eo.lite can be a Bronsted acid or a Lewis<br>
acid. The density of the acid sites and the number of acid sites are<br>
important in determining the acidity of the zeolite. Factors directly<br>
influencing the acid strength are (i) the chemical composition of the<br>
zeolite framework, i.e., .relative concentration and type of tetrahedral<br>
atoms, (ii) the concentration of the extra-framework cations and the<br>
resulting extra-framework speci.es, (iti) the local structure of the<br>
zeolite, e.g., the pore size and the location, within the crystal or<br>
at/near the surface of the zeoHto, and (iv) the pretreatment conditions<br>
and presence of co-adsorbed molecules. The amount of acidity is<br>
related to the degree of isomorphous substitution provided, however,<br>
such acidity is limited to the loss of acid sites fox a pure SiC2<br>
composition. As used herein, the terras "acidity", "lower acidity and<br>
"higher acidity" refers to the concentration of acid sites irregardless of<br>
the strength of such acid sites which am. be measured by ammonia<br>
absorption.<br>
First and second zeolites suitable for use in the zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst of the present invention include large pore si:se zeoKtes,<br>
intermediate pore size zeolites, and small pore size zeolites. These<br>
zeolites are described in "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types", eds. W. H.<br>
Meier and D.H. Olson, Butterworth-Heineman, Third Edition, 1992,<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference. A large pore zeolite<br>
generally has a pore size greater than about 7 A and includes for<br>
example LTL, VFI, MAZ, MEI, FAU, EMT, OFF, BEA, and MOR<br>
structure type zeolites (TUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature).<br>
Examples of large pore zeolites, include, for example, rna2;zite,<br>
mordenite, offretite, zeolite L, VPI-5, zeolite Y, zeolite X, omega, Beta,<br>
ZSM-3, ZSM-4, ZSM-18, and ZSM-20. .An intermediate pore size<br>
zeolite generally has a pore size from about 5A, to about 7 A and<br>
includes for esjunple, MFI, MPS, MEL, MTW, EUO, MTP, HEU, FER,<br>
arid TON structure type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite<br>
Nomenclature). Examples of intermediate pore size zeolites, include<br>
ZSM-5, ZSM-12, ZSM-22, ZSM-23,'ZSM-34, ZSM-35, ZSM-3B, ZSM-48,<br>
ZSM-50, silicalite, and silicalite 2. A small pore size zeolite generally<br>
has a pore size from about 3A to about 5.0A and includes for example,<br>
CHA3 ERI, KFI, LEV, and LTA structure type zeolites (IUPAC<br>
'Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of small pore zeolites<br>
include ZK-4, ZK-14, ZK-21, ZK-22, ZK-5, ZK-20, zeolite A, erionite,<br>
chabazite, zeolite T, gemlinite, and cHnoptilolite.<br>
Preferred first and second aeolites used in the zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst comprise compositions which have the following molar<br>
relationship:<br>
::(n) YOa,<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as titanium, boron, aluminum,<br>
iron, and/or gallium, Y is a tetravalent element such as silicon, tin,<br>
and/or germanium, and n has a value of at least 2, said value beingdependent<br>
upon the particular type of zeolite and the trivalent element<br>
present in the zeolite.<br>
When either zeolite has intermediate pore size, the zeolite preferably<br>
comprises a composition having the following molar relationship:<br>
X20a::(n) YOa,<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, ancl/or gallium, Y<br>
is a tetravalent element such as silicon, tin, and/or germanium; and n<br>
has a value greater than 10, said value being dependent upon the<br>
particular type of zeolite and the trivalent element present in the<br>
zeolite. When the first or second zeolite has a MFI structure, n is<br>
preferably greater than 20.<br>
As known to persons skilled in the art, the acidity of a zeolite can be<br>
reduced using many techniques such as by dealuinination and<br>
steaming. In siddition, the acidity of a zeolite is dependent upon the<br>
form of the zeolite with the hydrogen form having the highest acidity<br>
and other forms of the zeolite such as the sodium form having less<br>
acidity than the acid form. Accordingly., the mole ratios of silica to<br>
alumina and silica to gallia disclosed herein shall include not only<br>
zeolites having the disclosed mole ratios, but shall also. include zeolites<br>
not having the disclosed mole ratios but having equivalent catalytic<br>
activity.<br>
When the first zeolite is a gallium silicate intermediates pore size<br>
zeolite, the zeolite preferably comprises a composition having the<br>
following molaa* relationship:<br>
wherein y is between about 24 and aboiit 500. The zeolite framework<br>
may contain only gallium a:ad silicon atoms or may also contain a<br>
combination of gallium., aluminum, and silicon. When the first zeolite<br>
is a MFI structure type gallium silicate zeolite, the second zeolite will<br>
preferably be an intermediate pore size zeolite having a silica to gallia<br>
mole ratio greater than 100. The second zeolite can also have higher<br>
silica to gallia mole ratios, e.g., greater than 200, 500, 1000, etc.<br>
When the first zeolite used in the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst is an<br>
aluminosilicate zeolite, the silica to alumina mole ratio will usually<br>
depend upon the structure type of the first zeolite and the particular<br>
hydrocarbon process in which the catalyst system is utilized and is<br>
therefore not limited to any particular ratio. Generally, however, and<br>
depending on. the structure type of the zeolite, the first zeolite will have<br>
a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 2: 1 and .in some instances from<br>
4:1 to about 7:1. For a number of zeolites, especially intermediate pore<br>
size zeolites, the silica to alumina mole ratio will be in the range of<br>
from about 10:1 to about 1,000:1. When the catalyst is utilised in acid<br>
catalyzed reactions such as cracking, the manufacture of paraxylene<br>
and benzene by the disproportionation of toluene, the alkylation of<br>
benzene or the like, the zeolite will be acidic and will preferably, when<br>
it is an intermediate pore siie zeolite, have higher silica to alumina<br>
mole ratios, e.g., 20:1 to about 200:1. If the catalyst system is utilized<br>
in a 8 where acid catalyzed reactions may not desired, such as a<br>
the reforming of naphtha, the second zeolite will preferably exhibit,<br>
reduced acid activity.<br>
The structure type of the first zeolite will depend on the particular<br>
hydrocarbon process in which the zeolite catalyst system is utilized.<br>
For instance, if the catalyst system is used for the reforming of<br>
naphtha to aromatics, the zeolite type will preferably be LTL (exsimple<br>
Zeolite L) and have a silica to alumina ratio from. 4:1 to about 7:1. If<br>
the catalyst system is be used for xylene isomerization or the<br>
manufacture of paraxylene and benzene by the disproportionation of<br>
toluene, the first zeolite will preferably be an intermediate ports size<br>
zeolite, such ELS a MFI structure type (example ZSM-5). If the zeolite<br>
catalyst system is to be used for cracking paraffins, the preferred pore<br>
size and structure type will depend on the size of the molecules to be<br>
cracked and the desired product. The selection of the structure type for<br>
hydrocarbon conversion processes is known to persons skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
The term "average particle size" as used herein, means the arithmetic<br>
average of the diameter distribution of the crystals on a volume basis.<br>
The average particle size of the crystals of the frcst zeolite is preferably<br>
from, about 0.1 to about 15 microns. In some applications, the average<br>
particle size will preferably be at least about 1 to about 6 microns. In<br>
other applications such as the cracking of hydrocarbons, the preferred<br>
average particle size will be from about 0.1 to about 3.0 microns.<br>
The second zeolite will have a structure type that is different from the<br>
first zeolite. 'The structure tj'pe of the second zeolite will depend on the<br>
intended use of the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst. For instance, if the<br>
zeolite bound zeolite catalyst is utilized as an<br>
isomerization/ethylbenaene dealkylation catalyst, the first zeolite is<br>
preferably selected such that the dealkylation of the ethylbenzene will<br>
occur at the catalytic phase of the first zeolite, and xylene<br>
isomerization would primarily occur at the catalytic phase of the<br>
second zeolite. If the catalyst is to be utilized in a cracking process, the<br>
second zeolite will preferably, have acid activity and the structure type<br>
can be selected such that its pore size allows into its channels the<br>
larger molecules where they are subject to cracking into small<br>
products. After the larger molecules are cracked by the second zeolite,<br>
the cracked molecules can then enter the smaller pores of a first zeolite<br>
where they can be subject to further cracking, isomemzation, or<br>
oligimerization depending on the desired resulting product.<br>
Alternatively, the pore size of the second zeolite can be smaller than<br>
the pore size of the first zeolite. In this embodiment, the large<br>
molecules enter the pores of the first zeolite where they are subject to<br>
cracking and then the cracked molecules enter the pores of the second<br>
,r zeolite where they can be subject to further conversion. The catalyst<br>
can also be tailored so that the second zeolite crystals sieve feed<br>
components entering the pores of the first zeolite or sieve product<br>
components exiting the channels of the first zeolite. For instance, if<br>
the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention comprises an<br>
appropriate pore size second zeolite, it can function to sieve and sort<br>
out molecules based on their size or shape and thereby prevent<br>
undesirable molecules f com entering or exiting, as the case may be., the<br>
catalytic phase of the first zeolite.<br>
When the second zeolite is aluminosilicate zeolite, the silica to alumina<br>
mole ratio of the second zeolite, will usually depend upon the structure<br>
type of the second zeolite and particular hydrocarbon process in which<br>
the catalyst is utilized and is therefore not limited to any particular<br>
ratio. Generally, however, and depending on the structure type of the<br>
zeolite, the silica to alumina ratio •will be at least 2:1. In applications<br>
where the aluminosilicate zeolite is an intermediate pore size zeolite<br>
and low acidity is desired, the second zeolite preferably has a silica to<br>
alumina mole ratio greater than the silica to alumina mole ratio of the<br>
first zeolite, and more preferably is greater than 200:1. The second<br>
zeolite can also have higher silica to alumina mole ratios, e.g., 300:1,<br>
500:1, 1,000:1, etc. In certain applications, the second zeolite can be a<br>
Silicalite i.e.} the second zeolite is a MFI structure type substantially<br>
free of alumina or Silicalite 2, i.e., the second zeolite is a MEL<br>
structure types substantially free of alumina. The pore size of the<br>
second zeolite will preferably be a pore size that does, not adversely<br>
restrict access of the desired molecules of the hydrocarbon feedstream.<br>
to the catalytic phase of the first zeolite. For instance, when the<br>
materials of the feedstream which are to be converted by the first<br>
zeolite have a size from 5A to 6.8A, the second zeolite will preferably be<br>
large pore zeolite or an intermediate pore size zeolite.<br>
The second zieolite is usually present in the zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst in an amount in the range of from about 10 to about 60 % by<br>
weight based on the weight of the first zeolite but the amount of second<br>
zeolite present will usually depend on the hydrocarbon process in<br>
which the catalyst is utilized. More preferably the amount of second<br>
zeolite present is from about 20 to about 50% by weight.<br>
The second zeolite crystals preferably have a smaller size than the first<br>
zeolite crystals. The second zeolite crystals preferably have an average<br>
particle size of less than 1 micron, preferably from about 0.1 to less<br>
than 0.5 micron. The second zeolite crystals, in addition to binding the<br>
first zeolite particles and maximizing the performance of the catalyst<br>
will preferably inter/grow and to form an over-growth which coats or<br>
partially coats the first zeolite. Preferably, the coating will be<br>
resistant to attrition.<br>
The zeolite bound ze.olite catalyst is preferably prepared by a three<br>
step procedure. The first step involves the synthesis of the i&amp;rst zeolite<br>
core crystals. Processes for preparing the first zeolite aire known to<br>
persons skilled in the art. For example, with respect to the<br>
preparation of a MFI structure type, such as ZSM-5, a preferred<br>
process compnses preparing a solution containing tetrapropyl<br>
ammonium hydroxide or bxomide, alkali metal oxide, an oxide of<br>
aluminum, an oxide of silicon and water, heating the reaction mixture<br>
to a temperature of 80°C to 200°C for a period of from about four hours<br>
to eight days. The resulting gel forms solid crystal particles which are<br>
separated from the reaction medium, washed with water and dried.<br>
The resulting product can be calcined in air at temperatures of 400-<br>
550°C for a period of 10-40 hours to remove tetrapropylammonium<br>
(TPA) cations.<br>
Next, a silica-bound zeolite is prepared preferabty by mixing a mixture<br>
comprising the zeolite crystals, a silica gel or sol, water and optionally<br>
an extrusion aid until a homogeneous composition in the form of an<br>
extruilable paste develops. The silica binder used in preparing the<br>
silica bound zeolite aggregate is preferably a silica sol and can contain<br>
various amounts of tiivalent metal oxides such as alumina. The<br>
amount of zeolite in the dried extrudate at this stage will preferably<br>
range from about 40 to 90% by weight, more preferably from about 50<br>
to 80% by weight, with the balance being primarily silica,, e.g. about 20<br>
to 50% by weight silica..<br>
The resulting paste is then molded, e.g. extruded, and cut into small<br>
strands, e.g., 2 mm diameter extrudates, which are dried at 100-150°C<br>
for a period of 4-12 hours and then calcined in air at a temperature of<br>
from about 400°C to 550°C for a period of from about 1 to 10 hours.<br>
Optionally, the silica-bound aggregate can be made into a very small<br>
particles which have application in fluid bed processes such, as<br>
catalytic cracking. This preferably involves mixing the zeolite with a<br>
silica containing matrix: solution so that an aqueous solution of zeolite<br>
and silica binder is formed which can be sprayed dried to result in<br>
small, fluidizable silica-bound aggregate particles. Procedures for<br>
preparing such aggregate particles are known to persons skilled in the<br>
art. An example of such, a procedure is described by Scherzer (Octane-<br>
Enhancing Zeolitic FCC Catalysts, Julius Scherzer, Miarcel Dekker,<br>
Inc. New York, 1990). The fluidizable silica-bound aggregate particles,<br>
like the silica bound extrudates described above, would then undergo<br>
the final step described below to convert the silica binder to a second<br>
zeolite.<br>
The final step in the thiee step catalyst preparation process is the<br>
conversion of the silica present in the silica-bound zeolite to a second<br>
zeolir;e having a structure type different from the first zeolite. The<br>
crystals of the second zeolite bind the first zeolite crystals together.<br>
The first zeolite crystals are thus held together without the use of a<br>
significant amount of non-zeolite binder.<br>
To prepare this zeolite bound zeolite, the silica-bound aggregate is<br>
preferably first aged in an appropriate aqueous solution at elevated<br>
temperature. Next, the contents of the solution and the temperature at<br>
which the aggregate is aged are selected to convert the .amorphous<br>
silica binder into the desired second zeolite. The newly-formed second<br>
zeolite is produced as crystals. The crystals may grow on arid/or<br>
adhere to the first zeolite crystals, and may also be produced in. the<br>
form of new intergrown crystals, which are generally much smaller<br>
than the initial crystals, e.g., of sub-micron size. These newly formed<br>
crystals may grow together and interconnect.<br>
The nature of the zeolite formed in the secondary synthesis conversion<br>
of the silica to zeolite may vary as a function of the composition of the<br>
secondary synthesis solution and synthesis aging conditions. The<br>
secondary synthesis solution is preferably an aqueous ionic solution<br>
containing a source of hydroxy ions sufficient to convert the silica to<br>
the desired zeolite. It is important, however, that the aging solution be<br>
of a composition which will not cause the silica present in the bound<br>
zeolite extrudate to dissolve out of the extrudate.<br>
The first and second zeolites may be further ion exchanged as is known<br>
in the art either to replace at least in part; the original metals present<br>
in the zeolite with a different cation, e.g. a Group IB to VIII of the<br>
Periodic Table metal such, as nickel, copper, zinc, calcivun or rare earth.<br>
metal, or to provide a more acidic form of the zeolite by exchange of<br>
alkali metal with intermediate ammonium, followed by calcination of<br>
the ammonium form to provide the acidic: hydrogen form. The acidic<br>
form may be readily prepared by ion exchange using a suitable acidic<br>
reagent such as ammonium nitrate. The zeolite catalyst may then be<br>
calcined at a temperature of 4QO-550°G for a period of 10-45 hours to<br>
remove ammonia and form the acidic hydrogen form. Ion exchange is<br>
preferably conducted aifter formation of the zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst. Particularly preferred cations are those which render the<br>
material catalytically active, especially for certain hydrocarbon<br>
conversion reactions. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals, and<br>
metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IVA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, and. VIII of the<br>
Periodic Table of the Elements. For some hydrocarbon conversion<br>
processes, the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst will contain a catalytically<br>
active metal such as at least one Group VIII metal, such as for<br>
example, platinum, palladium, rhodium, osmium, indium, and<br>
rvithenium.<br>
The zeolite catalyst systems of the present invention, can be used in<br>
processing hydrocarbon feedstocks. Hydrocarbon feed-stocks contain<br>
carbon compounds and can be from many different sources, such as<br>
virgin petroleum fractions, recycle petroleum fractions, tar sand oil,<br>
and, in general, can be any carbon containing fluid susceptible to<br>
zeolitic catalytic reactions. Depending on the type of processing the<br>
hydrocarbon feed is to undergo, the feed can contain metal or can be<br>
free of metals. Also, the feed can also have high or low nitrogen or<br>
sulfur impurities.<br>
The conversion of hydrocarbon feeds can take place in any convenient<br>
mode, for example, in fluidized bed, moving bed, or fixed bed reactors<br>
depending on the types of process desired.<br>
Since the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention has<br>
controlled acidity, does not contain a conventional binder which can<br>
adversely affect the access arid/or contact of reactants to and with the<br>
active sites of the catalyst and can also cause undesirable side<br>
reactions to occur, and if desired, can be tailored to maximize its<br>
performance, the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention<br>
by itaelf or in combination with one or more catalytically active<br>
substances can be used as a catalyst or support for a variety of organic,<br>
e.g., hydrocarbon compound, conversion processes. Examples of such<br>

hr1 to about 2,000 hr1.<br>
Although many hydrocarbon conversion processes prefer thai; the<br>
second zeolite crystals have lower acidity to reduce undesirable<br>
reactions external to the first zeolite crystals, some processes prefer<br>
that the second zeolite crystals have higher acidity, e.g., cracking<br>
reactions.<br>
Processes thai: find particular application using the zeolite bound<br>
zeolite catalyst of the present invention are those where two or more<br>
reactions are taking place within the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst.<br>
This catalyst would comprise two different zeolites that are each<br>
separately tailored to promote or inhibit different reactions. A process<br>
using such a catalyst benefits not only from greater apparent catalyst<br>
activity, greater zeolite accessibility, and reduced non-selective surface<br>
acidity possible; with zeolite bound zeolites, but from a tailored catalyst<br>
system.<br>
Examples of zeolite bound zeolite catalysts and exemplary uses are<br>
shown below in Table 1.<br>
Examples of preferred zeolite bound, zeolite catalyst systems include<br>
the following:<br>
1. A zeolite bound zeolite catalyst system comprising an<br>
acidic second seolite having cracking activity and an<br>
acidic first zeolite having acidic activity which is less than<br>
the acidic activity of the second zeolite and a smaller pore<br>
size than, the second zeolite. The zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst system finds particular application in cracking<br>
larger size molecules and isomerizing the smaller cracked<br>
molecules. Examples of suitable second zeolites include<br>
Beta, Mordenite and the like. Examples of suitable* first<br>
zeolites are ZSM-5, ZK-5, ZSM-11 and the like,<br>
2. A zeolite bound zeolite catalyst system comprising an<br>
acidic first zeolite having a large or medium pore zeolite<br>
with cracking activity and an acidic second zeolite having<br>
smaller pore size than the second zeolite and having<br>
cracking activity. An example of a suitable first zeolite<br>
ZSM-5 and an example of a suitable second zeolite isi ZK-<br>
5. The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst system finds<br>
particular application in cracking larger size molecules<br>
and further cracking the smaller cracked molecules to<br>
produce ethylene.<br>
3. A zeolite catalyst system comprising one zeolite (either<br>
the first or second zeolite) that has reduced acid activity<br>
and option alls'1 contains a hydrogenation/dehydrogenation<br>
metal and another zeolite which has medium strength<br>
acidic activity and optionally a hydrogenation/<br>
dehydrogenation metal. The pore size of the zeolites will<br>
depend upon the type of process in which the catalyst<br>
system is utilized. For example, the catalyst system can<br>
be utilized in a combined xylene isomerization/<br>
ethylbenzene dealkylation process wherein the<br>
etliylbenzene is dealkylated to benzene and ethane and<br>
isomers of xylenes are isomemedto equilibrium amounts.<br>
In such a system, the first zeolite will preferably have a<br>
large or intermediate pore size zeolite and the second<br>
zeolite will also preferably have a larger or intermediate<br>
pore size zeolite.<br>
4. A zeolite bound zeolite catalyst comprising: a first acidic<br>
zeolite and a second zeolite which has little or no acidic<br>
activity. The pore size of the zeolites will depend on the<br>
type of process in which the catalyst is utilized. For<br>
example, if the catalyst is to be used in the manufacture<br>
of benzene and paraxylene by the disproportionation of<br>
toluene, the first zeolite will preferably have an<br>
intermediate pore size and the second zeolite can be<br>
selected to enhance performance of the first zeolite, e.g., to<br>
sieve undesired molecules either leaving the first zeolite<br>
phase or exiting the first zeolite phase, as the case may be<br>
or to control accessibility of the acid sites on the external<br>
surfaces of its first zeolite to reactants. Catalysts A and D<br>
in Table I are examples of such a catalyst.<br>
The zeolite-bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention has<br>
particular application in the vapor phase disproportionaticin of toluene.<br>
Such vapor phase disproportionation comprises contacting- toluene<br>
under disproportionation conditions with the zeolite bound zeolite<br>
catalyst to yield a product mixture which comprises a mixture of<br>
unreacted (unconverted.) toluene, benzene and xylene. In the more<br>
preferred embodiment, the catalyst is first selectivated prior to use in<br>
the disproportionation process to enhance conversion of toluene to<br>
xylene and to maximize the catalyst selectivity towards the production<br>
of paraxylene. Processes for selectivating the catalyst axe known to<br>
persons skilled, in the art. For instance, selectivation may .be<br>
accomplished by exposing the catalyst in a reactor bed to a thermally<br>
decomposable organic compound, e.g. toluene, at a temperature in<br>
excess of the decomposition temperature of said compound, e.g. from<br>
about 480°C to about 650°C, more preferably 640°C to about 650°C, at<br>
a WHSV in the range of from about 0.1 to 20 Ibs of feed per pound of<br>
catalyst per hour, at a pressure in the range of from about 1 to 100<br>
atmospheres, and in the presence of 0 to about 2 moles of hydrogen,<br>
more preferably from about 0.1 to about 2 moles of hydrogen per mole<br>
of organic compound, and optionally in the presence of 0-10 moles of<br>
nitrogen or another inert gas per mole of organic compound. This<br>
process is conducted for a period of time until a sufficient quantity of<br>
coke has been deposited on the catalyst surface, generally at least<br>
about 2% by weight and more preferably from about 8 to about 40% by<br>
weight of col:e. In a preferred embodiment, such a selectivation<br>
process is conducted in the presence of hydrogen in order to prevent<br>
rampant formation of coke on the catalyst<br>
Selectivation of the catalyst can also be accomplished by treating the<br>
catalyst with a selectivation agent such ELS an organosilicon compound.<br>
Examples of organosilicon compounds include polysiloxane including<br>
siliccines, a siloxane, and a silane including disilanes and<br>
alkoxysilanes.<br>
Silicone compounds that find particular application can be represented<br>
by the formula:<br>
wherein Ei is hydrogen, fluoride, hydi'oxy, alkyl, aralkyl, alkaryl or<br>
fhioro-alkyl. The hydrocarbon substituents generally contain from 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms and preferably are methyl or ethyl groups. Rs, is<br>
selected from the same group as Hi, and n is an integer of at least 2<br>
and generally in tlie raxigo of 2 to 1000. THe moloculaj.? w<eight of the></eight>
siHcone compound employed is generally between 80 and 20,000' and<br>
preferably 150 to 10,000. Representative silicone compounds included<br>
dimethylsilicone, diethylsilicone, phenylmethylsilieone, methyl<br>
hydrogensilicone, ethylhydrogensilicone, phenylhydrogensiucone,<br>

Wherin used the vapor phase disproportionation of toluene, the cat;alyst<br>
can comprise a first phase of particles of MFI-type zeolite crystals<br>
having a micron average particle size from about 2 to about 6, a silica<br>
to alumina mole ratio offrom about 20 to about 200:1, preferably, 25:1<br>
to a.bout 120:1, having adhered structurally to the surfaces thereof<br>
particles of a second MEL-type zeolite binder phase having: an average<br>
/<br>
particle size of less than about 0.1 micron and having a alumina to<br>
silica mole ratio in excess of about 200:1 to about 10,000:1 and most<br>
preferably greater than 500:1 including Silicalite 2.<br>
Once the catalyst has been selectivated to the desired degree, reactor<br>
selectivation conditions are changed to disproportionation conditions.<br>
Disproportionation conditions include a temperature between about<br>
400°C and B50°C, more preferably between about 425°C and 510°C, at<br>
a hyiirogen to toluene mole ratio of from 0 to about 10, preferably<br>
between about 0.1 and 5 and. more preferably from about 0.1 to 1, at a<br>
pressure between about 1 atmosphere and 100 atmospheres and<br>
utilizing WHSV of between about 0.5 and 50<br>
The disproportionation process may be conducted as a batch, semicontinuous<br>
or continuous operation using a fixed o:: moving bed<br>
catalyst system, deposited in a reactor bed. The catalyst may be<br>
regenerated after coke deacti.vati.on by burning off the coke to a desired<br>
extent in an oxygen-containing atmosphere at elevated temperatures<br>
as know in the art.<br>
The zeolite bound zeolite of the present invention also finds particular<br>
application as a catalyst in, a process for isomerizini; one or more<br>
xylexie isomers in a Cs aromatic feed to obtain ortho-, meta-, and paraxylene<br>
in a ra.tio approaching the equilibrium value. In particular,<br>
xylene isomerization is used in conjunction with a separation process<br>
to manufacture para-xylene. For example, a portion of the para-xylene<br>
in a mixed C,3 aromatics stream may be recovered using processes<br>
known in the art, e.g., crystallization, adsorption, etc. The resulting<br>
stream is then reacted under xylene isomerization conditions to restore<br>
ortho-, meta-, and paraxylenes to a near equilibrium ratio.<br>
Ethylbenzene in the feed is either removed from the stream or is<br>
converted during the process to xylenes or to benzene which are easily<br>
separated by distillation. The isomerate is blended with fresh feed and<br>
the combined stream is distilled to remove heavy and light; byproducts.<br>
The resultant Cs aromatics stream is then recycled to repeat<br>
the cycle.<br>
It is important that xylene isomemation catalysts produ.ce a near<br>
equilibrium mixture of xylenes and it is also usually desirable that; the<br>
catalyst convert ethylbenzene with very little net loss of ?:ylenes. The<br>
zeolite bound zeolite catalyst finds particular application in this<br>
regard. The silica to alximina, mole ratios of the first zeolite and second<br>
zeolite can be selected to balance xylene isomerization and<br>
ethylbenzene dealkylation while minimizing undesirable side<br>
reactions. Accordingly, the zeolite catalyst of the present invention<br>
finds particular application in a hydrocarbon conversion process which<br>
comprises contacting a Cs aromatic stream containing one or more<br>
xylene isomers or ethylbenzene or a mixture thereof/ under<br>
isomerization conditions with the zeolite bound zeolite catalyst.<br>
Preferably, at least 30% of the ethylbenzene is converted.<br>
In the vapor phase, suitable isomerization conditions include a<br>
temperature in the range 250°C - 600°C;1 preferably 300°C - 550°C, a<br>
pressure in the range 0.5 - 50 atm aba, preferably 10-25 atm abs, and<br>
a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.1 to 100, preferably 0.5 to<br>
50. Optionally, isomerization in the vapor phase is conducted in the<br>
presence of 3.0 to 30.0 moles of hydrogen per mole of alkylbenzene. If<br>
hydrogen is used, the metal components of the catalyst preferably<br>
include 0.1 to 2.0 wt% of a hydrogenation/dehydrogenation component<br>
selected from Group VIII of the Periodic Table of Elements, especially<br>
platinum, palladium, or nickel. By Group VIII metal component, it is<br>
meant the metals and their compounds such as oxides and sulfides.<br>
In the liquid phase, suitable isomerization conditions include a<br>
temperature in the range 150°C - 375°C, a pressure in the range 1 -<br>
200 atm abs, and a WHSV in the range 0.5 - 50. Optionally, the<br>
isomerization feed may contain 10 to 90 wt% of a diluent such as<br>
toluene, trunethylbenssenes, naphthenes, or paraffins.<br>
The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention are<br>
especially useful as a catalyst in a process for cracking a :tia.phtha feed,<br>
e.g., C4+ naphtha feed, particularly a C.t' 290°C naphtha feed to produce<br>
low molecular weight olefins, e.g., Ca through C4 olefins, particularly<br>
ethylene and propylene. Such a process is preferably carried out by<br>
contacting the naphtha feed at temperatures ranging from 500"C to<br>
about 750eC, more preferably 650°C to 675°C, at a pressure from<br>
subatmospherlc up to 10 atmospheres, but preferably from about 1<br>
atmosphere to about 3 atmospheres.<br>
The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst of the present invention is especially<br>
useful as a catalyst in the transalkylation of polyalkylaromatic<br>
hydrocarbons. Examples of suitable polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons<br>
include di-, tri-, and tetra-alkyl aromatic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
dietliylbenaene, triethylbenzene, diethylmethylbenzene<br>
(diethyltoluene), diisopropyl-benzene, triisopropylbenzene,<br>
diisopropyltoluene, dibutylbenzene, and the like. Preferred<br>
polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons are the dialkyl benzenes. Particularly<br>
preferred polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbons are diisopropylbenzene and<br>
diethylbenzene.<br>
The transalkylation process will preferably have a molar ratio of<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon, to polyalkylaromatic hydrocarbon of preferably<br>
from about 0.5:1 to about 50:1, and more preferably from about 2:1 to<br>

The seolite bound zeolite catalyst is also useful in processes for<br>
converting aromatic compounds from paraffins. Example of suitable<br>
paraffins including aliphatic hydrocarbons containing 2 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms. The hydrocarbons may be straight chain, open or cyclic and<br>
may be saturated or unsaturated. Example of hydrocarbons include<br>
propane, propylene, n-butane, n-butenes, isobutane, isobutene, and<br>
straight- and branch-chain and cyclic pentanes, pentenes, hexanes,<br>
and hexenes.<br>

200°C to abotit 700°C, a pressure of from about 0.1 atmosphere to<br>
about 60 atmospheres, a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of from<br>
about 0.1 to about 400 and a hydrogen/hydrocarbon mole ratio of from<br>
about 0 to about 20.<br>
The zeolite bound zeolite catalyst used in the aromatization process<br>
preferably comprises first crystals of an intermediate pore size zeolite<br>
such a MFI type zeolite (example ZSM-5), and second crystals of a<br>
intermediate pore size such as a MEL structure type. The catalyst<br>
preferably contains gallium, Gallium may be incorporated into the<br>
during synthesis of the zeolite or it may be exchanged or impregnated<br>
or otherwise incorporated into the zeolite after synthesis. Preferably<br>
