SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
MOBILE STATION, WIRELESS ACCESS NETWORK APPARATUS, MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM,<br>
AND INTERMITTENT RECEPTION METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention generally relates to<br>
a mobile station, a radio access network apparatus,<br>
a mobile communication system and a discontinuous<br>
reception method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In a mobile communication, a plurality of<br>
states are defined based on traffic amounts to be<br>
transmitted for the purpose of saving battery of a<br>
mobile station and improving radio resource use<br>
efficiency of a radio access network.<br>
More particularly, defined states are a<br>
dedicated channel state (CELL_DCH) in which<br>
communication is performed using a dedicated channel<br>
when a traffic amount to be transmitted is large, a<br>
common channel state (CELL_FACH) in which<br>
communication is performed using a common channel<br>
when the traffic amount to be transmitted is small,<br>
and discontinuous reception state (CELL_PCH or<br>
URA_PCH) in which paging indicator is<br>
discontinuously received when there is no traffic to<br>
be transmitted, and transition among the states<br>
takes place according to the traffic amounts to be<br>
transmitted as shown in Fig.1.<br>
For performing the state transition<br>
according to the traffic amount to be transmitted,<br>
it is necessary to switch between communication<br>
channels. In this case, for example, as shown in<br>
Fig.2, in a radio access network including a mobile<br>
station 1 and a radio access network apparatus 2, a<br><br>
-2-<br>
channel setup request signal and a channel setup<br>
response signal are necessary between the mobile<br>
station 1 and the radio access network apparatus 2.<br>
For example, an example of the channel<br>
setup request signal is described with reference to<br>
Fig.3. In this example, in a case in which a mobile<br>
station in the CELL_PCH state changes the state to<br>
the CELL_DCH state, channel setup between the mobile<br>
station 1 and the radio access network apparatus 2<br>
is described.<br>
The radio access network apparatus 2 sends<br>
paging information to the mobile station 1. The<br>
mobile station 1 reports a current cell (CELL<br>
UPDATE).<br>
Next, the radio access network apparatus 2<br>
confirms that a cell is reselected and sends a<br>
signal specifying a physical channel to be used for<br>
communication (CELL UPDATE CONFIRM).<br>
Next, the mobile station 1 reports that<br>
reconfiguration of the physical channel is completed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
However, there are following problems in<br>
the above-mentioned background art.<br>
As mentioned before, there is a problem in<br>
that control delay occurs due to channel setup<br>
process until traffic data is transmitted as a<br>
result that state transition is performed according<br>
to traffic amounts to be transmitted.<br>
In addition, there is a problem in that<br>
control load for the radio access network apparatus<br>
increases.<br>
The present invention is contrived in view<br>
of the above-mentioned problem, and an object is to<br>
provide a mobile station, a radio access network<br>
apparatus, a mobile communication system and a<br><br>
-3-<br>
discontinuous reception method that can decrease<br>
control delay.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
To solve the above-mentioned object, the<br>
mobile station of the present invention is a mobile<br>
station that establishes a shared data channel and a<br>
signaling control channel and performs bidirectional<br>
communication between the mobile station and a radio<br>
access network apparatus, and that includes, as a<br>
feature,<br>
discontinuous reception means that<br>
performs discontinuous reception using the signaling<br>
control channel when performing discontinuous<br>
reception;<br>
data presence or absence decision means<br>
that determines presence or absence of traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station when performing<br>
the discontinuous reception; and<br>
shared channel receiving means that, when<br>
it is determined that there is traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station, receives<br>
corresponding shared data channel.<br>
By configuring like this, since<br>
discontinuous reception for the signaling control<br>
channel is performed even when the state is changed<br>
to the discontinuous reception state, switching<br>
between communication channels can be made<br>
unnecessary so that control delay due to channel<br>
setting can be decreased.<br>
The radio access network apparatus of the<br>
present invention is a radio access network<br>
apparatus that establishes a shared data channel and<br>
a signaling control channel and performs<br>
bidirectional communication between a mobile station<br>
and the radio access network apparatus, and the<br>
radio access network apparatus includes, as a<br><br>
-4-<br>
feature:<br>
discontinuous reception management means<br>
that determines whether to change a state to a<br>
discontinuous reception state;<br>
discontinuous reception channel decision<br>
means that determines a discontinuous reception<br>
channel;<br>
discontinuous reception channel reporting<br>
means that reports the determined discontinuous<br>
reception channel; and<br>
scheduling means that, when transmission<br>
data arises, transmits a control signal using the<br>
determined discontinuous reception channel and that<br>
transmits traffic data using a corresponding shared<br>
data channel.<br>
By configuring like this, since data can<br>
be transmitted without performing a channel<br>
configuring procedure when transmission data arises,<br>
control load can be decreased.<br>
In addition, the mobile communication<br>
system of the present invention is a mobile<br>
communication system that establishes a shared data<br>
channel and a signaling control channel and performs<br>
bidirectional communication between a mobile station<br>
and a radio access network apparatus,<br>
the mobile station includes:<br>
discontinuous reception means that<br>
receives only the signaling control channel<br>
discontinuously when performing discontinuous<br>
reception;<br>
data presence or absence decision means<br>
that determines presence or absence of traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station when performing<br>
the discontinuous reception; and<br>
shared channel receiving means that, when<br>
it is determined that there is traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station, receives<br><br>
-5-<br>
corresponding shared data channel, and<br>
the radio access network apparatus<br>
includes:<br>
discontinuous reception management means<br>
that determines whether to change a state to a<br>
discontinuous reception state;<br>
discontinuous reception channel decision<br>
means that determines a discontinuous reception<br>
channel;<br>
discontinuous reception channel reporting<br>
means that reports the determined discontinuous<br>
reception channel; and<br>
scheduling means that, when transmission<br>
data arises, transmits a control signal using the<br>
determined discontinuous reception channel and that<br>
transmits traffic data using a corresponding shared<br>
data channel.<br>
By configuring like this, since the mobile<br>
station performs discontinuous reception of the<br>
signaling control channel even when the state is<br>
changed to the discontinuous reception state,<br>
switching between communication channels can be made<br>
unnecessary so that control delay due to channel<br>
setting can be decreased. In addition, since the<br>
radio access network apparatus can transmit data<br>
without performing a channel setup procedure when<br>
transmission data arises, control load can be<br>
decreased.<br>
In addition, the discontinuous reception<br>
method of the present invention is a discontinuous<br>
reception method in a mobile station that<br>
establishes a shared data channel and a signaling<br>
control channel and performs bidirectional<br>
communication between the mobile station and a radio<br>
access network apparatus, the method includes, as a<br>
feature:<br>
a discontinuous reception step of<br><br>
-6-<br>
performing discontinuous reception using the signal<br>
control channel when performing discontinuous<br>
reception;<br>
a data presence or absence decision step<br>
of determining presence or absence of traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station when performing<br>
the discontinuous reception; and<br>
a shared channel receiving start step of<br>
starting, when it is determined that there is<br>
traffic data addressed to the own mobile station,<br>
receiving corresponding shared data channel.<br>
By configuring like this, since the mobile<br>
station performs discontinuous reception for the<br>
signaling control channel even when the state is<br>
changed to the discontinuous reception state,<br>
switching between communication channels can be made<br>
unnecessary so that control delay due to channel<br>
setup can be decreased.<br>

According to the present invention, a<br>
mobile station, a radio access network apparatus, a<br>
mobile communication system and an discontinuous<br>
reception method that can decrease control delay can<br>
be realized.<br>

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Next, preferred embodiments for carrying<br>
out the present invention are described with<br>
reference to figures based on the following<br>
embodiments. By the way, in all figures for<br><br>
-8-<br>
explaining the embodiments, same reference symbols<br>
are used for parts having same functions, and<br>
repeated descriptions are not provided.<br>
A mobile communication system according to<br>
an embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
with reference to Fig.4.<br>
The mobile communication system includes a<br>
mobile station 100 and a radio access network<br>
apparatus 200.<br>
The mobile station 100 and the radio<br>
access network apparatus 200 performs bidirectional<br>
communication via a shared data channel and a<br>
signaling control channel.<br>
Next, a configuration of the mobile<br>
station 100 according to the present embodiment is<br>
described with reference to Fig.5.<br>
The mobile station 100 includes a data<br>
transmit and receive unit 102 as discontinuous<br>
reception means having an antenna, a data presence<br>
or absence decision unit 102 and a discontinuous<br>
reception request unit 108 each connected to the<br>
data transmit and receive unit 102, and a shared<br>
data channel demodulation unit 106, as shared data<br>
channel receiving means, connected to the data<br>
presence or absence decision unit 104.<br>
The data transmit and receive unit 102<br>
performs data transmission and reception. For<br>
example, the data transmit and receive unit 102<br>
discontinuously receives only the signaling control<br>
channel when performing discontinuous reception.<br>
The data presence or absence decision unit<br>
104 determines presence or absence of data addressed<br>
to the own mobile station 100 when receiving is<br>
performed using the signaling control channel.<br>
The shared data channel demodulation unit<br>
106 demodulates the shared data channel received at<br>
a time corresponding to the signaling control<br><br>
-9-<br>
channel when it is determined that there is the data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station. That is, when<br>
it is determined that there is traffic data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station, the shared data<br>
channel demodulation unit 106 receives a<br>
corresponding shared data channel.<br>
When continuously receiving the shared<br>
data channel, the discontinuous reception request<br>
unit 108 determines whether sate transition to<br>
discontinuous reception is necessary, and when<br>
determining that transition to discontinuous<br>
reception is necessary, the discontinuous reception<br>
request unit 108 reports information for requesting<br>
discontinuous reception to the radio access network<br>
apparatus 200 using an uplink signaling control<br>
channel.<br>
Next, the radio access network apparatus<br>
200 according to the present embodiment is described<br>
with reference to Fig.6.<br>
The radio access network apparatus 200<br>
includes a transmission unit 202, a discontinuous<br>
reception channel reporting unit 208, a shared data<br>
channel control unit 204 as scheduling means and a<br>
signaling control channel control unit 206 that are<br>
connected to the transmission unit 202, a<br>
discontinuous reception management unit 210<br>
connected to the shared data channel control unit<br>
204 and the signaling control channel control unit<br>
206, and a discontinuous reception channel decision<br>
unit 212 connected to the discontinuous reception<br>
management unit 210 and the discontinuous reception<br>
channel reporting unit 208.<br>
The discontinuous reception channel<br>
decision unit 212 manages at least one of<br>
discontinuous reception start timing, a<br>
discontinuous reception period and a discontinuous<br>
reception channel. The discontinuous reception<br><br>
-10-<br>
channel decision unit 212 determines a discontinuous<br>
reception channel of a mobile station that has<br>
changed its state to the discontinuous reception<br>
state such that the discontinuous reception channel<br>
does not overlap with other mobile stations. For<br>
example, the discontinuous reception channel<br>
decision unit 212 selects at least a part of<br>
channels of a signaling control channel as the<br>
discontinuous reception channel. In addition, the<br>
discontinuous reception channel decision unit 212<br>
stores the determined discontinuous reception<br>
channel in the discontinuous reception management<br>
unit 210.<br>
The discontinuous reception channel<br>
reporting unit 208 reports, to the mobile station,<br>
the discontinuous reception channel determined by<br>
the discontinuous reception channel decision unit<br>
212. For example, the discontinuous reception<br>
channel reporting unit 208 reports at least one of<br>
timing at which discontinuous reception is to be<br>
performed, a discontinuous reception period and a<br>
channel to be received when performing discontinuous<br>
reception.<br>
The discontinuous reception management<br>
unit 210 manages states of each mobile station, for<br>
example, manages a shared data channel reception<br>
state and a discontinuous reception state. For<br>
example, the discontinuous reception management unit<br>
210 determines whether to change the state to the<br>
discontinuous reception state. The discontinuous<br>
reception management unit 210 manages the<br>
discontinuous reception start timing and a<br>
discontinuous reception channel, and reports, to the<br>
after-mentioned signaling control channel control<br>
unit 206, timing at which the signaling control<br>
channel determined by the discontinuous reception<br>
channel decision unit 212 can be assigned to the<br><br>
-11-<br>
mobile station in the discontinuous reception state.<br>
The signaling control channel control unit<br>
206 performs scheduling based on the reported timing.<br>
The shared data channel control unit 204<br>
performs scheduling in consideration of priorities<br>
of the mobile station, data amount and the like.<br>
In the present embodiment, as shown in<br>
Fig.7, a case is described in which the radio access<br>
network apparatus 200 includes a function of a radio<br>
control apparatus and a function of a radio base<br>
station apparatus. In this case, for example, the<br>
radio control apparatus 220 is provided with the<br>
discontinuous reception management unit 210, the<br>
discontinuous reception channel decision unit 212<br>
and the discontinuous reception channel reporting<br>
unit 208, and the radio base station apparatus 230<br>
is provided with the shared data channel control<br>
unit 204 and the signaling control channel control<br>
unit 206.<br>
In addition, the radio access network<br>
apparatus 200 may be realized as the radio control<br>
apparatus 220 and the radio base station apparatus<br>
230.<br>
Next, a reception state of the mobile<br>
station 200 and reception states of the shared data<br>
channel and the signaling control channel are<br>
described with reference to Fig.8.<br>
As reception states of the mobile station<br>
100, there are a shared channel (continuous)<br>
reception state and a signaling control channel<br>
discontinuous reception state. In the mobile<br>
station 100, transition from the shared channel<br>
reception state to the signaling control channel<br>
discontinuous reception state is performed from an<br>
instruction from the radio access network apparatus<br>
200.<br>
In addition, transition from the signaling<br><br>
-12-<br>
control channel discontinuous reception state to the<br>
shared channel continuous reception state is<br>
performed when the mobile station 100 receives<br>
downlink data.<br>
When downlink data arises when the mobile<br>
station 100 is in the signaling control channel<br>
discontinuous reception state, the radio access<br>
network apparatus 200 transmits the downlink data in<br>
synchronization with the discontinuous reception<br>
timing of the mobile station.<br>
In the present embodiment, when there are<br>
receiving data or transmission data, the mobile<br>
station 200 enters in the shared data channel<br>
reception state.<br>
Next, operation of the mobile station<br>
according to the present embodiment is described<br>
with reference to Fig.9.<br>
Here, an operation flow of the mobile<br>
station 100 in the shared data channel reception<br>
state is described.<br>
The data presence or absence decision unit<br>
104 of the mobile station 100 that is in the shared<br>
data channel reception state receives the signaling<br>
control channel continuously, and checks whether an<br>
identifier of the own mobile station is included in<br>
the received signaling control channel (step S902).<br>
The identifier of the own mobile station may be<br>
directly included in the signaling control channel,<br>
or may be detected from a signal on which<br>
predetermined calculation has been preformed using<br>
the identifier of the mobile station.<br>
When the identifier of the own mobile<br>
station is not included (step S902:No), the data<br>
presence or absence decision unit 104 receives the<br>
signaling control channel of next timing. That is,<br>
the step returns back to step S902.<br>
On the other hand, when the identifier of<br><br>
-13-<br>
the own mobile station is included, the data<br>
transmit and receive unit 102 receives the shared<br>
data channel of corresponding timing (step S904).<br>
In the shared data channel reception state,<br>
when there is no data addressed to the own mobile<br>
station in either uplink or downlink for a<br>
predetermined time, the discontinuous reception<br>
channel decision unit 212 of the radio access<br>
network apparatus 200 determines that the mobile<br>
station 100 needs to change to the signaling control<br>
channel discontinuous reception state. The<br>
discontinuous reception channel reporting unit 208<br>
instructs the mobile station to change to the<br>
discontinuous reception state.<br>
In this case, for example, the shared data<br>
channel control unit 204 of the radio access network<br>
apparatus 200 performs measurement for determining<br>
presence or absence of downlink data. In addition,<br>
the discontinuous reception request unit 108 of the<br>
mobile station 100 performs measurement determining<br>
presence or absence of uplink data. For example, as<br>
a result of measurement for the presence or absence<br>
of the uplink transmission data, when there is no<br>
transmission data for a predetermined time, the<br>
discontinuous reception request unit 108 of the<br>
mobile station 100 reports that there is no<br>
transmission data to the radio access network<br>
apparatus 200.<br>
The discontinuous reception channel<br>
decision unit 212 of the radio access network<br>
apparatus 200 that receives information indicating<br>
there is no transmission data reports that the state<br>
changes to the signaling control channel<br>
discontinuous reception state via the discontinuous<br>
reception channel reporting unit 208.<br>
In the mobile station 100 that receives<br>
the instruction, state transition is performed from<br><br>
-14-<br>
the shared channel continuous reception state to the<br>
signaling control channel discontinuous reception<br>
state as shown in Fig.10.<br>
Next, operation of the mobile station 100<br>
is described with reference to Fig.11.<br>
In the following, an operation flow of the<br>
mobile station that changes to the signaling control<br>
channel discontinuous reception state is described.<br>
First, the data transmit and receive unit<br>
102 of the mobile station 100 determines whether the<br>
mobile station 100 is in the discontinuous reception<br>
state (step S1102).<br>
As shown in Fig.8, the mobile station 100<br>
in the signaling control channel discontinuous<br>
reception state receives the signaling control<br>
channel at discontinuous reception timing specified<br>
by the radio network apparatus 200.<br>
When the mobile station is not in the<br>
discontinuous reception state (Step S1102:NO), the<br>
process returns to step S1102.<br>
On the other hand, when the mobile station<br>
is in the discontinuous reception state (step<br>
S1102:Yes), and when performing discontinuous<br>
reception, the data presence or absence decision<br>
unit 104 determines whether there is data addressed<br>
to the own mobile station (step S1104) .<br>
When there is no data addressed to the own<br>
mobile station, that is, if an identifier of the own<br>
mobile station is not included in downlink<br>
transmission data when discontinuously receiving the<br>
signaling control channel (step S1104:NO), the<br>
process returns to step S1102. In this case, the<br>
state does not change to the shared data channel<br>
reception state. The mobile station 100 may receive<br>
at least a part of the signaling control channel<br>
according to an instruction of the radio access<br>
network apparatus 200.<br><br>
-15-<br>
On the other hand, when there is data<br>
addressed to the own mobile station, that is, when<br>
the identifier of the own mobile station is stored<br>
in the signaling control channel that is<br>
discontinuously received (step S1104:Yes), the<br>
mobile station receives corresponding shared data<br>
channel (step S1106). In this case, the state is<br>
changed from the signaling control channel<br>
discontinuous reception state to the shared data<br>
channel continuous reception state.<br>
An example of an operation flow of the<br>
mobile station is described with reference to Fig.12<br>
in which it changes from the signaling control<br>
channel discontinuous reception state to the shared<br>
data channel continuous reception state.<br>
The signaling control channel control unit<br>
206 of the radio access network apparatus 200<br>
performs calling using the signaling control channel<br>
(step S1202) .<br>
The mobile station 100 detects an<br>
identifier of the own mobile station, and changes to<br>
the shared data channel continuous reception state<br>
(step S1204) .<br>
The mobile station 100 starts receiving<br>
the shared data channel at predetermined timing<br>
(step S1206).<br>
According to the present embodiment,<br>
procedures for state transition and channel<br>
switching described with reference to Fig.3 are not<br>
necessary, and the radio access network apparatus<br>
200 can start transmitting downlink data right after<br>
calling the mobile station 100 using the signaling<br>
control channel, so that channel switching is<br>
unnecessary.<br>
In addition, according to the present<br>
embodiment, since switching of communication<br>
channels between the time for normal receiving and<br><br>
-16-<br>
the time for discontinuous reception, data can be<br>
directly transmitted even though transmission data<br>
arises at the time of discontinuous reception. Thus,<br>
control delay until data is received in the mobile<br>
station can be decreased. As a result, the<br>
procedure for switching communication channels<br>
becomes unnecessary so that control load of the<br>
radio access network apparatus can be decreased.<br>
In addition, since it is only necessary to<br>
discontinuously receive the signaling control<br>
channel also when changing to the discontinuous<br>
reception state, communication channel switching is<br>
not necessary. In addition, since data can be<br>
received without performing channel setting<br>
procedure even when transmission data arises,<br>
control delay until data is received and control<br>
load of the radio access network apparatus can be<br>
decreased.<br>
[Industrial applicability]<br>
The mobile station, the radio access<br>
network apparatus, the mobile communication system<br>
and the discontinuous reception method according to<br>
the present invention can be applied to mobile<br>
communication systems.<br>
