COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10,RULE 12]<br>
"PROCESS FOR " PREPARING A POLYOL<br>
HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL LLC, of 500 Huntsman Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The    present    invention    relates    to    process    for    preparing    a    polyols and    more    particularly    to    a    process    for    preparing    PIPA    polyols. PIPA polyols have been disclosed before, see e.g. US 4452923, US 4438252, US      4554306, GB 2102822, WO 94/12553.   PIPA polyols are polyaddition reaction products of a polyisocyahate and a low molecular weight compound, having a plurality of hydroxyl, primary amine and/or secondary amine groups, made in the presence of high molecular weight polyols, in particular polyether polyols.  The . PIPA polyol is a dispersion of particulate material in a polyol and is used e.g. in making   slabstock   or  moulded  flexible  foams   with  improved  load-bearing      properties.   The amount of PIPA polyol used in formulations for making such      foams conventionally is such that the amount of particulate material calculated on all high molecular weight polyol used in the formulation is 1-15% by weight. The most commonly used PIPA polyol nowadays probably is a PIPA polyol having about 20% by weight of particulate material, which is diluted with further high molecular weight polyol to the above 1 -15% by weight loading range.<br>
It would be desirable to be able to provide PIPA polyol with a considerably higher loadmg. It would allow the foam producer, to use PIPA polyol with higher . loadings for making the foam. Even if the foam producer would dilute the PIPA polyol with a higher loading, it would have the advantage that the PIPA polyol can be transported in a more concentrated form and is diluted at the place where it is needed and to the extent needed. Further it provides, the polyurethane systems" formulator with less formulation restrictions. The foams made from such PIPA polyols show good fire retardancy properties and are easily recyclable:<br>
Processes for making such PIPA polyols, with a higher loading, are known, see e.g. the prior art mentioned before. However these processes lead to products which have a high viscosity and/or are not stable or these processes lead, certainly<br>
-2-<br><br>
at a larger scale, to an uncontrollable reaction which gives PIPA polyols which could cause foam collapse when used in making flexible polyurethane foams.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found a process for making such PIPA polyols with a high content of particulate material, a low viscosity and a good stability.   .<br>
Therefore the present invention is concerned with a process for preparing a polyol comprising particulate material in dispersed form, the amount of particulate material being 30-80% by weight and preferably 40-70% by weight calculated on the total composition wherein<br>
-	an isocyanate reactive compound comprising a plurality of hydroxyl, primary amine and/or secondary amine groups and having an equivalent weight of up to 400 is emulsified in a polyol, having an equivalent weight of 1000-5000 and an average nominal hydroxy functionality of 2-6, at a temperature of 60-100°C under high shear mixing conditions,<br>
-	a polyisocyanate is added gradually to the emulsion so formed while maintaining the temperature between 60-120°C, preferably 70-110°C, and while maintaining high shear conditions,<br>
-	the reacting mixture, obtained after all polyisocyanate has been added, is allowed to react further for a period of time of 10 minutes — 2 hours, preferably 15 minutes - 1 hour, while maintaining the temperature between 60-120°C, preferably 70-M0°C,<br>
-	the high shear mixing is discontinued, and optionally<br>
-	the polyol so obtained and comprising the particulate material in an amount of 3 0-80% % weight in dispersed form is cooled to ambient temperature.<br>
In the context of the present application the following terms have the following meaning :<br>

-8 -<br><br>
The diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) used may be selected from 4,4"-MDI, 2,4"-MDI, isomeric mixtures of 4,4"-MDI and 2,4"-MDI and less than 10% by weight of 2,2"-MDI, and modified variants thereof containing carbodiimide, uretonimine, isocyanurate, urethane, allophanate, urea and/or biuret groups.

Diphenylmethane diisocyanate comprising homologues having an isocyanate functionality of 3 or more are so-called polymeric or crude MDI.<br>
Polymeric or crude MDI are well known in the art. They are made by the phosgenation of a mixture of polyamines obtained by the acid condensation of aniline and formaldehyde.<br>
The manufacture of both the polyamine mixtures and the polyisocyanate mixtures is well known. The condensation of aniline with formaldehyde in the presence of strong acids such as hydrochloric acid gives a reaction product containing diaminodiphenylmethane together with polymethylene polyphenylene polyamines of higher functionality, the precise composition depending in known manner inter alia on the aniline/formaldehyde ratio. The polyisocyanates are made by phosgenation of the polyamine mixtures and the various proportions of diamines, triamines and higher polyamines give rise to related proportions of diisocyanates, triisocyanates and higher polyisocyanates. The relative proportions of diisocyanate, triisocyanate and higher polyisoycanates in such crude or polymeric MDI compositions determine the average functionality of the compositions, that is the average<br>
-9-<br><br>
number of isocyanate groups per molecule.   By varying the proportions of starting   materials,    the   average   functionality    of   the   polysiocyanate compositions can be varied from little more than 2 to 3 or even higher.   In practice, however, the average isocyanate functionality preferably ranges from 2.3-2.8. The NCO value of such polymeric or crude MDI is at least 30% by weight. The polymeric or crude MDI contain diphenylmethane diisocyanate, the   remainder   being  polymethylene   poJyphenylene   polyisocyanates  of functionality greater than two together with by-products formed In the manufacture of such polyisocyanates by phosgenation of polyamines. Further modified variants of such crude or polymeric MDI may be used as well comprising carbodiimide, uretonimine, isocyanurate, urethane, allophanate, urea and/or biuret groups; especially the aforementioned uretonimine and/or carbodiimide modified ones and the urethane modified ones are preferred. Mixtures of polyisocyanates may be used as well.<br>
The emulsification of compound 2 in compound 1 is conducted at elevated temperature under high shear conditions. The temperature is 60-100°C, most preferably 70-95°C. The high shear mixing of compound I and 2 is conducted for a period between 10 minutes and 3 hours preferably and between 30 minutes and 21/2 hours most preferably. Those skilled in the art will be able to create high shear mixing conditions using an appropriate mixer.   Preferably the mixing is conducted in such a way that the mixing efficiency is similar to or better than the one obtained when using a Silverson HX-30 special at 500 and more revolutions per minute and more preferably at 1000 and more revolutions per minute. Compound 1 and 2 may be combined at ambient conditions and subsequently heated to the above temperature and subjected to high shear mixing.   Preferably compound 1 and optionally compound 2 is preheated.    This preheating preferably is done while high shear mixing compound 1; hence using the heat generated by the high shear mixing as well. Once the compound 1 is preheated compound 2 is added to it; optionally a small additional amount of compound 1 is added.    The addition of the<br>
-10-<br>
SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)<br><br>
polyisocyanate is gradually.     Gradually in this  context means that the<br>
polyisocyanate is added over a certain extended period of time such that the<br>
time between the first and the last addition is 1-100 hours, preferably 2-50<br>
hours,   more   preferably   2-20   hours;   preferably   the   addition   of  the<br>
polyisocyanate is conducted in such a way that at least 5% by weight of the<br>
total amount of the polyisocyanate is added during the first 10% of the time<br>
period and that at least 5% by weight of the total amount of the polyisocyanate<br>
is added during the last 10% of the time period; most preferably the addition is<br>
conducted at a constant speed (gram/minute) with a variance of 10% or less.<br>
The temperature is maintained at 60-120°C, preferably 80-110°C, while<br>
maintaining high shear conditions. Since the reaction between the ingredients<br>
is  exothermic  and  since  the  high  shear  mixing  generates  heat  some<br>
temperature control might be needed; this can be achieved by cooling or by<br>
slowing  down  or  even   interrupting  temporarily   the  flow  rate  of the<br>
polyisocyanate or a combination thereof.<br>
Once the polyisocyanate has been added the mixture is allowed to further<br>
react, while maintaining the temperature and mixing conditions for 10-120<br>
minutes and preferably 15-60 minutes.  Finally, the product according to the<br>
invention obtained is, if desired, allowed to cool to ambient temperature after<br>
high shear mixing is discontinued.   The relative amounts of compound 1,<br>
compound 2 and polyisocyanate depend on the amount of particulate material<br>
desired and on the chosen specific ingredients.    Since compound 1  and<br>
compound 2 are both reactive towards the polyisocyanate, although compound<br>
2 is more reactive than compound 1, it is preferred to use compound 2 in an<br>
amount such that the total number of isocyanate-reactive hydrogens in the<br>
amount of compound 2 to be used exceeds the total number of isocyanate<br>
groups in the amount of polyisocyanate to be used, preferably the number of<br>
isocyanate-reactive hydrogens in compound 2 is 10-200 and more preferably<br>
25-100% higher than the number of isocyanate groups.<br>
-11-<br><br>
Although a catalyst could be used, this preferably is not done. The process can be conducted batch-wise, semi-continuously or continuously. When the process is conducted batch-wise the total amount of polyol composition comprising particulate material made per batch preferably is at least 10 kg and - more preferably at least 25 kg since the advantages of the process according to the present invention are particularly noticeable when such larger batches are made. Compound 1, optionally may comprise a small amount of previously made PIPA polyol, the amount being such that the amount of particulate material is 0.1-10 preferably 0.5-5% by weight.<br>
When the aforementioned MDI, polymeric or crude MDI or the modified variants thereof are used, it was surprisingly found that the process according to the present invention leads to PIPA polyols having a low viscosity, i.e. a viscosity of 5000-25000 mPa.s at 25°C, at a high particulate material content, i.e. 40-80% by weight and preferably 40-70% by weight. Therefore the present invention is further concerned with a polyol composition comprising particulate material in dispersed form and in an amount of 40-80% by weight calculated on the total composition, this composition having a viscosity of 5000-25000 mPa.s at 25°C and the particulate material comprising reaction products of an isocyanate reactive compound comprising a plurality of hydroxyl, primary amine and/or secondary amine groups and having an equivalent weight  of up  to  400 and  of diphenylmethane  diisocyanate optionally comprising homologues thereof having and isocyanate functionality of 3 or more and/or modified variants of such polyisocyanates.  Foams made from such a PIPA polyol show a surprisingly better compression set than foams made from PIPA polyols based on toluene diisocyanate.<br>
Example<br>
Ingredients used : Daltocel F-428 (1124 kg) polyol (Daltocel is a trademark of Huntsman 1C1 Chemicals LLC; Daltocel-F-428 is a polyether polyol obtainable from Huntsman Polyurethanes); 380 kg of triethanolamine (99%<br>
-12 -<br><br>
pure, TELA) and 678 kg at Suprasec 2020 polyisocyanate (obtainable from Huntsman Polyurethanes, Suprasec is a trademark of Huntsman 1C1 Chemicals LLC).<br>
The polyol was heated to 45°C. 1000 1 of the polyol was subjected to high shear mixing and heated to 85°C. High shear mixing was stopped and the remainder of the polyol and the TELA were added separately. High shear mixing was started again and the mixture was heated to 82°C while forming the emulsion of TELA in the polyol. The time between re-starting the high shear mixing and the mixture reaching the temperature of 82°C was 45 minutes.<br>
The polyisocyanate addition was started then and the mixture was cooled such that the temperature did not exceed 100°C; the polyisocyanate was added at a speed of 1.35 liter/minute. After the polyisocyanate was added the batch was allowed to react for another 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature between 82 and 100°C. Then the high shear mixing was discontinued and the batch allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The high shear mixing was conducted with a Silverson HX-30 special at 1460 revolutions per minute. A polyol according to the present intention was obtained having about 50% by weight of particulate material dispersed therein. The viscosity of this PIPA polyol was 15000 mPa.s at 25°C.<br>
Flexible polyurethane foams have been made with this PIPA polyol; the foams showing good properties, especially load bearing properties and compression set properties.<br>
