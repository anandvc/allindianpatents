				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of smelting aluminum, scrap and remainders containing aluminum in rotary drum furnaces of the kind as defined by the preamble of claim 1 and to an apparatus for implementing the method.<br>
Aluminum, scrap and remainders containing aluminum are smelted in rotating cylindrical furnaces  so-called rotary drum furnaces, into which the material to be<br><br>
smelted is charged with the aid of a charging device at the so-called charging end. For this purpose, firstly a furnace door is swivelled open from a furnace port before charging is done and then the door is swivelled back in place on the furnace. Subsequently a burner disposed in the door is put into operation. However, due to the smelting burner being disposed in the charging door, the latter is very difficult to seal-close satisfactorily to consistently prevent the infiltration of unwanted air.<br>
The waste gases materializing during the smelting process are brought out by an exhaust duct from the furnace at the end thereof opposite to the charging door. The direction in the flow of the furnace gases and burner waste gases is thus the same and in parallel.<br>
Since however infiltrating air may enter the furnace, this method has the disadvan¬tage that due to this infiltrating air the volume of waste gas resulting from the smelting procedure and also the oxygen partial pressure in the waste gas volume are increased.<br>
If organic components such as e.g. paper, plastics, rubber, paints, etc. are present in the material to be smelted, these are pyrolysed when the volatilization temperature is attained and, when oxygen is deficient, brought out through the exhaust duct from the furnace as uncombusted hydrocarbons.<br>
The gas cleaning systems usually employed, comprising a cooler, an injection system for lime, hydrate of lime etc. to bind the acidic waste gas components and the subsequent fabric filter are not able to completely eliminate these hydrocarbons. A further disadvantage of the aforementioned method is thus the emission of hydrocarbons along with the waste air to the environment.<br>
In DE 41 15 269 Al a method of smelting metal in a furnace is described in which the metal is heated by a primary burner disposed at a first location on the furnace<br><br>
and the waste gases leave the furnace at a second location at which a secondary burner is provided to incinerate the emitted waste gases and simultaneously to also heat the metal.<br>
This method has, however, the disadvantage that a further burner additional to the primary burner needs to be employed and that due to the additional burner the volume of waste gas is increased. Furthermore, the furnace door cannot be safeguarded against infiltratation of unwanted air.<br>
From EP 0 475 128 Al a method is known in which the material to be smelted is heated up in a furnace with a firing burner, the waste gases substantially flooding from the firing burner to the exhaust duct of the furnace and gas rich in oxygen being introduced into the furnace, preferably by means of an oxygen lance or an oxygen injection burner, whereby the pulsating movement of the gas from the firing burner and that of the gas rich in oxygen are not in the same direction in parallel to each other.<br>
This method has the disadvantage that an additional device such as e.g. an oxygen lance or an oxygen injection burner needs to be provided on the furnace to introduce gas rich in oxygen thereunto. When the firing burner and oxygen injection burner are disposed at opposite ends of the furnace to achieve the opposite sense in direction of the pulsating movement of the gases, the firing burner is provided in the charging door, this being the reason why it is difficult to seal off against the ingress of infiltrating unwanted air. This results in the aforementioned disadvantage of the waste gas volume being increased.<br>
&amp;'■<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a method which does not have the above disadvantages and in particular significantly reduces the volume of waste gases resulting from smelting aluminum, scrap arid remainders containing aluminum as well as diminishing the noxious content of the waste gases and to provide an<br><br>
apparatus for conducting the method.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method ofseggiegafcing aluminium from aluminium containing waste such as scraps by smelting the same in a rotary drum furnace having only one burner disposed at the exhaust end of said rotary drum furnace wherein a charging stock is introduced into said furnace through a charging door provided on one end thereof, fuel and gas containing oxygen are introduced into said rotary drum furnace through said burner and combusted in said furnace to smelt the aluminium containing waste therein, waste gases generated are exhausted through the exhaust end located opposite to said charging door and is passed through a waste gas measuring means and on completion of smelting aluminium is removed through said charge door.<br><br>
The subclaims are aimed at expedient embodiments of the invention.<br>
The advantages achieved by the invention are based on the following mode of functioning: the burner of the rotary drum furnace is disposed at the same end as the port of the furnace for the exhaust duct and thus at the end opposite to the charging door so that the directions in the flow of the burner gases and furnace waste gases are parallel and in the opposite direction.<br>
By this positioning of the burner it is possible to eliminate the former dual function of the furnace door as charging door and support for the burner, it now exclusively being employed as the charging door. Accordingly, the door can now be configured seal-closing and thus seal off the furnace completely from the ingress of infiltration air.<br>
By sealing off the furnace from infiltration air the volume of waste gas flowing through the exhaust’ duct is reduced. This advantage is particularly effective when using oxygen burners which have the advantage that pure oxygen, contrary to air having a proportion of approx. 79% nitrogen, permits achieving a substantially reduced volume of waste gas and a significantly higher flame temperature. This advantage is also maintained in the proposed method if the furnace is operated at constant vacuum pressure, since due to the seal-closing of the furnace door the volume of infiltration air entering the furnace is not increased due to the relatively elevated pressure predominating outside, as was formerly the case with previous known methods.<br><br>
A further advantage of this arrangement of the burner in the furnace is that the direction of flow of the flame and thus also that of the oxygen crosses that of the waste gas flowing from the furnace into the exhaust duct. Now, the hydrocarbons produced during smelting can be subsequently incinerated by the burner and the resulting liberated energy can be made use of for the smelting process, thus saving primary energy and reducing the noxious content of the waste gases.<br>
Yet a further advantage of this arrangement of the burner in the furnace is that the noxious substances liberated during charging can now be subsequently incinerated at any time due to the burner being continuously in operation.<br>
Due to the invention the additional advantage of reducing the velocity in the flow of gases in the furnace is achieved by reducing the volume of the waste gases so that the dust content discharged from the furnace is substantially diminished. This also results in a reduction of the smelting salt consumed since the boundary layer between salt ceiling and gas space in which the latter evaporates is torn open less frequently due to the lower velocity of the flow of the gases. In addition, the dwelling time of the waste gases in the furnace is longer so that the noxious substances contained in the waste gas can be better incinerated.<br>
In one preferred embodiment an oxygen burner is employed as the smelting burner due to the volume of waste gases then being less and the flame temperature higher than with an air burner.<br>
Preferably the rotary movement of the furnace and/or the volume of burner fuel are<br>
adapted to the charging material, since due to the rotary movement new surfaces are<br>
repeatedly liberated so that the volume of evaporated hydrocarbons can fluctuate and<br>
differing amounts of charging material also require differing amounts of energy for<br>
	stenciling.<br><br>
Particularly preferred is a configuration of the charging door of the rotary drum furnace allowing the charging port to be seal-closed so that no unwanted air can infiltrate into the furnace. In this arrangement the door is disposed on the furnace so that it is able to rotate with the latter. Due to this optimum sealing of the furnace, fuel efficiencies are also achieved which were formerly not attained.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention a waste gas measuring device is provided in the exhaust duct permitting control of the volume of fuel and combustion air or combustion oxygen as a function of the gases flowing through the exhaust pipe of the furnace, particularly as a function of the concentration of hydrocarbons. Particularly preferred is an optical means of waste gas measurement.<br>
Preferably, charging the furnace is done continuously, e.g. via a gating system so that smelting is sequenced without opening the furnace and thus without allowing gases to enter into or escape from the furnace. Preferably the smelting burner generates a long flame extending relatively far into the furnace so that also the smelt located further away from the burner receives an adequate supply of heat. One major advantage of the method is that in its form as described the burner combines the function of the primary burner with that of the secondary burner.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail by way of a preferred embodiment with reference to the attached drawing, the sole Figure of which shows a vertical section through an apparatus according to the invention for smelting aluminum, scrap and remainders containing aluminum with which the method according to the invention may be implerataileu.<br>
In the inside of a cylindrically shaped rotary drum furnace 1 the charging stock 6 is deposited. The two ends of the rotary drum furnace 1 are tapered. At one end a charging door 2 is provided, through which the charging stock"6"is introduced into or brought out of the furnace. At the end of the charging event the charging door.<br><br>
may be connected to the rotary drum furnace 1 seal-closed.<br>
At the end of the rotary drum furnace 1 opposite to that of the charging door 2 a smelting burner 3 is provided. The smelting burner 3 is located in a waste gas port 7 to which the exhaust duct 4 connects so as to permit the exit of the waste gas resulting from smelting. The smelting burner 3 is protected against hot corrosion since it is located in the hot flow of waste gas. In the exhaust duct 4 a waste gas measuring device 5 is disposed with which the concentration of hydrocarbons in the waste gas can be measured.<br>
The charging door 2 of the rotary drum furnace 1 corotates with the latter in operation thereof. The smelting burner 3 and the exhaust duct 4 at the opposite ends are disposed non-rotating, however.<br>
In the smelting process a flame is generate by the burner 3 which extends far into the furnace 1. Due to the heat applied by the flame the charging stock 6 smelts with continuous rotation of the furnace 1 so that a more-or-less consistent smelting of the stock is achieved.<br>
The waste gas materializing from this smelting procedure is introduced through the waste gas port 7 into the exhaust duct 4, it thereby flowing past the flame of smelting burner 3 so that noxious substances contained in the waste gas such as e.g. hydrocarbons can be incinerated.<br>
The waste gas measuring device 5 disposed in the exhaust duct 4 establishes the concentration of the substances such as e.g. hydrocarbons contained in the waste gas for adjusting the volume of fuel and/or combustion air or oxygen required for combustion applied to the burner 3 as a function of the sensed concentration so that the energy offered in the furnace, resulting from the combustion of the fuel and the incineration of the hydrocarborts, is maintained constant, to ensure an homogenous<br><br>
sequence in the smelting procedure and to minimize the noxious substances in the waste gas resulting from the smelting process.<br>
At the start of the smelting process firstly the organic components present in the charging stock 6 are pyrolysed which results in a high concentration of hydrocarbons in the furnace 1. This is why the burner 3 is initially operated overstoichiometrically so that more oxygen gains access to the furnace 1 than is necessary for combusting the volume of fuel supplied through the burner 3. With this additional oxygen the hydrocarbons present in the furnace I are incinerated so that the concentration thereof as measured by the waste gas measuring device 5 in the exhaust duct 4 is reduced.<br>
On completion of volatilizaton of the organic components of the charging stock 6 which is established by the reduction in hydrocarbons content by the waste gas measuring device 5 the burner 3 is again operated stoichiometrically or weakly understoichiometrically with added power so that the fuel availability via the burner 3 increases in the furnace 1 and smelting of the charging stock 6 is quickly attained, the concentration of oxygen in the furnace 1 being slight so as to avoid loss of aluminum.<br>
The concentration By volume of the noxious substances resulting from hydrolysis during smelting such as e.g. hydrocarbons depends, among other things, on the rotative speed of the furnace 1, thus by means of the waste gas measuring device 5 the rotary movement of the furnace 1 may be adjusted so that the volume of noxious substances is further minimized.<br><br><br>
