				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a gel processing and transfer device. The device ensures un-damaged, intact gel while performing all the steps with agarose gel or the like that are involved after electrophoresis of nucleic acids or the like and before placing the gel onto the membrane for the purpose of transfer of nucleic acids or the like. Importantly, apparatus ensures un-damaged, intact gel during transfer and transportation of the gel from the device onto the membrane or like. The present invention also describes the method to use the apparatus.<br>
Background and Prior Art References<br>
One of the ways to separate macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, charged sugars and peptides etc. is through electrophoresis wherein, electrical voltage is applied to the moities to be separated and these move with different velocities in a solution depending upon their charge, size, shape and viscosity of the medium. To disallow diffusion of the macromolecules in solution due to convection currents, the solution is supported on a porous matrix.<br>
A number of such matrices are available (Davis, M. G. 1986. Electrophoretic techniques. In A biologists guide to principles and techniques of practical biochemistry. (Wilson, K. and Goulding, K. H., eds.) 3rd Ed. English Language Book Society/Edward Arnold. London, pp. 245-268; Plummer, D. T. 1988. An introduction to practical biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company Limited, New Delhi, 332p). These include (a) paper, (b) cellulose acetate strip, (c) cellulose, silica, kieselguhr or alumina layered on a glass plate, and (d) various types of gel matrices. Gel as a supporting medium is a medium of choice in protein and nucleic acid research. This includes gels made from (a) starch, (b) agar (a mixture of agarose and agaropectin; dissolved by heating in a buffer medium to get the porous matrix), (c) agarose (a polymer of D-galactose and 3,6-anhydro L-galactose; dissolved by heating in a buffer medium to get the porous matrix), and (d) polyacrylamide.<br>
Normally, agarose gel is a matrix of choice while working with nucleic acids. One of the requirements of working with nucleic acid is to transfer the separated nucleic acid from the gel matrix onto a membrane in a blotter. The blotter is an apparatus wherein the nucleic acids or the like are transferred from the gel onto the membrane. In a vacuum blotter, the process of transfer is assisted with the help of vacuum. This constitutes one of the most important steps of southern or northern blotting.<br>
In southern blotting, deoxyribonucleic acid (hereinafter known as DNA) is digested with endonucleases followed by electrophoretic separation of the digested fragments on agarose gel and finally transfer of the digested DNA onto a membrane. To ease transfer of large-sized DNA from the gel onto the membrane, DNA strands need to be (i) cleaved using 0.25 M hydrochloric acid, (ii) denatured using 1.5 N sodium chloride/ 0.5 N sodium hydroxide to obtain single strand, and (iii) neutralized using 1.5 N sodium chloride/ 0.5 N tris-chloride (pH, 7.0) to allow proper binding of DNA onto the membrane onto which the transfer has to take place. After achieving these steps of processing, the gel needs to be placed onto a membrane to allow transfer of DNA from the gel onto the membrane (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A. and Struhl, K. 1998. Current protocols in molecular biology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York, pp. 2.8.1- 2.9.15).<br>
In northern blotting, ribonucleic acid (hereinafter known as RNA) is run on agarose gel that usually contains formaldehyde. For efficient transfer of RNA from the gel onto the membrane, RNA containing gel needs to be (i) washed several times with water, (ii) denatured using 1.5 N sodium chloride/ 0.05 N sodium hydroxide, (iii) neutralized using 1.5 N sodium chloride/ 0.5 N tris-chloride (pH, 7.4), (iv) soaked in 20 x SSC (3 M sodium chloride, 0.3 M sodium citrate; adjust pH to 7.0 with 1 M hydrochloric acid). After achieving these steps of processing, the gel needs to be placed onto a membrane to allow transfer of RNA from the gel onto the membrane (Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A. and Struhl, K. 1998. Current protocols in molecular biology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York, pp. 4.9.1-4.9.16).<br>
These processes are normally carried out in containers which are normally baking dish or in plastic box (Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis T. 1989. Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press. New York; Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A. and Struhl, K. 1998. Current protocols in molecular biology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York). While changing various solutions as mentioned in the above paragraph, the container is tilted to remove the solution. The gel needs to be held by hand to avoid falling of the gel along with the solution. Secondly, after giving various washes with different solutions as mentioned in the above paragraph, the gel has to taken out from the container to be placed over the membrane. This second process leads to the damage of the delicate gel. Also, the gel has to be placed onto the membrane properly and once kept onto the membrane, the gel can not be moved.<br>
As recognized herein, the agarose gel holding precious samples of DNA or RNA is delicate and fragile, and liable to damage during various steps mentioned above. The risk of damage increases with increase in the size of the gel. Particularly, during the processing of large number of samples, the size of the gel may be as big as, but not limited to, measuring 15 x 22 centimeter (width x length).<br>
This dictates the development of a gel processing and transfer device that ensures intact gel during various processes as described above.<br>
Also, while working with proteins, the staining of the proteins requires several solutions to be changed one after another and once the proteins are stained, the photography of the gel is essential to record the data (Hames, B. D. 1990. One dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In Gel electrophoresis of proteins: A practical approach. (Hames, B. D. and Rickwood, D., eds.) 2nd Ed. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 1-147). This also dictates the development of such device, wherein intactness of the gel should be ensured during staining protocols and the device should be capable of presenting the gel for the purpose of photography.<br>

Product number Z 35,829-0 and Z 35,830-4 by M/s Sigma Chemical Co, USA and product number 482030 by M/s Tarsons Products Pvt. Ltd., India describe a gel staining tray. However, the product is basically a plastic box structure with an outlet at the base and has the following shortcomings:<br>
1.        The product can accommodate a limited-sized gel<br>
2.        The gel is broken during transfer from the product onto a blotter<br>
Since the Product number Z 35,829-0 and Z 35,830-4 by M/s Sigma Chemical Co, USA is also similar to the one by M/s. Tarsons Products Pvt. Ltd., India (product number 482030) apart from the size, end result is likely to be the same.)<br>
Thus, there is no gel processing and transfer device that ensures intact gel (i) during various processes that are involved after electrophoresis of nucleic acids and before placing the gel onto the membrane for the purpose of transfer of nucleic acid, and (ii) during transfer of the gel from the device onto the membrane. The patent search has been conducted to survey the existing patents relating to the use of processing and transfer of gels. The critical study of the prior patents indicates that none of them is, somehow, not at all connected to the type of applications the present invention is intended to.

The following example is given by the way of illustration of the device of the present invention and it should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
General method for construction of the device<br>
The present invention provides with an apparatus, a gel processing and transfer device, that consists of at least four separable components. In figure 2. of the drawings accompanying this specification, the base plate of the device of present invention is depicted. The base plate (1) of the device has a nozzle (2) attached to the rectangular hole (3). A silicone tubing (4) along with a clamp (5) is fixed onto the open end of the nozzle. In figure 6. of the drawings accompanying this specification, an arrangement of the various components of the device is shown. Retaining rim (6) of the device is attached to the base plate using nuts and bolts (7). Holes (8) are drilled on the outer edge of the base plate and the retaining rim for fastening nuts and bolts. The retaining rim has four side walls (9) joined perpendicularly to the horizontal plate (10) in such a way that side walls protrude below the horizontal plate. A rubber strip (11) is fixed outside the protrusion on the lower side of the horizontal plate. An "O" ring (12) is placed in the room created by the protrusion of the side walls and the horizontal plate of the retaining rim.<br>
After fastening the base plate and the retaining rim, lid (13) is placed over the side walls of the retaining rim. The lid remains fixed onto the assembly with the help of atleast four protrusions (14) attached to the lid.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Preparation of the base plate<br>
The base plate was prepared using a 2 mm thick polycarbonate sheet, cut with the help of hexagonal blade exactly measuring to size of 28 x 22 cm. To give strength to the edges a<br>
2 cm wide and 2 mm thick polycarbonate sheet is glued using chloroform (organic solvent), to the base plate. A drain out facility is made in the base plate by making a 0.5 x 0.5 cm hole on 28 cm long side of the base plate at a distance of 11 cm from one end of the length. Width-wise, the hole is placed at a distance of 19.5 cm from one end of the 22 cm wide base plate. To the hole a small nozzle measuring 4.5 cm is attached. The nozzle is prepared with the pieces of 2 mm thick polycarbonate sheet, cut to fit the size. To the nozzle a silicone tube, 30 cm in length, exactly fitting to the open end of the nozzle (with inner diameter of 0.6 cm), is attached. A clamp is placed onto the silicone tube to control the flow of solution.<br>
To fasten the base plate, to the retaining rim; holes (diameter 1 cm) are drilled on the base plate, at a distance of 1 cm from the outer edge in both the directions. A total of 5 holes are drilled on the side measuring 28 cm and a total of 4 holes are drilled on the side measuring 22 cm. The holes at the corners are common on length and width-wise.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Preparation of the retaining rim<br>
The retaining rim of the object of invention is prepared using 2 mm thick polycarbonate sheet measuring 28 x 22 cm in outer dimension. The inner plate of 24 x 18 cm was cut and removed from the overall plate to give a gasket of polycarbonate. A similar gasket was cut from a different plate and glued onto the first to give additional strength to the retaining rim. The side walls of retaining rim are made from a single 84 cm long and 4 cm wide piece of 2 mm thick polycarbonate, bent at 3 corners at an angle of 90° to obtain a rectangular structure. The side walls of retaining rim thus formed brings two free ends of the polycarbonate piece together to allow joining. The side-walls of retaining rim is attached perpendicularly to 2 cm wide horizontal plates in such a way that the horizontal plates are always outside the retaining rim. Attachement of side-walls of retaining rim with the horizontal plate, is performed in such a way that 2 mm of side-walls always protrude below the horizontal plate. This arrangement gives an effective height of 4.2 cm to the retaining rim.After fastening the nuts and bolts to the retaining rim and the base plate, the assembly looks like an open rectangular box that forms an enclosure offering an effective space of 24 x 18 cm onto the base plate.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Preparation of no-solution-leak system<br>
To check the leakage from the apparatus a rubber "O" ring (4 millimeters thickness) is placed under the retaining rim. The "O" ring is placed in the space provided by the protrusion of side walls to the horizontal plates of the retaining rim. Since the horizontal plate of the side rim actually sits on the base plate, the placing of an "O" ring on the retaining rim creates a gap, which may lead to damage of horizontal plates during fastening with nut and bolts. To avoid this, a rubber strip of 1.5 mm thickness was fixed around the "O" ring on the retaining rim. Such an arrangement resulted into a "no-solution-leak" system.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Preparation of the lid<br>
The lid is an important component of the object of invention and provides safety to the gel and to the solution in the object of invention. Also, it will check evaporation of solutions from the device<br>
The lid measuring 24 x 18 cm is constructed using a 2 mm thick polycarbonate sheet. To avoid slipping of the lid from top of the retaining rim, a 2.5 cm long and 4.0 cm wide protrusion made with polycarbonate is fixed onto the top of the lid. The protrusion covers the retaining rim from out-side and fixes the lid on to the side walls of the retaining rim in the complete assembly. A folded piece of polycarbonate was fixed in the center of the lid to give a handle for lid and eases its movement.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Method to use the device<br>
The invention describes the method to use the device for the agarose gel or the like containing nucleic acids or the like. The following sequence should be followed: (i)       Autoclave the complete assembly of the object of invention.(ii)      If nucleic acid to be used is RNA, treat the whole assembly with diethyl<br>
pyrocarbonate treated (0.1%) water for 12-16 hours before autoclaving. (iii)     Keep the gel to be transferred ready, (iv)     Remove the lid of the device and keep aside, (v)      Remove retaining rim of the device by unscrewing nut and bolts, (vi)     Base plate is now exposed and is ready to accept the gel. (vii)    Bring the tray containing gel to be transferred on the top of base plate, (viii)   While holding the gel tray with both the hands, tilt the tray from the front and<br>
bring it very close (almost touching) to the base plate.<br>
(ix)     While holding the tray, give light push to the gel with the help of the thumb, (x)      Concomitantly, the gel tray should be pulled away from the gel. (xi)     After a few seconds, the gel from the gel tray will be transferred onto the base<br>
plate.<br>
(xii)    Place the retaining rim onto the base plate, (xiii)   Fasten the retaining rim with the help of nut and bolts, (xiv)   Ensure that clamp on the drain-out tube is tight enough to avoid leakage of any<br>
solution.<br>
(xv)     Pour the required solution.<br>
(xvi)   As per the need, whole of the assembly may be kept over a shaker, (xvii)  To remove the poured solution, the clamp on the drain-out pipe should be<br>
loosened.<br>
(xviii) Once, the solution is drained out, fasten the clamp and pour the solution, (xix)    Perform such steps as per the protocol of your choice, (xx)     Cover and uncover the lid as and when required, (xxi)    Once the processing is over, remove lid. (xxii)   Remove nut bolts or any fastening mechanism, (xxiii) Remove retaining rim.<br>
(xxiv) Take the base plate containing the gel near to a blotter, (xxv)   Position the base plate onto the blotter where the gel has to be transferred. <br>
(xxvi) While holding the base plate with both hands, tilt the base from the front and<br>
bring it very close (almost touching) to the place where the gel needs to be<br>
transferred, (xxvii) While holding the base plate, give light push to the gel with the help of thumb. It<br>
is also possible to hold the base plate with one hand and use another hand to push<br>
the gel slowly for its transfer onto the blotting surface, (xxviii) Concomitantly, the base plate should be pulled away from the gel. (xxix) After a few seconds, the gel from the base plate stands transferred onto the<br>
blotting surface, (xxx)   If the purpose is not to transfer the gel onto the blotting surface but to photograph<br>
the gel, then perform the following sequence following step number (xx)<br>
onwards:<br>
(a)	Bring the device near the photography unit<br>
(b)	Uncover the lid<br>
(c)	Remove the solution from the apparatus<br>
(d)	During draining out of the solution, ensure that the gel is properly spread<br>
(e)	Remove the retaining rim as in steps (xxii) and (xxiii) above<br>
(f)	Since base plate is a transparent surface, the photography can easily be<br>
performed<br>
(xxxi) During processing of the gel, the drain-out tube can easily be fitted tightly in the space between nut and bolt and the side walls of the retaining rim<br>
