Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a spatially encoded polymer matrix in the form of a bead or a granule for combinatorial solid phase synthesis, ^sa^ofl^^unctioDaUptQ,-leomics, and diagnostic use. There is also provided a composition of such beads or granules. Each beaded polymer matrix of the composition comprises a plurality of spatially immobilised particles. The spatial immobilisation of the particles confers on each beaded polymer matrix a "fingerprinf which enables identification of unique beads in a population of beads. The unique identification of individual beads makes it possible to perform combinatorial chemistry strategies while logging individual chemical transformation.<br>
Bacltground of the Invention<br>
The synthesis of organic molecules on solid-phase synthesis beads has experi¬enced an explosion of infersst since Merrrfields pioneering work in the peptide area several decades ago. in large part, this renaissance has been driven by the advent of comblnaforlal chemistry, which takes advantage of the ability to synthesize large and diverse libraries of compounds efficiently on solid support.<br>
One inherent difficulty of producing large libraries by combinatorial chemistry is the problem of how to determine the reaction history in the form of the individual synthe¬sis steps resulting in the synthesis of any given combinatorial library member. With¬out such information it is not possible to deconvolute the structure of the combinato-ria( library member.<br>
J<br><br>
When employing a large number of solid supports and a large number ot symnesis steps and/or processing metliods, the procedure of "deconvolution" is particularly difficult. In many practical cases, where high throughput screening and fast analysis is required, this problem is inherently associated with conventional methods for solid-phase synthesis.<br>
Despite the tremendous practical advantages afforded by solid-phase synthesis, few reports have appeared in which a direct detennination of the on-resin chemistry has been made possible in a practical way. Examples of techniques that have been used incfude radiography, nanoprobe nuclear magnetic resonance, singfe-bead fluo¬rescence microscopy, IR spetroscopy, and optical analysis.<br>
Combinatorial libraries may be assembled by a number of methods including the "spiit-andwecombine" methods described e.g. by Furka ei al. (198S, 14th )nl Congr. Biochem., Prague, Czechoslovakia 5:47; 1991, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 37:487-493) and by Lam et al. (1991, Nature 354; 82-84), and reviewed by Eichler et a). (1995, Medicinal Research Reviews 15 (6): 481 -496) and by Balltenhohl et al. (1996, Angew. Chem, Int. Ed, Engl. 35: 2288-2337).<br>
The split-and-recombine synthesis method involves dividing a plurality of solid sup¬ports such as polymer beads into n equal fractions representative of the number of available "building blocks' for each step of the synthesis (e.g., 20 L-amino acids, 4 different nucleotides etc.), coupling a single respective building block to each poly¬mer bead of a corresponding fraction, and then thoroughly mixing the polymer beads of all the fractions together. This process is repeated for a total of x cycles to produce a stochastic collection of up to N* different compounds.<br>
The conventional split synthesis technologies refen-ed to above present difficulties when ft is desired to detect and isolate a combinatorial library member of interest. In this regard, It is necessary to first cleave the member from Its solid support before identifying the member by techniques such as mass spectroscopy or HPLC. This is time consuming and cumbersome and in some cases, cleavage is not possible.<br>
Janda (1994, Proc. Natl, Acad. Scl. USA 91:10779-10785) describes a method In virfilch each synthesis st^ of a combinatorial (ibrafy member is followed by an inde-<br><br>
pendent coupling of an identifier tag to a solid support. Through a series of sequen¬tial chemical steps, a sequence of identifier tags are built up in parallel with the compounds being syntliesised on the solid support. When the combinatorial synthe¬sis Is complete, the sequence of operations any particular solid support has gone through may be retraced by separately analysing the tag sequence. Accordingly, use of identifier tags in this manner provides a means wfiereby one can Identify the building blocl(S sequentially added to an individual solid support during the synthesis of a member of a combinatorial library.<br>
WO 98/47838 dfsctoses a method for the preparation of a chemical library on a plu¬rality of synthesis particles comprising random features.<br>
WO 93/06121 discloses a general stochastic method for synthesising a combinato¬rial compound library on solid supports from which library members may be cleaved to provide a soluble library. The identifier tag may be attached directly to a member of the library or to the solid support on which the member is synthesised. Tags such as oligonucleotides can be identified by sequencing or hybridisation. Amplification of oligonucleotide tags by PCR can be employed when only trace amounts of oligonu¬cleotides are available for analysis. However, such Identification methods are time consuming and inefficient.<br>
US 5,721,099 discloses a process for constructing complex combinatorial chemical libraries of compounds wherein each compound is produced by a single reaction series and is bound to an individual solid support on which is bound a combination of four distinguishable identifiers which differ from one another. TTie combination provides a specific formula comprising a tag component capable of analysis and a linking component capable of being selectively cleaved to release the tag compo¬nent. Prior to analysis of a combinatorial library, each) tag component must be cleaved from the support thus creating at least one additional step wfiich is time consuming and inefficient.<br>
Also, the above methods all rely on parallel, orthogonal synthesis of identifier tags which adds substantially to the time taken for completion of a combinatorial synthe¬sis and has the potential of interfering with the synthesis.<br><br>
Specirometnc encoding methods have atso been dsscrtbed in which decoding of a library member is permitted by placing a solid support directly into a spectrometer for analysis. This eliminates the need for a chemical cleavage step. For example, Gsysen e( at. (1996, Chem. Biol. 3:679-668) describe a method In which isotopl-cally varied tags are used to encode a reaction history. A mass spectrometer is used to decode the reactton history by measuring the ratiometric signal afforded by the multiply isotopicaliy labelled tags. A disadvantage of this method is the relatively small number of multiply Isotopicaliy labeled reagents that are commercially avail¬able.<br>
Optical encoding techniques have also been described In which the absorption or fluorescence emission spectrum of a solid support Is measured. Sebestyen et al. (1993, Pept. 1992 Proc. 22nd Eur. Pept. Symp. 63-64), Campian et al. (1994, In Innovation and Perspectives on Solid Phase Synthesis; Epton, R., Bimiinghami Mayflower, 469-472), and Egner et al. f 1997, Chem. Commun. 735-736) have de¬scribed *e use of both chromophoric and/or fluorescent tags for bead labeling in peptide combinatorial synthesis. Although this use provides an advantage for de-convolui'ing the sirudure of a iibrary member by determining the absorption or fluo¬rescence emission spectrum of a bead, the encoding of a large library would require the use of many chromophores or f luorophores where spectral superimposition would be a Iikely drawback.<br>
WO 95/32425 discloses the coupling on beads of (t) fluorescently labelled tags hav¬ing intensities that differ by a factor of at least 2, and/or (ii) multiple different fluores¬cent tags that can be used in varying ratios, to encode a combinatorial library. Such beads may be used in concert with flow cytometry to construct a series of combina¬torial libraries by spilt synthesis procedure. Although this method has advantages in relation to providing a lead structure, it Is necessary to construct and analyse multi¬ple libraries commensurate with the number of stages used for the combinatorial synthesis, which is cumbersome and time consuming.<br>
WO 97/15390 describes a physical encoding system in which chemically inert solid particles are each labelled with a unique machine readable code. The code may be a binary code although higher codes and aiphanumerics are contemplated. The code may consist of surface deformations including pits, holes, hollows, grooves or<br><br>
notches or any combination of ttiese. Such deformations are appiied by micro-machining. Aiternatively, the code may reside in the shape of the particie itself. Solid particles comprising a first phase for combinatorial synthesis and a second phase containing a machine readable code are exemplified wherein the second phase may be superimposed on, or encapsulated within, the first phase. The microscopic code on the particles may be Interrogated and read using a microscope-based image capture and processing system. The machine readable code may be read "on-line" between different process steps of a combinatorial synthesis thus allowing the proc¬ess sequence, or audit trail, for each bead to be recorded.<br>
Nano bar coding for bioanalysis has also been described by Keating, Natan and co¬workers (Science, 2001, vol. 294,137).<br>
Xu et al. (2003) Nucleic Acid Research 31 (8);e43 describes the use of corrt/inations of fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystais to encode microspheres. The nanocrys-tals are too small to allow visualisation of their spatial location in the bead. Further¬more, as overlap of emission spectra needs to be avoided, the number of different nanocrystais that can be used in one bead wilt be limited.<br>
WO 00/32542 discloses high throughput screening based on caniers having distinc¬tive codes such as electronmagnetic radiation-related compounds. Similar methods have been described by Battersby et al. (2001, Drug Discovery Today, vol. 6, no. 12 (Suppl.), SI 9-26); Battersby and Trau (2002, Trends in Biotechnology, vol. 20, no. 4, 167-173; tyleza (2000, Dnjg Discovery Today, vo. 1, no. 1, 38-41), and by Ferrer et al. (2002, J. Am. Chem. Soc, vol. 124, no. 9. p.1994-2003).<br>
Many of the disadvantages of the known methods described above, as well as many of the needs not met by these methods, are overcome by the present invention, which, as described herein below, provides several advantages over the above-described prior art methods.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is a first object of the present invention to prepare libraries of specific active com¬pounds with respect to biochemical interactions, such as substrate catalysis, purifi-<br><br>
Cation or isolation of desirable targets, as well as studying iiost-guest interactions, and preferable materials properties.<br>
This is exemplified by compounds such as e.g. polypeptides (alpha-peptides, beta-peptides, and tlie like), polynucleotides (DNA, RNA, LNA and PNA, including non-natural and modified nucleotides comprising non-natural or modified nucieobases and/or backbones and/or carbohydrate moleWea), as well as carbohydrates, scaf¬folded small molecules, and mimetics of these compound classes. The libraries are preferably bead based and offer as such several advantages over prior art libraries based on chips and similar solid supports.<br>
The active compounds of the invention can be screened for the identification of novel ligands that interact with e.g. a receptor target of interest. As such, the active compounds can be used e.g. for identifying or further develop potential drug candi¬dates, new catalysts and materials with novel functionalities. One important applica¬tion of the libraries is in the diagnostic and functional proteomics area. In the follow¬ing the use is exemplified by the screening of biological targets.<br>
For any given receptor target, the probability of successfully identifying a potent li-gand through a process of randomly screening molecular repertoires will increase as the size and structural diversity of the library is also increased. The present inven¬tion makes it possible to i) rapidly identify an individual bead in a composition of beads based on individual bBad "fingerprints", and ji) immediately "deconvoJuting" the sequential steps employed in the sotld-phase synthesis of the biologically active compound on the individual bead in question.<br>
in order to solve this problem the invention provides in a first aspect a beaded poly¬mer matrix in which particles, also ternied "microbeads" herein, have been immobi¬lized in a random spatial arrangement such that each bead can preferably be uniquely identified by the 3-dlmensional pattern formed by the particles. The parti¬cles can be labelled particles made from the same polymer material as the base synthesis polymer or they can be composed of a different msteriai. The pattern can be detected by a property of the particle that differs from the sumDunding polymer matrix. This difference can be achieved by fluorescence labels, colour labels or by different diffractive or reflective properties of the immobilized material.<br><br>
The uniquely labelled particles can be divided into portions with recording of their identiti' and location and subjected to different reaction conditions accordingly. Us¬ing combinatorial methods such as "Split and recombine" synthesis It Is thus possi¬ble to record the precise history of reactions for each particle and thereby the struc¬ture of the product formed for each unique bead<br>
It is furthermore possible after screening and isolation of active hits to identify the structure of the active beads by recording the encoding pattern of the bead and cor¬relate the pattern with all patterns recorded during the synthesis.<br>
It is also possible to use the tool to perform diagnostic tests with mixtures of active ligands on encoded beads and after measuring the clinical values from the beads decode the results by reading the pattern of the beads.<br>
Additionally, the invention maizes it possible to purify and/or Isolate targets from a mixture potentiafly comprising a target having an affini^ for a ligand attached to a beaded polymer matrix. The isolation of the target can involve a chromatographic separation step resulting in the separation of the target from the additional compo¬nents of the mixture. Affinity chromatography as well as any other chromatographic separation step can be employed for the separation and/or isolation of target com¬pounds from a mixture of compounds.<br>

Figure 1: The principle of recording of coordinates for encoding particles in a bead and conversion Xo a orientation independent distance matrix that uniquely identifies the single bead. Three unique distances within 500 micron beads comprising 1 mi¬cron particles there is 65.449.846 positions giving in theory -3x10^^ combinations from which at least 3 x 1 o'^ will be unique. Orthogonal recording on three LCD de¬tectors yields 9 co-ordinates. These can be paired based either on fluorescence intensity or on a fourth non orthogonal detector. Conversion to inter-partlcle dis¬tances gives an orientation independent parameter set. The 3 distances (3 particles) are sorted and indexed according to the longest distance, Beads are sorted accord¬ing to number (3,4 or 5) of particles prior to use, If beads with 4 particles are used, 6 distances are stored etc. Alternatively, two scanning lasers can directly yield the three coordinate sets on the moving bead.<br>

Photon fluorescence spectroscopy: One photon fluorescence spectroscopy, which Is the same as standard fluorescence spectroscopy, is based on the facts that a molecule can be excited by a single photon, and that the excited molecule after a internal process emits a photon with a lower energy than the excitation photon. The energy (the specfnjm) as well as the rate of emission is specific for the molecule in its specific environment. Two-photon excitation of fluorescence is based on the prin¬ciple that two photons of ionger wavelength light are simultaneously absorbed by a fluorochrome which would normally be excited by a single photon, with a shorter<br><br>

Swelling: When beads or granules or particles or vacuoles are capable of swelling, any physical measurement of the afore-mentioned, including size determinations and volume deternilnatlons, refer to measurements conducted for the swelled bead or granule or particle or vacuole. Swelling of the beads are for practical reasons measured as the volume of a packed bed of beads swollen in a specific solvent and divided by the dry weight of the beads. The unit is given as ml/g. Typical solvents are water, methanol and dichloromethane, but any suitable solvent may be chosen. When the refractive index of fiie swollen bead or granuie is different from the refrac¬tive index of the surrounding solvent the swollen bead or granule will function as an optical lens. When the relative positions of Immobilised particles inside the swollen beads or granules are determined by optical means this lens effect may give rise to inaccurate determination of the relative positions of the Immobilised particles. Pre-<br><br>
ferred solvents give rise to as little difference in retractive index between the solvent and the swollen baad or granule as possible. For Instance when the polymer matrix comprises cross-linked polyethyleneglycol a one-to-one mixture of ethanol and glyc¬erol gives rise to nearly no refractive index difference,<br>
Unique distance matrix: Each bead is uniquely identified by an orientation Inde¬pendent distance matrix describing the relative positions of particles within the en¬coded bead.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Distance matrix determination<br>
In one embodiment, the spatial immobilisation of the plurality of particles in each beaded polymer matrix Is essentially unique for each bead. The spatial positions of particles in each bead can be defined by sets of coordinates, {x,y,z) of particle cen¬ters of said particles, relative to one reference point of the detection. Furthennore, the relative positions in space of centers (x,y,z) of immobilized particles can be de¬tected based on recorciing of 2D-projections of the particles.<br><br>
In one embodiment, 3 2D-projections are recorded along 3 orthogonal axis x, y ano z to generate 3 sets of 2D-coordina1es (y,z), (x.z) and (x,y), respectively, from which the SD-coordimies (x,y,z} of particle centers can be derived. A stack of 2D projec¬tions can be generated by confocal or focal microscopy to recreate the 3D image matrix of the bead from which the relative particle position {x,y,z) in space can be determined.<br>
One method for determinatJofi of relative particle positions within a bead can be based on focussed scanning lasers and laminar tluidics, preferably methods in which the coordinates x and y of a particle position is determined by fast scanning two orthogonally aligned lasers over two cross sections of the moving bead while the z coordinate is determined by the time of flight of the bead af known flow rates. Accordingly, ft is possible to determine the coordinates x and y of a particle position by using a single laser and a rotating mirror that via 2 or three geometrically ar¬ranged static mirrors reflects the laser beam along 2 or 3 orthogonal axis<br>
A further method for determination of relative particle positions witliin a bead can be based on phase shifting digital holography, which determines the 3D structure of the interface between the particles and the surrounding polymer of the bead based on the reflections of light of said interface [lohirou Yamaguchi, Jun-ichi Kato, Sohgo Ohta, and Jun Mizuno, 1 December 2001, Vol. 40, No. 34, APPLIED OPTICS], [Etienna Cuche, Fr'ed'ericBevilacqua, and Christian Depeursinge March 1, f999/ Vol. 24, No. 5/ OPTICS LETTERS 291].<br>
Accordingly, one method for recording the unique pattern of each encoded bead comprises the steps of recording the relative coordinates of the center of the spa¬tially immobilised particles and calculating a distance matrix based on the recorded coordinates. Accordingly, it is possible to convert the relative coordinates into abso¬lute and unique parameters for each bead by generating for each bead a distance matrix of inter particle distances.<br>
The coordinates of the particles in a bead can be generated in a variety of different ways.<br><br>
1.	A laser or conventional light excitation of the entire bead can be combined with detection along 3 orthogonal axis with three CCD cameras and the three sets of coondinates measured in 2D X,V; Y,Z and X,Z for each particle can be used to correlate the particles to give a unique set of parameters XY2 for each immobilized particle.<br>
2.	A principle of focal or confocal microscopy can be used to obtain a 3D repre¬sentation of the bead in which the 3 coordinates are the x and y of the parti¬cle in the a particular picture while the z-coordinate is derived from the focal depth.<br>
3.	Using fluorescence labelled particles a set of two focussed alternating scan¬ning lasers along two orthogonal axis can excite the fluorophores on a mov¬ing particle in a flowcell and the fluorescence recorded with a pmt. The coor¬dinates are generated from the two excitation positions and the position of the bead in the fluidic stream. This bead position is measured by the time of flight of the bead as determined from extinction measurement on one of the lasers.<br>
The methods and spaiiatly encoded beads described above can be used to identify single beads out of a very large assembly of beads by rapid decoding at any point of process time. They can furthermore be used in connection with diagnostic kits where a large mixture of beads are used in a fashion similar to that of spatial arrays of e. g. DNA or protease substrates.<br>
When polymer beads encoded with spatially immobilised particles are to be identi¬fied by the distance matrix between said spatially immobilised particles, the relative position of each particle must be determined unambiguously within some acceptable experimental error.<br>
To a large extent this can be done by muftiple imaging or laser scanning. However, erroneous distance matrices may result in cases where the optical data obtained gives rise to two or more three-dimensional (3D) interpretations. For instance, when encoded beads are viewed from two orthogonal angles corresponding to an x,z-projection and a y.z-proiection, a "correspondance problem" arises when two or<br><br>
more spatially immobilised particles have the same z-value within the optical accu¬racy of the equipment. One example of the "correspondance problem" arising from one set of images giving rise to two or more possible 3D-struciares is illustrated in Fig. 9.<br>
Below is provided three non-limiting examples of conceivable solutions to the "cor¬respondence problem" illustrated in Fig. 9:<br>
Solution 1: Focal depth evaluation<br>
Spatially immobilised particles positioned at the focal plane of the imaging objective appear as sharp and intense bright spots, whereas particles positioned away from the focal plane of the objective appear as less sharp and less intense, the sharp¬ness and intensity gradually decreasing as the distance from the particle to the focal plane increases.<br>
In case that the dimensions of the Imaging section exceeds the focal depth of the objectives, any 2D-pro]ection will - apart from giving the 2D-positions of each parti¬cle - also provide infomiation about the distance of each microbead from the focal plane. This information can be used to distinguish between spatially immobilised particles which are othenvise indistinguishable or result in the calculation of more than one distance matrix.<br>
One example of the correspondence problem is given in figure 10.<br>
Solution 2: Principal component prolection<br>
This solution is provided essentially by performing the method steps listed herein below:<br>
1.	Obtainlnganorthogonalpairof Images of each spatially encoded bead,<br>
2.	Determining the 2D-posltions of each spatially immobilised particle in each of said two orthogonal images,<br>
3.	Combining the resulting two orthogonal sets of 2D-positions whereby the set of possible sets of 3D-posltions Is obtained for each spatially encoded bead.<br><br>
4.	Calculating the principal component axis, x", y", z', of one of set of possible sets of 3D spatially immobilised particle positions.<br>
5.	Calculating the projected set of 3D spatially immobilised particle positions by projecting the 3D spatially immobilised particle positions.onto said principal component axis.<br>
6.	Calculating the projected distance matrix based on the projected set of 3D spatially immobilised particle positions.<br>
7.	ideniitying single spa^Hy encoded beads by comparing the M set of pro¬jected distance matrices of single spatially encoded beads against the full set of projected distance matrices of all spatially encoded beads. The best fit of single projected distance matrices hereby obtained identifies single spatially encoded beads.<br>
Encoded bead identification based on the principal component projected distance matrix is considerably more stable towards mismatching of spatially immobilised particles than encoded bead identification based on the conventional distance ma¬trix.<br>
Solution 3: Multiple distance matrix calculation<br>
A multiple distance matrix can be calculated by performing the steps of<br>
1.	Obtaining an orthogonal pair of images of each spatially encoded bead,<br>
2.	Determining the 2D-positions of each spatially immobilised particle in each of said two orthogonal images,<br>
3.	Combining the resulting two orthogonal sets of 2D-positions whereby the set of possible 3D-positions Is obtained for each spatially encoded bead.<br>
4.	Computing the set of distance matrices corresponding to the set of 30-positions thus determined.<br>
8.   Identifying single spatially encoded beads by comparing the full set of dis¬tance matrices of single spatially encoded beads against the full set of sets of distance matrices of all spatially encoded beads. The best fit of single distance matrices hereby obtained identifies single spatially encoded beads.<br><br>
Theoretical design crileria for identifying spatially encoded beads<br>
In order to demonstrate ttie versatility of the above methods, theoretical design crite¬ria for spatially encoded beads wilti optimal features for identification can be ob¬tained by<br>
1.	Forming a virtual set of spatially encoded beads in a computer on the basis of a set of spatially encoded bead properties, e.g., spatially encoded bead size distribution, spatially immobilised particle size distribution, and number of spatially immobilised particles per macrobead. Also, optical parameters should be included In the analysis, especially the uncertainty involved in the determination of the spatially immobilised particle positions,<br>
2.	Simulating random rotation of all spatially encoded beads,<br>
3.	Computing one pair of orthogonal projections of each of the spatially immo¬bilised particles of each spatially encoded bead,<br>
4.	Combining the two orthogonal sets of 20-positions whereby the set of possi¬ble 3D-positions Is obtained for each spatially encoded bead,<br>
5.	Computing the set of tiistance matrices corresponding to the set of 3€&gt;-positions thus determined,<br>
6.

The best fit of single distance matrices hereby obtained identifies single spatially encoded beads.<br>
7.	Registering the number of not-identified spatially encoded beads.<br>
8.	Varying one or more spatially encoded bead parameters and repeating the sequence 1 to 7 a one or more times.<br>
Finding theoretical encoded beads (EB) design criteria<br>
A virtual set of N = 5000 spatially encoded beads was formed in a computer with the use of a ft^atLab code. The following input parameters were used:<br>
Input paramelsr	gvmbol	Value	ynjl<br>
EB diameter	D	BOO	micrometers<br><br>
Spatially immobilised partlcie diameter       d	10	micrometers<br>
Number of spatially immobiiised	M	5<br>
particies per EB<br>
Standard deviatior of the error of the	5	4	micrometers<br>
spatiaiiy immobilised particle positions<br>
This virtual set of spatially encoded beads was fed to a MatLab code for multiple distance matrix identification, which gave rise to the following output parameters:<br>
Output parameter	Symbol        Value	Unit<br>
Number of spatiaiiy encoded beads<br>
with correspondence problem	C	458<br>
Number of ill-identified spatially	E	165<br>
encoded beads<br>
The number of spatially immobilised particles per spatially encoded bead, M, and the standard deviation of the error of the spatially immobilised particle positions, 5, were varied stepwise and fed to the multiple distance matrix ID code.<br>
The result in tenns of the number of spatially encoded beads with correspondence problem, C, and the number of ill-identified spatially encoded beads, E, is given in figure 11 where C and E are plotted against M and 5.<br>
It can be seen from the upper plot of Fig. 11 that the number of correspondence problems increases with increasing number of spatially immobilised particles and with the error associated with the deterniination of the relative spatially Immobilised particle positions as one would expect.<br>
The lower plot in Fig. 11 shows that in order to minimize the number of ill-identified spatially encoded bead, each spatially encoded bead should preferably comprise from 4 to 6 spatially Immobilised particles. However, other numbers are also possi-<br><br>
ble, such as from 3 to 8 spatially immobilised particles, for example 3 or 4 spatially Immobilised particles, such as from 6 to 8 spatially immobilised particles for example 3,4,5, 6,7, or 8 spatially Immobilised particles.<br>
At numbers of spatially immobilised particles below 4, the number of ill-Identified spatially encoded beads increases abruptly, and at numbers higher than 4 spatially immobilised particles, the number of iil-identified spatially encoded beads increases gradually. The plot further shows that the number of ill-identified spatially encoded beads gradually Increases with the positional error, and that the method breaks down when the positional error invoh/ed in the determination increases from 6 to 8 micrometers. These results can be used as design parameters for generating indi¬vidually identifiable, spatially encoded beads.<br>
For finding the 2D spatially immobilised particle-positions in images with the use of MatLab Imaging toolbox, it is possible to use e.g. a number of Gauss models, such as from 6 to 8 Gauss models, with same shape and varying size are applied to the image. For each Gauss model applied, one goodness-of-fit images are generated with the use of linear filtering. A new image is generated on the basis of the good¬ness-of-fit images as pixelwise maximum of the goodness-of-fit images. Tfie 2D spatially immobilised particle-positions can be found in this image as the positions of local maxima that have a goodness-of-fit value above a pre-set threshold value.<br>

Beaded polymer matrix<br>
It is one object of the present invention to provide an encoded, beaded or granulated polymer matrix for solid phase synthesis In the form of a bead or a granule com¬prising a plurality of spatially immobilised particles or vacuoles, wherein each parti¬cle or vacuole is individually detectable. The beaded matrix has different optical or spectroscopic properties from those ol the immobilised particles or vacuoles. The immobilised particles or vacuoles can be monodisperse or heterodisperse, and the Immobilised particles can be regular spherical beads or vacuoles, or they can be irregular particles. The beaded polymer matrix can be spherical, i.e. having a regu¬lar, rounded shape, or it can have an irregular shape In the form of a granule.<br>
Each beaded or granulated polymer matrix preferably comprises at least 2 particles, such as at least 3 particles, for example at least 4 particles, and preferably 10 or less particles, such as less than 5 particles. The particles can be essentially spheri¬cal, and preferably at least 2 such as 3, for example 5 of said particles have essen¬tially the same diameter. The particles are preferably essentially monodisperse and/or less than 10 micrometer in diameter, such as less than 5 micrometer in di¬ameter, for example less than 1 micrometer in diameter, such as less than 0.1 mi¬crometer In diameter.<br>
The present invention resides In one embodiment in a bead on which a compound can be synthesised, wherein the bead has at least two mariters integrally associated therewith, which markers are detectable and/or quantifiable during synthesis of the compound, The markers define a code identifj^ng the bead before, during and after synthesis of a compound. Through the use of its plurality of detectable and/or quan¬tifiable markers, preferably optically detectable and/or quantifiable markers, the bead of the present invention provides mere "pre-encoded" information compared to other beads of the prior art and thus provides larger combinational library sizes that can be encoded.<br>
This "pre-encoded" information may be read by specialized apparatus such as e.g. flow cytometers and the information can be used to track the synthetic history of an individual bead in a combinatorial process as described hereinafter. An example of a specialised apparatus for recording the "pre-encoded" infomiation contained in an<br><br>
encoded bead is the specialised encoded bead reader apparatus disclosed herein below.<br>
The larger the diversity of detectable and/or quantifiable markers of a bead, the greater the degree of decipherability or resolution of Ihe bead in a large population of beads. In this regard, each detectable and/or quantifiable marker of a bead pro¬vides at least a part of the information required to distinctively Identify the bead. The larger the number of such markers, the more detailed the identifying information that is compilable for a given bead, which may be used to distinguish tiiat bead from other beads. On the other hand the complication of detection is increased markedly with the number of markers.<br>
Markers<br>
The particles can comprise a mator, which is detectable by any fomi of electro¬magnetic radiation including fluorescent emmision. However, the marker can also be detected by fast spectroscopic techniques other than fluorescence spectroscopy, The particles of said beaded or granulated polymer matrix in one embodiment com¬prise a spectroscopioally detectable marker and/or a fluorescently detectable marker.<br>
Fluorescently detectable markers are preferably selected from the fluorescent group of compounds and materials consisting of fluorencent organic polycyclic com¬pounds, conjugated vinylic compounds, heterocyclic transition metal complexes, rare earth metal compounds, inorganic oxides and glasses.<br>
Fluorescently detectable markers can be detected by two photon fluorescence spectroscopy and/or by one photon fluorescence spectroscopy. RuorescenWy de¬tectable markers can additionally be detected by time-correlated photon fluores¬cence spectroscopy.<br>
Examples of detection by fast spectroscopic techniques other than fluorescence spectroscopy include, but is not limited to fast spectroscopic techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, visble light spectroscopy, UV spectnDS-copy, electron spin resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance.<br><br>
The fluorescently detectable marker is preferably selected from the group consisting ot dyes based on the structure of fluorescein, Oregon green, rtiodamrne. aminoben-zolc acid, Alexa™ probes, BODlPY-dyes, cascade blue dye, coumarine, naphthale¬nes, dansyl, indoles, pyrenes pyridyloxazole, cascade yellow dye, Dapoxyl Dye, Fluorescamine, aromatic ortho dialdehydes, OPA and NDA, ATTO-Tag's, 7-Nitrobenz-2-0xa-1,3-Diazole or derivatives thereof. The fluorescently detectable marker in one embodiment is preferably a UV or visible light-excitable microsphere.<br>
Fluorescent dyes may be incorporated into beads by any suitable method known in the art, such as copoiymerlsation of a polymerlsabie monomer and a dyecontaining co-monomer or addition of a suitable dye derivative in a suitable organic solvent to an aqueous suspension as for example disclosed in Singer et al., (supra including references cited therein), Campian et al. (1994, In'innovation and Perspectives on Solid Phase Synthesis"Epton, R., Birmingham: Mayflower, 469-472, incorporated herein by reference) and Egner et al. (1997, Chem. Commun. 73 5-73 6, incorpo¬rated herein by reference). Alternatively, fluorescent beads may be produced having at least one fluorescent spherical zone. Such particles may be prepared as for ex¬ample described In U. S. Patent No. 5,786,219 (Zhang et al.), which is incorporated herein by reference. In a preferred embodiment, one or more fluorescent dyes are incorporated wthin a micnDparticle. Compared to surface attachment of fluorescent dyes, incorporation of dyes within beads reduces the physical exposure of the fluo¬rescent dye (s) to various solvents used in combinatorial synthesis and thus in¬creases the stability of the beadfluorescent dye complexes.<br>
Also included in the present invention are markers which are detectable by fast de¬tection techniques other than spectroscopy, such as light scattering, reflection, dif¬fraction or light rotation.<br>
Electromagnetic radiation-related markers are preferably selected from the group consisting of fluorescence emission, luminescence, phosphorescence, infrared ra¬diation, elsctromagnetic scattering including light and X-ray scattering, light trans-mittance, light absorbance and electrical impedance.<br><br>
Preferably, the electromagnetic radiation-related marker Is a light emitting, light transmitting or light absorbing marker detectable by illuminating the particle with incident light of one or more selected wavelengths or ot one or more selected vec¬tors.<br>
It Is preferred that at least one of the mariners of a bead is an electromagnetic radia¬tion-related marker suitably selected from the group consisting of atomic or molecu¬lar fluorescence emission, luminescence, phosphorescence, infrared radiation, electromagnetic scattering including light and X-ray scattering, light transmittance, light absorbance and electrical impedance.<br>
The fluorescence emission can result from e.g. excitation of one or more fluorescent markers attached to, or contained within, the bead. In the case of two or more fluo¬rescent markers being utilised, the markers can be the same and the markers can comprise the same or varying amounts of a ftuorophore. In the latter case the mark¬ers are intensity-differentiated.<br>
Aftematively, the markers may be different wherein they are present in a ratio of 1; 1 or varying ratios. Reference may be made in this regard to WO 95/32425 which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Exemplary fluorophores which may be used in accordance with the present inven¬tion include those listed in WO 93/06121, which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Any suitable fluorescent dye may be used for incorporation into the bead of the in¬vention. For example, reference may be made to U. S. Patents 5,573,909 (Singer et al., which is incorporated herein by reference) and 5,326,692 (Brinkley et al., which is incorporated herein by reference) which describe a plethora of fluorescent dyes. Reference may also be made to fluorescent dyes described in U. S. Patent Nos. 5,227,487.5,274,113, 5,405,975, 5,433,896, 5,442,045, 5,451,663, 5,453,517, 5,459,276, 5,516,864, 5,648,270 and 5,723,218, which are all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, one or more of the fluorescent markers can preferably be incor¬porated into a microparticle, such as a polymeric microparlicia, or a ceramic micro-<br><br>
particle. Such microparticles can preferably be attached to a bead by use of e.g. colloidal interactions as for example disclosed by Trau and Bryant in PCT/AU98/00944, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When the marker is spectroscoplcaily detectable, there is in one embodiment pro¬vided a marker capable ot being probed by a range of frequencies differing by less than about 20%, such as less than about 10%, based on the numerical highest fre¬quency value. The marker can also be probed by one or more predetermined fre¬quencies.<br>
Any suitable method of analysing fluorescence emission is encompassed by the present invention. In this regard, the invention contemplates techniques including, but not restricted to, 2-photon and 3-photon time resolved fluorescence spectros¬copy as for example disclosed by Lakowicz et al. (1997, Biophys. J., 72; 567, incor¬porated herein by reference), fluorescence lifetime imaging as for example disclosed by Eriksson et al. {1993, Biophys. J., 2: 64, incorporated herein by reference), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer as for example disclosed by Youvan et al. (1997, Biotechnology et alia 3:1-18).<br>
Luminescence and phosphorescence may result respectively from a suitable lumi¬nescent or phosphorescent label as is known in the art. Any optical means of iden¬tifying such label may be used in this regard.<br>
Infrared radiation may result from a suitable infrared dye. Exemplary infrared dyes that may be employed in the invention Include, but are not restricted to, those dis¬closed In Lewis et at. (1999, Dyes Pigm. 42 (2): 197), Tawa et al. (1998, Mater. Res. Soc. Symp. Proc. 488 (Electrical, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Organic Solid-State Materials IV). 885-890), Daneshvar, et al. (1999, J. Immunol. Methods 226 (1-2): 119-128), Rapaport et al, (1999, AppI, Phys. Lett. 74 (3): 329-331) and Durig et al. (1993, J. Raman Spectrcsc. 24 (5); 281 -5), which are incorporated herein by ref¬erence. Any suitable infrared spectroscopic method may be employed to interrogate the infrared dye. For instance, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as for exam¬ple described by Rahman et al. (1998, J. Org. Chem., 63; 6196, incorporated herein by reference) may be used rn this regard.<br><br>
Suitably, electromagnatic scattering may result from diffraction, reflection, polarisa¬tion or refraction of the incident electromagnetic radiation including light and Xrays. In this regard, the beads may be formed of different materials to provide a set of beads with varying scattering properties such as different refractive indexes as for example described supra. Any suitabie art recognised metliod of detecting and/or quantifying electromagnetic scatter may be employed. In this regard, the invention also contemplates methods employing contrast variation in light scattering as, for example, described in van Holden and Vrij (1980, Journal of Colloidal and Interface Science 76; 419-433), which is Incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Markers other than electromagnetic radiation-related markers can be utilised, op¬tionally in combination with electromagnetic radiation-related markers. Such markers include e.g. size and/or shapd of the bead, For example, beads may be shaped in the form of spheres, cubes, rectangular prisms, pyramids, cones, ovoids, sheets or cylinders, including intermediate forms as well as irregular shapes. Electrical imped¬ance across a bead may be measured to provide an estimate of the bead volume (Coulter).<br>
The marker in one embodiment comprises a chromophoric label. Suitable beads comprising such chromophores are described e.g. by Tentorio et al. (1980, Journal of Colloidal and Interface Science 77:419-426), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A suitable method tor non-destructive analysis of organic pigments and dyes, using a Raman microprobe, microfluorometer or absorption microspectrophotometer, is decribed for example in Guineau, B. (1989, Cent. Rech. Consen/. Documents Graph., GNRS, Paris, Fr. Stud. Conserv 34 (1}: 38-44), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the marker may comprise a magnetic material inclusive of iron and magnetite, or an marker that is detectable by acoustic backscatter as is known in the art.<br>
it will be understood from the foregoing that the number of beads having different<br><br>
detectable codes will be dependent on the number of difterenl delectable and/or quantifiable markers integrally associated with the beads.<br>
Polymers<br>
Polymers according to the present Invention are preferably optically transparent in tfie optical exitation range of the fluorescent marker and/or the emission wavelength range of the fluorescent marker comprised by the particles and/or vacuoles of the polymer matrix.<br>
Polymer beads according to the invention can be prepared from a variety of polym-erisable monomers, Including styrenes, acrylates and unsaturated chlorides, esters, acetates, amides and alcohols, including, but not limited to, polystyrene (including high density polystyrene latexes such as bromlnated polystyrene), polymethyl¬methacrylate and other poiyacrylio acids, polyaorylonitrile, polyacrylamide, poly-acrolein, polydimethylsiloxane, polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polyurethane, polyvi-nylacetate, polyvinylchloride, polyvin^pyridine, polyvinylbenzylchloride, polyvinyl-toluene, polyyinylidenechloride and polydivinylbenzene, as well as PEGA, SPOCC and POEPOP. The beads may be prepared from styrene monomers or PEG based marcromonomers.<br>
The polymer is in preferred embodiments selected from the group consisting of polyethers, polyvinyls,'polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyacylamides, polyure-thanes, polyacrylamldes, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyesters, polyamides, and combinations threreof.<br>
In more preferred embodiments, the polymer is selected from the group consisting of SPOCC, PEGA, HYDRA, POEPOP, PEG-polyacrylate copolymers, polyether-polyamine copolymers, crosslinked polyethylene diamines, and combinations thereof.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to the above polymers as the beads can In principle comprise any solid, at least partly transparent material capable of providing a base for combinatorial synthesis. As illustrative examples, the beads can be poly¬meric supports such as polymeric beads, which are preferably formed from polysty-<br><br>
rene cross-linked with 1 -5% dlvinylbenzene. Polymeric beads can also be formed from hexamethylenediaminepolyacryl resins and related polymers, poly N- {2- (4-hydroxylphenyl) ethyl} acrylamide {i. e., {one Q)), silica, cellulose beads, polystyrene beads poly (haiomethylstyrene) beads, poly (haiostyrene) beads, poly (acetoxysty-rene) beads, latex beads, grafted copolymer beads such as polyethylene gly-col/polystyrene, porous silicates for example controlled poreglass beads, polyacry-lamide beads for example poly (acryloylsarcosine methyl ester) beads, dimethy-lacrylamide beads optionally cross-linked with N, N'-bis-acrylolyl ethylene diamine, glass particles coated with a hydrophobic polymer inclusive of cross-linked polysty¬rene or a fluorinated ethylene polymer which provides a material having a rigid or semi-rigid surface, poly (N-actyloylpyrrolidine) resins, Wang resins, Pam resins, Merrifield resins, PAP and SPARE polyamide resins, polyethylene functionalised with acrylic acid, kieselguhr/polyamide {Pepsyn K), polyHipeTM, PS/polydimethylacry)amide copolymers, CPG, PS macrobeads and TentagelTM, PEG-PS/DVB copolymers,<br>
Ceramic beads may be comprised of silica, alumina, titania or any other suitable transparent material. A suitable method of making silica beads is described, for ex¬ample in'The Colloid Chemistry of Silica and Silicates" (Cornell University Press) by Ralph K Her 1955 and U. S. Patent No 5,439,624, the disclosures of which are in¬corporated herein by reference. Reference may also be made to W095/25737 and W097/15390, incorporated herein by reference, which disclose examples of such beads.<br>
The beaded polymer matrix according to the invention preferably has a ratio R = a/b between a) the volume of the beaded or granulated polymer matrix and b) the aver¬age volume of the particles which is in the range of from 10000000:1 to 10:1, such as in the range of from 1000000:1 to 30:1, for example in the range of from 1000000:1 to 100:1, for example In the range of from 1000000:1 to 200:1, such as in the range of from 1000000:1 to 1000:1, forexample in the range of from 100000:1 to 1000:1, such as in the range of from 10OO0O:1 to 2000:1.<br>
Independently of the above ratios, the beaded or granulated polymer matrix ac¬cording to the invention preferably comprises an average volume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.000001 nL - 50 \i]_, such as an average volume of the<br><br>
swelled bead or granule of from 0.00001 ΜL - 5 μL, for example an average volume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.001 μL -1 μl, such as an average volume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.01μL - 0.1 μ,L.<br>
Any combination of the above falls within ttie invention and accordingly, for a ratio R = a/b between a) the volume of the beaded or granulated polymer matrix and b) the average volume of the particles which is in the range of from 10000000:1 to 10:1, such asin the range of from 1000000:1 to 30:1,forexampleinthe range of from 1000000:1 to 100:1, for example in the range of from 1000000:1 fo 200:1, such as in the range of from 1000000:1 to 1000:1, for example In the range of from 100000:1 to 1000:1, such as in the range of from 100000:1 to 2000:1, the average volume of the swelled bead or granule can be from 0.000001 1μL  - 50 1μL . such as an average vol¬ume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.00001 1μL  - 5 1μL , for example an aver¬age volume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.0011μL  -1μL , such as an av¬erage volume of the swelled bead or granule of from 0.01 1μL  - 0.1 1μL .<br>
Composition comprising a plurality of encoded, beaded polymer matrices<br>
The invention is in one embodiment directed to a plurality of beads comprising a population that Is pre-encoded. Accordingly, each bead of that population has a code, which distinctively Identifies a respective bead before, during and after said synttiesis tram other beads. The diversity of the said population of beads, therefore, resides in beads of said population having relative to each other different spatial locations of detectable markers, which are used to provide distinctive codes for de¬tection of each of those beads.<br>
The composition of beads of the invention may be used in many applications, such as affinity chromatography for purification and/or isolation of desirable target com¬pounds, and combinatorial chemistry procedures that do or do not involve a split-and-combine procedure. Preferably, however, such assemblies are used in combi¬natorial chemistries, which involve a split-process-recombine procedure.<br>
A plurality of beads according to the invention may be prepared by any suitable method. Preferably, when colloidal particles including polymeric and ceramic parti-<br><br>
cles are used as beads, the colloid dispersion of such beads is stabilised, Exem¬plary methods imparting colloidal stabilisation are described for example in Hunter, R. J. (1986, "Foundation of Colioid Science', Oxford University Press, Melbourne) and Napper, D. H. (1983,'Polymeric stabilisation of Colloidal Dispersions'Academic Press, London), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. In this regard, the most widely exploited effect of nonionic polymers on colloid stability is steric stabilisation, in which stability is imparted by polymer molecules that are absorbed onto, or attached to, the surface of the colloid particles. Persons of skill in the art will recognise that it is possible to impart stability by combinations of different stabilisation mechanisms: e. g., surface charge on the particles can impact colloidal stability via electrostatic stabilisation, and an attached polyelectrolyte can impart stability by a combination of electrostatic and staric mechanisms (elactrosteric stabi¬lisation). Polymer that is in free solution can also influence colloid stability. Stabilisa¬tion by free polymer is well-documented (Napper 1983, supra) and is called deple¬tion stabilisation.<br>
Preferably, steric stabilisation of colloid dispersions is employed. In this regard, steric stabilisation is widely exploited because it offers several distinct advantages over eloctrostatic stabilisation. For example, one advantage is that aqueous stari-cally stabilised dispersions are comparatively insensitive to the presence of electro¬lytes because the dimensions of non-ionic chains vary relatively little witfi the elec¬trolyte concentration.<br>
Any suitable stabilising moiety may be used for stabilising colloidal dispersions. Ex¬emplary stabilising moieties that impact on colloidal stability are given herein below: Poly (oxyethyiene), Poly (vinyl alcohol), Poly (acrylic acid), Poly (acrylamide), and sorbitol monolaurate as well as commonly used emulsion stabilizers,<br>
The composition of encoded, beads preferably comprises at least 102 individually identifiable beads, such as at least 103 individual[y identifiable beads, for example at least 10^ individually identifiable beads, such as at least 10' individually identifiable beads, for example at least 10° individually identifiable beads, such as at least 1011 individually identifiable beads, for example at least 1013 individually identifiable beads, such as at least 1015 individually identifiable beads, for example at least 10" individually identifiable beads, such as at least 1o' individually identifiable beads,<br><br>
for example at least 1021 individually identifiable beads, such as at least 1023 indi¬vidually identifiable beads.<br>
Methods for generating a composition comprising encoded beads<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for generating a composi¬tion comprising a plurality of encoded, beaded polymer matrices, said method com¬prising the steps of<br>
1)        synthesizing a monomer and/or macromonomer and a crosslinker for polym¬erization, and,<br>
ii)       mixing the monomer and/or macromonomer with particles to give an even dispersion of particles in the mixture, and<br>
ili)       polymerizing the monomer and/or macromonomer by either i) suspension polymerisation and/or; ii) Inverse suspension polymerisation and/or iii) bulk polymerisation followed by granulation and/or iv) droplet polymerisation.<br>
In a further aspect there is provided a method tor generating a composition com¬prising a plurality of encoded, beaded polymer matrices, and detecting and/or iden¬tifying individually identifiable beads, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	preparing a plurality of beads comprising spatially immobilised particles com-pri^g at least one marker;<br>
(b)	detecting and/or quantifying the said markers of each bead and assigning a code, such as the result of a detennination of the location of spatially encoded parti¬cles or vacuoles, for each bead;<br>
(c)	identifying beads having distinctive codes; and optionally<br>
(d)	identifying beads having similar codes; and further optionally<br>
(e)	sorting the beads having distinctive codes from the beads having non distinctive codes to thereby provide an encoded, beaded polymer matrix.<br>
There Is also provided the use of such a composition comprising a plurality of en¬coded, beaded polymer matrices linked to a bioactive compound for identifying bio-<br><br>
active compound binding partners, and a use of the composition of beads linked to different bioactive compounds for diagnostic purposes, wherein the binding and de¬termination of a predetermined binding partner to a substrate or bioactive compound on the carrier is at ieast indicative of a positive diagnosis.<br>
Bioactive compounds of particular interest are e.g. those which may be so screened include agonists and antagonists for cell membrane receptors, toxins, venoms, viral epitopes, hormones, sugars, co-factors, peptides, enzyme substrates, drugs inclu¬sive of opiates and steroids, proteins including antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, antisera reactive with specific antigenic detemiinants, nucleic acids, lectins, poly¬saccharides, cellular membranes and organelles.<br>
The present Invention also encompasses as bioactive compounds a plurality of unique polynucleotide or oligonucleotide sequences for sequence by hybridisation (SBH) or gene expression analyses. Persons of skill In the art will recognise that SBH uses a set of short oligonucleotide probes of defined sequence to search for complementary sequences on a longer target strand of DNA. The hybridisation pat¬tern Is used to reconstruct the target DNA sequence. Accordingly, In the context of the present invention, an aqueous solution of fluorescently labelled single stranded DNA (ssDNA) of unknown sequence may be passed over the library of poiynucieo-tide or oligonucleotide compounds and adsorption (hybridisation) of the ssDNA will occur only on beads which contain polynucleotide or oligonucleotide sequences complementary to those on the ssDNA. These beads may be identified, for example, by flow cytometry, fluorescence optical microscopy or any other suitable technique.<br>
Once a compound having the desired activity is obtained, the sequence of reaction steps experienced by the bead on which the compound was synthesised may be deconvoluted simply by analysing the tracking data for that bead as described, for example, hereinafter. The sequence of building blocks defining the compound of interest may thus be ascertained and a molecule comprising this sequence can by synthesised by conventional means (e. g., amino acid synthesis or oligonucleotide synthesis) as is known in the art.<br>
Encoded beads can be sorted according to at least one optical parameter, i.e., a physical property that influences the optical signal arising from the encoded bead.<br><br>
such as size and shape and number of particles per encoded bead, whereby it is obtained that the resulting encoded beads are individually identifiable by optical means. Preferred means for sorting encoded beads include sedimentation, centrifu-gatron, sieving, cyclone seperalton, total fluorescence separation, and separation according to number of particles per encoded bead, Total fluorescence separation can be carried out on a so-called bead sorter, such as the COP ASTm systenx sup¬plied by Union Blometrica. Separation according to number of particles per encoded bead can be carried out with an encoded bead reader, such as disclosed above, equipped with a fast image processing system for counting the number of particles per encoded bead on the basis of the images and further equipped with a switchable valve positioned downstream from the flow cell for sorting the encoded beads.<br>
it is essential that that the optical properties of said particles differ from the optical properties of said beaded polymer matrix, whereby it is obtained that the relative positions of said particles of said encoded beaded polymer matrix can be deter¬mined.<br>
The polymerisation reaction can preferably be a radical initiated chain polymerisa¬tion reaction, or an anion initialed ring opening polymerisation reaction, or a cation initiated ring opening polymerisation reaction.<br>
Functional groups on the beads can subsequently be reacted with different bioactive compound building blocks as described herein elsewhere. Each reaction step can be monitored as essentially each bead of the encoded, beaded polymer matrix is individually detectable. The below methods describe in more detail the identification of spatially immobilised particles or beads in the beads or granules.<br>
Sorting spaliallv Immobilised particles acconJino to size and coritrollina the size dis¬tribution of spatially ImmQbilised particles.<br>
Particles may be sorted according to at least one optical parameter, i.e., a physical property that influences the optical signal arising from the particle, such as size, shape, colour, or fluorescence, whereby it is obtained that the relative positions of said particles can be determined by optical means. Preferred means for sorting par¬ticles include sedimentation, centrifugation, sieving, and cyclone separation.<br><br>
Using spatially immobilised particles as particles in encoded beads places some limitations on the size of the spatially immobtiised particles. Too large spatially im¬mobilised particles tens to shadow each other and too small spatially Immobilised particles may pass through the optical set-up unnoticed. Generally the size distribu¬tion of spatially immobilised particles synthesized by suspension polymerisation or emulsion polymerization is very broad. Hence, a method for obtaining a fraction of spatially immobilised particles with controlled size distribution is required.<br>
It has been found that the micro beads In di-methylfonnamide (DMF) solution after centrifugation at 250rpm for 22min are considerably smaller than the micro beads in the sediment. This indicates that it is possible to remove small beads by repeated centrifugation at 250rpm and removing the liquid phase after each njn, i.e. the con¬centration of small beads in the sediment should decrease after each run. Figure 13 shows micrographs of suspension polymerised micro beads before centrifugation and after 5 limes centrifugation at 250rpm for 22min. A change in the size distribu¬tion towards a more narrow distribution and a higher average micro bead diameter appears from the micrographs. The size distribution was measured within a rectan¬gular section of each Image with the use of imaging software. Figure 14 shows the measured size distributions. It is clear from the figure that a more narrow size distri¬bution and a larger average diameter are obtained by the method.<br>
Method for identifyinQ Individual spatially encoded, beads in a composition compris¬ing such spatially encoded beads<br>
In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for identifying at (east one Individually identifiable, spatiaily encoded beaded polymer matrix, said method comprising the steps of<br>
i)        detemiining the unique, spatial immobilisation of a plurality of particles in the at least one bead to be identified, and<br>
li)        Identifying said at least one individually identifiable, spatially encoded<br>
beaded polymer matrix based on said unique detennination of said spatiaily immobilised plurality of particles.<br><br>
Post identification of spatially encoded beads<br>
The sequence comprising 1) determination of tlie spatially Immobilised particle posi¬tions in the images, 2) calculation of the corresponding set of possible 3D-posi«ons of the spatially immobiHsed pariides and the corresponding distance matrices, and 3) the distance matrix based Identification, may be too time consuming to allow for on-line identification of encoded beads, instead post Identification of "hits", i.e., spa¬tially encoded beads carrying compounds which are of interest in a given assay, as illustrated in Fig. 15.<br>
As the hits are not identified until after the full combinatorial chemistry synthesis, the hit ID will have to be carried out after the combinatorial synthesis process has been finished. Following a procedure comprising the following steps can do this:<br>
1.	A plurality of spatiaily encoded polymer beads is synthesized<br>
2.	Images or laser scans of each encoded bead is recorded and stored as thd beads are being split into a number of jars, J,, Jj... j| in which jars one combinatorial synthesis step is carried out,<br>
3.	All beads are pooled<br>
4.	Tfie sequence comprising steps 2 and 3 is repeated a number of times.<br>
5.	All spatially encoded beads are screened In a given assay and the hits are sepa¬rated<br>
6.	The jar sequence of each hit is determined on the basis of the recondings ob¬tained under step 2 and the use of an ID method.<br>
Method for aenerating an encocjed. beaded polymer matrix comprising different bjo-active compounds<br>
It Is a yet further object of the invention to provide a method for generating an en¬coded, beaded polymer matrix comprising a bioaciive compound, wherein essen-tlally each bead of the polymer matrix is individually Identifiable, said method com¬prising the steps of<br><br>
i)        spatially immobilizing particles In polymer beads or granulates, and<br>
ii)       isolating encoded beads or granules by automated sorting, and<br>
iii)       recording and storing the distance matrix for essentially each bead or gran¬ule, and<br>
iv)      performing a stepwise synthesis of bloactive compounds by reacting func¬tional groups of the encoded beads or granules vjrth at least one building blocl
v)       recording the identity of each bead or granule that enter each reaction step iv), and<br>
vi)       isolating beads or granules of interest, preferably by perfonning an assay or a diagnostic screen, and<br>
vii)      identifying the bloactive compound attached to at least one individual bead by recording the identity of at least one isolated bead or granule, and option¬ally comparing said recording with the recording, preferably a distance ma¬trix, recorded for at least a plurality of the remaining beads or granules.<br>
A binding assay for characterising or isolating bloactive compounds bound to the beads or granules can be perfomied by measuring e.g. the binding of a protein to a ligand bound to the polymer matrix. Also, an assay can be performed by measuring e.g. an enzyme activity on a substrate bound to the polymer matrix. It is also possi¬ble to perform an assay by measuring e.g. enzyme Inhibition of a molecule bound to the polymer matrix, or to perform an assay by measuring e.g. receptor irrteraction with a bioactive compound bound to tlie polymer matrix.<br>
For the above methods, the plurality of particles preferably comprise a fluorescently detectable marker, such as a fluorescently detectable marker detectable by two photon fluorescence microscopy, or a fluorescently detectable marlter detectable by one photon fluorescence microscopy.<br><br>
Method for deconvoluting a converrtiona library<br>
In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for synthesising and deconvo¬luting a combinatorial library comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	apportioning in a stochastic manner among a plurality of reaction vessels a plurality of beads on which a plurality of different compounds can be synthesised, wherein said plurality of beads comprises a population of detectably distinct beads each having a code, such as spatially immobilised particles or vacuoles, which dis-tincstively identifies aiespective bead before, during and after said synthesis from other beads,<br>
(b)	detennining and recording the codes, preferably in the form of the spatial posi¬tion of the immobilised particles or vacuoles, of said plurality of beads In order to track the movement of individual detectably distinct beads into particular reaction vessels of said plurality of reaction vessels, wherein said codes are determined prior to step (d);<br>
(c)	reacting the beads in each reaction vessel with a building bloclc;<br>
(d)	pooling the beads from each reaction vessel;<br>
(e)	apportioning the beads in a stochastic manner among the plurality of reaction vessels;<br>
(f)	reacting the beads in each reaction vessel with another building block;<br>
(g)	recording the codes of said plurality of beads in order to track the movement<br>
of Individual detectably distinct beads into particular reaction vessels of said plurality of reaction vessels, wherein said codes are recorded after step (e) and/or step (f); (h) pooling the beads from each reaction vessel;<br>
(i) iterating steps (e) through (h) as required in order to create a combinatorial compound library wherein member compounds of the library are associated with the detectably distinct beads and wherein codes of the detectably distinct beads are deconvolutable using tracking data provided by said recordal steps to identify the sequence of reactions experienced by the said detectably distinct beads.<br><br>
The identification steps (step (c) and (d)) may be effected by use of any suitabie method or apparatus for analysing the spatiaiiy immobilised markers of a bead.<br>
Preferably, these steps are effected by flow cytometry, which typically detects opti¬cal parameters. For example, a flow cytometer may be used to determine forward scatter (which is a measure of size of a bead), side scatter (which is senstive to refractive index and size of a particle (seen Shapiro 1995,'Practicalflow cytometry", 3d ed. Brisbane, Wiley-LIss)), and fluorescent emission.<br>
Any suitable algorithm may be employed to track and/or sort individual detectably unique beads. Preferably, a real-time algorithm is employed.<br>
Suitably, ttie step of sorting (step (e)) is characterised in that the population of de¬tectably distinct beads constitutes at least about 50%, preferably at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95% of the plurality of beads resulting from step (e).<br>
From the foregoing, a population of detectably unique beads can be generated from a raw population of beads using e.g. specialised flow cytometric techniques. The population of detectably unique beads is thereby "pre-encoded" and can be used for combinatorial synthesis.<br>

Reference may also be made to Patel et at., (April 1996, DDT 1 (4); 134-144) who describe the manufacture or syndesis of N-substituted glycines, polycarbarnates, msrcaptoacylprolines, diketopiperazines, HIV protease inhibitors, 1-3 diols, hy-droxystilbenes, B-lactams, 1,4-benzodlazepine-2-5-diones, dihydropyridlnes and dihydropyrimidines.<br><br>
Reference may also be made to synthesis of polyketldes as discussed, for example, in Rohr {1995, Angew, Int. Ed, Engl. 34: 881-884).<br>
Chemical or enzymatic synthesis of the compound libraries of the present Invention takes place on beads. Thus, those of skill in the art will appreciate that the materials used to construct the beads are limited primarily by their capacity for derivttisation to attach any of a number of chemically reactive groups and compatibility with the chemistry of compound synthesis. Except as otherwise noted, the chemically reac¬tive groups with which such beads may be derivatised are those commonly used for solid state synthesis of the respective compound and thus wilt be well known to those skilled in the art. For example, these bead materials may be derivatised to contain functionalities or linkers including-NH2, -NHNH2, -0NH2, -COOH, -SH, -SeH, -S03H, -GeH, or -SiR2H groups.<br>
Linkers for use with the beads may be selected from base stable anchor groups as described in Table 2 of Fruchtel et al. {1996, supra, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) or add stable anchor groups as described in Ta¬ble 3 of Fruchtel et al. (1996, supra). Suitable linkers are also described in W093/06121, which is incorporated herein t&gt;y reference.<br>
In the area of peptide synthesis, anchors developed for peptide chemistry are stable to either bases or weak acids, but for the most part, they are suitable only for the immobilisation of carboxylic acids. However, for the reversible attachment of special functional groups, known anchors have to be derivatised and optimised or, when necessary, completely new anchors must be developed. For example, an anchor group for immobilisation of alcohols is (6 hydroxymethyl)-3,4 dihydro-2H-pyran, whereby the sodium salt is covalently bonded to chloromethylated Merrifieldz resin by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. The alcohol is coupled to the support by electrophilic addition in the presence of pyridinlum toluene-4 sulphonate (PPTS) In dichloromethane. The resulting tetrahydropyranyi ether is stable to base but can be cleaved by transetherlfication with 95% trifluoroacetic acid. Benzyl halides may be coupled to a photolabile sulfanyi-substituted phenyl ketone anchor.<br>
It will also be appreciated that compounds prepared with the beads and/or process<br><br>
of the present invention may bs screened for an activity of interest by methods well known in the art. For example, such screening can be effected by specialised flow cytometry invented from standard techniques such as described e.g. by Needels et ai. (1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 90:1070010704, incorporated herein by refer¬ence), Dower et ai. (supra), and Kaye and Tracey (WO 97/15390, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Svnthesis of a combinatorial Compound library<br>
A combinatorial library in accordance with the present inventlonis a collection of multiple species of chemical compounds comprised of smaller subunits or mono¬mers. Combinatorial libraries come in a variety of sizes, ranging trom a few hundred to many hundreds of thousand different species of chemical compounds. There are also a variety of library types, iricluding oligomeric and polymeric libraries comprised of compounds such as peptides, carbohydrates, oligonucleotides, and small organic molecules, etc. Such libraries have a variety of uses, such as immobilization and chromatographic separation of chemical compounds, as well as uses for identifying and characterizing ligands capable of binding an acceptor molecule or mediating a biological activity of interest.<br>
The library compounds may comprise any type of molecule of any type of subunits or monomers, including small molecules and polymers wherein the monomers are chemically connected by any sort of chemical bond such as covalent, ionic, coordi¬nation, chelation bonding, etc., which those skilled in the art will recognize can be synthesized on a solid-phase support<br>
The term polymer as used herein includes those compounds conventionally called heteropolymers, i.e., arbilrartly large molecules composed of varying monomers, wherein the monomers are linked by means of a repealing chemical bond or stnjc-ture. The polymers of the invention of this types are composed of at least two sub-units or monomers that can include any bl-functional organic or herteronuclear molecule Including, but not limited to amino acids, amino hydroxyls, amino isocya-nates, diamines, hydroxycarboxylic acids, oxycarbonylcarboxyllc acids, aminoaide-hydes, nilroamines, thioaikyls, and haloalkyis.<br><br>
In the disclosure of the present Invention, the terms "monomer," "subunlts" and •building blocks" will be used interchangeably to mean any type of chemical building block of molecule that may be formed upon a solid-phass support. The libraries are not limited to libraries of polymers, but is also directed to libraries of scaffolded small molecules.<br>
Various techniques for synthesizing libraries of compounds on solid-phase supports are known in the art Solid-phase supports are typically polymeric objects with sur¬faces that are functional ized to bind with subunlts or monomers to form the com¬pounds of the library, Synthesis of one library typically involves a large number of solid-phase supports.<br>
To make a combinatorial library, solid-phase supports are reacted with a one or more subunlts of the compounds and with one or more numbers of reagents in a carefully controlled, predetemnined sequence of chemical reactions. In other words, the library subunlts are "grown" on the solid-phase supports. The (arger the library, the greater the number of reactions required, complicating the task of keeping track of the chemical composition of the multiple species of compounds that make up the library. Thus, it Is important to have methods and apparatuses which facilitate the efficient production of large numbers of chemical compounds, yet allow convenient tracking of the compounds over a number of reaction steps necessary to make the compounds.<br>
Combinatorial libraries represent an important tool for the identification of e.g. small organic molecules that affect specific biological functions. Due to the Interaction of the small molecules with particular biological targets and their ability to affect spe¬cific biological lunctions, they may also serve as candidates for the development of therapeutics. Accordingly, small molecules can be useful as drug leads eventually resulting in the development of therapeutic agents.<br>
Because It is difficult to predict which small molecules will interact with a biological target, intense efforts have been directed towards the generation of large numbers, or "libraries", of small organic compounds. These libraries can then be linked to sensitive screens to identify the active molecules,<br><br>
A number of libraries have been designed to mimic one or more features of natural peptides. Such peptidomimetic libraries include phthalimido libraries (WO 97/22594), thiophene libraries (WO 97/40034), benzodiazopene libraries (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), libraries formed by the sequential reaction of dienes (WO 96/03424), thilazolidlnone libraries, libraries of metathiazanones and their derivatives (U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,974), and azatide libraries (WO 97/35199) (for review of pepti¬domimetic technologies, see Gante, J., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994, 33,1699-1720 and references cited therein).<br>
The present invention also resides in a method of synthesising and deoonvoluting a combinatorial library as described herein above. The codes of the plurality of beads are determined preferably before the first reaction step, although codes may be de¬termined at any time before the first pooling step (step (d), cf. method steps cited above).<br>
Preferably, every time the plurality of beads is apportioned into reaction vessels, each one of the vessels is analysed to determine which of the detectabiy distinct beads are in each reaction vessel. A database of all the beads (or corresponding gridspaces, supra) can thus be updated to show the synthetic history of the com¬pound synthesised on each bead.<br>
During a reaction step, the beads in each reaction vessel are reacted with a building block required to assemble a particular compound. Assembly of compounds from many types of building bloclcs requires use of the appropriate coupling chemistry for a given set of building blocks. Any set of building blocks that can be attached to one another in a step-by-step fashion can serve as the building block set. Tfie attach¬ment may be mediated by chemical, enzymatic, or other means, or by a combination of these. The resulting compounds can be linear, cyclic, branched, or assume vari¬ous other confonnations as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, techniques for solid state synthesis of polypeptides are described, for example, in lylerrifield (1963, J, Amer. Chem. Soc. 35: 2149-2156). Peptide coupling chemistiy is also described in"The Peptides", Vol. 1, (eds. Gross, E., and J. lyleienhofer). Academic Press, Orlando (1979), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
To synthesise the compounds, a large number of the beads are apportioned among<br><br>
a number of reaction vessels, In each reaction, a different building block is coupled to the growing oligomer chain. The building blocks may be of any type that can be appropriateiy activated for chemical coupling, or any type that will be accepted for enzymatic coupling.<br>
Because the reactions may be contained in separate reaction vessels, even building blCGl(s with different coupling chemistries can be used to assemble the ollgomeric compounds (see, The Peptides, op. cit). The coupling time for some of the building block sets may be long. For this reason the preferred arrangement is one in whicli the building block reactions are carried out in parallel. After each coupling step, the beads on which are synthesised the oligomers or compounds of the library are pooled and mixed prior to re-allocation to the individual vessels for the next coupling step. This shuffling process produces beads with many oligomer sequence combi¬nations. If each synthesis step has high coupling efficiency, substantially all the oli¬gomers on a single bead will have the same sequence. That sequence is deter¬mined by the synthesis pathway (building blockreactions and the order of reactions experienced by the beads) for any given bead, The maximum length of the oli¬gomers may be about 50, preferably from 3 to 8 building blocks in length, and In some cases a length of 10 to 20 residues is prefen-ed. Protective groups known to those skilled in the art may be used to prevent spurious coupling (see. The Pep¬tides, Vol. 3, (eds. Gross, E., and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, Orlando (1981), which Is incorporated herein by reference).<br>
With enough beads and efflclent coupling it is possible to generate complete sets of certain oligomers, if desired. The appropriate size of the beads depends on (1) the number of oligomer synthesis sites desired; (2) the number of different compounds to be synthesised (and the number of beads bearing each oligomer that are needed for screening); (3) the effect of the size of the beads on the specific screening strategies e. g. fluorescence-activated cell sorters (FACS) to be used; and (4) the resolution of the encoding/detection methods employed.<br>

Approximately 50 beads were taken in a glass plate and the image of these beads were recorded in three shuffled states and then added to one of the wells in the synthesiser. The beads were taken in 20 wells of the synthesiser accordingly. The resin was washed with DMF and the No-Fmoc-protected Opfp ester of the amino acid (10 mg) was added to each well of the synthesis block. The reaction mixture waa kept at room temperature for 3 h and washed with DMF (6x). The beads were removed from the block, combined together and the Fmoc-protection was removed by 20% piperidine in DMF (3mL, 20 min). The resin was washed with DMF (10x), split in to 20 portions and added to each well of the block after recording its image in three shuffled states. After the incorporation of the second amino acid, the beads were transferred to a syringe. The Fmoc protection was removed by 20% piperidine in DMF (3 mL, 20 min) and the resin was washed with DMF (lOx). The side chain protection of the peptide was removed by treating with 50% TFA in DCM (3 mL, 30 min), and the resin was washed with DCM (lOx), DMF (lOx) and water (lOx)-<br>
Example 6: Selection and structure determination on a fraction of an encoded<br>
library by visual decoding.<br>
Twenty beads were randomly selected from the peptidyl resin and record the im¬ages separately in water. The sequence of the dipeptide on each bead was decoded by visual comparison of final Image of the bead with pre-recorded images of the beads.<br>
Example 7: Confirmation of structure by solid phase Edman sequencing.<br>
Single beads from the dipeptide library were placed on a filter and subjected to Ed-man sequencing on a 477 A Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to provide the dipeptide structure in two standard cycles.<br><br>
Example 8: Capturing 3 orthogonal 2D-projections of a bead<br>
A triangular hole was carved in a 1 cm plate of POM. The hole was symmetrical wtth sides angled at 54.3 " and a length of the side of the lower triangle of 5 mm. The plate was mounted horisontatly and a microscope was mounted at an angle of 35,7 ° underneath so It was perpendicular to the surface of a quartz flowcell mounted in the triangular hole of the POM holder. The corner of the quarlr cell could thus be pro¬jected onto the COD of the microscope from ali three orthogonal sides, simple by carefull rotation of the quartz cell. The beads recorded were fixed on the quartz cell wall simply by adhesion to the walls of the corner and was submerged in the appro¬priate solvent. Three orthogonal pictures were recorded under identical conditions and the coordinates relative to one of the particles were generated.<br>
Example 9: Determining the centre of a particle In a 2-D projection.<br>
The three 2-D pixel-based projections obtained from CCD cameras are treated by the following algorithm. For each alternate pixel in each alternate line of the image it was tested whether a pixel was bright or dark by testing the blue rgb value. Testing was continued from the one before the bright pixel in single pixel steps until at least two dark pixels were detected. Then the center of the range of bright pixels were determined. From this point the height and the center of the bright spot was detemined. The center and the region occupied by the bead was recorded. The search for spots was continued, but ommitting bright pixels within areas already occupied. The centers of bright spots with an area above a small treshold were used as coordinates tor the particles.<br>
Example 10: Confocal determination of spatial positions of particles In a bead<br>
In a stopped flow system individual beads are positioned in a confocal scanning system as in a commercial scanning microscope. The positioning system is based on small IR lasers detecting changes in refractive index or absorption, if the particles are fluorescent, the bead is illuminated with monochromatic light corresponding to excitation wavelength of the fluorescent dye. If it is simple coloured particles the bead is illuminated with white light.<br><br>
The bead is scanned In consecutive 2-D layers as depicted In figure 3. The resolu¬tion {pixel dimension) In the layers as well as the distance between layers is se-fected 10 be smaller than the average particle diameter, Based on the consecutive scans a S-D matrix of particle positions are formed. The dataset is reduced calcu¬lating inter-particle distances or vectors, and the remaining infornnatlon is discarded.<br>
Example 11: Recording of coordinates of particles in a moving bead by two alternating scanning lasers<br>
In a pulsation free constant flow system Individual beads are passed through a scanning system with two orthogonal laser scanning systems as depicted in figure 4. The two 1 -D laser scanners are both orthogonal to the flow direction, and allow a full 3-D scanning of the passing beads, which are moving with constant velocity. In fluo¬rescence mode the lasers will emit light at an excitation wavelength for the fluores¬cent dye in the particles in the beads.<br>
A fast response emission tight detector records the time- resolved emission signal, which in conjunction with the flow speed and the scan parameters are used to con¬struct a full 3-D matrix of particle positions. The dataset is reduced calculating inter-particle distances or vectors, and the remaining information Is discarded.<br>
Example 12: Recording of coordinates of particles in a moving bead by<br>
rotational scan<br>
In a pulsation free constant flow system individual beads is passed a scanning sys¬tem applying a rotational scan focussed on the bead via a parabolic mirror as de¬picted In figure 4.<br>
The two 1-D laser scanners are both orthogonal to the flow direction, and allow a full 3-D scanning of the passing beads, which are moving with constant velocity. In fluo¬rescence mode the laser emits light at an excitation wavelength for the fluorescent dye in the particles in the beads. The circle scan onto the parabolic mln-or is passing alternating 60 degree segments of full and blocked transmission to give three curved scan lines for each rotation.<br><br>
A fast response emission light detector records the time-resolved emission signal, which in conjunction with the flow speed and the scan parameters are used to con¬struct a 3-D matrix of particle positions. The dataset Is reduced calculating inter-particle distances or vectors, and the remaining information is discarded.<br>
Example 13: Determination of distance matrix from particle coordinates.<br>
The coordinates of the particles were determined according to example 8 above. Coordinates were measured in pixel units e.g for picture set b1a-b1c coordinates (0, 0, 0); (22, 110, 84); (-94, 168, 153) were measured, From these coordinates the unique set of distance parameters (140, 245, 146) (length of inter particle vectors) were calculated acconding to the formula presented in Figure 1. The average error on determination of coordinates was approximately 2 % corresponding to the reso¬lution of the method.<br>
Example 14: Robustness of the method for identification.<br>
In order to obtain a quantitative measure of how well individual .beads can be distin¬guished by inserting small fluorescent beads to encode them, a Monte Carlo simula¬tion was performed.<br>
To this end, envisage a spherica! bead as being composed of small cubic volume elements (voxels) of unit vertex length. The actual voxel size corresponds to the accuracy of determining the position of the fluorescent marker within the bead. Then the voxel centers form a grid of potential encoding points within the spherical bead, out of which in the simplest cases m=3 or m=4 are randomly selected. Genericaily, these points of encoding can be regarded as corners of a triangle with n=3 vertices or of a tetrahedron (n=6 vertices). The vertex lengths correspond to the distances between the encoding points. When ordered by magnitude, the set of vertex lengths is invariant under global rotation and translation of the large bead. (Moreover, it is in fact invariant under any action of a symmetry point group in three-dimensional space including inversion at the origin and mirroring at a plane thus discarding po¬tential discrimination by chirality in the case of tetrahedra.)<br>
If the set of vertex lengths is ordered in descending magnitude, i.e.v, Svj... &gt;v„ &gt;0     with     n = 3{6),     then     the     encoding     vector<br><br>
v= {V| .Vj, ...,yj can be identilled with a point in the upper half of the three (or six-) dimensional positive real space J 3 (J B), respectively. Let r £ 0 denote the finite resolution of a CCD camera. Then two beads j and k cannot be discerned if Iheir encoding vectors vj and vk correspond to points less than r apart from one another, i.e. if the separation of encoding nv = t V| - Vk T falls below the camera resolution nv P r.<br>
The corresponding Monte Carlo simulation gives the following results for a bead of 500 units diameter: If the bead is marked with 3 fluorescent points, then 5 in 10'OOO beads give rise to an encoding separation nv P 6 units. If 4 encoding points are used as shown in Fig. 8, then only 2 in lO'OOO beads show separations nv P 12 units, and in none out of 50 million pairs simulated the separation is nv P 3 units. For a bead diameter of 50O0 units the resolution greatly improves: Encoding by 3 points leads to 5 beads in l00000 whose separations of encoding are nv P 60 units. With 4 points one only has 1 in 100000 beads with nv P 120 units separation.<br>
In conclusion, by inserting four encoding particles into a standard bead of 500 μm diameter, within which the canters of the fluorescent particles can be determined with a typical accuracy of 1 μm, provides ample space for encoding many millions of individual beads. The probability that an active hit will not be uniquely identified is very small according to the present simulations.<br>
Example 15. MIcrobead synthesis<br>
In order to optimize the synthesis of the microbeads, 4 experiments were made. In these experiments the stirring speed and the amount of surfactant were changed, see Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
For a typical synthesis, 240 ml Isopar M was transferred to a baffled steel reactor and heated to the polymerization temperature. The Isopar M was purged with argon for 30 minutes. In a round-bottomed flask 6.6 g AcrJeffamine-600 (AcrJEFeoo), 0.825 g sorbitane monolaurate, 22 g distilled water and 0.34 ml dimethyl acrylarnide were mixed and purged with argon for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes 0.283 g of Vazo 44 was added and the polymerization solution was purged with argon for another 5 minutes before it was transferred to the reactor. The polymerization solution was suspended in the Isopar M using a stirring speed of 2000 rpm. After 1 minute 1 ml of N,N,N',N'-tetra methyl ethylene diamine (TMEDA) was added to the polymerizing suspension The polymerization temperature was initially 30°C but it was increased to 50°C in 1 h. The suspension was stirred for another 3 h.<br>
The microbeads were purified by centrifugation using ethanol and dimethyl fonn-amide (DMF) for washing. In a typical purification the suspension from the reactor was transferred to two centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the beads were suspended in ethanol. The sus¬pension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 minutes and the supernatant removed. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant was clear. Afterwards, the micro-beads were washed 3 times with DMF using the procedure just described.<br>
For the use in the encoded beads the micro-beads were labeled  using a llurissen dye. In a typical reaction 1.0 g of microbeads swelled in DMF, 34 mg ATOTA 1 (flu-rissen dye) and 20 ml of DMF were mixed in a 50 ml round-bottomed flask. The flask was fitted with a condenser and a drying tube. The mixfere was reacted for 2 days. The purification of the beads is described in the part describing the purification and fractionation of the microbeads after labelling. Fig. 16 shows pictures of the pu¬rified micnabeads before fractionation.<br><br>
As observed from the pictures in Fig. 16, the microbeads JHT466 and 473 are very small, and cannot be used for encoded beads. The bead size distribution in sample JHT472 is broad and the average size to small. The best result was obtained using the conditions given for JHT471, however, some separation of the beads are still needed.<br>
Example 16. Spatially encoded beads<br>
in order to optimise the preparation of encoded beads, a range of experiments were made. The aim was to improve the distribution and number of microbeads in the encoded beads and to improve the strength of the encoded beads. The conditions for reactions made in tills optimization are given in Table 3.<br>
In a typical encoded beads preparation, a baffled steel reactor was charged with 270 ml of Isopar M and heated to 70'C. The Isopar was purged with argon for 30 min¬utes. 16.9 g AcrJeffamlne-2000 (AcrJEF2k), 0.839 g acrylamide, 0.231 g sorbttain monolaurate, 200 }x\ microbeads in DMF and 50 g distilled water were mixed in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask. The mixture was purged with argon for 30 minutes before 0.695 g of ammonium persuliaie was added. Aftenwards, it was purged with argon for another 5 minutes before it was transferred to the reactor. The polymeriz¬ing mixture was suspended In the Isopar M using a stirring speed of 500 rpm. After 1 minute 3.4 mi of TMEOA was added. The polymerizing suspension was stirred for 5 h, at 70°C. The polymerization temperature of 70°C was constant over night to en¬sure high conversion. Aftenwards, the isopar M was removed by filtration and the product was washed with3*300 ml dichioromethane, 3*300 ml tetrahydrofurane, 3*300 ml methanol and 5*300 ml distilled water. The results from the optimization are given in Table 3. All the polymerizations were made in 270 ml Isopar M, except for JHT475 and JHT483 which were made In 270 ml n-Heptane. Vazo 44 or Am¬monium persulfate were used as radical initiators. A fluorescence image of one en¬coded bead from sample JHT476 Is shown in figure 17. An ortlnogonal pair of fluo¬rescence images obtained with an encoded bead reader according to the present invention fs shown in figure 18.<br>

5.	Computing the set of distance matrices corresponding to the set of 3D-positions thus determined,<br>
6.	Identifying single spatially encoded beads by comparing ttie full set of distance matrices of single spatially encoded beads against the full set of distance matrices of all spatially encoded beads.

7.	Registering the number of not-identified spatially encoded beads,<br>
8.	Repeating the sequence 1 to 7 three times with the following values of the average number of immobilised particles per encoded bead: 5,6, and 7.<br>
9.	Repeating the steps 1 to 8 four times with the following values of the un¬certainty Involved in the determination of ttie spatially immobilised parti¬cle positions: 1,2,4, and 8 micrometers.<br>
The result is presented in the two charts in figure 19 in terms of the number of en¬coded beads with correspondence problem and the number of not-identified spa¬tially encoded beads. It can be seen from the figure that the number of encoded beads with correspondence problem and the number of not identified encoded beads increase with the uncertainty involved In the determination of the spatially immobilised particle positions. It further appears from the figure that the number of encoded beads with correspondence problem Increases with increasing average number of immobilised particles per encoded bead, whereas the number of not identified encoded beads does not vary significantly with the average number of immobilised particles per encoded bead.<br><br>
Example 18: Use of triangles defined by the microbeads for identification of<br>
encoded beads<br>
A batch of encoded beads was prepared according to the method described in Ex¬ample 17 with the set of parameters used for the batch termed JHT476. The beads were sorted according to size by sifting, and 60 beads from the 500 - 700 mi-crometers diameter fraction were dispersed in wafer and fed to an encoded bead reader device comprising a quart flow call with a rectangular cross-section, manual syringes for passing a bead dispersion through the flow cell, a 473nm laser for illu¬minating a central section of the flow cell, two orthogonally aligned cameras equipped with image intensifiers. optical objectives, and band pass fluorescence filters, an image framegrabber for transferring the images from the cameras to a computer, a harddrive for storing the images, an electronic pulse generator for con¬trolling the cameras, the image intensifiars, and the framegrabber.<br>
Each bead was gently passed through the flow cell whereby it was ensured that the bead rolled on the lower horizontal inner wall of the flow cell. The resulting image sequence consist of a series of orthogonal pairs of images of the bead imaged from various angles. For each pair of orthogonal images one distance matrix, D, was de¬rived; <br>
where N is the number of microbeads observed in the bead, and dp, is the distance<br>
between microbead/and microbead k, where/= 1,2	Wand /t= 1,2,.,., N. Thus<br>
d'Ht = Owhen/=ft, anddj*= dkj.<br>
Two pairs of orthogonal images from one such image sequence of an encoded bead are shown in figure 20. In the lower pair of images in the figure the bead is rotated<br><br>
about 15° compared to the upper pair of images. The images to the left were ob¬tained with a camera looking down on the flow cell from above (y.z-projections). The images to the right were obtained with a camera loolcing at the flow cell from the side (x,z-projections). Also shown in the figure is the result of the automatic determi¬nation of the microbead positions marked with"+". Only microbeads thiat are ob-served at the same z-positlon in the y,z- and the x,z-projection are considered for the distance matrix determination. The six different distances between the four mi¬crobeads considered are given in figure 20 for each pair of orthogonal images to the right of each of the two image pairs. Ideally the distances should be identical, how¬ever, deviations in the range 0.2 -1.4 pixels are observed corresponding to a dis¬tance determination reproducibility in the range 0,5 - 3,5 μm.<br>
From the distance matrix of one pair of images all possible triangle defined by the considered microbeads are generated in the computer. Each of the triangles are then stored as a vector, Lj = [ln,lffi,la]. where ifl.lfi, and la are the respective distances between the three microbeads defining triangle /, where /= 1,2,,.,, M, and Mis the number of possible triangles for the given number of microbeads. The full set of tri¬angles of each encoded bead are then stored for use in the later identification pro¬cedure. This is done for all encoded beads, and from the resulting sets of triangles a look-up table is generated. With the use of this look-up table any one of the encoded beads can be identified at a later stage on the basis of its unique set of triangles as defined by its microbead geometry.<br><br><br>
