				<td>The present invention is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent application<br>
U.S.S.N. 10/023,629 titled PRODUCTION OF TRANSPARENT<br>
POLYESTER USING WASTE filed December 17, 2001 by the same<br>
inventors and assignee.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1) Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for making polyester<br>
containing transparent polyester waste suitable for food grade<br>
applications by a novel equilibrium depolymerization process ("EDP"). In<br>
particular, the present invention relates to EDP in which transparent<br>
waste polyester is depolymerized in an esterifier and repolymerized with<br>
virgin polyester. In the equilibrium depolymerizatioii process transparent<br>
waste polyester is extruded into a reactor containing a prepolyester<br>
oligomer mixture having a degree of polymerization (DP) of at least about<br>
1.5. The present invention meets or exceeds the Food and Drug<br>
Administration (FDA) requirements for food contact with polyester and<br>
thus is useful in food contact applications, for example, beverage<br>
containers, and polyester film wrap.<br>
2) Prior Art<br>
Typically, waste polyester has uses in areas where color is not a<br>
concern, for example, as textile insulation, furniture padding, fiber fill,<br>
carpet fibers, etc., which enable the user to recycle any color or mixture<br>
of colors of waste polyester, and optionally apply pigments or dyes to<br>
mask any undesirable color. In this production process, the waste<br>
polyester is merely heated and re-extruded, as molten polyester,<br>
optionally using a vented extruder to remove moisture, and filtered to<br>
remove bits of<br>
metal, paper, etc. The optional pigment or dye may then be added prior to re-extruding<br>
as fiber for example. Applications where color is not a concern generally use 100%<br>
waste polyester.<br>
It is also known to use waste post consumer product polyester in packaging<br>
applications, such as for beverages. These processes use methanolysis, hydrolysis, or<br>
glycolysis reactions to depolymerize the waste polyester to the monomer and then<br>
optionally filter and/or purify the monomer. The monomer may be then used as<br>
feedstock for polymerization with virgin raw materials, for example. These processes all<br>
require additional steps or materials that lead to an increase in cost. For example, if the<br>
waste is not purified then it has unacceptable color (except in limited applications,<br>
because the industry demands clear polyester so that the food is clearly visible). The<br>
unacceptable color may be overcome by the addition of color balancing additives.<br>
In a methanolysis polyethylene terephthalate (PET) process, waste PET is reacted<br>
with methanol to produce the raw materials dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) and ethylene<br>
glycol (EG). These reaction products may be readily purified and thereafter used to<br>
produce virgin polyester (polyester formed from its raw materials). However, most<br>
commercial PET production facilities use terephthalic acid (TA) rather than DMT and<br>
therefore additional processing is required to convert the DMT to TA. The cost of<br>
methanol, the purification of DMT and EG, and the conversion of DMT to TA add cost<br>
to the process.<br>
Hydrolysis of PET is reacting waste PET with water to depolymerize into TA<br>
and EG. However, it is known that certain types of contaminants generally present in<br>
waste PET are very difficult and expensive to remove from TA. This adds cost to the<br>
process.<br>
Glycolysis of PET is reacting waste PET with glycol (such as EG) to produce the<br>
monomer bis-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET) and other oligomers. This process has<br>
significant advantages over methanolysis or hydrolysis primarily because the BHET may<br>
be used as a raw material in either a DMT or TA polyester production process without<br>
significant major modification of the production facility. However, the BHET must be<br>
purified to produce clear, transparent polyester. The cost of glycol and the purification<br>
of BHET add to the total cost.<br>
US Patent 2,933,476 to Fisher describes a continuous process for making PET by<br>
an ester-interchange reaction followed by a polycondensation reaction. In the ester-<br>
interchange reactor the raw materials DMT and EG are reacted catalytically to produce<br>
BHET and other low molecular weight oligomers. Upon completion of the ester-<br>
interchange reaction, from 10 to 30 percent of PET flake waste is mixed in a mixer with<br>
the BHET and other low oligomers. Then the entire molten mass is filtered before being<br>
pumped to a prepolymerizer, followed by a final polymerizer for the polycondensation<br>
reaction. The resultant polymer is filtered and pumped to an extruder to produce film or<br>
fiber. The problem the Fisher patent solves is using waste PET as a variable feed to the<br>
continuous polymerization process to maintain a constant inventory in the polymerizers<br>
independent of the output demand. This process adds no additional methanol, water or<br>
glycol, but does require additional reaction time (the residence time of the mixer), and<br>
uses non-transparent waste.<br>
Japanese Patent 10-310,637 to Masao and Toshio discloses a terephthalic<br>
acid/ethylene glycol polyester production process that includes feeding molten waste<br>
into the esterifier along with the raw materials - terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.<br>
In order to maintain the color, the antimony content of the waste must be less than 10<br>
parts per million and the phosphorus less than 20 parts per million with germanium<br>
being the preferred catalyst. The depolymerization of the molten waste takes 1 hour, and<br>
the molten waste is added to the esterifier with the raw materials.<br>
Indian Patent 158,902 dated February 11, 1987 discloses a batch polymerization<br>
in making polyester using dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol. The waste is<br>
contacted with a prepolymer having a DP of 2 to 60. The waste is added in solid form.<br>
There is a need in the art to provide an efficient and economical continuous<br>
process that does not require additional methanol, water, or glycol, requires no color<br>
balancing additives, requires no additional process steps, and requires no additional<br>
reaction time necessary to make polyester containing waste polyester.<br>
There is a need in the art to produce transparent polyester having waste polyester<br>
therein that is applicable for food grade applications.<br>
There is a need in the art to make clear polyester having up to 50 weight %<br>
recycled waste polyester that is useful for food grade applications and particularly clear<br>
bottles for the beverage industry, wherein the production process creates no color.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns a process for making polyester containing up to<br>
50 percent by weight transparent recycled waste polyester. Moreover, the present<br>
invention relates to a continuous process having an esterifier and two or more<br>
polymerizers. The equilibrium depolymerization process of the present invention does<br>
not require additional reaction time beyond that normally needed to produce virgin<br>
polyester. The depolymerization of the waste is controlled by introducing the waste into<br>
the esterifier in molten form, at any time after the contents of the esterifier have a DP of<br>
greater than about 1.5.<br>
In the broadest sense, the present invention relates to a continuous process for<br>
making polyester containing transparent waste polyester comprising the steps of: 1)<br>
continuously providing a stream containing oligomers having a DP of at least about 1.5;<br>
2) continuously feeding transparent polyester waste to an extruder; 3) continuously<br>
melting in said extruder said waste polyester; 4) continuously extruding said molten<br>
polyester into said stream containing oligomers; 5) continuously completing the<br>
esterification creating a prepolymer mixture; and 6) continuously polymerizing said<br>
prepolymer mixture thereby producing polyester containing waste transparent polyester<br>
suitable for food grade applications.<br>
The polyester containing waste polymer is transparent and can be solid stated<br>
into a product suitable for injection molding into a bottle preform as is known in the art.<br>
The bottle preform can be stretch form blow molded into a plastic bottle useful as a<br>
container for soft drinks or water, as is known in the art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Polyesters of the present invention are manufactured by a continuous process. A<br>
continuous process includes an esterifier and at least two polymerizers. The raw<br>
materials and any necessary catalysts are fed to the esterifier at a pressure of 0 - 5 bar<br>
and a temperature of between approximately 240 to 280 "C, with the continual removal<br>
of methanol or water depending on the starting raw materials. The reaction time in the<br>
esterifier is approximately from about 30 minutes to about 75 minutes, when a DP of at<br>
least about 1.5 is achieved. The molten waste polymer is now added to the esterifier and<br>
the reaction can be continued for about 75 minutes to about 90 minutes. This process<br>
does not increase the esterification reaction time over that of a conventional process<br>
having no waste addition. The reactants from the esterifier are continuously transferred<br>
to the first polymerizer (low polymerizer). The low polymerizer has a slight vacuum,<br>
preferably less than about 200 mm mercury absolute, and operates between<br>
approximately 240 to 300'C for approximately 30 to 75 minutes. Then the reactants are<br>
continuously transferred to one or more high polymerizers where the vacuum is<br>
increased to less than about 10 millimeter mercury absolute, preferably less than about 5<br>
mm, and the temperature is approximately 260 to 300"C for approximately 45 minutes to<br>
90 minutes.<br>
Glycol is continuously removed from the single polymerization, or from the low<br>
and high polymerizers. Polycondensation catalysts such as antimony or titanium<br>
compounds are typically added with the raw materials or at the beginning stages of<br>
polymerization. The output (oligomer mixture) at the end of the esterifier is primarily<br>
BHET (and perhaps some monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) and other oligomers<br>
(such as dimers and trimers of BHET), and the degree of polymerization (DP) is at least<br>
about 1.5 and preferably 5 to 10.<br>
Suitable polyesters are produced from the reaction of the diacid or diester<br>
component comprising at least 65 mole % terephthalic acid or C1 - C4<br>
dialkylterephthalate, preferably at least 70 mole %, more preferably at least 75 mole %,<br>
even more preferably, at least 95 mole %; and a diol component comprising at least 65<br>
mole % ethylene glycol, preferably at least 70 mole %, more preferably at least 75 mole<br>
%, even more preferably at least 95 mole %. It is also preferable that the diacid<br>
component is employed rather than the diester. The preferred components are TA, if a<br>
diacid is employed; DMT if a diester is employed; and EG for the diol component. The<br>
mole percent for all the diacid component totals 100 mole %, and the mole percentage<br>
for all the diol component totals 100 mole %.<br>
Where the polyester components are modified by one or more diol components<br>
other than ethylene glycol, suitable diol components of the described polyesters may be<br>
selected from 1, 4-cyclohexanedimenthanol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-<br>
butanediol, 2,2-dimenthyl-1, 3-propanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-<br>
cyclohexanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,3-cyclohexanedimethanol, and diols<br>
containing one or more oxygen atoms in the chain, e.g., diethylene glycol, triethylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripropylene glycol or mixtures of these, and the like, In<br>
general, these diols contain 2 to 18, preferable 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Cycloaliphatic diols<br>
can be employed in their cis or transconfiguration or as mixtures of both forms.<br>
Preferred modifying diol components are 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol or diethylene<br>
glycol, or a mixture of these.<br>
Where the polyester components are modified by one or more acid components<br>
other than terephthalic acid, the suitable acid components (aliphatic, alicyclic, or<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acids) of the linear polyester may be selected, for example, from<br>
isophthalic acid, 1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid,<br>
succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, 1,12-dodecanedioic acid, 2,6-<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, bibenzoic acid, or mixtures of these and the like. In the<br>
polymer preparation, it is often preferable to use a functional acid derivative thereof such<br>
as the dicthyl, or dipropyl estor of the dicarboxylic acid. The anhydrides or acid halides<br>
of these acids as modifiers generally retard the crystallization rate compared to<br>
terephthalic acid. Accordingly, their use in making polyester is also well known in the<br>
art.<br>
Also contemplated by the present invention is modified polyester made by<br>
reacting at least 65 mole % terephthalate from either terephthalic acid or dimethyl<br>
terephthalate with any of the above comonomers. Particularly contemplated is reacting<br>
about 97 - 98 mole % TA, 2-3 mole % isophthalic acid, and 100 mole % EG. The mole<br>
% of all diacids is 100 mole %, and the mole % of all diols is 100 mole %.<br>
Conventional production of PET is well known in the art and comprises reacting<br>
TA with EG at a temperature of approximately 240 to 280 oC forming BHET, perhaps<br>
some MHET, and oligomers of these, and water. Because the reaction is reversible,<br>
water is continuously removed, driving the reaction to the production of BHET and low<br>
molecular weight oligomers. During the reaction of the terephthalic acid and ethylene<br>
glycol it is not necessary to have catalyst present. Next, the esterified mixture undergoes<br>
a polycondensation reaction to form the polymer. During the polycondensation reaction,<br>
a catalyst is preferred such as antimony (Sb) or titanium. Reacting diesters of<br>
dicarboxylic acids, such as DMT with EG is the other conventional process of making<br>
PET. In this process, catalyst such as zinc, cobalt, manganese and/or magnesium are<br>
used, and the temperature is in the range of about 240-280 oC forming methanol, BHET<br>
and other oligomers. Because the reaction is reversible, methanol is continuously<br>
removed, driving the reaction to the production of BHET. Thereafter, the reaction<br>
products undergo polycondensation. The manner of producing the polyester of the<br>
present invention by a conventional manner is acceptable for the present invention.<br>
In making bottle performs and plastic bottles from the preforms, it is often<br>
desired to produce the cleanest, most transparent, polymer. Accordingly, the fewer<br>
additives employed, the more clear and transparent the polymer produced. On the other<br>
hand, it is sometimes desirable to make a colored transparent plastic bottle or bottles<br>
with other desired characteristics, and thus the use of a variety of conventionally known<br>
additives is also within the scope of the present invention. Accordingly, various<br>
pigments, dyes, branching agents, crystallization retarding agents, reheat agents and<br>
other typical agents may be added to the polymer generally during or near the end of the<br>
polycondensation reaction. The exact desired additives and the place on introduction in<br>
the reaction do not form a part of this invention and this technology is well known in the<br>
art. Any conventional system maybe employed and those skilled in the art can pick and<br>
choose among the various systems of introduction of additives to achieve the desired<br>
result.<br>
Conventionally polyester, which is produced for bottles, is solid state<br>
polymerized to a higher IV. This process also reduces the residual acetaldehyde level in<br>
the resin. Solid state polymerization can be conducted in batch or continuous units.<br>
Solid state polymerization of bottle resin is well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The present invention takes transparent waste, preferable washed polyester<br>
obtained from the recycling of polyester bottles, introduces it into an extruder, heats the<br>
transparent waste polyester in the extruder until it is molten, and extrudes the molten<br>
transparent polyester into a stream containing an oligomer mixture. In a continuous<br>
process, the oligomer mixture stream is present during the later stage of operation of the<br>
esterifier. Optionally, a filter can be employed to filter any polymer gels, bits of paper<br>
or other non-polyester components that are present after the extrusion but before<br>
introduction into the oligomer mixture stream.<br>
The present invention employs an extruder rather than a rotary valve to introduce<br>
the molten waste polyester into the oligomer mixture, because it prevents glycol vapor<br>
leakage and has sufficient pressure for the optional filtration. Molten waste polyester is<br>
employed because using flake or other solid form waste increase the residence time of<br>
the overall process - the residence time increases to permit the solid form to become<br>
molten. The melt temperature of the waste polyester is generally from about 265 to<br>
285*C depending upon the polyester or copolyester being produced. It is preferred that<br>
the hopper containing the waste be purged with nitrogen to prevent oxygen ingress into<br>
the process. It is known that polyester has a moisture regain of about 1 weight %.<br>
Normally polyester polymer is dried prior to feeding into the extruder to prevent loss of<br>
molecular weight. By employing an extruder with the EDP of the present invention, the<br>
slight excess of moisture advantageously initiates partial depolymerization. The partially<br>
depolymerized molten scrap polyester can be extruded at lower temperatures and is<br>
easier to filter because it has a lower molecular weight. Drying prior to feeding may be<br>
required for certain extruder designs to maintain a uniform feed of molten waste.<br>
Optionally, a small amount of glycol (about 1 - 4 %) can be added to the molten waste<br>
polyester to achieve additional depolymerization, and reduce the extruder temperature.<br>
The partially depolymerized molten waste polyester has a low viscosity that aids its<br>
mixing with the oligomer mixture. Thus it is more economical because no additional<br>
components are necessary, it is not necessary to dry the waste, and there is no increase in<br>
residence time in the reactors. Less residence time is more economical, and there is less<br>
degradation of the resulting polymer.<br>
A vented extruder has advantageous features for the present invention such as<br>
helping remove any solvents and volatiles in the molten waste, but it is not necessary.<br>
Thus the present invention can employ either vented or non-vented extruders. The<br>
extruder of the present invention can be any commercially available extruder.<br>
Optionally, a vacuum is applied to the vent to aid in removing volatile organic materials<br>
and any water from the molten waste. A filter or screen changer is also optional such<br>
that the molten waste passes through a continuous screen changer to remove any solid<br>
material such as paper, metal or other contaminants typically found in post-consumer<br>
PET flake. Any remaining volatile components will be removed during the high<br>
temperature, high vacuum polymerization process.<br>
Currently the FDA and equivalent European organizations do not specify the<br>
degree of depolymerization required to be a tertiary recycling process. By extruding the<br>
waste polyester into a stream containing oligomer mixtures in the later stages of the<br>
esterifier, the reactions at these stages of the process control the degree of<br>
depolymerization. This may be particularly useful should the FDA or similar European<br>
regulations require that for food grade applications, the waste PET must be<br>
depolymerized below a specific molecular weight of, say, about 1000 daltons (a degree<br>
of polymerization (DP) of about 5). Therefore it is not necessary to depolymerize the<br>
waste polyester back to iis raw materials. The present inventors recognized that the<br>
molten waste polyester introduced into a stream containing an oligomer mixture during<br>
esterification is always later subjected to the high vacuum and high temperature of the<br>
polymerizer. These conditions remove any solvents or volatiles that may not have been<br>
removed earlier in the process of the present invention, by the process conditions of<br>
extrusion, especially when it is vented/vacuum applied, and/or by filtering, for example,<br>
such that the output from the process of the present invention is suitable for food grade<br>
applications, as will be demonstrated later.<br>
A feature of polycondensation polymers is that the molecular weight distribution<br>
will be the "most probable size distribution" (P.J. Flory Principles of Polymer<br>
Chemistry, Cornell University Press 1953). This is due to an interchange reaction<br>
between, for instance, a terminal hydroxyl group of one molecule and an interunit ester<br>
group of another. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the molten waste<br>
rapidly depolymerizes through this interchange reaction to form the most probable size<br>
distribution. The presence of free glycol in the oligomer mixture will also aid in<br>
depolymerization of the molten waste. There is no evidence of the higher molecular<br>
weight species initially in the waste (Figure 1). Figures 2 and 3 illustrate that no<br>
additional reaction time is required in the secondary esterifier for this equilibrium<br>
depolymerization process to occur. A minimum secondary esterification time of 20<br>
minutes has been estimated for the present invention.<br>
The amount of waste transparent polyester waste may range up to about 50<br>
percent weight of the polyester. Preferably the post consumer waste is washed, and has<br>
an impurities (labels, bottle caps, etc.) removed by floatation or by any similar process<br>
conventional in the art.<br>
TEST METHODS<br>
Intrinsic viscosity (IV) is determined by heating 0.2 grams of the polymer<br>
composition in 20 milliliters of dichloroacetic acid until dissolved. The relative viscosity<br>
(RV) is measured at 25*C using an Ubbelhode viscometer. RV is converted to IV using<br>
the equation: IV = [(RV -1) x 0.691] + 0.063.<br>
The elemental metal content of the ground polymer samples was measured with<br>
an Atom Scan 16 ICP Emission Spectrograph. The sample was dissolved by heating in<br>
ethanolamine, and on cooling, distilled water was added. The solution was centrifuged,<br>
and the supernatant liquid analyzed.<br>
The color of the polymer chips was determined by ASTM D 6290-98 using a<br>
Minolta Chroma-Meter CR-310 spectrophotometer, and reported as CIE L*, a* and b*.<br>
The haze of the preforms was also measured using this instrument.<br>
The molecular weight distribution was measured with a Waters Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatograph. The solvent was trichloromethane/hexafluoro-2-propanol (97/3 v/v),<br>
and the column was calibrated with polystyrene standards.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A continuous polymerization unit having a nominal throughput of 35 Kg/hr was<br>
used for all the trials. In order to simulate in a single esterifier the addition of waste<br>
polyester into an oligomer stream, having a DP of at least 1.5, the esterifier was<br>
separated into 2 stages, followed by low and high polymerizers.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The unit was operated using an EG/TA ratio of 1.15. The recipe contained 2.3<br>
wt % isophthalic acid (IPA) and utilized 220 ppm Sb as catalyst, and 35 ppm of Cobalt<br>
(Co) (cobalt acetate) and 35 ppm Phosphorus (P) (polyphosphoric acid). The waste<br>
flake was obtained from Nationwide (Polkton, North Carolina, USA) and contained 230<br>
ppm Sb and 1.5 wt % IPA.<br>
Five runs were conducted. Run 1 was the control having no waste polyester<br>
added, Run 2 contained 10% waste polyester, Runs 3, 4, and 5 contained 20% waste<br>
polyester. The waste was extruded through an electrically heated extruder, with no<br>
nitrogen purge in the hopper, and filtered using a 20-30-mesh filter. The molten waste<br>
was introduced into the inlet of the second stage of the esterifier, where the oligomer DP<br>
was 2.5. Additional Co was added to runs 4 and 5. The residence time in the second<br>
stage was 75 min. and the temperature was 270° C, resulting in a prepolymer DP of 5.5.<br>
This prepolymer was polymerized. The results are set forth in Table 1.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the material exiting the first stage,<br>
second stage and the waste are shown in Figure 1 for Run 1. Figures 2 and 3 show the<br>
MWD of the prepolymer exiting the second stage for Runs 2 and 3. Figures 2 and 3<br>
show that the waste has been depolymerized and had no effect on the MWD of the<br>
prepolymer, i.e. the equilibrium MWD was maintained.<br>
Additionally the resins from all runs were solid state polymerized to a target IV<br>
of 0.835. The resins were injection molded into a 27.2 gram preforms at 520° F. The<br>
preforms were heated to about 100 -120° C and blow molded into 20 ounce contour<br>
bottles at a stretch ratio of about 12.5. All bottles had good color and minimal IV loss,<br>
well within acceptable ranges of commercially available resins. Acetaldehyde testing<br>
was performed on these bottles and no significant difference in results was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example used the same process conditions as Example 1, with a target IV of<br>
0.635. The waste material was supplied by UltrePET LLC (Albany, New York, USA)<br>
both in pellet and flake form. This material contained 2.3 wt. % IPA and 230 ppm Sb.<br>
For the controls, virgin PET (KoSa T86) was used as a waste feedstock. All runs<br>
contained 35 ppm Co, except run 11 in which it was 50 ppm. The results are set forth in<br>
Table 2.<br>
These runs illustrate that the depolymerization process does not add color to the<br>
final product, and the form of the waste material does not impact the color of the<br>
polymer.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In this example the oligomer mixture was prepared using EG/DMT at a mole<br>
ratio of 3.7 using manganese acetate (75 ppm Mn) as the ester interchange catalyst. The<br>
Sb level was 358 ppm and 2.5 wt. % IP A added, and the target polymer IV was 0.635.<br>
Two types of waste pellets from CeDo Recycling (Beek, The Netherlands) were used, a<br>
clear and a blue (which contained up to 50% of blue/green bottle waste). Additional Co<br>
was added to runs 14 - 16 to control the final polymer color. The oligomer DP at the<br>
waste injection point was 2.5. The results are set forth in Table 3.<br>
Additionally the resins from all runs were solid state polymerized to a target IV<br>
of 0.835. The resins were injection molded into a 27.2 gram preforms at 520° F. The<br>
preforms were heated to about 100 -120° C and blow molded into 20 ounce contour<br>
bottles at a stretch ratio of about 12.5. There was no significant difference in the bottle<br>
physical properties, or acetaldehyde level, between the runs. The color data for the<br>
preforms are set forth in Table 4.<br>
Even run 15, in which 20% of a blue/green waste was used, met the industry<br>
standard for preform yellowness, b*, of less than 6, and haze of less than 15%. The<br>
bottles were visually acceptable with respect to color and transparency.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
In order to demonstrate that this process will produce a resin suitable for food<br>
contact, the FDA guidelines were used. The FDA recommends (Points to Consider for<br>
the Use of recycled Plastics in Food Packaging: Chemistry Considerations) that<br>
benzophenone be used as a nonvolatile polar contaminant and toluene as a volatile non-<br>
polar contaminant.<br>
Using a batch DMT process, ground polyester bottles were added, together with<br>
1000 ppm benzophenone and 1000 ppm toluene based on the amount of recycle waste,<br>
after the ester interchange reaction, prior to polycondensation. The recycled polyester<br>
was added at a 10% and 35% level. The resultant polyester was analyzed for<br>
benzophenone and toluene. At both the 10% and 35% recycle content these<br>
contaminants were found to be below the level of detection, 0.1 ppm. This is well below<br>
the 0.215 ppm impurity threshold level established (FDA) for the use of post consumer<br>
waste in food packaging applications. Using this procedure for a continuous process<br>
should yield similar results.<br>
Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with invention, a<br>
process that fully satisfies the objects, aims, and advantages set forth above. While the<br>
invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is<br>
evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those<br>
