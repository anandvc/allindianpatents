				<td>The present invention relates to an improved hot-rolling process for continuous rolling of sheet bar of large unit weight and apparatus therefore.<br>
The present invention relates to a large unit weight hot-rolling process capable of continuously rolling at a large unit weight (i.e., at the unit of one charge of a steel strip) of 50 to several hundreds tons, and a rolling apparatus for the process.<br>
In the prior art, the hot strip is generally made by heating a slab, as prepared by the continuously casting method or the ingot making-bloom rolling method, again in a heating furnace and subsequently by coarsely hot-rolling and finish-rolling the heated slab. However, this process requires the slab re-heating step so that it is disadvantageous in the high fuel unit. Moreover, a standby is made indispensable in any portions of the slab yard or the heating furnace so that a large unit weight long slab has problems in its handling or maintenance. Still moreover, the rolling is<br><br>
difficult for the large unit weight so that it is performed for the slab at the unit of about 10 to 30 tons.<br>
In this rolling, however, each coil has unsteady portions at its leading and trailing end portions to leave problems of the product quality and production yield unsolved.<br>
In order to solve these problems, there has been proposed a completely continuous rolling process for performing the casting and hot-rolling steps completely continuously.<br>
This completely continuous rolling process is thought to have the following advantages.<br>
(1)	The rolling and forming are performed directly from the<br>
continuous casting machine while requiring no re-heating so<br>
that the fuel unit is improved.<br>
(2) In the non-continuous rolling, each rolling material has<br>
to be smoothly bitten between the upper and lower rolls of the<br>
coarse-rolling mill group and the finish-rolling mill group<br>
so that each rolling material has to be adjusted in its leading<br>
end shape and its thickness. In the completely continuous<br>
rolling, however, the adjustment is not required in the least.<br>
(3) In the non-continuous rolling, the temperatures of the<br>
leading and trailing ends of each rolling material become lower<br>
to invite a disadvantage that the formed products are<br>
heterogeneous in qualities. However, the completely<br>
continuous casting is free from this disadvantage.<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
(4) In the non-continuous rolling, there arise between the<br>
preceding rolling material and the succeeding rolling material<br>
the time and mechanical spaces in which the rolling actions<br>
are not made, so that the effective availability of the precious<br>
rolling mill is lowered to degrade the productivity. However,<br>
the completely continuous rolling is free from this disad<br>
vantage.<br>
(5) In the non-continuous rolling, when each rolling material<br>
is bitten at its leading end by the rough rolling group and<br>
the finish-rolling group, shocks occur so that the rolling mill<br>
has to be designed to have a strength standing the shocks. The<br>
completely continuous rolling has little shock so that it is<br>
advantageous in the design of the strength of the rolling mill.<br>
As described above, the completely continuous rolling can advantageously solve the problems of the non-continuous rolling of the prior art. At this stage, however, the casting capacity of each continuous casting machine is far inferior to that of the rolling mill so that the process cannot be large-scaled.<br>
The following points are noted considering the existing process for making the hot strip.<br>
Specifically, the steel is made at every charges (of 50 to 300 tons) by the "batch operation determined by the capacity of the converter or the electric furnace. In view of the order construction of the hot strip, on the other hand, most lots<br>
- 4 -<br><br><br><br>
of equal width and thickness are at the unit of 50 to 100 tons on an average.<br>
If a continuous rolling at the unit of at least one charge is possible, therefore, even the non-continuous rolling can expect effects similar to those of the completely continuous rolling.<br>
As based on the concept thus far described, we have proposed a hot strip rolling process, as disclosed in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 59-92103, which is enabled to have a rolling capacity similar to that of the continuous rolling, although non-continuous, by dividing the rolling step into a former step and a latter step so that a plurality of rolling mills capable of performing a high draft rolling according to the rolling capacity of the downstream rolling mill are arranged at the former step, and by suitably rewinding the sheet bar, as wound in an up-end state at the former step. By developing this hot strip rolling process, the productivity is remarkably improved. In this rolling process, the slab is rolled, after continuously cast, into such a sheet bar by the high draft rolling mill as is wide enough for the later finish rolling. However, this process has a problem that the hot-rolled steel sheet products are frequently defected at their surfaces by scale biting scratchs or roll mark due to the high draft rolling when the sheet bar is made so that the percentage of defective products is high.<br>
 -5 -<br><br>
Another problem is that the work rolls of the high draft rolling mill are seriously worn on their surfaces to make it necessary to replace themselves so that the initial target of the rolling operation matching the rolling capacity of the downstream rolling mill cannot be achieved.<br>
The invention has an object to provide a hot-rolling process which is improved from the aforementioned hot strip rolling process to lower the product cost more and to improve the product quality, and a rolling apparatus for the process.<br>
We have investigated the causes for the scale biting scratchs in the hot-rolled steel sheet products and have found that the scale biting scratchs are seriously influenced by a draft at the previous rolling for manufacturing the sheet bar to be finish-rolled.<br>
When a steel strip, as continuously cast, is to be rolled without any heating, more specifically, it has been found out that the scale bite is caused at such a low draft of 10 to 20 % in the former rolling as is compared with that of the case in which the continuously cast steel strip is rolled after re-heated in the heating furnace. This cause is thought, although not clearly clarified, to come from the fact that when the continuously rolled steel strip is to be rolled, a<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
temperature difference occurs in the thickness direction of the steel strip so that the surface temperature is lower than<br>
the internal temperature.<br>
Therefore, we have made numerous experiments and investigations by noting that the draft is reduced at the former rolling for making the sheet bar to be finish-rolled and that the temperature difference between the surface and the inside of the steel strip is reduced at the time of performing the former rolling.<br>
The intended object has been achieved more than expected, by trying the use of the sheet bar caster in place of the slabbing - high draft rolling process which was previously developed by us.<br>
The invention has been based on the discoveries thus far described.<br>
Specifically, the invention has the following gists.<br>
1. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars, comprising: the step of passing a sheet bar having a thickness of 20 to 50 mm, as continuously cast by a sheet bar caster, as it is through a first sheet bar twister and then winding it in an up-end state into an up-end sheet bar coil; and the step of rewinding said up-end sheet bar coil, finish-rolling it through a second sheet bar twister and winding it into a hot coil, and a rolling apparatus for the process.<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
2. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars,<br>
comprising: the step of passing a sheet bar having a thickness<br>
of 20 to 50 mm, as continuously cast by a sheet bar caster and<br>
then lightly drafted for shape or quality adjustment, through<br>
a first sheet bar twister and then winding it in an up-end state<br>
into an up-end sheet bar coil; and the step of rewinding said<br>
up-end sheet bar coil, finish-rolling it through a second sheet<br>
bar twister and winding it into a hot coil, and a rolling<br>
apparatus for the process.<br>
3. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to the item 2, wherein the light drafting is performed<br>
at a draft of 3 to 10 %.<br>
4. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to the item 1, 2 or 3, wherein a plurality of sheet<br>
bar casters according to the rolling capacity one finish-<br>
rolling array are arranged in parallel and are run sequentially<br>
at the time interval which is determined by a rolling rate<br>
determined according to the production plan of said<br>
finish-rolling equipment line.<br>
5. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to any of the items 1 to 4, wherein said sheet bar<br>
coil has a unit weight of 50 tons or more.<br>
6. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to any of the items 1 to 5, wherein when a hot-rolled steel strip to be finish-rolled has a thickness of 1.6 mm or<br>
- 8 -<br><br><br>
less, said thickness of sheet bar is 40 mm or less.<br>
7. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to any of the items 1 to 6, wherein before the finish<br>
rolling, the portions corresponding to the inner side and the<br>
outer side of said up-end sheet bar coil are heated.<br>
8. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to any of the items 1 to 7, wherein before the finish<br>
rolling, the upper and/or lower sides of said up-end sheet bar<br>
coil are heated.<br>
9. A large unit weight hot-rolling process for sheet bars<br>
according to any of the items 1 to 6, wherein before the finish<br>
rolling, said up-end sheet bar coil is heated or thermally<br>
holded as a whole.<br>
By combining the omission of the high draft rolling and the exploitation of the sheet bar caster organically, according to the invention, the scale biting scratchs of the hot-rolled steel sheet product are effectively prevented although they are problems in the rolling process disclosed in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 59-92103, and the sheet bar is lightly drafted after continuously cast, so as to correct the shape and adjust the quality of the sheet bar.<br>
Here, the sheet bar caster cannot be finish-rolled at certain unit weight (of 100 tons at the maximum) or less because of the restrictions on the conditions of transfers from the<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
caster to the finish-rolling group, although a variety of investigations have been made in the prior art.<br>
In order that the sheet bars, as made by a plurality of sheet bar casters, may be rolled by one rolling mill, more specifically, they have to be held without no temperature drop. For this necessity, it is advantageous in the aspects of suppressing the temperature drop and making the apparatus compact that the sheet bars are wound and held in the coiled state. In the process of the prior art for rolling the sheet bars at a down-end state, however, the coil is deformed in its shape by its own shape as its weight increases, so that it cannot be rewound before rolled. This tendency is prominent when the coil weight exceeds 50 tons, so that the coil cannot be completely rewound when its weight exceeds 100 tons. When a steel strip is to be made by one set of a sheet bar caster and a finish-rolling group, moreover, the capacity is about 150, 000 tons/month at most.<br>
Thus, the sheet bar casting process of the prior art handles the sheet bar caster and the finish-rolling group as one set but has failed to have the concept that a plurality of sheet bar casters are associated with one finish-rolling array. This technical concept has been introduced at first by the invention.<br>

The invention will be specifically described, in the -following With reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
Figs. l(a) and 1 (b) and Fig. 2 schematically show a sheet bar caster and a finish rolling equipment line, as suited for practicing the invention, and Fig. 3 perspectively shows a representative winder together with a sheet bar twister. In these Figures: reference numeral 1A designates a sheet bar caster; numeral 2A pinch rolls; numeral 3A a rolling mill for shape or quality adjustments; numeral 4A a flying shear; numeral 5A a heat holding chamber; numeral 6A a winder; numeral 6A1 a support bed; numeral 6A2 a turntable; numeral 6A3 a mandrel; numeral 6A4 a coil holding plate; numeral 6A5 guide mechanisms; numeral 6A6 guide rolls; numeral 6A7 guide plates; numeral 6A8 cylinders; numeral 7A a first sheet bar twister; numeral 1B a second sheet bar twister; numeral 2B a finish-rolling mill group; numeral 3B a cooling unit 3B; and numeral 4B a flying shear. Here in the invention, either a sheet bar S1 continuously cast by the sheet bar caster 1A or a sheet bar S2 lightly rolled by the rolling mill 3A is wound in an up-end state into an up-end sheet bar coil SC1. At this time, the sheet bar caster should not be especially restricted by can be exemplified by any of the prior art. However, the sheet bars S1 and S2 have to be so thick that they can be subjected a later finish hot-rolling. Considering that the<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
sheet bar is finish-rolled into a thin steel sheet having a thickness of about 0.8 to 10 mm, it is desired the sheet bars S1 and S2 be given a thickness of 20 to 50 mm (preferably 20 to 40 mm) . Here, since the optimum value of the thickness of the sheet bar is different depending upon the desired thickness after the finish rolling, it may be desirable to adjust the thickness of the sheet bar by drafting the sheet bar before the winding action.<br>
When the continuous cast sheet bar is wound as it is into a coil, on the other hand, cracks may be caused in the sheet bar surface with the cast structure by the bending at the winding time thereby to deteriorate the surface quality of the rolled product. In this case, it is preferable that the sheet bar is rolled, before wound, to break the cast structure of its surface.<br>
After the continuous casting, therefore, the sheet bar is rolled, if necessary, before wound. If the draft at this time is excessively high, it is worried that the scale is bitten, as described hereinbefore.<br>
When the rolling is performed at the entrance side of the winder, on the other hand, the velocity of the sheet bar at the entrance of the rolling mill is equalized to that at the exit of the sheet bar caster so that the rolling rate becomes far lower than that of the hot rolling of the prior art. As a result, an excessively high draft may deteriorate the quality<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
due to a damage of the rolls. At a draft exceeding 10 %, the above-specified drawbacks may probably occur. It is, therefore, preferable that the drafting for correcting the shape or adjusting the quality, as described hereinbefore, is at a draft as light as about 3 to 10 %.<br>
When the continuously cast sheet bar is to be drafted, on the other hand, a danger of inducing the scale bite is not high according to the invention. However, the thinner sheet bar at the casting is the more reluctant to establish a temperature difference between the surface and the inside so that it is advantageous for avoiding the scale biting scratchs.<br>
At the aforementioned previous step, in order to wind the sheet bar S2 (including the sheet bar S1, as in the following) taking a horizontal position into an up-end state by the winder 6A, there is disposed at the entrance side of the winder 6A the first sheet bar twister 7A which is composed a number of rollers and guides for correcting the sheet bar S2 from the horizontal position to an upright position. Then, this up-end sheet bar coil SC1 is rewound as in the up-end state so that it is formed into a hot strip S3 by a downstream finish-rolling equipment line B. However, the sheet bar S2, as rewound in the up-end state from the up-end sheet bar coil SC1, is corrected into the horizontal position by the second sheet bar twister 1B which has a construction absolutely identical to that of the aforementioned first sheet bar twister 7A. After<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
this, the sheet bar S2 thus corrected is rolled to a desired thickness by the finish-rolling mill group 2B and is adjusted in its quality by the cooling unit 3B. Then, the sheet bar S2 is formed into the hot strip S3 and cut at every lengths, as demanded by the flying shear 4B, and is wound and formed into a hot strip coil SC2. Thus, according to the invention, the sheet bar S2 is formed into the up-end sheet bar coil SC1, which is rewound in the up-end state into the hot strip S3. The rolling operation is divided into a former sheet bar making step and a later rolling step because it forms the up-end sheet bar coil SC1.<br>
Here will be compared the capacity of working the upend sheet bar coil SC1 between the sheet bar caster 1A and the shape/quality adjusting rolling mill 3A. The finish-rolling equipment line B at the downstream stage, as including the finish-rolling mill group 2B for shaping the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 into the hot strip S3 and the cooling unit 3B, has a far higher rolling capacity. For an advantage of the actual run, therefore, there is combined with one finish-rolling equipment line B a plurality of sheet bar casters 1A matching the rolling capacity of the array B. These plural sheet bar casters 1A are gradually run with the time lag which is required for the finish-rolling equipment line B to roll and shape one up-end sheet bar coil SC1 into the hot strip S3 so that the downstream finish-rolling equipment line B may be continuously<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
run.<br>
Here, when the plural sheet bar casters 1A and one finish-rolling equipment line B are combined, it is effective for making the rolling works smoother to interpose the heat holding chamber 5A in between.<br>
Here can be conceived a variety of running modes for the combinations of the sheet bar casters 1A and one finish-rolling equipment line B. In an embodiment of Fig. 1 (a) , for one sheet bar caster 1A, there is arranged in one heat holding chamber 5A the winder 6A having one rewinding function, so that the up-end sheet bar coil SC1, as wound on the winder 6A of the other sheet bar caster 1A, is rewound into the finish-rolled state while the sheet bar S2 is being wound on the single winder 6A. In an embodiment of Fig. l{b), on the other hand, there is arranged in the heat holding chamber 5A the winder 6A which has two rewinding functions for one sheet bar caster 1A, so that the up-end sheet bar coil SC1, as wound on one winder 6A, may be in a standby state or a rewound state while the sheet bar S2 is being wound on the other winder 6A. In the embodiment of Fig. 1 (b) , the two sheet bar casters 1A are combined with the single finish-rolling equipment line B, and the two winders 6A are combined with the single sheet bar caster 1A. In other words, there is disposed in the heat holding chamber 5A the four winders 6A which wind and rewind the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 sequentially. In the state of Fig. 1 (b) , the up-end sheet<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
bar coil SC1, as wound on the first winder 6A of the second sheet bar caster 1A, is being rewound, and the second winder 6A corresponding to the second sheet bar caster 1A has wound the sheet bar S2 substantially to its half. On the other hand, the second winder 6A of the first sheet bar caster 1A has formed the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 and is in the standby state, but the first winder 6A is at the beginning of winding the sheet bar S2.<br>
In an embodiment of Fig., 2, one winder 6A is combined with one sheet bar caster 1A. In this embodiment, the sheet bar caster 1A is driven prior to the downstream finish-rolling equipment line B to form two or three up-end sheet bar coils SC1 in advance. In this embodiment, the number of winders 6A, as required, can be reduced, and the rewinding function need not be added. Moreover, no special restriction is made on the action timing between the sheet bar casters 1A and between the sheet bar caster 1A and the finish-rolling equipment line B. On the contrary, there arise disadvantages that the standby time period of the formed up-end sheet bar coil SC1 in the heat holding chamber 5A, that the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 has to be removed from the winder 6A, and that there is required a rewinder 5B especially for rewinding the up-end sheet bar coil SC1. Here will be exemplified a specific combination of the sheet bar caster 1A and the finish-rolling equipment line B. Since the general sheet bar caster 1A has a capacity of about<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
5,000 tons/strand  day, it is practical to combine two sheet bar casters 1A with the finish-rolling equipment line B having a rolling capacity of 10,000 tons/day.<br>
Here, the arrangement and combinations of equipments, as shown in Figs. l(a) and l(b), are suited for a rather low production because of the positional and operational restrictions and because of the casting capacity of the sheet bar caster 1A. On the other hand, the array combination, as shown in Fig. 2, is suited for mass productions because it accepts any number of up-end sheet bar coils SC1.<br>
The invention can take the various modes of embodiment, as described hereinbefore. No matter what embodiment might be taken, however, it is necessary the formed sheet bar S2 into the up-end sheet bar coil SC1.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, here will be described how to wind the sheet bar S2 into the up-end sheet bar coil SC1.<br>
The winder 6A has a body portion constructed by assembling the turntable 6A2 turnably with the support bed 6A1 fixed immovably and by erecting the mandrel 6A3 on the center of the upper face of the turntable 6A2. The winder 6A is further constructed by providing the guide mechanism 6A5 which confronts the side of the mandrel 6A3 to wind the sheet bar S2 accurately and smoothly on the mandrel 6A3. The guide mechanism 6A5 includes: a number of guide rolls 6A6 for pushing the sheet bar S2 onto the mandrel 6A3 introduced so as to wind<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
it on the mandrel 6A3; and a suitable number of guide plates 6A7 for guiding the sheet bar S2 introduced, in a direction to wind it on the mandrel 6A3. The individual guide rolls 6A6 are pushed toward the mandrel 6A3 while holing their predetermined positions by the cylinders 6A8. The pushing forces, as applied to the guide rolls 6A6, are active from the beginning of the winding the sheet bar S2 on the mandrel 6A3. By the pushing forces, neither any clearance is left between the turns of the sheet bar S2 wound on the mandrel 6A3, nor is established any frictional displacement between the surfaces of the wound turns. The guide mechanisms 6A5 thus constructed are required only for winding the sheet bar S2, and their individual guide rolls 6A6 and guide plates 6A7 are retracted to refuge positions when in other than the winding actions.<br>
Since the winder 6A to be used in the embodiments of Figs. l{a) and l(b) has to be given the rewinding function, the turntable 6A2 and the mandrel 6A3 have to be turned idly with respect to the support bed 6A1.<br>
On the contrary, the winder 6A to be used in the embodiment of Fig. 2 need not have the rewinding function but has to be given a function to remove the formed up-end sheet bar coil SC1 from the winder 6A.<br>
As shown, therefore, the turntable 6A2 is overlaid by the removable coil holding plate 6A4 having a flat disc shape, and<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
the mandrel 6A3 can be lowered into the support bed 6A1. As also convenient, after the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 was formed by the winder 6A, the mandrel 6A3 is lowered so that the up-end sheet bar coil SC1 can be removed from the winder 6A while being carried on the coil holding plate 6A4.<br>
Herein the hot finish rolling, the finishing temperature is usually managed so that problems occur in the aspects of material and quality unless the finishing temperature fails to keep within the managed standard. In the invention, the sheet bar of 50 tons or more is rolled at one time, the temperature fluctuation is liable to occur in the sheet bar. Especially the inner side and the outer side of the sheet bar coil are liable to take lower temperatures because they have high thermal diffusions. If the winder is of the type in which the sheet bar is wound on the mandrel, as shown in Fig. 3, the inner side of the coil has a large temperature drop. In order to suppress the temperature fluctuation in the sheet bar, therefore, the winder is preferable of the type having no mandrel. Fig. 4 perspectively shows the essential portion of the winder without the mandrel, and Figs . 5 (a) and 5 (b) present a top plan view and a front elevation of the mandrel-less winder. Now, the winder, as shown in Fig. 4 and Figs. 5(a) and 5 (b) , is enabled to bend the sheet bar S2 at a predetermined curvature with bending rolls 8. The leading end of the sheet bar S2, as bent by the bending rolls 8, is fed to three forming<br>
- 20 -<br><br>
rolls 9, as exemplified, so that the sheet bar S2 is coiled and taken up while being turned on a turn table composed of three table rolls 10. Here, the bending rolls 8 and the forming rolls 9 are freely moved outward as the coil diameter increases, and are enabled to adjust the curvature of the sheet bar coil SC1 in accordance with the increase in the coil diameter by adjusting the gap of the bending rolls 8. Here, the turntable, as shown in Fig. 4 and Figs., 5 (a) and 5 (b) , is composed of the three table rolls 10 which are arranged radially of the center of the turns of the coil. However, the invention should not be limited thereto but may exemplify the turntable by a disc-shaped one. Since this disc-shaped turntable is troubled by a temperature drop at the lower face of the coil, however, there is advantageously employed the construction which is composed of the table rolls 10, as shown in Fig. 4 and Figs. 5(a) and 5(b).<br>
In order to compensate the temperature drop at the inner side and the outer side of the sheet bar coil SC1 and to further reduce the temperature fluctuation in the coil, on the other hand, it is preferable to heat or thermally hold the inner and outer sides. This heating means may be exemplified either by heating the inner and outer sides of the sheet bar coil SC1 with burners 11a and 11b, as shown in Fig. 6, or by interposing an induction heater 12 between the rewinder 1B and the finish-rolling mill 2B, as shown in Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), to<br>
- 21 -<br><br>
heat the leading end portion and the trailing end portion, as corresponding to the inner side and the outer side of the coil, of the rewound coil. In short, it is important to reduce the temperature fluctuation in the sheet bar coil SC1 at the entrance side of the finish-rolling mill, and it is desired to heat or hold the temperature thereby to confine the temperature fluctuation within 50°C by employing the above-specified means.<br>
When the sheet bar coil SC1 is to be held, moreover, it is worried that the temperature drops at the two widthwise end portions of the sheet bar coil SC1, i.e., at the upper and lower sides of the sheet bar coil SC1. It is, therefore, desired to heat the upper side and/or the lower side of the sheet bar coil SC1 likewise with the heating means such as burners 11c and 11d thereby to minimize the temperature fluctuation. Alternatively, the sheet bar coil SC1 may be inserted, after wound, into a heating furnace so that it may be heated as a whole.<br>
As has been described hereinbefore, the invention is intended to improve the quality and yield of products by minimizing the ratio of the unsteady portions, as appearing at every rolling operations at the leading end portion and the trailing end portion. It is the most efficient to roll one charge of a converter or an electric furnace by one run. Considering these points, it is preferable to set the unit<br>
- 22 -<br><br>
weight of the sheet bar coil to at least 50 tons.<br>
Thus, the invention can reduce the ratio of the unsteady portions such as the leading end portion or the trailing end portion so that it is especially effective at the time of hot-rolling the sheet which is so thin, e.g., 1.6 mm or less that the unsteady portions are hard to roll.<br>
When the thin sheet having a thickness of 1.6 mm or less is to be finish-rolled, the thickness of the sheet bar is desired to be 40 mm or less considering the rolling capacity of the finish-rolling mill. However, the sheet bar having a unit weight of 50 tons or more and a thickness of 40 mm or less will be crushed by its own weight if it is wound in the down-end state. Fig. 8 illustrates the results of examinations of the influences of the sheet bar thickness and the unit weight to be exerted upon the coil deformations, when the sheet bar is wound in the down-end state into the coil. As illustrated in Fig. 8, it is found that the coil is crushed in the down-end state when the sheet bar has a thickness of 40 mm or less for the unit weight of 50 tons.<br>
In the invention, however, the sheet bar is formed into the up-end sheet bar coil by winding it in the up-end state so that the up-end sheet bar coil is not crushed or scratchs in the least even if it has a large unit weight. Moreover, the up-end sheet bar coil can have a large unit weight, as described hereinbefore, so that the effects to improve the<br>
- 23 -<br><br><br>
quality of the strip, the yield and the production efficiency can be achieved by rolling the coil of the large unit weight continuously at the downstream finish-rolling equipment line.<br>
Here, the surface and the inside of the sheet bar can be thermally homogenized to have no temperature difference by winding it into a coil, so that no scale biting scratch is formed even by a later finish-rolling like the hot-rolling of the prior<br>
art.<br>
Moreover, the capacity of making the sheet bar using the sheet bar caster and the capacity of forming the formed sheet bar into the hot strip can be combined to run the individual rolling mills and the remaining facilities for forming the various hot strips can be continuously run without any standby, so that the expensive equipments can be effectively utilized.<br>
Example<br>
The large unit weight hot-rolling process according to the invention was executed by using the rolling apparatus shown in Fig. l(a). For comparisons, hot strips were also made by the slabbing - high draft rolling process of the prior art, as disclosed in Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No. 59-92103.<br>
As a result, the process of the invention could execute the completely continuous rolling at the unit of one heat size (200 to 300 tons) having a practical meaning and is superior<br>
- 24 -<br><br>
to the comparison process especially in the following points.<br>
According to the comparison process, more specifically, poor qualities such as the scale biting scratchs or the roll marks were caused by the high draft rolling so that the production yield was up to 90 %. According to the process of the invention, on the contrary, the qualities were not poor, and the production yield as high as 99.9 % could be achieved.<br>
According to the comparison process, moreover, the adjustments were troubled between the continuous slabbing rate and the rolling rate of the high draft rolling mill, and the work rolls of the high draft rolling mill were damaged in the course. Then, the continuous slab had to be cut to run the continuous casting apparatus and the high draft rolling mill asynchronously. This trouble did not occur in the process of the invention.<br>
The resultant effect is that the production yield per month rose to raise the productivity by 20 % more than the prior art.<br>
As to the cost for facilities, moreover, the invention does not need the high draft rolling mill of the prior art so that it could omit the construction cost and the mill maintaining cost thereby to lower the mill cost by about 30 %.<br>
According to the invention, both the quality of the hot strip and the production yield can be simultaneously improved<br>
- 25-<br><br>
better than the slabbing- high draft rolling process of the prior art. Moreover, no trouble occurs during the run due to the high draft rolling so that the production efficiency can be improved. Still moreover, no cost is required for constructing and maintaining the high draft rolling mill so that the mill cost can be lowered.<br>
