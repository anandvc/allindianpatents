				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PROVIDING DYMANIC SELECTION OF COMMUNICATION ACTIONS USING STORED RULE SET<br>
FIELD OF THF INVFNTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to communication systems. In particular, the present invention provides a method and system for dynamically selecting actions and dynamically routing communications to the most appropriate communication device of a user.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THF INVENTION<br>
Customer services, such as voice mail service is well known in standard and cellular telephone systems. With voice mail services, one user can leave an audio message for another user when the other user is not available for some reason (e.g., is currently talking on the telephone or is physically not present to answer the telephone). In one typical scenario, a cellular telephone user makes a cellular telephone call to a telephone subscriber of the public switched telephone network (PSTN). When the PSTN subscriber is currently on the telephone and has purchased the voice mail service option from the local telephone service company, the call is transferred to a voice mail system together with a voice mailbox identification of the PSTN subscriber (typically the PSTN subscriber"s telephone number). Upon receiving the call, the voice mail system retrieves the PSTN subscriber"s audio prompt message from memory and conveys the prompt message to the caller. In response to the prompt message, the caller transmits an audio message that is stored by the voice mail system in a memory location associated with the PSTN subscriber. When the PSTN subscriber is alerted or eventually decides to check his or her voice messages, the PSTN subscriber simply calls the voice mail system and instructs the voice mail system (usually via telephone keypad entries, but alternately using voice commands) to retrieve and play the stored message.<br>
In another typical scenario, a PSTN subscriber makes a telephone call to a cellular telephone user. When the cellular telephone user is currently unable to answer the call and has purchased the voice mail service option from the cellular<br>
telephone service provider, the call and a voice mailbox identification of the cellular subscriber (typically the cellular subscriber"s telephone number) are transferred within the cellular system infrastructure to a voice mail system coupled to the cellular system infrastructure. Upon receiving the call, the voice mail system retrieves the cellular subscriber"s audio prompt message from memory and conveys the prompt message to the caller via the cellular infrastructure. In response to the prompt message, the caller transmits an audio message that is stored by the voice mail system in a memory location associated with the cellular subscriber. To check his or her voice mail messages, the cellular subscriber simply calls the voice mail system and instructs the voice mail system to retrieve and play the stored message. In the above-described ways, voice mail allows cellular and PSTN users to receive messages that they would otherwise not be able to receive. Thus, voice mail is a very powerful communication feature in today"s fast-paced world.<br>
Current voice mail (VM) systems allow limited customization of voice mail messages. For example, some current voice mail systems have the capability to play one message during office hours and a different message after office hours. This illustrates a basic time-based method to determine which of two messages to present to callers.<br>
It would be advantageous to provide an improved system and method by which a caller may find and contact a subscriber and/or relevant communication device to provide improved services.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRFSFNTLY PREFERRFD EMBODIMENTS<br>
A method and system selects and executes an action in a communication node. The communication node is advantageously in communication with at least a schedule database and a rules database. When an incoming communication directed to a subscriber is received, a communication priority is determined. The status of the subscriber is determined by accessing the rules database, the rules database having a rule set for the subscriber. An action is selected based on the rule set for the subscriber using the communication priority and the subscriber status.<br>
The system can include a communication device determining server, element or function that includes the capability to determine which communication device would be most appropriate in regards to contacting the subscriber and may be adapted to contact the subscriber via the most appropriate communication device. For pagers, cellular phones and other sophisticated communication devices, including wireless telematic devices, in addition to providing a number of customizable messages to callers, additional actions can include the option of contacting the subscriber by alternate devices other than the selected single telephone connection. Additionally, a caller may indicate the priority of a call responsive to which the system can determine an action based on a predetermined set of rules.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates generally the communication system 8 of the present invention. The communication system 8 generally includes a communication device 12 used by caller 10, communication networks 14,18 and a communication node 16. The communication system 8 further includes a number of optional communication devices 20, 24, 26 and 28 to be used by subscriber 38.<br>
To access and/or connect with the communication node 16, caller 10 may utilize the conmunication device 12 of the communication system 8. The communication devices 20, 24, 26 and 28 may be used by subscriber 38 to access and/cr connect with communication node 16. The communication devices 12 and 20, 24, 26 and 28 can include, but are not limited to, wire-line telephones, mobile telephones, paging units, radio units, wireless data devices, Web telephones, portable or wireless telephones, personal information managers (PIMs), personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal computers (PCs), network<br>
televisions (TVs), Internet TVs, Internet telephones, portable wireless devices (i.e., two-way pagers), security systems (both mobile and premises-based), workstations, facsimile devices and printers or any other suitable communication devices.<br>
The communication networks 14,18 of the communication system 8 can include, but are not limited to, wire-line, wireless, GSM, TDMA, AMPS based systems, intranets, extranets, the Internet, a Local Area Network (LAN), a telephone network, (e.g., a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), private telephone networks, and so on), a cellular network, satellite networks, a personal communication system, a TV network (e.g., a cable TV system), local, regional, national or global paging networks, an email system, a wireless data network (e.g., satellite data or local wireless data networks), a wireless LAN, a wireless local loop/distribution system (e.g., LMDS, MMDS or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based system), a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) network, or any other suitable network. The communication networks 14,18 can also include a wide area network (WAN), such as, for example, the Internet, the World Wide Web (WWW) or any other similar on-line service. It will be recognized that the communication networks 14, 18 may have portions in common, may comprise two separate networks, or may be the same network.<br>
Communication network 18 may connect to a number of communication devices used by subscriber 38 of the system; the devices are exemplified herein as communication device 20, wireless communication device 24, personal pager device 26 and alternate communication device 28. It should be understood that other communication devices might be included in the system in addition to those shown in the figure.<br>
The communication node 16 of the communication system 8 can include, but is not limited to, an interactive voice response node, a server computer, the MIX™ platform and the Myosphere™ Service provided by Motorola, Inc. of Schaumburg, IL (as further described with reference to FIG. 5), or other suitable system. It will be recognized that the communication node 16 may be integrated within or may be remote from the communication networks 14, 18. Further, the communication node 16 may be integrated in a central system or may be a distributed system.<br>
The communication devices 12, 20, 24, 26 and 28 communicate with communication networks 14,18 via the communication node 16. The communication network 14,18 can interface with the communication devices 12, 20, 24, 26 and 28 through wire-line or wireless networks or systems (i.e., telephone or televisions systems, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) systems, coaxial lines, computer networks, digital end user lines, private networks, wireless local loop systems, etc.).<br>
The communication node 16 may -incorporate, or be associated with or in communication with an electronic calendar or scheduler 30, voice mail system 32, rules engine 34, databases 36 and a location and presence engine 40. The scheduler 30 may be an electronic scheduler application; such as that available in Microsoft® Outlook, or the like, which is accessible to the subscriber 38 and in communication with the communication node 16. Preferably, the subscriber 38 can assign priorities to each event scheduled in the scheduler 30. The voice mail system 32 is any voice mail system that is capable of being accessed by the communication node 16 and capable of recording messages and playing back a number of messages in response to a request from the communication node 16. The communication node 16 can access the rules engine 34. The communication node 16 can use the rules engine 34 to make determinations based on subscriber information stored in databases 36 and other criteria, such as the location of the subscriber and the time of call. The determinations can include call forwarding and voicemail playback. Databases 36 may be a single database or a multiple database system, housed in a single server, or the like, or located in multiple servers and locations. Databases 36 are accessible by the subscriber 38 and may include subscriber information stored as preferences, rules, voice mail preferences and voice mail messages and so on, as will be described more fully hereinafter. The location and presence engine 40 is a system or interface adapted to obtain location and presence information of the subscriber. The engine 40 is adapted to detect presence which is defined as whether the subject is busy, available, not available, offline and online and so on.<br>
As further described below, the communication system 8 can provide various services and capabilities to cellular end users, wire-line telephone end users, paging end users, satellite end users, mobile or portable telephone end<br>
users, trunked end users, computer network end users (e.g., Internet or Intranet end users), wireless data end users, branch office end users and the like. In addition to recording voice messages and routing incoming communications, for example, by way of the voicemail system 32 and a routing and messaging system (not shown), the communication system 8 can provide speech and/or touch-tone recognition, incoming call authorization, call routing, text-to-speech (TTS) and/or speech-to-text (STT) capabilities, content information, messaging services, call screening, interactive voice applications, instant messaging and unified messaging services, and so on.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of an initial routine, generally referred to by reference character 100, for populating the databases 36 and setting the rules in accordance with the present invention. Before the system 8 is fully operational it is preferable to populate databases 36 depending on the options offered by a service provider or subscribed to by the subscriber 38. It will be understood that the order that the various databases are populated is not critical to the invention. Generally, the initial routine includes population of or provisioning of the various databases with information that the system uses to perform various determinations and select and execute various actions. The provisioning of the databases may be done directly by the subscriber, by an assistant or by members of the service provider or by synchronizing with other databases. Revisions or maintenance of the databases may occur in a similar fashion. In all probability, however, the subscriber would most efficiently perform maintenance of the scheduler database.<br>
The databases included in the initial routine include a subscriber information database. With respect to block 110, the subscriber information database includes information such as schedule, location, available time, address book information and information pertaining to determining the location of the user. The subscriber information may include a priority associated with each entry in the schedule. Entries may include meetings, for example. Also, a priority can be assigned to each location or address in the supplied address book information. In this manner, a priority, relative to a subscriber location, is assignable for use by the system in making a determination as to what action should be taken in response to an incoming call.<br>
With respect to block 120, the initial routine includes the entering of information related to each calling party, i.e., caller ID mapping. C= er ID mapping allows the system 8 to identify incoming callers according :D caller ID. The caller ID may originate from caller line identification (CLI), calle" device identification or a manual input of caller identification. The caller identity may be derived from a phone number, an IP address, network identiflcatio- or an e-mail address or a PIN number or the like. Identification by CLI is known - the art. Manual input may include methods such as the caller entering a personal identification number (PIN), with or without a prompt by the system end audibly projecting voice identification" or the like. Other methods to identify ~e caller include voice authentication, identification of IP address and other aevice identification information.<br>
With respect to block 130, the initial routine includes the ente^ng of customization information. In this step, the subscriber 38 can ente- = number of custom voice mail messages, personal voice messages, pager nurrzer and personal voice prompts and other information, such as contact infor~ation to be used by the voice mail system 32. The subscriber also may provide ^formation relating to his or her alternate communication devices such as a pacer number. The subscriber 38 or the service provider, or the like, may also pro\ :e information relating to finding the location or the subscriber presence information. For example, this may include configuring the information needed :: access a location determination and presence engine. In the event that an ir :al call attempt is unsuccessful and the system determines that the subscrizer should be contacted by alternate communication devices (as opposed to recor:ing a message) the information relating to the alternate communication de.ices enables the system 8 to perform a further attempt to contact the subscriber.<br>
With respect to block 140 and block 150, the initial routine inz jdes the entering of subscriber rules (block 140) and subscriber rule actions z.ock 150). The subscriber rules are rules that instruct the system (in one embc: ment, performed by a rules engine) as to how to proceed according to var zJS variables defined in the rules database. The rule actions are the actions whic :he system performs responsive to the determinations made by the rules engine  The variables to be included in the rules database include the caller iderr.zy, caller<br>
priority, the subscriber location, time of call, subscriber status, and the action. An example of a rules table for a rules database is shown below in <br>
Table 1.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
Referring to Table 1, the rules database 36 may include a caller identity, a call priority (that may be a caller priority or a call device priority) a subscriber location, a time of call, a subscriber status (priority) and an action portion. As discussed above, the caller identity may be determined by CLI, caller device identification or an input code by keypad, voice or other known methods.<br>
The call priority may be determined through the caller identity or may be input manually by the caller 10 before or after a prompt from the system 8. The caller 10 may input the priority by keypad, voice or other methods. The subscriber location is determined by the system 8 accessing the electronic scheduler 30 with location information or a location and presence determination system, or the like, of the subscriber. The time of call is derived from the time the call is received by the system.<br>
The subscriber status (priority) may be determined by the system 8 obtaining the status from the subscriber scheduler 30, address book 36, location and presence engine 40, a combination thereof and the like. In the alternate, the status/priority may be changed or overridden by the subscriber 38 when, for example, the subscriber, contrary to the entry in the scheduler, unexpectedly becomes busy or unoccupied. In this manner the subscriber can provide feedback to the process, in that, the subscriber 38 may perform a change of<br>
status in real time by either electing to receive a communication directed to the subscriber 38 by the system 8 or directing the system to direct the call to a voicemail 32 option or any one of several options. The options can include directing the system to execute a second action based on the feedback or a number of sequential actions including call forwarding, first and second call actions, sending a message and so on.<br>
The action fields may include a number of options. For example, a regular and a number of customized voicemails may be specified. The rules table in the database 36 may specify pager and wireless telephone information. The rules may specify a number of other options including automatic page options, forwarding of the call to an administrative assistant, forwarding of the call to an alternate phone device, forwarding of the call to a wireless information device and/or the provision of contact/location information, and forwarding of the call to a personal assistant that may transcribe the message and can dispatch it in a different format such as an instant message. The portion of the system adapted to determine the location of the subscriber is also adapted to verify the location of the subscriber by known methods.<br>
It can be seen in the examples given in Table 1 that a caller 10 with an unknown identity will be presented with a regular voicemail regardless of a priority of the call, the time of call, the subscriber location and so on.   If a caller 10 identity is established, but does not match any of the stored caller identities, the caller can be presented with a regular voicemail and pager information regardless of the given priority, the subscriber location, and the subscriber status if the time of the call is during working hours. If the call arrives outside of the 8am-5pm work hours, for example, the system 8 can be configured to merely present a regular voicemail or other options.<br>
As can be seen in further examples, generally, it may be advantageous to configure the system 8 to provide more action options as the priority of the call becomes relatively high compared to that of the subscriber 38. For example, if a spouse places a call having a low priority, and the subscriber 38 is at an office location with a low priority, the system 8 can present a regular voicemail message with an option to page. If the spouse"s caller priority is a medium priority, the system 8 can present a regular voicemail and automatically pages the subscriber.<br>
If the spouse"s caller priority is high, the system 8 presents a customized voicemail, schedule information, and executes an automatic page to the subscriber 38.<br>
Table 1 illustrates a number of optional scenarios and outcomes dependent upon the particular variables in a call event. Other scenarios are possible dependent upon the complexity of the rules and the possible actions to be taken. Accordingly, it will be understood that the table presented is illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 are presented to illustrate the method of the present invention generally referred to as reference characters 300 and 400, respectively. It should be understood that the order of many of the steps as presented herein could be changed without affecting the functioning of the system 8 or the outcome. As such, the method presented herein should be considered exemplary in nature.<br>
In block 310, the caller identity is determined. The caller identity may identify the person calling by determining the CLI or caller device identity or an alternate method such as voice identification, inputting of a PIN number or the like. In block 320, the call context/priority is determined. Examples of a call priority may include low, medium, normal, high and emergency. The call priority can be determined by the system accessing the rules database where a priority may be associated with each preexisting caller identity. The caller using a keypad, by voice or other manual data input, may set the call priority manually. In one example, a subscriber"s supervisor can be assigned a high priority in the system so that calls from the supervisor are always given a high priority. In an emergency, a spouse may enter a high priority to evoke an action from the system that locates and contacts the subscriber instead of merely playing a voicemail response and offering to record a voice message.<br>
In block 330, the time of call is determined. The time of call can be used by the system when accessing the location database to determine the location of the subscriber. The time of call can be used to check the subscriber schedule, rules pertaining to specific times, days, weekends, night and so on. The time can be used to provide time and time zone based services. In block 340, the subscriber status (priority) is determined. The system uses the schedule,<br>
presence and location information, each with an associated priority to determine the subscriber or subscriber status. The status may include schedule information such as the subscriber being in a meeting - which may have priorities from low to high. If the subscriber is in a customer meeting the priority may be medium or high since typically one might not wish to be disturbed during a meeting with an important client or customer. The schedule might include location information detailing the location of an off-site meeting with associated contact information including an address and off-site phone numbers. The location can include the subscriber being at home or at work, for example.<br>
In block 350, the system determines an initial data set using any of the determined caller ID, call context, call time and subscriber status. The initial data thus determined is compared to the rules via a rules engine and an action or action set is selected. The system can include paging and various message options at this point. The system, as shown in J)lock 360, determines or obtains the subscriber preferences to select the call action. The subscriber preferences may include which of a pager number to use, a message to play, contact information, location information and alternate contact numbers or methods. Also, the system can perform paging and various message options.<br>
In block 370, the action selected in block 360 is executed. The actions include the playing of a regular or customized voicemail message, execution of an automatic page or data communication (by wire phone, wireless phone, e-mail and so on), paging, instant messages, small message system (SMS) options and a presentation of other options. The other options include an option to page and the presentation of contact and/or location information. At block 410, the subscriber is given further options by the system. The subscriber may elect to receive the message via pager or wireless phone, for example, may select to direct the call to voice mail or offer other options. Essentially, in this manner the subscriber may interactively direct the system to one or more option. This interactive aspect of the invention allows the subscriber to direct the system in response to a changing situation.<br>
At block 420, the system determines if the selected action has been successfully implemented. If the selected action has been successfully been implemented and carried out, the process terminates. If the action is<br>
unsuccessful, the system (at B) loops back to block 340, updates the subscriber status and continues sequentially through the steps to completion. For example, based on subscriber feedback, the system determines that the expected action has not been executed successfully and may seek an alternate action (including further refinement of rules based on subscriber feedback).<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, an exemplary block diagram of another embodiment of a communication system 200 having the capability to select and execute an action based on a rules database as set forth in the above description is illustrated. The communication system 200 generally includes one or more communication devices 201, 202, 203, 204, 205 (five being shown), an electronic network 206, and one or more information sources (e.g., content providers 208, 221 (two being shown) and data and voice markup language servers 209, 251, 253, 257).<br>
The user (a caller or a subscriber) can access the electronic network 206 by dialing a single direct access telephone number (e.g., a foreign telephone number, a local telephone number, or a toll-free telephone number or PBX) from the communication device 202. The user can also access the electronic network 206 from the communication device 204 via the Internet 220 or WWW, from the communication device 203 via a paging network 211, or from the communication device 205 via a LAN, a WAN, an e-mail connection or in any other similar manner.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the electronic network 206 includes a telecommunication network 210 and a communication node 212. The telecommunication network 210 is preferably connected to the communication node 212 via a high-speed data link, such as, for example, a T1 telephone line, a LAN, a WAN or a VOIP network. The telecommunication network 210 preferably includes a PSTN 214 and a carrier network 216. The telecommunication network 210 can also include, for example, international or local exchange networks, cable TV networks, inter-exchange carrier or long distance carrier networks, cellular networks (e.g., mobile switching centers), PBXs, satellite systems, wireless data networks and other switching centers such as conventional or<br>
trunked radio systems (not shown), and so on. The electronic network 206 can also include additional telecommunication networks, such as, for example, a wireless data network 207.<br>
The PSTN 214 can include various types of communication equipment, such as for example, ATM networks, Fiber Distributed Data networks (FDDI), T1 lines, cable TV networks, VOIP networks and the like. The carrier network 216 generally includes a telephone switching system or CO 218. It will be recognized that the carrier network 216 can be any suitable system that can route calls to the communication node 212, and the CO 218 can be any suitable wire-line or wireless switching system.<br>
The communication node 212 is preferably configured to receive and process incoming calls from the carrier network 216 and the Internet 220. The communication node 212 can receive and process pages from the paging network 211 and can also receive and process messages (e.g., e-mails) from the LAN, WAN, wireless data or e-mail system 213.<br>
When a user dials into the electronic network 206 from the communication device 202, the carrier network 216 routes the incoming call from the PSTN 214 to the communication node 212 over one or more telephone lines or trunks.
