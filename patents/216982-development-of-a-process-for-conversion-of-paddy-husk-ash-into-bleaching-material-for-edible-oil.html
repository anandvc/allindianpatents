				<td>Development of an edible oil bleaching manerial by using paddy ash - A new process in which rice husk fly ash can be converted into a bleaching material which can remove the colour, during refining of crude edible oil. The rice husk can be burnt to prepare ash in furnaces which can be used for preparation of bleaching material. The material is much cheaper than the commercially available bleaching earths and hence could he an import substitution. The cost of refining can be substantially reduced by using this rice husk fly ash. This husk is abundanti available m the country and sis disposal is a problem. This invention is eco-friendly and based on waste utilization (Ref NIL).</td>

				<td>Introduction: The traditional understanding of bleaching is, as the name implies. decolonization of the oil. This is done by mixing the heated oil under vacuum with especially prepared earth that adsorb the colour bodies and then filtering the spent earth from the oil. Bleaching is one of the important steps in refining of edible oils. Purpose of bleaching is to remove colouring compounds, xanthophyll, chlorophyll etc. present in the oil. Bleaching earths are generally used to remove the colour pigments present in oil. Bleaching also reduces the level of phosphatides and oxidizing bodies. The oil is heated and mixed with 1-2 percent of its weight of an effective bleaching earth. After a contact time of approximately half hour, the bleaching earth is separated by filtration. In some dark colour oils activated carbon is also used with bleaching earth as an adsorbent for colour removal.<br>
Problem: Presently the bleaching of the edible oil is done with a clay, which is a volcanic ash and is found at certain specific geographical areas inside the earth. In the natural form this clay is inactive but with acid treatment it can be activated. Actvated bleaching earth is montmorillonite clay having two silica telrahedial layers and an aluminum octahedral layer. It is a porous colloidal aluminum silicate insoluble in acids, light coloured powder, which can absorb 2 to 4 times of its weight and its oil retention is around 5%. Silica and alumina are the main components whose structure is responsible for colour removal of edible oil. The particle size, moisture content, bleacnability, liltration rate and oil retention is the major criteria for its selection. The bleaching process has not changed substantially over the years. Lately, more efficient or low cos; local earths have become available, but bleaching is still expensive. The standard bleaching earth available in market is costly and is imported. These earths also absorb some oil with them and that oil comes out with bleaching earth during filtration. So, the absorbed oil goes as waste. The purpose of this study was to invent alternate bleaching material for edible oil refining.<br>
Advantages: Rice husk is waste coming from rice mills in large quantity and generally tised as fuel. Rice husk contains around 45% silica (wt basis).in it on giving proper heal treatment the silica content can rise up to 99%. During heat treatment the silica in the rice fly ash obtain a zeolite type structure, on further activation with acid treatment it becomes<br><br>
actuated to adsorb colour pigments. The husk is used in furnaces or thrown as waste. Tin,1 nee husk can be burnt to prepare ash in furnaces, which can be used for preparation of bleaching material. Thus the waste material can be used effectively for oii bleach ins.; purpose. It can be a good substitute for imported bleaching earth.<br>
Description of the present invention: The rice husk obtained from rice shelling (rubber roll shellers) is first sun dried. Then it is washed with tap water to remove dirt, dust, foreign matter, fine powders of rice bran etc. The rice husk is sun dried to (7 - 10)% moisture content (wet basis). This husk was burnt to ashes through slow burning. This removes the organic matter present in the husk. The ash is then ground in ball mill to produce fine powder. This powder is kept into muffle furnace at about 850°C to 1200°C in a very thin layer. This removes the traces of organic matter present in ash and sites of silica present in the ash become available for adsorbing the colour pigments. The ash powder is to be kept in muffle furnace for 4 to 7 hours, then remove the ash from furnace and cool slowly. After this, the ash was boiled with concentrated H2SO4 for (2 - 3) hour at 102°C - 11()°C. Then this ash was washed with distill water until the pH becomes between (3.3 - 3.8). This ash was again ground to fine powder. Thus the activated rice husk ash is prepared.<br>
Filtered oil extracted of Laxmi variety of mustard by mechanical expeller was used to test the bleaching efficiency. The oil was degummed first and neutralized using NaOH. This oil was filtered and colour index was measured as 21 units (Y - 19, R - 0.4). The colour was measured using Lovibond Tintometer and colour was calculated using (Y^5 R) scale. The filtered oil was heated to (95°C - 130°C) and mixed with (2% - 4%) of bleaching material by weight. The oil and bleaching material were mixed thoroughly and stirred continuously for (20 - 30) minutes in shaking incubator under vacuum at same temperature. Then the oil was filtered and colour was measured. The colour index of the oil was found to vary from 7-9 units. The results were compared with Tonsil (standard bleaching earth). Colour index of the oil bleached by Tonsil varied from 4.5-7. I'hus, UK-bleaching material prepared from rice husk fly ash is good enough to be used for bleaching of edible oils.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
4.      We claim:<br>
1.	A new process in which rice husk fly ash can be converted into a bleaching<br>
material which can remove the colour, during refining of crude edible oil<br>

b)	slow burning, grinding in ball mill to produce fine powder,<br>
c)	keeping this powder in muffle furnace at a high temperature in a<br>
very thin layer for continous  4   to 7 hours<br>
d)	boiling it. with a solution of  98.2%  Concented H2SO1<br>
equal quantity of water filtering it and washed with water drying and<br>
grinding into fine powder.<br><br>

carried out in muffle furnace at a temperature of about 850°C - 1200°c.<br>
3.	The process according to claim 1, in which rice husk fly ash is treated with<br>
H2SO4 for a duraiion of two to three hours at a temperature of about 102°C<br>
tol10°C.<br>
4.	The process according to claim 1 provides a pH between 3.3 to 3.8 to the<br>
finally prepared rice husk fly ash into a bleaching material.<br>

'powder form, whose size is as below Passing through 120 Mesh =        90% Passing through 200 Mesh =        85% Passing through 240 Mesh =        35%<br>
6. The material obtained by the process of claim 1 when added to the edible oil at around 90° - 110°C and stirred constantly for a duration of 10 - 20 minutes. Then after filteration from whatman No. 4 filter paper, the filtered oil shows around 80 - 95% yellow colour removal and 20 - 30% red colour removal.<br><br><br></td>
