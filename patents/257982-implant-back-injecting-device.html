IMPLANT BACK-INJECTING DEVICE<br>
The present invention concerns an injection device and, in particular, a device for the intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of an active pharmaceutical principle in the solid or semisolid state, usually called an implant. More generally, the invention applies to the injection of a solid body for human or animal use such as for example electronic chips used for identifying a living being.<br>
Implant back injection devices of the type with which the present invention is concerned conventionally comprise a main hollow body, secured to a hollow needle into which the implant to be injected is introduced. A secondary body, arranged coaxially inside the main body, surrounds the needle in which a piston rod is able to slide coaxially. The purpose of this piston rod is to ensure that the implant is deposited at the proper depth in the subject tissue. When this back injection device is pressed against the subject tissue, the main body starts to slide along the secondary body from a proximal position to a distal position to allow the needle to penetrate the subject tissue. The movement of the main body is accompanied by a simultaneous movement of the piston rod, which, when the needle is withdrawn from the subject tissue, remains fixed relative to the needle so as to allow the implant to be kept at the required depth in the subject tissue.<br>
The method of use of such a back injection device is as follows. By holding the back injection device in one hand via its main body, the practitioner presses the distal end of the secondary body against the subject's skin. When the back injection device is suitably arranged, the practitioner pushes on the main body. Via the effect of this pressure, the main body starts to slide axially along the secondary body, allowing the needle, which is secured to said main body, to penetrate the subject's skin. At the same time, the main body drives the piston rod whose position relative to the needle and the implant therefore remains unchanged. It is at the moment that the needle has reached maximum penetration of the subject's tissue that the actual implant back injection operation occurs. Indeed, the practitioner, in a gesture not dissimilar to a conventional injection, will with his left hand if he is right handed, hold the back injection device against the subject's skin in order to minimise the movement of the needle and move his other hand so as to hold the secondary body against the skin via his thumb which presses on a button provided at the proximal end of the secondary body whereas, with his index finger and middle finger, he will control the return of the main body to its proximal position by using a finger rest fitted to said main body. During this gesture, the needle gradually exits the subject's tissue. The piston rod does not however accompany this movement of withdrawal by the main body. Indeed, retained by the secondary body, it is uncoupled from said main body and remains<br><br>
immobile, thus gradually penetrating the hollow needle as the latter exits the skin. The implant thus emerges from the needle, held in position at the correct depth in the skin via the distal end of the piston rod, which abuts against said implant. The piston rod is then uncoupled from the secondary body and coupled to the main body again such that the needle and the piston rod end the back injecting movement together in a position in which they are protected by the secondary body.<br>
In course of use, it has been observed that the use of a back injection device of the type described above is not always convenient and is often misunderstood by practitioners. Indeed, a large number of practitioners think that the gesture is finished once the needle has penetrated as deep as possible into the subject tissue, omitting to carry out the back injecting operation which alone allows the implant to be deposited in the subject tissue. Other practitioners have attempted to carry out the back injecting gesture by placing their thumb on the button of the secondary body and passing their index and middle fingers under the finger rest as indicated. However, these practitioners hold the main body firmly in their other hand, which makes it impossible for the main body to return to its proximal position and thus for the needle to exit the subject tissue. More generally, it has been deemed inconvenient and painful for the subject to have to hold the back injection device in one hand to press it against the subject's skin and push in the needle, then to have to release said device in order to perform the back injecting gesture with the other hand.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks in addition to others by providing an implant back injection device that simplifies as much as possible the implant injecting gesture under a subject's skin.<br>
The present invention therefore concerns a device for back injecting an implant into a subject's skin, this device including a hollow main body fixed to a hollow needle, into which the implant is introduced, a secondary body arranged coaxially inside the main body and surrounding the needle, and a piston rod able to slide coaxially inside said hollow needle, whose position relative to said needle remains unchanged when the back injection device is pressed against the subject's skin to allow the needle to penetrate the skin of said subject and when the secondary body retracts inside the main body, the piston rod being driven inside the hollow needle to maintain the implant at the required depth in the subject's skin during withdrawal of the hollow needle from the subject's skin, characterized in that it includes elastic means for returning the secondary body from the main body.<br>
Owing to these features, the present invention provides a device for back injecting an implant that needs only to be pressed against the subject's skin until the needle has completely penetrated the skin, the secondary body then automatically<br><br>
exiting the main body to cover the needle gradually as the back injection device is moved away from the subject's skin and the implant injection operation is carried out. The implant injection operation is thus entirely automated as soon as the needle is inserted into the tissue, which makes it as simple as possible and in particular removes the relatively complicated back injecting gesture which had to be performed with the devices of the prior art. Moreover, it is not necessary to change the manner in which the device according to the invention is held during the implant back injecting operation, which also facilitates the practitioner's work. It should also be noted that the secondary body caps the hollow needle, into which the implant is introduced, before and after the injection, which prevents any risk of scratch or contamination of the needle and the practitioner.<br>
According to a complementary feature of the invention, the back injection device includes a retaining element for preventing the implant from falling prior to the use of said device.<br>
According to a first variant, the retaining element includes an elastic tongue which, in the rest position, via an end part bent towards the inside of the volume of the retaining element, closes the hole for the passage of the hollow needle and which, when the back injection device is pressed against the subject's skin, moves away to free the passage for said hollow needle.<br>
According to a second variant, the retaining element includes an elastic tongue above which the hollow needle passes and which, in the storage position of the back injection device, is bent towards the inside of the volume of said retaining element, such that the needle is moved away from its general forward direction, the elastic tongue covering its rest position in which it enables said needle to be realigned and to move forward when said back injection device is pressed against the subject's skin.<br>
These two variants of the implant retaining device have a common advantage, which lies in the fact that the hollow needle does not have to push via its bevel against an element of the injection device in order to pave its way towards the exit of said device. The needle bevel is not therefore likely to be damaged and the risks of injecting into the subject's skin fragments of the plastic material of which the injection device is made are avoided.<br>
According to another feature of the invention, the back injection device further includes a sheath, which cooperates with the secondary body to allow the back injection device to be irreversibly locked after use. More specifically, the secondary body is locked onto the sheath, which is itself locked onto the main body.<br><br>
The back injection device is thus totally locked after use, which makes any subsequent re-use of the device impossible and especially prevents any risk of the practitioner pricking himself with the soiled needle.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the sheath also temporarily locks the back injection device before use.<br>
The back injection device is only activated at the moment when it is pressed against the subject's skin, which removes any possibility of the practitioner accessing the needle prior to carrying out the injection and soiling the needle by pricking himself.<br>
According to yet another feature of the invention, the elastic return means include a spring which, at one of its ends, abuts on the secondary body, and which, at its other end, abuts against a base that carries the hollow needle and which is secured to the main body.<br>
When the needle is pushed into the subject's skin, the collar moves upward by sliding axially inside the main body, such that the spring compresses. Then, when it reaches a turning point which corresponds to the maximum point of penetration of the needle into the skin, the collar pivots and slides again in the opposite direction in the main body, which allows the spring to be let down. Thus, with the exception of the collar, all of the moving parts of the back injection device according to the invention move only axially, which guarantees reliable operation of the device. Indeed, when the back injection device is pressed against the subject's skin, this generates friction forces that could interfere with the proper operation of the device if the part in contact with the skin had to perform a pivoting movement.<br>
According to a first variant, the secondary body is a hollow body of substantially cylindrical shape provided with two rectilinear, diametrically opposite slots which extend from the proximal end of said secondary body to a determined height above the distal end of the back injection device, these slots defining two tube portions.<br>
According to a second variant, the secondary body includes a single tube portion.<br>
This second variant is preferred to the first in that it avoids tolerance problems linked to the manufacture of various parts forming the back injection device.<br>

Hereafter, the "proximal" end means the end located on the side of the practitioner, and the "distal" end means the end located on the side of the subject to whom the injection is being administered.<br>
One starts by removing the back injection device according to the invention from its secondary packaging (not shown). Designated as a whole by the general reference numeral 1, the back injection device includes first (see Figures 1A and 1B) a cap 2 that covers its distal end 4. In order to carry out the back-injection, this cap 2 must first of all be removed by exerting thereon a slight traction force along the longitudinal axis X-X of said back injection device 1. During this movement, a sheath 6 extended at the distal end thereof by a retaining element 8 is uncovered (see Figures 2A and 2B), these two elements projecting from the main body 10 of back injection device 1. As will be seen in more detail hereafter, retaining element 8 is secured to secondary body 2 that extends coaxially inside main body 10.<br>
The back injecting operation cannot start until a staple shaped member 14 has also been removed, said staple shaped member (see Figure 2C) having at the base<br><br>
thereof a stud 16 via which it is engaged in corresponding holes made respectively in main body 10, sheath 6 and secondary body 12. Thus, for as long as staple shaped member 14 is in place, main body 10, sheath 6 and secondary body 12 are coupled to each other, which makes any axial movement of these elements relative to the others impossible and therefore prevents the back-injection being carried out. It should be noted that cap 2 has a recess 18 via which it covers arms 20 of staple shaped member 14 which match the substantially circular shape of the distal end of main body 10. It is thus impossible to withdraw staple shaped member 14 before having removed cap 2, which offers additional security against any inadvertent activation of back injection device 1 according to the invention.<br>
After removing cap 2 and staple shaped member 14, the actual back-injection operation may begin. In order to do this, the practitioner activates injection device 1 by pressing via its retaining element 8 against the subject's skin 22. Via the effect of this pressing, retaining element 8 slightly penetrates inside sheath 6 (see Figure 3). This retaining element 8 includes (see Figures 4A and 4B) an elastic tongue 24, which, in the rest position, closes via an end part 25 bent towards the interior of the volume of retaining element 8, the clearance hole 26 for a hollow needle 28 arranged coaxially to the inside of secondary body 12 and in which the implant 30 to be administered to the subject is engaged. As sheath 6 has on the inner periphery of the distal end thereof two inclined planes 32 which will abut on elastic tongue 24 during the forward movement of retaining element 8 inside said sheath 6 (see Figures 5A and 5B), said tongue 24 will move away from its rest position and thus free the passage for needle 28 (see Figures 6A and 6B). Hollow needle 28 is thus not forced to pave a path by pushing, via its bevel 33, an element of device 1, which means that said bevel 33 is not damaged and there is no risk of injecting fragments of plastic material into the subject's skin 22. It will also be noted that the inclined planes 32 are used to index the position of retaining element 8 inside sheath 6. Thus, retaining element 8 has a rib that projects slightly relative to its outer cylindrical surface and which slides between said two inclined planes 32.<br>
The main body 10 has on the inner periphery of the distal end thereof at least one, and preferably two diametrically opposite housings 36 into which two elastic substantially V-shaped arms 38 project provided at the proximal end of sheath 6 (see Figures 7A and 7B). These two arms 38 have two functions. The first of these functions is to temporarily immobilise said sheath 6 relative to said main body 10 in the storage position of the back injection device 1 according to the invention. The secondary body 12 thus has on the outer periphery thereof two diametrically opposite plane portions 39 which, in the storage position, hold elastic arms 38 of sheath 6 in<br><br>
housings 36 arranged in the inner surface of main body 10 (see Figure 8B). It will be noted that the elastic arms 38 each have at their base a snug 42, which projects into the corresponding housing 36. Consequently, when back injection device 1 is pressed, via the distal end of its retaining element 8, against the subject's skin 22, said retaining element 8, secured to secondary body 12, slightly raises the latter inside main body 10, such that inclined planes 40 arranged on the outer periphery of said secondary body 12 move away from elastic arms 38 which are thus free to bend (see Figure 8C). The snugs 42 are then released from their positioned engaged in housings 36, such that sheath 6 is uncoupled from main body 10 and is allowed to move up inside the latter. It will also be noted that sheath 6 has two truncated edges 43 via which it abuts against an inner shoulder 45 provided at the distal end of main body 10.<br>
The second function of elastic arms 38 is the final locking of secondary body 12 on sheath 6 as will be described hereafter.<br>
As was seen above, a first solution that can be envisaged for retaining hollow needle 28 and preventing implant 30 from falling prior to injection is to provide, on the path of said needle 28, an elastic tongue 24, which in the rest position, blocks bevel 33 of needle 28 and which in the activated position, is moved away from the path of needle 28 to enable the latter to move forward and implant 30 to be deposited in the subject's tissue. According to a preferred variant (see Figures 9A and 9B), retaining element 8 includes an elastic tongue 46 above which needle 28 passes and which, in the storage position of back injection device 1, is bent towards the inside of the volume of retaining element 8 by a snug 48 provided on the inner surface of sheath 6. Needle 28 is thus slightly moved away from its general direction of forward movement along the longitudinal axis of symmetry X-X of back injection device 1 such that, if the implant slides partially out of needle 28 via the effect of its weight, it will abut against the distal end of retaining element 8, which will prevent it from falling. Subsequently, when back-injection device 1 is pressed against the subject's skin 22, retaining element 8 slightly penetrates the interior of sheath 6, such that snug 48 moves away from tongue 46 which returns to its rest position and which allows needle 28 to align itself along the longitudinal axis of symmetry X-X of injection device 1 and clearance hole 26. Additionally, an arch 50 may be provided at the end of tongue 46 for better axial guiding of hollow needle 28.<br>
The position of secondary body 12 is indexed relative to sheath 6 via its two inclined planes 40 which have to be slid into the hollows of elastic V-shaped arms 38. As regards the position of sheath 6 relative to main body 10, this is indexed by at least one and preferably two diametrically opposite snugs 52 (see Figure 7A) which are<br><br>
engaged in the longest grooves 54 of two cam paths 56 arranged in the inner lateral wall of main body 10 (see Figure 12A).<br>
Hollow needle 28 is carried (see Figure 10A) by a substantially cylindrical holding part called the base and designated as a whole by the general reference numeral 58. The proximal end of base 58 is cut into slots that form tongues 60 provided with raised portions at the base thereof. These raised portions 62 project into corresponding apertures 64 arranged at the proximal end of main body 10 for locking base 58 to said main body 10 (see Figure 10B). Moreover, base 58 is capped by an end cap 66 (see Figure 11 A), which has at the base thereof a notch 68 housing an indexing portion 70 provided on main body 10.<br>
Towards its distal end, base 58 includes a tube portion 72 which defines a through aperture 74 for holding hollow needle 28 by friction and or bonding and which is connected to hollow cylindrical body 59 of base 58 by one and preferably two diametrically opposite ribs 76.<br>
A sleeve 78 of cylindrical shape extends coaxially inside end cap 66. As described in detail hereafter, cap 66 also includes a bar 84 which extends along a diameter inside sleeve 78 and to which there is secured by gripping the head 86 of a piston rod 88 able to slide inside hollow needle 28 to hold implant 30 in placed at the moment of back-injection (see Figure 11C).<br>
As already mentioned above, main body 10 has on its inner surface at least one and preferably two diametrically opposite cam paths 56 each formed of two longitudinal rectilinear grooves 54 and 90, one 54 of which is longer than the other 90. A collar 92 is used as a support piece for a spring 94 (see Figures 12A and 12B). In the storage position of back-injection device 1, this spring 94 is slightly prestressed. As will be seen hereafter, this spring 94 will be compressed further as soon as said back-injection device 1 is pressed against the subject's skin 22 and will again be allowed to be let down at the moment of actual back-injection. Collar 92 is able to slide inside main body 10 and for this purpose has at its periphery two diametrically opposite snugs 96 which are capable of each cooperating with one or other of the two grooves 54, 90 of the cam paths 56 as a function of the angular position of said collar 92 inside said main body 10 (see Figures 13A and 13B). This position is controlled by secondary body 12 which has a cam surface 98 for this purpose (see Figures 14A to 14C) against which collar 92 abuts via a cam path 100 arranged in its inner surface. When snugs 96 carried by collar 92 exit the shortest grooves 90, said collar 92, constrained by spring 94, slides via its cam path 100 along the cam surface 98 of secondary body 12, which forces it to pivot, its snugs 96 then penetrating the longest grooves 54 allowing spring 94 to be let down again.<br><br>
Secondary body 12 is a hollow body of generally cylindrical shape provided with two rectilinear diametrically opposite slots 102 which extend from the proximal end of said secondary body 12 to a height h above distant end 4 of back-injection device 1. As will be seen hereafter, this height h determines the depth of penetration of hollow needle 28 into the subject's skin 22. Indeed, slots 102 define two tube portions 12a and 12b which pass right through tube portion 72 in which hollow needle 28 is fixed and which penetrate the interior of hollow cylindrical body 59 of base 58 (see Figure 15). Thus, this base 58 is free to slide along secondary body 12 until ribs 76, via which tube portion 72 is connected to body 59 of said base 58, is stopped at the bottom of slots 102. Moreover, the two tube portions 12a, 12b pass on either sides of bar 84 and penetrate the interior of sleeve 78 which they exit via proximal end 103 of back-injection device 1. The two tube portions 12a, 12b of secondary body 12 are thus capable of gradually emerging from main body 10 as hollow needle 28 penetrates the subject's skin 22.<br>
Finally, secondary body 12 includes on the inner face of the two tube portions 12a, 12b locking means 104, for example in the form of two beads (see Figures 16A and 16B). For a detailed description of these locking means 104, reference can usefully be made to European Patent Application No. 04028413.5 in the name of the Applicant. The function of locking means 104 is to uncouple head 86 of piston rod 88 from main body 10 and to couple it to secondary body 12. Indeed, after use, head 86 of piston rod 88 is gripped by two elastic clips 106 on bar 84, which extends diametrically inside sleeve 78 of end cap 66. Gradually as hollow needle 28 penetrates the subject's skin 22, the two tube portions 12a, 12b of secondary body 12 emerge from main body 10, such that the two beads 104 meet head 86 of piston rod 88 and end up passing behind the latter by deforming elastically (see Figures 17A and 17B). During the actual back injection operation, the progressive withdrawal of hollow needle 28 out of the subject's skin 2 is controlled. Piston rod 88 does not however accompany this movement of withdrawal (see Figures 18A and 18B). Indeed, since beads 104 retain its head 86, it is uncoupled from main body 10 (more specifically from end cap 66) and remains immobile, thus gradually penetrating hollow needle 28 as the latter exits the subject's skin 22. Implant 30 thus emerges from needle 28, held in position at the correct depth in skin 22 by the distal end of piston rod 88, which is abutting against said implant 30. During the downward movement of secondary body 12 relative to main body 10, the proximal end of base 58 meets head 86 of piston rod 88. As during the upward movement of secondary body 12 inside main body 10, locking means 104 carried by secondary body 12 will pass by head 86 of piston rod 88 by deforming elastically, thereby uncoupling head 86 of piston rod 88 from secondary<br><br>
body 12 and coupling it again to main body 10 in order to allow the downward movement of secondary body 12 to continue and thereby allow the latter to cover needle 28 and piston rod 88 (see Figures 19A and 19B).<br>
As illustrated in Figures 20A to 20C, spring 94 is stopped at the distal end thereof against collar 92 and at the proximal end thereof against base 58. Gradually as sheath 6 retracts inside main body 10 when back-injection device 1 is pressed against the subject's skin 22, secondary body 12 drives with it collar 92, which abuts via its cam path 100 against the cam surface 98 of said secondary body 12. During this movement of translation, snugs 96 of collar 92 slide along the shortest grooves 90 of the two cam paths 56 arranged in the inner wall of main body 10. Once it reaches the return point, defined by the place where the shortest grooves 90 communicate with the longest grooves 54 (see Figure 21A), collar 92, which is no longer being guided axially, pivots while following via its cam path 100 the cam surface 98 arranged on secondary body 12 (see Figure 21B). This event is concomitant with the passage of locking means 104 of secondary body 12 behind head 86 of piston rod 88. At this moment, snugs 96 of collar 92 penetrate the longest grooves 54 of cam paths 56, allowing spring 94 to be let down again (see Figure 21C). By letting down, spring 94 pushes secondary body 12 forward, in the direction of exit from main body 10. The thrust force of spring 94 is transmitted to secondary body 12 via collar 92. Simultaneously, secondary body 12 pushes forward sheath 6 in the direction of exit from main body 10. Secondary body 12 transmits it thrust force to sheath 6 via its inclined planes 40, which abut against the bottom of the V-shaped elastic arms 38. In fact, these arms, abutting against the inner wall of main body 10, are not allowed to move apart. The exit movement of sheath 6 out of main body 10 is interrupted when said sheath 6 abuts via its truncated edges 43 against inner shoulder 45 provided at the distal end of main body 10. In this position, snugs 42 of elastic arms 38 are facing housing 36, such that said arms 38 are again allowed to deform elastically towards the outside of the volume of main body 10 (see Figure 22B). This allows the corresponding inclined planes 40 arranged on secondary body 12 to slide under elastic arms 38. It will be noted that, since longitudinal grooves 54 of cam paths 56 are longer than the grooves 90 in which snugs 96 of collar 92 move, when hollow needle 28 is pushed into the subject's skin 22, at the moment when the back-injection occurs and when secondary body 12 again emerges from main body 10, said secondary body 12 is allowed to move slightly beyond the position which it has initially before injection device 1 was pressed against skin 22. Advantage is taken of this additional movement in order to make the base of V-shaped elastic arms 38 fall into two diametrically opposite slots 108 located between the feet of inclined planes 40 and two longitudinal<br><br>
edges 110 (see Figure 22C). Consequently, secondary body 12 is locked onto sheath 6 which is itself locked onto main body 10, such that back-injection device 1 according to the invention is totally locked after use.<br>
We will now consider the operation of back-injection device 1 according to the invention with reference to Figures 23A to 23G. After having removed the device from its packaging (Figure 23A) cap 2 is first removed then staple shaped member 14 (Figure 23B). Back injection device 1 is then ready for use. While holding device 1 by its main body 10, it is applied against subject's skin (Figure 23c). The presence of a corrugated rib 112 that extends over one part of the length of back-injection device 1 ensures that the latter is held firmly. Retaining element 8 is pressed against the subject's skin 22. The effect of this pressing is that retaining element 8 penetrates slightly the interior of sheath 6, which has the effect of moving elastic tongue 24 away from its rest position and freeing the passage for hollow needle 28.<br>
Simultaneously, retaining element 8 pushes secondary body 12, to which it is secured, backwards, which moves inclined planes 40, arranged on secondary body 12, to move away from elastic arms 38, which are then able to bend. Subsequently, snugs 42 provided at the base of elastic arms 38 are released from their position engaged in housings 36 provided at the distal end of main body 10, such that sheath 6 is uncoupled from said main body 10. Retaining element 8 continues to penetrate the interior of sheath 6 until it is stopped against the distal end thereof. Retaining element 8 then exerts a thrust on sheath 6 on the one hand, and on secondary body 12 on the other hand, such that these two parts start to retract inside main body 10. It will be noted that during this movement, the relative position of sheath 6 in relation to secondary body 12 remains unchanged. As sheath 6 and secondary body 12 retract, hollow needle 28 gradually emerges from main body 10 and penetrates the subject's skin 22 (Figure 23D). The movement of withdrawal of secondary body 12 is allowed because the two tube portions 12a, 12b of which it is formed exit via the proximal end of back-injection device 1 by sliding inside sleeve 78, passing right through bar 84, which extends radially inside said sleeve 78 (Figure 23E)<br>
By moving up inside main body 10, secondary body 12 meets head 86 of piston rod 88, which is held initially coupled to main body 10 via its two elastic clips 106 clamped onto bar 84 of sleeve 78. The two beads 104 arranged on the inner face of tube portions 12a, 12b thus reach the height of head 86 of piston rod 88 and pass behind the latter by deforming elastically. In parallel, secondary body 12 drives with it collar 92, which slides via its snugs 96 along the shortest grooves 90 of cam paths 56 arranged diametrically opposite each other in the inner wall of said main body 10.<br><br>
Spring 94, abutting against collar 92, which moves up inside main body 10 and against base 58 which is fixed, is compressed.<br>
When collar 92 reaches the point of return where the shortest grooves 90 communicate with the longest grooves 54 of cam paths 56, the two beads 104 pass right through head 86 of piston rod 88. Moreover, said collar 92 which, at that moment, is no longer guided axially, is forced to pivot via the effect of the pressure exerted by spring 94 and is engaged via its snugs 96 in the longest grooves 56. At that moment, spring 94 is again allowed to be let down and pushes secondary body 12 forward, which itself exerts a thrust on sheath 8 in the direction of exit from main body 10 (Figure 23F). During the exit movement of secondary body 12, beads 104 retain head 86 of piston rod 88, which uncouples from main body 10 and is again coupled to secondary body 12. Piston rod 88 thus remains immobile, gradually penetrating hollow needle 28 to hold implant 30 in position at the correct depth in the subject's skin 22.<br>
The forward movement of sheath 6 is interrupted when the latter is stopped via its two truncated edges 43 against the inner shoulder 45 provided at the distal end of main body 10. Simultaneously, secondary body 12 slides via its inclined planes 40 under elastic arms 38. The latter are housed in two the two slots 108 provided behind said inclined planes 40. Secondary body 12 is thus locked onto sheath 6 which is itself locked onto main body 10 via its elastic arms 38, whose snugs 42 engage in housings 36 of main body 10. The back-injection device 1 according to the invention is thus totally and irreversibly locked (Figure 23G).<br>
A preferred variant of back-injection device 1 according to the invention will now be examined. Elements that are identical to those described in conjunction with the preceding embodiment are designated by the same reference numeral sand will not be described further here. According to this preferred embodiment of the invention, the secondary body, designated here by the reference numeral 114, comprises only a single tube portion 114a, which substantially corresponds to half of the cylindrical envelope in which said secondary body 114 is inscribed (see Figures 24A and 24B). This tube portion 114a thus delimits an aperture 116 into which a longitudinal elastic arms 118 extends, ending at the free end thereof in a raised portion 129 oriented on the inner side of said tube 114a. The base of hollow needle 28 (see Figures 25A and 25B), designated here by the reference 122, essentially comprises one tube portion 124, which defines a through aperture 126 for friction holding and/or bonding said needle 28 and which is extended by a rectilinear groove 128, which has a straight U-shaped cross-section for cooperating with the shape of secondary body 114. The body 130 of base 122 is formed by a cylinder portion 132,<br><br>
which is attached to the opposite vertical flanks 128a of groove 128 so as to delimit an annular passage 134 in which tube portion 114a of secondary body 114 can slide (see Figure 32). An aperture 136, whose role will be described below, is also arranged in the bottom 128b of groove 128. Finally, body 130 of base 122 ends in a button 138 comprising two raised portions 140 for projecting into two corresponding apertures 142 arranged at the proximal end of main body 144 for immobilising said base 122 on said main body 144. In this case, end cap 66 provided in the first embodiment, is no longer necessary. A notch 146, in the same plane and in the extension of aperture 136 is also made in button 138.<br>
The head 148 of piston rod 88 includes a snug 150, which in the storage position of back-injection device 1 according to the invention, projects into notch 146 of button 138, which couples said piston rod 88 to main body 144 via base 122 (see Figure 26B). Snug 150 of head 148 of piston rod 88 is connected via an inclined plane 152 to a heel 154. Gradually as hollow needle 28 penetrates the subject's skin 22, secondary body 114 moves up inside main body 144 by sliding along base 122 (see Figure 27B). Shortly before needle 28 is completely pushed in to the subject's skin 22, head 148 of piston rod 88 slides via its heel 154 over the raised portion 120 of elastic arm 118, which moves away from its rest position. Finally, head 148 passes raised portion 120 and its heel 154 falls into aperture 116. At that moment, head 148 of piston rod 88 is coupled on the one hand to main body 144 and on the other to secondary body 114 (see Figure 27C). Collar 92, changes groove, and spring 94 is compressed to the maximum.<br>
When the back-injection begins, spring 94 lets down and secondary body 114 again slides along base 122 but in the direction of exit from main body 144 this time. Snug 150 of head 148 of piston rod 88, retained by raised portion 120 (see Figure 28B), is released from main body 144 and slides along the bottom 128b of groove 128 until the moment that it is facing aperture 136 (see Figures 29B and 29C). At this moment, piston rod 88 relaxes and snug 150 penetrates said aperture 136, its heel 154 being released from raised portion 120. Piston rod 88 is thus again coupled to base 122, in other words to main body 144, which allows secondary body 114 to travel the distance necessary for the complete withdrawal of needle 28 from the subject's skin 22 and the protection of the latter inside back-injection device according to the invention (see Figure 30). In this position, implant 30 has been maintained at the correct depth in the subject's skin 22, all that remains is to finish removing needle 28 and piston rod 88 from skin 22. In order to do this, piston rod 88, again secured to main body 144, is withdrawn concomitantly with needle 28.<br><br>
It goes without saying that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments that have just been described and that various simple alterations and variants could be envisaged by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the annexed claims. One could in particular envisage that the spring, instead of being practically let down in the storage position of the back-injection device, is, conversely, compressed and lets down during the return of the secondary body out of the main body. According to a variant shown in Figure 31, the two tube portions 12a, 12b could be held together by snapping onto a cap 156 during the entire use of back-injection device 1 according to the invention. Thus, the two tube portions 12a, 12b each have a raised portion 158, which defines a catching surface 160 on an inner edge 162 of cap 156. The function of cap 158 is also to temporarily couple head 86 to piston rod 88 and main body 10 in the storage position of back-injection device 1. Thus, head 86 of piston rod 88 takes the form of a pair of clips 163 passed through a central sleeve 164 arranged inside end cap 66 and each having a raised portion 166 defining a catching surface 168 on sleeve 164. In the storage position, clips 163 are held apart from each other by a conical tip 170, which stands on the inner surface of cap 156. When back-injection device 1 is activated, secondary body 12 gradually exits main body 10, such that tip 170 is released from clips 162. The latter are then allowed to move closer to each other and can slide inside sleeve 164, thereby uncoupling head 88 of piston rod 88 from main body 10.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

the two tube portions (12a, 12b) include locking means (104).<br>
25.	Implant back injection device according to claim 24, characterized in that the piston rod (88) includes a head (86) via which said rod is coupled to the bar (84) to be driven by the main body (10) when the needle (28) penetrates the subject's skin (22), and via which said rod cooperates with the locking means (104) in order to be uncoupled from said main body (10) and coupled to the secondary body (12) when the needle (28) is withdrawn from the subject's skin (22).<br>
26.	Implant back injection device according to any of claims 5 to 20, characterized in that the base (122) includes a tube portion (124), which defines a through hole (126) for holding the hollow needle (28) and which is extended by a rectilinear groove (128) on the opposite flanks (128a) to which a cylinder portion (132) is attached so as to delimit an annular passage (134), an aperture (136) being arranged in the bottom (128b) of said groove, the base (122) further including at the proximal end thereof a button (138) in which a notch (146) is made.<br>
27.	Implant back injection device according to claim 26, characterized in that secondary body (114) includes a single tube portion (114a), which is capable of sliding into the annular space (134), an elastic arm (118) ending at the free end thereof in a raised portion (120) extending into an aperture arranged in the tube portion (114a).<br>
28.	Implant back injection device according to claim 27, characterized in that the piston rod (88) includes a head (148) via which it is coupled to the button (138) to be driven by the main body (10) when the needle (28) penetrates the subject's skin (22), and via which said rod cooperates with the secondary body (114) to remain immobile when the needle (28) is withdrawn from the subject's skin (22).<br><br>
29.     Implant back injection device according to claim 28, characterized in that the head (148) of the piston rod (88) includes a snug (150), which, in the storage position of the back injection device (1), projects into the notch (146) of the button (138), the snug (150) being connected via an inclined plane (152) to a heel (154) via which said snug (150) slides over the raised portion (120) of the elastic arm (118) and finishes by passing over the latter to fall into the aperture (116), at the moment when the needle (28) is completely pushed into the subject's skin (22), the snug (150) being subsequently retained by the raised portion (120), which allows said snug to be uncoupled from said main body (144) gradually as the secondary body (114) exits said main body (144) again, until the moment when said snug (150) is facing the aperture (136) and penetrates the latter, the heel (154) thereof being uncoupled from the raised portion (120), such that the piston rod (88) is again coupled to the main body (144), which allows the secondary body (114) to travel the distance necessary for the complete withdrawal of the needle (28) from the subject's skin (22).<br><br></td>
