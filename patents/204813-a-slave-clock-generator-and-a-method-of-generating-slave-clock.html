" A SLAVE CLOCK GENRATOR AND A METHOD OF GENTATING A SLAVE CLOCK"<br>
SEMTECH   CORPORATION,   of   652   Mitchell   Road,   Newbury   Park, California 91320, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to a slave clock generator and a method of generating a slave clock.<br>
This invention relates to the field of synchronous telecommunications  networks,  and  particularly  to  the generation of slave clocks that are synchronized to a  reference clock source for use in such a network.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Large telecommunications networks consist of switching engines and transmission lines, Digital networks support services whose signals may be either analog or digital in origin, with analog signals carried through a digital network by representing them as a sequence of digital words.<br>
Two  main  types  of  digital   telecommunications networks  exist:  circuit-switched  and  packet-switched. Circuit-switched  networks  evolved  to  carry  real-time services, such as    voice, while packet-switched networks evolved to carry data-oriented services.  Until recently, separate networks were needed for circuit-switched and packet-switched architectures, and large differences were to  be  found  in  the  elements  of  equipment  used  to construct them.   This separation is costly in terms of equipment  cost,  maintenance,  and  operation  of  the networks.  It  has  been  recognized  for  some  time  that efficiencies  could  be  realized  if  both  types  of architecture could co-exist on the same network, but a number of hurdles must first be overcome.<br>
For many years, voice traffic has been dominant and has led the circuit-switched networks to dwarf packet-switched  networks.    Although  non-voice  services  are<br><br><br>
growing rapidly, the size of the circuit-switched networks must be considered when trying to make a common network. Due  to the large amount of circuit-switched equipment that is already in place, using such a network for both voice and data traffic is desirable. However, a relatively high error-rate is inherent in the make-up of circuit-switched networks, which is unsuitable to the demands of packet-based communications.<br>
One way in which voice or data traffic can become corrupted is when samples are lost due to consecutive switches operating at slightly different rates.  The rate of transmission through a first switch is determined by the speed of the switching clock provided to that switch. Similarly,  the rate of consumption of signals at the inp it of a second switch is determined by the speed of the switching clock provided to the second switch.  When the rate of consumption matches the rate of arrival, the switches operate error-free. However, when the rate of consumption  differs  from  the  rate  of  arrival,  the switches generate errors, the cumulative effect of which can become quite large as a signal propagates through a network.  Buffers can be placed on the inputs of switches to accommodate differences in transmission rates,  but these introduce delays which can also have a detrimental effect on the quality of the received signal.<br>
These difficulties make the use of circuit-switched networks to carry packets problematic.   Because of the need  to  re-transmit  packets  containing  errors,  the throughput of a packet-switched network is significantly reduced  when  even  a  small  error  rate  is  present. Uncorrupted transmission of digital signals through and between switches depends upon the relative accuracy with which the individual switch clocks operate.   To reduce error-rates in the switches, it is necessary to run the switches  at  the  same  rate.    Modern  communications<br><br>
networks typically have a hierarchal clock distribution structure to distribute a common clock to all switches. Switches can synchronize to a clock from either a higher-level switch or from a peer-level switch, if needed. Zach switch is therefore a source of a clock signal for neighboring switches. Each time a clock is regenerated, the new clock is termed to be a "slave" of the clock from which it was derived (a "master" clock).<br>
Clock distribution networks are prone to occasional failures, and keeping the network operating during an outage is a prime requirement.   For this reason,  the distribution network must have some degree of resilience and  self-healing.  Three  operating  modes  have  been identified ir the various standards that govern large synchronous  telecommunications  networks:  locked  mode, holdover mode and free-running mode.  These modes reflect the three stages of operation of a distribution network element.   On power-up,  the clock generation hardware enters the "free-running" mode.  In this mode, the local slave clock is intended to be stable and close to the nominal  network  rate,  but  is  not  required  to  be synchronous.  The free-running mode is usually retained until a good synchronization source is detected from a higher-level or peer-level element.  The 'locked mode' of operation is used when a good synchronization source has been detected, at which point the local slave clock is driven into synchronization with the incoming clock.  If the synchronization source fails,  the clock generator enters the "holdover mode".   In this mode,  the local slave clock is generated to be as close as possible to the last-known-good value of the incoming clock.   This requires  some  stored  history of  the  behavior of  the incoming clock.  Clock generation reverts to locked mode when a good synchronization source is detected.<br>
Thus, the slave clock generator is a critical item<br><br>
of  equipment  in a  clock distribution network.   This system  has  to  detect  the  presence  and  absence  of synchronization.  sources,  generating  the  slave  clock either in synchronism with the best source, when present, or  in  very  close  approximation  to  it,  when  absent. Traditionally,  the. performance requirements imposed by the   various   celecommunications   networks   standards (chiefly  ITU-T G.783,  G.811-813,  Bellcore GR-253-CORE, and ETSI 300462 (parts 1 to 6)) have been met using a voltage-controlled  oscillator  (VCO).     The  VCO  is controlled by a control algorithm implemented in software and running on a microprocessor, which takes inputs from a number of sensors (e.g., temperature and voltage) and a phase comparator and generates a control voltage that causes the VCO to milic a selected master reference source, thereby generating a slave clock.<br>
There are several drawbacks to the use of a VCO for slave clock generation,  however.   Though a VCO-based system could, in principle, be integrated onto a single semiconductor substrate, its use  of disparate components does not make this task easy.  The operation of embedded microprocessors,  instruction  and  data  memories,  and assorted other digital functions, are not compatible with the operation of sensitive analog components  such as comparators and VCOS.  Furthermore, the electrical noise generated  by  the  digital  components  can  degrade  the operation of the analog components.  In particular, noise appearing  on  the  control  input  of  a  VCO  leads  to variations in the output frequency,  otherwise known as jitter.     Maximum  jitter  specifications   for  this application are typically   tight, meaning that only very low levels of noise can be tolerated.  Noise control is difficult when digital components are mounted close to analog components, as would be necessary with an fully integrated implementation.<br><br>
Noise problems are also present in discrete VCO implementations,  but precautions taken in the circuit board layout can render a design workable.   However, these precautions  are  dependent  upon various  factors which are frequently out of the control of the designer of  the  slave  clock  generator.     This  makes  each implementation  unique,  because  the  layout  has  to  be carefully  considered  each  time  a  new  design  is implemented.  Using discrete components can also lead to unacceptable  levels  of  space  and  power  consumption. Finally, both discrete and integrated VCO-based systems require  extensive  calibration  procedures  needed  to provide the temperature compensation necessary to meet the performance specifications.   This is time-consuming and expensive.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A slave clock generation system and method are presented which are suitable for use with synchronous telecommunications networks. One or more slave clocks are generated from a selected reference clock using a direct digital synthesis technique, which greatly reduces the system's sensitivity to noise. The invention is capable of meeting very tight frequency deviation specifications, and can be integrated on a common substrate, reducing space and power consumption.<br>
The slave clock generation system includes a multiplexer which selects a reference clock from a number of available clock signals, each of which can be at its own spot frequency. Toggle detectors preferably monitor each of the available clock sources, and block the selection of any that are not within a specified frequency range. A local oscillator is used to establish a "short-term measurement period"; the cycles of the selected  reference clock are counted over consecutive<br><br>
short-term measurement periods to determine the relative frequency of the selected clock with respect to the frequency of the local oscillator. The cycle counts are fed to a phase-to-clock converter, which produces a slave clock output having a frequency that varies with the relative frequency measured for the selected clock.<br>
Rounding errors which can introduce inaccuracies into the frequency of the slave clock are countered by monitoring both the generated slave clock and the selected reference clock over a "long-term measurement period", which is also established by the local oscillator. The difference between these two cycle counts is used in a feedback path to correct the output frequency.<br>
The invention is capable of operating in locked, holdover,  and  free-running modes,  and  is  capable  of meeting the frequency deviation specifications given for each mode.   In locked mode, a deviation of 3 parts per billion or less is maintained, while a drift of less than 4.6 parts per million per month is achieved in holdover mode.     The  invention  does  not  require  a  local microprocessor,  and  its  mostly-digital  implementation enables     it  to be  integrated  on  a common     substrate, realizing both space and power consumption advantages. Che    mostly-digital     implementation    also    greatly    reduces the adverse affects of noise, whether generated  on-chip or elsewhere on the printed circuit board (PCB) to which the chip is mounted.<br>
Further features and advantages of the invention fill be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, taken together with the ccompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A slave clock generator 10 per the present invention is shown in FIG. 1.  A number of reference clock sources (or "master" clocks)  12 are  typically available  from which one or more slave clocks can be generated.   The reference sources are supplied by, for example, the clock recovery  circuits  of  high-speed  and  low-speed  line interfaces and a port on a local synchronous distribution network.   Many reference sources offer two selectable frequencies (such as   38.88 MHZ or 77.76 MHZ, 6.48 MHZ or 19.44 MHZ, or 1.54 MHZ or 2.048 MHZ), with the selection performed  by  network  management  components  that  are outside the scope of this patent.  The reference sources may be generated by components from a variety of logic<br><br><br>
families, such as positive ecl (pecl) or ttl, and for maximum flexibility, slave clock generator 10 is preferably arranged to support each possibility. The slave clock generator shown in FIG. 1 is arranged to receive a maximum of six reference sources as inputs, though the invention is not limited to any particular maximum input count.<br>
Slave  clock generator  10  also  receives  a  local oscillator clock 14 as   an input.   One of the reference sources is selected to be the source from which one or more slave clocks are to be generated.  By using direct digital synthesis techniques (described in detail below), the slave clock generator produces one or more slave clock outputs 16 which are derived from the selected reference  source.    Again,  for  purposes  of  maximum flexibility, the slave clock generator preferably offers several slave clock outputs having different frequencies, which oscillate between the high and low logic levels of a variety of logic families.  The slave clock generator 10 may also be arranged to offer selectable frequencies on each output.    The  slave clocks  generated by the generator may be used by any number of device-types (i.e.,  "slave clock sinks"),  such as line drivers or switches.<br>
The reference source frequencies shown in FIG. 1 are merely exemplary; the invention is adaptable for use with reference sources having a wide range of frequencies, as long as the local oscillator frequency, as used on-chip (i.e., as   used by those slave clock generator components which may be integrated together on a common substrate, discussed   in   more   detail   below),    is made high enough    to accommodate them.  For cost and complexity reasons (e.g., it must be very well temperature-compensated) , the local oscillator is preferably off-chip, and supplies its clock to the chip at a moderate frequency that is lower than<br><br>
that actually required on-chip.  A clock multiplier 25, preferably  an  on-chip  analog  phase-locked  loop  (PLL) circuit, is then used to multiply up the frequency of the supplied local oscillator clock to obtain a high-speed clock for use on-chip.   To generate a slave clock that closely tracks a reference source using direct digital syntnesis requires a local oscillator having a frequency that  is  greater  than  that of  the  selected reference source; a local oscillator frequency at least 2 times greater  than  that  of  the  highest  frequency  of  the selected reference source is required, and higher ratios are preferred.<br>
A block diagram illustrating the basic components of slave  clock generator  10  is  shown  in  FIG.  2.   The reference  sources  12  are  received  by  a  selection multiplexer  20,  which  selects  one  of  the  reference sources to be the clock Ts from which the slave clocks are derived.   The selection is made under the control of external network management components, which establish a preferred  selection order.   The selection multiplexer preferably also includes the capability to monitor the frequency of each of the reference sources, in which case the multiplexer receives the output of a local oscillator 24 (shown multiplied up with clock multiplier 25 for use on-chip, as   discussed above) as   a reference; if a source is outside of a predetermined range, the source is "de¬selected".  A source is de-selected if the system blocks it from being selected at all,  or if,  after having already been selected, the frequency of the source is detected to have fallen outside the predetermined range. In the latter case,    the selection multiplexer selects   the next source in accordance with the selection order.  The de-selection process is discussed in more detail below.<br>
The selected reference source Ts is fed to a phase generator 22,  which also receives  the  (multiplied up)<br><br><br>
output  of  local  oscillator 24.    The phase generator produces a phase value P  (discussed in detail below), which is a measure of the relative frequency of selected source Ts with respect to the frequency of the local oscillator.   Phase value P is fed to a clock generator 26, which decodes the P value and generates one or more slave clocks 16 in accordance with the P value.   The ? value  is  periodically  updated  so  that  it  accurately represents the frequency of the selected source Ts; in turn, the frequency of the slave clocks closely tracks tnat of the selected reference source.  A feedback signal 21    is preferably fed back to the selection multiplexer 20, and one of the slave clock outputs 16 is fed back via line 28 to phase generator 22 - the purposes for these feedback signals is. described below.   Multioliers and dividers can be employed as needed to enable a range of slave clocks to be generated from the selected reference source.<br>
A block diagram illustrating an exemplary embodiment of selection multiplexer 20 is shown in FIG. 3. If necessary, the N reference sources 12 are passed through level shifters 30 to ensure that they share common logic levels. The reference sources are then fed to a conventional 1 of N multiplexer 32, which connects one of the reference sources to an output 34 in accordance with a control signal received at a control input 36.<br>
The determination of which reference source to select must take into account the operational availability of each source, as well as a number of factors that are external to the invention - such as the wishes of the network planners and the topology of the network. These external factors are preferably accommodated via the loading of a configuration table 38 with a preferred order of priority for selecting the incoming  sources.    The  selection  order  priority  is<br><br>
preferably loaded into table 38 from an external microprocessor (not shown) via a port 40. The configuration  table produces an output to a multiplexer control circuit 41, which conveys the reference source selection to multiplexer 32 via control input 36.<br>
The  operational  availability  of  each  of  the  N sources  is  preferably monitored by respective toggle detectors 42.  The N toggle detectors are each supplied with a clock derived from the local oscillator, which they use to determine the frequency of their respective reference sources.  Each of the toggle detectors monitors its respective source to determine whether its frequency is within a specified range, as well as for intermittent behavior.   The toggle detectors report reference source status to multiplexer control circuit 41.  Any reference source that does not meet the required standards  is blocked from selection.  If an out-of-tolerance reference source is currently selected, multiplexer control circuit 41 automatically selects a different source in accordance with  the  configuration  table,  and blocks  the  failed source from being reselected.   In this way,  the best reference  source  (as  determined by  the predetermined priority order and the sources' operational availability) is always selected.   The status of each source, may be stored in a register which is readable by the external microprocessor.  The output 34 of multiplexer 32 may be fed  to  a  clock multiplier  circuit  44,  preferably  a digital PLL,  which produces clock Ts from which slave clocks will be generated.   The multiplier circuit is useful to ensure that Ts always oscillates at the same nominal  frequency,  regardless of the frequency of the selected  reference source.   Clock multiplier  44  also preferably  receives  feedback  signal  27  from  clock generator 26, the purpose of which is described below.<br>
The  slave clock generator uses  a direct  digital<br><br>
synthesis technique to generate the slave clocks; this technique involves the use of phase and clock generators as discussed  below.   A block diagram illustrating an exemplary embodiment of phase generator 22 is shown in FIG.  4.    The  local  oscillator 24  (multiplied up as necessary) is used to establish a short-term measurement period and a long-term measurement period,  preferably using a pair of counters 50 and 52, respectively, which are  arranged  to  divide  down  the  local  oscillator frequency by respective amounts to produce the desired short and long-term measurement periods.  If necessary to provide  accurate  measurement  periods,   the   local oscillator  frequency  can  be  multiplied  with  clock multiplier 54 - implemented with an analog PLL circuit, for example - prior to its being divided down.  Though the measurement periods are implemented with a pair of counters in FIG. 4, the invention is not limited to this implementation.  Other means by which a well-known and repeatable measurement period can be generated may also be employed.<br>
The selected reference clock Ts is fed to a short-term counter 56, which is arranged to count the cycles of clock Ts that occur during the short-term measurement period.  This technique measures the relative frequency of the selected clock with respect to that of the local oscillator.  An absolute measurement of the frequency of selected clock Ts  is  not  required because  the  local oscillator is used again in the generation of the slave clock, so that any permanent offsets in the frequency of the local oscillator are canceled out.   The number of cycles counted by short-term counter 56 during a short-term measurement period is output as a value D.  Short-term  measurement  periods  are  generated  periodically (i.e., one right after another at fixed intervals), so that  the D value is periodically updated so that  it<br><br>
always reflects the recent history of clock Ts.<br>
The duration of the short-term measurement period is application-dependent, selected to enable effective tracking of the selected clock's jitter and wander components. For example, a short-term measurement period of 50ms permits the circuit to track wander components of up to 20Hz, while a measurement period of 500ms enables the tracking of wander frequencies below 2Hz. The flexibility hereby afforded permits the circuit to be used in a wide range of applications.<br>
In between updates of the D value, the present D vaiue is used to generate a phase-base by continually adding the D value to an accumulated phase value P, at a rate of one addition for every cycle of the local oscil.'ator; this is accomplished with a phase accumulator 57. The ongoing phase value P is a piecewise-linear approximation of a linear phase increase. The P value is decoded by clock generator 26 to produce the slave clock.<br>
Inaccuracies in the slave clock can be caused by "rounding errors' in the D count.   Rounding errors are inevitable when two clock domains are involved, because there is always the possibility that metastability will occur which affects the incrementing of the count at the end of the measurement period.   A special handshaking technique can be employed to prevent such metastability from affecting the beginning of the measurement period, but handshaking can only improve the operation at one end or the other of the measurement period - not at both ends.   Rounding errors can cause the D count to be in error by several parts per million, resulting in a slave clock frequency offset of the same order.   This can be several orders of magnitude greater than that required by the applicable standards (which can be as low as 3 parts per billion).<br>
Inaccuracies  in  the slave clock due  to  rounding<br><br>
errors are combated by detecting differences between the selected clock and one of the generated slave clocks using two additional counters 58 and 60, which operate over a longer time period so that the impact of rounding errors is diminished to an  acceptable level.  As shown in FIG.  4,  long-term counters 58 and 60 are arranged to count the cycles of selected clock Ts and of a generated slave clock, respectively, which occur during the long-term  measurement  period  established  by  the  local oscillator.  The number of cycles counted by long-term counters 58 and 60 during a long-term measurement period are output as  a   value B and a value C, respectively.  The slave clock generator is typically configured to provide a number of sleve clocks having a variety of frequencies; as   such, the slave clock 28 which is fed to counter 60   is preferably one that is at the same frequency as Ts, to simplify the comparison between the B and C values.<br>
The duration of the long-term measurement period is also application-dependent, chosen so that the effect of any rounding errors in the long-term counts are not so great as to permit the slave clock frequency to be pushed outside of its specified limits. The handshaking technique mentioned above can also be employed to improve the accuracy of these counts, as well as to reduce the Length of the long-term measurement period.<br>
Cycle count values B and C are fed to a correction value  accumulator  62,  which  computes  the  difference between them (B-C).   This difference value serves as a correction vector, which is fed to the phase accumulator  7 to correct for errors in the D value.  Because the B nd C values are much larger than the D value (due to the such longer measurement period) , the difference value is referably scaled down with a scaler 64 to suit the ensitivity of  the phase accumulator;  the  output  of caler 64 is a value K, which is given by (B-C) divided<br><br>
by a  scaling  factor established by scaler 64.   The scaling factor is selected to serve two primary purposes: it shifts the -B-C   result down until the most-significant bits of the result carry the same weight as    the most-significant bits of the D value, and it bleeds the lower-significance bits into the accumulator in a smooth way. Because there is a long-term measurement period between updates of the difference value,  the error which it corrects may be present in the generated slave clock for  several  seconds.    However,  the  governing  standards typically permit this brief period of error.<br>
The  operation  of  the  phase  accumulator  is illustrated in FIG. 5, which plots phase value P over time.  Phase accumulator 57 keeps an ongoing total of D and K values, repetitively adding the current D and K values to the current total of all the previous D and K values  until  "roll-over"  occurs;   i.e.,  when  the cumulative total exceeds a maximum value Pmax.   The P value is updated once per cycle of the local oscillator, the waveform of which is shown below the graph.   As a result,  P increases in a stair-step fashion, with each step being equal to its respective D+K value.   P takes the form of a binary value; in this example, the clock generator is arranged to toggle the slave clock (shown below the graph) when the most-significant-bit (MSB) of the P value changes state, and when the P value exceeds<br>
Referring back to FIG. 4, an ongoing P total is maintained by connecting phase accumulator 57 to a roll¬over accumulator 70. Roll-over accumulator 70 receives the current P value at one input and the PMV value at a second input, and produces an output P' which is fed to an input of phase accumulator 57. When P is less than Pmax, roll-over accumulator 70 sets P'=P. However, when the  P  value  exceeds  Pmax,  roll-over  accumulator  70<br><br>
subtracts P from Pmax. to determine a "remainder" value, and P' is set equal to this remainder.<br>
Phase accumulator 57 is arranged to produce a phase value P that is given by: P = P' + D + K, where K is given by: K = (B-C)/scaling factor,<br>
wnere the scaling factor is established by scaler 64 as discussed above. When the remainder value is summed into phase accumulator 57 as described above, it is used as the starting value of the next cycle.<br>
The P value produced by phase accumulator 57 is fed to clock generator 26, an exemplary embodiment of which is shown in FIG. 6.  P is decoded with a phase-to-clock converter 80, which produces a decoded slave clock output waveform 81 having a frequency that varies with phase value P.   There are many possible implementations of phase-to-clock converter 80, two of which are shown in FIGs. 7a and 7b.  In FIG. 7a, the P value is applied to a look-up   table   82,   which   outputs   digital   words corresponding to portions of a sinewave in response to the changing P value.  The look-up table output is fed to a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter 84 to produce a clock waveform, which is passed   through a bandpass filter 86   to improve the quality of the clock waveform.<br>
Another possible phase-to-clock converter 80 is shown in FIG. 7b, consisting of a single AND gate 88. In this example, the AND gate is connected to the MSB of the P value, and to an ENABLE signal. When ENABLE is high and the P value's MSB toggles high, the output of the AND gate - and of the decoded slave clock waveform - also go high. This implementation produces a simple square wave output, which does not require the use of a bandpass filter.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 6,  the output of phase-to-<br><br>
clock converter 80 is preferably fed to an analog PLL circuit 90.  The PLL acts to attenuate any jitter that is present in the decoded slave clock, and can be programmed to multiply or divide the decoded output to produce a slave clock having a  specific  frequency.   Additional slave clock frequencies can be derived from the decoded slave clock output with additional divider circuits, as exemplified by divider 92 in FIG. 6.  Squelch circuits 94 and 96, preferably implemented with AND gates, can be inserted in series with each slave clock output to kill their respective clocks, which can be used to indicate the occurrence of a failure in the clock generation process to downstream equipment.  Level shifters 98 can also be inserted in series with the slave clock outputs, when needed to match the logic levels oi a generated slave clock with those required by the slave clock's sink.<br>
The decoded slave clock serves as    feedback signal 27, which is connected back to the clock multiplier 44 of selection multiplexer 20.      This feedback path is used to allow the clock multiplier to align selected clock Ts with the selected reference source.  This is made possible by requiring all input and output clocks to be multiples of a particular frequency,  such as    8kHz.   Then,  the 8kHz fundamental of clock Ts is aligned with that of the selected   reference   source   clock.   The   short-term measurement  period  (and,  indirectly,   the  long-term measurement period) are then aligned with T3.  One of the slave  clock outputs  28  is also  fed back  from clock generator 26 to phase generator 22, where it is monitored with long-term counter 60.<br>
The slave clock generator is preferably arranged to temporarily enter holdover mode when a different reference source is selected. A state machine, included as part of multiplexer control circuit 41, takes inputs<br><br>
from the toggle detectors, the configuration table 38 and a control register, is accessed for reading and writing via the microprocessor port, and determines the operating mode.   When a selected reference source has to be de¬selected, the state machine causes the holdover mode to be entered until an alternative reference source has been declared available; the state machine then selects the new reference source as Ts, waits for the 8kHz fundamental of the output signal to become aligned to that of the new reference source, and then enters the locked mode.  The holdover mode operates using the history of the measured frequency of the previous selected reference source to continue to generate the slave clock,  without causing errors in the output.  Holdover mode is cleared when the selection of a new reference source is complete. The use of the holdover mode during a switch-over ensures a smooth  transition  from  one  clock  source  to  another. Holdover mode can also be invoked and canceled by the external microprocessor.<br>
The slave clock generator is preferably arranged to enter the free-running mode immediately following power-up, with the state machine within multiplexer control circuit 41 (described above) controlling the mode selection. Direct digital synthesis is used to generate the slave clock, but the clock's frequency is determined by a snored value which is typically calculated and stored during initial system test. Free-running mode can also be invoked and canceled by the external microprocessor.<br>
Because the local oscillator is used to monitor the reference source and slave clocks, and to generate the slave clocks, drifts in the frequency of the local oscillator do not affect the long-term accuracy of the slave clock frequency during locked mode. Drifts in the frequency of the local oscillator during free-running and<br><br>
holdover modes, however, do affect the accuracy of the slave clock frequency. Local oscillators with good temperature compensation and low aging coefficients, such as might be provided by a temperature-compensated crystal oscillator, are preferred. A local oscillator which can be integrated onto the same semiconductor substrate as the rest of the slave clock generator is preferred if a higher level of integration is desired.<br>
A more  flexible  implementation of a  slave clock generator per the present invention is shown in the block diagram of FIG. 8.  Before, each slave clock output was derived from Ts, with the decoded slave clock multiplied or divided as necessary.  Here, one or more slave clocks can be derived from one of the reference sources 12.  A selection multiplexer. 110 (SE.ECTION MUX 2) receives two or more reference sources.  Multiplexer 110 is directed to select one of the reference sources, preferably under the control  of an external microprocessor,  which  is passed on to its output  112.   A divider 114 may be provided in series with the multiplexer output if a lower frequency slave clock is needed.  A selection multiplexer 116 (SELECTION MUX 3) receives the output of multiplexer 112 and a slave clock derived from Ts as inputs, and is directed to select one or the other to be output as a slave clock.<br>
Because the components of slave clock generator 10 are mostly digital circuits (i.e., the generator is all-digital except for the analog PLLs and the off-chip local oscillator), the invention's noise-rejecting and noise-suppressing characteristics are improved when compared with mostly-analog prior art systems such as the VCO design discussed above. Sensitivity to board layout is also reduced, making it much easier to use the generator in practice.<br>
The mostly-digital implementation also enables the<br>
slave clock generator, i.e., everything contained within box  10  in  FIG.  2,  to  be  integrated  onto  a  common substrate,  deriving further benefits in terms of cost reduction and reduced power consumption.  The invention requires  no  local  microprocessor  for  its  operation (though an external microprocessor is typically used to provide network management  functions).   All  of these advantages  combine  to  make  the  present  invention eminently  suitable  for  use  in  a  modern  synchronous telecommunications network.<br>
