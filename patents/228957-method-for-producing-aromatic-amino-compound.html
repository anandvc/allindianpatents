DESCRIPTION METHOD FOR PRODUCING AROMATIC AMINO COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for producing an aromatic amino compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for producing an aromatic amino compound useful as the charge transporting material in the fields of the electronic photosensitive materials and the organic electroluminescence devices without using highly toxic raw materials.<br>

Application of aromatic amino compounds to the electronics field as functional material has been studied and the aromatic amino compounds are widely used as the charge transporting material in the fields of the electronic photosensitive materials and the organic electroluminescence devices. As the method for synthesizing the aromatic amino compounds, the Ullmann reaction is widely known. In accordance with the UUmann reaction, an amino compound and an aromatic halogen compound are mixed together under stirring in the presence of a metal catalyst at a high temperature. This reaction has a drawback in that the yield is small. For example, the Ullmann reaction using aromatic amines is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 8-48656 but the yield of the reaction is as small as 10 to 20%.<br>
For synthesis of an aromatic amino compound,  heretofore,  the<br><br>
reaction routes using a-naphthylamine, p-naphthylamine, 4-aminodiphenyl or benzidine are known but these compounds exhibits strong toxicity.

Example 1<br>
Di-4-biphenylylamine   and   N,N,N',N'-tetra(4"biphenylyl)benzidine were prepared in accordance with the following reaction routes, (l)      N,N-Di(4-biphenylyl)benzylamine   was   prepared.      The   reaction<br><br>
scheme is shown in the following"<br><br>
Into a 100 ml three-necked flask, 10.0 g (42.9 mmol, 2.3 eq) of 4-bromobiphenyl, 4.32 g (44.9 mmol, 2.4 eq) of sodium t-butoxide and 42,0 mg (0.187 mmol, 1.0% by mole) of palladium acetate were placed. A stirrer rod having the shape of a rugby ball was placed into the flask. A rubber cap was placed at each of two openings at the sides of the flask. A coiled tube condenser for refluxing was attached to the central opening of the flask and a three-way stopcock attached with a balloon containing the argon gas was attached to the top of the coiled tube condenser. The atmosphere in the system was purged with the argon gas in the balloon 3 times using a vacuum pump.<br>
To the above system, 60 ml of dehydrated toluene, 2.04 ml (18.7 mmol) of benzylamine and 169 μl (0.374 mmol, 2.0% by mole) of a 2.22 moles/liter toluene solution of tris-t-butylphosphine were added using a syringe through a rubber septum and the resultant mixture was stirred at the room temperature for 5 minutes. Then, the flask was set into an oil bath and the temperature was raised slowly to 120C while the solution was stirred. After 7 and a half hours, the flask was removed from the oil bath to stop the reaction and left standing for one night under the atmosphere of argon.<br><br>
The reaction mixture was transferred to a separation funnel. Dichloromethane in an amount of 300 ml was added and precipitates were dissolved. After washing with 60 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, the organic layer was dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate. After potassium carbonate was removed by filtration, the organic solvent was removed by distillation from the organic layer. To the obtained residue, 200 ml of toluene and 40 ml of ethanol were added and the residue was completely dissolved by heating at 80°C with attachment of a drying tube. The resultant solution was slowly cooled to the room temperature by being left standing for one night and the recrystallization was conducted. The formed crystals were separated by filtration using a Kiriyama funnel. After drying the crystals at 60°C in vacuo, 6.73 g (16.4 mmol) of N,N-di(4-biphenylyl)benzylamine was obtained at a yield of 87%.<br>
The results of the measurements of NMR and FD-MASS on the obtained N,N-di(4-biphenylyl)benzylamine were as follows:<br>
NMR:   SgoMHz 5.07 (2H, s), 7.1 to 7.7 (23H, m)<br>
FD-MASS:   411 (2)   Di-4-biphenylylamine was prepared.   The reaction scheme is shown in the following<br><br>
Into a 300 ml single-necked flask, 1.35 g (3.28 mmol) of N,N-di(4-biphenyi)benzylamine obtained in (l) and 135 mg (10% by weight) of palladium-active carbon (the content of palladium: 10% by weight) were placed.   To the resultant mixture, 100 ml of chloroform and 20 ml of<br><br>
ethanol were added and the substrate was dissolved. A stirrer rod having the shape of a rugby ball was placed into the flask. A three-way stopcock attached with a balloon (a gas bag) containing 2 liters of the hydrogen gas was attached to the flask and the inside of the flask system was purged with the hydrogen gas 3 times using a vacuum pump. The hydrogen gas in the decreased amount was replenished and the volume of the hydrogen gas was adjusted at 2 liters. The resultant fluid was vigorously stirred at the room temperature. After the fluid was stirred for the total time of 30 hours at the room temperature, 100 ml of dichloromethane was added and the catalyst was removed by filtration. The obtained solution was transferred to a separation funnel and washed with 50 ml of a saturated solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate. The organic layer was separated, dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered and the solvent was removed by distillation. To the obtained residue, 50 ml of toluene was added and the recrystallization was conducted. The formed crystals were separated using a Kiriyama funnel and dried in vacuo at 50° C and 990 mg (3.08 mmol) of di-4-biphenylyl- amine was obtained at a yield of 94%.<br>
The results of the measurements of NMR and FD-MASS on the obtained di-4-biphenylylamine were as follows'<br>
NMR:   S90MHz 5.83 (IH, bs), 7.0 to 7.8 (18H, m)<br>
FD-MASS:   321<br><br><br><br>
Into a 50 ml two-necked flask, 500 mg (1.56 mmol, 2.1 eq) of di-4-biphenylylamine obtained in (2), 231 mg (0.741 mmol) of 4,4'-dibromobiphenyl, 3.4 mg (0.0148 mmol, 2.0% by mole) of palladium acetate and 157 mg (1.63 mmol, 2.2 eq) of sodium t-butoxide were placed. A rubber cap was placed at the side opening of the flask. A coiled tube condenser for refluxing was attached to the central opening of the flask and a three-way stopcock attached with a balloon containing the argon gas was attached to the top of the coiled tube condenser. The atmosphere in the system was purged with the argon gas in the balloon 3 times using a vacuum pump.<br>
To the above system, 10 ml of dehydrated toluene and 13,4 |.d (0.0296 mmol, 4.0% by mole) of a 2.22 moles/liter toluene solution of tris-t-butylphosphine were added using a syringe through a rubber septum. Then, the flask was set into an oil bath and the temperature was raised slowly to 115°C while the solution was stirred. After heating at 115°C for 6 hours under stirring, the flask was removed from the oil bath and left standing at the room temperature for one night.<br>
The formed precipitates were completely dissolved in 500 ml of dichloromethane. After the resultant solution was transferred to a separation funnel and washed with 100 ml of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, the organic layer (yellow) was dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration, the organic solvent was removed by distillation and 150 ml of toluene and 50 ml of ethanpl were added to the<br><br>
obtained residue. After a drying tube was attached, the precipitates were dissolved to some degree by heating at 80°C and the resultant mixture was slowly cooled to the room temperature. The crystals in the system were separated by filtration using a Kiriyama funnel. After the crystals were washed with small amounts of toluene and ethanol and dried at 60°C for 3 hours in a vacuum drying chamber, 453 mg (0.571 mmol) of N,N,N'.N'" tetra(4-biphenylyl)benzidine was obtained at a yield of 77%.<br>

A coiled tube condenser for refluxing was attached to the central opening of the flask and a three-way stopcock attached with a balloon containing the argon gas was attached to the top of the coiled tube condenser. The atmosphere in the system was purged with the argon gas in the balloon 3 times using a vacuum pump.<br>
To the above system, 60 ml of dehydrated toluene and 2,04 ml (18.7 mmol) of benzylamine were added using a syringe through a rubber septum and the resultant mixture was stirred at the room temperature for 5 minutes.
