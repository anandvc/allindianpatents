				<td>Technical field:<br>
The present invention in general, relates to a fuel injection device for an automobile and in particular, relates to a fuel injection device provided with a high-pressure accumulator body having an integrated distributor block. Background:<br>
DEI 0060785 AI relates to a fuel injection device with a fuel high-pressure accumulator. Such a fuel high-pressure accumulator is provided with branch pipes that are capable of being screwed and each of which contains a throttle for reduction of pressure pulsations in the fuel injection device. Each throttle is designed as a tube piece, which is arranged at one end of the branch pipe, at which a connection head is attached, or arranged in the interior of the branch pipe near each end. Throttle elements in high-pressure accumulators such as common rail, attend to the pressure wave damping within the high-pressure accumulator body. In addition, e.g.cylindrical throttle pieces are press-fitted in connecting bores of the common rail, which lead to the individual fuel injectors or also to the high-pressure pump impinging on the high-pressure accumulator. The press-fitted throttle elements in the connecting bores help in the enhancement of damping of pressure fluctuations within the fuel injection system and thereby enable an increase in the pressure-resistance of the individual components.<br>
DE202004019820.7 relates to a fuel injection device for a diesel engine. A fuel injection device has a fuel high-pressure accumulator and several branch pipes used for fuel discharge from the fuel high-pressure accumulator. Each of these pipes has at one end a connection head for connecting the branch pipe with an assigned connector branch of the fuel high-pressure accumulator, wherein in each of the branch pipes a throttle is attached. The throttle is embodied in a support element, which is fixed in the area of the connecting head by means of fixing elements, which are embodied with the design of the connecting head and constrict an internal width of the branch pipe on both sides of the support element. The throttle is in the support element as a connecting passage with a first partial bore and a second partial bore, i.e. embodied in two stages. The connecting passage is ensured during the heading of the connecting head by means of an inserted, stepped, cylindrical internal spike, which is designed recyclable. The support element has preferably a cylindrical lateral surface.<br>
For internal combustion engines with six and more cylinders, two high-pressure accumulators are used, which provide the fuel injectors with fuel. The two<br>
high-pressure accumulators (common rail) are connected to each other by a connecting line, which takes care of pressure compensation between the high-pressure accumulators. For damping of pressure fluctuations, which occur in both the high-pressure accumulators, a distributor block can be installed additionally. The distributor block is pressurised via a pressure pump, which compresses the fuel to the system pressure and maintains the said system pressure in both the high-pressure accumulators. Both high-pressure accumulators are provided with fuel by the distributor block pressurised by the high-pressure pump. The oscillations are damped in the distributor block. Summary:<br>
The present subject matter as disclosed herein, describes a fuel injection system for a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine. The fuel injection system has a first high-pressure accumulator, a second high-pressure accumulator, and a high-pressure pump. The first and the second high-pressure accumulators have plurality of ports corresponding to the number of cylinders of the internal combustion engine for injector supply lines. A damping volume for damping of pressure pulsations between the high-pressure accumulators and for damping between the high-pressure accumulators and the high-pressure pump is integrated into one of the high-pressure accumulators.<br>

The present subject matter describes a distributor block that is integrated into one of the two high-pressure accumulators instead of the distributor block of the prior art that is designed as separate component. The integrated distributor provides fuel to the multi-cylinder internal combustion engine. This is preferably achieved by integrating a throttle in a cavity of the respective high-pressure accumulator (common rail). Through the integration of the throttle in the cavity designed as a bore of the concerned high-pressure accumulator, the volume of the high-pressure accumulator is divided into two individual volume units. The smaller of the two individual volume units of the concerned high-pressure accumulator (common rail) fulfils the function of the distributor block hitherto produced as a separate component. The smaller volume unit of the concerned high-pressure accumulator representing the distributor block is present preferably at the end of the high-pressure accumulator, to which the high<br>
pressure pumps are connected, which provide fuel to the respective high-pressure accumulator branching off from the high-pressure pump. The other high-pressure accumulator is provided with fuel by the said high-pressure accumulator in which the distributor block is integrated, via a connecting line at whose opening aperture a damping throttle is integrated in the further high-pressure accumulator.<br>
The present subject matter one one hand provides a separate component demanding the incorporation of a combustion chamber between the two high-pressure accumulators is avoided. This ensures that the installation space of the proposed fuel injection system turns out to be lesser in the cylinder head region of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine. Moreover, by avoiding a separate pressure-resistant component to be designed, a significant cost advantage is obtained. As proposed according to the present invention, the distributor block integrated in one of the high-pressure accumulators also dampens oscillations, which can occur in the fuel injection system and is therefore equivalent to a distributor block hitherto produced as separate components with respect to its function.<br>
For achieving the integrated throttle and thereby effected subdivision of the high-pressure accumulator volume into two separate volume units, several embodiment variants are available:<br>
The integrated throttle can be embodied e.g. as a bore in a diameter strut of the high-pressure accumulator (common rail). According to the said embodiment variant, the cavity is delimited by a deep-hole bore provided on both sides of the tube-shaped high-pressure accumulator. In the strut separating the two deep-hole bore sections an integrated throttle having a stepped throttle channel can be provided. In further development of the said embodiment variant, mutually facing end regions of deep-hole bores provided on both sides of the high-pressure accumulator can also be rounded, to improve the flow properties of the fuel within the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator. In a further embodiment variant, a continuous cavity, which can be designed e.g. as connecting passage in the high-pressure ciccumulator body, a sleeve-shaped component can be introduced, which at one end, preferably at the end facing the central region of the high-pressure accumulator has a throttle opening in a bottom area. The said sleeve-shaped insertion can be fixed in the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator through a connecting piece to which the pressure line from the high-pressure pump is connected. In further development of the said embodiment variant, the port pressurised by the high-pressure pump and the sleeve introduced in<br>
the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator can be produced with throttle bore at the end, also as built-in part, which can be fixed in this by means of e.g. a biting edge at a front face of the high-pressure accumulator.<br>
In a further embodiment variant of the integrated throttle according to the present invention, the said throttle can be integrated in the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator as press-in throttle also comprising a ring element and a throttle body. According to the said embodiment variant, the integrated throttle can be configured as single part component and also as multi-part component comprising a ring body and a throttle body. Instead of a press-in throttle, which is press-fitted in the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator, the integrated throttle can also be designed as a clamped throttle, which is fixed by means of a clamping collar in the cavity of the concerned high-pressure accumulator (Common rail). According to the said embodiment variant, the position of the integrated throttle can be selected as desired within the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator, so that the two separate volume units can also be freely selected within the high-pressure accumulator and can be freely predetermined<br>
In a further embodiment variant, the integrated throttle can also be designed as a two-part component comprising a screw part and a thread part, wherein the thread part as well as the screw part are supported at a diameter step at the inner wall of the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator and are screwed to one another. By means of the screwing, the integrated throttle is integrated in the cavity of the concerned high-pressure accumulator (common rail).<br>
A fuel injection system known from the prior art for multi-cylinder internal combust engines can be obtained from the embodiment according to Figure 1, in which the distributor block is embodied as a separate component.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a fuel injection system of the prior art with a distributor block, which is produced as a separate component. The fuel injection system 10 comprises a high-pressure pump 12, which by means of fuel pressurises a distributor block 14 designed as a separate component. The pipes, which extend from the high-pressure pump 12 to the distributor block 14, each has distributor block throttles 16, via which a damping of the pressure pulsations occurs in the fuel injection system 10. Via the distributor block 14, a first high-pressure accumulator 18 (Common rail) and a second high-pressure accumulator 20 (Common rail) is provided with fuel under system pressure. The system pressure, which prevails in the first high-pressure accumulator 18 and the second high-pressure accumulator 20, depends on the design<br>
of the high-pressure pump 12. A rail pressure sensor 22 is assigned to the first high-pressure accumulator 18, and a pressure regulating valve 24 is assigned to the second high-pressure accumulator 20. The first high-pressure accumulator 18 is pressurised by the distributor block 14 via a pressure line, at whose end a damper throttle 26 is embodied at the entrance of the high-pressure accumulator 18.<br>
Each of the two high-pressure accumulators 18 and 20 respectively comprises four injector supply lines 28, in each of which a feed throttle 30 can be integrated, to dampen the pressure pulsations between the fuel injectors not shown in Figure 1 and the respective high-pressure accumulators 18 and 20 respectively. In the embodiment variant of the fuel injection system 10 shown in Figure 1, via the two high-pressure accumulators 18 and 20 four fuel injectors are provided with fuel under system pressure, the respective cylinders of two cylinder banks are assigned to a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine.<br>
The proposed fuel injection system 10 according to the present invention can be inferred from the illustration according to Figure 2.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the fuel injection system in accordance with one aspect of this invention wherein the distributor block is integrated in one of the high-pressure accumulators (common rail). The fuel injection system 10 has a high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block. For this purpose, the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block is designed longer in comparison with the second high-pressure accumulator 20. Both high-pressure accumulators 20 and 40 respectively are designed basically tube shaped. The rail pressure sensor 22 is assigned to the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, and to the second high-pressure accumulator 20 the pressure regulating valve 24 is assigned. To each of the high-pressure accumulators 20, 40 four injector supply lines 28 are assigned, in each of which a feed throttle 30 is incorporated. With the fuel injection system 10 illustrated in Figure 2 the cylinders of two cylinder banks of an 8-cylinder internal combustion engine can thus be provided with fuel under system pressure. The fuel injection system 10 according to the illustration in Figure 2 can be obviously modified such that a six cylinder engine designed in a V-shape can be equipped with it. Instead of the embodiment variant of the fuel injection system 10 for 8-cylinder internal combustion engines illustrated in Figure 2, internal combustion engines with the fuel injection system proposed according to the present invention, which have a higher cylinder number, can also be equipped.<br>
Unlike the first high-pressure accumulator 18 according to the illustration in Figure 1, the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block has an integrated throttle 42, so that its total volume is subdivided into a first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 and a second high-pressure accumulator unit 46. The first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 is dimensioned larger than the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46, which serves as integrated distributor block within the high-pressure accumulator 40. The second high-pressure accumulator unit 46, i.e. the distributor block integrated in the high-pressure accumulator 40 is preferably at the end at which the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block is pressurised with fuel under high-pressure via pressure lines 48 from the high-pressure pump 12. In each of the supply lines 48 between the high-pressure pump 12 and the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 there are pressure line throttles 50, 52, which dampen the pressure pulsations between the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block and the high-pressure pump 12.<br>
The second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 in the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block remains connected with the second high-pressure accumulator 20 via a connecting line containing a damping throttle 26, the second high-pressure accumulator 20 is designed identical to the second high-pressure accumulator 20 as illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
By means of the fuel injection system 10 according to the present invention illustrated in Figure 2, the distributor block 14 illustrated in Figure 1 as a separate component is economised, so that in the cylinder head region of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine with two cylinder banks resulting in a lesser space requirement for the proposed fuel injection system 10 according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3.1 illustrates an embodiment variant provided as connecting passage of the integrated throttle can be obtained<br>
Figure 3.1 depicts that the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block has a cavity 54. The cavity 54 is determined by means of a section of deep hole bore 56 provided at both sides in the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block . Within the remaining webs in the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, an integrated throttle 42 is embodied which can be designed as connecting passage 62. The second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 within the cavity 54 developed through a section of the deep-hole<br>
bore 56 is delimited on one side by the integrated throttle 42 and on the other side by a port 64, to which the high-pressure pump 12 is connected. In the port 64 for the high-pressure pump 12, an integrated damper throttle 66 can be designed. The port of the injector supply lines is marked with the reference mark 60 in the embodiment variant illustrated in Figure 3.1, wherein in the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, press-in throttles 58 are introduced. By means of the press-in throttle 48, pressure pulsations between the fuel injectors not shown in Figure 3.1 and the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block are damped.<br>
The illustration according to Figure 3.2 shows an embodiment variant of the integrated throttle shown in Figure 3.1. In accordance with the illustration in Figure 3.2, the integrated throttle 42 is likewise embodied as a through bore throttle 62 with a stepped throttle channel, however, the front faces facing each other of both boring sections of the deep-hole bore 56 in the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block are rounded 70, which benefits the resistance properties of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, since notch effect is avoided. The cavity 54 and the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 are directly provided with fuel at high-pressure via the high-pressure pump 12 acting at the port 64 via the pressure line 48. Also in the embodiment variant of the proposed fuel injection system 10 according to the invention illustrated in Figure 3.2, press-in throttles 58 are introduced in the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, which dampen the pressure pulsations between the cavity 54 and injector supply lines 28 to the fuel injectors of the multi-cylinder internal combustion engine connected to the ports 60. By means of the rounding's 70 a steady flow configuration through the integrated throttle 42 designed as through bore throttle channel 62 which separates the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 from the first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 within the cavity 54.<br>
Figure 4.1 illustrates an integrated throttle with respect to a third embodiment of the present invention wherein a sleeve-shaped body is inserted in the cavity of the high-pressure accumulator.<br>
Figure 4.1 shows that the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block is subdivided into first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 and the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 by a sleeve 72. which has a bottom area with throttle bore. The sleeve 72 comprises a bottom area, in which the<br>
integrated throttle 42 is configured as a bore that can be easily produced. The sleeve 72 is fixed via the port 64 for the pressure line 48 of the high-pressure pump 64 in the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block. For this, the port 64 for the pressure line 48 of the high-pressure pump 12 has a biting edge 64, which is fixed in the damping volume 46 in the connecting area non-positively or positively (force fitted or form fitted) and acts on sleeve 72 with integrated throttle 42 introduced in the cavity 54. In the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block the aforementioned press-in throttles 48 are present below the ports 60, at which the injector supply lines 28 are present to which fuel injectors to he provided with fuel at system pressure are connected.<br>
Figure 4.2 shows an embodiment variant of the configuration shown in Figure 4.1.<br>
The illustration according to Figure 4.2 shows that the components shown in Figure 4.1, namely the sleeve 72 and the port 64 for the pressure line 48 of the high-pressure pump can be configured as a common one piece insert 78. The said insert 78 comprises the port for the pressure line 48 of the high-pressure pump 12 as well as the sleeve. At the end facing the cavity 54, the one- piece insert 78 has a bottom area, in which the integrated throttle 42 is designed likewise as simple bore. Through the insert 78, the first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 and the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 are shown in the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block. In contrast to the embodiment variant illustrated in Figure 4.1, no press-in throttles 58 are designed in the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, the damping throttles 30 are achieved as simple bores in the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block and are present below the ports 60 for the injector supply lines 38.<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment variant for an integrated throttle designed as press-in throttle.<br>
In the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, the integrated throttle 42 configured as press-fitted throttle 80 separates the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 from the first high-pressure accumulator unit 44. Through the press-in location, that is, the axial length of the cavity 54, at which the integrated throttle 42 configured as press-fitted throttle 80 is fixed, the dimensions of the first high-pressure accumulator volume unit 44 and the dimensions of the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 in the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40<br>
with integrated distributor block can be accurately predetermined. The embodiment variant of the press-fitted throttle 80 illustrated in Figure 5 has a ring body 82 and a throttle body 84. The ring body 82 abuts an inner wall, which delimits the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block. In the wall 68 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, the damping throttles 30 are again configured as simple bores, which run vertical to the cavity 54 under the ports 60 for the injector supply lines 28.<br>
Figure 5.1 shows an embodiment variant of an integrated throttle designed as press-in throttle according to Figure 5.<br>
The illustration according to Figure 5.1 shows that at an inner wall 94 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block, a diameter step 86 is configured, at which a flange of the throttle body 84 is supported. The throttle body 84 is traversed by a throttle channel 88 with a diameter step and separates the first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 from the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46. The flange, which is designed at the throttle body 84 is assigned to the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 within the cavity 54 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block.<br>
Figure 5.2 shows an embodiment variant of the integrated throttle, which can be fixed using a clamping collar in the high-pressure accumulator with integrated distributor block.<br>
The illustration according to Figure 5.2 shows that a clamped throttle 92 is fixed via a clamping collar 90 to the wall 68 an the inner wall 94 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block . According to the embodiment variant illustrated in Figure 5.2 , the installation location of the integrated throttle 42 in the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block is freely selected corresponding to the partitioning of the high-pressure accumulator units 44 and 46 . Also the clamped throttle 92 has a throttle channel 88 with diameter step.<br>
Figure 5.3 illustrates an integrated throttle in two parts comprising a thread part and a screw part.<br>
Figure 5.3 shows that the integrated throttle 42 is configured as screwed-in throttle 96 and has a screw part 98 and a thread part 100. The thread part 100 and the screw part 98 abut at a diameter step 86, which is designed at the inner wall 94 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block. The thread part 100 and the screw part 98 each has a tool collar (tool shoulder) 102, via which the screw<br>
part 98 and the thread part 100 are screwed, till their respective front faces abut at the diameter step 86 of the inner wall 96 of the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block and there screwed against each other with defined torque. The screw part 98 has the already stated throttle channel 88 with diameter step. Via the embodiment variants of the integrated throttle 42 shown in Figure 5, Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3, the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block can be split likewise into a first high-pressure accumulator unit 44 and a second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 shown in Figure 2, wherein the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 functions as integrated distributor block, in which pressure pulsations in the fuel under system pressure are damped. The second high-pressure accumulator unit 46, which forms the integrated distributor block remains in contact with the second high-pressure accumulator 20 in an advantageous manner via a connecting line with damping throttle 26, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
During pressure pulsations, which occur during the injection process in the combustion chambers of an internal combustion engine at the fuel injectors, via which the throttles 30 and 58 configured in the injector supply lines 28 are damped, pressure pulsations between the high-pressure pump 12 transmitted through the pressure lines 48 are damped via the second high-pressure accumulator unit 46 in the high-pressure accumulator 40 with integrated distributor block.<br>
Other advantages of the highr pressure accumulator body device will become better understood from the description and claims of an exemplary embodiment of such a unit.<br>
