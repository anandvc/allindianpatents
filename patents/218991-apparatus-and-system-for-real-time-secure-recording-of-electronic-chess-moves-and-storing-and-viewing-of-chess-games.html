SYSTEM AND DEVICES FOR REAL-TIME ELECTRONIC CHESS MOVE<br>
RECORDING. VIEWING AND STORAGE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention concerns a system and devices for reai-time electronic<br>
chess move recording, viewing and storage. It represents hardware andsoftware<br>
system, designed specifically for chess.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
Chess is the most popular board game in the world. The game of chess is played<br>
between two opponents who move their pieces alternately on a square board<br>
called a 'chessboard1. In the course of play each player is required to record his<br>
own moves and those of his opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as<br>
clearly and legibly as possible, in the algebraic notation, on the 'Score sheet'<br>
prescribed for the competition. The score sheets are the property of the organizers<br>
of the event. At the conclusion of the game both players sign both score sheets,<br>
indicating the result of the game. Chess players keep a (paper) copy of their<br>
game.<br>
There are a number of chess tournaments around the world where the above<br>
system is used: The Chess Olympiad; Continental Team Championship; World<br>
Team Championship; National Tournaments; Regional Tournaments; Chess Club<br>
Tournaments; School Tournaments; and other tournaments.<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA2004/000067<br>
2<br>
Chess is promoted by an international organization called FIDE (Federation<br>
Internationale des Echecs) founded in 1924, recognized by the International<br>
Olympic Committee, and having more than 160 member countries.<br>
Global and continental chess tournaments are organized by FIDE, while national<br>
chess federations organize tournaments in their respective countries. Local and<br>
Regional tournaments are organized by chess clubs, regional chess federations,<br>
chess schools or others.<br>
Traditional chess tools are the chess set (pieces and table), chess clock and paper<br>
score sheets. Despite the advent of modern technologies, score sheets<br>
(mandatory in tournaments) are still paper-based, which cause many issues for<br>
tournament chess players and chess tournament organizers.<br>
Chess moves have to be in most cases manually entered into electronic form, in<br>
order to be published, electronically analyzed, and shared with others. At the<br>
conclusion of a typical tournament, the score sheets are gathered by the organizer<br>
and kept in a paper collection as a record of the tournament. Individuals may keep<br>
copies for their own use. There exists no efficient modern database storage of all<br>
worldwide games, and only timely, error-prone, manual entry methods to translate<br>
the games into some other form of media.<br>
Issues related to paper score sheets are the following:<br>
Different languages.<br>
Easily lost score sheets.<br>
Inaccurate or unreadable entries.<br>
Manual entering chess moves into electronic form.<br>
Tournaments cannot be followed in real time.<br>
There is no daily updated database of all games played worldwide.<br>
Exchange of information in chess is difficult, time consuming and costly.<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA2004/000067<br>
3<br>
There presently exist a number of technologies and inventions designed for chess<br>
fans and players:<br>
Tele-chess (on-line and/or Internet chess game between two or more<br>
players);<br>
Pocketsize or commercially available devices which have the capability to<br>
play chess;<br>
Electronic chessboards connected via a wire to a computer for playing<br>
chess with a computer; and<br>
New games or rules on how to play chess.<br>
There are number of patents, which cover computer devices with a capability to<br>
play chess, and on-line or remote game playing methods. For example, see US<br>
Patent No. 6,196,920, US Patent No. 5,738,583, US Patent No. 5,738,583, and<br>
Canadian application no. CA 2372694).<br>
Commercially available "PocketPC" devices cannot be used for chess<br>
tournaments because of the following reasons:<br>
The PocketPC can be manipulated for advantageous help during the chess<br>
tournament, and would be considered as a major threat: memory access, chess<br>
engine, receiving helpful information wirelessly. Master level chess engine can<br>
operate on a small PocketPC device, which could be used in a dishonest manner.<br>
Wireless enabled PocketPCs have too high a cost (min US $ 500).<br>
PocketPCs battery can "die" in 3 to 4 hours when wireless connection is on<br>
(where a chess game can last for 8 hours).<br>
Electronic scoring devices, which exist today, do not resolve chess tournament<br>
management issues. Chess has its rules, which have existed for many years. A<br>
new device needs to be created with chess rules logic, universal chess language,<br>
wireless capabilities, extended power (for example battery) life, miniaturized<br>
electronics, proprietary operating system, worldwide applicability, which is<br>
portable, easy to use and is tamper-free.<br><br><br>
4<br>
There have been attempts to resolve chess tournament management issues with<br>
an electronic chessboard. The electronic chessboard records chess game<br>
automatically. It is heavy (made of wood for example) and has to be physically<br>
wired to the remote computer (over serial or the USB port). It requires to be<br>
plugged into an AC power.<br>
Drawbacks of such system are the following:<br>
Complex to manage due to a large number of cables (remote computers,<br>
power plugs),<br>
Can manage only limited number of games via central computer,<br>
Relatively expensive,<br>
Not mobile, not easily portable,<br>
Not secure information.<br>
There is no commercially available solution, which would effectively resolve<br>
electronic chess move recording, viewing and storage allowing for seamless<br>
creation of a worldwide databank of chess updated in real-time.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide a system and devices for real-time<br>
electronic chess move recording, viewing and storage.<br>

Description of a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
As mentioned above, chess tournament games are currently recorded with pen<br>
and paper. More effective chess game management must provide electronic chess<br>
move recording and storage to simplify chess tournaments and preserve chess<br>
knowledge.<br>
The present invention improves the way that chess tournaments are handled,<br>
recorded and communicated worldwide.<br>
According to the invention, the hand-held, portable apparatus for recording chess<br>
moves, otherwise referred to in the present description as "the electronic chess<br>
manager", resolves the issues of paper score sheets, which are used in chess<br>
tournaments and enables chess players to electronically record, store their games<br>
thus allowing tournaments to be followed real-time on-line.<br>
Some of the electronic chess manager benefits are as follows: it is an easy to use<br>
recording device; portable; loaded with the universal chess language. It<br>
advantageously provides for electronic storage of chess games; lifetime archiving<br>
of games. In a preferred embodiment, no AC power cable is required for operation.<br>
The manager is provided with a secure, wireless data transmission module. The<br>
manager is adapted to have special chess keys (such as time constrain button);<br>
and automatic detection of special conditions (i.e. tie reporting, illegal move). The<br>
.apparatus has a time recording module (spent on each move); and can download<br>
games to a PC though a cable (or wirelessly).<br>
Thus, the electronic chess manager is a hand-held device, which removes the<br>
initial paper and pen-score sheet storage step, and removes the secondary step of<br>
manually re-entering the game into a secondary score sheet. The electronic chess<br>
manager offers the immediate benefit of simplifying data entry, allowing the user to<br>
remain focused and concentrate on his/her game, and not on decoding the move<br><br>
WO 2004/064957		PCT/CA2004/000067<br>
S<br>
and transcribing it onto paper. This action of manual entry requires a shift from the<br>
analytical and logical faculties of the individual, which impedes the focus on the<br>
game.<br>
Also disclosed is a chess tournament management system using electronic chess<br>
managers. The benefits of the chess management system include the fact that it is<br>
an automatic tournament organizer; that it can proceed with the real-time<br>
collection of chess game data; tournaments can be broadcast on Internet in real<br>
time; and it is equipped to automatically calculate ratings. The computer-based<br>
nature of the system provides for quick exchange of chess information, and a large<br>
number of games can be monitored by a single computer.<br>
The chess tournament management system offers benefits for tournament<br>
organizers, in collecting and archiving the data and most importantly, dramatically<br>
saving time and effort in transcribing the chess games onto a database archive.<br>
The value in gathering this information for the first time into a standardized<br>
electronic format on a central database in an efficient manner and data-archiving<br>
this for later review, analysis, printing, is significant. Without the facility of the<br>
electronic chess managers, this would be very difficult. Data correction of any<br>
recording of an illegal move will be performed, as well as immediate flagging of<br>
three cycles of repeated moves, which results in an immediate tie.<br>
With this system professional chess players will be able to analyze their<br>
opponent's recent matches, when preparing for tournaments. Chess fans will be<br>
able to follow worldwide tournaments in real-time.<br>
The present invention allows for more efficient archive management, a dramatic<br>
decrease in magazine editing, and a speedier posting of games on the Internet.<br>
The system represents an automated system where thousands of chess games<br>
and tournaments around the world can be viewed in real-time on the internet or<br>
TV.<br><br>

The components of the present invention will now be described in detail, according<br>
to a preferred embodiment thereof.<br>
Electronic Chess Manager (ECM)-1<br>
The ECM is a portable device capable of recording chess moves automatically or<br>
by intervention of a chess player. ECM has embedded therein, or is programmed<br>
with, chess tournament rules.<br>
The ECM consists of a display 2, which can display characters, numbers chess<br>
pieces and chess board; a processor 3, for data processing; special chess<br>
characters 4, such as time constrain button; a wireless communication interface 5,<br>
for real-time wireless chess game communication; preferably a stylus 6, for touch<br>
screen display usage; a mechanical casing 7; a power module 8, which can be<br>
battery,  solar power, wirelessly powered,  setf-powered  among other power<br>
modules; and a PC interface port 9, which is used for connection to a PC, via<br>
cable. Optionally, the ECM may have an external and internal keyboards and a<br>
camera. One of the important characteristics of the ECM is that it is operable<br>
between a recording mode and at least one other mode, so that only authorized<br>
features are accessible when the ECM is in the recording mode, as will be further<br>
detailed herein. This feature is important in that it is a major distinction between<br>
the present invention and prior art devices, besides the fact that the ECM of the<br>
present invention incorporates chess rules, and interfaces in real-time with a<br>
worldwide database of chess.<br>
Since the ECM is provided with a wireless communication interface, it has the<br>
capability to communicate with a central tournament manager 10 and with<br>
neighboring ECMs.<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA20O4/000067<br>
10<br>
In use, the user enters his/her name and rating via the touch screen display 2<br>
using stylus 6 or any other data entry means. The ECM device automatically<br>
associates a user's personal data with a device serial number, so that the system<br>
could recognize a stolen unit.<br>
The display 2 has a text display section (alphanumeric characters), special chess<br>
characters (time constraint button, draw offer, among others), and chess pieces,<br>
score sheet-like display, chessboard-like display and a table-like display.<br>
The ECM has the capability to transmit chess moves in real-time via wireless<br>
communication interface 5 to a remote computer and download a recorded chess<br>
game to a computer via PC interface port 9.<br>
Tournament data are entered into the ECM manually or automatically sent to the<br>
ECM by a central chess tournament manager 10 at the beginning of the chess<br>
game: Chess Tournament Name, Players Names, Date, Rating ranking, timing<br>
rules and other data.<br>
The Electronic Chess Manager has a capability of recording time spent on each<br>
move. Chess moves are recorded in a universal language. This is accomplished<br>
by using universal, pictorial chess symbols annotation.<br>
The ECM is adapted to report impossible moves, ties after three times repetitive<br>
position, time out, calculate new rating automatically after the game. The ECM<br>
allows a chess player, who comes in a time constraint to press a time constraint<br>
button.<br>
Once the game is initiated (by entering the first move) the unit goes into a game<br>
recording mode. In this mode memory and some functions of ECM are disabled,<br>
for security reasons. The ECM cannot be tampered with to give an unfair<br>
advantage to a chess player. In the recording mode, the unit can only record the<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA2004/000067<br>
11<br>
chess moves. ECM, while in recording mode, cannot access the memory storage<br>
of games, any program that could help a chess player in making his decision on a<br>
next move, nor to receive advantageous information due to its networking<br>
capability.<br>
Once the game is over (accomplished by entering results 1:0, 0:1, or 1/2), the<br>
player can initiate game view mode, and the game can be shown and viewed on<br>
the chessboard-like screen. This feature can be used in schools for training,<br>
tournament preparation by browsing through the chess games and theory. It can<br>
be used by tournament viewers, who wish to follow tournaments in real-time in a<br>
room adjacent to the one where the game is being played.<br>
While in game view mode, ECMs can receive a text message wirelessly, which<br>
may be a commentary from a chess grandmaster, marketing messages or others.<br>
The ECM can further be provided with a built-in chess clock 220 can be integrated<br>
in or connected to an electronic chessboard 200, which automatically sends<br>
information on chess moves to the attached ECM, and chess specific buttons 230.<br>
This represents an all-in-one automatic chess game system.<br>
Chess Tournament Management System<br>
The chess tournament management system consists of;<br>
A Central tournament manager 10, for central chess game collection which<br>
may be connected to the Internet 30;<br>
A Wireless Network 20 of electronic chess managers;<br>
A Plurality of Master 40 and Slave 50 ECMs, which transmit chess game<br>
information or are in a standby mode;<br>
A Central computer local to a tournament 60;<br>
At least one remote computer 70 for real-time tournament viewing;<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA2004/000067<br>
12<br>
A network 80 such as the internet for real-time tournament transmission;<br>
and<br>
At least one central remote worldwide databank of chess 90.<br>
As mentioned previously, ECMs are in wireless communication with each other.<br>
Since both players are obligated to enter the moves, there is a Master and Slave<br>
ECMs. Master / Slave Mode is negotiated between two ECMs at the beginning of<br>
the game. Master is the one transmitting the moves, and slave is in a stand-by<br>
mode in order to avoid duplication of data transmission. Should Master stop<br>
operating, the Slave takes over the game transmission. Of course, the ECMs can<br>
be paired up by entering the opponent's name, or any other means, so that the<br>
ECMs are correctly paired up,<br>
\n off-line game mode (when central chess tournament manager is not available),<br>
units can store chess game data and transfer it to a PC via cable.<br>
Upon completion of a tournament, the chess tournament manager 10 can produce<br>
chess pairing automatically and transmit it to ECMs, so chess players would know<br>
whom they are playing with. Chess players and their trainers could download their<br>
opponent's games for analysis and match preparation.<br>
Transmission from ECM to a database is encrypted in game recording mode.<br>
Communication is secure and encrypted with handshake protocols between ECMs<br>
and chess tournament managers and worldwide databank of chess, following<br>
known techniques.<br>
The chess tournament manager 10 has a capability of automatic tournament<br>
organization, automatic pairing, chess magazine and bulletin editing, and<br>
automatic rating calculation.<br><br>
WO 2004/064957	PCT/CA20O4/000O67<br>
13<br>
Client - Server logic is implemented between ECMs and chess tournament<br>
managers with a shared chess rules library 161. ECMs application logic consists<br>
of Device Application User Interface 150, Device Application Logic 155 and Client<br>
Service Interface 160, which further communicates with the Server Service<br>
Interface 170. Chess tournament manager is acting as a server and its application<br>
logic consists of Device Application Logic 175, Server Application Logic 190 and<br>
Tournament Management 185 communicating with the Data Access Logic 180.<br>
The worldwide databank of chess consists of:<br>
Main worldwide storage of chess games 100, for global collection of chess<br>
games;<br>
Backup worldwide storage of chess games 101, which backups the main<br>
worldwide databank;<br>
Network 102 such as the internet, for transmission and viewing of chess<br>
games, which receives information from tournaments 104 connected to the<br>
Internet via 103.<br>
Interface for live chess game TV broadcasts 105.<br>
Once accessing the worldwide databank, user may be authenticated with a strong<br>
authentication (for example, needs to have a password and a dynamic key, which<br>
is changing often).<br>
Wireless networks of Electronic Chess Managers communicate securely chess<br>
game information to a central storage server. Using this system, chess<br>
tournaments can be followed worldwide on TV and / or over the Internet. The<br>
system has information security protection, which consists of chess player<br>
authentication and network security.<br>
Although the present invention has been explained hereinabove by the way of a<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, ft should be pointed out that any modifications to<br><br>
