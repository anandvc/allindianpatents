COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
TOOTHPASTE COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backfoay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
 <br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>

TOOTHPASTE COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to toothpaste compositions having superior in use sensory benefits. 5<br>
There are very many toothpaste compositions known in the art.  Some of these comprise oils, such a flavouring oils or triglyceride oils.  We have found that such compositions can have in use sensory problems because of the effect of the 10  oil.  In particular, we have found that the nature of the foam generated by the surfactant present in the toothpaste can be adversely affected.<br>
Surprisingly, we have found that superior sensory benefits 15  may be attained via the incorporation of a sulphated or<br>
sulphonated polysaccharide and a carboxylated polysaccharide into a toothpaste composition comprising a triglyceride oil. In use sensory benefits, in particular the perceived foam quality of the product, are significantly improved by the 20  present invention.<br>
In a first of aspect of the present invention, there is provided a toothpaste composition comprising a surfactant, an abrasive, a humectant, a triglyceride oil, a carboxylated 2 5  polysaccharide, and a sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide.<br>
In a second of aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of cleaning the teeth comprising brushing 30  with a composition according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
 <br>
WO 2008/119605<br>
 <br>
PCT/EP2008/052445<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
In a third of aspect of the present invention, there is provided the use of a sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide, in particular a carrageenan, to improve the in use foam quality of a toothpaste also comprising a 5  surfactant, an abrasive, a humectant, a triglyceride oil, and a carboxylated polysaccharide.<br>
The surfactant used in accordance with the invention may be an anionic, nonionic, cationic, zwitterionic or amphoteric 10  surfactant, or mixtures thereof.  Preferably, the surfactant is anionic, in particular an alkali metal alkyl sulphate, and especially sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS).<br>
The total amount of surfactant is typically from 0.1 to 10%, 15  in particular from 0.5 to 5%, and especially from 1 to 3% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The abrasive used in accordance with the invention is typically a particulate abrasive material such as a silica,<br>
20  alumina, calcium carbonate, dicalciumphosphate, calcium<br>
pyrophosphate, hydroxyapatite, trimetaphosphate, insoluble hexametaphosphate, or mixtures thereof.  Agglomerated particulate abrasive materials may also be used.  Preferred abrasive materials are chalk and silica, in particular<br>
25  silica.<br>
The total amount of abrasive is typically from 3 to	60%, in<br>
particular from 5 to 40%, and especially from 6% to	20% by<br>
weight of the total composition.<br>
30<br>
The humectant used in accordance with the invention	is<br>
typically a polyol, in particular a polyol selected	from<br>
 <br>
WO 2008/119605<br>
 <br>
PCTYEP2008/052445<br>
 <br>
- 3 -<br>
glycerol, sorbitol, propyleneglycol, xylitol, lactitol, or mixtures thereof.  Sorbitol is especially preferred, this material also functioning as a sweetener (vide  infra).<br>
5  The total amount of humectant is typically from 1 to 60%, in particular from 5 to 50%, and especially from 10% to 30%  by weight of the total composition.<br>
The triglyceride oil used in accordance with the invention 10  is preferably sunflower oil, said oil providing a valuable source of Vitamin F to the teeth.  With compositions comprising sunflower oil, the sensory benefits of the present invention have been particularly evident.  More than one triglyceride oil may be present in the composition. 15<br>
The total amount of triglyceride oil is typically from 0.5%, in particular from 1%, and especially from 1.5% by weight of the total composition.  In order that the sensory benefits associated with the triglyceride oil are not too difficult 20  to overcome, the amount of triglyceride oil is typically less than 10%, in particular less 7%, and especially less than 5% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The carboxylated polysaccharide used in accordance with the 25  invention is typically a cellulose derivative, in particular a carboxyalkyl cellulose, and especially<br>
carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), typically used as its sodium salt (SCMC).  The carboxylated polysaccharide typically serves to thicken the toothpaste and also contributes to the 30  sensory properties of the toothpaste.<br>

 <br>
PCT/EP2008/052445<br>

The total amount of carboxylated polysaccharide is typically from 0.2%, in particular from 0.5%, and especially from 0.8% by weight of the total composition.  The total amount is preferably less than 5%, more preferably less 2%, and most 5  preferably less than 1% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide used in accordance with the invention is typically a sulphated polysaccharide, in particular a linear sulphated<br>
0  polysaccharide, and especially a carrageenan.  Of the three main commercial classes of carrageenan (Kappa, ex Kappaphycus  cottonii;   Iota, ex Eucheuma  spinosum;   and Lambda, the common source of which is Gigartina); Kappa and Iota are preferred.  The sulphated or sulphonated<br>
5  polysaccharide typically serves to thicken the toothpaste and also contributes beneficially to the sensory properties of the toothpaste.<br>
The total amount of sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide 0  is preferably from 0.1%, more preferably from 0.25%, and most preferably from 0.4% by weight of the total composition.  The total amount is preferably less than 3%, more preferably less 1.5%, and most preferably less than 0.6% by weight of the total composition. 5<br>
The weight ratio of the total amount of carboxylated polysaccharide to the total amount of sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide is preferably from 1:2 to 10:1, more preferably from 1:1 to 5:1, most preferably from 3:2 to 0  3:1.<br>

The preferable, more preferable, and most preferable total amounts of sulphated or sulphonated polysaccharide and the preferable, more preferable, and most preferable ratios of carboxylated polysaccharide to sulphated or sulphonated 5  polysaccharide are believed to be particularly beneficial in delivering the sensory benefits of the present invention, especially at the more typical levels of surfactant and oil inclusion.<br>
10  The toothpaste composition according to the invention may comprise further ingredients.  In addition to the aforementioned cellulose derivatives, other materials that modify the rheological properties of the toothpaste may also be employed.  Preferred additional ingredients of this type<br>
15  are polyethylene glycols and thickening silicas, such as<br>
®<br>
Tixosil 43 , ex Rhddia.  Other ingredients of this type are xanthan gum, gum Arabic, synthetic polyacrylates, and synthetic carboxyvinyl polymers such as Carbopol .<br>
20  In addition to the aforementioned triglyceride oil, other oils such as   flavouring oils may also be present.  Typical flavouring oils include peppermint and spearmint oil.<br>
Vitamins sources, in particular sources of vitamin E, such 2 5  as vitamin E acetate are a preferred further ingredient.  A source of vitamin E is particular preferred in compositions also comprising sunflower oil, so that sources of both vitamin E and vitamin F are present (vide supra).<br>
30  Antimicrobial agents are further ingredients that may be advantageously employed in compositions of the invention.<br>
