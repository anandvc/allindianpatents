				<td>Dye mixture of water-soluble fiber-reactive dyes, preparation thereofand use thereof<br>
This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
Numerous fiber-reactive dye mixtures are known, for example from US patents 5,445,654 and<br>
5,611,821, and also from Korean patent 94-2560 and the Japanese reference Sho 58-160 362,<br>
for producing black dyeings on hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing fibers, such as<br>
cellulosic fibers in particular. EP-A 158 233 describes numerous mixtures of fiber-reactive<br>
dyes, in each of which one dye component is employed as a shading component.<br>
However, these dye mixtures have certain application defects, for example an excessive<br>
dependence of the color yield on changing dyeing parameters in the dyeing operation, or an<br>
inadequate or unlevel build-up on cotton, good build-up resulting from the ability of a dye to<br>
provide a stronger dyeing when used in a higher dye concentration in the dyebath. One<br>
consequence of these defects can be poor reproducibilities for the dyeings which are<br>
obtainable.<br>
However, it is especially important to obtain dyeings having a good color yield, ie dyeings<br>
whose depth of shade is very high in relation to the amount of dye used, for example owing to<br>
a high absorbance and owing to good dyeing characteristics of this dye, for example a high<br>
affinity and a high fixation yield. When mixtures of dyes having a certain color yield are used,<br>
it is the rule that the color yield of these mixtures of dyes is the sum total of the color yields of<br>
the individual dyes, which is why the color yield of a mixture of, for example, two dyes will<br>
be lower than the color yield obtained when the dye having the larger color yield property is<br>
used as the only dye but in the total amount of the two individual dyes. This also applies to the<br>
service fastnesses such as the light, wash, hotpress and chlorine fastnesses for example. With<br>
these fastnesses, moreover, there is often a negative synergy effect known as catalytic fading,<br>
so that fastnesses of mixtures can be less than those of the individual dyes.<br>
The present inventors have now surprisingly, found that, the color strength of the hereinbelow<br>
described dye mixtures according to the present invention is surprisingly higher than the sum<br>
total of the color strengths afforded by the individual dyes in the mixture. This positive<br>
synergistic effect also shows itself in improved build-up characteristics for the mixture<br>
according to the present invention compared with that of the individual dyes in the mixture<br>
and also in fastnesses which in some instances are superior to the average of the individual<br>
fastnesses.<br>
The present invention accordingly provides dye mixtures which include at least one dye of the<br>
general formula (1) and at least one dye of the general formula (2)<br>

In general, the dye of the general formula (1) and the dye of the general formula (2) are<br>

preferably in a ratio of 80:20% by weight to 20:80% by weight. More preferably, the two dyes<br>
are present in the dye mixture according to the present invention in a ratio of 65:35 to 35:65%<br>
by weight.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention can,be present as a preparation in solid or in liquid<br>
(dissolved) form. In solid form, they generally include the electrolyte salts customary for<br>
water-soluble and especially for fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium ,<br>
chloride and sodium sulfate, and may further include the auxiliaries customary in commercial<br>
dyes, such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7,<br>
such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate,<br>
sodium citrate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, or small amounts of siccatives or, when they<br>
are present in a liquid, aqueous solution (including the presence of thickeners of the type<br>
customary in print pastes) they may also include substances which ensure a long life for these<br>
preparations, for example mold preventatives.<br>
In general, the dye mixtures of the present invention are present as dye powders containing<br>
10% to 80% by weight, based on the dye powder or the preparation, of an electrolyte salt<br>
which is also known as a standardizing agent. These dye powders may additionally include the<br>
aforementioned buffer substances in a total amount of up to 10% by weight, based on the dye<br>
powder. When the dye mixtures of the present invention are present in aqueous solution, the<br>
total dye content of these aqueous solutions will be up to about 75% by weight, for example<br>
between 5 and 75% by weight, and the electrolyte salt content of these aqueous solutions will<br>
preferably be below 10% by weight, based on the aqueous solution; the aqueous solutions<br>
(liquid preparations) may include the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount which is<br>
generally up to 10% by weight and preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
Dyes of the general formula (1) are known and can be synthesized as described in<br>
US 5 725 641, EP-A 668328 and DE 4306432. For instance, common diazotizing and<br>
coupling reaction can be used to construct the bisazo compounds and subsequently, in a<br>
manner familiar to one skilled in the art, the dyes of the formula (1) according to the present<br>
invention prepared by coppering: 2-amino-8-hydroxy-6-sulfonaphthalene (la)<br>
is diazotized with sodium nitrite in a hydrochloric acid medium and coupled onto a comDound<br>
of the formula (lb)<br>
to obtain the corresponding monoazo compound of the formula (lc)<br>
Diazotization of the aniline compound (Id) with sodium nitrite in hydrochloric acid solution<br>
and coupling onto the compound of the formula (lc) gives the bisazo compound (le)<br>
which is converted into the compound of the formula (1) by coppering with a copper salt at<br>
elevated temperature and a pH between 5 and 7.<br>
Dyes of the general formula (2) are known from the patent documents EP-A 629 667,<br>
EP-A 625551, EP-A 626429, EP-A 4320632, WO 9418381 and EP-A 6442392. For instance,<br>
a compound of the general formula (2a). where W and R4 are each as defined above, can be<br>
diazotized in a mineral acid medium at 0-10°C by addition of sodium nitrite and the resulting<br>
diazonium salt can be reduced to the hydrazine (2a) in a manner familiar to one skilled in the<br>
art. The reducing agent used is preferably hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal<br>
catalyst:<br>
This hydrazine (2a) is then reacted with an appropriate substituted benzaldehyde to form a<br>
hydrazone (2b)<br>
where R5 is as defined above. The hydrazone of the formula (2b) reacts with diazonium salts<br>
in the presence of copper salts to form the corresponding formazans. For instance, reaction of<br>
(2b) with the diazonium salt (2c") for A equal to SO2Y3, where Y3 is as defined above, and<br>
reaction of (2b) with the diazonium salt (2c") for A equal to a moiety of the general<br>
formula (3) in the compound (2) to be prepared, in the presence of copper at a pH of 4-9, give<br>
respectively the formazan (2d") and the formazan (2d").<br>
Alkaline hydrolysis of (2d") at elevated temperature gives the free amine (2e) which can be<br>
reacted with fiber-reactive systems such as for example trifluorotriazine, trifluoropyrimidines<br>
or trichlorotriazine.<br>
A substitution reaction familiar to one skilled in the art is finally used to introduce the<br>
radical B of the aforementioned meaning into the compound of the formula (2e), and the thus<br>
obtained compound of the general formula (2) is isolated in a conventional manner by salting<br>
out or spray drying.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention are preparable in a conventional manner, for<br>
instance by mechanically mixing the individual dyes, which are present in solid or in liquid<br>
form, in the requisite proportions.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention have useful application properties. They are used<br>
for dyeing or printing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials, for example in the<br>
form of sheetlike structures, such as paper and leather or of films, for example composed of<br>
polyamide, or in bulk, as for example of polyamide and polyurethane, but especially for<br>
dyeing or printing these materials in fiber form. Similarly, the solutions of the dye mixtures of<br>
the present invention that are obtained in the synthesis of the azo compounds, if appropriate<br>
after addition of a buffer substance and if appropriate after concentrating or diluting, can be<br>
used directly as liquid preparation for dyeing.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to the use of the dye mixtures of the present invention<br>
for dyeing or printing these materials, or rather to processes for dyeing or printing these ,<br>
materials in a conventional manner, by using a dye mixture of the present invention as<br>
colorant. The materials are preferably employed in the form of fiber materials, especially in<br>
the form of textile fibers, such as woven fabrics Or yams, as in the form of hanks or wound<br>
packages.<br>
Hydroxyl-containing materials are those of natural or synthetic origin, for example cellulose<br>
fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols. Cellulose fiber materials<br>
are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such as linen, hemp, jute and ramie<br>
fibers; regenerated cellulose fibers are for example staple viscose and filament viscose.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example synthetic and natural polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes, especially in the form of fibers, for example wool and other animal hairs, silk,<br>
leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6, nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention can be applied to and fixed on the substrates<br>
mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application techniques known for<br>
water-soluble dyes, especially fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
For instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor using<br>
various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts, such as sodium chloride or sodium<br>
sulfate, dyeings having very good color yields which are improved compared with the<br>
individual dyes. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40<br>
and 105°C, optionally at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, and<br>
optionally in the presence of customary dyeing auxiliaries. One possible procedure is to<br>
introduce the material into the warm bath and to gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing<br>
temperature and to complete the dyeing process at that temperature. The neutral salts which<br>
accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes may also, if desired, only be added to the bath after the<br>
actual dyeing temperature has been reached.<br>
The padding process likewise provides excellent color yields and very good color build-up on<br>
cellulose fibers, the dyes being allowed to become fixed on the material by batching at room<br>
temperature or at elevated temperature, for example at up to 60°C, by steaming or using dry<br>
heat in a conventional manner.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried out<br>
either single-phase, for example by printing with a print paste comprising sodium bicarbonate<br>
or some other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103°C, or two-phase,<br>
for example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print color and subsequent fixation<br>
either by passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-comprising alkaline bath or by<br>
overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-comprising padding liquor with subsequent batching<br>
of the alkali-overpadded material or subsequent steaming or subsequent treatment with dry<br>
heat, produce strong prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The<br>
appearance of the prints is not greatly affected by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix processes, hot<br>
air from 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101 to 103°C it is also<br>
possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at temperatures of up to 160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes of the dye mixtures of the<br>
present invention on the cellulose fibers include for example water-soluble basic salts of the<br>
alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or compounds<br>
which liberate alkali in the heat. Especially suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali<br>
metal salts of weak to medium inorganic or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal<br>
compounds being the sodium and potassium compounds. Such acid-binding agents include for<br>
example sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium formate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium<br>
hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate, waterglass or trisodium phosphate.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention are notable for a high yield of fixation when applied<br>
to the cellulose fiber materials by dyeing or printing. The cellulose dyeings obtained following<br>
the customary aftertreatment by rinsing to remove unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent<br>
wetfastnesses, in particular since such unfixed dye portions are easily washed off on account<br>
of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
The dyeings and prints obtainable with the dye mixtures of the present invention have bright<br>
hues; especially the dyeings and prints on cellulose fiber materials have good lightfastness and<br>
very good wetfastnesses, such as wash, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and<br>
also alkaline perspiration fastness properties, also good fastness to hotpressing and rubbing.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures of the present invention can also be used for the fiber-reactive<br>
dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting finish (cf.<br>
for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd Edition (1972), p.<br>
295-299, especially the finish by the Hercosett process (p. 298); J. Soc. Dyers and Colorists<br>
1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed with very good fastness properties.<br>
The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner from an acidic<br>
medium. For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid and ammonium<br>
acetate or sodium acetate may be added to the dyebath to obtain the desired pH. To obtain a<br>
dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary leveling agent, for example<br>
on the basis of a reaction product of cyanuric chloride with 3 times the molar amount of an<br>
aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a<br>
reaction product of for example stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye<br>
mixture of the present invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from<br>
an acidic dyebath having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward<br>
the end of the dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to<br>
a pH of 8.5 to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between the<br>
dyes of the dye mixtures of the present invention and the fiber. At the same time, the dye<br>
portion not reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber materials<br>
composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and polyurethanes. In<br>
general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a temperature of about 40°C,<br>
agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to the desired weakly acidic,<br>
preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is carried out at a temperature between<br>
60 and 98°C. However, the dyeings can also be carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing<br>
apparatus at temperatures of up to 106°C. Since the water solubility of the dye mixtures of the<br>
present invention is very good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous<br>
dyeing processes. The color strength of the dye mixtures of the present invention is very high.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention dye the materials mentioned, preferably fiber<br>
materials, in gray to bluish black shades.<br>
The examples hereinbelow serve to illustrate the present invention. They are preparable in an<br>
inventive manner by mechanically mixing the individual dyes in solid or liquid form. Parts<br>
and percentages are by weight, unless otherwise stated. The compounds described in the<br>
examples in terms of a formula are in some instances indicated in the form of the free acids; in<br>
general they are prepared and isolated in the form of their salts, preferably sodium or<br>
potassium salts, and used for dyeing in the form of their salts. The dye mixtures of the present<br>
invention have very good application properties and provide on the materials mentioned in the<br>
description, in particular cellulosic fiber materials, by the application methods customary in<br>
the art for dyeing and printing, preferably by the application and fixing methods customary in<br>
the art for fiber-reactive dyes, strong dyeings and prints having good fastness properties and<br>
particularly good tainting performance especially with regard to polyester in continuous<br>
dyeing by the pad-steam process.<br>
Examples:<br>
1. (a) 23.9 parts of 2-amino-8-hydroxy-6-sulfonaphthalene are dissolved in 200 parts of<br>
water by addition of sodium carbonate to give a neutral solution. It is admixed with<br>
6.9 parts of sodium nitrite. The solution is added dropwise to a mixture of 100 parts of ice<br>
and 100 parts of half-concentrated hydrochloric acid. This is followed by 1 hour of stirring<br>
before the excess nitrite is destroyed with urea.<br>
1. (b) 28.5 parts of l-(4-sulfo)phenyl-3-carboxypyrazol-5-one are dissolved in 100 parts of<br>
water at pH 6. The diazonium salt of (a) is added dropwise while a pH between 4-7 is<br>
maintained by addition of sodium carbonate.<br>
1 (c) 34 parts of 2,5-dimethoxy-4(B-sulfatoethylsulfonyl)aniline are dissolved in 200 parts<br>
of water by addition of sodium carbonate to give a neutral solution. It is admixed with<br>
6.9 parts of sodium nitrite. The solution is added dropwise to a mixture of 100 parts of ice<br>
and 100 parts of half-concentrated hydrochloric acid. This is followed by 1 hour of<br>
stirring before the excess nitrite is destroyed with urea.<br>
The diazonium salt solution of (c) is then added dropwise to the reaction solution of (b) while<br>
the pH is maintained between 4 and 7 by addition of sodium carbonate. This is followed by<br>
1 hour of stirring, addition of 14 parts of copper chloride and heating at 100°C for 3 days<br>
during which the pH is maintained between 5 and 7 by addition of sodium carbonate. The dye<br>
is precipitated by addition of ethanol at room temperature and isolated by filtration. This<br>
affords 110 pans of the dye (A):<br>
The following dyes which conform to the general formula (1) were prepared in a similar<br>
manner:<br>
2. (a) 3-Amino-4-carboxyphenylsulfonic acid is diazotized in hydrochloric acid at 0-10°C<br>
by addition of sodium nitrite and the resulting diazonium salt is reduced to the<br>
hydrazine (a) with hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst.<br>
2. (b) This hydrazine is then reacted with an appropriately substituted benzaldehyde at<br>
20-40°C in water to give the hydrazone (b).<br>
2. (c) Reaction of (b) with (c) in the presence of copper at pH 4-9 gives the formazan (d)<br>
Alkaline hydrolysis of (d) at elevated temperature gives the free amine (e).<br>
Reaction of (e) with trichlorotriazine at 0-20°C gives the corresponding dichlorotriazinyl<br>
compound which reacts with N-ethyl-3-B-vinylsulfonylaniline at room temperature to form the<br>
dye (L) which is in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The following dyes which conform to the general formula (2) were prepared in a similar<br>
manner:<br>
Examples 1-162<br>
Dissolving dyes of the formulae A-G and copper formazans of the formulae H-Z in water in<br>
accordance with the proportions reported in the table and subsequent isolation by spray drying<br>
gave the following mixtures according to the present invention:<br>
Example 163<br>
A mixture of 2 parts of dye A and 1 part of dye H (example 74) was dyed up at various<br>
concentrations in a liquor ratio of 10:1 at 60°C as per the table which follows after<br>
normalization for color strength (by use of the different extinction coefficients). The alkali and<br>
salt quantities are reported in table 2:<br>
The color strength of the dyeings obtained, measured in terms of color density units, was<br>
plotted in a graph against the respective individual dyeings of the dyes A and H:<br>
It is clearly evident in the graph that the mixture of the dyes A and H surprisingly builds up<br>
better than the mathematical average of the individual values of the dyes A and H.<br>
