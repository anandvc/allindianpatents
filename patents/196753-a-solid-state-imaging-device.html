				<td>The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging device.<br>
The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging device, and more particularly to an amplifying type solid-state imaging device or a solid-state imaging device such as a MOS (metal oxide semiconductor) solid-state imaging device.<br>
As a demand that a solid-state imaging device becomes high in resolution is increased, an internal amplifying type solid-state imaging device has hitherto been developed, and other MOS type solid-state imaging devices also have been known so far.<br>
As the internal amplifying type solid-state imaging device, there are mainly known a static induction transistor (SIT), an amplifying type MOS imager (AMI), a charge-modulation device (CMD), and various imaging device structures such as a BASIS (base-stored image sensor) using bipolar transistors as pixels.<br>
The following amplifying type solid-state imaging device is known as one of such internal amplifying type solid-state imaging devices. This amplifying type solid-state imaging device accumulates photoelectrically-converted holes (signal charges) in a p-type potential well in an n-channel MOS transistor (pixel MOS transistor), \nd outputs the change of channel current based on a potential fluctuation (i.e., potential change in back gate) in the p-type potential well as a<br>
pixel signal.<br>
On the other hand, the assignee of the present<br>
application has previously proposed a.	operation<br>
system amplifying type solid-state imaging device in which a sensitivity can be made uniform, a high resolution can be made, and a low power consumption can be realized.<br>
FIG. I of the accompanying drawings shows an example<br>
of a capacity loaded operation system amplifying type solid-<br>
state imaging device. In this amplifying type solid-state<br>
imaging device 1, as shown in FIG.1, light-receiving elements<br>
comprising a plurality of unit"	e.g., pixeltransistors, in this example pixel MOS transistors 2 are<br>
pulses) are applied to<br>
the scanning lines 4	of  from the vertical scanning<br>
circuit 3 to the pixel MOS transistors 7 of<br>
Also, hen the operation MOS switch 7 is turned<br>
by the   pixel MOS transistor 2 and the<br>
load capacity element 8 are  <br>
When the<br>
operation MOS switch 7 is •	the signal voltage is<br>
stabilized sufficiently, a signal voltage corresponding to a channel potential corresponding to the amount of signal charges (amount of holes) accumulated in the pixel MOS transistor 2 is held in the load capacity element 8.<br>
The	held in the load capacity element 8<br>
is flowed to the	as electric charge<br>
when the horizontal-	are sequentially<br>
the horizontal scanning signals (i.e., horizontal scanning<br>
pulses) supplied thereto from the<br>
horizontal scanning circuit 11 during the horizontal scanning period.<br>
The signal charge flowed to the horizontal signal line<br>
10 is	of the<br>
charge detecting circuit 16 using the operational amplifier 13 as a signal  outputted to the output terminal t1 as as<br>
The detection capacity element 14 of the charge<br>
**<br>
detecting circuit 16<br>
a reset pulse <j>R before the horizontal MOS switch 9<br>
corresponding to the next pixel MOS transistor is turned on.<br>
According to the amplifying type solid-state imaging device 1, when the signal voltage is held in the"]<br>
ubstantially no current is flowed to me vertical<br>
.A- signal line 5 so that a uniform::	can be obtained<br>
 without being affected by a resistance of the vertical signal     line 5 very much.<br><br>
         Further, since the load (Is xt he capacity element (24   ^-r^<br><br>
   signal charges cannot be fluctuated less unlike the load MOS<br>
  I transistor, and hence a vertical<br>
	is difficult to be generated.<br>
Further, since the channel potential of the pixel MOS transistor 2 becomes a potential held in the load capacity element 8 as it is, a sensitivity can be increased as compared with the case that the pixel MOS transistor is operated in the stationary state by the load MOS transistor, i.e., under the condition that a constant current is flowed to the channel.<br>
Furthermore, a steady-state current is not flowed to<br>
  the pixel MOS transistor 2, a power consumption can be<br>
   decreased.<br><br>
As the horizontal MOS switch 9 of this amplifying type solid-state imaging device 1, there is used a MOS transistor of which the structure is illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
In the MOS transistor 9, a source region 22S and a drain region 22D are formed on semiconductor regions separated<br>
by a field insulating layer (so-called LOCOS oxide layer) 21 provided by selective oxidation, and a gate electrode 23 made of polycrystalline silicon, for example, is formed between the source region 22S and the drain region 22D through a gate insulation film.<br>
The gate electrode 23 is connected to the horizontal scanning circuit 11. A source electrode 24 and a drain electrode 24D are made of Al, for example, and the drain electrode 24D is connected to the vertical signal line 5 through the operation MOS switch. The source electrode 24S is connected to the horizontal signal line 10. In Fig. 2, reference numeral 26 denotes a contact portion and 27 an Al interconnection.<br>
With the above mentioned arrangement, since the source regions 22 S of many horizontal switches 9 are connected to the horizontal signal line 10, a parasitic capacity element of the horizontal signal line 10 is increased, thus lowering a detection sensitivity of the charge detecting circuit 16.<br>

A solid-state imaging device according to the pi invention will hereinafter be described with reference to drawings.<br>
FIGS. 3 and 4 show a solid-state imaging device according to a first embodiment of the present invention w<br>
is applied to a load capacity operation system amplifying type solid-state imaging device.<br>
The solid-state imaging device shown in FIG. 3 has an equivalent circuit arrangement similar to that shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 3, reference numeral 31 generally denotes an amplifying type solid-state imaging device. Reference numeral 32 denotes a light-receiving element comprising a unit pixel (cell), e.g., pixel transistor, i.e., pixel MOS transistor in this embodiment. A plurality of pixel MOS transistors 32 are arranged in a matrix fashion. Reference numeral 34 denotes vertical scanning lines connected to gates of the pixel MOS transistors 32 provided at every row. The vertical scanning lines 34 are connected to a vertical scanning circuit 33, and supplied with vertical<br>
scanning signals, i.e., vertical scanning pulses 4&gt;V<br><j>Vn, 
33. The source of the pixel MOS transistor 32 is connected to a vertical signal line 35 at every column, and the drain thereof is connected to the power supply source VDD.<br>
A load capacity element 38 for holding a signal voltage (electric charge) is connected to each vertical signal line 35 through an operation MOS switch 37. Specifically, the load capacity element 38 is connected between the vertical signal line 35 and a first potential, e.g., ground potential in<br>
this embodiment, and the operation pulse 4&gt;0p is applied to the<br>
gate of the operation MOS switch 37. The load capacity element 38 is connected to the drain of a horizontal switch, i.e., an<br>
insulating gate type field-effect transistor (hereinafter referred to as a "horizontal MOS switch") 39, and the source of the horizontal MOS switch 39 is connected to a horizontal signal line 40.<br>
Reference numeral 41 denotes a horizontal scanning circuit comprising a suitable means such as a shift register. The horizontal scanning circuit 41 sequentially supplies the<br>
horizontal scanning pulses <j>H [<j>Hlf ... Hi, <j>Hi+1,.. . ] to the<br>
gates of the horizontal MOS switches 39 connected to the horizontal signal line 40.<br>
To the output end of the horizontal signal line 40 is connected a signal detecting means, e.^., a charge detecting circuit 46 which comprises an operational amplifier 43 using an inverting amplifier, e.g., a differential amplifier, a detection capacitor element 44 and a reset switch 45.<br>
Specifically, the horizontal signal line 40 is connected to an inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier 43 in the charge detecting circuit 46, and a predetermined bias voltage VB is applied to a non-inverting<br>
input terminal of the operational amplifier 43. The bias voltage VB is used to determined a potential of the horizontal signal<br>
line 40.  The detection capacitor element 44 is connected in parallel to the operational amplifier 43, i.e., between the inverting input terminal of the operational amplifier 43 and an output terminal t2, and the reset switch 45 which resets the<br>
horizontal signal line 40 and the detection capacitor element 44<br>
is connected in parallel to the detection capacitor element 44. The reset switch 45 is composed of a MOS transistor, for example, and a reset pulse <j>R is applied to the gate of the<br>
reset switch 45.<br>
The operational amplifier 43 should preferably be composed of a MOS transistor because no input current is flowed to the MOS transistor or an input impedance of the MOS transistor is high.<br>
FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor structure of the unit pixel (i.e., pixel MOS transistor) 32.<br>
In FIG. 5, reference numeral 51 denotes a first conductivity type, e.g., p-type silicon substrate, 52 a second conductivity type, e.g., n-type well region, and 53 a p-type well region in which photoelectrically-converted holes (signal charges) 54 are accumulated when light is received by this solid-state imaging device.<br>
An n-type source region 55 and a drain region 56 are formed on the p-type well region 53, and a gate electrode 58G made of polycrystalline silicon thin film is formed between the two regions 55 and 56 through a gate insulating film 57. The holes 54 that were accumulated in the p-type well region 53 located under the gate electrode 58G by photoelectric conversion are used to control a channel current (drain current) upon reading operation, and the changed amount of channel current becomes a signal output.<br>
The gate electrode 58G is connected to the vertical<br><br>
scanning line 34, a drain electrode 58D is connected to the power supply source VDD, and a source electrode 58S is connected<br>
to the vertical signal line 35.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a driving timing chart of this amplifying type solid-state imaging device 31.<br>
In the amplifying type solid-state imaging device 31, when the operation MOS switch 37 with a drain connected to the vertical signal line 35 is turned on by application of the operation pulse op to the gate thereof, a signal voltage from<br>
the pixel MOS switch transistor 32 is read out to the load capacity element 38 during the first half of horizontal blanking period HBK.  The load capacity element 38 is held at a potential, i.e., voltage corresponding to a channel potential corresponding to an amount of signal charges accumulated in each pixel MOS transistor 32. The signal voltage read out to the load capacity element 38 turns on the horizontal MOS switches 39, which are sequentially scanned by the horizontal scanning circuit 41, during a horizontal video period, and outputted to the horizontal signal line 40.<br>
More specifically, the vertical scanning pulses <j>V<br>
[<j>V!, ... vn, Vn+1, ...] from the vertical scanning circuit 33<br>
are sequentially applied to the scanning lines 34 of respective rows, and the pixel MOS transistors 32 of respective rows are scanned sequentially. When the potential of the vertical<br>
scanning pulse <j>Vn applied to the scanning line 34 of nth row, for example, goes to high level, the pixel MOS transistor 32 of<br><br>
nth row is placed in the selection state. The potential of the scanning line 34 corresponding to the non-selection goes to low level, and hence other pixel MOS transistor 32 that is connected to this scanning line 34 is placed in the non-selection state. When the operation MOS switch 37 is turned on by the<br>
operation pulse <j>OP/ the pixel MOS transistor 32 of nth row is<br>
energized, and a signal is developed at the terminal of the load capacity element 38 in response to an amount of signal charges (holes) accumulated in the amount of light incident on the pixel MOS transistor 32. Then, when the operation MOS switch 37 is turned off during the horizontal blanking period HBK, a signal voltage corresponding to the channel potential of the pixel MOS transistor 32 is held in the load capacity element 38. This operation is referred to as "capacitor load operation", and is generally carried out during the horizontal blanking period HBK.<br>
The signal charge (electric charge) held in the load capacity element 38 from the pixel MOS transistor 32 when the capacitor load operation is carried out during the horizontal blanking period HBK is sequentially flowed to the horizontal signal line 40 as signal charges because the horizontal MOS switches 39 are sequentially turned on by the horizontal<br>
scanning pulses <j>H [<j>Hi, ... <j>Hi, Hi+i, ...] (shown in FIG. 6)<br>
from the horizontal scanning circuit 41.<br>
The signal charge flowed to the horizontal signal line 40 is demodulated to the detection capacitor element 44 of the charge detecting circuit 46 using the operational amplifier 43 as a signal voltage, and then outputted to the output terminal<br>
t2 as a video signal.<br>
The detection capacitor element 44 in the charge detecting circuit 46 turns on and resets the reset switch 45 by the reset pulse CJ&gt;R before the horizontal MOS switch 39<br>
corresponding to the next pixel MOS transistor 32 is turned on. By this reset operation, the horizontal signal line 40 and a voltage across the detection capacitor element 44 are reset to the bias voltage VB. Specifically, after the horizontal MOS<br>
switch 39, for example, has been turned on and the signal output of the pixel MOS transistor 32 has been developed at the output terminal t2, when the reset switch 45 is turned on, the detected<br>
capacity of the charge detecting circuit 44 is reset, initializes the detection capacity, and becomes ready for detecting the signal output of the next pixel MOS transistor 32.<br>
According to this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4, in particular, the insulating gate-type field-effect transistor comprising the horizontal switch, i.e., horizontal MOS switch 39 has channel disposed in two directions between first and second main electrodes connected to the horizontal signal line 40. FIG. 4 is a plan view illustrating an example of a layout of the horizontal MOS switch 39.<br>
In the horizontal MOS switch 39 shown in FIG. 4, a source region 62S is disposed at the center of a semiconductor region separated by a field insulating layer (so-called LOCOS oxide layer) 61 formed by selective oxidation, and opposing drain regions 62Di, 62D2 are disposed at both sides of the<br><br>
source region 62S. Gate electrodes 63Gi and 63G2 made of<br>
polycrystalline silicon, for example, which are connected through gate insulating films to the horizontal scanning circuit 41, are formed between the source region 62S and the drain region 62Dx and between the source region 62S and the drain<br>
region 62D2, respectively.<br>
A source electrode 63S made of Al, for example, connected to the source region 62S is connected to the horizontal signal line 40, and drain electrodes 63Di, 63D2 made<br>
of Al, for example, connected to the drain regions 62DX, 62D2<br>
are connected to the common vertical signal line 35. In FIG. 4, reference numeral 64 denotes a contact portion.<br>
In this horizontal MOS switch 39, the drain regions 62Di, 62D2 are disposed across the source region 62S in an<br>
opposing relation to each other, and the channel between the source and drain is formed in the two directions. In other words, the area of the source region 62S is reduced to about 1/2 of that obtained in the comparative example shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The amount of signal charges developed at the output terminal t2 of the charge detecting circuit 46 greatly depends<br>
on a parasitic capacity CB of the horizontal signal line 40.<br>
Specifically, in the equivalent circuit shown in FIG. 7, CL assumes a capacity of load capacity element 38, CB assumes<br>
the parasitic capacity of the horizontal signal line 40, Cn<br>
assumes a capacity of the detection capacity element 44 of the charge detecting circuit 46, -G assumes a gain of the<br><br>
operational amplifier 43, Vsig assumes a signal voltage held in the load capacity element 38, and Vout assumes an output signal<br>
from the charge detecting circuit 46. Then, a detection sensitivity (i.e., gain of the charge detecting circuit 46) Gain<br>
of the output signal Vout relative to the signal voltage Vsig is expressed by the following equation (1)<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
the above equation (1), since the parasitic capacity CB of the horizontal signal line 40 occupies most of<br>
the source capacity of the horizontal MOS switch 39, if the parasitic capacity CB is reduced, then a sensitivity of the<br>
solid-state imaging device can be improved.<br>
According to the solid-state imaging device 31<br>
according to this embodiment shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the area of source region 62S of the horizontal MOS switch 39 connected to the horizontal signal line 40 is reduced to about half as compared with the area of source region of the horizontal MOS switch 9 in the comparative example shown in FIG. 2. Furthermore, a length of the source region 62S in contact with the field insulating layer 61 is reduced considerably, and hence a source junction capacity can be reduced considerably.<br>
Having compared a source capacity Csource of the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG. 4 with that of FIG. 2, a compared<br>
result is illustrated on the table 1 below.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
However, as shown in FIG. 8, Cj represents the one-dimensional junction capacity of the source region 62S (22S), Cjsw the lateral-direction junction capacity of the field<br>
insulating layer 61 (21) of the source region 62S (22S), and Cgso the capacity between the source and the gate, respectively. LD<br>
is the source width, and W is the channel width (see FIG. 2).<br>
In the calculation of specific example, <br>
Assuming now that 80 % of the parasitic capacity of the horizontal signal line is occupied by the source capacity of the horizontal MOS switch, then when the horizontal MOS switch 39 of the embodiment shown in FIG. 4 is employed, the parasitic capacity CB of the horizontal signal line 40 is decreased by<br>
about 40 % under conditions on the above table 1.<br>
By way of example, if the capacity CL of the load<br>
capacity element 38 (8) is 1 pF, the capacity Cn of the detection capacity element 44 (14) is 1 pF, the parasitic<br>
capacity CB of FIG. 7 is lOpF, and the gain -G of the<br>
differential amplifier 43 (13) ia 20, then according to the aforesaid equation(l), a calculated result of the comparative example shown in FIG. 2 becomes 0.62, and a calculated result of the inventive example of FIG. 4 becomes 0.714. Thus, a sensitivity can be increased by 14%.<br>
In actual practice, if the parasitic capacity CB of<br>
the horizontal signal line 40 is decreased, then the channel width of the horizontal MOS switch 39 may be reduced concurrently therewith. Therefore, the source capacity of the horizontal MOS switch 39 is decreased, and hence a sensitivity can be improved much more.<br>
Since the horizontal MOS switch 39 according to this embodiment includes two drains and two gates for one source, the width of the horizontal MOS switch 30 in the horizontal direction is increased. As a result, it is frequently observed that one horizontal MOS switch cannot be inserted into the horizontal pitch of the pixel MOS transistor 32.<br>
FIG. 9 shows a second embodiment which can improve the above disadvantage of the first embodiment.<br>
In the second embodiment, horizontal MOS switches 30 corresponding to pixel MOS transistors 32 adjacent in the horizontal direction are disposed across one horizontal signal line 40 in the upper and lower directions. Specifically, each horizontal MOS switch corresponding to every other pixel MOS transistor 32 in the horizontal direction is disposed above the horizontal signal line 40 and connected to the horizontal signal<br>
line 40, and each horizontal MOS switch 39 corresponding to another every other pixel MOS transistor 32 is disposed under the horizontal signal line 40 and connected to the horizontal signal line 40.<br>
A structure of the horizontal MOS switch 39 is the same as that shown in FIG. 4. The layout pattern of the horizontal MOS switch according to the second embodiment shown in FIG. 9 becomes advantageous when the horizontal pitch of the pixel MOS transistor 32 is narrow.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a layout of horizontal MOS switch according to a third embodiment obtained when the horizontal pitch of the pixel MOS transistor 32 is narrower than the width of the horizontal MOS switch 39. According to this embodiment, there are prepared a plurality of, i.e., two horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB, and the horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to the pixel MOS transistors 32 adjacent in the horizontal direction are separately connected to the first and second horizontal signal lines 40A and 40B.<br>
Specifically, the horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to every other pixel MOS transistors 32 in the horizontal direction and the horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to another every other pixel MOS transistors 32 are disposed in two stages. The horizontal MOS switches 39 in the first stage are connected to the first horizontal signal line 40A, and the horizontal MOS switches 39 in the second stage are connected to the second horizontal signal line 4OB.<br>
A transistor structure of the horizontal MOS switch<br>
is similar to that of FIG. 4.<br>
Ends of the two horizontal signal lines 40A, 4OB may be connected electrically, and may be inputted to one charge detecting circuit 46 or each charge detecting circuit 46 may be connected to the horizontal signal lines 40A, 40B (so-called two-line output).  In this embodiment, charge detecting circuits 46A and 46B are connected to the horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB, respectively.<br>
According to this embodiment, even when the horizontal pitch of the pixel MOS transistor 32 is narrower than the width of the horizontal MOS switch 39, the horizontal MOS switches can be arranged, and the solid-state imaging device according to the present invention can be suitable for high-density packing. If the charge detecting circuit 46 is prepared for each of the horizontal signal lines 40 [40A and 40B], then a clock frequency of the horizontal scanning circuit 41 can be lowered to the half, and hence the frequency characteristic of the charge detecting circuit 40 can be lowered, thereby making it possible to improve an S/N (signal-to-noise ratio).<br>
FIG. 11 shows a layout pattern of the horizontal MOS switch 39 according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The layout pattern according to this embodiment is a combination of the layout patterns of FIGS. 9 and 10. As shown in FIG. 11, there are prepared a plurality of, in this embodiment, two horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB. Then, horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to first every other<br>
three pixel transistors in the horizontal direction are disposed in the upper direction across the first horizontal signal line 40A, horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to second every other three pixel MOS transistors are disposed in the upper direction across the second horizontal signal line 4OB, horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to third every other three pixel MOS transistors are disposed in the lower direction across the first horizontal signal line 40A, and horizontal MOS switches 39 corresponding to fourth every other three pixel MOS transistors are disposed in the lower direction across the second horizontal signal line 40B.<br>
The horizontal MOS switches 39 disposed in the upper and lower directions of the first horizontal signal line 40A are connected to the first horizontal signal line 40A, and the horizontal MOS switches 39 disposed in the upper and lower directions of the second horizontal signal line 4OB are connected to the second horizontal signal line 4OB. The gates of the horizontal MOS switches 39 disposed above the first and second horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB are connected in common, and further connected to the horizontal scanning circuit 41. The gates of the horizontal MOS switches 39 disposed under the first and second horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB are connected in common, and further connected to the horizontal scanning circuit 41. The structure of the horizontal MOS switch 39 is the same as that of FIG. 4.<br>
The ends of the two horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB may be connected electrically, and inputted to one charge<br>
detecting circuit 46. Alternatively, each charge detecting circuit 46 may be connected to the two horizontal signal lines 40A and 4OB.  In this embodiment, charge detecting circuits 46A and 46B are connected to the two horizontal signal lines 40A and 40B.<br>
According to the layout pattern of this embodiment, the solid-state imaging device can be applied to the case that the horizontal pitch of the pixel MOS transistor is further narrowed.<br>
According to the above embodiment, since the source capacity of the horizontal MOS switch 30 connected to the horizonal signal line 40 is decreased considerably, a detection sensitivity can be increased. In other words, the gain of the charge detecting circuit 46 can be increased, and hence the S/N ratio can be improved.<br>
While the horizontal MOS switch 39 has such transistor structure that the drain regions 62Di, 62D2 are disposed at both<br>
sides of the central source region 62S to provide the channels in the two directions as described above, the principle of the present invention can also be applied to other transistor structures shown in FIGS. 12, 13 and 14.<br>
In a horizontal MOS switch 39 shown in FIG. 12, an inverse U-letter shaped drain region 62D3 is continuously formed<br>
in an opposing relation to both sides and upper side of the center source region 62S, and a gate electrode 63G3 is formed<br>
between the two regions 62S and 62D3 through a gate insulating film, thereby forming channel in the three directions.  In FIG.<br>
12,	reference numeral 63S denotes a source electrode, and 63Da a<br>
drain electrode, respectively.<br>
In a horizontal MOS switch 39 shown in FIG. 13, an inverse L-letter shaped drain region 62D4 is formed in an<br>
opposing relation to one side portion and upper side portion of the source region 62S,a nd a gate electrode 63G4 is formed<br>
between the two regions 62S and 62D4 through the gate insulating<br>
film, thereby forming channels in the two directions.  In FIG.<br>
13,	reference numeral 63S denotes a source electrode, and 63D4<br>
denotes a drain electrode, respectively.<br>
In a horizontal MOS switch 39 shown in FIG. 14, a drain region 62Ds is formed so as to surround the source region<br>
62S, and a gate electrode 636$ is formed between the two regions 62S and 62D5 through a gate insulating film, thereby forming a<br>
channel in the direction of 360°.  In FIG. 14, reference numeral 63S denotes a source electrode, and 63Ds denote a drain<br>
electrode, respectively.<br>
In case the horizontal MOS switches 39 have the transistor structures shown in FIGS. 12 to 14, then the source capacity can be decreased as compared with the aforesaid comparative example, and the parasitic capacity CB of the<br>
horizontal signal line 40 can be lowered, thereby making it possible to improve a detection sensitivity.<br>
While the amplifying type solid-state imaging device according to the present invention uses the charge detecting circuit 46 as the signal detecting means connected to the<br>
horizontal signal line, the present invention is not limited thereto, and a signal charge may be reconverted by an amplifier with a base grounded or a load resistor into a voltage.<br>
Further, while the present invention is applied to the capacitor load operation system amplifying type solid-state imaging device, the principle of the present invention can also be applied to other amplifying type solid-state imaging device and MOS type solid-state imaging device, etc.<br>
According to the solid-state imaging device of the present invention, the source capacity of the horizontal switch connected to the horizontal signal line can be decreased considerably, and hence the detection sensitivity, i.e., gain of the signal detecting means can be increased, thereby improving the S/N.<br>
According to the solid-state imaging device of the present invention, when the horizontal switches corresponding to the pixels adjacent in the horizontal direction are disposed in the upper and lower direction across the horizontal signal line, the horizontal pitch of the pixels can be narrowed.<br>
Further, according to the solid-state imaging device of the present invention, since the horizontal switches having a plurality of horizontal signal lines and which correspond to horizontal pixels are distributed to and connected to respective horizontal signal lines, even when the horizontal pitch of pixels is narrower than the width of horizontal switch, the horizontal switches can be arranged.<br>
Furthermore, according to the solid-state imaging<br>
device of the present invention, when the horizontal switches having a plurality of horizontal signal lines and which correspond to the pixels of horizontal line are distributed to and connected to a plurality of horizontal signal lines and disposed in the upper and lower directions across each horizontal signal line, even if the horizontal pitch of pixels is further narrowed, then horizontal switches can be arranged.<br>
