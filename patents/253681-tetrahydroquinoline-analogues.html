PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to compounds that affect cholinergic receptors, especially muscarinic receptors. The present invention provides compounds that are agonists of cholinergic receptors including muscarinic receptors, especially the Mi and M4 subtype of muscarinic receptors. The invention also provides methods of using the provided compounds for modulating conditions associated with cholinergic receptors, especially for treating or alleviating disease conditions associated with muscarinic receptors, such as the M1 and/or M4 receptor subtypes.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Muscarinic receptors play a critical role in the central nervous system mediating higher cognitive functions, as well as in the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system where they mediate cardiac, respiratory, digestive, and endocrine and exocrine responses. Five distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes have been identified, M1-M5. The muscarinic Mi receptor subtype is predominantly expressed in the cerebral cortex and is believed to be involved in the control of higher cognitive functions; the M2 receptor is the predominant subtype found in heart and is involved in the control of heart rate; the M3 receptor is widely expressed in many peripheral tissues and is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation; the M4 receptor is present in brain and may be involved in locomotion; the M5, receptor is present in the brain where its role is at present poorly defined. Mi and M4 have been particularly associated with the dopaminergic system.<br>
[0003] Conditions associated with cognitive impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, are accompanied by a reduction of acetylcholine content in the brain. This is believed to be the result of degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, which widely innervate multiple areas of the brain, including the association cortices and hippocampus, that are critically involved in higher processes.<br>
[0004] Efforts to increase acetylcholine levels have focused on increasing levels of choline, the precursor for acetylcholine synthesis, and on blocking acetylcholineesterase (AChE), the enzyme that metabolizes acetylcholine. Attempts to<br>
2<br><br>
augment central cholinergic function through the administration of choline or phosphatidylcholine have not been successful. AChE inhibitors have shown therapeutic efficacy, but have been found to have frequent cholinergic side effects due to peripheral acetylcholine stimulation, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. These gastrointestinal side effects have been observed in about a third of the patients treated. In addition, some AChE inhibitors, such as tacrine, have also been found to cause significant hepatotoxicity with elevated liver transaminases observed in about 30% of patients. The adverse effects of AChE inhibitors have severely limited their clinical utility.<br>
[0005] The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that increased dopamine neurotransmission underlies the positive symptoms of the disease and is supported by the evidence that dopamine receptor blockade is effective in ameliorating such psychotic symptoms. Further, drugs that enhance dopamine neurotransmission in the brain cause psychotic-like episodes in man and exacerbate psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. In animal studies, drugs that increase dopamine neurotransmission cause behavioural effects such as increased locomotion, climbing and deficits in prepulse inhibition. Known antipsychotics and dopamine receptor antagonists can block these behavioural effects. Unfortunately, dopamine receptor antagonists also cause severe extrapyramidal side effects in patients as predicted by induction of catalepsy in animal models. These extrapyramidal side effects include tremor, bradykinesia, akithesias, and tardive dyskinesias.<br>
[0006] Due in part to these observations, the discovery of agents with Mi receptor agonist activity has been sought after for the treatment of dementia. However, existing agents lack specificity in their actions at the various muscarinic receptor subtypes. Known M1 muscarinic agonists such as arecoline have also been found to be weak agonists of M2 as well as M3 receptor subtypes and are ineffective in the treatment of cognitive impairment, due in large part to their dose-limiting M2 and M3 receptor mediated side effects.<br>
[0007] Xanomeline (Shannon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994, 269, 271; Shannon et al., Schizophrenia Res. 2000, 42, 249) is an M1/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist with little or no affinity for dopamine receptors despite inhibiting A10 but not A9 dopamine cells. The thiadiazole derivative PTAC has been reported (Shannon et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, 1998, 356, 109) to have partial agonist effect<br>
3<br><br>
at muscarinic M2 and M4 receptors and antagonist effect at muscarinic M1, M3, and M5 receptors as well as exhibiting functional dopamine antagonism.<br>
[0008] Recently, muscarinic agonists including xanomeline have been shown to be active in animal models with similar profiles to known antipsychotic drugs, but without causing catalepsy (Bymaster et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998, 356, 109, Bymaster et al., Life Sci. 1999, 64, 527, Shannon et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999, 290, 901, Shannon et al., Schizophrenia Res. 2000, 42, 249). Further, xanomeline was shown to reduce psychotic behavioural symptoms such as delusions, suspiciousness, vocal outbursts, and hallucinations in Alzheimer's disease patients (Bodick et al., Arch. Neurol. 1997, 54, 465), however treatment induced side effects that severely limit the clinical utility of this compound.<br>
[0009] Analogues of 1,2,5-thiadiazole have been reported (Sauerberg et al, J. Med Chem. 1998, 41, 4378) to have high affinity and selectivity for central muscarinic receptors as well as exhibiting functional dopamine antagonism despite lack of affinity for dopamine receptors.<br>
[0010] The present investigators have, in part, focussed their efforts on the development of molecules that simultaneously reduced the positive symptoms and improved the negative symptoms and the cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia as a novel treatment of mental disorders. It is the intent of the present investigators to demonstrate that muscarinic M1 and/or M4 agonists with combined D2 antagonist activity may possess superior antipsychotic efficacy without the side effects associated with high dose D2 antagonism alone. The D2 antagonist properties of some of the compounds of the present invention may contribute to a reduction in the positive symptoms of this disease.<br>
[0011] Based on distribution of M1 and M4 receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (the areas involved in higher order cognitive functions), the M1 and/or M4 agonist properties of these compounds may reduce the cognitive dulling and perhaps ameliorate other negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. (Friedman, Biol. Psychiatry, 1999, 45, 1; Rowley, J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, All; Felder, J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4333). This unique combination of central nervous system activities in one molecule is unprecedented and may lead to the development of an entirely new class of antipsychotic drugs, ones with the superior clinical properties without the limiting side-effect profile.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0024] For the purpose of the current disclosure, the following definitions shall in their entireties be used to define technical terms.<br>
7<br><br>
[0025] The term "agonist" is defined as a compound that increases the activity of a receptor when it contacts the receptor.<br>
[0026] The term "antagonist" is defined as a compound that competes with an agonist or inverse agonist for binding to a receptor, thereby inhibiting or blocking the action of an agonist or inverse agonist on the receptor. However, an antagonist (also known as a "neutral" antagonist) has no effect on constitutive receptor activity.<br>
[0027] The term "inverse agonist" is defined as a compound that decreases the basal activity of a receptor (i.e., signaling mediated by the receptor). Such compounds are also known as negative antagonists. An inverse agonist is a ligand for a receptor that causes the receptor to adopt an inactive state relative to a basal state occurring in the absence of any ligand. Thus, while an antagonist can inhibit the activity of an agonist, an inverse agonist is a ligand that can alter the conformation of the receptor in the absence of an agonist. The concept of an inverse agonist has been explored by Bond et al. in Nature 374:272 (1995). More specifically, Bond et al. have proposed that unliganded β 2-adrenoceptor exists in an equilibrium between an inactive conformation and a spontaneously active conformation. Agonists are proposed to stabilize the receptor in an active conformation. Conversely, inverse agonists are believed to stabilize an inactive receptor conformation. Thus, while an antagonist manifests its activity by virtue of inhibiting an agonist, an inverse agonist can additionally manifest its activity in the absence of an agonist by inhibiting the spontaneous conversion of an unliganded receptor to an active conformation.<br>
[0028] The "M1-receptor" is defined as a receptor having an activity corresponding to the activity of the ml muscarinic receptor subtype characterized through molecular cloning and pharmacology.<br>
[0029] The term "subject" refers to an animal, for example a mammal, such as a human, who is the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
[0030] The term "selective" is defined as a property of a compound whereby an amount of the compound sufficient to effect a desired response from a particular receptor type, subtype, class or subclass causes a substantially smaller or no effect upon the activity of other receptor types.<br>
[0031] The EC50 for an agonist is intended to denote the concentration of a compound needed to achieve 50% of a maximal response seen in an in vitro assay such as R-SAT.    For inverse agonists, EC50 is intended to denote the concentration of a<br>
8<br><br>
compound needed to achieve 50% inhibition of an R-SAT response from basal, no compound, levels.<br>
[0032] As used herein, the term "coadministration" of pharmacologically active compounds refers to the delivery of two or more separate chemical entities, whether in vitro or in vivo. Coadministration refers to the simultaneous delivery of separate agents; to the simultaneous delivery of a mixture of agents; as well as to the delivery of one agent followed by delivery of a second agent or additional agents. In all cases, agents that are coadministered are intended to work in conjunction with each other.<br>
[0033] In the present context, the term "C1-6-alkyl" means a linear or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain wherein the longest chain has from one to six carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, and hexyl.<br>
[0034] In the present context, the term "C2-8-alkenyl" means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group having from two to eight carbon atoms and containing one or more double bonds. Illustrative examples of C2-8-alkenyl groups include allyl, homo-allyl, vinyl, crotyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, heptenyl and octenyl. Illustrative examples of C2-8-alkenyl groups with more than one double bond include butadienyl, pentadienyl, hexadienyl, heptadienyl, heptatrienyl and octatrienyl groups as well as branched forms of these. The position of the unsaturation (the double bond) may be at any position along the carbon chain.<br>
[0035] In the present context the term " C2-8-alkynyl" means a linear or branched hydrocarbon group containing from two to eight carbon atoms and containing one or more triple bonds. Illustrative examples of C2-8-alkynyl groups include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, heptynyl and octynyl groups as well as branched forms of these. The position of unsaturation (the triple bond) may be at any position along the carbon chain. More than one bond may be unsaturated such that the " C2-8-alkynyl" is a di-yne or enedi-yne as is known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
[0036] In the present context, the term "C3-8-cycloalkyl" includes three-, four-, five-, six-, seven-, and eight-membered rings comprising carbon atoms only, whereas the term "heterocyclyl" means three-, four-, five-, six- seven-, and eight-membered rings wherein carbon atoms together with from 1 to 3 heteroatoms constitute said ring. The heteroatoms of such heterocyclyl groups are independently selected from oxygen, sulphur, and nitrogen.<br>
9<br><br>
[0037] The term "Heterocyclyl" groups may further contain one or more carbonyl or thiocarbonyl functionalities, so as to make the definition include oxo-systems and thio-systems such as lactams, lactones, cyclic imides, cyclic thioimides, cyclic carbamates, and the like.<br>
[0038] C3-8-cycloalkyl and heterocyclyl rings may optionally contain one or more unsaturated bonds situated in such a way, however, that an aromatic 7t-electron system does not arise.<br>
[0039] Heterocyclyl rings may optionally also be fused to aryl rings, such that the definition includes bicyclic structures. Examples of such fused heterocyclyl groups share one bond with an optionally substituted benzene ring. Examples of benzo-fused heterocyclyl groups include, but are not limited to, benzimidazolidinone, tetrahydroquinoline, and methylenedioxybenzene ring structures.<br>
[0040] Illustrative examples of " C3-8-cycloalkyl" are the carbocycles cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclopentene, cyclopentadiene, cyclohexane, cyclohexene, 1,3-cyclohexadiene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene, cycloheptane, cycloheptene, 1,2-cycloheptadiene, 1,3-cycloheptadiene, 1,4-cycloheptadiene and 1,3,5 cycloheptatriene.<br>
[0041] Illustrative examples of "heterocyclyls" are the heterocycles tetrahydrothiopyran, 4H/-pyran, tetrahydropyran, piperidine, 1,3-dioxin, 1,3-dioxane, 1,4-dioxin, 1,4-dioxane, piperazine, 1,3-oxathiane, 1,4-oxathiin, 1,4-oxathiane, tetrahydro-1,4-thiazine, 2H-l,2-oxazine , maleimide, succinimide, barbituric acid, thiobarbituric acid, dioxopiperazine, hydantoin, dihydrouracil, morpholine, trioxane, hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine, tetrahydrothiophene, tetrahydrofuran, pyrroline, pyrrolidine, pyrrolidone, pyrrolidione, pyrazoline, pyrazolidine, imidazoline, imidazolidine, 1,3-dioxole, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,3-dithiole, 1,3-dithiolane, isoxazoline, isoxazolidine, oxazoline, oxazolidine, thiazoline, thiazolidine, 1,3-oxathiolane,. Binding to the heterocycle may be at the position of a heteroatom or via a carbon atom of the heterocycle, or, for benzo-fused derivatives, via a carbon of the benzenoid ring.<br>
[0042] In the present context the term "aryl" means a carbocyclic aromatic ring or ring system. Moreover, the term "aryl" includes fused ring systems wherein at least two aryl rings, or at least one aryl and at least one C3-8--cycloalkyl share at least one chemical bond. Illustrative examples of "aryl" rings include optionally substituted phenyl, naphthalenyl, phenanthrenyl, anthracenyl, tetralinyl, fluorenyl, indenyl, and indanyl.

[0052] The method of the invention relates to the modulation of a cholinergic receptor. Typically, said cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic receptor; one example of a cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic receptor of M1-receptor subtype. As can be seen from the Examples, in suitable embodiments, the cholinergic receptor may be either or both the muscarinic Mi-receptor and the muscarinic M4-receptor subtypes. The physiologically beneficial response in the method of the invention is typically associated with the specific activation of the M1-receptor subtype over the M2- or M3-receptor subtype, or the specific activation of the M1-and M4- receptor subtypes over the M2- or M3-receptor subtype. Moreover, a physiologically beneficial response in a method of the invention is typically associated with the agonistic activity of the compound of formula I or IA. Thus, in one embodiment, the compound of formula I or IA is a muscarinic agonist, such as an Mi agonist or an M1 and M4 agonist.<br>
[0053] A further aspect of the invention relates to a method of increasing the activity of a cholinergic receptor. In one embodiment, a method includes contacting a cholinergic receptor or a system containing a cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound of formula I or IA, as defined supra.<br>
[0054] A related aspect of the invention is directed to a method of treating or preventing or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with a disorder in a mammal, such as a human. In one embodiment, a method includes the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I or IA, said disorder associated with a muscarinic receptor, for example, M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.<br>
[0055] The disorders associated with the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype are typically mental disorders. Suitable mental disorders which can be treated by the method of the invention may be selected from the group comprising of cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, and increased intraocular pressure.<br>
[0056] Disorders associated with the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype need not be a mental disorder. For instance, increased intraocular pressure is associated with the Mi muscarinic receptor subtype. Disorders to which the method of the invention are directed therefore include non-mental disorders.<br>
13<br><br>
[0057] Disorders to which the method of the invention are directed may be further selected from the group comprising neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, attention-deficit disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and glaucoma.<br>
[0058] As stated, the compounds of the invention have high selectivity and affinity for the muscarinic Mi receptor subtypes. As can be seen from the Examples, the compounds also have high affinity for one or both of the M1 and M4 receptor subtypes, selectively over other receptors such as the M2, M3 and M5 receptor subtypes. The compounds of the invention typically act, at least in part, as an M1 agonist or as Mi and M4 agonist.<br>
[0059] The compounds of the invention also have an affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor. As discussed supra in connection with the dopamine hypothesis in relation to schizophrenia, compounds which act as both muscarinic agonists and dopamine antagonists may be keys to adequately treat many mental disorders. Thus, the invention is also directed to methods of treating mental disorders, using compounds of the invention, said compounds acting as a D2 antagonist or D2 inverse agonist as well as a muscarinic agonist, particularly an M1 agonist or as M1 and M4 agonist. Thus, the method of the invention may be such that the disease in a mental disorder and the physiologically beneficial response to due to modulation in terms of M1 agonism; M1 and M4 agonism; both M1 agonism and D2 antagonism; or M1 and M4 agonism and D2 antagonism.<br>
[0060] In one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are antipsychotic agents, said anti-psychotic activity due to the compounds of the invention acting as Mi agonist; or as M1 and M4 agonists; or acting as an both Mi agonists and D2 antagonist; or as M1 and M4 agonists and D2 antagonists.<br>
[0061] Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula IA, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising either entity, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of diseases or disorders associated with a cholinergic receptor or ligand thereof. The medicament may be for the treatment of diseases associated with the receptors as discussed supra and for disorders as discussed supra. A related aspect of the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a compound<br>
14<br><br>
of formula I, as defined supra, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, a stereoisomer thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising either entity, together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>

[0063] The present investigators have found that the compounds of the invention have a high affinity and specificity for the M1 muscarinic receptor. The compounds of the invention may be of use in an array of conditions associated with the modulation of the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.<br>

R1 can be selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted C1-6-alkyl, optionally substituted C1-6-alkylidene, optionally substituted C2-6-alkenyl, optionally substituted O- C1-6-alkyl. R1 can typically be selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted C1-6-alkyl, optionally substituted C1-6-alkylidene, and optionally substituted O- C1-6-alkyl. Most typically, R1 is selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted C4-alkyl, optionally substituted C5-alkyl, optionally substituted C4-alkylidene, and optionally substituted O- C1-6-alkyl. In a preferred embodiment, R1 may be unsubstituted C4-alkyl, unsubstituted C5-alkyl, or unsubstituted O-C3-alkyl, e.g. n-butyl, n-pentyl, , or n-propyloxy.<br>
[0065] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula I are such that R1 is an optionally substituted C1-6-alkyl, selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted C1-6-alkyl, and C1-6-alkoxyalkyl. The C1-6-alkoxyalkyl may be C1-3-alkoxyC1-3-alkyl. Typically, the C1-6-alkoxyalkyl is selected from methoxypropyl, ethoxyethyl, propyloxymethyl, and methoxyethyl.<br>
[0066] In one embodiment of the invention, the compounds of formula I are piperidines, bicyclic piperidines, 3-4-unsaturated piperidines or bicyclic 3-4-unsaturated piperidines. Within this embodiment, the C3-C4 bond may be a single bond to form either a piperidine ring or a bicylic piperidine. Alternatively, piperidine may be 3-4 unsaturated.<br>
16<br><br>
That is to say that C3-C4 may be a double bond (C3=C4) so as to form either a 3-4-unsaturated piperidine or bicylic 3-4-unsaturated piperidine.<br>
[0067] In another embodiment of the invention, m is 0 and C3 is absent while C4 is CH, so as to result in an azetidine ring. Bicyclic analogues of azetidine are also included.<br>
[0068] In an alternative embodiment, m is 0 so as to result in a pyrrolidine ring or a 3-pyrroline, when C3-C4 is a single bond or a double bond, respectively. Bicyclic analogues of pyrrolidine ring or a 3-pyrroline are further included. In a further suitable embodiment, m is 2 so as to form a 7-membered ring. In a particular embodiment, m is 1.<br>

R2 is a 4-butylazetidine.<br>
[0080] In one aspect of the invention a 3-carbon tether is linking the two nitrogen atoms of the two ring systems of the compounds of formula I. The present investigators have found that this optionally substituted propylene spacer unit provides for compounds with highly efficacious binding capacity to the cholinergic receptors. More specifically, the compounds of the invention show agonistic properties at cholinergic receptors, especially muscarinic receptors.<br>

[0085] Typically, when one of the substituents R4 is C1-6-alkyl, O- C1-6-alkyl, or halogen, the tether is a 2-substituted-1,3-propylene group.<br>
[0086] In a further suitable embodiment, the tether is a 2,2-disubstituted-l,3-propylene group, in which one of R4 and one of R are typically C1-6-alkyl or fluoro.<br>
[0087] Certain embodiments of the invention, wherein the propylene tether carries one or more substituents possess a stereogenic atom in the propylene tether. As set forth in the Examples, such chiral compounds may be preferred either in racemic or enantiomerically enriched form. Pure enantiomers and racemates are both included in the invention.<br>

[0134] In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of treating a disease in a mammal, wherein modulation of the activity of a cholinergic receptor is associated with a physiologically beneficial response in said disease of said mammal, said method comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of formula (I).<br><br>
[0135] In some embodiments, the cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic receptor.<br>
[0136] In some embodiments, the cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic M1-receptor subtype.<br>
[0137] In some embodiments, the cholinergic receptor is the muscarinic M4-receptor subtype.<br>
36<br><br>
[0138] In some embodiments, the physiologically beneficial response is associated with the selective modulation of the muscarinic Mi-receptor subtype in relation to the muscarinic M2- or M3-receptor subtypes.<br>
[0139]       In some embodiments, the compound is a muscarinic agonist.<br>
[0140] In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of increasing an activity of a cholinergic receptor comprising contacting the cholinergic receptor or a system containing the cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I).<br>
[0141] In another aspect, disclosed herein is a method of treating or preventing or alleviating the symptoms associated with a disorder in a mammal, comprising the administration of an effective amount of at least one compound of formula (I), said disorder associated with a muscarinic receptor, such as M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.<br>
[0142] In some embodiments, the disorder is selected from the group consisting of cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, and increased intraocular pressure.<br>
[0143] In some embodiments, the disorder is selected from the group consisting of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Downs Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, attention-deficit disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and glaucoma.<br>
[0144] In some embodiments, the disease or disorder is a mental disorder and the physiologically beneficial response is due to modulation in terms of M1 agonism; M1 and M4 agonism; both M1 agonism and D2 antagonism; or M1 and M4 agonism and D2 antagonism.<br>
[0145] The compounds of the invention have the ability to increase cholinergic receptor activity or activate cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptor activity includes signaling activity or any other activity that is directly or indirectly related to cholinergic signalling or activation. The cholinergic receptors include muscarinic receptors, especially the ml or m4 subtype of muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic receptor can be, for example, in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal system, heart, endocrine glands, or lungs. The muscarinic receptor can be a wild-type, truncated, mutated, or modified cholinergic receptor.<br>
37<br><br>
[0146] Kits comprising the compounds of the present invention, and instructions for practicing a method of the invention, for example, increasing cholinergic receptor activity or activating cholinergic receptors, are also provided.<br>
[0147] The system containing the cholinergic receptor may, for example, be a subject such as a mammal, non-human primate or a human. The system may also be an in vivo or in vitro experimental model, such as a cell culture model system that expresses a cholinergic receptor, a cell-free extract thereof that contains a cholinergic receptor, or a purified receptor. Non-limiting examples of such systems are tissue culture cells expressing the receptor, or extracts or lysates thereof.<br>
[0148] Cells that may be used in a method of the invention include any cell capable of mediating signal transduction via cholinergic receptors, such as the ml muscarinic receptor, either via endogenous expression of receptor (certain types of neuronal cells lines, for example, natively express the ml receptor), or such as following introduction of an exogenous gene into the cell, for example, by transfection of cells with plasmids containing the receptor gene. Such cells are typically mammalian cells (or other eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells or Xenopus oocytes), because cells of lower life forms generally lack the appropriate signal transduction pathways for the present purpose. Specific non-limiting examples of suitable cells include: the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL 1658), which responds to transfected ml receptors by increased growth; RAT 1 cells (Pace et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7031-35 (1991)); and pituitary cells (Vallar et al., Nature 330:556-58 (1987)). Other useful mammalian cells include but are not limited to HEK 293 cells, CHO cells and COS cells.<br>
[0149] The compounds of the present invention also have the ability to reduce intraocular pressure and therefore can be used in the treatment of such diseases associated with intraocular pressure, e.g., glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease in which an abnormality is observed in the circulation-control mechanism of the aqueous humor filling up the anterior chamber, i.e., the space formed between the cornea and the lens. This leads to an increase in the volume of the aqueous humor and an increase in intraocular pressure, consequently leading to visual field defects and even to loss of eyesight due to the compulsion and contraction of the papillae of the optic nerve.<br>
[0150] Accordingly, the invention also provides methods of treating a disease in a mammal, such as a human, wherein modulation of the activity of a cholinergic receptor is associated with a physiologically beneficial response in said disease of said<br>
38<br><br>
mammal. In one embodiment, a method includes administering an effective amount of a compound of formula I, as defined supra, to achieve a physiologically beneficial response. Typically, the cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic receptor, more typically the cholinergic receptor is a muscarinic M1-receptor subtype. Alternatively, the cholinergic receptor is the muscarinic M4-receptor subtype.<br>
[0151] The invention further provides methods of treating or preventing or alleviating the symptoms associated with a disorder in a mammal, such as a human. In one embodiment, a method includes the administration of an effective amount of the compound of formula I, said disorder associated with a muscarinic receptor, such as the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype, to treat or prevent or alleviate one or more symptoms associated with the disorder.<br>
[0152] The physiologically beneficial response is typically associated with the selective modulation of the muscarinic Mi-receptor subtype in relation to the muscarinic M2- or M3-receptor subtypes. In one embodiment, the compound in the method of the invention is a muscarinic agonist.<br>
[0153] The disease or disorder treated by the compounds of the invention is typically a mental disorder and the physiologically beneficial response is due to modulation in terms of M1 agonism; M1 and M4 agonism; both M1 agonism and D2 antagonism; or M1 and M4 agonism and D2 antagonism.<br>
[0154] A further and related aspect of the invention relates to methods of increasing an activity of a cholinergic receptor. In one embodiment, a method includes contacting the cholinergic receptor or a system containing the cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound as defined supra to increase an activity of a cholinergic receptor.<br>
[0155] As can be ascertained from the above discussion, the compounds of the invention are intended, at least in part, for use as pharmaceutical medicaments. Thus, the invention provides compositions comprising i) one or more compounds of formula I, as defined supra; and ii) at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier. As the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula I, as defined supra, the invention also provides a compound of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a stereoisomer thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising either entity, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of diseases or disorders associated with a cholinergic receptor or ligand thereof.<br>
39<br><br>
[0156] The invention thus relates, in part, to a method of treating or preventing or alleviating one or more symptoms associated with a disorder in a mammal, such as a human. In one embodiment, a method includes the administration of an effective amount of the compound of formula I, said disorder associated with a muscarinic receptor, such as the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype, to prevent or alleviate one or more symptoms. Disorders include those selected from the group consisting of cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, and increased intraocular pressure. Disorders also include those selected from the group consisting of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Downs Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, attention-deficit disorder, sudden infant death syndrome, and glaucoma. Consequently, the invention further relates to a use of a compound of formula I, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a stereoisomer thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising either entity, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of diseases or disorders including those selected from the group consisting of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's chorea, Friederich's ataxia, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Pick disease, dementia, clinical depression, age-related cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, depression, pain, sleep disorders, psychosis, sudden infant death syndrome, increased intraocular pressure and glaucoma.<br>
[0157] Compounds according to the invention may be used alone at appropriate dosages defined by routine testing in order to obtain optimal pharmacological effect on a muscarinic receptor, in particular the muscarinic Mi or M4 receptor subtype, while minimizing any potential toxic or otherwise unwanted effects. In addition, coadministration or sequential administration of other agents that improve the effect of the compound may, in some cases, be desirable.<br>
[0158] The pharmacological properties and selectivity of the compounds of the invention for specific muscarinic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of different assay methods using, for example, recombinant receptor subtypes, the human receptors as available, e.g., conventional second messenger or binding assays. A particularly convenient functional assay system is the receptor selection and amplification<br>
40<br><br>
assay (R-SAT assay) in U.S. Patent No. 5,707,798, which describes a method of screening for bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the different muscarinic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand of the receptor. Cell amplification is detected as increased levels of a marker also expressed by the cells.<br>
