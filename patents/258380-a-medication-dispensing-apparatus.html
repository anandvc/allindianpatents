The present invention relates to a medication dispensing apparatus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to medication dispensing devices, and, in<br>
particular, to a portable medication dispensing device such as an injector pen.<br>
Patients suffering from a number of different diseases frequently must inject<br>
themselves with medication. To allow a person to conveniently and accurately self-<br>
administer medicine, a variety of devices broadly known as injector pens or<br>
injection pens have been developed. Generally, these pens are equipped with a<br>
cartridge including a piston and containing a multi-dose quantity of liquid<br>
medication. A drive member, extending from within a base of the injector pen and<br>
operably connected with typically more rearward mechanisms of the pen that<br>
control drive member motion, is movable forward to advance the piston in the<br>
cartridge in such a manner to dispense the contained medication from an outlet at<br>
the opposite cartridge end, typically through a needle that penetrates a stopper at<br>
that opposite end. In disposable pens, after a pen has been utilized to exhaust the<br>
supply of medication within the cartridge, the entire pen is discarded by a user, who<br>
then begins using a new replacement pen. In reusable pens, after a pen has been<br>
utilized to exhaust the supply of medication within the cartridge, the pen is<br>
disassembled to allow replacement of the spent cartridge with a fresh cartridge, and<br>
then the pen is reassembled for its subsequent use.<br>
Some injector pens allow a dose to be set that is larger than the amount of<br>
useable medicine remaining in the pen. While some users may find such settability<br>
undesirable, providing an insufficient remaining dose indicator may not be practical<br>
in all cases, such as due to it complicating the pen design. Still further, a<br>
shortcoming with some injector pens is that the design platform on which they are<br>
based may not allow a manufacturer sufficient options as to the mechanical<br>
advantage to provide, such as a mechanical advantage that can be very small in<br>
order to readily inject a large volume dose, or which mechanical advantage can be<br>
quite large so as to deliver a small volume dose with a suitable plunger travel.<br><br>
Thus, it would be desirable to provide an apparatus that can overcome one or<br>
more of these and other shortcomings of the prior art.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one form thereof, the present invention provides a medication dispensing<br>
apparatus including a housing, a drive member within the housing and movable in a<br>
distal direction, a fluid container defining a medicine-filled reservoir with a movable<br>
piston at one end and an outlet at the other end, the piston being engageable by the drive<br>
member to be advanced toward the outlet a distance equal to a distal movement of the<br>
drive member when the drive member is moved distally, a means for driving the drive<br>
member distally, and a latching element including a latching lip and a skid. The drive<br>
member includes an axially extending, skid-engaging surface along which the skid is<br>
slidable as the drive member passes distally during advancement. The skid-engaging<br>
surface has an axial length and a proximal end, and the drive member along the axial<br>
length is structured and arranged with the skid so as to maintain the latching lip against a<br>
spring force in a first position free of the driving means during dose preparing and<br>
injecting prior to a final dose administration. The skid-engaging surface shifts distally of<br>
the skid such that the skid passes beyond the proximal end upon administration of a final<br>
dose, whereby the latching lip is urged by the spring force from the first position to a<br>
second position to physically lock the driving means to prevent further dose preparing<br>
and injecting.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that a medication dispensing apparatus<br>
can be provided with an uncomplicated and robust mechanism for automatically locking<br>
the apparatus to prevent further use after a final dose of the apparatus has been<br>
administered.<br>
Yet another advantage of the present invention is that a medication dispensing<br>
apparatus can be provided which is readily adaptable by the manufacturer to furnish a<br>
mechanical advantage during dose administration selected from a wide range of such<br>
advantages, such as a small advantage of about two for a large volume dose, up to a large<br>
advantage of about sixteen for a small volume dose.<br><br>
Another advantage of the present invention is that a medication dispensing<br>
apparatus can be provided which is internally configured to utilize space efficiently to<br>
allow for a compact design that contributes to a small and symmetrical design of the<br>
apparatus.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1-12, there is shown a first embodiment of a medication<br>
dispensing apparatus of the present invention. Any directional references in this detailed<br>
description with respect to Fig. 1 or any of the other Figures, such as front, side or back,<br>
or up or down, or top or bottom, are intended for convenience of description, and by<br>
itself does not limit the present invention or any of its components to any particular<br>
positional or spatial orientation.<br>
The apparatus, generally designated 20, is an injector pen of a design that builds<br>
upon the teachings of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 60/557,545, which also was<br>
filed with the United States Receiving Office of the World Intellectual Property<br>
Organization and assigned application number	on even date with the<br><br>
international filing of this application, the entire contents of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference. Medication injector pen 20 is a disposable pen that is<br>
repeatedly operable by a user to deliver a fixed dose that is established by the pen<br>
manufacturer.<br>
The distal portion 22 of injector pen 20 includes a plastic tubular retainer 24 that<br>
holds a cartridge 28 therein. Cartridge 28 is of conventional design, including a<br>
medicine-filled reservoir 30 sealed at one end by a slidable piston 32 and sealed at the<br>
other end by an injection needle-pierceable septum 33. Retainer 24 is made of a clear<br>
plastic material to allow a user to see the contents of reservoir 30. Threading 26 on the<br>
stepped-down distal end of retainer 24 allow a releaseably mounting of, for example, a<br>
conventional injection needle assembly shown at 25. Pen 20 is shown in Figs. 4 and 5 as<br>
having a protective cap 29 that removably mounts to the cartridge retainer 24 for<br>
protection thereof, which cap has a distal end design at 31 to prevent the capped pen<br>
from rolling.<br>
The proximal portion 34 of injector pen 20 includes a protective external housing<br>
35 that is somewhat elliptical in transverse cross-section. To facilitate assembly of the<br>
apparatus, housing 35 is formed from multiple, interconnected injection molded plastic<br>
pieces. Housing 35 is shown having longitudinal halves 36 and 38 that are<br>
complementarity designed to mate and be fixedly secured together during manufacture,<br>
such as via ultrasonic welding.<br>
The interior surfaces 37 and 39 of housing halves 36 and 38, respectively, are<br>
shown formed with a variety of ribs and bulkheads that serve to maintain the alignment<br>
and guide the motion of the apparatus components disposed within housing 35. Housing<br>
halves 36 and 38 respectively include distally projecting, curved flanges 40 and 42.<br>
During apparatus manufacture, to mount the fluid container to the assembled housing,<br>
flanges 40 and 42 are first inserted within the proximal end of retainer 24 radially<br>
outward of the cartridge body, and then fixedly secured to the retainer, such as via<br>
adhesives or ultrasonic welding. When retainer 24 and housing 35 are so secured,<br>
cartridge 28 is axially sandwiched between the interior surface of retainer 24 and an<br>
internal bulkhead 44 of the housing to prevent axial movement of the cartridge during<br>
use.<br><br>
Pen proximal portion 34 includes an axially advanceable drive member generally<br>
designated 50, a gear set generally designated 52, and a plunger member generally<br>
designated 54.<br>
Drive member 50 includes a cartridge-engaging piece 60 and a pinion-engaging<br>
piece 62, each injection molded in a single piece from plastic. Cartridge-engaging piece<br>
60 has a square rod-shaped body 64 that extends in the axial direction to a proximal end<br>
65, and a load distributing, disc-shaped portion 66 formed at the distal end of body 64.<br>
Four angularly spaced, contoured gussets 68 span body 64 and disc 66.<br>
Drive member pieces 60 and 62 are constrained by the interior surfaces of<br>
housing halves 36 and 38 to be axially translatable and rotatably fixed within the<br>
housing. Cartridge-engaging piece 60 is movable in the distal direction and prevented<br>
from proximal movement relative to the housing halves, while pinion-engaging piece 62<br>
is clutchably connected to cartridge-engaging piece 60 to be moveable relative thereto in<br>
a proximal direction but not the distal direction. These one-way axial motions are<br>
achieved with ratchets in apparatus 20. In particular, body 64 of cartridge-engaging piece<br>
60 includes a row of one-way ramping ratchet teeth 70 on two opposite sides of its four<br>
sides, which teeth continue uninterrupted along a portion of the axial length of the body.<br>
Ratchet teeth 70 are engaged by a pair of diametrically opposed, resilient tabs or pawls<br>
72 integrally formed with housing half 38. Pawls 72 slide along and over teeth 70 when<br>
drive member piece 60 is advanced distally during use, but abut the transverse, proximal<br>
face of teeth 70 to prevent piece 60 from backing up in the proximal direction.<br>
Proximally of pawls 72, a pair of diametrically opposed resilient pawls 75 of<br>
pinion-engaging piece 62 also engage the same rows of ratchet teeth 70 on opposite sides<br>
of body 64. Pawls 75 slide along and over one or more teeth 70 when pinion-engaging<br>
piece 62 is moved proximally during pen cocking, but abut teeth 70 during the distal<br>
advancement of pinion-engaging piece 62 during injection, which abutting results in<br>
pinion-engaging piece 62 shifting distally the cartridge-engaging piece 60. The pitch or<br>
distance between the transverse face of each adjacent tooth 70 preferably is the distance<br>
piston 32 needs to be advanced to deliver the pen's fixed dose.<br>
In addition to its pawls 75, pinion-engaging piece 62 includes a plate-shaped body<br>
77. A longitudinally extending rack 80 projects from one side of body 77. A pair of<br><br>
parallel, longitudinally extending ribs 82 project from the opposite side of body 77 and<br>
slidable receive rod-shaped body 64 therebetween. Another set of parallel rib portions 83<br>
are shaped to slide along a ridge 45 formed on the interior surface 39 of housing half 38.<br>
A fixed or axially stationary rack 84 is included within pen proximal portion 24.<br>
Rack 84 is shown intergrally formed with housing half 38.<br>
Plunger member 54 allows a user to control the internal gear set of the apparatus<br>
to prepare pen 20 for injection, as well as to perform the injection. Plunger member 54 is<br>
formed of a multi-piece construction, including an input element 90, a button 92, and a<br>
force limiting biasing member 94.<br>
Button 92 is molded from plastic and externally sized and shaped to be rotatably<br>
fixed while slideable within housing 35. An internal hollow 93 of button 92<br>
accommodates a biasing member 94 axially extending therethrough, and a series of<br>
longitudinally extending, internal ribs 95 of button 92 maintain the alignment of biasing<br>
member 94. The proximal end of button 92 is covered with a softer material shown at<br>
97, which is formed via an overmolding process. A manually pullable grip portion 96 of<br>
button 92 is covered with the soft touch material and extends proximally of the housing<br>
35. Flanges 98 laterally extend from the distal end of button 92 and, during pen cocking,<br>
abut inward lips 100 formed in housing halves 36, 38 to limit withdrawal of the plunger<br>
member from the housing. An indicating band 102 on button 92 is visible to a user when<br>
the button has been properly withdrawn to prepare pen 20 for medication delivery.<br>
Button 92 also includes a pair of diametrically opposed latches 101 at the distal ends of<br>
slot-defined fingers 103. Latches 101 inwardly project within hollow 93, and due to the<br>
resiliency of the fingers 103, snap-fit during manufacturing assembly over transversely<br>
extending shoulders 105 of the input element 90 to prevent axial, proximal withdrawal of<br>
the button 92 from the input element during operation.<br>
Plunger element 90 is made of injection molded plastic and is designed in<br>
conjunction with the housing to be rotatably fixed while slideable within housing 35.<br>
Plunger element 90 includes a cruciform-shaped protuberance 107 that proximally<br>
projects from a plate portion 108. Plate portion 108 is keyed to be rotatably fixed within<br>
the button, and includes the latchable shoulders 105. Protuberance 107 fits within the<br>
distal end of the force limiting biasing member 94 provided as a metal, helically coiled<br><br>
compression spring. The proximal end of biasing member 94 fits around a cruciform-<br>
shaped protuberance 109 formed on button 92 within hollow 93. Spring 94 is captured in<br>
a pre-stressed state between the latched plate portion 108 and the interior end of button<br>
92, which pre-stressing is at least as large as forces the manufacturer expects users to<br>
apply on the plunger button during normal plunging to achieve proper pen operation. In<br>
one embodiment, in which a mechanical advantage of nominally ten to one is provided<br>
by the apparatus, the pre-stressing is in an amount of one pound. Thus, during normal<br>
plunging, spring 94 does not further compress and the button 92 and input element 90<br>
shift as a unit and without relative axial motion. Coil spring 94 is also designed with<br>
sufficient spacing in its coiling, and with proper elastic properties, such that the spring,<br>
by compression, can accommodate movement of button 92 from the cocked position to<br>
the ready-to-be-cocked position without movement of plunger element 90, whereby<br>
spring 94 can absorb plunging forces that could damage the internal components.<br>
Plunger element 90 also includes a bar portion 110 and a block portion 114 which<br>
both project distally from plate portion 108. Near its distal end, bar portion 110 includes<br>
a laterally extending portion that serves as a U-shaped bearing or yoke 116. Yoke 116<br>
extends and opens away from the pen axis. At its distal end, bar portion 110 terminates<br>
in an upstanding lip 117 with a ramped face 118. Lip 117 serves as a catch or hook of<br>
the apparatus locking mechanism. Yoke 116 receives the pin 120 of the gear set, which<br>
pin defines an axis about which the gear set partially revolves or pivots during use.<br>
Block portion 114 serves as a base to which a flexure or follower piece 122 of a partial-<br>
cocking-preventing mechanism is insert molded during manufacture.<br>
Follower piece 122 is made in one piece of a metal stamping and includes an<br>
apertured mounting plate 124 that is secured to block 114 during insert molding. A pair<br>
of resilient arms 126 longitudinally extend in parallel from mounting plate 124. Arms<br>
126 serve as leaf springs and are spanned at their distal ends by web 128. A pawl 129<br>
projects from web 128 toward housing half 36. Follower 122 directly engages a guide<br>
135 of the partial-cocking-preventing mechanism. Follower arms 126 are closely backed<br>
by ribs 82 to better ensure that pawl 129 is not twisted out of a proper engagement with<br>
the guide during use.<br><br>
Referring also now to Fig. 12, guide 135 is integrally formed with the interior<br>
surface 37 of housing half 36 and includes a bar portion 138 having an angled, distal end<br>
140 and an angled, proximal end 142. One longitudinally extending face of bar portion<br>
138 provides a flat travel surface 146, and the opposite face of the bar portion 138<br>
includes a travel surface 148 equipped with a plurality of ratchet teeth 150. Teeth 150<br>
are engageable by pawl 129 to prevent distal movement of the plunger after only a partial<br>
withdrawal of the plunger in preparation for injection. Teeth 150 can be customized<br>
during manufacture to produce the desired number and volume of clicks during<br>
movement of the pawl over the row of teeth during use. For example, the provision of a<br>
large number of teeth, each having a relatively short height over which the pawl must be<br>
cammed outward, may result in clicks that are less distinct and similar in sound to a<br>
continuous, low volume buzz. Still further, instead of triangular teeth, the teeth may be<br>
lobe-shaped, with the indentation between lobes being where pawl 129 engages to<br>
prevent distal motion. Guide 135 further includes first and second abutment shoulders<br>
152 and 154 molded into the housing.<br>
The partial-cocking-preventing mechanism in the shown embodiment provides an<br>
initial reluctance to pen cocking due to the sliding of pawl 129 over distal end 140, a<br>
tactile and audible notice of plunger movement, along with a prevention of plunger return<br>
prior to a complete dose preparation, due to the movement of pawl 129 over the row of<br>
teeth 150, an audible notice of complete dose preparation by the striking of abutment<br>
shoulder 152 by a distal end portion 130 of one resilient arm 126, an initial reluctance to<br>
injection due to the sliding of pawl 129 over proximal end 142, and an audible notice of<br>
injection completion by the striking of shoulder 154 by a distal end portion 131 of the<br>
other resilient arm 126.<br>
The gear set utilized in the injection pen is configured to convert plunger member<br>
motion of a first distance into drive member motion of a second distance less than the<br>
first distance. The gear set shown at 52 is made from a lightweight material such as<br>
plastic, and utilizes first and second sized pinions.<br>
The first or larger sized pinion 160 includes an arcuate section of external gear<br>
teeth 162 that mesh with rack 84. An arcuate section of gear teeth is all that is required<br>
due to the small angle of revolution of the pinion necessary for use of the shown pen,<br><br>
which small angle or partial roll is possible due to the nominally ten to one mechanical<br>
advantage provided by the shown gear ratio.<br>
The smaller sized pinion 166 has the same axis of rotation as pinion 160 and<br>
includes only an arcuate section of external gear teeth 168. Gear teeth 168 have a pitch<br>
diameter that is less than the pitch diameter of gear teeth 162. In the shown embodiment,<br>
such diameter is about 90% of the diameter of gear teeth 168, which ratio provides the<br>
nominally ten to one mechanical advantage. Smaller ratios may be employed, such as<br>
down to 50%, which realizes a two to one mechanical advantage, and larger ratios may<br>
alternatively be employed, such as realizing a ratio for a sixteen to one mechanical<br>
advantage. Gear teeth 168 meshably engage drive member rack 80, which rack is<br>
parallel to and disposed on the same side of the pinion axis as rack 84.<br>
Although pinion 160 and pinion 166 are shown integrally formed, these<br>
components can be separately formed and assembled together so as to be corotatable.<br>
Pinions 160 and 166 share a common axis of rotation. A pin or axle 120 is located at<br>
such axis and is shown integrally formed with the pinions. Pin 120 is sized and shaped<br>
to fit into, and pivot or partially rotate within, the opening of yoke 116 during use.<br>
During pen use, gear set 52 is shifted proximally and then distally in the<br>
following manner. The gear set is shifted axially with the plunger element 90 to which it<br>
is pinned as such plunger element is pulled out and subsequently plunged in. As gear set<br>
52 moves proximally, the gear set rotates due to pinion 160 being in rolling engagement<br>
with fixed rack 84. As gear set 52 rotates, pinion 166 rolls along drive member rack 80,<br>
but also effectively pulls for a short distance the pinion-engaging piece 62 proximally<br>
relative to the cartridge-engaging piece 60 held by the pawls 72. During plunger element<br>
plunging, pinion 160 rolls backs along rack 84, and pinion 166 rolls along rack 80 while<br>
effectively pushing pinion-engaging piece 62 to advance cartridge-engaging piece 60<br>
distally.<br>
Injection apparatus 20 includes a locking mechanism that prevents use of the<br>
apparatus after a final intended dose has been administered thereby. The locking<br>
mechanism automatically operates during the injection of such final dose to prevent the<br>
plunger from being withdrawn thereafter.<br><br>
The locking mechanism includes a generally C-shaped latching element,<br>
generally designated 180. Latching element 180 is formed in a single piece, such as a<br>
metal stamping, and includes a spring plate 182, a pair of installation flanges 184, and a<br>
latch lip 186. Flanges 184 depend from the distal edge of spring plate 182 and include<br>
lower ends 187. During pen manufacture, ends 187 press fit into complementary slots<br>
formed by wall 188 and barbed ribs 189 of the housing half 38 to assemble latching<br>
element 180 to the housing to be axially fixed relative thereto.<br>
Centrally located along the width of the plate 182 is a depending skid 190. Skid<br>
190 has a lower surface 192 that is blade-shaped and longitudinally extends. Blade 192<br>
directly contacts and slides along an axially extending, smooth surface 71 of cartridge-<br>
engaging piece 60. Skid 190 is formed by cutting and bending downward a portion of<br>
plate 182 during manufacture. An additional cut-out 194 opposite the opening formed by<br>
the bending downward of skid 190 results in a better symmetry of the plate portion 182<br>
to aid in providing a more uniform springing effect during latching. Latch lip 186<br>
depends from the proximal edge of spring plate 182 in the same direction as skid 190<br>
depends, and is proximally spaced slightly from skid 190. Skid 190 is selected to be of<br>
such a height that its engagement with bar surface 71 results in spring plate 182 being<br>
deflected upward and away from its neutral position, whereby lip 186 is laterally spaced<br>
from the plunger member 54 extending thereunder, and in particular is spaced laterally<br>
from the hook 117 of bar portion 110. During initial use, blade 192 slides along the<br>
untoothed portion of the drive member at surface 71, with latch lip 186 being spaced<br>
from the plunger against the resiliency or spring-force provided by spring plate 182.<br>
When cartridge-engaging piece 60 is driven distally to complete its final injection, blade<br>
192 slides off the proximal end 65 of smooth surface 71, allowing the resiliency of spring<br>
plate 182 to snap latch lip 186 downward. As latch lip 186 moves down, in the event<br>
that the plunger member 54 has already been fully shifted distally, the latch lip 186 fits<br>
proximally of the hook 117 of bar portion 110. In the event the shifting plunger has yet<br>
to have been shifted distally fully during the final dose administration, as the plunger<br>
motion continues the ramped face 118 engages latch lip 186 to temporarily cam latch lip<br>
186 upward, and when the plunger is moved sufficiently distally, latch lip 186 then snaps<br>
down over hook 117. This latching of latch lip 186 with hook 117 prevents any further<br><br>
proximal motion of bar portion 110, and thereby of the entire plunger member 54.<br>
Although shown directly engaging input element 90, the latching element may engage<br>
other portions of the drive mechanism within the scope of the invention.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 13, there is shown an exploded, perspective view of another<br>
embodiment of a medication dispensing apparatus of the present invention. The<br>
apparatus, generally designated 220, is substantially similar to apparatus 20, with some<br>
differences being identified below.<br>
In particular, the locking mechanism preventing use after an administration of a<br>
final intended dose includes a generally L-shaped latching element, generally designated<br>
225, formed in a single piece, such as a metal stamping. The spring plate 227 of latching<br>
element 225 includes a centered aperture 230 that defines webs 232 and 234. Depending<br>
from spring plate 227 along the proximal edge of aperture 230 is a transversely extending<br>
skid 236 having an upwardly curved lower end 238.<br>
Generally elliptical slots 242 formed through the spring plate form a pair of rims<br>
240 that each include a portion that upwardly projects beyond the top of the spring plate.<br>
Rims 240 project from the spring plate in a direction opposite to the direction skid 236<br>
projects. Rims 240 are proximally spaced from skid 236. The shown rims 240 serve as a<br>
pair of latching lips each providing a hook-contacting surface that is larger than that<br>
formed merely by the small thickness of the shown spring plate, thereby better<br>
distributing loading.<br>
The proximal edge of spring plate 227 is upturned at 244 to promote the spring<br>
plate being cammed over the locking mechanism hooks as may be necessary. Skid 236<br>
still is of a height that its engagement with the bar surface 71' results in spring plate 227<br>
being directed upward and away from its neutral position, whereby rims 240 are spaced<br>
from the apparatus plunger disposed thereunder, and in particular from the bar portion<br>
hooks.<br>
In conjunction with this modified latching element, the plunger element 260<br>
includes a pair of spaced, parallel bar portions 262, 264 that project distally from a plate<br>
portion 266. Each of bar portions 262, 264 includes a lip 266, with a ramped face 267, to<br>
serve as a rim-engaging hook of the locking mechanism when inserted through the spring<br><br>
plate openings 240. Only one of the bar portions, namely bar 262, is provided with the<br>
yoke for mounting the gear set 270.<br>
The plunger button of the embodiment of Fig. 13 is formed of two pieces, namely<br>
274 and 276, which are fixedly secured together during manufacturing assembly. Piece<br>
274 is a different color than piece 276, and the pieces 274 and 276 are sized such that the<br>
proximal end region of piece 274 serves as a colored indicating band that is visible to a<br>
user when the plunger button is fully withdrawn to prepare the pen for delivery.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 13 has a mechanical advantage of just over seven, as a<br>
ratio of the gear pitch diameters of gear set 270 is 86%.<br>
The cartridge engaging piece 280 may be designed with ratchet teeth that are<br>
adapted for an initial shipping/storage of a ready-to-be-cocked apparatus in which, while<br>
pawls 282 are each similarly situated at the start of their respective ratchet tooth (i.e<br>
proximate the transverse face of the distally adjacent tooth), both anti-back-up pawls 284<br>
are similarly partially cammed outward by their engagement with a middle length portion<br>
of different ratchet teeth. These different ratchet teeth so initially engaged by pawls 284<br>
have a shallower slope and therefore lesser height, as measured from the longitudinal<br>
axis of the apparatus, than the other teeth in the row, thereby reducing the stress on pawls<br>
284 prior to the first use of the apparatus by the user. In order to possibly account for a<br>
single test cycle by the manufacturer during assembly, two adjacent lesser height teeth in<br>
each row for engagement with pawls 284 may be provided.<br>
While this invention has been shown and described as having preferred designs,<br>
the present invention may be modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. For<br>
example, other forms of drive systems, including but not limited to drive systems<br>
providing mechanical advantage using rack and pinion designs, possibly such as<br>
disclosed in the materials herein incorporated by reference, may be utilized. For<br>
example, a gear set may have pinned to its axle an output member which engages the<br>
cartridge piston. Such gear set may have one arc of gear teeth that engage a housing<br>
rack, and another arc of gear teeth that engage a plunger rack, which racks are positioned<br>
on opposite sides of the gear set's axle. Such arcs of gear teeth may have a common<br>
pitch diameter, or the housing rack-engaging gear teeth may have a pitch diameter which<br>
is smaller or larger than the plunger rack-engaging gear teeth. Still further, in another<br><br>
version the gear set may be pinned to the housing. A plunger rack of the system may<br>
engage gear teeth of the gear set having a larger pitch diameter, and a rack of the output<br>
member which engages the cartridge piston may engage teeth of the gear set having a<br>
smaller pitch diameter. Still further, for an unpinned or rolling gear set, a plunger rack<br>
may engage gear teeth with a first pitch diameter, a rack of an output member which<br>
engages the cartridge piston may engage gear teeth with a smaller pitch diameter, and a<br>
housing rack, which is positioned on the opposite side of the gear set's center from the<br>
plunger and output racks, may engage gear teeth with a pitch diameter that is the same or<br>
smaller than that of teeth engaging the plunger rack. Still further, in a rolling gear set<br>
design related to the materials herein incorporated by reference, the plunger rack may<br>
engage teeth with a smaller pitch diameter than the pitch diameter of gear teeth engaging<br>
the housing rack. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses or<br>
adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is<br>
intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or<br>
customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains.<br><br>
