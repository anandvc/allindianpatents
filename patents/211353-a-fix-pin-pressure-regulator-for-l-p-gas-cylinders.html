				<td>This invention relates to a Fix Pin Pressure Regulator for L P Gas Cylinders.<br>
A Pressure Regulator has three main portions, namely: Atmospheric Pressure Chamber (above line BB - Sheet No.l), Low Pressure Chamber (between lines AA and BB) and High Pressure Chamber (below line AA).<br>
In the proposed invention, we have neither altered the Atmospheric Chamber nor the Low Pressure Chamber. We have mainly proposed is a replacement of the High Pressure Chamber that makes the Pressure Regulator very safe for the House wife, leak-proof, sturdy and simple in design<br>
In this invention we have eliminated the High Pressure Chamber of the PR in a manner so that no part is connected from outside to inside and that there is no moving part in our design, which operates the opening of the Cylinder Valve Pin. In short, we have eliminated the 5 moving parts and operate the cylinder valve pin from inside so that there is absolutely no chance of leakage in the High Pressure Chamber of the PR.<br>
The principal objective of this invention, therefore, is to propose a Fix Pin Pressure Regulator for L P Gas Cylinders.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In the prior art, the High Pressure Chamber of the Pressure Regulator (PR) consists of the following parts: (Please refer to Drawing Sheet 1)<br>
1	Eccentric Operating Shaft. (Moving Part) - 1<br>
2	Shaft Lock.<br>
3	Cam on Shaft to lock the PR into the Cylinder<br>
Valve. (Moving Part) - 2<br>
4	Clamping Mechanism. (Moving Part) - 3<br>
5	Rubber Gland Packing round the shaft.<br>
6	Eccentric Pin at the end of the Shaft. (Moving<br>
Part) - 4<br>
7	Inlet Stub.<br>
8	Operating Spindle. (Moving Part) - 5<br>
9	Spindle Retainer.<br>
From the above it may be noticed that in the prior art, there are five moving parts. In addition to the moving parts, the most vulnerable part of this PR is the rubber gland packing, which, after some use, gives way, and a steady leakage starts from this gland packing.<br>
It may also be noticed that in the prior art, the operation of the cylinder valve pin is done from outside by a shaft which is connected by a shaft from outside to inside that creates leakage in the long run. In case of L P gas operations, every effort should be made to minimize leakage in every operation.<br>
As far as the fix pin concept of the proposed invention is concerned, there is no prior art on this subject at all.<br>
The proposed invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
A Fix Pin Pressure Regulator for L P Gas Cylinders comprising of and characterizing in that the lower part of the Pressure Regulator Body (2) with an internal space to house the mouth of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve (7), the body having 2 slots (4) to insert a 'U' shape taper lever (11) that goes in between the L P Gas Cylinder Valve Collar (6) and the body slots (4), the said body having a stub (9) that connects gas tight into the mouth of the Cylinder Valve (7), the stub having a fixed pin (3) at the lower end and 2 holes in 'Y' shape (5) for the L P gas to flow freely from the Cylinder Valve (7) to the Lower Pressure Chamber of the Pressure Regulator (10).<br>
The function and operation of the proposed invention is now described with reference to the accompanying drawings:<br>
In the Drawing Sheet No. 1 below the marked line AA, shows the complicated High Pressure Chamber of the Prior Art Pressure Regulators.<br>
This includes, Eccentric Operating Shaft. (Moving Part), Shaft Lock, Cam on Shaft to lock the PR into the Cylinder Valve. (Moving Part), Clamping Mechanism. (Moving Part), Rubber Gland Packing round the shaft, Eccentric Pin at the end of the Shaft. (Moving Part), Inlet Stub, Operating Spindle (Moving Part) and Spindle Retainer.<br>
Drawing Sheet No. 2 shows a simple diagram of the proposed invention.<br>
Drawing sheet No. 3 shows the complete details of the proposed invention with L P Gas Cylinder Valve in position.<br>
OPERATION<br>
Put the lower part of the Pressure Regulator Body (2) on top of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve (7). The cylinder Valve will go into the lower body of the Pressure Regulator.<br>
Now insert the taper 'U' shape lever (11) between the slots in the body (4) and the below the Cylinder Valve Collar (6). In this operation the Stub (9) will become gas tight with the L P Gas Cylinder Valve (7) and the fixed pin in the stub (3) will be just above the Cylinder Valve Pin (1).<br>
Push the 'U' shape lever (11) further into the slots (4) and by the taper of the lever the cylinder Valve (7) will be pushed upwards thereby the fix pin of the stub (3) will press the cylinder Valve Pin (1) downwards. As soon as the Cylinder Valve Pin (1) is pushed downwards, L P Gas will start flowing from the L P Gas Cylinder Valve (7) to the Pressure Regulator through the 'Y' shape holes (5).<br>
For stopping the flow of the gas, just pull the 'U' shape lever (11) out and the fix pin of the stub (3) will be lifted above the Cylinder Valve Pin (1) and the flow of gas will stop.<br>
Although a specific embodiment of the proposed invention is discussed above, it should be appreciated that many modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. The proposed invention (mainly the Fix Pin concept for connection) can also be applied to so many other equipments such as, all types of L P Gas Leak Detectors, L P Gas Leakage Measurers, PR Testers, L P Gas adaptors, L P Gas Filling Guns and the like.<br>
All such modifications to this invention and applications of this invention in other equipments are intended to be included within the scope of this proposed invention, which is limited by the proceeding claims:<br><br><br><br>
I claim:<br>
1	A Fix Pin Pressure Regulator for L P Gas Cylinders<br>
comprising of and characterizing in that the lower part of<br>
the Pressure Regulator Body (2) with an internal space to<br>
house the mouth of the L P Gas Cylinder Valve (7), the<br>
body having 2 slots (4) to insert a 'U' shape taper lever (11)<br>
that goes in between the L P Gas Cylinder Valve Collar (6)<br>
and the body slots (4), the said body having a stub (9) that<br>
connects gas tight into the mouth of the Cylinder Valve (7),<br>
the stub having a fixed pin (3) at the lower end and 2 holes<br>
in 'Y' shape (5) for the L P gas to flow freely from the<br>
Cylinder Valve (7) to the Lower Pressure Chamber of the<br>
Pressure Regulator (10).<br>
2	A Fix Pin Pressure Regulator for L P Gas Cylinder Valve<br>
substantially as herein described and illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br></td>
