Background Art<br>
	The mobile network telephone, as a communication means, has currently developed<br>
rapidly worldwide because of its characteristics that it is portable and can be use at any time<br>
and any place, and the government departments of some countries bring this communication<br>
means into their daily office work. When using the mobile telephone, some secret-guarding<br>
departments such as the jail and detention center bring forward the following demands:<br>
when the users of this department are inside the department (specific geographic location),<br>
they can call their colleagues in the same department, but can not communicate with people<br>
outside the department, so as to avoid the leak of sensitive messages to the outside fast;<br>
when the users of this department are not inside the department, then they are permitted to<br>
call and answer calls as a common user does; furthermore, when a user who is not a user of<br>
this department enters into this department, the user is not permitted to call or answer calls.<br>
These demands that the call authority is decided according to the location are still not solved<br>
in the prior art.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
	The technical problem that the present invention aims to solve is to provide a method of<br>

and wireless-side devices, including: planning the coverage area of the base station of a<br>
specific department and deploying base station devices, so that the geographic area of the<br>
specific department is just covered by these base stations; defining a restricted position area<br>
in the service switching point devices of the mobile intelligent network, so that the restricted<br>
position area covers the geographic area of the specific unit which needs to redistribute the<br>
1<br><br>
call authority; furthermore, a user belonging to the specific unit subscribing an intelligent<br>
network service being referred to as a service user, and a user not subscribing the intelligent<br>
network service being referred to as a non-service users;<br>
	step 3: the service switching point devices of the mobile intelligent network providing<br>
management function of a call barring service area, for the non-service user, setting the<br>
restricted position areas as a service use-barred area at the service switching point device of<br>
the mobile intelligent network, so as to restrict the call authority of the non-service user; for<br>
the service user, setting that the call authority can be used inside the restricted position areas<br>
at the service switching point device of the mobile intelligent network; and<br>
	step 4: loading a service logic software which realizes the intelligent network service at<br>
the service control point device of the mobile intelligent network, when a service user makes<br>
a call, the service logic software controlling the call authority of the service user according to<br>
the preset parameters.<br>
	The above method of implementing call authority based on a mobile intelligent network,<br>
characterized in that in step 4, the process of controlling the call authority of a service user or<br>
a non-service user is realized through the following controls:<br>
when a non-service user enters into the restricted position areas, the service control<br>
point device controls that the non-service user cannot call or answer calls, or cannot receive<br>
or send short messages;<br>
	when a service user answers or makes a call or receives or sends short messages in the<br>
restricted position area, the service user is only permitted to make calls with the users of the<br>
same specific department; and<br>
	when the non-service user or the service user is outside the restricted position area, they<br>
are permitted to call freely.<br>
	The above method of implementing call authority based on a mobile intelligent network,<br>
characterized in that in step 2, in the process of configuration of service data for a service<br>
user, the service user number, the home department of the service user and the restricted<br>
position area of the service user are stored in the service system.<br>
	The above method of implementing call authority based on a mobile intelligent network,<br>
characterized in that step 4 further includes the step of: at the beginning of the call, the<br>
service data are transmitted to the service logic software in the service control point from an<br>
initial detection point, and the service logic software provides the match function of the<br>
corresponding relationship between the obtained parameter of the restricted position area<br>
and the stored parameter of the restricted position area.<br>
The above method of implementing call authority based on a mobile intelligent network,<br>

following steps:<br>
	the user dials numbers and makes a call, and triggers at the service switching point the<br>
present service at the service control point through subscription data;<br>
	the mobile intelligent network system obtains calling numbers, called numbers and the<br>
parameter of the restricted position area from service triggering data;<br>
	the system configures the restricted position area according to the parameter of the<br>
restricted position area, and confirms whether the user is in the restricted area; if the present<br>
location of the user is not in the restricted area, then connects the call, the calling user and<br>
2<br><br>
the called user talks with each other, then the call is over; or else, turn to the next step;<br>
	the system judges whether the calling number and the called number are the users of the<br>
same specific department, if they are, then connects the call, the calling user and the called<br>
user talk with each other, then the call is over; or else, turn to the next step; and<br>
	the system plays announcement to the calling user, warning the user that the call cannot<br>
be connected, the system releases the call, and then the call is over.<br>

needs to redistribute the call authority; and for subscribing an intelligent network service for<br>
the users belonging to the specific department, referred to as a service user, and a user who<br>
does not subscribe the intelligent network service is referred to as a non-service user. When<br>
a non-service user enters into the restricted position area, the service switching point device<br>
performs call restriction to the non-service user, so that the non-service user cannot<br>
answer/make calls or receive/send short messages, while a service user enters into the<br>
restricted position area, only the call with the users of the same specific department is<br>

Embodiments for Carrying Out the Present Invention<br>
	The following is a further detailed description of the implementation of the technical<br>
solution in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, and the accompanying drawings<br>
show a system based on a mobile intelligent network—PHS (Personal Handyphone System)<br>
intelligent network, and the following description is made in conjunction with the PHS<br>
network.<br>
	In the present invention, the concept of PA (Position Area) is defined, and a position area<br>
is composed of some base station coverage areas, and a PA designates a geographic area<br>
since the geographic location of the base station is fixed. Furthermore, when a user is using<br>
the PHS telephone, the PHS telephone certainly will make a call or receive a call through a<br>
base station, so the user and the base station are in the same area, if the base station is<br>
designated to belong to a PA, then it can be confirmed that the user is in the PA. The present<br>
invention designs that each PA is planned by the service provider, so as to achieve the<br>
purpose of distinguishing the call authorities. The PA is in logic sense, which can be<br>
illustrated by a numeric string of fixed length, such as 0250528700001234.<br>
	The system of the present invention adopts the manner of intelligent network device, as<br>
illustrated in figure 1, which is mainly composed of the following parts: a service switching<br>
point device 20 (Service Switching point, SSP), a service control point device 10 (Service<br>
Control Point, SCP), and the wireless-side devices of the PHS intelligent network such as a<br>
base station device 40 and a base station control device 30. In the present invention, the<br>
4<br><br>
SSP device has the function of managing PA, and the management of PAs just needs<br>
operations on the SSP, and the SSP can use the CAP protocol in the No. 7 signaling to trigger<br>
the intelligent network service, when triggering the service, it transmits the present PA<br>
parameter of a user 50 (PHS telephone) to the service loaded on the SCP.<br>
	Besides planning PA, the service logic software as described in the present invention will<br>
be loaded on the SCP, and numbers will be distributed, position areas will be configured, and<br>
home departments (groups) will be assigned for the service users (PHS telephone). After<br>
completing the configuration of the service data, when a service user makes a call or other<br>
users call the service user, the service logic will control whether the service user can connect<br>
the call according to the preset parameters.<br>
	The present invention demands that the configuration of the service data be completed in<br>
the SSP and the radio network device firstly. These configurations of data comprise:<br>
		(1) 	planning the base station coverage area of a specific department (group), so that<br>
t			he geographic area of the specific department (group) is just covered by some<br>
			base stations; defining the PA areas in the SSP, and these PAs cover the areas<br>
			which need to redistribute the call authority, i.e., composed of the base stations<br>
			which cover the geographic area, and setting these areas as the "service<br>
			use-barred area" in the SSP, i.e., the restricted position area, then when a<br>
			common user enters into these areas, the common user can not make/answer<br>
			calls or receive/send short messages.<br>
		(2) 	As for the telephone of a user of the specific department (group), setting in the<br>
			SSP that the service (i.e., when these users enter into the area defined in step 1,<br>
			they can make or answer calls) can be used in the "service use-barred area" and<br>
			subscribing an intelligent network service (these users are referred to as service<br>
			user in the present i	nvention) for these users.<br>
	The service logic software as described in the present invention needs to be loaded on the<br>
SCP, and the number of the service user (PHS telephone), the home department (group) of<br>
the service user, and the restricted position area (PA) of the service user need to be stored in<br>
the service system of the SCP.<br>
	The service in the present invention has the characters as follows:<br>
	the service divides several PAs into a restricted position area by using the aforesaid PA.<br>
When a non-service user enters into this area, the non-service user can not answer/make<br>
calls under the control of the SSP; when the present service user makes or answers calls in<br>
this area, only the call with the user of the same department (group) is permitted by the<br>
service.<br>
	The PA data is transmitted to the service through the IDP (Initial Detection Point)<br>
parameter at the beginning of the call, and the service provides the function of setting the<br>
corresponding relationship between the PA and the restricted position area.<br>
	The following is the explanation of the call flow which adopts the method of the present<br>
invention in conjunction with figure 2 to figure 6:<br>
	Figure 6 is a schematic view of call flow according to the present invention, which explains<br>
the method for processing the call of a service user by the present invention:<br>
	step 601, a user dialing numbers and making a call (the service user serves as a calling<br>
user or a called user), triggering the present service in the SCP through subscription data in<br>
5<br><br>
the SSP;<br>
	step 602, the system obtaining the calling number, called number and the PA parameter<br>
from the service triggering data;<br>
	step 603, the system matching the restricted area according to the PA parameter and<br>
determining whether the service user is in the restricted area, if the present location of the<br>
service user is not in the restricted area, then turn to step 606 and all are over; or else, turn<br>
to the next step 604;<br>
	step 604, obtaining the calling number and the called number from the service triggering<br>
data;<br>
	step 605, the system judging whether the calling number and the called number are the<br>
users of the same department, if they are, then turning to the next step and all are over; or<br>
else, turn to step 607;<br>
	step 606, connecting the call, the calling user and the called user talk with each other;<br>
	step 607, playing announcement to the calling user, and warning the user that call cannot<br>
be connected; and<br>
	step 608, the system releasing the call, then the calls is over.<br>
	The above call flow just explains the call processing flow of the service user, for the<br>
non-service user, its call authority is determined by the service switching point, and the call<br>
processing flow is similar to above mentioned, and it will not be described again.<br>
	As illustrated in figure 2, in conjunction with figure 6, the explanation of the service user<br>
as a calling user in the non-restricted position area is as follows:<br>
	1.	a service user dialing numbers and making a call, and triggering the present<br>
		service of the SCP through the subscription data in the SSP.<br>
	2.	the system obtaining the calling number, the called number and PA parameter<br>
f		rom the service triggering data.<br>
	3.	the system matching the restricted area according to the PA parameter,<br>
		determining that the user is not in the restricted area, connecting the call, the<br>
		calling user and the called user talking with each other, and then the call is over.<br>
	As illustrated in figure 3, in conjunction with figure 6, the following is the explanation of<br>
the circumstance that a service user, as the calling user, dials the telephone of a user of the<br>
present department in the restricted position area:<br>
	1.	a service user dialing numbers and making a call, and triggering the present<br>
		service of the SCP through the subscription data in the SSP.<br>
	2.	the system obtaining the calling number, the called number and PA parameter<br>
		from the service triggering data.<br>
	3.	the system checking the service data according to the calling number and the<br>
		called number, determining that the calling user and the called user are the users<br>
		of the same department (group), connecting the call, the calling user and the<br>
		called user talking with each other, and then the call is over.<br>
	As illustrated in figure 4, in conjunction with figure 6, the following is the explanation of<br>
the circumstance that a service user, as the calling user, dials the telephone of a user who<br>
does not belong to the present unit in the restricted position area:<br>
	1.	a service user dialing numbers and making a call, and triggering the present<br>
		service of the SCP through the subscription data in the SSP.<br>
6<br><br>
	2.	the system obtaining the calling number, the called number and PA parameter<br>
		from the service triggering data.<br>
	3.	the system matching the restricted area according to the PA parameter,<br>
		determining that the user is not in the restricted area, checking the service data,<br>
		determining that the calling user and the called user are not users of the same<br>
		department (group), releasing the call, and then the call is over.<br>
	As illustrated in figure 5, the following is the explanation that the non-service user, as the<br>
calling user, makes a call in the restricted position area:<br>
	1.	a non-service user dialing numbers and making a call, and starting the call<br>
		processing flow in the SSP.<br>
	2.	the SSP judging that the user is in the restricted position area and judging that the<br>
		user is not the subscribed service user according to the user data stored in the<br>
		present system.<br>
	3.	the SSP releasing the call, and the call is over.<br>
	From the above embodiments, it can be seen that the call authorities of different users is<br>
distinguished from each other through the method of setting the restricted area according to<br>
the present invention, no matter for a non-service user or a service user, and no matter being<br>
a calling user or a called user, the effect of decentralized authority restricting call can be<br>
achieved, as a result, the effect that different users have different call authorities in different<br>
areas can be achieved.<br>
	In the GSM network and the CDMA network, there is also a network protocol similar to the<br>
above PHS, transmission of information such as the calling number, the called number and<br>
the position parameter is provided in the protocol, so the method proposed by the present<br>
invention fits these networks, too.<br>
	Of course, the present invention can have many other embodiments, various<br>
corresponding amendments and alterations can be made by those skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit and essential of the present invention, but these corresponding<br>
amendments and alterations should fall within the protected scope claimed by the claims of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Industrial applicability<br>
	Compared with the prior art, the present invention can flexibly set specific areas for a<br>
user, and the effect of restricting any call of a user or the effect of only being able to make<br>
calls in a certain area by the user can be achieved by the method of call authority, and the<br>
service provider can provide the present invention to departments such as jails and detention<br>
centers, so that their demand of keeping secret in using the PHS telephone can be met.<br>
7<br><br>

The present invention relates to a method of implementing call authority based on mobile<br>
intelligent network and the system thereof, and it performs distribution of numbers for<br>
service users and configuration of service data on service switching point devices and<br>
wireless-side devices of a mobile intelligent network system, which includes distribution of<br>
numbers for the service users, configuration of restricted position areas, and assignment of<br>
home units, etc.; and it loads a service logic software which realizes the intelligent network<br>
service at a service control point device of the intelligent network, when a service user or a<br>
non-service user makes a call service, the service logic software and the service switching<br>
point control the call authority of the service user or non-service user according to the preset<br>
parameters, therefore different users can have different call authorities when they are in<br>
different areas. The demands such as call security of the user in specific location can be<br>
achieved by the method of the present invention.</td>
