				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a tablet composition useful for extended release of isosorbide mononitrate.<br>
The invention pertains a pharmaceutical composition useful for extended release of isosorbide mononitrate to an environment of use. More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical composition for extended release of isosorbide mononitrate, which operates on the principles of diffusion, osmotic pressure, or a combination of both. The pharmaceutical composition, in the present invention, comprises of tablet core of isosorbide mononitrate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, osmagents, and other conventional excipients. The tablet core is coated with a rate controlling membrane wall, which is made up of a semipermeable and permeable membrane forming polymers.<br>
Isosorbide 5 mononitrate (ISMN) is an active metabolite of isosorbide dimtrate and acts by relaxing the smooth muscles of the cardiovascular system. It is indicated for the treatment of the angina pectoris arising from coronary insufficiency. As other nitro derivatives, ISMN causes, in the greater portion of treated subjects, undesired effects such as headache, cutaneous blood-vessel dilation, and somnolence. ISMN has been formulated in a number of different ways so as to allow either immediate release or extended release of the drug. The use of extended release formulation will provide a more uniform plasma concentration of ISMN for a definite period of time and will tend to avoid the peak and trough effects associated with immediate release formulations. The frequency of daily administration will be reduced and a uniform plasma concentration for a definite period of time will avoid any development of tolerance, resulting in enhanced patient compliance. All the above side effects of ISMN and the fact that the half-life of<br>
the drug is around 4 to 5 hours, the advantages of a pharmaceutical composition for extended release of ISMN, appear evident.<br>
However, ISMN has certain drawbacks, which make it difficult to formulate it in a extended-release dosage form, namely: a static electricity phenomenon, which makes any dry mixing almost impossible when it is processed alone in a dry form, a sublimation phenomenon, i.e., transition from a solid to gas under certain conditions encountered during processing, and a very high aqueous solubility.<br>
There are number of controlled release dosage forms available commercially that can be used for oral delivery of drugs. In matrix systems, the drug is embedded in a polymer matrix and the release takes place by partitioning of the drug into the poiymer matrix and the release medium. However, factors like pH, presence of food, and other physiological factors may affect drug release from matrix systems. Osmotic systems utilize the principles of osmotic pressure for the delivery of drugs. These systems typically consist of a tablet core of drug with or without an osmagents, coated with a rate controlling membrane. Delivery of drug takes place through an orifice that is created in the membrane using a mechanical or a laser drill.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for extended delivery of ISMN, to the environment of use. are well known in the prior art. Reference may be made to U.S. Patent No. 5,851,555, which discloses a pharmaceutical composition containing ISMN along with an optional inert carrier, a cellulosic polymer, and a lipophilic ingredient. ISMN is mixed with the inert carrier, cellulosic polymer, lipophilic ingredient, and other excipients The mixture is then heated at 70°C to 90°C for about 3 hours with stirring at 1 -hour intervals. This blend is then chopped in a high shear mixer, which is then cooled and milled to get a<br>
solid dispersion in a granulate form. The mixture so obtained is then blended with additional amounts of cellulosic polymers, fillers, and lubricants and compressed into a dosage unit. U.S. Patent No. 5,453,283 discloses delayed release oral dosage forms wherein the drug is melt-blended with a thermoplastic material (preferably polyvinyl acetate) and a "structure former" (e.g., lactose). Drug along with an inert carrier and polyvinyl acetate is sifted and heated to about 80°C. The melt is then kneaded with a pestle and after further processing, which involves hardening of the material and cutting into small pieces, the material is then mixed with other excipients and compressed m the form of tablets. Reference may also be made to Pharmazie, Vol. 47, pp 465-466 and vol. Vol. 48, pp 611-613, wherein microballs of ISMN are prepared by dropping 86% aqueous mixture of ISMN-sorbitol-mannitol into liquid paraffin at the temperature of 423 K. The cores are then fractionated by means of sieves and microballs having diameter of 0.8 to 2.0 mm are coated with a membrane wall. Though the above compositions are useful for extended delivery of ISMN, their use can be limited because of number of manufacturing steps involved and difficulty in scaling up the technology to commercial scale.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,869,094 discloses a pharmaceutical composition in which inert sugar beads are first coated with a depot layer (containing ISMN along with PVP, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, talc, and polyethylene glycol). Immediately after the application of depot layer, remaining coating suspension (without drug) is applied to the beads. The beads are further coated with a retarding coat containing ethyl cellulose and polymethacrylate. This composition can be useful for extended delivery of ISMN but the number of coating steps involved in the manufacturing can limit its commercial use.<br>
Moreover, the drug is present in the coating composition only and applied by spraying, therefore, slight variation in the amount of coating applied can affect the drug content of the formulation, which could result in variable drug input to the body.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,812,316 discloses a pharmaceutical composition in which ISMN is mixed with polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to form a solid solution. This solution is then mixed with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and other additives. The ratio of polymers (PVP plus HPMC) to drug is 1:5 to 5:1. PCT Patent Application W.O. 98/05306 discloses a pharmaceutical composition in which ISMN is granulated with a solution of PVP and the dry granules are blended with a cellulose-based polymer U.S. Patent No. 5,334,393 discloses a pharmaceutical composition for controlled release of 5-ISMN, which is made by combining drug particles having four or more different sizes with a swellable hydrophilic polymer. The swellable polymers may be selected from natural gums, alginic derivatives, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and/or ethylhydroxypropyl cellulose. All the compositions that have been described above are based on matrix technology.<br>
In the light of the above discussion, it will be readily appreciated by those versed in the subject art that a critical need exists for a novel pharmaceutical composition useful for extended release of ISMN, which is simple in design, involves less number of manufacturing steps, and is easily amenable to mass production.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition useful for extended release of ISMN, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition that contains ISMN along with an inert carrier, PVP, and osmotically effective solutes or osmagents that are soluble in water and capable of exhibiting an osmotic pressure gradient across the wall against the external fluids.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition, which comprises of a rate controlling membrane consisting of semipermeable and permeable membrane forming polymers that surrounds the tablet core compartment consisting of ISMN along with an inert carrier, PVP, and osmagents.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising of a rate controlling membrane that surrounds the core compartment, which rate controlling membrane comprises of a semipermeable membrane forming polymer, which is permeable to the aqueous fluids but is substantially impermeable to the components of the core, and a permeable membrane forming polymer, which is permeable to aqueous fluids and at least one of the components of the core.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising of a rate controlling membrane surrounding the core compartment, where the rate controlling membrane comprises of a semipermeable membrane forming polymer, permeable membrane forming polymer, and at leasi one plasticizer capable of modulating the film formation properties of the polymers.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition, from where the drug release occurs- through the mechanisms of diffusion.<br>
osmotic pumping, or a combination of both and is simple in design and amenable to mass<br>
oroduction.<br>

The pharmaceutical composition, in the present invention, is manufactured by standard techniques of tableting and coating. For example, in one of the procedures the drug, inert carrier, PVP, and osmagents are dry blended. These components are then mixed with conventional excipients so as to form core tablet. Optionally, the core composition can be prepared by the techniques of slugging or wet granulation, hi wet granulation, the drug is blended with the other excipients using water or an organic cosolvent such as isopropyl alcohol/methylene chloride, 80/20, V/V as the granulation fluid. The wet granules are dried and passed through a 22-mesh screen and blended with lubricant and glidant in a mixer. The blend is then compressed in the form of a tablet. The compressed tablet is then coated with a membrane wall. The wall forming composition<br>
can be applied using the techniques of press coating, spraying, dipping, or air suspension techniques. The wall surrounding the tablet core is prepared by using the mixture of semipermeable and permeable membrane forming polymers and it is possible to control the permeability of the membrane by varying the ratio of semipermeable and permeable polymers. In operation, the core compartment imbibes aqueous fluids from the surrounding environment across the rate controlling membrane. The dissolved drug is released at a controlled rate across the membrane wall. The novelty in the present invention is that a novel pharmaceutical composition, consisting of a tablet core of 1SMN, an inert carrier, PVP, and osmagent, is prepared and coated with a membrane wall forming composition consisting of a semipermeable membrane forming polymer, permeable membrane forming polymer, and plasticizer(s). Thus, the pharmaceutical composition, in the present invention, is simple, easy to manufacture, and easily amenable to mass production as compared to prior art and yet effective in extended release of ISMN.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Core tablets of ISMN were prepared as per the following formula<br>
(Formula &amp; Table Removed)<br>
ISMN and spray dried lactose (Flow lac-100, Meggie, Germany) were mixed for 10 minutes. After passing this mixture through a 30-mesh sieve (BSS), PVP and sodium chloride (30-mesh passed) were added and the mixing continued for 10 additional minutes. To the mix. (&gt;0-mesh passed magnesium stearate and aerosii were added and mixing continued for lo more minutes. The blend was compressed in the form of biconvex tablets having an average weight of 300 mg using a single stroke tablet punching machine (Cadmach GMS-15, India) having 9.00 mm round standard concave punches. 80 of these tablets were placed in a laboratory scale 10" perforated coater (Ganscoater-GAC 250. Gansons. India) along with 400 grams of filler tablets (tablets made using 7.00 mm round deep concave punches and containing microcrystalline cellulose, starch, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, and aerosii) and coated with a coating solution comprising of<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The coating solution was prepared by adding ethyl cellulose (Ethocel standard 10 cp premium, Colorcon Asia Pvt. Lt., Mumbai) to the mixture of methylene chloride and ethanol. After the entire polymer was dissolved, PVP was added with continuous stirring. Finally, propylene glycol was added and thoroughly mixed to give the final coating solution. The filler and active tablets were placed in the coating pan and the heated air was passed through the tablet bed. The pan was rotated at 18-20 rpm. When the outlet air temperature reached 28° C, the coating solution was applied through the atomizing nozzle at the rate of 7-8 ml/minute with atomization at 1 Kg/Cm2. Sufficient coating solution was applied until a % weight increase of 4.21 % was achieved on the active tablets. 20 of the active tablets were withdrawn and coating continued until % weight increase of 5.19 % on active tablets was achieved. 20 of the tablets were removed and coating continued to achieve a weight gain of 7.61 % on the active tablets. 20 of the tablets were removed and coating continued to achieve a weight gain of 11.49 % The active tablets were dried in an oven for 16 hours at 50° C. The release studies of these tablets and marketed extended release formulations of ISMN (Imdur 60 mg, Astra Idl, India) was conducted in 900 ml of simulated intestinal fluid, pH 6.8, without enzymes using USP type 1 (basket) apparatus at 100 rpm. The samples were withdrawn periodically and analyzed by HPLC using C-18 column (Spherisorb, Waters, USA) at 220 nm using watenmethanol (80:20) as the mobile phase. The plot of percent drug released versus time is shown in figure 1.<br><br>
The results shown in figure 1 depicts that the pharmaceutical compositions prepared in accordance with the present invention exhibits extended release of ISMN for prolonged period of time. In this example ethyl cellulose is a semipermeable membrane-forming polymer and PVP is a permeable membrane-forming polymer. It is evident from the figure that the drug release is affected by the percentage weight gain of polymer solution on the active tablets and it is possible to modulate the release as per the requirements by varying this membrane parameter.<br>
Example 2<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the following membrane composition was used to explore the possibility of using PEG-4000 as a permeable membrane-forming polymer<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The tablets were coated as described in example 1 and the coating continued until a weight gain of 9.72 % was achieved on the active tablets. The active tablets were dried in an oven for 16 hours at 50° C. The release profile of ISMN from the active tablets in comparison with Imdur tablets is shown in figure 2. It is evident that from the figure that<br>
despite the slow release as compared to those containing PVP as a permeable membrane-forming polymer, the release of ISMN is controlled from the active tablets.<br>
Example 3<br>
Example 1 was repeated except that the following membrane composition was used to explore the possibility of using HPMC as a permeable membrane-forming polymer<br>
The tablets were coated as described in example 1 and the coating continued until a weight gain of 9.49 % was achieved on the active tablets. The active tablets were dried in an oven for 16 hours at 50° C. The release profile of ISMN from the active tablets in comparison with Imdur tablets is shown in figure 3. It is evident that from the figure that despite the slow release as compared to those containing PVP or PEG-4000 as a peraieable membrane-forming polymer, the release of ISMN is controlled from the active tablets.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 4<br>
This study was performed to study the effect of level of permeable membrane forming polymer on the release of ISMN from the formulations. The tablets containing ISMN were coated with the coating compositions given in table 1<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The tablets were coated as described in example 1 and the coating continued until an approximate weight gain of 10.00 % was achieved on the active tablets. The tablets were dried in an oven for 16 hours at 50° C. The release profile of ISMN from the active tablets in comparison with Imdur tablets is shown in figure 4. It is clearly evident from the figure that the release of ISMN increases as the level of permeable membrane forming polymer increases and thus, it is possible to control the release of ISMN by varying the level of permeable membrane forming polymer.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are<br>
1.	The pharmaceutical composition can be used for extended delivery of isosorbide mononitrate.<br>
2.	The release of ISMN from the pharmaceutical composition can be easily adjusted by modulating the membrane variables such as, type and level of permeable-membrane forming polymer and total weight of the membrane wall applied.<br>
3.   The pharmaceutical  composition  is  simple to  manufacture,   involves   less number of manufacturing steps, and is easily amenable to mass production.<br><br><br><br><br>
