				<td>MOBILE TERMINAL AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING ILLUMINATION<br>
OF BACKLIGHT THEREOF<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to subject matter contained in priority Korean<br>
Application No. 10-2007-0106864, filed on October 23, 2007, which is herein<br>
expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Field of Invention<br>
[0002] An apparatus, method and computer program product for actively<br>
controlling the illumination of a mobile terminal backlight according to the<br>
surrounding environment and a mobile terminal that implements such an<br>
apparatus and method are provided.<br>
Discussion of the Background<br>
[0003] A mobile terminal is a device that can be carried around and have one or<br>
more functions such as voice and video call communication, inputting and<br>
outputting information, storing data, and the like.<br>
[0004] As such the functions become more diversified, the mobile terminal can<br>
support more complicated functions such as capturing images or video,<br>
reproducing music or video files, playing games, receiving broadcast signals, and<br>
the like. By comprehensively and collectively implementing such functions, the<br>
mobile terminal may be embodied in the form of a multimedia player or device.<br>
 [0005] In order to implement various functions, numerous attempts are being<br>
made and implemented in terms of hardware or software in such multimedia<br><br>
player or devices. For example, a user interface environment is provided to allow<br>
users to easily and conveniently search or select one or more functions.<br>
[0006] Also, as users consider their mobile terminal to be a personal portable<br>
device that may express their personality, various designs for the mobile terminals<br>
are required. For example, folder type, slide type, bar type and rotation type<br>
designs are employed for mobile terminals.<br>
[0007] However, the related art mobile terminal simply controls the brightness of a<br>
backlight used in a display unit, without actively controlling the brightness<br>
according to ambient illumination (i.e., the brightness of the surrounding<br>
environment).<br>
[0008] Namely, the brightness of backlight illumination is controlled by about two<br>
steps according to an operation state of the mobile terminal, not according to the<br>
surrounding environment. For example, when the folder part of the related art<br>
mobile terminal is opened, the backlight is unconditionally controlled to operated at<br>
its maximum brightness regardless of ambient illumination, and when the mobile<br>
terminal returns to the standby state after the lapse of time, the backlight is<br>
unconditionally controlled to operate at its minimum brightness.<br>
[0009] Thus, in the related art mobile terminal, because the illumination of the<br>
backlight is controlled without considering the ambient illumination conditions,<br>
when the backlight is unconditionally controlled to operate at its maximum<br>
brightness, power consumption increases, and when the backlight is<br>
unconditionally controlled to operate at its minimum brightness, visibility of the<br>
display unit is degraded.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The present inventors recognized certain drawbacks of the related art, as<br>
explained above. Upon such recognition, the following concepts and features have<br>
been conceived.<br>
[0011] A mobile terminal, method and computer program product for actively<br>
controlling the illumination of its backlight according to an ambient illuminance and<br>
an apparatus, method and computer program product for controlling the<br>
illumination of the backlight of the mobile terminal are provided herein.<br>
[0012] A mobile terminal , method and computer program product for actively<br>
controlling the illumination of its backlight according to an ambient illuminance to<br>
reduce power consumption and improve visibility of its display unit, and an<br>
apparatus, method and computer program product for controlling illumination of a<br>
backlight of the mobile terminal are also provided herein.<br>
[0013] Thus, a mobile terminal related to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
includes: an illuminance sensor that detects an ambient illuminance; a backlight<br>
controller that controls brightness of illumination by regulating the power outputted<br>
to a backlight according to a change in the ambient illuminance detected by the<br>
illuminance sensor; and a controller that monitors an operation state of the<br>
backlight controller or changes a set value of a particular register by cooperating<br>
with the backlight controller.<br>
[0014] Also, an apparatus for controlling illumination of a backlight related to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention includes: a current regulating unit<br>
that controls current of driving power to be outputted to a backlight according to a<br>
change in an ambient illuminance; a limiter that controls such that the voltage of<br>
the power outputted from the current regulating, unit does not exceed a pre-set<br>
level; and a delay unit that allows the brightness of the backlight illumination to<br>
3<br><br>
change in a gradual manner during a particular delay time when an ambient<br>
illuminance changes rapidly.<br>
[0015] In one embodiment of the present invention, because brightness of<br>
illumination of a backlight of the mobile terminal is actively controlled according to<br>
illumination of the surrounding environment, current consumption of the mobile<br>
terminal can be reduced and visibility of a display unit can be improved.<br>
[0016] In one embodiment of the present invention, a minimum illuminance value,<br>
a maximum illuminance value, and the change speed of brightness to be used for<br>
brightness of illumination of the backlight of the mobile terminal can be set by<br>
software.<br>
[0017] In the present invention, an illuminance value and a brightness changing<br>
rate to be used for controlling brightness of illumination of the backlight of the<br>
mobile terminal can be changed even after the mobile terminal is manufactured.<br>

reference numerals are given to the elements that perform the same functions.<br>
[0029] The mobile terminal described in the present invention may include a<br>
mobile phone, a smart phone a notebook computer, a navigation, a digital<br>
broadcasting terminal, a PDA (Personal Digital Assistant), a PMP (Portable<br>
5<br><br>
Multimedia Player), and the like.<br>
[0030] FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing the configuration of a mobile<br>
terminal related to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0031] The mobile terminal 100 may comprise elements, such as a wireless<br>
communication unit 110, an audio/video (A/V) input unit 120, a user input unit 130,<br>
a sensing unit 140, an output unit 150, a memory 160, an interface unit 170, a<br>
controller 180, and a power supply unit 190, and the like. FIG. 1 illustrates the<br>
mobile terminal having various elements. However, it is understood that the<br>
illustrated elements are not all essential elements. That is, the mobile terminal may<br>
be implemented with a larger number of elements or a smaller number of<br>
elements, as required.<br>
[0032] The wireless communication unit 110 may include at least one element<br>
which permits wireless communication between the mobile terminal 100 and a<br>
wireless communication system or between the mobile terminal 100 and a network<br>
in which the mobile terminal 100 is located. For example, the wireless<br>
communication unit 110 may comprise a broadcast receiving module 111, a mobile<br>
communication module 112, a wireless internet module 113, a short-range<br>
communication module 114 and a location information module 115.<br>
[0033] The broadcast receiving module 111 receives a broadcast signal and/or<br>
broadcast associated information from an external broadcast management server<br>
via a broadcast channel. The broadcast channel may include a satellite channel<br>
and a terrestrial channel. The broadcast management server may refer to a server<br>
that generates and transmits a broadcast signal and/or broadcast associated<br>
information or a server that receives a pre-generated broadcast signal and/or<br>
broadcast associated information and sends them to the mobile terminal. The<br>
6<br><br>
broadcast associated information may include information associated with a<br>
broadcast channel, a broadcast program, or a broadcast service provider, etc. The<br>
broadcast signal may include not only a TV broadcast signal, a radio broadcast<br>
signal, and a data broadcast signal, but also a broadcast signal obtained by<br>
combining the data broadcast signal to the TV broadcast signal or the radio<br>
broadcast signal.<br>
[0034] The broadcast associated information may be provided via a mobile<br>
communication network, and in this case, it may be received by the mobile<br>
communication module 112.<br>
[0035] The broadcast associated information may exist in various formats. For<br>
instance, the broadcast associated information may exist in such formats as<br>
Electronic Program Guide (EPG) of Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB),<br>
Electronic Service Guide (ESG) of Digital Video Broadcast-Handheld (DVB-H),<br>
and the like.<br>
[0036] The broadcast receiving module 111 receives broadcast signals by using<br>
various types of broadcast systems. In particular, the broadcast receiving module<br>
111 may receive digital broadcast signals by using digital broadcast systems such<br>
as Digital Multimedia Broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T), Digital Multimedia<br>
Broadcasting-satellite (DMB-S), Media Forward Link Only (MediaFLO™), Digital<br>
Video Broadcast-handheld (DVB-H), Integrated Services Digital Broadcast-<br>
Terrestrial (ISDB-T), and the like. The broadcast receiving module 111 may be<br>
configured to be suitable for certain broadcast systems that provide broadcast<br>
signals, as well as for the digital broadcasting systems.<br>
[0037] Broadcast signals and/or broadcast associated information received via the<br>
broadcast receiving module 111 may be stored in the memory 160.<br>
7<br><br>
[0038] The mobile communication module 112 transmits/receives radio signals<br>
to/from at least one of a base station, an external mobile terminal, a server in a<br>
mobile communication network, and the like. Here, the radio signals may include a<br>
voice call signal, a video call signal, or various formats of data according to<br>
transmission/reception of text/multimedia messages.<br>
[0039] The wireless Internet (network) module 113 supports wireless network<br>
access. This module may be internally or externally coupled to the mobile terminal.<br>
[0040] The short-range communication module 114 refers to a module for<br>
supporting short range communications. Some examples of short-range<br>
communication technology includes Bluetooth™, Radio Frequency IDentification<br>
(RFID), Infrared Data Association (IrDA), Ultra-WideBand (UWB), ZigBee™, and<br>
the like.<br>
[0041] The location information module 115 may check or obtain a location<br>
information of the mobile terminal. For example, the location information module<br>
115 may include a Global Positioning System (GPS) module. The GPS module<br>
may receive location information from several artificial satellites. Here, the location<br>
information may include coordinates information indicated as the latitude and the<br>
longitude. For example, the GPS module may measure each precise time and<br>
distance from three or more satellites and accurately calculate a current location<br>
according to trigonometry based on the three different distances. A method in<br>
which the distance and time information are obtained from three satellites and an<br>
error is corrected by a single satellite may be also used. In particular, the GPS<br>
module may obtain a precise time together with three-dimensional speed<br>
information as well as the latitude, the ongitude and the altitude from the location<br>
information received from the satellite.<br>
8<br><br>
[0042] The A/V input unit 120 is configured to input an audio or video signal. The<br>
A/V input unit 120 may include a camera 121 and a microphone 122. The camera<br>
121 processes image data of still pictures or videos obtained by an image capture<br>
device in a video capturing mode or an image capturing mode. The processed<br>
image frames may be displayed on a display unit 151.<br>
[0043] The image frames processed by the camera 121 may be stored in the<br>
memory 160 or transmitted via the wireless communication unit 110. Two or more<br>
cameras 121 may be provided according to the configuration of the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
[0044] The microphone 122 may receive sounds (audible data) via a microphone<br>
(or the like) in a phone call mode, a recording mode, a voice recognition mode,<br>
and the like, and process it into audio data. The processed audio (voice) data may<br>
be converted for output into a format transmittable to a mobile communication<br>
base station via the mobile communication module 112 in case of the phone call<br>
mode. The microphone 122 may include various types of noise canceling (or<br>
suppression) algorithms to cancel (or suppress) noise generated in the course of<br>
receiving and transmitting audio signals.<br>
[0045] The user input unit 130 may generate key input data inputted by a user to<br>
control various operations of the mobile terminal. The user input unit 130 may<br>
include a keypad, a dome switch, a touch pad (e.g., a touch sensitive member that<br>
detects changes in resistance, pressure, capacitance, etc.), a jog wheel, a jog<br>
switch, and the like. In particular, when the touch pad is overlaid on the display<br>
unit 151 in a layered manner, it may be called a touch screen.<br>
[0046] The sensing unit 140 detects a current status (or state) of the mobile<br>
terminal 100 such as an open/close state of the mobile terminal 100, a location of<br>
9<br><br>
the mobile terminal 100, presence or absence of user contact with the mobile<br>
terminal, the orientation of the mobile terminal, acceleration/deceleration of the<br>
mobile terminal 100, etc., and generates commands or signals for controlling the<br>
operation of the mobile terminal 100. For example, when the mobile terminal 100<br>
is a slide type mobile phone, the sensing unit 140 may sense whether the slide<br>
phone is opened or closed. In addition, the sensing unit 140 can detect whether or<br>
not the power supply unit 190 supplies power or whether or not the interface unit<br>
170 is coupled with an external device.<br>
[0047] The interface unit 170 serves as an interface with at least one external<br>
device connected with the mobile terminal 100. For example, the external devices<br>
may include wired/wireless headsets, external power charger ports, wired/wireless<br>
data ports, memory card ports, a port for connecting a device having an<br>
identification module, audio input/output (I/O) ports, video I/O ports, earphone<br>
ports, and the like.<br>
[0048] Here, the identification module may refer to a chip storing various<br>
information to authenticate the authority to use the mobile terminal 100 and<br>
include a user identity module (UIM), a subscriber identity module (SIM), a<br>
universal subscriber identity module (USIM), etc. The device having the<br>
identification module (referred to as 'identifying device', hereinafter) may be<br>
fabricated as a smart card. Thus, the identifying device may be connected with the<br>
mobile terminal 100. The interface unit 170 may be used to receive inputs (e.g.,<br>
data, information, power, etc.) from an external device and transfer the received<br>
inputs to one or more elements within the mobile terminal, or may be used to<br>
transfer data from the mobile terminal to an external device.<br>
[0049] The output unit 150 is configured to provide outputs in a visual, audible,<br>
10<br><br>
and/or tactile manner (e.g., audio signal, video signal, alarm signal, etc.). The<br>
output unit 150 may include the display unit 151, an audio output module 152, an<br>
alarm unit 153, and the like.<br>
[0050] The display unit 151 may output information processed in the mobile<br>
terminal 100. For example, when the mobile terminal 100 is in the phone call<br>
mode, the display unit 151 may display a User Interface (Ul) or a Graphic User<br>
Interface (GUI) associated with a call or other communication. When the mobile<br>
terminal 100 is in the video call mode or the image capturing mode, the display<br>
unit 151 may display a captured and/or received image, a Ul, a GUI, and the like.<br>
[0051] Meanwhile, when the display unit 151 and the touch pad are overlaid in a<br>
layered manner to form a touch screen, the display unit 151 may function as both<br>
an input device and an output device. The display unit 151 may include at least<br>
one of a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), a Thin Film Transistor-LCD (TFT-LCD), an<br>
Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED), a flexible display, a three-dimensional (3D)<br>
display, or the like. The mobile terminal 100 may include two or more display units<br>
(or other display means) according to its embodiment. For example, the mobile<br>
terminal may include an external display screen and an internal display screen.<br>
[0052] The audio output module 152 may output audio data received from the<br>
wireless communication unit 110 or stored in the memory 160 in a call signal<br>
reception mode, a call mode, a record mode, a voice recognition mode, a<br>
broadcast reception mode, and the like. Also, the audio output module 152 may<br>
provide audible outputs related to a particular function (e.g., a call signal reception<br>
sound, a message reception sound, etc.) performed by the mobile terminal 100.<br>
The audio output module 152 may includes a speaker, a buzzer, a sound<br>
generating device, or the like.<br>
11<br><br>
[0053] The alarm unit 153 may provide outputs to inform about an occurrence of<br>
an event of the mobile terminal 100. Typical events occurring at the mobile<br>
terminal may include a call signal reception, a message reception, a key signal<br>
input, etc. In addition to audio or video outputs, the alarm unit 153 may provide<br>
outputs in a different manner to inform about an occurrence of an event. For<br>
example, the alarm unit 153 may provide outputs in the form of vibrations (or other<br>
tactile means). When a call signal, a message, or some other incoming<br>
communication is received, the alarm unit 153 may provide tactile outputs (i.e.,<br>
vibrations) to inform the user. Or when a key is pressed (or when a key signal is<br>
generated), the alarm unit 153 may output vibrations to provide tactile feedback<br>
with respect to the pressed key. By providing tactile outputs, the user can<br>
recognize the occurrence of various events. Outputs informing about the<br>
occurrence of an event may be also provided via the display unit151 or the audio<br>
output module 152. In other words, different types of outputs (audible, visual ,<br>
tactile, etc.) may be set such that different types of events can be more easily<br>
recognized by the type of output being provided. For example, an incoming call<br>
may be indicated in an audible manner, an incoming text (or multimedia) message<br>
may be indicated in a visual manner, and keypad user inputs may be indicated in a<br>
tactile manner.<br>
[0054] The memory 160 may store software programs or the like used for the<br>
processing and controlling performed by the controller 180, or may temporarily<br>
store inputted/outputted data (e.g., a phonebook, messages, still images, video,<br>
etc.).<br>
[0055] ThE memory 160 may include at least one type of storage medium<br>
including a flash memory type, a hard disk type, a multimedia card type, a card-<br>
12<br><br>
type memory (e.g., SD or DX memory, etc), a Random Access Memory (RAM), an<br>
SRAM (Static RAM), a Read-Only Memory (ROM), an EEPROM (Electrically<br>
Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), a PROM (Programmable Read-<br>
only Memory), a magnetic memory, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, and the like.<br>
Also, the mobile terminal 100 may cooperate with a network storage device that<br>
performs the storage function of the memory 160 over a network connection.<br>
[0056] The controller 180 typically controls the general operations of the mobile<br>
terminal. For example, the controller 180 performs controlling and processing<br>
associated with voice calls, data communications, video calls, and the like. In<br>
addition, the controller 180 may include a multimedia module 181 for reproducing<br>
(or playing back) multimedia data. The multimedia module 181 may be configured<br>
within the controller 180 or may be configured to be separated from the controller<br>
180.<br>
[0057] The power supply unit 190 receives external or internal power and supplies<br>
power required for the operations of the respective elements under the control of<br>
the controller 180.<br>

[0061] So far, the internal elements of the mobile terminal have been described<br>
from the perspective of their functions. Hereinafter, external elements of the<br>
mobile terminal will be described from the perspective of their functions with<br>
reference to Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
[0062] The mobile terminal may be implemented in a variety of different<br>
configurations, including a folder-type, a bar-type, a swing-type, a slide-type, or<br>
the like. For the sake of brevity, the slide-type mobile terminal will be used as an<br>
example in the following description. However, the concepts and features<br>
described herein should not be limited to the slide-type mobile terminal, but can be<br>
applicable to any type of mobile terminal or other electronic device including the<br>
ones as mentioned above.<br>
[0063] FIG. 2 is a front view of the mobile terminal according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0064] The mobile terminal may comprise a first body 200, and a second body 205<br>
configured to be slidably moved in at least one direction with respect to the first<br>
body 200.<br>
14<br><br>
[0065] A state in which the first body 200 is disposed to overlap with the second<br>
body 205 may be called a closed configuration, and as shown in FIG. 2, a state in<br>
which the first body 200 exposes at least a portion of the second body 205 may be<br>
called an open configuration.<br>
[0066] The mobile terminal may usually operate in a standby mode in the closed<br>
configuration, but this mode can be released by a user manipulation. In the open<br>
configuration, the mobile terminal may mainly function in a call mode or the like,<br>
but may be changed to the standby mode according to user manipulation or after<br>
the lapse of a certain time.<br>
[0067] At least one case (housing, casing, cover, etc.) constituting the external<br>
appearance of the first body 200 comprises a first front case 220 and a first rear<br>
case 225. Various electronic components may be installed inside the first front<br>
case 220 and the first rear case 225. One or more intermediate cases may be<br>
additionally disposed between the first front case 220 and the first rear case 225.<br>
[0068] The case can be formed by injection-molding a synthetic resin, or made of<br>
a metallic material such as stainless steel (STS) or titanium (Ti), or some other<br>
appropriate materials.<br>
[0069] The display unit 151, the audio output module 152, the camera module 121<br>
or a first user input unit 210 may be located on the first body 200, specifically, on<br>
the first front case 220.<br>
[0070] The display unit 151 may include LCD, OLED, and the like, that visually<br>
displays information.<br>
[0071] A touch pad may be overlaid in a layered manner on the display unit 151 to<br>
allow the display unit. 151 to function as a touch screen to input information.<br>
[0072] The audio output module 152 may be implemented as a speaker.<br>
15<br><br>
[0073] The camera 121 may be implemented to be suitable for a user to capture<br>
still images or video of a user and so on.<br>
[0074] Like the first body 200, a case constituting the external appearance of the<br>
second body 205 may be formed by a second front case 230 and a second rear<br>
case 235.<br>
[0075] A second user input unit 215 may be disposed at the second body 205,<br>
specifically, on a front face of the second front case 230.<br>
[0076] A third user input unit 245, a microphone 122 and an interface unit 170 may<br>
be disposed at either the second front case 230 or the second rear case 235.<br>
[0077] The first to third user input units 210, 215 and 245 may be called a<br>
manipulating portion 130, and various methods can be employed for the<br>
manipulation portion so long as it can be operated by the user in a tactile manner.<br>
[0078] For example, the user input unit can be implemented as a dome switch or<br>
touch pad that can receive user commands or information according to a pressing,<br>
pushing or touching, or implemented in the form of a dial, a wheel, a jog element,<br>
a joystick, or the like to allow user manipulation thereof.<br>
[0079] In terms of its functions, the first user input unit 210 is used for inputting<br>
commands such as start, end, scroll or the like, and the second user input unit 215<br>
is used for inputting numbers, characters, symbols, or the like.<br>
[0080] The third user input unit 245 can be operated to support a so-called hot key<br>
function (e.g., speed dialing, dedicated key inputs, etc.) for activating a special<br>
function of the mobile terminal.<br>
[0081] The microphone 122 may be implemented to be suitable for receiving the<br>
user's voice and other various sounds.<br>
[0082] The interface unit 170 may be used as a link (passage or path) through<br>
16<br><br>
which the terminal can exchange data or the like with an external device. For<br>
example, the interface unit 170 may be implemented as one of a connection port<br>
for connecting an earphone to the mobile terminal via a fixed or wireless means, a<br>
port for short-range communications (e.g., an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port,<br>
a Bluetooth™ port, a wireless LAN port, etc.), power supply ports for providing<br>
power to the external device, or the like.<br>
[0083] The interface unit 170 may be a card socket for accommodating an external<br>
card, such as a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), a User Identity Module (UIM), a<br>
memory card for storing information, or the like.<br>
[0084] The power supply unit 190 for supplying power to the terminal is located at<br>
the side portion of the second rear case 235.<br>
[0085] The power supply unit 190 may be, for example, a rechargeable battery<br>
that can be detached.<br>
[0086] FIG. 3 is a rear view of the mobile terminal according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0087] With reference to FIG 3, the camera 121 may be additionally disposed on a<br>
rear surface of the second rear case 235 of the second body 205. The second<br>
camera 121 may have an image capture direction which is substantially the<br>
opposite to that of the camera 121 of the first body 200, and may support a<br>
different number of pixels as that of the first camera 121.<br>
[0088] For example, the camera 121 of the first body 200 may be used for low<br>
resolution (i.e., supporting a relatively small number of pixels) to quickly capture<br>
an image (or video) of the user's face and immediately transmit the same to the<br>
other party during video conferencing or the like. Meanwhile, the camera 121 of<br>
the second body 200 may be used for high resolution (i.e., supporting a relatively<br>
17<br><br>
large number of pixels) in order to capture more detailed (higher quality) images<br>
(or video) which typically do not need to be transmitted immediately.<br>
[0089] A flash 250 and a mirror 255 may be additionally disposed adjacent to the<br>
camera 121 of the second body 205. When an image of the subject is captured<br>
with the camera 121 of the second body 205, the flash 250 illuminates the subject.<br>
The mirror 255 allows the user to see himself when he wants to capture his own<br>
image (self-image capturing) by using the camera 121 of the second body 205.<br>
[0090] The second rear case 235 may further include the audio output module 152.<br>
[0091] The audio output module 152 of the second body may implement a<br>
stereophonic sound function in conjunction with the audio output module 152 of<br>
the first body 200, and may be also used for sending and receiving calls in a<br>
speaker phone mode.<br>
[0092] A broadcast signal receiving antenna 260 may be disposed at one side or<br>
region of the second rear case 235, in addition to an antenna that supports mobile<br>
communications. The antenna 260 can be configured to be retractable from the<br>
second body 235.<br>
[0093] One part of a slide module 265 that slidably combines the first body 200<br>
and the second body 205 may be disposed on the first rear case 225 of the first<br>
body 200.<br>
[0094] The other part of the slide module 265 may be disposed on the second<br>
front case 230 of the second body 205, which may not be exposed as shown in<br>
FIG. 3.<br>
[0095] In the above description, the camera 121 and so on is disposed on the<br>
second body 205, but such configuration is not meant to be limited.<br>
[0096] For example, one or more of the elements (e.g., 260, 121, 250 and 152,<br>
18<br><br>
etc.), which are disposed on the second rear case 235 in the above description,<br>
may be mounted on the first body 200, mainly, on the first rear case 225. In this<br>
case, those elements disposed on the first rear case 225 can be protected (or<br>
covered) by the second body 205 in the closed configuration. In addition, even if<br>
the camera 121 of the second body 205 is not provided, the camera 121 of the<br>
first body 200 may be configured to rotate (or otherwise be moved) to thus allow<br>
image capturing in various directions.<br>
[0097] The mobile terminal 100 as shown in FIGs. 1 to 3 may be configured to<br>
operate within a communication system which transmits data via frames or<br>
packets, including both wired/wireless communication systems and satellite-based<br>
communication systems.<br>
[0098] The communication systems in which the mobile terminal related to the<br>
present invention is operable will now be described with reference to FIG.. 4.<br>
[0099] Such communication systems may utilize different air interfaces and/or<br>
physical layers. For example, such air interfaces utilized by the communication<br>
systems may include frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division<br>
multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), and universal<br>
mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) (In particular, the long term evolution<br>
(LTE) of the UMTS), the global system for mobile communications (GSM), and the<br>
like. By way of non-limiting example only, further description will relate to the<br>
CDMA communication system, but such teachings apply equally to other system<br>
types.<br>
[00100] Referring to Fig. 4, the CDMA wireless communication system may<br>
include a plurality of mobile terminals 100, a plurality of base stations 270, base<br>
station controllers (BSCs) 275, and a mobile switching center (MSC) 280. The<br>
19<br><br>
MSC 280 is configured to interface with a conventional public switch telephone<br>
network (PSTN) 290. The MSC 280 is also configured to interface with the BSCs<br>
275. The BSCs 275 are coupled to the base stations 270 via backhaul lines.<br>
The backhaul lines may be configured according to any of several known<br>
interfaces including, for example, E1/T1, ATM, IP, PPP, Frame Relay, HDSL, ADSL,<br>
or xDSL. It is to be understood that the system may include multiple BSCs 275.<br>
[00101] Each base station 270 may include at least one sector, each sector having<br>
an omnidirectional antenna or an antenna pointing in a particular direction radially<br>
from the base station 270. Alternatively, each sector may include two or more<br>
antennas for diversity reception. Each base station 270 may be configured to<br>
support a plurality of frequency assignments, with each frequency assignment<br>
having a particular spectrum (e.g., 1.25 MHz, 5 MHz, etc.).<br>
[00102] The intersection of a sector and frequency assignment may be referred to<br>
as a CDMA channel. The base stations 270 may also be referred to as base<br>
station transceiver subsystems (BTSs). In this case, the term "base station" may<br>
be used to refer collectively to the BSC 275 and at least one base station 270. The<br>
base stations may also denote "cell sites." Alternatively, individual sectors of a<br>
particular base station 270 may be referred to as cell sites.<br>
[00103] As shown in FIG. 4, a broadcasting transmitter (BT) 295 transmits<br>
broadcast signals to the mobile terminals 100 operating within the system. The<br>
broadcast receiving module 111 as shown in Fig. 1 is provided within the terminal<br>
100 to receive the broadcast signals transmitted by the BT 295.<br>
[00104] Fig. 4 further depicts GPS satellites 300. Such satellites 300 facilitate<br>
locating the position of at least one of the mobile terminals 100. Two satellites<br>
are shown in FIG. 4, but it is understood that useful positioning information (or<br>
20<br><br>
location information) may be obtained with two or less or two or more satellites.<br>
The GPS module 115 as shown in FIG. 1, is typically configured to cooperate with<br>
the satellites 300 to obtain desired location information. Here, it is to be<br>
appreciated that, as well as the GPS technique, any other types of location<br>
tracking technologies may be used to locate the position. In addition, at least one<br>
of the GPS satellites 300 may be selectively or additionally used to handle satellite<br>
DMB transmissions.<br>
[00105] During typical operation of the wireless communication system, the base<br>
stations 270 receive sets of reverse-link signals from various mobile terminals 100.<br>
At this time, the mobile terminals 100 are engaged in a call connection, are<br>
transmitting or receiving messages, or are performing any other communication<br>
operations. Each reverse-link signal received by a particular base station 270 is<br>
processed within the corresponding base station 270. The resulting data is<br>
forwarded to an associated BSC 275. The BSC 275 provides call resource<br>
allocation and mobility management functionality including the orchestration of soft<br>
handoffs between base stations 270. In addition, the BSCs 275 transmits the<br>
received data to the MSC 280, which provides additional transmission services for<br>
interfacing with the PSTN 290. Similarly, the PSTN 290 interfaces with the MSC<br>
280, and the MSC 280 interfaces with the BSCs 275, which in turn control the<br>
base stations 270 to transmit sets of forward-link signals to the mobile terminals<br>
100.<br>
[00106] FIG 5 is a schematic block diagram showing the configuration of an<br>
apparatus for controlling illumination of a backlight related to the present invention;<br>
[00107] The apparatus for controlling illumination of a backlight according to the<br>
present invention may be configured as a single chip or may be configured to be<br>
21<br><br>
included in a driving circuit that applies current to the backlight or switches it. For<br>
example, the backlight illumination controlling apparatus may be configured to be<br>
included in a charge pump circuit to control the backlight of an LCD display unit or<br>
may be configured as a separate luminance control chip. As a matter of course,<br>
besides the charge pump circuit, the backlight illumination controlling apparatus<br>
may be configured to be included in a chip or a circuit associated with controlling<br>
the display unit or illumination of the backlight.<br>
[00108] With reference to FIG. 5, at least one illuminance sensor 500 detects an<br>
ambient illuminance (i.e., the brightness of the surrounding environment) and<br>
outputs current corresponding to the detected illuminance. The illuminance sensor<br>
500 may include a photodiode or a photo-transistor or some other type of<br>
appropriate light sensor, such illuminance sensor 500 may be located<br>
(implemented) at various portions of the mobile terminal (such as near the display<br>
screen) depending upon the particular design of the mobile terminal itself.<br>
[00109] A current/voltage converting unit 410 may converts a current value<br>
outputted from the illuminance sensor 500 into an appropriate voltage and output<br>
the same.<br>
[00110] A temperature compensating unit 420 may correct the voltage value<br>
outputted from the current/voltage converting unit 410. Because the output voltage<br>
varies according to an increase in temperature of the current/voltage converting<br>
unit 410, the output voltage of the current/voltage converting unit 410 should be<br>
corrected by the temperature compensating unit 420.<br>
[00111] For example, when the current/voltage converting unit 410 is configured<br>
by using, a diode, the output voltage varies by about -2mV/0C. due to the<br>
characteristics that an increase in temperature causes a reduction in resistance,<br>
22<br><br>
which results in a lowered output voltage.<br>
[00112] Accordingly, considering the temperature characteristics of the<br>
current/voltage converting unit 410, the temperature compensating unit 420 serves<br>
to perform a correction procedure to maintain a certain (uniform) voltage<br>
proportional to the input voltage.<br>
[00113] Because the voltage value output from the current/voltage converting unit<br>
410 is small, a current regulating unit 430 may amplify the voltage value to have a<br>
particular gain to precisely control current to be outputted to the backlight.<br>
[00114] The current regulating unit 430 may set a minimum illuminance value to<br>
be used for maintaining the brightness of illumination of the backlight at a<br>
minimum level and a maximum illuminance value to be used for maintaining the<br>
brightness of illumination of the backlight at a maximum level by controlling the<br>
current of driving power to be outputted to the backlight according to a change in<br>
illuminance. Alternatively, the current regulating unit 430 may control the current to<br>
be outputted to the backlight according to a proportional expression from which a<br>
current amount according to illuminance can be recognized.<br>
[00115] The current regulating unit 430 may include a first register (REG1) 431 or<br>
other component that sets a maximum illuminance value to be used for<br>
maintaining maximum brightness by allowing a maximum current to flow to the<br>
backlight and a second register (REG2) 432 or other component that sets a<br>
minimum illuminance value to be used for maintaining minimum brightness by<br>
allowing a minimum current to flow to the backlight. The maximum illuminance<br>
value set in the first register 431 is a relative value with respect to the minimum<br>
illuminance value set in the second register 432. The illuminance values may be<br>
set with voltage levels outputted through the temperature compensating unit 420.<br>
23<br><br>
[00116] Namely, provided the maximum illuminance value is set as 100 lux, if the<br>
minimum illuminance value is 10 lux, brightness of illumination of the backlight is<br>
minimized at 10 lux and maximized at 110 lux. Likewise, when the minimum<br>
illuminance value is 20 lux, brightness of illumination of the backlight is minimized<br>
at 20 lux and maximized at 120 lux.<br>
[00117] By adjusting the values set in the first and second registers 431 and 432,<br>
a section in which brightness of illumination of the backlight varies according to<br>
ambient illuminance may be set. Namely, when the ambient illuminance is lower<br>
than the value set in the second register 432, the backlight is driven with a<br>
minimum current, while when the ambient illuminance is higher than an<br>
illuminance value obtained by adding the illuminance value set in the first register<br>
431 to the illuminance set in the second register 432, the backlight is driven with a<br>
maximum current. For example, when the minimum illuminance value is set as 10<br>
lux and the maximum illuminance value is set as 100 lux, the backlight is driven<br>
with the minimum current at 10 lux and driven with the maximum current at 110 lux<br>
obtained by adding 10 lux and 100 lux.<br>
[00118] The difference between the first and second registers 431 and 432 will<br>
now be described with reference to graphs as shown in FIGs. 5 and 6.<br>
[00119] FIG. 6 is a graph showing a method for controlling current to maintain<br>
maximum brightness of illumination of the backlight according to the maximum<br>
illuminance value set in the first register 431. As shown, as the maximum<br>
illuminance value is adjusted in the state that the minimum illuminance value is<br>
fixed, brightness, ranging from the minimum level to the maximum level, of<br>
illumination of the backlight can be precisely_conirolled according to illuminance.<br>
[00120] With reference to FIG. 6, there is shown a difference between the case<br>
24<br><br>
(G1) in which the maximum illuminance value set in the first register 431 is set as<br>
70 lux and the case (G2) in which the maximum illuminance value set in the first<br>
register 431 is 10,000 lux, provided that the minimum illuminance value set in the<br>
second register 432 is fixed as 1 lux. Namely, with the maximum illuminance value<br>
set as 10,000 lux, when a current illuminance is 70 lux, current flowing across the<br>
backlight is about 10mA, and with the maximum illuminance set as 70 lux, when<br>
the current illuminance is 70 lux, current flowing across the backlight is 25mA,<br>
equivalent to the maximum current.<br>
[00121] FIG. 7 is a graph showing a method for controlling current to maintain<br>
minimum brightness of illumination of the backlight according to an illuminance<br>
value set in the second register 432. By adjusting the minimum illuminance value<br>
in a state that the maximum illuminance value is fixed, illuminance for maintaining<br>
the minimum brightness of illumination of the backlight can be simply controlled.<br>
[00122] With reference to FIG 7, there is shown a difference between the case<br>
(G3) in which the minimum illuminance value set in the second register 432 is set<br>
as 1 lux and the case (G4) in which the minimum illuminance value set in the<br>
second register 432 is 1,000 lux, provided that the maximum illuminance value set<br>
in the first register 431 is fixed as 70 lux. Namely, with the minimum illuminance<br>
value set as 1 lux, when a current illuminance is 1 lux, a minimum current flows<br>
across the backlight, and with the minimum illuminance set as 1,000 lux, when the<br>
current illuminance is 1,000 lux, a minimum current flows across the backlight.<br>
[00123] For reference, with the maximum illuminance value fixed as 70 lux, if 1 lux<br>
is set as the minimum illuminance value and a current illuminance is 70 lux,<br>
brighiness of illumination of the backlight is maximized. With the-minimum<br>
illuminance value set as 1,000 lux, if 1,000 lux is set as the minimum illuminance<br>
25<br><br>
value and a current illuminance is 1,070 lux, brightness of illumination of the<br>
backlight is maximized.<br>
[00124] Accordingly, by adjusting the illuminance values set in the first and second<br>
registers 431 and 432, as shown in FIG. 8, the illuminance value for maintaining<br>
the maximum brightness as well as the illuminance value for maintaining the<br>
minimum brightness of illumination of the backlight can be adjusted.<br>
[00125] A limiter 440 as shown in FIG. 5 serves to control the level of voltage<br>
outputted from the current regulating unit 430. The reason of controlling the<br>
voltage level is because when the voltage inputted to a backlight driving unit 600 is<br>
maximized, the current flowing through the backlight is maximized. Namely, when<br>
the maximum current is inputted to the backlight, current consumption would<br>
increase, and if worse, the backlight may be damaged.<br>
[00126] Assuming that a maximum voltage level that may be inputted to the<br>
backlight is 1.15 V, if the voltage outputted from the current regulating unit 430 is<br>
more than 1.15 V, the maximum current would flow to the backlight. Thus, the<br>
output voltage should be limited so as not to be more than the maximum voltage<br>
level.<br>
[00127] The limiter 440 serves to limit the output voltage such that it may not<br>
exceed a voltage level set in a third register 441. The operation characteristics of<br>
the limiter 440 according to the third register 441 will now be described with<br>
reference to the graph as shown in FIG 8.<br>
[00128] With reference to FIG. 9, it is noted that when the voltage level set in the<br>
third register 441 is 1.15 V (equivalent to 1,150 mV), the limiter 440 limits output of<br>
the voltage. With reference to 8, it is noted that when voltage outputted at<br>
about 10,000 lux is maximized as 1.15V, a maximum current is inputted to the<br>
26<br><br>
backlight to maintain illumination of the backlight with the maximum brightness.<br>
[00129] The setting of the illuminance for maintaining the backlight with minimum<br>
brightness and the illuminance for maintaining the backlight with maximum<br>
brightness is effective, provided illuminance does not change suddenly.<br>
[00130] However, in actual use, the illuminance of the surrounding environment<br>
may change suddenly.<br>
[00131] For example, when the user enters a dark tunnel or a subway (underpass)<br>
from a bright environment or when the user goes out to a dark outdoor<br>
environment from a bright indoor environment at night, the surrounding<br>
illuminance will change suddenly from a positive value to a negative value.<br>
Conversely, when the user exits a dark tunnel or when the user goes out of his<br>
house to a bright playground or street, the surrounding illuminance will change<br>
suddenly from a negative value to a positive value.<br>
[00132] If the illumination of the backlight changes from minimum brightness to<br>
maximum brightness according to a sharp change in the illuminance as described<br>
above, or conversely, if illumination of the backlight changes from maximum<br>
brightness to minimum brightness, the user may erroneously think that backlight of<br>
his mobile phone is broken. Or, when the ambient illuminance temporarily changes,<br>
such as when the mobile phone camera flash goes off during picture taking,<br>
illumination of the backlight may be over-sensitively reacted thereto and controlled<br>
in an unnecessary manner. Thus, the backlight needs to be more appropriately<br>
controlled such that its brightness changes naturally even if the ambient<br>
illuminance changes suddenly. Also, the reaction of the backlight to the temporary<br>
change in ambient illuminance should be controlled such that backlight illuminance<br>
changes are minimized.<br>
27<br><br>
[00133] With reference to FIG. 5, a delay unit 450 may serve to control such that<br>
brightness of illumination of the backlight can change more gradually during a<br>
particular delay time in spite of the sharp change in illuminance. Namely, the delay<br>
unit 450 may control the amount of current to make the brightness of illumination<br>
of the backlight change in a gradual manner within the delay time.<br>
[00134] For example, if such delay time is not set, when ambient illuminance<br>
changes from minimum illuminance to maximum illuminance, brightness of<br>
illumination of the backlight would rapidly change from minimum brightness to<br>
maximum brightness. If, however, the delay time is set (for example, as 10<br>
seconds), brightness of the illumination can change in a gradual manner during<br>
ten seconds. In the reverse case, with the delay time set, brightness of illumination<br>
of the backlight can change in a gradual manner to minimum brightness during ten<br>
seconds.<br>
[00135] The delay unit 450 may include a fourth register (REG4) 451 or other<br>
component that sets a delay time to prevent brightness of illumination of the<br>
backlight from changing suddenly when ambient illuminance changes from a<br>
negative value to a positive value, and a fifth register (REG5) 452 or other<br>
component that sets a delay time to prevent brightness of illumination of the<br>
backlight from changing suddenly when the ambient illuminance changes from the<br>
positive value to the negative value. Here, the positive value and the negative<br>
value refer to a relative height of illuminance. For example, when illuminance<br>
changes from 10 lux to 20 lux, it may mean that the illuminance changes from a<br>
negative value to a positive value, and conversely, when illuminance changes from<br>
20 lux to 10 lux it may mean that the illuminance changes from a positive value to<br>
a negative value.<br>
28<br><br>
[00136] In addition to the delay time for changing brightness of illumination of the<br>
backlight, a variation of illuminance to which the delay time should be applied may<br>
be set.<br>
[00137] For example, it is assumed that an illuminance variation between a<br>
minimum illuminance value and a maximum illuminance value is 100% and a<br>
variation of illuminance to which the delay time should be applied is 10%. If a<br>
current illuminance value has changed by smaller than 10% compared with a<br>
previous illuminance value, brightness of illumination of the backlight is adjusted<br>
without a time delay, and only when the current illuminance value has changed by<br>
larger than 10% compared with the previous illuminance value, the delay time is<br>
applied to make brightness of the illumination of the backlight change in a gradual<br>
manner.<br>
[00138] FIG. 10 is a schematic block diagram showing the configuration of the<br>
mobile terminal including the apparatus for controlling illumination of the backlight<br>
related to the present invention.<br>
[00139] With reference to FIG 10, when the user presses a power key (not shown)<br>
of the user input unit 130 to supply power to boot the mobile terminal 100, power<br>
is supplied to the controller 180 and a backlight controller 400. As mentioned<br>
above, the backlight controller 400 is separately configured, namely, not as a part<br>
of the controller 180, brightness of illumination of the backlight can be controlled<br>
while the mobile terminal 100 is being booted.<br>
[00140] The controller 180 may monitor whether or not the backlight controller 400<br>
operates normally. Namely, the controller 180 may monitor whether or not<br>
luminance control operation is normally-parformed according to illuminance upon<br>
receiving voltage outputted from the current regulating unit 430 via a particular<br>
29<br><br>
terminal (port) LMON. The voltage outputted via the particular terminal LMON may<br>
be received and processed by an ADC (Analog Digital Converter) of the controller<br>
180.<br>
[00141] The set values in the registers included in each element of the backlight<br>
controller 400 may be changed according to communication with the controller 180.<br>
The controller 180 and the backlight controller 400 may communicate via a<br>
particular communication bus I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit). For this purpose, the<br>
backlight controller 400 may include a I2C communication port (not shown).<br>
Namely, values set in each register of the backlight controller 400 may well be<br>
changed even after manufacturing of the mobile terminal is completed as well as<br>
in the course of manufacturing. For example, the set values of the particular<br>
registers can be changed through communication when the mobile terminal is<br>
being booted or operated.<br>
[00142] In other words, when a user interface is configured to change the set<br>
values of the registers, power consumption or illumination of the backlight can be<br>
controlled in various ways as desired by the user.<br>
[00143] In addition, the controller 180 may inform the user through such<br>
monitoring that the backlight controller 400 normally operates. For example, an<br>
indicator 700 may be configured at the body of the mobile terminal 100 and<br>
controlled according to a change in the luminance of a backlight 154. Or, an<br>
operation state may be displayed by using an icon or the like on a particular region<br>
(e.g., an indicator display part) of the display unit 151 of the output unit 150. As an<br>
element of the output unit 150, the backlight 154 may include a plurality of LEDs.<br>
[00144]As the exemplary embodiments may be implemented in several forms<br>
without departing from the characteristics thereof, it should also be understood<br>
30<br><br>
that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the<br>
foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed<br>
broadly within its scope as defined in the appended claims. Therefore, various<br>
