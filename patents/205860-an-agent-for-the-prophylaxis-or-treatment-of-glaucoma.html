				<td>[Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for glaucoma having excellent intraocular pressure lowering action.<br>
[Background of the invention]<br>
b-Blockers (timolol maleate, carteolol, etc.), prostaglandin type compounds (isopropyl unoprostone and latanoprost) and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (dorzolamide hydrochloride) have been mainly used as agents for the treatment of glaucoma. Moreover, an a 1-blocker (bunazosin hydrochloride) and an ab-blocker (nipradilol) are now at the stage of clinical trials or application for approval.<br>
There are reports (for example, EP795326, EP631780, WO95/21609, W091/15206, etc.) that angiotensin II antagonists are useful agents for the treatment of glaucoma. Among angiotensin H antagonists, only CGP-48933 has been subjected to clinical trial. It was reported that its effect for glaucoma was insufficient (Eur. J. Ophthalmol. 1997, Jan-Mar; 7(1): 35-9) and the development of it has been stopped since then.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
The present inventors have carried out an extensive investigation on the preparation of agents for the prophylaxis or treatment of glaucoma having superior intraocular pressure lowering effect and on their pharmacological action. As a result, it has been found that intraocular pressure lowering action can be potentiated by using an angiotensin II antagonist in combination with at least one compound selected from adrenaline receptor blockers, prostaglandins and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,<br>
leading to the completion of the present invention.<br>

The amount of the pharmaceutical composition varies, depending upon the symptom and age of the patient and the administration route. It is, however, desirable to orally administer the active ingredients in an amount ranging from 0.01 mg/kg body weight (preferably 0.1 mg/kg body) as a lower limit to 100 mg/kg body weight (preferably 50 mg/kg body weight) as an upper limit once. While it is desirable to intravenously administer it in an amount ranging from 0.01 mg/kg body weight (preferably 0.05 mg/kg body weight) as a lower limit to 100 mg/kg body weight (preferably 50 mg/kg body weight) as an upper limit once. In either case, the active ingredients are preferably administered once to several times a day.<br>
In the prophylactic and therapeutic agent for glaucoma according to the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition for separate or successive use of the angiotensin II antagonist and at least one compound selected from the adrenaline receptor blockers, prostaglandins and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be prepared by individually formulating the compounds serving as active ingredients (that is, angiotensin II antagonist and at least one compound selected from the adrenaline receptor blockers, prostaglandins and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). The formulation can be carried out in accordance with the above-described methods. At this time, these formulations may be in the same form or different form. Anyway, forms suitable for topical application to the eyes are especially preferred.<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described in further detail by Examples. It should however be bome in mind that the present invention is not limited to or by<br>
them.<br>
[Examples] [Example 1]<br>
Using New Zealand White Rabbits having body weights of 2 to 3 kg, ocular hypertension models were prepared in accordance with the method of Kurihara, et al. (Jpn. J. Ocular Pharmacology, 4,62-64(1990)) and the intraocular pressure lowering action of the test compounds was investigated.<br>
Described specifically, the rabbits were maintained under general anesthesia and their intraocular pressure was measured using a tonometer ("Alcon Applanation Pneumatonography"; manufactured by Alcon). After instillation of local anesthetics into the eyes of the rabbits, 0.1 ml of a 5% sodium chloride solution were injected into their vitreous bodies through a 30 gauge needle. An increase in the intraocular pressure was confirmed 30 minutes after injection, followed by administration of 50 ml of an eye drop solution containing the test compound. Their intraocular pressure was then measured for 2 hours at intervals of 30 minutes (single administration test).<br>
In the combined administration test, after confirmation of an increase in the intraocular pressure, 50 ml of the solution of the first test compound was administered, followed by the administration of the same amount of the solution of the second test compound after 5 minutes. After the' second administration, the intraocular pressure was measured for 2 hours at intervals of 30 minutes.<br>
The below-described compound A was dissolved in a suitable amount of an sodium hydroxide solution and this solution was used as a test compound. With regards to the below-described compounds B to E, commercially available eye drops were employed as the test compound.<br>
Sankyo/FJFP200051/FP200051s.doc                       P83452/FP-200051(PCT)/Eng]ish Translation of Specification/tsa/22.04.02<br>
16<br>
Compound A:<br>
Compound B: timolol maleate Compound C: isopropyl unoprostone Compound D: latanoprost Compound E: dorzolamide hydrochloride<br>
When Compound A which is an angiotensin II antagonist was administered in combination with anyone of Compounds B, C, D and E, intraocular pressure lowering action was potentiated.<br>
[Example 2] Intraocular pressure lowering action (2)<br>
Using a tonometer ("Alcon Applanation Pneumatonography; manufactured by Alcon), the intraocular pressure of each of New Zealand White Rabbits having body weights of 2 to 3 kg was measured (without anesthesia), followed by administration of 50 ml of a test compound in the form of eye drops. The intraocular pressure was then measured for 4 hours at intervals of one hour (single administration test).<br>
In the combined administration test, after measurement of the intraocular pressure, 50 ml of the first test compound solution was administered, followed by the administration of the same amount of the second test compound solution after 5 minutes. After the second administration, the intraocular pressure was measured for 4 hours at intervals of 1 hour.<br>
Also in this Example, the same test compounds as described in Example 1 were employed.<br>
When Compound A which is an angiotensin II antagonist was administered in combination with any one of Compounds B, C, D and E, intraocular pressure lowering action was potentiated.<br>
[Example 3] Intraocular pressure lowering test (3)<br>
After measurement of the intraocular pressure as in Example 2, 50 ml of a<br>

17<br>
solution of test compound 1 was instilled into the eyes, followed by administration of the same amount of the solution of test compound 2 after 5 minutes. Four hours after the second administration, the intraocular pressure was measured and the change ratio of the intraocular pressure was determined by the below-described equation:<br>
The change ratio of intraocular pressure (%) = [(intraocular pressure after administration of eye drops - intraocular pressure before administration of eye drops) / intraocular pressure before administration of eye drops] x 100<br>
In this Example, the same test compounds as Example 1 were employed. Results are shown below in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
Table 1.          Combined administration of Compound A and Compound C<br>
Test compound 1	Test compound 2	Change ratio (%) of intraocular pressure<br>
Physiological saline	Physiological saline	7.3 ± 3.7<br>
Compound A (4%)	Physiological saline	11.4 ±5.5<br>
Physiological saline	Compound C (0.12%)	-2.4 ±9.1<br>
Compound A (4%)	Compound C (0.12%)	-15.3 ±4.5<br>

Physiological saline	Compound D(0.005%)	17.2 ±8.8<br>
Compound A (4%)	Compound D(0.005%)	-8.2 ±4.7<br>
As is apparent from the Tables 1 and 2, synergistic intraocular pressure lowering action was observed when the angiotensin II antagonist (Compound A) and the prostaglandin (Compound C or D) were administered in combination.<br>
Sankyo/FJFP200051/FP200051s.doc                       P83452/FP-200051(PCT)/Eng]ish Translation of Specification/tsa/22.04.02<br>
18<br>
[Example 4] Intraocular pressure lowering test (4)<br>
An ocular hypertension model was made as Example 1. After confirmation of an increase in the intraocular pressure, 50 ml of a test compound 1 was instilled to the eyes, followed by application of the same amount of a test compound 2 into the eyes after 5 minutes. After this second administration, the intraocular pressure was measured for 2 hours at intervals of 1 hour. Intraocular pressure lowering was determined by the below-described equation.<br>
Decrease in intraocular pressure (mmHg) - (intraocular pressure after instillation of a compound group - intraocular pressure before instillation of the compound group) - (intraocular pressure after instillation of a control group -intraocular pressure before instillation of the control group)<br>
The term "control group" in the above-described formula means a group to which physiological saline was administered to the eyes instead of each of the test compound 1 and test compound 2. Groups other than this control group are a compound group.<br>
Also in this Example, the same test compounds as described in Example 1 were employed. The results are shown below in Table 3.<br>
Table 3.          Combined administration of Compound A with Compound B<br>
Test compound 1	Test compound 2	Decrease in intraocular pressure (mmHg) [Time after instillation (min)]		<br>
		0	60	120<br>
Physiological saline	Physiological saline	0	0	0<br>
Compound A (1%)	Physiological saline	0.0 ±2.1	-1.7 ±2.2	-3.4 ±1.7<br>
Physiological saline	Compound B (0.25%)	0.0 ±1.5	-2.0 ± 3.5	-1.9 ±3.2<br>
Compound A 1%)	Compound B (0.25%)	0.0 ± 0.9	-5.0 ± 2.4	-7.4 ±1.8<br>
As is apparent from Table 3, stronger intraocular pressure lowering action was<br>
