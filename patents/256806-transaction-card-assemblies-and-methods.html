TRANSACTION CARD ASSEMBLIES AND METHODS<br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
 The present invention claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/638,079, filed December 20, 2004, entitled Transaction Card Assemblies, Systems and<br>
Methods of Making, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the complete disclosure<br>
of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention is related to transaction cards, and more specifically, to<br>
transaction card assemblies, systems, and methods of making.<br>
 Transaction cards, such as credit cards, debit cards, membership cards, stored, value<br>
cards, and the like, are widely used. Such cards may include a variety of different indicia to<br>
identify the card and other features, such as the card issuer, the customer, or the like<br>
depending in part on the type of card. The information may be printed on the card using<br>
alphanumeric characters, graphics, or the like, or may be embossed into the card.<br>
Alternatively, some or all the information is encoded on the card, such as in a magnetic strip<br>
attached to the card.<br>
 Some transaction cards are coupled to a carrier having additional information. For<br>
example, stored value cards sold in retail locations may have a carrier containing promotional<br>
information, and other inducements to buy the card. The cards may be attached to the carrier,<br>
such as with an adhesive strip. Many transaction cards are coupled to their carriers in a way<br>
that makes reading those cards difficult using standard point-of-sale devices. For example,<br>
the data included on the card may be on the side of the card affixed to the card carrier.<br>
Further, the card that has data exposed runs the risk of damage to the data. Inadvertent<br>
separation of the card from the carrier also may present problems. Improvements are desired.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 The present invention is related to transaction cards, and more specifically, to<br>
transaction card assemblies, systems, and methods of making. In one embodiment, a<br>
transaction card assembly according to the present invention includes a carrier and a card<br><br>
integrally formed within and peripherally engaging the carrier. The card is adapted to be<br>
removed from the carrier, and includes a magnetic strip disposed on the card.<br>
 In one aspect, the earner assembly and the card are substantially co-planar when the<br>
card peripherally engages the carrier. In some aspects, the card has generally rectangular first<br>
and second surfaces spaced apart by a peripheral edge, with four sides of the peripheral edge<br>
engaging the carrier assembly. In this manner, the card is protected by the carrier prior to its<br>
separation from the earner. In one aspect, the card is a punch-out portion of the carrier. This<br>
may occur, for example, when an interface between the carrier and the card includes a scored<br>
region in the carrier, with the scored region defining a periphery of the card. In one aspect,<br>
the card peripherally engages the earner in a press fit arrangement. This may occur, for<br>
example, when two opposing edges of the card peripherally engage the carrier to frictionally<br>
retain the card within the carrier. In some aspects, a wrapping such as a shrink wrap cover is<br>
disposed over the card and over a portion or all of the card carrier. In this manner, the card is<br>
further protected and retained in the carrier.<br>
 In alternative aspects, the magnetic strip includes one track, two tracks, three tracks,<br>
or more, on which data may be encoded. In some aspects, the magnetic strip includes two<br>
tracks having a same data set encoded therein. The data set may include a card identifier, a<br>
card value amount, customer information, card vendor information, and the like.<br>
 In a preferred embodiment, the magnetic strip is positioned a first distance from a<br>
card edge and is positioned a second distance from an edge of the carrier, with the card edge<br>
disposed between the magnetic strip and carrier edge. The magnetic strip may include two<br>
spaced apart tracks, with the spacing between the two tracks being substantially the same as a<br>
difference between the second distance and the first distance. In some aspects, the magnetic<br>
strip first track is positioned to be read by a point-of-sale device when the card and carrier are<br>
engaged, and the second track is positioned to be read by the point-of-sale device after the<br>
card is separated from the carrier.<br>
 In another embodiment, a transaction card assembly includes a card carrier having a<br>
card integrally formed within. The card peripherally engages the card carrier and is adapted<br>
to be removed from the card carrier. An encodable strip is disposed on the card. The strip<br>
has first and second encodable tracks. The first encodable track is positioned to be read by a<br>
point-of-sale device when the card is engaged with the card carrier, and the second encodable<br><br>
track is positioned to be read by the point-of-sale device after the card is separated from the<br>
carrier.<br>
 The present invention further provides methods of making transaction card<br>
assembly combinations. One such method includes forming a card carrier from a sheet of<br>
material, and forming one or more score lines within the card carrier. The score line defines<br>
a periphery of a card that is adapted for removal from the card carrier. In this manner, the<br>
card is peripherally engaged by the carrier to protect it and prevent or help prevent an<br>
unintended removal from the carrier. The method includes applying an encodable strip to a<br>
surface of the card. In one aspect, removal of the card from the card carrier creates a hole in<br>
the card carrier, which may correspond of the size of the removed card. In same aspects, the<br>
card may be imprinted, embossed, or otherwise provided with a data set. The card may be<br>
reinserted into the card carrier, with the card frictionally engaging the carrier to help maintain<br>
a coupling of the card and carrier. A wrapping or cover such as shrink wrap also may be used<br>
to maintain the coupled card and carrier arrangement.<br>
 The method may include applying the encodable strip to a portion of the card carrier<br>
in general alignment with the encodable strip portion on the card surface. In this manner, the<br>
encodable strip, which may include a magnetic strip, a uniform product code, or the like,<br>
spans the card and at least a portion of the carrier. The encodable strip includes, in one<br>
embodiment, first and second encodable tracks spaced apart from one another by a gap.<br>
 In one aspect, the gap is a same distance as a distance between an edge of the card<br>
to an edge of the card carrier. In this manner, the encodable strip can be read by a point-of-<br>
sale device whether or not the card is coupled to or engaged with the carrier. In some<br>
aspects, the first and second tracks are encoded with a same data set. In this manner, the<br>
point-of-sale device reads the same data whether it reads the card with or without the carrier<br>
attached to the card. Further, the card and carrier can be purchased together, with the card<br>
being read by a point of sale device, and maintained as a single piece. In this manner, the<br>
card may be given as a gift or the like after purchase without disengaging the card from the<br>
carrier.<br>
 Other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more<br>
fully apparent from the following detailed description, the appended claims and the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
	 Cards of the present invention may be a wide variety of cards sent to customers or<br>
available for purchase by the consuming public. Cards could be used for functions similar to<br>
or the same as those described in pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 9/971,303, filed<br>
October 3, 2001, entitled Stored Value Cards and Methods for Their Issuance; U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/421,604, filed April 22, 2003, entitled Multi-Purse Card Systems<br>
and Methods; and U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/744,888, filed December 23, 2003,<br>
entitled Stored Value Lottery Card and Methods., each of which are assigned to the assignee<br>
of the present invention, with the complete disclosures of each being incorporated herein by<br>
reference for all purposes. In some embodiments, cards of the present invention include<br><br>
ValueLink® gift cards manufactured and/or distributed by First Data Corporation of<br>
Englewood, Colorado.<br>
 Refemng to Figs. 1 and 2, transaction card assemblies according to an embodiment<br>
of the present invention will be described. Fig. 1 depicts a sheet of material 100 from which<br>
a plurality of transaction card assemblies 110 are manufactured. Material 100 may be a wide<br>
range of materials within the scope of the present invention including, without limitation,<br>
plastic, nylon, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), cardboard stock, paper laminated with a plastic, and<br>
the like. In one embodiment, sheet 100 comprises a material similar to that used with gift<br>
cards, credit cards, ATM cards, and the like. In one embodiment, sheet of material 100 is<br>
formed having a desired or acceptable thickness. Transaction card assemblies 110 arc formed<br>
from sheet 100 using a punch dye, punch press, or other device designed to cut or remove<br>
assemblies 110 from sheet 100. In some embodiments, complete rows or entire sheets 100 of<br>
assemblies 110 arc formed in a single stroke of the punch dye. While Fig. 1 depicts<br>
transaction card assemblies 110 having spaces between them, the amount of space between<br>
adjacent assemblies 110 or adjacent rows of assemblies 110 may vary from that depicted.<br>
Further, in some embodiments transaction card assemblies 110 have no space between<br>
adjacent assemblies 110.<br>
 Fig. 2 depicts a transaction card assembly 110 manufactured from sheet 100. In one<br>
embodiment, assembly 110 includes a hole 130 formed therethrough. Mole 130 may be used<br>
to hang assembly 110 from a J-hook or other point-of-purchase display. As shown in Fig. 2,<br>
assembly 100 includes a card carrier 120 and a card 140. In one embodiment, carrier 120 and<br>
card 140 arc formed from sheet 100 and therefore comprise a same material. Card 140, in<br>
one embodiment, is formed within card carrier 120, with card 140 peripherally engaging card<br>
carrier 120. In one embodiment, card 140 comprises a standard CR80 card, although other<br>
size cards also fall within the scope of the present invention. Thus, in one embodiment card<br>
140 is generally rectangular in shape having four edges and two opposing surfaces, an upper<br>
surface and a lower surface. Card surfaces may be printed, embossed, or otherwise provided<br>
with a wide range of information, including card issuer or customer identification<br>
information, such as a name, a logo, terms and conditions, or the like; a card expiration date;<br>
counterfeit protection measures such as a hologram; and the like.<br>
 In one embodiment, card 140 includes an encodable strip 150 disposed on a portion<br>
of card 140. For example, encodable strip may be disposed on a rear surface of card 140. In<br><br>
one embodiment, encodable strip 150 extends beyond the surface of card 140 to include end<br>
portions 152 formed on card carrier 120. In one embodiment, encodable strip end portions<br>
152 are generally aligned with the portion of encodable strip 150 on card 140. In some<br>
embodiments, encodable strip 150 is formed on card 140 after transaction card assemblies<br>
110 are removed from sheet of material 100. In other embodiments, encodable strips 150 are<br>
formed on sheet of material 110 prior to the separation of action card assemblies 110<br>
therefrom.<br>
 As shown in Fig. 3 A, card 140 is adapted to peripherally engage carrier 120, and in<br>
a preferred embodiment, is disposed within carrier 120. Card 140 has a peripheral edge 142<br>
which engages or is coupled to edge 122 of card carrier 120. In one embodiment, all four<br>
peripheral edges of card 140 engage carrier 120 to couple the two together. In other<br>
embodiments, at least one side, at least two sides, or at least three sides of peripheral edge<br>
142 engage card carrier edge 122. In still another embodiment, only a portion of one or more-<br>
sides of peripheral edge 142 engage card carrier edge 122. In still another embodiment, one<br>
or more corners of peripheral edge 142 engage card carrier edge 122. The engaged carrier<br>
120 and card 140 are generally co-planar in some embodiments, such as is shown in Fig. 3A.<br>
Preferably, card 140 can be separated from carrier 120, for subsequent use by a customer or<br>
card recipient.<br>
In one embodiment, peripheral edge 142 of card 140 is formed by creating a scored<br>
region within carrier 120. As shown in Fig. 3B and 3C, one or more score lines 150 may be<br>
formed within assembly 110, so as to provide a separation line between carrier 120 and card<br>
140. In some embodiments, score line 1 50 is created from a single side or surface of<br>
transaction card assembly 110 (Fig. 313). In an alternative embodiment, score line 150 is<br>
formed from opposing surfaces of transaction card assembly 110 (Fig. 3C). In one<br>
embodiment, score lines 150 are formed simultaneous with the separation of transaction card<br>
assemblies 110 from sheet 100. In alternative embodiments, score lines 150 are formed<br>
before and/or after the separation of transaction card assemblies 110 from sheet 100.<br>
 Score line(s) 150 create a weakened interface between carrier 120 and card 140,<br>
allowing transaction cards 140 to be removed from card carriers 120. The removal of card<br>
140 from carrier 120 may be accomplished by pressing on card 140 and/or carrier 120. Score<br>
line(s) 150 break, to allow card 140 to be removed from carrier 120. In one embodiment,<br>
card 140 is a punch-out card that snaps, or disengages from carrier 120. In one embodiment,<br><br>
the removal of card 140 from carrier 120 leaves a hole in carrier 120 substantially the same<br>
size and shape as card 140.<br>
 In another embodiment, an edge 124 of carrier 120 is first removed, and then card<br>
140 is removed from the remaining portion of carrier 120. The removal of edge 124 may be<br>
facilitated, for example, by extending a score line 154 beyond card edge 142, to opposing<br>
edges 126 of carrier 120. In this manner, a portion of earner 120 is removed, to facilitate the<br>
subsequent removal of card 140 from the remaining portion of carrier 120. In another<br>
embodiment, a fold line or score line 154 exists in card carrier 120 to help bend a first portion<br>
of card carrier 120 relative to a second portion of card carrier 120 that remains engaged to<br>
card 140. The fold line or score line may, for example, be aligned to generally bisect card<br>
140 location within carrier 120 as opposed to being aligned with score line 150 or 154. In<br>
some embodiments, the fold line or separate score line extends between two opposing edges<br>
126 of card carrier 120. Alternatively, the fold line runs generally parallel to opposing edges<br>
126. In this manner, first portion of card carrier 120 is disengaged from card 140, and then<br>
the second portion of card carrier 120 is disengaged from card 140. As a result, card 140 is<br>
separated from card carrier 120 in two or more steps. The peripheral edge engagement<br>
between carrier 120 and card 140 prevents or helps prevent an accidental or unintended<br>
removal of card 140 from carrier 120. In this manner, transaction card assembly 110 is<br>
formed and remains a single piece for a desired period of time, such as during the display of<br>
card assembly 110 prior to purchase.<br>
 Fig. 7 depicts a transaction card assembly 700 according to another embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In this embodiment, assembly 700 includes a card carrier 720 and a<br>
card 740 frictionally engaging carrier 720. An optional hole 730 formed through card earner<br>
720 permits card carrier 720 to be hung on a point-of-purchase display in some embodiments.<br>
Card 740 may be formed from a same sheet of material as card carrier 720, but is further<br>
separated from carrier 720. In this manner, card 740 may be removed from carrier 720 and<br>
personalized with a desired data set. The data set may include a wide range of information<br>
including, without limitation, merchant information, customer information, account numbers,<br>
advertising, card value information, and the like. Card 740 is returned to the same or<br>
different card carrier 720, and maintained within card carrier 720. In one embodiment, card<br>
740 is reinserted into a hole 710 in earner 720 from which card 740 was removed. In this<br>
manner, two opposing surfaces of card 740 can be viewed by a potential customer prior to<br>
purchase of card assembly 700. Further, information may be read from one or both surfaces<br><br>
of card 740 by a point-of-sale device, a sales clerk, or the like, in order to facilitate the sale of<br>
card 740 and/or the activation of card 740.<br>
 In one embodiment, card 740 is at least partially retained by card carrier 720<br>
through the frictional engagement of one or more edges of card 740 and the corresponding<br>
edges of hole 710 in card carrier 720. For example, as shown in Fig. 7, in one embodiment<br>
two opposing edges of card 740 engage carrier 720. In this manner, card 720 is securely<br>
maintained relative to card carrier 720. As shown in Fig. 7, in one embodiment an upper<br>
edge 742 and a lower edge 744 of card 740 engage card carrier 720. In this embodiment,<br>
card 740 maintains its alignment relative to an edge 725 of card carrier 720. As a result, an<br>
cnocodable stripe on card 740 can be mainatained a known distance form edge 725 as further<br>
described below.<br>
 Side edges 746 of card 740 are shown spaced from the corresponding edges of card<br>
carrier 720, and more specifically, from the interior side edges of hole 710 formed in card<br>
carrier 720. In alternative embodiments, one or more side edges 746 engage card carrier 720<br>
to help retain card 740 and card earner 720. Card 740 and carrier 720 also may be<br>
frictionally coupled at portions of sides 742-746, at the card comers, or some combination<br>
thereof. Further, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the use of the terms<br>
upper, lower, right, left, side, and the like may vary within the scope of the present invention<br>
depending in part upon the orientation of transfer card assembly 700.<br>
 In a particular embodiment, card 740 is press fit into hole 710 in card earner 720.<br>
In this manner, the customer can readily remove card 740 from carrier 720 with the<br>
application of pressure to card 740 relative to carrier 720. Card 740 also may pop out of hole<br>
710 when carrier 720 is bent. In another embodiment, a cover wrap 760 is disposed over at<br>
least a portion of card assembly 700 to help retain card 740 with carrier 720. As shown in<br>
Fig. 7, cover wrap 760 may be formed over a portion of carrier 720 having hole 710 and card<br>
740. Alternatively, cover wrap 760 may be formed over the entire transaction card assembly<br>
700. In some embodiments, cover wrap 760 is a shrink wrap cover, and may include, for<br>
example, a see-through plastic or film. Other materials also may be used. In one<br>
embodiment, card 740 can be read by a point-of-sale device, as further described below,<br>
while attached to carrier 720 or separated from carrier 740. Further, in one embodiment card<br>
740 can be read by a point-of-sale device with or without cover wrap 760. Cover wrap 760<br><br>
may include advertising or other information the merchant or card issuer wishes to display to<br>
the consuming public.<br>
 With reference to Figs. 4 A and 4B, a particular embodiment of the present invention<br>
will be described. Fig. 4A depicts a transaction card 440, and Fig. 4D depicts transaction<br>
card 440 engaged with a card carrier 420. In some embodiments, cards 440 and carriers 420<br>
are similar or identical to cards 140 and carriers 120. Card 440 includes an encodable strip<br>
450. In this embodiment, encodable strip 450 comprises a magnetic strip, also referred to as<br>
a magstripe. Magnetic strip 450 is comprised of a large number of tiny iron-based magnetic<br>
particles disposed in a plastic-like film. Each particle can be magnetized in cither a north or<br>
suth pole direction to maintain desired information. The information is laid down on<br>
magnetic strip 450 in tracks, such as tracks governed by 1SO/IEC Standard 7811. Generally,<br>
a wide variety of information may be stored in magnetic strip 450, and the issuer of card 440<br>
has the option of deciding at least some of the information contained therein. For example,<br>
magnetic strip 450 may contain merchant identification, customer identification, a card or<br>
account identifier, an expiration date, card monetary values or limits, usage records, a<br>
password or personal identification number (PIN), and the like. In this manner, cards 440<br>
having magnetic strips 450 can be fashioned to contain desired information in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
 In one embodiment, magnetic strip 450 includes a First track 452 and a second track<br>
454 separated by a gap 456. As shown, tracks 452 and 454 are generally parallel to a lower<br>
edge 442 of transaction card 440. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that edge<br>
442 may in alternative embodiments be an upper edge, a side edge, or the like depending on<br>
the orientation of card 440. As can be seen in Fig. 4A, first track 452 is spaced a distance<br>
460 from edge 442. First track 452 has a width generally corresponding to the difference<br>
between a distance 462 and distance 460 as shown in Fig. 4A. Gap 456 corresponds to the<br>
difference between a distance 464 and distance 462 as shown in Fig. 4A. Second track 454 is<br>
positioned distance 464 from edge 442 of card 440. The width or thickness of second track<br>
454 is the difference between a distance 466 and distance 464 that measures how far the<br>
edges of track 454 are from card edge 442. In some embodiments, distances or spacings 460-<br>
466 correspond to appropriate ANSI/ISO standards, including ANSI/ISO document 781 1-2-<br>
2001. In one particular embodiment, distance 460 is 0.228 inches, distance 462 is 0.328<br>
inches, distance 464 is 0.358 inches, and distance 466 is 0.458 inches. In this embodiment,<br>
first track 452 and second track 454 are spaced a known distance from card edge 442. In this<br><br>
manner, card 440 is read using a point-of-sale device by sliding or moving card 440 past a<br>
read head in the point of sale device. Second track 454 is positioned so that the point-of-sale<br>
device reads the data stored in second track 454.<br>
 Fig. 4B depicts card 440 engaged with card carrier 420. Card edge 442 is formed a<br>
distance 470 from a lower edge 422 of carrier 420. Again, lower edge 422 may be an upper<br>
edge, a side edge, or the like depending on the orientation of carrier 420. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, distance 470 generally corresponds to a spacing 480 between first track 452 and<br>
second track 454. In one embodiment, spacing 480 is the difference between distances 464<br>
and 460 shown in Fig. 4A. Further, for embodiments in which tracks 452 and 454 have the<br>
same width, spacing 480 also corresponds to the difference between distances 466 and 462.<br>
 By defining the physical relationship between card 440 and carrier 420 as described<br>
in conjunction with Figs. 4A and 4B, data may be read from a desired track 452, 454 by a<br>
point-of-sale device. More specifically, sliding or engaging card 440 with a point-of-sale<br>
device will cause data from second track 454 to be read when the card is separate from the<br>
carrier (Fig. 4A). Similarly, data will be read from first track 452 when the card and carrier<br>
arc engaged, and the associated transaction card assembly is slid or other-wise read by a point-<br>
of sale device. This is accomplished, at least in part, by forming distance 470 to correspond<br>
to spacing 480 between first and second tracks 452, 454. Thus, for the specific numerical<br>
embodiment described in conjunction with Fig. 4A, gap 480 and spacing 470 correspond to<br>
about 0.130 inches. In this manner, first track 452 is iead using a point-of-sale device when<br>
card 440 is engaged with carrier 420.<br>
 In one embodiment, at least a portion of first and second tracks 452, 454 are<br>
encoded with a same data set. The data set may include a card identifier, a card value<br>
amount, customer information, card vendor information, and the like. In this manner, a<br>
point-of-sale device reading card 440 retrieves the same data or at least some of the same data<br>
whether card 440 is coupled to carrier 420 or separated therefrom prior to reading. In one<br>
embodiment, an encoding device (not shown) includes appropriate software lo encode two<br>
tracks on card 440 with at least some of the same data in a format readable by a point-of-sale<br>
device. In some embodiments, magnetic strip 450 includes a third track (not shown). The<br>
third track may lie further from card edge 442 than first and second tracks 452, 454.<br>
Alternatively, third track is positioned closer to edge 442 than first track 452. It will be<br><br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that the number of tracks may vary from the prescribed<br>
one, two, or three tracks within the scope of the present invention.<br>
 In an alternative embodiment, second track 454 and the third track are positioned to<br>
function as described above, with one of the tracks readable when card 440 is separate from<br>
carrier 420, and the other track readable when card 440 is engaged with carrier 420. In one<br>
embodiment, magnetic strip 450 is positioned closer to or adjacent card edge 442, with<br>
second track 454 and the third track operating as the two readable tracks described above. In<br>
this embodiment, the third track is positioned further from edge 442 than second track 454.<br>
First track 452 may contain additional data in the same or a different format, or may not<br>
contain data, Alternatively, first track 452 contains data in conformance with various<br>
ANSI/ISO standards.<br>
 The data encoded in tracks 452, 454 can have a variety of formats within the scope<br>
of the present invention, with some complying with magnetic strip standards provided by the<br>
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and/or the International Organization of<br>
Standardization (OSI). In one particular embodiment, first track 452 includes at least some of<br>
the following fields: a start sentinel, a format code, an account number, a first separator, a<br>
surname which may be the customer's name, a second separator, an expiration date, a service<br>
code, a PVKI, a PVV, discretionary data, an end sentinel, and a longitudinal redundancy<br>
check (LRC). A separate field for use by VISA also may be included. Each field has the<br>
appropriate length, which may vary from a single byte (e.g., for the start and end sentinels,<br>
and the separators), to sixteen bytes (e.g., for the account number), up to N number of bytes<br>
(e.g., for the surname field to accommodate names of various lengths). In some<br>
embodiments, second track 454 contains some or all of the same data set as encoded in first<br>
track 452. In other embodiments, first track 452 and/or second track 454 contains an<br>
identifier to indicate to the point-of-sale device or an associated host computer system<br>
whether card 440 has been previously swiped. The identifier may be a single byte, or larger.<br>
 Fig. 5 depicts an alternative embodiment of the present invention. More<br>
specifically, Fig. 5 depicts a transaction card assembly 510 having a card 540 disposed within<br>
a card carrier 520. Card 540 includes an cncodable strip 550. In this embodiment, encodable<br>
strip 550 includes a first uniform product code (UPC) 552 and a second uniform product code<br>
(UPC) 554. In this embodiment, card 540 is read by a point-of-sale device that is adapted to<br>
read UPCs. Again, in one embodiment, a card edge 542 is spaced a distance 570 from a card<br><br>
carner edge 522. In one embodiment, distance 570 corresponds to a gap defined as the<br>
spacing between first and second UPCs 552, 554. The gap may be measured from the lower<br>
edges of UPCs 552, 554 (gap 560) or between upper edges of UPCs 552, 554 (gap 562). In<br>
one embodiment, distance 570, gap 560 and gap 562 are a same distance or length. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, distance 570 corresponds to about 0.130 inches, although alternative<br>
distances fall with the scope of the present invention.<br>
 Fig. 6 depicts a simplified view of a point-of-sale 600 according to the present<br>
invention. In one embodiment, point-of-sale device 600 comprises a housing 610 having a<br>
display screen 620 and input devices 630. Conveniently, input devices 630 may comprise<br>
keys or buttons that may be depressed to enter information into point-of-sale device 600.<br>
Input devices 630 also may be portions of a touch screen. Input devices 630 may each be<br>
associated with one or more letters or other alpha-numeric characters, or may operate as<br>
function keys. Point-of-sale device 600 includes a track or groove 640 through which<br>
transaction card assemblies of the present invention may be slid. In one embodiment, track<br>
640 is adapted to receive a lower edge of transaction card assemblies of the present invention,<br>
or to receive a lower edge of cards 140, 440, 540 separate from the corresponding carriers<br>
120, 420, 520. Point-of-sale device 600 includes one or more read heads adapted to read data<br>
encoded on encodable strips, such as magnetic strips. Some or all of the data read may be<br>
shown on display 620, and may optionally be printed to provide a paper record. It will be<br>
appreciated that the invention is not intended to be limited for use with only a specific type of<br>
point-of-sale device. For example, other point-of-sale devices that may be used to read<br>
transaction cards of the present invention are described in copending U.S. Application No.<br>
10/116,619, filed April 3, 2002, the complete disclosure which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
 A method of using a transaction card assembly according to the present invention<br>
will be described. For this example, the transaction card is a gift card having a monetary<br>
value associated therewith for redemption at a particular merchant. A customer desiring to<br>
purchase the transaction card at the merchant or related location will select the transaction<br>
card assembly and either swipe the transaction card assembly through a point-of-sale device,<br>
or have a store clerk swipe the transaction card assembly through the point-of-sale device.<br>
As described above, at least one encodable track disposed on the card is positioned to be read<br>
by the point-of-sale device even when the card is engaged with the card carrier. The point-<br>
of-sale device reads the encoded data and transmits at least a portion of this data to a<br><br>
processing system that maintains records on transaction cards and their associated accounts.<br>
The system activates an account associated with the card being purchased. In this manner,<br>
the transaction card account associated with the purchased card assembly is activated.<br>
 In this example, the cardholder, who may be the purchaser 01 recipient of the card<br>
(e.g., if the card was a gift), will present the card to a checkout point-of-sale device to<br>
purchase desired items from the merchant. Typically, the purchase occurs sometime<br>
subsequent to the purchase and activation of the card noted above. Further, prior to use of the<br>
card to make a purchase, the card has been removed from the card carrier. The transaction<br>
card is swiped through a point-of-sale device to use the monetary value associated with the<br>
card accound. Aa noted above, the point -of-sale device is adapted to read a different<br>
encodable track on the transaction card when the card is swiped without the carrier attached.<br>
The point-of-sale device creates a debit record that is forwarded to the system maintaining<br>
transaction card accounts, and the card account is debited the appropriate purchase amount.<br>
In the event the attempted purchase exceeds the allotted card value, in some embodiments the<br>
transaction is not authorized and the customer must pay for the entire purchase, or a portion<br>
of the purchase, using some other payment means. It will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art that additional methods of using transaction card assemblies also fall within the scope<br>
of the present invention.<br>
 The invention has now been described in detail. However, it will be appreciated<br>
that the invention may be carried out in ways other than those illustrated in the aforesaid<br>
discussion, and that certain changes and modifications which may be practiced within the<br>
scope of the appended claims. Accordingly, the scope of this invention is not to be limited by<br>
