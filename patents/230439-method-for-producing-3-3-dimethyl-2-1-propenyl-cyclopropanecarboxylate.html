As above, it is possible to reduce the amount of the copper compound and the nitrogen-containing compound until the catalytic amount by using the bidentate nitrogen-containing compound as the nitrogen-containing aromatic compound.<br>
The above-mentioned reaction may be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent.  When the bidentate nitrogen-containing compound is used, it is preferably carried out in the presence of the organic solvent.

The present reaction may be carried out by mixing the pyrethrate ester (1), the copper compound, the nitrogen-containing compound, the solvent and if necessary aluminum oxide, and the mixing order is not limited particularly. For example, after mixing them at once, the resulting mixture may be heated to the reaction temperature, or the pyrethrate ester (1) may be added to the mixture obtained by mixing the copper compound, the nitrogen-containing compound, the solvent and if necessary aluminum oxide and controlled at the reaction temperature.<br>
The reaction temperature is usually the range of about 150°C to 230°C.<br>

conventional analytical means such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, thin layer chromatography, NMR and IR, and the reaction can be finished at the point of confirming the disappearing the pyrethrate ester (1).<br>
After completion of the reaction, for example, the desirable 3,3-dimethyl-2-(1-<br>
propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate can be obtained by, if necessary after filtering the copper compound and aluminum oxide from the reaction mass, distilling off the solvent or concentrating after separating the desirable 3,3-dimethyl-2-(l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate and the nitrogen-containing aromatic compound by adding an aqueous acidic solution and if necessary a water-separable solvent to carry out extracting treatment.<br>
