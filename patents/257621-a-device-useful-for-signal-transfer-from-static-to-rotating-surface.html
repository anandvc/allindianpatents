				<td>A DEVICE USEFUL FOR SIGNAL TRANSFER FROM STATIC SURFACE<br>
TO ROTATING SURFACE AND VICEVERSA<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present innovation relates to a device useful for signal transfer from static surface<br>
to rotating surface and vice-versa. The device can be used in a variety of applications<br>
wherein signal transfer from static surface to rotating surface and vice-versa is<br>
required for example, for exciting rotating piezoelectric crystals mounted on<br>
mechanical rotating scan head, receiving the echoes picked up by rotating crystal and<br>
transferring to static surface with very high efficiency provided the air gap between<br>
the two surfaces is small. This device of the present invention can also be used for<br>
signal isolation in electronic circuits for ground loop minimization etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The early method of signal transfer from static surface to rotating surface was through<br>
the use of carbon brushes, spring loaded contractors, gold slip rings or ball bearings.<br>
These methods however, lost ground with time-because of factional wear, noise<br>
generation etc.<br>
The modem method to achieve the above objective is with a rotating transformer<br>
normally used in videocassette recorders (VCR's). It consists of two wire wound discs<br>
of ferrites. One wire wound disc is connected on the stator (primary) and second wire<br>
wound disc is connected on rotor (secondary) with windings facing each other. The<br>
»<br>
distance between stator and rotor is very small. Signal transfer from static surface to<br>
rotating surface and vice-versa is via these primary/secondary transformer based on<br>
magnetic flux linkage. It depends upon the current induced in the windings, ferrites<br>
used in the set up, turns ratio, air gap between primary and secondary etc.<br>
Some Japanese companies are believed to be making such VCR rotating transformers.<br>
However, a major limitation is that these companies are only interested in supplying<br>
these items in bulk quantities. In addition VCR cores are not available separately and<br>
ferrftes cannot be trimmed by machining. The companies do not provide their<br>
characteristics and other design details etc. The other sources of supply of these items<br>
are generally not known.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for signal<br>
transfer from static surface to rotating surface and vice-versa.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device useful for signal transfer from<br>
static surface to rotating surface and vice-versa with even response throughout 360° rotation of<br>
secondary w.r.t primary wound core.<br>
Yet another object of present innovation is to provide a replacement for the VCR rotating<br>
transformer.<br>

THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device useful for transferring signals from static<br>
surface to a rotating surface, said device characterised by a pair of pot cores (9X5; 9mm OD,<br>
1.5mm ID) acting as a primary and secondary core, said pot cores being wound with 6 to 7 turns<br>
of SWG 36 copper wire such that each turn of copper wire rests on top of the previous turns<br>
thereby increasing in diameter by wire thickness, one of the said pot core is mounted on the<br>
rotating surface and the other pot core is fixed to a static surface with minimum air gap between<br>
each other so that the coils are always facing each other even if the primary and the secondary<br>
cores are rotated through 0 to 360° with respect to each other.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device useful for signal transfer from static surface to<br>
rotating surface &amp; vice-versa which comprises a small transformer with a special pot core<br>
having 'N1' number of turns- at primary and 'N21 number of turns at secondary wound in a<br>
special way on a readily available pot cores with wire wound faces facing each other with<br>
minimum distance with either primary/secondary on a static/rotating surface or vice-versa<br>
resulting in a very efficient device.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the device provides a wide -3dB<br>
bandwidth (100kHz to 10MHz with 9X5 CEL pot core).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the device provides a wide dynamic<br>
range (1-2 u,v toSOOv pulse of 300ns).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, no noise is generated during the<br>
operation of the device, as there is no physical contact between the surfaces. So it has<br>
a very long life.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, a set of Pot cores are wound with<br>
V number of turns wherein each turn rests on top of the previous turns thereby<br>
increasing in diameter by wire thickness with each turn. The number of turns, V<br>
depends upon the inside space of pot core. Increase in the number of turns 'V of<br>
secondary compared to primary increases signal strength by ratio of turns and viceversa.<br>
With equal number of turns on primary &amp; secondary, the signal from primary<br>
goes to secondary with 90% efficiency with small air gap and 180° phase shift w.r.t<br>
primary.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the air space between primary and<br>
secondary, should be as small as possible for maximum efficiency. The minimum air<br>
gap is defined whereby secondary wound core in the device should move freely in<br>
front of primary wound core.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the effect of rotation of such a<br>
device w.r.t each other throughout 360° angle has no effect on the strength of signal<br>
transferred.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in choosing the core of the device. A set of<br>
commonly available pot cores each wound with a particular number of turns of copper<br>
wire constitute the device of the present invention. This set up yields a wide band -3dB<br>
response in ultrasonic range (100KHz to 10MHz with PX5 pot core). The efficiency of<br>
device is around 90% in combined transmit/receive mode. The device has a very wide<br>
dynamic range (from 1-2 uv to 500v pulse) and the response is even throughout 360°<br>
rotation of secondary w.r.t primary wound core.<br>
Accordingly the present innovation provides a device useful for signal transfer from<br>
static surface to rotating surface and vice-versa which comprises a small transformer<br>
with a special core having 'NT number of turns at primary and 'N2' number of turns<br>
of secondary wound in a special way on a readily available pot cores such that the<br>
wire wound faces face each other with minimum distance with either<br>
primary/secondary on a static/rotating surface or vice-versa resulting in a very<br>
efficient device.<br>
The above objective is achieved by using a small pot core (9X5; 9mm OD, 1.5mm ID<br>
as shown in figure 1-G manufactured by M/S CEL, Ghaziabad) as its base material<br>
and keeping 6 turns (N=6) of SWG 36 copper wire each on primary and secondary. If<br>
a bigger pot core is used, the thickness of copper wire has to be increased to<br>
accommodate 6/7 turns each on primary and secondary. The number of turns depends<br>
upon the inside space of pot core and the copper wire is wound in such a way that<br>
each turn rests on top of the previous turns thereby increasing in diameter by wire<br>
thickness. Increase in the number of turns of secondary compared to primary<br>
increases signal strength by ratio of turns and vice-versa.<br>
PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION<br>
When alternating current flows in the circular coil of primary winding, magnetic flux<br>
is generated, the strength of the magnetic flux thus generated depends on magnitude<br>
of current. The direction of the magnetic flux thus generated can be found by applying<br>
Fleming's Right Hand Rule (fig 1-c). The flux strength is enhanced manifolds if the<br>
winding is on a magnetic material such as ferrites. This flux induces an e.m.f. in the<br>
opposite direction in a secondary coil which is 180° out of phase with the primary<br>
(fig. 1-B). Thus, the primary and secondary parts of this device can be connected on<br>
stator / rotor with a little air gap, thus allowing small electrical signals to transfer from<br>
the stator to moving rotor and vice-versa. To keep the voltage gain to unity<br>
approximately, both primary and secondary coils should have the same number of<br>
turns of the coil.<br>
The novelty of the present invention also lies in the fact that the rotation of the<br>
primary and secondary coils with respect to each other through 0° to 360° does not<br>
have any effect on the e.m.f. induced. The Applicants have arrived at this feature by<br>
choosing a core which is circular in shape. As the pot core is circular in shape, the coil<br>
wound on the core is also circular in shape. Thus, the coils are always facing each<br>
other even the primary and the secondary are rotated through 0 to 360° with respect to<br>
each other as shown in fig. 1-F.<br>
Thus, it was observed that the effect of rotary motion of primary or secondary has no<br>
effect on induced e.m.f.<br>
The number of turns depends upon the inside space of pot core and the copper wire is<br>
wound in such a way that each turn rests on top of the previous turns thereby<br>
increasing the inner diameter of the core by a wire thickness each time. This<br>
arrangement results in maximum flux linkage with the secondary winding infront of it<br>
thus resulting in very high efficiency when air gap is small. A readily available pot<br>
core 9X5 from CEL, Ghaziabad constitute the core of such a device. The two sides of<br>
pot core wound with copper wire form primary and secondary of device with wire<br>
wound faces facing each other.<br>
The developed device can be used in a variety of applications such as signal transfer<br>
from static surface to rotating surface and vice-versa e.g. for exciting rotating<br>
piezoelectric crystals mounted on mechanical rotating scan head, receiving the echoes<br>
picked up by rotating crystal and transferring to static surface with very high<br>
efficiency provided the air gap between the two surfaces is small. This device can also<br>
fee used for signal isolation in electronic circuits for ground loop minimization etc.<br>
The present invention is further described with respect to the following examples<br>
which are given by way of illustration and hence, should not be construed to limit the<br>
scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
EXAMPLE -1<br>
The primary of the device is connected to the transmitter and also to the receiving<br>
amplifier. The secondary of the device is connected to a piezoelectric transducer as<br>
shown in figure IB. There is a narrow air gap between the primary and the secondary<br>
of the device. The device is connected in such a way that the coils are facing each<br>
other. The primary is supported in the static probe frame. The secondary is fixed in<br>
the piezoelectric, transducer housing in such a way that axis of transducer passes<br>
through it so that transducer can move freely as shown in Fig IE. This is applicable<br>
for both rotating type ultrasonic transducer and rocking type ultrasonic transducer<br>
probes.<br>
The transmitter generates narrow pulse (50-300nsec) of high voltage (500v). This<br>
pulse excites the primary winding which converts this electrical impulse to magnetic<br>
flux, which induces a proportional current in the secondary winding. This secondary<br>
current impulse excites the piezoelectric transducer which sends mechanical vibration<br>
in the body. The received echoes are picked up by the transducer inducing<br>
proportional current in the secondary, generating flux proportional to echoes which<br>
gets linked to primary winding from where receiving amplifier picks up the signal for<br>
further processing. This way the device helps to transfer signal from static device<br>
to rotating device and back to static device. The efficiency of device is around 90%<br>
compared to direct wire connector circuit. Signal remains pure as brushes or ball<br>
bearing are not used which is normally the method in such cases which generate noise<br>
and also rubbing is avoided resulting in better output and longer life.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
Ground isolation: This can be effectively used to isolate a signal. Sometimes while<br>
working with high frequencies, ground loops are created which degrade the<br>
performance of the circuit. By isolating the ground the problem can be solved at<br>
higher frequencies also which otherwise has very limited options. The signal however<br>
undergoes a 180° phase shift with slight decrease in amplitude.<br>
CHARACTERISTICS<br>
Fig. 2 shows the frequency; response due to this 9 X 5 CEL core. The gain is between<br>
0.86 to 1 from 100 k to 10 MHz. The diagnostic ultrasound range is 1 MHz to 10<br>
MHz. Thus we have been able to get near ideal response in the diagnostic useful<br>
ultrasound range. This flat response can be effectively used to transfer signal from<br>
static surface to rotating surface for a variety of applications in systems working in<br>
ultrasound range of 100 kHz - 10MHz.<br>
Fig. 3 shows the characteristics due to change in air gap, which shows that the least<br>
gap should be preferred for better results. Response from 200 KHz to MHz is shown.<br>
Response to square-wave is shown in fig. 1-D. Due to poor frequency response at<br>
lower frequencies; the waveform looks differentiated.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The main advantages of the present innovation are:<br>
1. A better alternative of rotating transformers.<br>
2. Wide - 3dB bandwidth from 100 KHz to 10 MHz making it ideal even for<br>
wideband multifrequency transducers. Excellent response in ultrasonic<br>
diagnostic range of 1-10 MHz.<br>
3. Wide dynamic range, output of a few micro volts (1-2 uv) to 500 volts pulse<br>
(of 300 nsec pulse width under testing).<br>
4. No noise generating component, pure transmission depending- on magnetic<br>
flux linkage.<br>
5. No wear/tear of parts. No direct contact among surfaces. So very long life.<br>
6. Light Weight, winding/construction is easy.<br>
7. Even response throughout 360° rotation.<br><br><br><br><br>
