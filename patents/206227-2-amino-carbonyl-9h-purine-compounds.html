COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"2-AMINO CARBONYL-9H PURINE COMPOUNDS"<br>
PFIZER INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York 10017, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:                     <br>
                                                                                         GRANTED<br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   2-Amino   carbonyl-9H   purine compound of the formula<br>
This invention relates to purine derivatives. More particularly, this invention relates to 2-aminocarbonyl-9H-purine derivatives and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.<br>
These derivatives are selective, functional agonists of the human adenosine A2a receptor and may be used as anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of, inter alia, diseases of the respiratory tract.<br>
Adenosine is a ubiquitous molecule having a central role in mammalian intermediary metabolism. Independently, adenosine acts on multiple surface receptors to produce a variety of responses. Adenosine receptor classification has revealed the presence of at least four subtypes: A1, A2a, A2b and A3. Stimulation of adenosine A2 receptors on the surface of human neutrophils has been reported to potently inhibit a range of neutrophil functions. Activated neutrophils can damage lung tissue by release of reactive oxygen species, for example, superoxide anion radicals (O2), and granule products, for example, human neutrophil elastase (HNE), amongst other inflammatory mediators. In addition, activated neutrophils perform both de novo synthesisand release of arachidonate products such as leukotriene B4 (LTB4). l_TB4is a potent chemo-attractant that recruits additional neutrophils to the inflammatory focus, whereas released 02"and HNE adversely affect the pulmonary extracellular matrix. The A2 receptor subtype mediating many of these responses (O2 and LTB4/HNE release and cell adhesion) is established as A2a. The A2 subtype (A2a or A2b) mediating the other effects remains to be established.<br>
Selective agonist activity at the A2a receptor is considered to offer greater therapeutic benefit than the use of non-selective adenosine receptor agonists because interaction with other subtypes is associated with detrimental effects in the lung in animal models and human tissue studies. For example, asthmatics, but not non-asthmatics, bronchoconstrict when challenged with inhaled adenosine. This response is at least in part due to the activation of the<br><br>
A1 receptor subtype. Activation of A1 receptors also promotes neutrophil chemotaxis and adherence to endothelial cells, thus promoting lung injury. Furthermore, many patients with respiratory disease will be co-prescribed py agonists, and negative interaction has been shown in animal studies between isoprenaline and adenosine receptors negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. Degranulation of human mast cells is promoted by activation of adenosine A2b receptors, thus selectivity over the A2b receptor is also advantageous.<br>
We have now surprisingly found the present purine derivatives inhibit neutrophil function and are selective agonists of the adenosine A2a receptor. They may also have antagonist activity at the adenosine A3 receptor. The present compounds may be used to treat any disease for which an adenosine A2a receptor agonist is indicated. They can be used to treat a disease where leukocyte (e.g. neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, lymphocyte, macrophage) -induced tissue damage is implicated. They are useful as anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of diseases of the respiratory tract such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, emphysema, bronchiectasis, chronic sinusitis and rhinitis. The present compounds may also be used in the treatment of septic shock, male erectile dysfunction, male factor infertility, female factor infertility, hypertension, stroke, epilepsy, cerebral ischaemia, peripheral vascular disease, post-ischaemic reperfusion injury, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, eczema, ulcerative colitis, Crohns disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Heliobacter pylori gastritis, non-Hellobacter pylori gastritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced damage to the gastro-intestinal tract or a psychotic disorder, or for wound healing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Thus tablets or capsules of the compound of the formula (I) may contain from 0.01 to 500 mg of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be administered intranasal^ or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist) or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark]) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide, a further perfluorinated hydrocarbon such as Perflubron (trade mark) or other<br><br><br>
WO 01/94368	PCTYIB01/00973<br>
suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol (optionally, aqueous ethanol) or a suitable agent for dispersing, soiubilising or extending release and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules, blisters and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the formula (I), a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as I-leucine, mannitol or magnesium stearate.<br>
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1jng to 10mg of a compound of the formula (I) or a salt thereof and the actuation volume may vary from 1 to 1 OOJLII. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of the formula (I) or salt thereof, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride.<br>
Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff contains from 1 to 4000 Μg  of a compound of the formula (I) for delivery to the patient.

The compounds of the formula (I) may also be used in combination with a cycfodextrin. Cycfodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-incfusfon complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91 /11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
