				<td>The present invention relates to novel process for the production of amides from amines using carboxylic acids as the acylating agents and natural/modified montmorillonite clays as catalysts.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an ecofriendly process for the production of amides from aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic, acyclic and heterocyclic amines having carbon atoms in the range of C1 to C20 using carboxylic acids as the acylating agents and montmorillonite clays as catalysts and dispensing with the use of expensive corresponding anhydride as a reagent and corrosive, toxic sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acids as catalysts. This process totally eliminates the disposal of salts formed consequent to the neutralisation of H2SO4 or sulfonic acids and the use of expensive anhydrides.<br>
These amides belong to a very important class of chemicals having applications as intermediates for pharmaceuticals, azo and sulfur dyes, fine chemicals, drugs, as stabilizers for hydrogen peroxide, as photographic chemicals and as antioxidants. N-acetyl p-amino phenol (APAP), commonly known as acetaminophen or paracetamol, is known for a wide variety of uses. Its medicinal use is very well known, notably as a non-prescription analgesic and anti-pyretic agent with properties similar to aspirin. It is also a major component in over 200 other drug formulations.<br>
Amide formation is generally performed with acyl chlorides or anhydrides in presence of bases, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-pyrrolidinopyridine, trimethylamine etc. Lewis acids such as zinc chloride, cobalt chloride, scandium trifluoromethanesulphonate which are good in the acetylation of amines with acetic anhydride generates one molecule of carboxylic acid for every molecule of anhydride consumed and therefore renders the process very expensive. To optimise the yields of ester/amide formation 2-15 molar equivalents of condensing agents such as sulfuric acid, tosylchloride, trifluoroacetic anhydride, polyphosphate ester, N, N -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, graphite etc., are generally employed. Heterogeneous acidic and superacid catalysts have proved to be useful in some reactions because of their activity, selectivity, reusability, non-corrosivity and virtual absence of effluent treatment which usually is associated with the homogeneous catalysts.<br>
US Patent 2.462,221 Feb 22, 1949 describes a process wherein acetanilide is prepared by heating aniline with 20% excess of acetic acid in the presence of 2-5% by wt of benzene. The reaction mixture was heated in the range of 13O~2O0°C. Toluidine is acetylated in similar way to get very good yields. US Patent 2,551,047 May 1, 1951 describes a process wherein N-aryl acetamides are prepared by heating an arylamine with up to 25% excess of acetic acid in presence of up to 5% of AcOR, which acts as entrainer of water. The reaction temperatures are in the range of 130-200°C and the reaction time is 21hrs for acetanilide preparation. The drawbacks in the above-described processes are that reactions are of quite long duration and the reaction temperatures used are very high. US Patent 4,288,592 September 8, 1981 describes a process wherein the amides are prepared by reacting amines with acid halides or anhydrides in an inert organic diluent, in the presence of molecular sieves. The drawbacks in the above-described processes are that acid halides or anhydrides are used as acylating agents and all the reactions are performed in nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
A communication in J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun., 1987,114 discloses the acetylation of amines in presence of acetic anhydride as the acetylating agent and cobalt(II) chloride as catalyst. The drawbacks in the above process are in the use of expensive acetic anhydride.<br>
A communication in J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun., 1997,1389, discloses the use of montmorillonite K-10 and KSF catalysts for the acetylation of primary and secondary amines in presence of acetic anhydride the acetylating agent and finds that the results are remarkable. The drawbacks in the above process are the use of an expensive acetic anhydride as acetylating agent. Also, the reactions are not selective i. e., both the functional groups are acetylated in the case of 2-aminophenol, depending upon the molar ratios of the substrate and the acetic anhydride used. Moderate yields are obtained in this process.<br>
In almost all the US patents 4,264,526; 4,264,525; 4,565,890; 3,076,030; 3,341,587 and 5,155,269, the acetylation of p-amino phenol was performed in presence of acetic anhydride/acetic anhydride in aqueous solvent system. US Patent 4,264,526, April 28, 1981 describes a process for the production of aminophenols and N-acetyl p-aminophenol (APAP) comprising alkaline hydrolysis of halonitrobenzene to nitrophenol and from nitrophenols to aminophenols using a borate ion additive during hydrogenation. to eliminate undesirable byproducts and colour formation. CS Patent 223,945 (CI. C07C 91/44) 15 Nov 1985 discloses a process wherein the acetylation of aminophenols with acetic anhydride in ethyl acetate or AcOH gives moderate yields of acetaminophen. The drawbacks in the above processes are the use of acetic anhydride as acetylating agent and the yields are moderate.<br>
US Patent 4,670,589, June 2,1987 describes a process for the production of APAP by hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol to p-amino phenol (PAP), and concurrently acetylating the PAP with acetic anhydride. US Patent 5,648,535, July 15,1997, describes a process for the production of N-acylaminophenols by the concurrent hydrogenation of a nitrophenol to an aminophenol and the acylation of the aminophenol with acyl anhydride on a continuous basis in a stirred tank reactor. The drawbacks in the above processes are the use of excess acetic anhydride as acetylating agent / solvent system, difficulty of mono-acetylating the amino group, longer reaction times, oligomerization of the hydroxyl aromatic amine, and color body formation.<br>
Obviously  different  approaches  have  been  employed  both   on  laboratory  and commercial scale to prepare the industrially useful amides, and the traditional homogeneous catalysed reactions are being less favoured owing to the problems of separation and reuse. The present trend is to develop solid acids from cheaply available sources, and especially of clays.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel process for the production of amides from amines, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a process wherein the use of expensive reactants such as anhydrides is obviated.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for the production of amides from amines wherein the formation of excessive effluents is avoided.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is the usage of non-corrosive and cheaply available heterogeneous solid acid catalysts for the first time for easy adaptability in a continuous process.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of amides from amines wherein at least some of the reactants can be recovered by distillation and reused.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for the formation of amides from amines wherein maximum yields of amides are obtained.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide the process wherein a wider range of amines as starting material can be utilised.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the production of amides from amines wherein the reaction takes place at lower temperatures.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to accomplish the process in short time and in inexpensive manner.<br>
These and the other objects of the present invention are achieved by the process of the present invention for the production of amides from amines using a carboxylic acid selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, propionic acid , butyric acid etc as acylating agent and natural/ modified montmorillonite clays as catalysts.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of amide which comprises reacting an amine having 1-20 carbon atoms and selected from the group comprising aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic and hetero cyclic amines with an acylating agent comprising a carboxylic acid of the kind such as herein described in a molar ratio of 1:3 to 1:10 in the presence of reusable natural montmorillonite / metal ion exchanged clay catalyst in a aromatic hydrocarbon solvent medium at a temperature in the range of 30-160° C for a period of 0.02 to 6 hours and recovering the corresponding amides by separating the catalyst through filtration and removing the solvent by rotavapour /distillation.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention clay catalyst used is metal ion exchanged montmorillonite selected from the group comprising of Fe3+, Co2+, Cu2+ Zn2+, A13+, Ce3+, La 3+orZr4+ montmorillonites.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the said amines are selected from the group comprising p- amino phenol; o- amino phenol; p- nitro aniline; m- nitro aniline; p- chloro aniline; aniline; benzyl amine; phenyl ethyl amine; p-anisidine; (D) (+) methyl benzyl amine; 4~ bromo-2-methylaniiine; 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene; 2-(2-aminoethyl) pyridine; furfurylamine; 2;methyl 2-amino-l, 3-propanediol; dodecylamine; propargylamine; cyclohexylamine and 1 napthylamine.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the acylating agent used is selected from the group comprising of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in an amount in the range of 3-10 m moles of substrate.<br>
In the present invention, abundantly available montmorillonite sourced from nature is used as the solid acid catalyst for the acylation of various amines with acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid etc., as acylating agents without any further purification (example 1b) for the first time. The activity of the natural montmorillonite is comparable with metal ion, exchanged K10 montmorillonite clay catalysts (with slight change in activity / reaction time) in the selective acylation of amines. While K10 montmorillonite as supplied from Fluka will lead to many side products such as di-acetylation and oligomerization or polymerised products, and alkylation on the aromatic solvents used in the reaction. These results indicate that right admix of Bronsted and Lewis acidities is an essential requirement to trigger catalytic acylations of amines with carboxylic acid to afford optimum yields. Natural montmorillonite sourced from nature has Lewis .acid sites, resulted from the transition metal sites exchanged on montmorillonite and Bronsted acid sites. In the acid treated montmorillonite, K10, the density of the Bronsted acidic sites-increases because of increased number of broken edges resulted from broken layers, while the Lewis acidity decreases due-to desorption of exchanged metal ion on montmorillonite inherently present in natural montmorillonite during acid treatment. K10 montmorillonite with very high Bronsted acidity thus induces the side product formation as exemplified above. Introduction of metal through ion exchange process to montmorillonrte K10 increases the Lewis acidity and simultaneously decreases Bronsted acidity to form right admix of Bronsted and Lewis acid sites to effect acylation of amines selectively.<br>
The  present invention will  now be described  in  greater detail  with reference to following illustrative but non-limitative examples.<br>
All the metal ion-exchanged montmorillonite clay catalysts were prepared as described in example 1 and employed in the N-acylation of amines with carboxylic acids as acyiating agents as described in examples 2 to 37.<br>

ions from the discarded water. The clay was dried overnight in an oven at 120°C and finely<br>
ground in a mortar.<br>
