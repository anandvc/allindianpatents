The 4-aminopyrimidines used in accordance with the invention are prepared by methods known perse (J. Org. Chem.; 1967, 32,1591).

The crude product is concentrated by evaporation and taken up in 30 ml of toluene.<br>
4.31 g of phosphorus oxychloride (28.1 mmol) are added and the reaction mixture is heated<br>
at 120°C for 3 hours. After cooling to 20°C, the excess is neutralised with sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, and the mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate and then washed with water and<br>
saturated sodium chloride solution.<br>
The product solution is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated by evaporation.<br>

Example 2: Reaction of 4-chloro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyrimidine with monoamines 20.5 mg of 4-chloro-6-methyl-2-phenylpyrimidine (0.1 mmol) are heated with 3 equivalents of monoamines (0.3 mmol) in 0.5 ml of absolute dioxane at 100°C for 20 hours. After cooling, the products are concentrated in vacuo, taken up in t-BuOH/water 4/1 and freeze-dried. The end products are analysed by LC-MS.<br>
Example 3: Loading of tritvl chloride polystyrene resin with N.N-bisC3-aminopropy0rnethyl-amines and reaction with 4.6-dichloro-2.5-diphenylpyrimidine<br>

bis(3-aminopropyl)methylamine (0.645 mmol) at 25°C for 3 hours. The resin is filtered off<br>
and washed with DCM, MeOH, THF, MeOH and DCM and dried in vacuo.<br>
The resin is shaken in 1 ml of DMF with 0.194 g of 4,6-dichloro-2,5-diphenylpyrimidine<br>
(0.645 mmol) and 90 fxl of triethylamine (0.645 mmol) at 25°C for 3 hours.<br>

heated at 90°C for 1 hour.<br>
After cooling, the resin is filtered off and washed with DMF, MeOH, THF, MeOH and DCM<br>
and dried in vacuo.<br>
The products are split off using 1.5 ml of a 5 % TFA/DCM solution at room temperature for<br>
3 hours. The resin is then washed with 1 ml of DCM and 1 ml of MeOH, and the combined<br>
solutions are concentrated to dryness by evaporation. The end products are analysed by<br>
LC-MS.<br>

Example 10: Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC value) in microtitre plates<br>
Nutrient medium:<br>
Casein/soymeal peptone broth for preparation of pre-cultures of test bacteria and yeast.<br>
Examples of test organisms:<br>
Bacteria:	Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP A-22 (=PA)<br>
Escherichia coli NCTC 8196 (= EC)<br>
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144 (= SA)<br>
Candida albicans ATCC 10231 (= CA)<br><br>
Procedure:<br>
The test substances are pre-dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested in a dilution series of 1:2.<br>
Bacteria and yeast are cultured overnight in CASO broth.<br>
All the test organism suspensions are adjusted to an organism count of 1 - 5 x 106 CFU/ml using 0.85 % sodium chloride solution.<br>
The test substances are pre-pipetted into microtitre plates in amounts of 8 u.l per well.<br>
The pre-adjusted organism suspensions are diluted 1:100 in CASO broth and are added in amounts of 192 jitl per well to the test substances.<br>
The test batches are incubated for 48 hours at 37°C.<br>
After incubation, the growth is determined on the basis of the turbidity of the test batches (optical density) at 620 nm in a microplate reader.<br>
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC value) is the concentration of substance at which (compared to the growth of the control) an appreciable inhibition of growth (
Three microtitre plates are used for each test organism and substance concentration. All the substances are tested in duplicate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 11: Agar incorporation test CGI 28e<br>
Medium:	Casein/soymeal peptone agar (Merck)<br>
*Sabouraud 4 % glucose agar (Merck)<br>
Diluent:	Sterile 0.85 % NaCI solution<br>
Incubation:	24 hours at 37°C<br>
*3 days at 28°C<br>
Test solution:	1 % stock solutions of all the test substances are prepared in a suitable<br>
solvent and diluted in serial dilutions to end concentrations of from lOOOppm to lOppm.<br>
Test principle:<br>
0.3 ml of each dilution step is mixed with 15 ml of nutrient medium while the latter is still liquid. After the nutrient medium has solidified, 10 ul of each of the following organism dilutions of the test strains in 0.85 % NaCI solution are spotted onto the agar medium:<br><br>
The plates are incubated at 37°C for 24 hours (A. niger at 28°C for 3 days) and then the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of the test substance at which growth is just no longer discernible (corresponds to the MIC) is determined. The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Example 12: "Microbicidal activity" suspension testCG 161/EN1040<br>
Test method:<br>
Nutrient medium:<br>
Casein/soymeal peptone broth for preparation of pre-cultures of test bacteria<br>
Examples of test organisms:<br>
Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 Actynomyces viscosus ATCC 43146<br><br>
Procedure:<br>
The test substances are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested in a<br>
concentration of 120 ug/ml.<br>
Bacteria are incubated overnight in CASO broth and adjusted to an organism count of<br>
1 - 5 x 10s CFU/ml using 0.85 % sodium chloride solution.<br>
The test substances are pre-pipetted into microtitre plates in amounts of 8 u,l per well.<br>
The adjusted test organism suspensions are added in amounts of 192 u.l per well to the test substances and mixed. After defined contact times, the test batches are mixed, an aliquot is withdrawn and diluted in several steps in a dilution series of 1:10 in a suitable inactivation medium.<br>
The test plates are incubated for 24 hours at 37CC. After incubation, the growth is determined on the basis of the turbidity of the test batches (optical density) at 620 nm in a microplate reader.<br>
On the basis of the number of steps in the dilution series that exhibit growth, the reduction in the test organism concentration is determined in powers of ten (log value).<br>
One microtitre plate is used for each test organism.<br>
All the substances are tested in duplicate.<br>
The results (log reduction) are shown in Table 4:<br><br><br><br>
