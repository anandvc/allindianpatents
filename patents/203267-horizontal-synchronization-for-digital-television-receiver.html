				<td>HORIZONTAL SYNCHRONIZATION FOR DIGITAL TELEVISION RECEIVER<br>
Background of the Invention<br><br>
This invention relates to the field of a horizontal synchronizing system for digital television receiver.<br><br>
Analog video signals have a horizontal synchronizing and scanning frequency of approximately 15.735 KHz in the NTSC system.  This synchronizing and scanning frequency is different in the PAL and SECAM systems, but is generally comparable.  Irrespective of the system, this is generally referred to as a standard horizontal synchronizing and scanning frequency, often denoted as Â£H or 1fH.  Television receivers providing progressive scanning rather than interlaced scanning operate at twice the standard synchronizing frequency, approximately 31.47 KHz in NTSC, often denoted as 2fH.  Such television receivers upconvert the analog video input using digital circuits that double the number of horizontal lines per field, either by repeating each line or by interpolation.  A phase detector is utilized to synchronize the 2fH deflection circuit with the 1fH input video signal.<br>
Digital television receivers, for example those designed to process video signals in the MPEG2 format, can have horizontal synchronization circuits operating at 2.14fH, approximately 33.75 KHz.  The circuits for processing an MPEG2 signal include a time base correction function that obviates the need for a phase detector.  Instead, a binary rate multiplier responsive to a microprocessor controls an oscillator, which in turn drives a number of counters that divide the oscillator output down to the desired horizontal drive frequency.  The upconverted video data is written into and read from a memory in such a way that time base correction is provided.<br>
It was thought that in a digital television receiver operating at 2.14fH, standard 1fH video could simply be<br>
-1-<br><br>
upconverted to 2.14fH instead of 2fH; and indeed, the upconversion presented no special difficulties.  However, a number of unanticipated problems were encountered when displaying the upconverted video at 2.14fH.  One of the problems encountered stemmed from the coupling of the deflection voltages and currents into the lfH NTSC signal paths into the television receiver, for example from the antenna, from a video cassette recorder and from a DVD player. This is similar to signal pickup or coupling that can happen internally to the television receiver, for example by ground loops on circuit boards.  The third wire ground of the television receiver or of the externally connected components can also contribute to this signal pickup.  Under this condition the 2.14H deflection currents and/or voltages are asynchronous with respect to the input NTSC signal being displayed and the coupled signal appears in the scanned raster as an interference similar to horizontal bars.<br>
It was found that this effect can be reduced by operating the deflection circuit at 2fH instead of 2.14fH.  Under this condition the coupled interference is reduced in visibility but is still present and can be seen in the raster as vertical bars moving horizontally, similar to horizontal shading except that the moving bars are not locked to scan.  The unwanted coupled signal is moving because the upconversion process does not maintain the horizontal phase relationship of the display section output to the incoming NTSC signal.  While the upconverted NTSC is close in frequency to the 2fH scanned raster these signals are not at the identical frequency and they are not synchronized in phase.<br>
Accordingly, a solution was needed that would enable a digital television receiver to display digital video signals, for example in MPEG2 format, at 2.14fH and to display standard video signals, for example NTSC, in an upconverted, progressively scanned format.<br>
-2-<br><br>
The visibility of the interference due to upconverted scanning even at 2fH, instead of 2.14fH, can be further reduced by phase/frequency locking the 2fH deflection to the incoming lfH signal.  This reduces any deflection generated coupled signal to stationary interference on the raster display.  In accordance with this solution the lfH synchronizing/drive signal obtained from the lfH video input signal is compared to the 2fH deflection drive pulse in a phase detector.  The output of the phase detector is then used to control the frequency of a voltage controlled oscillator.  The display pixel clock for the MPEG2 video signal is derived from the VCO, and accordingly, controlling its frequency permits closing the phase locked loop to bring the 2fH deflection in phase/frequency lock with the lfH NTSC input horizontal synchronizing component.<br>
However, this solution posed a further problem of needing to operate the television receiver at two different horizontal scanning frequencies for different kinds of video input signals, for example digital video signals in MPEG2 format at 2.14fH and analog video signals in NTSC, PAL or SECAM format at 2fH.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments A block diagram of a multiple frequency horizontal synchronizing system 10 in accordance with the inventive arrangements is shown in Figure 1.  The system has selectable<br>
modes of operation including an open loop and a closed loop<br>
-5-<br><br>
control path for an oscillator 20.  Oscillator 20 can, for example, be a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) or a voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO).  Open loop control is used for displaying digital video signals, for example in MPEG2 format.  The oscillator 20 operates at 13.5 MHz, which is then doubled to 27 MHz and used as the reference for an 81 MHz pixel display clock and the MPEG2 system clock.<br>
The open loop control path begins with a microprocessor ( P) 26 that supplies a digital frequency control value to a binary rate multiplier (BRM) over a data bus 40.  The digital frequency control value is converted to an MPEG2 system clock control voltage by a BRM filter 24.  The output of BRM filter 24 on line 25 is a first input to a filter source switch 18. The MPEG2 system clock control voltage is supplied to the oscillator 20 from filter source switch 18 responsive to a 2fH / 2.14fH selection signal generated by the microprocessor 27. The BRM filter input represents the control signal used for 2.14fH deflection.  The selection signal is illustrated as a direct wire connection, but selection control can also be implemented by the data bus 40 or by a serial data and control bus of the kind having SDA and SCL signals, not shown.<br>
A clock generation and counters circuit 28 is responsive to the output of the oscillator 20.  A raster generator is responsive to the clock generation and counters circuit 30, and in turn, drives a display circuit 36.  The display circuit generates a 2.14fH drive signal.  In the presently preferred embodiment, circuits 28, 30 and 36 are embodied in an Sti7000 integrated circuit available from ST Microelectronics.<br>
The closed loop path includes a phase detector 14.  A standard 1fH analog video signal, for example NTSC, PAL or SECAM, is an input to a digitizer and synchronizing signal separator 12,  A 1fH synchronizing signal is a first input to the phase detector 14.  The drive signal generated by the display circuit 3 6 is fed back as a second input to the phase<br><br>
detector 14.  The feedback path includes a branch point 42 that illustrates three different embodiments.  In one embodiment path 44 leads directly to the phase detector without any modification of the drive signal.  In this case, the phase detector compares the phase of every 1fH synchronizing pulse with every other pulse of the drive signal.  In the case of a 1fH input video signal, the drive signal will have a frequency of 2fH.  In a second embodiment represented by pulse width stretch circuit 46, the drive pulses are stretched, for example from a width of<br>
approximately 1  sec to approximately 9  sec.  In a third embodiment represented by divider circuit 48, the drive signal is divided by two.  The embodiments represented by circuits 46 and 48 enable the resulting phase locked loop to operate with a faster response time than when direct path 44 is utilized.<br>
The output of the phase detector is integrated by a phase detector filter 16.  The integrated output is a phase lock control voltage supplied as a second input to filter source switch 18 over line 17.  The phase detector filter input represents the control signal used for 2fH deflection.<br>
The analog video that has been processed by digitizer 12 is supplied on lines 15 to a 1fH to 2FH upconversion circuit 32.  The upconversion can be accomplished by doubling the number of horizontal lines, as the digitized video is read out from a memory 34.  Alternatively, the upconversion can be accomplished by interpolation.  The upconverted video signal is read from the memory 34 into the display circuit 36, and then supplied as a video output signal (VIDEO OUT).  The upconversion circuit 32 can also be a part of the Sti7000 integrated circuit.<br>
During operation at 2.14fH there will be a 2.14Â£H input to the phase detector 14, and there may be a 1fH synchronizing signal also applied to the phase detector 14 even if the 1fH<br>
signal is not selected for display.  However, the filter<br>
-1-<br><br>
source switch will at that time be supplying the MPEG2 system clock control voltage to the oscillator and the output of the phase detector 16, if any, will be effectively ignored.<br>
When the system supplies the 2fH drive signal instead of the 2.14fH drive signal the oscillator operates at the same clock frequency.  Instead of changing the oscillator frequency, the operation of the clock generation and counters circuit 28 is modified to change the number of samples during blanking.  The significant difference is that the 2fH drive signal and the lfH input signal are phase locked, thus eliminating, or at least substantially eliminating the noise problem resulting from unlocked operation.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a first set of embodiments for implementing various parts of the system 10 shown in Figure 1. Pulse width stretching circuit 46 can be embodied as a CD4098 integrated circuit U2, a CMOS dual one-shot.  The one-shot utilizes an external timing circuit formed by capacitor C3 and resistors R2 and R3 to stretch the 2fH drive pulse from a 1  sec duration to a 9  sec duration.<br>
The phase detector 14 can be implemented by a MC1391 integrated circuit U3, a television horizontal processor including a phase detector.  The output of the one-shot U2 is filtered by resistors R4 and R5 and capacitor C4 and then applied to pin 4 of U3.  The lfH horizontal synchronizing signal is filtered by resistor Rl and capacitor Cl and applied to pin 3 of U3 .  The output of the phase detector is applied to a phase detector filter 16, which is embodied as an integrator formed by capacitors C5 and C6 and resistor R6. The voltage on the output of the integrator is then fed to a TL082 operational-amplifier U4, where the voltage is scaled to match the range to the VCO / VCXO 20.  The filter source switch 18 can be embodied as CD4053B analog multiplexer integrated circuit U5.  One input contact of a switch A is<br>
coupled to the output of the op-amp U4 on pin 13.  The other<br>
-8-<br><br>
input contact of switch A is coupled to the BRM filter 24, through resistor R22, on pin 13 of U5.  A switch embodied by transistor Ql controls the voltage on pin 11 of U5 responsive to the 2fH / 2.14fH control signal, thus controlling the operation of switch A.  Switch A selects either the BRM filter or the phase detector filter as the control source for the oscillator 20, for operation at 2.14fH and 2fH respectively.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second set of embodiments for implementing various parts of the system 10 shown in Figure 1. The embodiment of Figure 3 is particularly useful for a VCXO oscillator, which uses varactors to control frequency.  This embodiment advantageously combines the phase detector and scaler of Figure 2, thus reducing the number of components, by having the output of the phase detector directly generate the range of 0 to 15 volts required for the VCXO varactors. In this approach the phase detector 14 is embodied in a CD4053B analog multiplexer U6, in which switch A is switched between +15 volts on pin 13 and ground on pin 12 at a 2fH rate based on the deflection.  The pulse width stretch circuit 46 in Figure 3 is embodied by a component one-shot circuit formed by transistors Q2 and Q3.  The values of resistors R10, Rll, R12, R13 and R14 are chosen to provide an approximately 9  sec output pulse responsive to an approximately 1 flsec input pulse, as in Figure 2.  It will be appreciated that the embodiments of the pulse width stretch circuit 46 shown in Figures 2 and 3 are interchangeable.  The 2fH rate control for switch A is the width-extended 2fH drive pulse applied to pin<br>
11.<br>
Switch B is controlled by transistor Q4 responsive to the lfH synchronizing component.  The output of switch B is coupled from pin 1 to the phase detector filter 16, embodied by capacitors C16 and C17 and resistor R18.  The integrated voltage is coupled to one input of switch C on pin 3.  The BRM<br>
-9-<br><br>
filter output is coupled to the other input of switch C on pin 5.  Switch C switches the voltage applied to the VCXO varactors between the phase detector output for lfH video signal upconversion operation and the BRM output used in normal MPEG2 decoding.  In this approach the magnitudes of the phase detector filter charge and discharge currents are primarily determined by the value of resistor R17, presently 20K.  In the locked condition the average value of the charge and discharge currents are equal.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the voltage at pin 15, the voltage at pin 10 and the current at through resistor R17, which is also the current at pin 1.  It can be seen that the lfH signal on pin 10 samples every other pulse of the 2fH signal on pin 15, thus causing the positive and negative currents at resistor Rl7/pin 1.  More particularly, when the pulses of the lfH signal occur, the integrator is charged or discharged. When the lfH pulses do not occur, the input to the integrator floats.  The integrated current at pin 3 need not be scaled to drive the varactors of a VCXO.<br>
