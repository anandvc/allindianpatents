				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of cyanopyridines. This invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of nitriles such as 3-cyanopyridine and 4-cyanopyridine from 3-picoline and 4-picoline respectively. According to the process of the present invention 3- and 4- picolines are reacted with ammonia and air in the presence of a catalyst selected from crystalline, porous vanadium aluminophosphates(VAPO). The process of preparing the above catalyst has been described and claimed in our copending application number 1459/Del/95.<br>
In the presently known process, 3- and 4- cyanopyridines can be synthesized from ammoxidation of 3- and<br>
4-picolines  over  amorphous V 0  or   VOPO   supported<br>
2 5	4<br>
over various supports like Al 0 , Al 0 ,Cr 0 ,TiO .<br>
2 3    2 3   2 3    2<br>
The conventional catalysts have been amorphous in nature and not shape selective catalysts. These catalysts have been employed in mostly fixed bed reactors. The following patents have discussed the preparation of nitriles of present interest, e.g. Eur.Pat; Appl. EP 37173 (1981), US Patent 4876348 (1989),US Patent 4603 207  (1986), Eur. Pat 0037123A1 (1981),  Brit.   Patent<br>
77746 (1957), Ger.  (East)  DDPatent 241903 (1985),  US<br>
Patent  3981879  (1976), US Patent 2839535  (1958),  US<br>
Patent  2510605 (1950) , US Patent 3981879  (1976) .   In<br>
these inventions the yield of nitrile may or may not be<br>
highly selective.  Particularly high-boiling  products,<br>
CO,CO  were formed, due to the amorphous nature of  the 2<br>
catalysts.  The high-boling products create environmental and disposal problems.<br>
The  reaction  of  3-picoline  or  4-picoline  was<br>
carried    out   over   V O -Al O ,mixed   oxides    of<br>
2 5   2 3<br>
V,Cr,Ti,Sb,Al or Si.The yield of 3-cyanopyridine varied<br>
from 50 to 85%; while the yield of 4-cyanopyridine  was<br>
70  to  90%.The other products were  the  high  boiling<br>
compounds,CO and CO .<br>
2<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of cyanopyri-dines employing porous active catalytic materials. The other objective of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of nitriles wherein the formation  of  CO, CO  and high-boiling products  are  mini-<br>
2<br>
mized.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process<br>
for  the preparation of cyanopyridines from  respective<br>
picolines  in 50-85% yields of by ammoxidation  in  one<br>
step  with  very  high  selectivity  over   VAPO(TPA-B)<br>
o catalysts at a temperature in the range of 350 to  450<br>
C and weight hourly space velocity in the range of 0.2 5<br>
to  1.0  per hour.<br>
Accordingly,  the  present invention  provides  an<br>
improved process for the preparation of  cyanopyridines<br>
from  respective picolines which comprises ; passing  a<br>
feed consisting of respective picolines, ammonia, water<br>
and air/ oxygen over a  crystalline , vanadium - alumi-<br>
no  phosphate (VAPO) catalyst prepared by  the  process<br>
described  &amp; claimed in our copending application   no.<br>
1459/del/95 at a temperature in the range of 300 -  450 o C,  and  weight hourly space velocity of  liquid  feed<br>
products in the range of 0.25 to 1.0 per hr and  recovering the cyanopyridine formed by known methods.<br>
The  molar ratio of  picolines and ammonia may  be in the range of 1:1 to 1:20.<br>
The feed ratio of air / oxygen gas may be in   the range of 3 0 - 100 cc. per minute.<br>
The  catalysts are prepared in general in the  fol<br>
lowing way. Al (SO ) , H PO , with or without NaCl,V 0<br>
2   4 3   3  4	2 5<br>
and tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPA) or tetrabutylam-monium bromide (TBA) used as a template,are mixed in distilled water in the pH range of 7.0 to 12.0. The slurry is mixed for atleast 2 hrs at room temperature with constant stirring and the pH is adjusted by aqueous ammonia.  The slurry was put into an autoclave  for<br>
autoclaving under autogeneous pressure in the  tempera-<br>
o ture range of 150 to 220  C for 24  hrs to 80 hrs  till<br>
complete crystallization was achieved.  The mixture was<br>
filtered  and  washed with  distilled  water.The  solid<br>
o catalyst  was dried in oven at 120  C over  night.  The<br>
organic template was removed by  the activation of  the<br>
o catalyst at 400-550  C for 5-15 hrs. Then the  calcined<br>
material was modified by promoters like Sb O  or oxides<br>
2 3<br>
of the elements active as promoters in the respective reactions. Basically in aluminophosphate molecular sieves the Al:P atomic ratio is 1:1. We have substituted P partially by V as discussed and claimed in the copending patent number : 1459/del/95. Al also may be substituted partially by V ; with the corresponding variation in the atomic ratio.<br>
The above said reactions were carried out in a tubular,down-flow, pyrex reactor with 20 mm internal diameter. The reaction mixture was fed from top using syringe pump(Sage Instruments,USA). The product was cooled by using ice-cooled water and collected at the bottom. The required number of ice-cooled traps were used to collect the total amount of products. The products were analysed by using SE-30 (5%) and OV-17 columns.The analysis was confirmed by mass spectra and GC-mass.<br>
The  ammoxidation  of 4-picoline with  ammonia  was<br>
o carried out in presence of air (O ) at 420  C with  0.5<br>
2 -1 hr    W.H.S.V.  and  4 gm  of  catalyst  like  VAPO(B),<br>
VAPO(C),VAPO(D)   (18-30 mesh).  4-Picoline was  diluted<br>
with  water  in  1:3 volume ratio.  The  feed  rate  of<br>
ammonia was 30-35 cc per min and the rate of air was 6 0<br>
cc  per  min.  The following reaction  parameters  were<br>
varied,reaction temperature, 4-picoline : NH ,  4-pico-<br>
3<br>
line:H O, W.H.S.V., etc. 2<br>
The  ammoxidation of 3-picoline with  ammonia  was<br>
o carried  out  in presence of air (O ) at  420   C  with<br>
2 -1 0.5hr    W.H.S.V. and 4gm of catalyst.  3-Picoline  was<br>
diluted with water using 1:3 by volume ratio. The feed rate of ammonia gas was 3 5 cc per min and rate of air was 60 cc per min. With the increase of ammonia in the feed there was increase in the yield of 3-cyanopyridine to about 60.8 wt%. The various reaction parameters like reaction temperature, weight hourly space velocity, picoline to ammonia and water ratio in the feed were varied.<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the process of the present invention,however these should not be construed to limit the scope of invention.<br>
EXAMPLE - 1<br>
0.477 gm per hr 4-Picoline, 1.50 gm of water  per<br>
hour,0.228 gm( 3 0 cc per min)of ammonia and 6 0.0 cc  per<br>
o	-1<br>
min air over VAPO(TPA-B) at 420  C and 0.5 hr    weight<br>
hourly space velocity of liquid feed. The 4-Picoline to ammonia mole ratio was 1:5. The yield of 4-cyanopyridine was 49.7% based on 4-picoline at 65.4% conversion of 4-picoline.No deactivation was observed for more than 6 hrs time on stream. The template TPA (tetra propyl ammonium bromide) was removed before the rec-tion. The activity can be regenerated.<br><br>
