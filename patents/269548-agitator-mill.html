				<td>Agitator mill<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an agitator mill according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An agitator mill of this type is known from EP 0 751 830 Bl. In this agitator mill the distance between the last agitator disc, which carries the cage, and the adjacent agitator disc is significantly smaller than the distance of the remaining agitating discs from one another. The reason lies in that, between the agitator discs with the exceptioi| of the last agitator disc the distance is such in each case that so-called braided flows develop, i.e. adjacent to the agitator discs the grinding stock together with the auxiliary grinding bodies flows outward as a result of the tangential momenta applied by the agitator discs. In the middle region between the adjacent agitator discs the grinding stock and the auxiliary grinding bodies flow back toward the agitator shaft. In order for the aforementioned braided flows to be able to develop, the distance between adjacent agitator discs must be sufficiently great. This distance is also defined by a so-called separation angle, which is enclosed by two lines. One line extends between a radially inward end of a agitator disc on the agitator shaft. The other line extends parallel to the axis of the agitator shaft. In order for such braided flows to develop, the objective is for the separation angle to be between 30° and 60°. In order to attain a particularly good separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies from the grinding stock including the not yet sufficiently ground grinding stock particles, the distance between the last agitator disc<br><br>
and the adjacent agitator disc is significantly reduced, such that a preliminary screening takes place there upstream of the separation device by avoiding the development of braided flows. This is intended to achieve that at least a substantial portion of the auxiliary grinding bodies and of the coarse, not yet sufficiently ground grinding stock particles does not enter into the separation device in the first place, in which a secondary separation of the remaining auxiliary grinding bodies and of the coarse, not yet sufficiently ground grinding stock particles does not enter into the separation device in the first place, in which a secondary separation of the remaining auxiliary grinding bodies and coarse grinding stock particles then takes place. This has the disadvantage that these measures cause the active grinding chamber to be reduced in size and the total separation area to be enlarged.<br>
An agitator mill comprising a grinding chamber surrounding a grinding vessel is known from EP 0 700 723 A, wherein a grinding stock inlet and a grinding stock discharge port are provided at the same end of the grinding chamber, A rotatably drivable agitator shaft is provided in the grinding chamber, on which agitator discs are arranged at equal distances from each other. A cylinder with passage slots is provided on the agitator disc adjacent to the grinding stock discharge port. Inside of this cylinder a wedge wire screen is arranged upstream of the grinding stock discharge port. Between - with reference to the flow of the grinding stock - the last agitator disc and an adjacent grinding vessel lid a relatively large free space is provided, from which inlet channels discharge into a return channel formed in the agitator shaft. At the agitator disc adjacent to the wedge filter screen a deflection roller is arranged forming a gap towards the adjacent agitator disc. The return channel discharges into this gap. The grinding stock, taking along the auxiliary grinding bodies, flows from the grinding<br><br>
stock inlet through the grinding chamber, where it is ground and dispersed in the known manner. In the relatively large free space between the last agitator disc and the adjacent grinding vessel lid, it flows into the return channel and through the same into the gap between the deflection roller and the adjacent agitator disc, where the auxiliary grinding bodies are centrifuged off outward and again taken along by the grinding stock entering the grinding chamber and returned to the grinding process.<br>
The object of the invention is to design an agitator mill of the generic type in such a way that a more intense grinding and dispersion process takes place without enlargement of the overall assembly length, while at the same time providing for a better separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies and any coarse, insufficiently ground grinding stock particles.<br>
This object is'Schieved according to the invention by the features in the characterizing part of claim 1. With the inventive measures it is achieved that an intense grinding and dispersion process takes place also between the last and the adjacent agitator disc, and the braided flows that are required for the process are formed in this region as well. The separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies and any coarse, insufficiently ground grinding stock particles takes place within the separation device. The intermediate wall rotating with the agitator prevents an axial collision of the auxiliary grinding bodies and coarse grinding stock particles with the end plate ending the screening device and causes the grinding stock and auxiliary grinding bodies being conveyed towards the cage at a high radial speed. The auxiliary grinding bodies and any coarse, not yet sufficiently ground particles are substantially centrifuged off radially through the apertures in the cage, whereas finely ground and dispersed grinding stock is redirected within the cage around the outer edge of the intermediate wall and<br><br>
discharged through the screen. The further developments according to claims 2 to 5 lead to an increase of these effects.<br>
By the development according to claim 6 it is more distinctively achieved that the described braided flows appear between the last agitator disc and the adjacent agitator disc, so that a grinding process of even intensity takes place as between the upstream agitator discs. The developments according to claim 7 and 8 have the same purpose.<br>
The development according to claim 9 leads to the grinding stock being conveyed completely through the passages into the gap space between the last agitator disc and the intermediate wall with the usual concentration of auxiliary grinding bodies.<br>
Additional advantages, features and details of the invention will become apparent from the following description of embodiments with reference to the drawing, in which:<br>
Fig. 1       shows an agitator mill in a schematic view in a side view in a partially cut-away view,<br>
Fig. 2       shows a first embodiment of the outlet region of the agitator mill,<br>
Fig. 3       shows a second embodiment of the outlet region of the agitator mill,<br>
Fig. 4       shows an agitator disc in a perspective view,<br><br>
Fig. 5       shows a last agitator disc with a cage in a perspective view, Fig. 6       shows an additional embodiment of an agitator disc,<br>
Fig. 7       shows an additional embodiment of a last agitator disc with a cage in a perspective view, and<br>
Fig. 8       shows a partial section through the last agitator disc along the section line VIII-VIII in Fig. 7.<br>
The agitator mill depicted in the drawing has a machine frame 1, on which a grinding vessel 2 is releasably mounted. Disposed in the machine frame 1 is a drive motor 3 that drives an agitator shaft 5 of an agitator 6 via a belt drive 4. The agitator shaft 5 is supported in the machine frame 1 in bearings 7 so as to be rotatable. In the grinding vessel 2 itself, specifically at its end opposite the machine frame 1, the agitator shaft 5 is not supported, i.e. it is supported cantilevered in the machine frame 1.<br>
The grinding vessel 2 is sealed relative to the machine frame 1 by means of a cover 8 that is penetrated by the agitator shaft 5, wherein a seal is effected by means of a shaft seal 9. In the region of the cover 8 a grinding stock inlet 11 opens into the grinding chamber 10, which is enclosed by the grinding vessel 2. From the end of the grinding vessel 2 opposite the grinding stock inlet 11a grinding stock discharge port 13 opens out from a bottom 12 that closes off the grinding chamber.<br><br>
Fixed to the agitator shaft 5 - as part of the agitator 6 - are agitator implements or agitator tools respectively designed in the form of agitator discs 14, wherein the agitator discs have openings 15 in their outer peripheral region. The distances a between adjacent agitator discs 14 in the direction of the axis 16 of the agitator shaft 5 are identical in each case. Only the distance of the agitator disc 14 immediately adjacent to the cover 8 from the cover 8 is smaller than the distance a-<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 2, the last agitator disc 17 of the agitator 6 adjacent to the bottom 12 is fastened by means of a fastening screw 18 to the agitator shaft 5. The axial distance a! of this agitator disc 17 from the adjacent second to last agitator disc 14 of the agitator 6 is identical to the aforementioned respective axial distances a between adjacent agitator discs 14. The diameters b of all agitator discs 14 and the diameter b' of the agitator disc 17 are identical as well.<br>
Formed on the outer periphery of the last agitator disc 17 is a cylindrical cage 19 that can be designed integral with the last agitator disc 17. It has a multiplicity of apertures 20 distributed over its periphery. Passages 22 that are formed adjacent to the agitator shaft 5 in the last agitator disc 17 open into the separation chamber 21 that is enclosed by the agitator disc 17 and the cage 19.<br>
Disposed in the separation chamber 21 on the bottom 12 concentrically to the axis 16 is a screening device 23. It is fastened to the bottom 12, specifically in a manner such that the screening device 23, after releasing thereof from the bottom 12 can be pulled out. It is thus connected to the grinding vessel 2 so as to not be rotatable. Opening out from the interior 24 of the screening device 23 is the grinding stock discharge port 13. The<br><br>
screening device 23 can be formed by annular discs that are disposed closely spaced on its cylindrical periphery in a known manner. The inside of the agitator disc 17, the cage 19 and the screening device 23 thus form a separation device 25. Adjacent to the agitator disc 17 the screening device 23 has a closed end plate 26. The interior 24 of the screening device 23 is thus connected to the separating chamber 21 only via the screening device 23.<br>
A closed intermediate wall 27 is arranged at the agitator 6 between the agitator disc 17 and the end plate 26, which rotates with the agitator 6 and defines a gap space 28. While this intermediate wall 27 in the embodiment according to Fig. 2 is fastened to the agitator shaft 5 by means of the fastening screw 18, the intermediate wall 27' in the embodiment according to Fig. 3 is fixed directly to the agitator disc 17 by means of wing-like spacers 29 that are distributed about the periphery. The intermediate walls 27 and 27', respectively, each extend radially at least beyond the end plate 26; such that c &gt; d, where c is the diameter of the intermediate wall 27 or 27', respectively, and d is the diameter of the end plate 26. Preferably c&gt; d, where the corresponding intermediate wall 27' extends to within a close distance from the cage 19.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 3 differs from the one according to Fig. 2 in that - on the side facing the adjacent agitator disc 14 - depressions 30 or recesses, respectively, of identical shape are formed with the openings 15 in the agitator 17', having the same cross section as the openings 15 but not leading into the separation chamber 21.<br><br>
The openings 15 in the agitator discs 14 can - as can be seen from Fig. 4 -have a circular cross section. The depressions 30 in the agitator disc 17' are accordingly designed circularly as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
According to Fig. 6 the openings 15' in the agitator discs 14 can have approximately the cross section of outwardly widening trapezoids. The same is true for the recesses 30' in the corresponding agitator disc 17', as can be seen from Fig. 7.<br>
The mode of operation is as follows:<br>
During the operation, the grinding chamber 10 is filled to a substantial degree with auxiliary grinding bodies 31. Through the grinding stock inlet 11 flowable grinding stock is pumped continuously through the grinding chamber 10 by means of a pump that is not shown. During the operation, the agitator 6 is driven in a rotating manner by the drive motor 3. The grinding stock flows through the grinding chamber 10 toward the grinding stock outlet that is formed by the grinding stock discharge port 13. During this flow it is subjected to strong shear stresses by the auxiliary grinding bodies 31, as a result of which grinding stock particles are ground and the grinding stock is additionally homogenized. This process takes place in such a way that braided flows 32 develop between adjacent agitator discs 14, and 14 and 17, respectively, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. They can be explained in such a way that the grinding stock and the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 are subjected to stronger tangential momenta adjacent to the respective agitator discs 14, and 14 and 17, respectively, than in the middle region between two adjacent agitator discs 14,17. The result of this is that, adjacent to the agitator discs 14, and 14 and 17, respectively, auxiliary grinding bodies 31 and grinding stock flow more to the outside, whereas in<br><br>
the middle region between two adjacent agitator discs 14, and 14 and 17, respectively, they flow back inward toward the agitator shaft 5. This grinding and homogenizing process is identical between all agitator discs 14 and 14,17, respectively, because of their respective identical distances a and a; and their respective identical diameters b and b' and their identical number of rotations. The depressions 30 ensure that the described braided flow 32 is identical to the above-described braided flows 32 also between the last agitator disc 17' and the adjacent agitator disc 14.<br>
Corresponding to the quantity of grinding stock flowing through the grinding chamber 10 per time unit, an axial flow through the grinding chamber 10 is superimposed on the braided flows 32. From the last braided flow 32 between the second to last agitator disc 14 and the agitator disc 17 partial flows of grinding stock and auxiliary grinding bodies 31 exit adjacent to the agitator shaft 5 through the passages 22 in the agitator disc 17 into the separating chamber 21 within the cage 19. The sum of these partial flows substantially corresponds to the volume flow of grinding stock that is fed in through the grinding stock inlet 11 and discharged through the grinding stock discharge port 13. The partial flows are redirected in the gap space 28 formed by the agitator disc 17 and the rotating intermediate wall 27 to the outside radially to the axis 16 and accelerated tangentially. As a result of the rotating movement of the agitator disc 17 and the intermediate wall 27 the grinding stock and the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 are again driven in the gap space 28 into an outwardly directed particularly high acceleration, which is true in particular for the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 and any potentially still remaining particularly coarse grinding stock particles. These grinding stock particles and the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 are centrifuged off to the outside through the apertures 20 of the cage 19 into an axial flow direction and discharged through the screening device<br><br>
23. The separation of the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 and, if applicable, any large grinding stock particles accordingly takes place only within the separation device 25.<br>
For the explanation of the relevant correlations between the diameter b of the agitator discs 14,17,17' and their axial distance a, a' for the development of the braided flows 32, it should be noted that a so-called separation angle a or p is being used for definition purposes. The separation angle a or P is formed between two lines 33 and 34. The line 33 extends from the inward end 35 of an agitator disc 14 on the agitator shaft 5 to the outer edge 36 of an adjacent agitator disc 14. The other line 34 is a line that is parallel to the axis 16. The separation angle p is the one between the last agitator disc 17 or 17' respectively, and the nearest adjacent agitator disc 14. In order for said braided flows 32 to develop, the following applies for the separation angle:<br>
30° 
Although agitator mills having a horizontal axis 16 were described in each of the presented embodiments, the invention is also applicable, of course, in agitator mills having a vertical axis.<br>
Lastly, the passages 22 in the agitator discs 17,17' can be designed actively conveying, as it is shown only in Fig. 8. The walls 37 of the passages in this case do not extend parallel to the axis 16 but are angled against the direction of rotation 38 and in the flow direction 39 - that is in the direction<br><br>
toward the intermediate wall 27 - trailing by an angle y relative to a line parallel to the axis 16. As a result of this, the grinding stock and the auxiliary grinding bodies 31 are drawn into the passages 22 and pushed through same into the gap space 28 with particular intensity. The sum of the above mentioned partial flows therefore in fact corresponds to approximately the total volume flow of grinding stock that is fed in through the grinding stock inlet 11 and discharged through the grinding stock discharge port 13, wherein in this region, because of the existing braided flow 32, the normal concentration of auxiliary grinding bodies 31 is present in the grinding stock, which are also transported along through the passages 22. In the above-described embodiment the following applied for the angle y: Y = 0°. For practical embodiments of actively conveying passages 22 the following applies: 0°
