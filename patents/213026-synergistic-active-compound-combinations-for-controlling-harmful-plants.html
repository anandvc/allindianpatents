Description<br>
Synergistic active compound combinations for controlling harmful plants<br>
The invention relates to the field of crop protection agents   in particular to combinations of groups of active compounds having different modes of action and types of activity, which are outstandingly suitable for use against harmful plants in crops of useful plants.<br>
In many crops of useful plants, harmful plants are undesirable competitors which can be controlled only with considerable expense and at high cost. They germinate and grow in the soil over prolonged periods of time and can therefore only be effectively controlled with herbicides having foliar and soil action.<br>
Examples of important weed grasses which occur in crops of useful plants all over the world and which are of high economic importance are: Alcopecurus myosuroides, Avena fatua and other forms of wild oat, Lolium spp., Phalaris spp., Setaria spp., Echinochloa spp., Poa spp., Bromus spp., Elymus repens, Sorghum spp. and others, such as Agrostis spp. and Panicum spp.<br>
It has been known for a relatively long time that some derivatives of 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-tria2ine substituted in the 6-position have herbicidal action.<br>
WO-A 97/08156, WO-A-97/31904, DE-A-19826670, WO-A-98/15536, WO-A-8/15537, WO-A-98/15538, WO-A-98/15539 and also DE-A-19828519, WO-A-98/34925, WO-A-98/42684, WO-A-99/18100, WO-A-99/19309 and WO-A-99/37627 describe relatively new classes of aminotriazine herbicides.<br>
The effectiveness of these herbicides against harmful plants in the crops is at a high level; however, it depends in general on the application rate, the respective formulation, the harmful plants to be controlled in each case or the spectrum of harmful plants, the climatic and soil conditions, etc. A further criterion is the duration of action, or the rate of degradation of the herbicide. Also to be taken into account are, if appropriate, changes in the<br><br>
susceptibility of harmful plants toward an active compound which may occur on prolonged use or geographically restricted. Activity losses in individual plants can only be compensated to a certain extent by higher application rates of the herbicides, tor example because this frequently decreases the selectivity of the herbicides, or an improvement in activity is not observed, even at higher application rates. In some cases, it is possible to improve the selectivity in crops by addition of safeners. In general, however, there is always a need for methods to achieve the herbicidal action with a lower application rate of active compounds. A lower application rate reduces not only the amount of an active compound which is required for the application, but generally also reduces the amount of formulation auxiliaries required. Both reduce the economic expense and improve the ecological compatibility of the herbicide treatment.<br>
One possibility for improving the property profile of a herbicide may consist in the combination of the active compound with one or more other active compounds which contribute the desired additional properties. However, when two or more active compounds are applied in combination, it is not uncommon for phenomena of physical and biological incompatibility to occur, for example lack of stability of a coformulation, decomposition of an active compound or antagonism of the active compounds. In contrast, what is desired are combinations of active compounds having a favorable activity profile, high stability and, if possible, synergistically enhanced activity, which permits a reduction of the application, compared with the individual application of the active compounds to be combined.<br>
In the publications cited above, it has already been proposed to combine the active compounds described with known herbicides, and an extensive list of possible combination partners has been given.<br>
However, indications of favorable, in particular synergistic, properties of specific combinations have not been given.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that active compounds from the group of the aminotriazine herbicides mentioned interact in a particularly favorable manner in combination with certain structurally different herbicides when used in crops of plants which are suitable for the selective use of the herbicides.<br><br>
Some herbicide combinations comprising, as one component, herbicides from the group of the 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazines have already been disclosed; cf. WO-A-98/10654, JP-A-10025211, WO-A-97/35481. JP-A-08198712, EP-A-573897 and EP-A-573898.<br>
The invention provides herbicide combinations which differ from the prior art or have technical advantages, and which comprise a syneryistically effective amount of components (A) and (B), where<br>
(A)      is one or more herbicidally active aminotriazine compounds having a partial structure of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
M<br><br>
(I)<br><br>
where<br>
L:       is a straight-chain or branched, optionally mono- or polysubstituted and/or -bridged alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, where one CH2 group may be replaced by O, N, S(0)x, where x is 0, 1 or 2, or by NO, or is a corresponding alkenylene or alkynylene group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms, where one CH2 group may be replaced by O, and which is optionally mono- or polysubstituted and/or -bridged, and M       is an unsubstituted or substituted aryl or heterocyclyl group, with the proviso that one of the two remaining radicals on the triazine ring is haloalkyi if -L- is a group of the formula -CH(CH3)-CH2-0-,<br>
and<br>
(B)     is one or more herbicides, de'fined further below, selected from<br>
the group of compounds consisting of<br>
(B1)   foliar- and/or  soil-acting  herbicides which  are active against monocotyledonous harmful plants,<br>
(82)	herbicides   which   are   active   against   predominantly dicotyledonous harmful plants and<br>
(83)	herbicides which are active against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants and optionally<br><br>
(B4)    herbicides which are active against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants and which can be employed specifically in tolerant crops or on non-crop land, except for combinations of herbicides of the formula (I')<br>

(H<br><br>

N<br><br>
N H<br><br>
in which<br>
X A<br>
is H or methyl,<br>
is a chlorine or fluorine atom and<br>
is a phenoxymethyl group which is unsubstituted in the phenyl<br>
ring or substituted by one or two radicals selected from the<br>
group consisting of methyl and fluorine, or<br>
is a benzofuran-2-yl or benzothiophen-2-yl radical,<br>
with herbicides from the group consisting of<br>
amidosulfuron, bensulfuron-methyl, chlorsulfuron, clopyralid,<br>
dicamba,  diclofop-methyl,  dithiopyr,  diuron,  fenoxaprop-(P)-<br>

thifensulfuron,  triasulfuron,  tribenuron-methyl,  triclopyr  and<br>
trifiuralln.<br><br>
The synergistic effects are observed when the active compounds (A) and (B) are appiied jointly; however, they can also frequently be observed when the active compounds are applied at different times (splitting). It is also possible to apply the herbicides or the herbicide combinations in a plurality of portions (sequential application), for example after pre-emergence applications, followed by post-emergence appiications or after early post-emergence applications, followed by medium or late post-emergence applications. Preference<br><br>
is given here to the joint or almost simultaneous application of the active compounds of the combination in question.<br>
The synergistic effects permit a reduction of the application rates of the individual active compounds, a higher place of activity at the same application rate, the control of harmful plants which were as yet uncontrolled (gaps), an extension of the period of application and/or a reduction in the number of individual applications required and - as a result for the user - weed control systems which are more advantageous economically and ecologically.<br>
The combinations according to the invention of (A)H-(B) permit, for example, synergistic increases in activity which, in an unexpected manner, exceed the activities which are achieved with the individual active compounds (A) and (B).<br>
The formula (I) mentioned embraces ail stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, in particular also racemic mixtures and - if enantiomers are possible, in each case the biologically active enantiomer or the biologically active enantiomers.<br>
The broken bonds in formula (I) denote bonds to substituents which occur at these positions in known compounds from the group of the herbidical triazines, or which are analogous to the substutuents of the known compounds, preferably substituents which are present in the known preferred compounds from the group of the herbicidal triazine.<br>

Among the safeners mentioned, (S1-1) and (SI-9) and (82-1), in particular (81-1) and (SI-9), are of particular interest.<br>
Some of the safeners have already been mentioned above as herbicides and consequently show, in addition to the herbicidal action against harmful plants, also protective action in connection with crop plants.<br>
The combinations according to the invention (= herbicidal compositions) have an outstanding herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. The active ingredients also act efficiently on perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, rootstocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control.<br>
Specifically, examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the compounds according to the invention, without the enumeration being a restriction to certain species.<br>
Examples of weed species on which the herbicidal compositions act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledonous weed species, Avena spp., Alopecurus spp., Brachiaria spp., Digitaria spp., Lolium spp., Echinochloa spp., Panicum spp., Phalaris spp., Poa spp., Setaria spp. and Cyperus species from the annual group, and, amongst the perennial species, Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum and also perennial Cyperus species.<br>
In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to species such as, for example, Abutilon spp., Amaranthus spp., Chenopodium spp., Chrysanthemum spp., Galium spp., Ipomoea spp., Kochia spp., Lamium spp., Matricaria spp., Pharbitis spp.. Polygonum spp.,<br><br>
Sida spp., Sinapis spp., Solanum spp., Stellaria spp., Veronica spp. and Viola spp., Xanthium spp., amongst the annuals, and-Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention are applied to the soil surface before germination, then the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging, or the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely.<br>
If the compositions are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth likewise stops drastically a very short time after the treatment and the weed plants remain at the growth stage of the point of time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated at a very early point in time and in a sustained manner.<br>
The herbicidal compositions according to the invention are distinguished by a rapidly commencing and long-lasting herbicidal action. As a rule, the rainfastness of the active ingredients in the combinations according to the invention is advantageous. A particular advantage is that the dosages of the compounds (A) and (B), which are used in the combinations and are effective, can be adjusted to such a low quantity that their soil action is optimally low. This does not only allow them to be employed in sensitive crops in the first place, but groundwater contaminations are virtually avoided. The active-ingredient combination according to the invention allows the application rate of the active ingredients required to be reduced considerably.<br>
When herbicides of the type (A)+(B) are used jointly, superadditive (= synergistic) effects are observed. This means that the effect in the combinations exceeds the expected total of the effects of the individual herbicides employed. The synergistic effects allow the application rate to be reduced, a broader spectrum of broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds to be controlled, the herbicidal action to take place more rapidly, the duration of action to be longer, the harmful plants to be controlled better while using only one, or few, applications, and the application period which is possible to be extended. In some cases, use of the compositions also<br><br>
reduces the amount of harmful constituents, such as nitrogen or oleic acid, and their entry into the ground.<br>
The aboveiviantioned properties and advantages are necessary for weed control practice to keep agricultural crops free from undesired competing plants and thus to guarantee and/or increase the yields from the qualitative and quantitative point of view. These novel combinations markedly exceed the technical state of the art with a view to the properties described.<br>
While the combinations according to the invention have an outstanding herbicidal activity against monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, the crop plants are damaged only to a minor extent, if at all. Moreover, some of the compositions according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulatory properties on the crop plants. They engage in the plants' metabolism in a regulatory manner and can thus be employed for provoking directed effects on plant constituents and to facilitate hanyesting such as for example by triggering desiccation and stunted growth. Moreover, they are also suitable for the general control and inhibition of undesired vegetative growth without simultaneously destroying the plants. An inhibition of vegetative growth is very important in a large number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops since lodging can thus be reduced, or prevented completely.<br>
Owing to their herbicidal and plant-growth-regulatory properties, the compositions can be employed for controlling harmful plants in known plant crops or tolerant or genetically modified crop plants still to be developed. The transgenic plants are generally distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, such as resistances to plant diseases or causative agents of plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses in addition to resistances to the compositions according to the invention. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storabiiity, composition and specific constituents. Thus, for example, transgenic plants are known whose starch content is increased or whose starch quality is altered, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
Conventional methods of generating novel plants which have modified properties in comparison to plants occurring to date consist, for example, in<br><br>
traditional breeding methods and the generation of mutants. Alternatively, novel plants with altered properties can be generated with,the aid of recombinant methods (see, for example, EP-A-0221044, EP-A-0131624). For example, the following have been described in several cases:<br>
the modification, by recombinant technology, of crop plants with the<br>
aim of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (for example<br>
WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827, WO 91/19806),<br>
transgenic crop plants which exhibit resistancesJ;o-other herbicides,<br>
for example to sulfonylureas (EP-A-0257993, US-A-5013659),<br>
transgenic crop plants with the capability of producing Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins), which make the plants resistant to<br>
certain pests (EP-A-0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
transgenic  crop  plants  with  a  modified fatty  acid  composition<br>
(WO 91/13972).<br>
A large number of techniques in molecular biology are known in principle with the aid of which novel transgenic plants with modified properties can be generated: see, for example, Sambrook et al,, 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker "Gene und Klone", VCH Weinheim 2nd Edition 1996 or Christou, "Trends in Plant Science" 1 (1996) 423-431). To carry out such recombinant manipulations, nucleic acid molecules which allow mutagenesis or sequence changes by recombination of DNA sequences can be introduced into plasmids. For example, the abovementioned standard methods allow base exchanges to be carried out, subsequences to be removed, or natural or synthetic sequences to be added. To connect the DNA fragments to each other, adapters or linkers may be added to the fragments.<br>
For example," the generation of plant cells with a reduced activity of a gene product can be achieved by expressing at least one corresponding antisense RNA, a sense RNA for achieving a cosuppression effect or by expressing at least one suitably constructed ribosome which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product.<br>
To this end, it is possible to use, on the one hand, DNA molecules which encompass the entire coding sequence of a gene product inclusive of any flanking sequences which may be present, as well as DNA molecules<br><br>
which only encompass portions of the coding sequence, it being necessary for these portions to be long enough to have an antisense effect on the ceiis. The use of DNA sequences which have a high degree of horri^oiogy to the encoding sequences of a gene product, but are not completely identical to them, is also possible.<br>
When expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the protein synthesized can be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a particular compartment, it is possible, for example, to link the coding region with DNA sequences which ensure localization in a particular compartment. Such sequences are known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. 11 (1992). 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al.. Plant J. 1 (1991), 95^106).<br>
The transgenic plant cells can be regenerated by known techniques to give rise to intact plants. In principle, the transgenic plants can be plants of any desired plant species, i.e. not only monocotyledonous, but also dicotyledonous, plants. Thus, transgenic plants can be obtained whose properties are altered by overexpression, suppression or inhibition of homologous (= natural) genes or gene sequences or the expression of heterologous (= foreign) genes or gene sequences.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to a method of controlling undesired<br>
vegetation, preferably in plant crops, which comprises applying one or<br>
more compositions of type (A) together with one or more herbicides of type<br>
(B) to the  harmful  plants,  parts of these plants,  or the area under<br>
cultivation.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the herbicidal compositions of<br>
compounds (A)+(B) for controlling harmful plants, preferably in plant crops.<br>
The active ingredient combinations according to the invention can exist not only as mixed formulations of the two components, if appropriate together with further active ingredients, additives and/or customary formulation auxiliaries, which are then applied in the customary manner as a dilution with water, but also as so-called tank mixes by jointly diluting the separately formulated, or partially separately formulated, components with water.<br>
The compounds (A) and (B) or their combinations can be formulated in various ways, depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemical-<br><br>
physical parameters. The following are examples of general possibilities for formulations: wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EG), aqueb't/s- solutions (SL), emulsions (EW) such as oil-in-water and water-Trt-^ oil emulsions, sprayable Solutions or emulsions, oil- or water-based dispersions, suspoemulsions, dusts (DP), seed-dressing materials, granules for soil application or for broadcasting, or water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules or waxes.<br>
The individual formulation types are known in principle and are described for example, in; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie", Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition, 1986; van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 1973; K, Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The formulation auxiliaries required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and are described, for example, in Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry"; 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons. N.Y. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1950; McCutcheon's, "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridegewood NJ.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Egents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Verlagsgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1976, Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie", Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations, combinations with other pesticidally active substances, such as other herbicides, fungicides or insecticides, and with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, may also be prepared, for example in the form of a readymix or a tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders (sprayable powders) are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active ingredient, also comprise ionic or nonionic surfactants (wetters, dispersants), for example polyoxethylated alkylphenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols or fatty amines, alkanesulfonates or alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate,   sodium   2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6*-disulfonate,   sodium<br><br>
dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltauride, in addition to a diluent or inert material.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else higher-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons with addition of one or more ionic or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers), Examples of emulsifiers which may.hf? used are: calcium salts of alkylarylsulfonic acids, such as Ca dodecylbenzene sulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxethylene sorbitol esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active ingredient with finely divided solid materials, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active ingredient onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active ingredient concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material with the aid of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active ingredients may also be granulated in the manner conventionally used for the production of fertilizer granules, if desired in a mixture with fertilizers. In general, water-dispersible granules are prepared by processes such as spray drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing with highÂ¬speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material.<br>
In general, the agrochemical formulations comprise 0.1 to 99 percent by weight, in particular 2 to 95% by weight, of active ingredients of the types A and/or B, the following concentrations being customary, depending on the type of formulation:<br>
The active ingredient concentration in wettable powders is, for example, approximately 10 to 95% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation constituents. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active ingredient concentration may amount to, for example, 5 to 80% by weight.<br><br>
Formulations in the form of dusts comprise, in most cases, 5 to 20% by weight of active ingredient, sprayable solutions approximately 0.2 to 25% by weight of active ingredient.<br>
In the case of granules such as dispersible granules, the active ingredient content depends partly on whether the active compound is present in liquid or solid form and on which granulation auxiliahes and fillers are being used. As a rule, the content amounts to between 10 and 90% by weight in the case of the water-dispersible granules.<br>
In addition, the abovementioned active ingredient formulations may comprise, if appropriate, the conventional adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, colorants, carriers, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors, pH regulators or viscosity regulators, thickeners, fertilizers and/or dyes.<br>
For use, the formulations, which are present in commercially available form, are optionally diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emuisifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, soil granules, granules for broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not diluted further with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The active ingredients can be applied to the plants, parts of the plants, seeds of the plants or the area under cultivation (soil of the field), preferably to the green plants and parts of the plants and, if appropriate, additionally to the soil of the field.<br>
One possible use is the joint application of the active ingredients in the form of tank mixes, the concentrated formulations of the individual active ingrfedients, in optimal formulations, jointly being mixed with water in the tank and the resulting spray mixture being applied.<br>
A joint herbicidal formulation of the combination according to the invention of the active ingredients (A) and (B) has the advantage of being easier to apply since the quantities of the components are already presented in the correct ratio to each other. Moreover, the adjuvants in the formulation can be matched optimally to each other, while a tank mix of different formulations may lead to undesired combinations of adjuvants.<br><br>

Biological examples<br>
1.        Pre-emergence effect on weeds<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed plants are placed in sandy loam soil in pots and covered with soil. The compositions, formulated in the form of concentrated aqueous solutions, wettable powders or emulsion concentrates, are then applied to the surface of the soil cover as aqueous solution, suspension or emulsion at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted), in various dosages. After the treatment, the pots are placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for the weeds. After the test plants have emerged, the damage to the plants or the negative effects on the emergence is scored visually after a test period of 3 to 4 weeks by comparison with untreated controls. As shown by the test results, the compositions according to the invention have good herbicidal pre-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds.<br>
Scoring and evaluation of the synergistic herbicidal effects:<br>
The herbicidal efficacy of the active compounds or active compound mixtures was scored visually using the treated plots in comparison to untreated control plots. The damage and development of all above-ground parts of the plants were recorded. Scoring was carried out using a percentage scale (100% effect = all plants killed; 50% effect = 50% of the plants and the green parts of the plants killed; 0% effect = no noticeable effect = like control plot. The scores of in each case 4 plots were averaged.<br>
When using the combinations according to the invention, herbicidal effects on a harmful plant species are frequently'observed which exceed the formal sum of the activities of the herbicides contained in the combination when applied on their own. Alternatively, in some cases, it can be observed that a lower application rate is required for the herbicide combination in order to obtain, compared to the individual preparations, the same effect on a harmful plant species. Such activity increases or increases in effectiveness or reduced application rates are a strong indication of a synergistic effect.<br><br>
If the observed activity values already exceed the formal sum of the values for the trials with the individual applications, they also exceed the expected value according to Colby which is calculated using the following formula and which is likev^^ise considered to be an indication of synergism (cf. S. R. Colby; in Weeds 1'5 (1967) p. 20 to 22):<br>
E = A+B-(AxB/100)<br>
The figures denote: A, B = activity of the active compounds A or B in % at an application rate a or b g of a.s./ha; E = expected value in % of the active compound combination at an application rate of a+b g of a.s./ha (a.s. = active substance).<br>
The observed test results show, at suitable low dosages, an effect of the combinations which exceeds the formal sum of the effects in the case of individual application or the expected values according to Colby.<br>
2.       Post-emergence effect on weeds<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds are placed in sandy loam soil in pots, covered with soil and grown in a greenhouse under good growth conditions (temperature, atmospheric humidity, water supply). Three weeks after sowing, the test plants are treated at the three-leaf stage with the compositions according to the invention. The compositions according to the invention, formulated as wettable powders or as emulsion concentrates, are sprayed, at various dosages, onto the green parts of the plant at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted). After the test plants have been in the greenhouse for about 3 to 4 weeks under ideal growth conditions, the effect of the preparations'is scored visually by comparison with untreated controls (cf. Section 1). The compositions according to the invention also have a good herbicidal post-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of economically important weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds. Frequently, activities of the combinations according to the invention are observed which exceed the formal sum of the activities when the herbicides are applied individually. The observed test results show, at suitable low dosages, an effect of the combinations which exceeds the formal sum of<br><br>
the effects in the case of individual application or the expected values according to Colby.<br>
3. Herbicidal effect and crop plant compatibility (field trials)<br>
Crop plants were grown outdoors on plots under natural outdoor conditions, and seeds or rhizome pieces of typical harmful plants were laid out or the natural weed growth was utilized. Treatment with the compositions according to the invention was carried out after the harmful plants had emerged and the crop plants were, generally, at the 2- to 4-leaf stage; in some cases (as stated), application of individual active compounds or active compound combinations was carried out pre-emergence (cf. Section 1) or post-emergence (cf. Section 2) or as a sequential treatment partly pre-emergence and/or post-emergence. After the application, for example 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after the application, the effect of the preparations was scored visually by comparison with untreated controls (cf. scoring in Section 1). In the field trial as well, the compositions according to the invention have synergistic herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds. The comparison showed that the combinations according to the invention in most cases have a higher, in some cases a considerably higher, herbicidal activity than the sum of the activities of the individual herbicides, thus indicating synergism. Moreover, the effects in essential phases of the scoring period were above the expected values according to Colby, also indicating synergism. In contrast, the crop plants were, as a consequence of the treatments with the herbicidal compositions, damaged only to a small degree, if at all.<br>
