DESCRIPTION<br>
OPTICAL DISK AND ITS  MANUFACTURING METHOD<br>
5                                                     TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an optical disk such as a Biu-ray disk (BD) or<br>
digital versatile disk (DVD) and manufacturing method of the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
10              Polycarbonate, epoxy resin and so forth have frequently been used as the substrate<br>
materials of conventional optical disks since these substrate materials are required to<br>
have low contents of extraneous materials and impurities, high permeability and low<br>
double refractive index to enable stable reading end writing, a low  Moisture absorption<br>
rate and superior heat resistance to prevent deformation of  the optical disk, as well as<br>
15 high fluidity and superior mold release to facilitate molding processing (Japanese<br>
Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 05-258349),<br>
However, since bisphenol A is used as monomer for the aforementioned<br>
polycarbonate and epoxy resin substrate materials, unreacted bisphenol A remained even<br>
after polymerization. Due to the growing interest in environmental issues in recent<br>
20 years, materials containing bisphenol A have tended to be shunned, and studies have been<br>
conducted on substrate materials that do not contain bisphenol A,<br>
The use of glass has been considered for use as a substrate material since it does<br>
not contain bisphenol A and satisfactory optical characteristics in the form of high<br>
transmittance. However, glass substrates have problems, in terms of strength in that they<br>
25 are unable to accommodate the pressure and stress during production, and use due to<br><br>
2<br>
limitations on disk thickness.<br>
An optical disk in which an optical recording layer is formed on a substrate surface<br>
composed of a biodegradable resin is proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application, First Publication No. 2000-11448 as an optical disk that has a minimal<br>
5 effect on the environment at the time of disposal. However, in the production of this<br>
optical disk since surface irregularities in the form of  pits are stamped directly onto the<br>
surface of a disk-shaped substrate that has been punched out from an extruded sheet<br>
(refer to paragraphs 0018 through 0019), there is the problem of difficulty in stamping<br>
the pits. In addition, there is also the problem of  increased susceptibility to warping of<br>
10 the substrate due to moisture absorption resulting in impaired reading of information.<br>
Another problem with conventional optical disks is that, although silk screen<br>
printing bas mainly been used in the case of printing characters or images on the surface,<br>
there is the problem of the difficulty in obtaining highly detailed images with silk screen<br>
printing.<br>
15               In addition, in the case of silk screen printing, in order to print serial numbers or<br>
other different characters and images for each disk, it is necessary to change the form<br>
plate each time, thereby resulting in the problem of being unable to in fact impart<br>
variable information by printing to conventional optical disks.<br>
Accordingly, an object of  the present invention is to provide an optical disk that<br>
20 has performance equal to that of conventional optical disks, has a minimal effect on the<br>
environment during disposal and is able to suppress warping of the substrate, as well as a<br>
manufacturing method that allows this optical disk to be obtained easily and<br>
inexpensively.<br>
In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk on<br>
25 which highly detailed images are printed, and manufacturing method of art optical disk<br><br>
3<br>
that enables highly detailed images to be printed inexpensively and impart variable<br>
information by printing.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

resin or polyolefin resin and a recording layer provided on both sides of the substrate,<br>
and the recording layer has a base material layer included a non-hydrophilic film.<br>
In addition, an optical disk of the present invention has a substrate included a<br>
biodegradable resin or polyotefin resin, a recording layer provided on one side of the<br>
10 substrate, and a printing layer provided on the opposite side of the side of the substrate<br>
on which the recording layer is provided, and the recording layer and the printing layer<br>
have a base material layer included a non-hydrophilic film.<br>
Since this type of optical disk uses a substrate included biodegradable resin or<br>
polyalefin resin for the substrate, it has a minimal effect on the environment during<br>
15 disposal while retaining performance that is equal to that of optical disks of the prior art<br>
In addition, since a recording layer is provided on both sides of the substrate or  a<br>
recording layer is provided on one side of the substrate while a printing layer is provided<br>
on the other side of the substrate, and the recording layer and printing layer have a base<br>
material layer included a non-hydrophilic film, water absorption and moisture absorption<br>
20 of the substrate can be suppressed, thereby making it possible to suppress warping and<br>
other deformation of the optical disk.<br>
In addition, if the substrate additionally bas a protective layer that protect the<br>
aforementioned recording layer, then together with preventing scratching of the recording<br>
layer, water absorption and moisture absorption of the substrate can be further suppressed,<br>
25 and warping and other deformation of the optical disk can be further suppressed.<br><br>
4<br>
In addition, if a release layer is provided between the substrate and the recording<br>
layer and/or printing layer, since the substrate and recording layer and/or printing layer<br>
can be separated and disposed of separately at the time of disposal, each layer can be<br>
disposed of in accordance with the material of which it is made, thereby making it<br>
5 possible to further reduce the effect on the environment.<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention has a<br>
recording layer sheet fabrication step in which a recording layer sheet is fabricated by<br>
forming tracks on a recording layer base material included a non-hydrophilic film; and, a<br>
recording layer sheet lamination step in which a recording layer included the recording<br>
10 layer sheet is provided on both sides of a substrate included a biodegradable resin or<br>
polyolefin resin by laminating the recording layer sheet with a substrate sheet included a<br>
biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin.<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention has a<br>
recording layer sheet fabrication step in which a recording layer sheet is fabricated by<br>
15 forming tracks on a recording layer base material included a non-hydrophilic film, a<br>
printing sheet fabrication step in which a printing sheet is fabricated by carrying out<br>
printing on a printing base material included a non-hydrophilic film, a recording layer<br>
sheet lamination step in which a recording layer included the recording layer sheet is<br>
provided on a substrate included a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin by laminating<br>
20 the recording layer sheet with a substrate sheet included a biodegradable resin or<br>
polyolefin resin, and a printing sheet lamination step in which a printing layer included<br>
the printing sheet is provided on a substrate included a biodegradable resin or polyolefin<br>
resin by laminating the printing sheet with a substrate sheet included a biodegradable<br>
resin or polyolefin resin-<br>
25               In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention also<br><br>
5<br>
preferably has a protective film lamination step in which a protective layer included a<br>
protective film is provided on the recording layer by laminating the protective film onto<br>
the recording layer<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention also<br>
5 preferably has a release layer formation step in which a release layer is formed on at least<br>
one side of the substrate sheet in advance.<br>
In addition, manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention<br>
preferably produces each sheet in the form of a wound roll and then laminates each of<br>
these sheets in the form of wound rolls.<br>
10               In this type of the manufacturing method of an optical disk, since the substrate,<br>
recording layer and as necessary, printing layer and protective layer, are formed by<br>
prefabricating their corresponding sheets in advance followed by their lamination, an<br>
optical disk having little substrate warping can be produced easily and inexpensively.<br>
In addition, since the manufacturing method has fabricating a printing sheet by<br>
15 carrying out printing on a printing base material in advance followed by laminating it to<br>
the substrate, highly detailed images can be obtained easily and inexpensively. In<br>
addition, variable information, such as sequentially changing serial numbers, that differs<br>
for each disk can be imparted by printing onto the optical disk.<br>

An optical disk of the present invention is that having a substrate composed of a<br>
biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin and a recording layer provided on both sides of<br>
the substrate, or that having a substrate composed of a biodegradable resin or polyoiefin<br>
15 resin, a recording layer provided on one side of the substrate, and a printing layer<br>
provided on the opposite side from the side of the substrate on which the recording layer<br>
is provided, and also has a release layer between the substrate and recording layer as<br>
necessary.<br>
Specific examples of the layer composition of an optical disk of the present<br>
20 invention include: (1) recording layer/substrate/printing layer, (2) recording layer/<br>
substrate/recording layer, (3) protective layer/recording layer/substrate/printing layer, (4)<br>
protective layer/ recording layer/substrate/ recording layer/protective layer, (5)<br>
protective layer/recording layer/release layer/ substrate/printing layer, (6) protective<br>
layer/recording layer/release layer/substrate /release layer/ printing layer, and (7)<br>
25 protective layer/ recording layer/release layer/substrate/release layer/ recording layer/<br><br>
7<br>
protective layer. Here, a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer for laminating each layer<br>
may be provided between each layer as necessary.<br>
The following provides an explanation of an optical disk having the layer<br>
composition of (3) above with reference to the drawings.<br>
5               FIG 1 is schematic cross-sectional view showing an example of an optical disk of<br>
the present invention. This optical disk 10 is roughly composed having a substrate 11<br>
composed of a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin, a recording layer 13 laminated on<br>
one side of substrate 11 with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 interposed between, a<br>
printing layer 15 laminated on the other side of substrate 11 with a pressure-sensitive<br>
10 adhesive layer 14 interposed between, and a protective layer 17 laminated on recording<br>
layer 13 with a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16 interposed between.<br><substrate><br>
Substrate 11 retains strength required for use as an optical disk, and is required to<br>
have rigidity, moisture resistance and water resistance. It is also required to have a<br>
15 minimal effect on the environment during disposal. Consequently, in the present<br>
invention, a substrate composed of a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin is used for<br>
the substrate. A biodegradable resin has a minimal effect on the environment since it is<br>
decomposed by microbes in the soil and so forth even if disposed of as is. to addition, a<br>
polyolefin resin has a minimal effect on the environment since it can be disposed of by<br>
20 incineration and so forth and is broken down into water and carbon dioxide as a result of<br>
incineration.<br>
Polylactic acid resin, for example, can be used as a biodegradable resin.<br>
Poly lactic acid resin, for example, can be used as a biodegradable resin. Examples of<br>
polylactic acid resins include "Ecoloju" manufactured by Mitsubishi Plastics Inc.,<br>
25 "Terramac" manufactured by Unitika, Ltd., and "Palgreen LC" manufactured by Tohcello<br><br>
8<br>
Co., Ltd. In addition, copolymer polyesters of polyvalent alcohols such as 1, 4butadiol<br>
and pentaerythritol, and succinic acid or adipic acid, for example, can also be used as<br>
biodegradable resins. Examples of this type of biodegradable polyester resins include<br>
"Biomax" manufactured by DuPout and "Bionolle" manufactured by Showa High<br>
5 Polymer Co., Ltd.<br>
Preferably examptes of polyolefin resins include low density polyethylene (LDPE),<br>
linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE),<br>
polypropylene, non-crystalline cyclic polyolefins, tetracyclododecene polymers and<br>
cycloolefin polymers- HDPE, polypropylene, non-crystalline cyclic polyolefins,<br>
10 tetracyctododecene polymmers and cycloolefin polymers are particularly preferable with<br>
respect to rigidity.<br>
In addition, a drawn film (drawn sheet), in which a film composed of a<br>
biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin is drawn, is preferable for substrate 11 with<br>
respect to mechanical strength and transparency.<br>
15              The thickness of substrate 11 is preferably 0.5 to 2.0 mm in consideration of<br>
optical disk strength and optical disk specifications,<br><recording layer><br>
Recording layer 13 is a layer on which information is recorded and/or a layer on<br>
which information can be recorded, and is able to record and/or read information by<br>
20 being irradiated with light.<br>
Recording layer 13 includes that on which information has been recorded in<br>
advance at the time of optical disk production, and that on which information can be<br>
recorded after production, and is normally classified into one of three types consisting of:<br>
(1) that on which information is recorded in advance at the time of optical disk<br>
25 production but on which information cannot be recorded after production (playback-only<br><br>
9<br>
type); (2) thai on which information is not recorded at the time of optical disk production<br>
but on which information can be recorded after production, (write-once type); and, (3)<br>
that from which recorded information can be erased and on which information can be<br>
re-recorded (rewritable type).<br>
5              The following provides a detailed explanation of each type of  recording layet.<br>
(Playback-Only Type)<br>
FIG12 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a playback-only type of<br>
recording layer. This recording layer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 31 (base material layer), an information pit forming layer 32 having<br>
10 irregularities in its surface formed on the surface of recording layer base material 31, and<br>
a light reflecting layer 33 that covers the surface irregularities of  information pit forming<br>
layer 32, and the side having recording layer base material 31 contacts a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 (not shown), while the side having light reflecting<br>
layer 33 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16.<br>
15              Recording layer base material 31 server as a support af recording layer 13. A<br>
non-hydrophilic film is used for recording layer base material 31 in consideration of<br>
suppressing water absorption and moisture absorption by substrate 11. There are no<br>
particular limitations entire non-hydiophilic film provided it is a film composed of a<br>
resin that does not contain bisphenol A.<br>
20              Preferable examples of a non-bydrophilic film in particular include polyolefin<br>
films composed of low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene<br>
(LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, non-crystalline cyclic<br>
polyofefins, tetracyclododecene polymers or cycloolefin polymers in nonsideration of<br>
enabling disposal by incineration and minimal effects on the environment as a result of<br>
25 being decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by incineration.<br><br>
10<br>
In addition, a biodegradable resin film is preferable for the non-hydrophilic film in<br>
consideration of minimal effects on the environment as a result of being decomposed by<br>
microbes in the soil and so forth even if disposed directly; The same biodegradable<br>
resins used for the aforementioned substrate 11 can be used for the biodegradable resin,<br>
5               The thickness of the non-hydrophilic film is preferably 30 mm or more in<br>
consid ation of maintaning the strength of a support.<br>
Information pit forming layer 32 has irregularities in its surface, and tracks and<br>
information pits are represented by these surface irregularities. Information pit forming<br>
layer 32 is the result of curing an ultraviolet-cured resin in which a photoinitiator is<br>
10 combined with an oligomer or monomer such as urethane acrylate oligomer, polyester<br>
acrylate oligomer or low-viscosity acrylic monomer; and using an electron beam-cured<br>
resin such as urethane-denatured acrylate resin or acrylic-denatured polyester resin.<br>
However, it is preferable not to use an epoxy resin that contains bisphenol A.<br>
The thickness of information pit forming layer 32 is normally 20 to 80 nm,<br>
15              Ligta reflecting Layer 33 is provided, along the surface irregularitiss of information<br>
pit forming layer 32 and reflects irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 33 is a thin film<br>
composed of a metal such as aluminum, aluminum alloy, silver or silver alloy formed by,<br>
for example, vacuum deposition or sputtering.<br>
The thickness of light reflecting layer 33 is normally 10 to 100 nm, and the<br>
20 thickness is preferably uniform.<br>
(Write-Once Type)<br>
FIG 3 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a write-once type of<br>
recording layer. This recording teyer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 41 (base material layer), an. information track farming layer 42 having<br>
25 irregularities in its surface formed on the surface of recording layer base material 41, a<br><br>
11<br>
light reflecting foyer 43 that covers the surface irregu1arities of infomation track. forming<br>
layer 42, and an information pit recording layer 44 formed on the surface of light<br>
reflecting layer 43, and the side of recording layer base material 41 contacts a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 (not shown), while the side of  information pit<br>
5 recording layer 44 contacts a pressures-sensitve adhesive layer 16.<br>
Recording layer base material 41 serves as a support of recording layer 13. The<br>
same non-hydrophilic films as the aforementioned recording layer base material 31 can<br>
be used for recording layer base material 41.<br>
Information track forming layer 42 has irregularities in its surface having a depth<br>
10 of 50 to 110 nm, and tracks are represented by these surface irregularities. However,<br>
differing from a playback-only type, information pits are not formed. An<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin or electron beam-cured resin is cured in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned information pit forming layer 32 for information track forming layer 42.<br>
Light reflecting layer 43 is provided along the surface irregularities of information<br>
15 track forming layer 42, and reflects  irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 43 is a metal<br>
thin film formed by vacuum deposition or sputtering in the same mannner as the<br>
aforementioned light reflecting layer 33.<br>
Information pit recording layer 44 is a colored film composed of, for example, an<br>
organic pigment, and as a result of  being irradiated with laser light for information<br>
20 recording, this portion becomes information pits where information signals are recorded<br>
as a result of undergoing a physical change (destruction) following the occurrence of a<br>
change in the molecular structure of organic pigment at the irradiated site. Since the<br>
site where the physical change has occurred decreases in optical transmittance, when<br>
irradiated with light for reading, the amount of reflected light from light reflecting layer<br>
25 43 decreases, and as a result, information signals can be detected in the same manner as<br><br>
12<br>
in the case of surface irregularity pits being formed.<br>
Examples of organic pigments include phthalocyanine pigment, naphthalocyanine<br>
pigment and naphthoquinore pigment.<br>
The thickness of information pit recording layer 44 is normally 50 to 200 nm,<br>
5               (Rewritable Type)<br>
FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view showing an example of a rewritable type of<br>
recording layer. This recording layer 13 is roughly composed having a recording layer<br>
base material 51 (base material layer), art information track forming layer 52 having<br>
irregularities in its surface formed on the surface of recording layer base material 51, a<br>
10 light reflecting layer 53 that covers the surface irregularities of information track forming<br>
layer 52, and an information pit recording layer 54 formed on the surface of light<br>
reflecting layer 53, and the side of recording layer base material 51 contacts a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 (not shown), while the side of information pit<br>
recording layer 54 contacts a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16.<br>
15               Recording layer base material 51 serves as a support of recording layer 13. The<br>
same non-hydophilic films as the aforementioned recording layer base material 31 can<br>
be usad for recording layer base material 51,<br>
Information track forming layer 52 has irregularities in its surface having a depth<br>
of 50 to 110 nm, and tracks are represented by these surface irregularities, However,<br>
20 differing from a playback-only type, information pits are not formed. An<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin or electron beam-cured resin can be cured in the same manner as<br>
the aforementioned information pit forming layer 32 for information track forming layer<br>
52.<br>
Light reflecting layer 53 is provided along the surface irregularities of information<br>
25 track forming layer 52, and reflects irradiated light. Light reflecting layer 53 is a metal<br><br>
13<br>
thin film formed by vacuum deposition or sputtering in the same manner as the<br>
aforementioned light reflecting layer 33.<br>
Information pit recording layer 54 is a transparent dielectric film composed of<br>
three layers consisting of, for example an SiO2 film, GeSbTe film and SiO2 film, and the<br>
5 information pit recording layer shown in the drawing has a bilayer  structure laminated in<br>
the order of SiO2 film 61, GeSbTe film 62, SiO2 film 63, GeSbTe film 64 and SiO2 film<br>
65.<br>
The recording, erasure and reading of information by information pit recording<br>
layer 54 is carried out in the manner described below.<br>
10              Laser light is focused on a GeSbTe film to heat this film followed by rapid cooling<br>
to record information by polycrystallizing or decrystallizing the GeSbTe film. Laser<br>
light that is weak enough not to affect the GeSbTe film is irradiated, the laser light<br>
penetrates the polyerystalttzied oi decrystallized GeSbTe film, and the light reflected by<br>
the light reflecting layer is received allowing information to be read depending on<br>
15 whether or not there is crystall ization of the GeSbTe film. On the other hand,<br>
information is erased by crystallizing the GeSbTe film as a result of focusing laser light<br>
of a lower intensity onto a polycrystallizad or decrystallized GeSbTe film to slowly heat<br>
the film. This recording and erasure is reversible, and different information can again<br>
be recorded after a recording has been erased.<br>
20              A  ZnS1O2 film, fa2O5 film, SiN film or AIN film can be used instead of an SiO2<br>
film. In addition, an AgInSbTe film, can be used instead of a GeSbTe film.<br>
Each of these films can be formed by sputtering, vacuum deposition and so forth-<br>
The thickness of each film is roughly 10 to 300 nm, and should be suitably set<br>
according to the type and number of layers. For example, the thickness of each film of<br>
25 infomation pit recording layer 54 is 220 nm for the SiO2 film, 13 nm for the GeSbTe<br><br>
14<br>
film, 25 ran for the SiO2 film, 40 nm for the GeSbTe film and 95 nm for the SiO2 film in<br>
that order.<br><printing layer><br>
Printing layer 15 is formed by printing by printing ink 22 on printing base material<br>
5 21 (base material layer). Here, although printing is carried out on the side of<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 14, namely on the back side of printing base material 21,<br>
this is preferable since in addition to being able to protect the printed surface composed<br>
of printing ink 22, unique images having both luster and depth can be obtained,<br>
A non-hydrophilic film is used for printing base material 21 in consideration of<br>
10 suppressing water absorption and moisture absorption by substrate 11. There are no<br>
particular limitations on the non-hydrophilic film provided it is a film that does not<br>
contain bisphenol A.<br>
Preferable examples of a non-hydrophilic film in particular include polyolefin<br>
films in consideration of enabling disposal by incineration and minimal effects on the<br>
15 environment as a result of being decomposed into water and carbon dioxide by<br>
incineration. In a addition, a biodegradable resin film is preferable for the<br>
non-hydrophilic film in consideration of minimal effects on the environment as a result<br>
of being decomposed by microbes in the soil and so forth even if disposed of directly.<br>
The same films as those used in the aforementioned recording layer base material<br>
20 31 can he used for the polyolefin film and biodegradable resin film.<br>
The thickness of printing base material 21 is normally 12 to 80 mm.<br>
There are no particular limitations on printing ink 22 provided it does not contain<br>
bisphenol A. An example of printing ink 22 is a printing ink having a biodegradable<br>
resin such as poly lactic acid resin as a binder while also containing various types of<br>
25 additives in consideration of minimal effects on the environment during disposal.<br><br>
15<br>
Examples of additives include coloring pigments, pigment dispersants and viscosity<br>
adjusters.<br>
Examples of characters and images formed by printing include markings that at<br>
least indicate the type of optical disk, additional information relating to the optical disk<br>
S (such as manufacturer, retailer, price, storage capacity and usage precautions), and<br>
full-color decorative images having intermediate gradations (such as images of the<br>
recorded information). In addition, an area enabling the writing of additional<br>
information with a pencil, ballpoint pen or ink jet printer and so forth may also be<br>
provided.<br>
10               <protective layer><br>
Protective layer 17 protects the surface of recording layer 13 and prevents damage<br>
to the recording layer. In addition, protective layer 17 also fulfills the role of<br>
suppressing water absorption and moisture absorption of substrate 11.<br>
Since it is necessary for protective layer 17 to allow light irradiated onto the optical<br>
15 disk to penetrate to recording layer 13, it is preferably a resin film having high optical<br>
transmittance. In addition, preferable examples of resin films include polyolefin films<br>
and biodegradable resin films in consideration of minimal effects on the environment<br>
during disposal.<br>
The same films used for the aformatioined recording layer base material 31 can<br>
20 be used for the polyolefin film and biodegradable resin film.<br>
The thickness of protective layer 17 is normally 0.03 to 1.0 mm, and preferably 0.1<br>
to 0.6 mm.<br>
Furthermore, protective layer 17 may be composed by directly coating a liquid<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin, electron beam-cured resin, and so forth onto recording layer 1 3 by<br>
25 spin coating without using a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 16 to be described later,<br><br>
16<br>
followed by the curing thereof,<br><pressure-sensitive adhesive layers><br>
Pressure-sensitive adhesive layers 12, 14 and 16 are for laminating each layer, and<br>
are layers composed of a pressure-sensitive adhesive. Acrylic pressure-sensitive<br>
5 adlvesives and other known pressure-sensitive adhesives can be used for the<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive.<br>
The amount of pressure-sensitive adhesive should be suitably determined<br>
according to the material of each layer to be laminated. It is preferable that<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive layer 12 laminated between substrate 11 and recording layer<br>
10 13 have a smooth surface on the side of recording layer 13.<br><release layers><br>
As shown in FIG 5, an optical disk of the present invention may fee an optical disk<br>
20 in which release layers 18 and 19 are provided between substrate 11 and recording<br>
layer 13 and between substrate 11 and printing layer 15 for separation of each layer<br>
15 during disposal.<br>
Release layers 18 and 19 are preferably made of materials having low levels of<br>
surface activity, examples of which include polyolefins such as polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene.<br>
The thickness of release layers 18 and 19 is normally 5mm to 1 mm.<br>
20               <optical disk production proccss><br>
The following provides an explanation of a process for producing an optical disk<br>
of the present invention.<br>
An optical disk production process of the present invention is a process for<br>
producing an optical disk consisting of producing a printing layer, substrate, recording<br>
25 layer and protective layer separately with each sheet-like member wound as shown in<br><br>
17<br>
FIG- 6, coatining pressure-sensitive adhesives in a predetermined order in the final step,<br>
and then pressing and laminating them together to obtain the desired layer composition<br>
followed by punching out into the shape of a disk.<br>
The following provides an explanation of an example of a production process of<br>
5 optical disK 20 having the layer composition shown in FIG 5.<br>
A printing sheet is fabricated in. advance by printing onto printing base material 21<br>
(printing sheet fabrication step), release layers 18 and 19 are formed on both sides of a<br>
substrate sheet composed of a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin (release layer<br>
formation step), and a recording layer sheet is fabricated by forming tracks on recording<br>
10 layer base material 31 (41 or 51) (recording layer sheet fabrication step). Next, a<br>
printing layer 15 composed of the printing sheet is provided on substrate 11 composed of<br>
a biodegradable resin of polyolefin resin by laminating the substrate sheet and the<br>
aforementioned printing sheet (printing sheet lamination step), recording layer 13<br>
composed, af the printing layer sheet is provided on substrate 11 composed of a<br>
15 biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin by laminating the substrate sheet and the<br>
aforementioned recording layer sheet (recording layer sheet lamination step), and<br>
protective layer 17 composed of a protective film is provided on recording layer 13 by<br>
laminating a protective film on recording layer 13 (protective film lamination step) to<br>
form an optical disk roll having the desired layer composition followed by punching out<br>
20 said roll into the shape of disks to produce optical disk 20,<br><printing sheet fabrication step><br>
A printing sheet is fabricated by carrying out printing by printing ink 22 on<br>
printing base material 21 according to the step shown in FIG. 7A followed by winding<br>
onto a roller. At this time, positioning patterns are printed onto the printing sheet as<br>
25 shown in FIG. 6.<br><br>
18<br>
Examples of printing methods include offset printing, gravure printing, relief<br>
printing, screen printings ink jet printing and electrophotography. Offset printing or<br>
gravure printing is particularly preferable in the case of full-color printing having<br>
intermediate gradations since these methods allow the obtaining of high-deflnition<br>
5 images. In addition, ink jet printing or electrophotography is preferable in the case of<br>
imparting variable imformation that differs for each disk.<br><release layer formation step><br>
Release layers 18 and 19 are formed in advance on the substrate sheet serving as<br>
substrate 11 by molten extrusion coating of a polyotefin such as polyethylene onto both<br>
10 of its sides according to the step shown in FIG 7{b). The substrate sheet on which<br>
release layers 18 and 19 are formed is wound into the shape of a roll.<br><recording layer sheet fabrication step><br>
A recording layer sheet is fabricated by forming tracks on recording layer base<br>
material 31 (41 or 51), forming various layers respectively corresponding to a<br>
15 playback-only type, write-once type or rewritable type, and winding into the shape of a<br>
roll according to the step shown in FIG 7(c). At this time, positioning patterns<br>
(surface irregularities and so forth) are formed in the recording layer sheet as shown in<br>
FIG 6.<br>
(Play back-Only  Type)<br>
20               First, an ultraviolet-cured resin is coated onto recording layer base material 31, and<br>
a transfer mold having surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information pits<br>
is pressed against its surface to transfer the surface irregularities to the surface of the<br>
ultraviolet-cured resin (embossing processing). Next, the ultraviolet-cured resin is<br>
cured by irradiating with ultraviolet light to form information pit forming layer 32- At<br>
25 this time, by using a transfer mold having a diffraction grating pattern or hologram<br><br>
19<br>
pattern in addition to the surface irregularities corresponding to tracks and information<br>
pits for the transfer mold, an anti-theft or other pattern can also be formed on information<br>
pit forming layer 32,<br>
Next, light reflecting layer 33 composed of a metal thin film is formed on<br>
5 information pit forming layer 32 by vacuum deposition or sputtering.<br>
(Write-Once Type)<br>
The formation of information track forming layer 42 and light reflecting layer 43 is<br>
carried out in the same manner as information pit forming layer 32 and light reflecting<br>
layer 33 of the playback-only type. However, a transfer mold that docs not have surface<br>
10 irregularities corresponding to information pits is used for the transfer mold.<br>
Next, an organic pigment is coated onto light reflecting layer 43 to form<br>
information pit recording layer 44 composed of an organic pigment, colored film.<br>
Examples of coating methods include gravure coating, microgravure coating, die coating,<br>
comma coating, air knife coating and roll coating.<br>
15               (Rewritable Type)<br>
The formation of information track forming layer 52 and light reflecting layer 53 is<br>
carried out in the same manner as the write-once type.<br>
Next, SiO2 film 61, GeSbTe film 62, SiO2 film 63, GeSbTe film 64 and SiO2 film<br>
65 are sequentially formed on light reflecting layer 53 by sputtering or vacuum<br>
20 deposition,<br><lamination steps><br>
As shown in FIG 8, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is first coated on the printed side<br>
of a printing sheet, and this is laminated with a substrate sheet<br>
Next, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is coated onto a recording layer sheet and this<br>
25 is laminated onto the other side of the substrate sheet to which the printing sheet has been<br><br>
20<br>
laminated. At this time, the printing sheet and recording layer sheet are positioned by<br>
reading the positioning patterns on the printing sheet and the positioning patterns on the<br>
recording layer sheet with a position reading sensor and so forth.<br>
Next, a pressure-sensitive adhesive is coated onto a protective sheet, and this is<br>
5 laminated onto recording layer 13 on the substrate sheet to form an optical disk roll.<br><punching step><br>
Next, the optical disk-shaped processed portions of the roll are synchronized with a<br>
disk-shaped cutting blade by reading the positioning patterns with a sampling position<br>
reading sensor, and the roll is punched out in the shape of disks with the disk-shaped<br>
10 cutting blade to obtain optical disks.<br>
Optical disks obtained in this manner can be deformed depending on the material<br>
of each layer. Accordingly, in order to ensure smoothness, a step may be inserted in<br>
which warping of the roll is removed by heating the optical disks from both sides with a<br>
flat heating plate,<br>
15               In an optical disk of the present invention as has been explained above, since a<br>
substrate composed of a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin is used for substrate 11, it<br>
can be disposed of easily by incineration or burying underground, and there is only a<br>
minimal effect on the environment at that time. In addition, in an optical disk of the<br>
present invention, since a substrate composed of a biodegradable resin or polyolefin resin<br>
20 is used for substrate 11, the optical disk has the required strength for use as an optical<br>
disk.<br>
In addition, since printing layer 12 is additionally provided on the side of substrate<br>
11 opposite from the side on which recording layer 13 is provided, both sides of substrate<br>
11 are covered, thereby making it possible ro suppress water absorption and moisture<br>
25 absorption by substrate 11, as well as Suppress warping and other deformation of the<br><br>
21<br>
optical disk.<br>
Moreover, since recording layer 13 has a recording layer base material 31 (41 or<br>
51) composed of a non-hydrophilic film, water absorption and moisture absorption by<br>
substrate 11 can be further suppressed, and warping and other deformation of the optical<br>
5 disk, can be further suppressed.<br>
In addition, since printing layer 15 has a printing base material 21 composed of a<br>
non-hydrophilIc film, water absorption and moisture absorption by substrate 11 can be<br>
further suppressed, thereby making it possible to further suppress warping and other<br>
deformation of the optical disk.<br>
10              A similar action Is demonstrated even if recording layer 13 is provided on both<br>
sides of substrate 11.<br>
In addition, since recording layer 13 additionally has a protective layer 17 that<br>
protects recording layer 13,  together with preventing recording layer 13 from being<br>
damaged, water absorption and moisture absorption by substrate 11 can be farther<br>
15 suppressed, thereby making it possible to further suppress warping and other deformation<br>
of the optical disk.<br>
In addition, since release layers 18 and 19 are provided between substrate 11 and<br>
recording layer 13 and between substrate 11 and printing layer 15, substrate 11, recording<br>
layer 13 and printing layer 15 can be separated at the time of disposal and disposed of<br>
20 separately, thereby enabling disposal corresponding to the material of each layer and<br>
making it possible for further reduce the effects on the environment.<br>
In addition, in manufacturing method of an optical disk of the present invention,<br>
since substrate 11recording layer 13, printing layer 15 and protective layer 17 are<br>
formed by fabricating their corresponding sheets in advance followed by laminating<br>
25 those sheets, differing from coating by spin coating and so forth, there is less material<br><br>
22<br>
waste, and differing from the case of preliminarily laminating each layer that composes<br>
printing layer 13, recording layer 15 and protective layer 17 on a substrate in order, an<br>
optical disk having little warping of substrate 11 can be produced inexpensively without<br>
being subjected to stress caused by differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion.<br>
5               In addition, since a method is employed in which priming is carried out in advance<br>
on printing base material 21 to fabricate a printing sheet followed by laminating this onto<br>
substrate 11,  high-definition printing can be carried out, and highly detailed images can<br>
be obtained inexpensively. In addition, serial numbers and other variable information<br>
that differs for each disk can be printed onto an optical disk in the aforementioned<br>
1 0 printing sheet fabrication step.<br>
Furthermore, an optical disk of the present invention is not limited to that<br>
described in the aforementioned embodiments, but rather the design and so forth may be<br>
altered within a range that does not deviate from the gist of the present invention.<br>
For example, an optical disk of the present invention is not limited to a disk shape,<br>
15 but may be rectangular or any other arbitrary shape provided the region where<br>
Information is recorded is circular,<br>
In addition, although a pressure-sensitive adhesive is used when laminating each<br>
layer in the aforementioned embodiments, an adhesive layer, adhesive material, or a<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive material in which a pressure-sensitive adhesive or adhesive<br>
20 has been formed into the shape of a sheet may also be used for the pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesive,<br>
