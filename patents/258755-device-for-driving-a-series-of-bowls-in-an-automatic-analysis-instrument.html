				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device for automatically analysing a liquid sample.<br>
The present invention concerns an improvement of an automatic analysis device able to be used, especially for determining the modification times of a medium in a physical state.<br>
This device is particularly, but not exclusively, applicable to determination of the blood coagulation time in accordance with a process according to which the blood sample is placed at the bottom of a bowl containing a ferromagnetic ball driven in a periodic movement under the effect of an external magnetic field. The modifications of the movements of the ferromagnetic ball (for example the amplitude and/or frequency variations), which are representative of changes of the physical state of the blood, are then detected with the aid of suitable means.<br>
This type of device is described in the patent EP 0 325 874 filed in the name of the Diagnostica Stago company.<br>
It includes a bowl distributor for sole usage, each bowl including a bent inward bottom constituting the rolling path of the ball, and a face opposite the bottom having an opening. Transversal edges of this opening extend two shoulders at a right angle with respect to the faces of the bowls. The bowls are placed side by side and fixed on a flexible support strip which seals off their openings but said bowls can be removed. The strip equipped with bowls can be wound onto a coil able to be engaged on an element provided in a storage and distribution compartment of the device. The bowls run off one by one into a detection station.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	Device for driving a series of bowls (C) joined together by a film (3) so as to form a strip (2) in an automatic analysis instrument (1), this device including at least one notched belt whose notches act on the bowls so as to ensure driving of the strip, the said bowls have an opening at the level of which two opposing shoulders (R1, R2) extends projecting towards the outside of the bowl, and having configurations to ensure at the same time said drive, a centering and an indexing of the bowls, the said shoulders (R1, R2) each having two oblique edges with respect to the longitudinal axis of the strip (2) so that the strip (2)/bowls unit has a rack function.<br>
2.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said film (PC, TR) is fixed to said shoulders and is able to be removed.<br>
3.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said shoulders (R1, R2) have the shape of an isosceles trapezium whose major base is integral with the bowl (C).<br>
4.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the lateral borders of the film (3) each have a serrated profile whose teeth are accentuated by the presence of the shoulders (R1, R2) of the bowls.<br>
5.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said belt is an endless belt (12) guided at each extremity by rollers (13, 14).<br>
6.	Device as claimed in claim 5, wherein at least one of the rollers is driven in rotation by a motor (M).<br>
7.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the notches of said belt are spaced by a distance equal to a multiple of the width of the bowls (C).<br>
8.	Device as claimed in claim 7, wherein said notches have an involute to a circle profile corresponding to a rack with a normal teeth shape.<br><br>
9.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said bowls (C) are fixed and are able to be removed.<br>
10.	Device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said bowls are guided by a rail (5).<br>
11.	Device   as   claimed  in  claim   10,  wherein  said  rail   (5)  has   a  U-shaped  cross section whose two vertical wings are extended at a right angle by two shoulders<br>
(R3, R4).<br>
12.	Device as claimed in claim 10 and 11, wherein the shoulders (R1, R2) of the bowl (C) rest on the shoulders (R3, R4) of the rail (5).</td>
