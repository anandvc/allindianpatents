				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates, in general, to wireless technologies. Further, this invention relates to Mobility and Handover between heterogeneous wireless networks. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system for providing mobility between EUMTS and UMTS access systems.<br>
The scope of the invention also covers the case when the UE is not capable of accessing both the EUMTS and UMTS access systems simultaneously.<br>
This invention provides a system and method to perform Mobility between the access systems with optimized authentication procedure using security context transfer between the access systems and also minimize the data loss by buffering the data during the handover.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The radio access network (RAN), system architecture (SA) and the core terminal (CT) working groups of the third generation partnership project (3GPP) aim to develop an enhanced UTRAN (E-UTRAN) architecture for next generation wireless systems. The E-UTRAN system is also called as the system architecture evolution/ long-term evolution (SAE/LTE system). The enhanced UTRAN system is also called as E-UMTS access system. The E-UTRAN system is required to co-exist with the current second (2G) and third generation (3G) wireless systems, and in particular, support handovers between the existing systems and the newly evolved E-UTRAN system, specified in the 3GPP TR 23.882.<br>
The E-UTRAN system is an evolution of the 3GPP UTRAN system, in which the main entities are the user equipment (UE), the enhanced Node B (ENB) and the enhanced GGSN (EGGSN), as shown in the Figure 1. The ENB of the EUMTS system is expected to have the features of the Node B and the radio network controller (RNC) of the legacy UTRAN system. The EGGSN is expected to have the<br><br>
functionalities of the SGSN and the GGSN of the legacy UTRAN systems.<br>
The 3GPP TR 23.882 also specifies an architecture for integration of 3GPP LTE/SAE and other 3GPP and Non 3GPP access systems as shown in Figure 2.The entities in Figure 2 are as follows:<br>
•	The GERAN consists of the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BSC).<br>
•	The UTRAN consists of the Node B and the Radio Network Controller (RNC).<br>
•	The Evolved RAN is the Enhanced Node B (ENB).<br>
•	The Evolved Core Network is the Enhanced GGSN (EGGSN) and the Inter AS MM. The EGGSN can also be split into two nodes called mobility management entity (MME) and user plane entity (UPE). The MME and UPE can be combined into a single entity or can exist as two separate entities in the network.<br>
•	The Inter Access System Mobility Manager (Inter AS MM) acts as the user plane (UP) IP gateway for Inter RAT handover. It may have the functions of a Mobile IP Home Agent (MIP HA). To all the access networks, the Inter AS MM behaves like an external IP node. The Inter AS Mobility manager can also be called as Inter AS Anchor or SAE anchor. It is possible that GGSN be co-located with the entity or exists as a separate entity in the network.<br>
•	The WLAN 3GPP IP access depicts a scenario 3 Inter worked WLAN (l-WLAN).<br>
•	The Home Subscription Server (HSS) consists of the Home Location Register (HLR) and the Authentication Center (AuC).<br>
•	The Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) specifies the allowed quality-of-service (QoS) for the users as well as the charging policies for the users.<br>
The reference points in Figure 2 are as follows:<br><br>
•	The Gb reference point exists between the SGSN and the BSC of the GERAN. The lu reference point exists between the SGSN and the RNC of the UTRAN.<br>
•	The S1 reference point exists between the ENB and EGGSN<br>
•	The S2 reference point exists between the Inter AS Anchor and the Non 3GPP access systems<br>
•	The S3 reference point exists between the SGSN and MME<br>
•	The S4 reference point is between the SGSN and GGSN or between SGSN and Inter AS Anchor (if co-located with GGSN) and is the Gn interface<br>
•	The S5 interface exists between the EGGSN and the Inter AS Anchor<br>
•	The S6 interface exists between the Evolved packet core and the HSS<br>
•	The S7 interface exists between the Evolved packet core and the PCRF. It is an emhanced Rx, Gx interface<br>
•	The SGi reference point between the Inter AS MM and external PDN.<br>
Currently there is no efficient mechanism specified to provide handover between the EUMTS and the UMTS access systems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for supporting mobility between the EUMTS access system and the UMTS access system and optionally uses MIP protocol to support the mobility.<br>
The method of the invention comprises of mechanisms to move between the EUMTS access system and the l-WLAN access system when the UE have the capability of simultaneous access and also when the UE does not have capability to access simultaneously.<br>
The invention is operated as detailed below:<br>
Mechanism 1: Using GTP-c between the SGSN and the EGGSN<br>
In this mechanism, we present a procedure for handover between the EUMTS and UMTS access systems when the SGSN can communicate with the EGGSN using the GTP-c protocol or alternatively any using any other tunneling protocol. In this<br><br>
mechanism, the functions performed by the various network entities are as follows:<br>
•	The SGSN of the legacy core network performs the authentication of the UE.<br>
•	The GGSN acts as the IP gateway in the UMTS network and allocates/assigns IP address to the UE when the UE is served by the UMTS network.<br>
•	The authentication in the EUMTS network is performed by the EGGSN. The EGGSN also acts as the IP gateway to the EUMTS network and allocates/assigns IP address to the UE when the UE is served by the EUMTS network.<br>
•	The ENB of the EUMTS network can be capable of converting the RRC protocol messages of the EUMTS network to the RRC messages of the UMTS network and vice-versa.<br>
Handover from the EUMTS to the UMTS access system<br>
The optimization of the authentication procedure during the handover can be performed by making the SGSN obtain the UE security from the EGGSN. In this mechanism we consider an interface between the SGSN and the EGGSN that uses the GTP-c or any other tunneling protocol.<br>
For lossless handover, we propose buffering of the packets destined to the UE at the EGGSN during the handover. The GGSN needs to know the EGGSN IP address to obtain the packets and forward then to the UE after the handover. The EGGSN IP address can be obtained in any one of the following ways<br>
•	The UE can mention the old IP address and RAI in the PDP context activation procedure, using which the GGSN can resolve the EGGSN IP address<br>
•	The HSS can inform the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN<br>
•	The GGSN can contact the HSS during the PDP context activation procedure and obtain the EGGSN IP address<br><br>
The procedure for EUMTS to UMTS handover is explained below.<br>
•	The EGGSN takes the decision to handover the UE based on the signal strength measurements. The HO command is given to the UE, with the Cell ID of the UMTS network to which to handover to. The EGGSN also simultaneously starts buffering packets.<br>
•	The UE attaches to the given NodeB. After the L2 attach, UE sends the first L3 message to the SGSN. On receipt of the RAU from the UE, the SGSN can obtain the EGGSN address in any one of the following ways:<br>
1.	Using the old IP address of the UE (if included in the RAU)<br>
2.	Through interaction with HSS<br>
3.	Through GGSN  which contacts  HSS during  the  PDP context activation.<br><br>
•	User context is now transferred from EGGSN using GTP-C mechanism or through any other control plane protocol. The user context contains the information which can be used for authentication optimization.<br>
•	When the UE requests for PDP context, through PDP context Request procedure, the GGSN obtains the IP address of the EGGSN in any one of the following ways:<br>
1.	SGSN forwards the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN<br>
2.	EGGSN IP address can be obtained by contacting the HSS.<br>
•	GGSN forms a tunnel with EGGSN through which the buffered packets are forwarded. Simultaneously, PDP context is also completed. The packets from the EGGSN are now forwarded through appropriate PDP contexts.<br>
•	After the formation of the PDP context, MIP Based mobility mechanism can be used for completing the mobility. After MIP procedures have been completed, the HO Complete message is sent, and the resources at the EUMTS network are released.<br>
An illustrative example of the handover procedure from EUMTS access system to the UMTS access system in this scenario is depicted in Figure 3. The description of the handover procedure is provided below.<br><br>
UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the EUMTS network.<br>
If EGGSN finds that UE measurement is below the threshold or EGGSN decides by any other mean that EUMTS RAT cannot be continued, then EGGSN/ENB can request the UE to start scanning other RATs or alternatively by L2 messaging or by some other means, the UE decides that the EUMTS cannot be continued and starts scanning the other RATs.<br>
. UE scans UMTS RATs and sends the measurement reports to the EGGSN. The measurement report message contains the received signal strength indication (RSSI), cell ID, RAT type (UMTS)<br>
The EGSSN issues a Handover (HO) command signal to the UE and starts buffering the packets destined for the UE. The EGGSN can optionally before sending the HO command, can prepare the target SGSN for the handover by sending a HO request containing the cell ID. The SGSN, in turn, can resolve the RNC ID from the cell ID and prepare the RNC for the impending handover to reserve radio resources.<br>
On receiving the HO Command, the UE performs an L2 establishment with the target Node B of the UMTS network. In the initial L3 message, the UE mentions the pervious routing area identity (RAI).<br>
The SGSN makes use of this information and obtains the UE security context (i. e., the ciphering key (CK), the integrity key (IK), the key set identifier (KSI)) from the EGGSN.<br>
The UE then activates the PDP context with the SGSN of the UMTS network. The GGSN resolves the EGGSN IP address. The GGSN shall also maintain a mapping of the old IP address of the UE to the new IP address which is allocated during PDP context activation to the UE.<br><br>
The GGSN establishes a tunnel with the EGGSN and obtains the packets destined to the UE that were buffered at the EGGSN as mentioned in step 4 above.<br>
The SGSN then sends a PDP context activation complete message and forwards the buffered packets (obtained from the EGGSN) to the UE.<br>
The SGSN then sends a trigger to the EGGSN to release the radio resources that were used/reserved for the UE. In order to avoid ping pong effect, the EGGSN could start a timer and release the resources after expiry of the timer.<br>
The UE performs the MIP like binding update or MIP binding update with the Home Agent (HA) and the correspondent node (CN).<br>
On obtaining the binding acknowledgement (BACK) from the CN, the UE sends a HO complete message to the serving SGSN.<br>
The SGSN, in turn, intimates the EGGSN about the hand off completion by sending a HO confirm command. This command is a trigger for the EGGSN to release the IP address allocated to the UE in case there were no TCP sessions incident on the UE.<br>
In case the UE does not have any incident TCP sessions and has IMS sessions incident on it, then the UE can avoid the MIP registration procedure and can perform a SIP update procedure.<br>
Handover from the UMTS to the EUMTS access system<br>
The optimization of the authentication procedure during the handover can be<br><br>
performed by making the EGGSN obtain the UE security from the SGSN. In this mechanism we consider an interface between the SGSN and the EGGSN that uses the GTP-c or any other tunneling protocol.<br>
For lossless handover, we propose buffering of the packets destined to the UE at the GGSN during the handover. The EGGSN needs to know the GGSN IP address to obtain the packets and forward then to the UE after the handover. The GGSN IP address can be obtained in any one of the following ways<br>
•	The SGSN can forward the GGSN IP address during the HO preparation phase<br>
•	The UE can mention the old IP address and RAI in the user plane (UP) set up procedure, using which the EGGSN can resolve the GGSN IP address<br>
•	The HSS can inform the GGSN IP address to the EGGSN<br>
•	The EGGSN can contact the HSS during the UP set up procedure and obtain the GGSN IP address<br>
The procedure for UMTS to EUMTS handover is explained below.<br>
•	The SGSN takes the decision to handover the UE based on the signal strength measurements. The HO command is given to the UE, with the Cell ID of the EUMTS network to which to handover to. The SGSN also triggers the GGSN to buffer the packets destined to the UE. The GGSN starts buffering packets.<br>
•	The UE attaches to the given ENB. After the L2 attach, UE sends the first L3 message to the EGGSN, which could be the Routing Area Update (RAU) or any other equivalent message. On receipt of the RAU from the UE, the EGGSN can obtain the GGSN address in any one of the following ways:<br>
1.	Using the old IP address of the UE (if included in the RAU)<br>
2.	Through interaction with HSS<br>
•	User context is now transferred from SGSN to the EGGSN using GTP-C mechanism or through any other control plane protocol. The user context contains the information which can be used for authentication optimization.<br>
•	When the UE requests for User plane set up to activate the flows, EGGSN<br><br>
forms a tunnel with GGSN through which the buffered packets are forwarded. Simultaneously, UP set up is also completed. The packets from the EGGSN are now forwarded through appropriate flows. •   MIP Based mobility mechanism can be used for completing the mobility. After MIP procedures have been completed, the HO Complete message is sent, and the resources at the UMTS network are released.<br>
An illustrative example of the handover procedure from UMTS access system to the EUMTS access system in this scenario is depicted in Figure 4. The description of the handover procedure is provided below:<br>
The UE sends the UMTS measurement reports to the SGSN.<br>
Based on the signal strength of UMTS or by other means, the SGSN requests the UE to scan the other RATs. UE start scanning the other RAT.<br>
UE sends the EUMTS measurement reports to the SGSN and can request the SGSN for a handover to the EUMTS network or the SGSN can decide that the UE attach with the EUMTS AS.<br>
The SGSN can optionally prepare the EGGSN for the impending handoff by sending a handoff request and the EGGSN, in turn, can prepare the target ENB.<br>
On reserving the required radio and network resources, the EGGSN sends an HO accept message to the SGSN.<br>
Upon receiving HO accept from the EGGSN, the SGSN issues a HO command to the UE and also in parallel, triggers the GGSN to buffer the packets destined to the UE. The GGSN then starts buffering the UE packets.<br><br>
The UE establish L2/RRC connection with the EUMTS network. Then the UE send the RAU message or alternatively any initial L3 message after the L2 connection, including the HO preparation message containing the old RAI.<br>
The EGGSN obtains the AV's from the SGSN. EGGSN updates the HSS about the new location of the UE.<br>
The EGGSN allocates/assigns a new IP address to the UE while accepting the RA update<br>
The UE performs a UP set up procedure in the EUTRAN network to activate the flows. The EGGSN maintains the mapping between the old IP address of the UE (in the UMTS domain) and the new IP address allocated by the EGGSN in the EUMTS domain.<br>
The EGGSN obtains the GGSN IP address from the HSS.<br>
The EGGSN establishes an IP Sec tunnel (or any other secure tunnel) with the GGSN and obtains the packets destined to the UE that were buffered at the GGSN as mentioned in step 6<br>
.The UE may do MIP based route optimization procedure with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
.The UE can intimate the release of IP to the EGGSN in the HO complete message.<br>
The EGGSN relays the HO complete message to the GGSN, which, in turn, shall release the old IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no TCP sessions incident on the UE.<br><br>
If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br>
Mechanism 2: Using AAA proxy functionality at the EGGSN and the SGSN<br>
In this mechanism we describe a method for handover between EUMTS and UMTS access systems when the SGSN and the EGGSN has functionalities of the AAA proxy. In other words, we consider a scenario where the authentication in the EUMTS network is AAA based. We now describe the procedure for optimization of the authentication procedure during handover. It is noted that in this scenario, there is no interface between the SGSN and the EGGSN. The functions of the various network entities in this scenario are as follows:<br>
•	The SGSN of the legacy core network acts as an AAA proxy and obtains the UE security context from the AAA server.<br>
•	The GGSN acts as the IP gateway in the UMTS network and allocates IP address to the UE when the UE is served by the UMTS network.<br>
•	The EGGSN of the EUMTS network acts as an AAA proxy for the UE served by the EUMTS network. The EGGSN also acts as the IP gateway to the EUMTS network and allocates IP address to the UE when the UE is served by the EUMTS network.<br>
•	The ENB of the EUMTS network can be capable of converting the RRC protocol messages of the EUMTS to the RRC messages of the UMTS network and vice-versa.<br>
Handover from the EUMTS to the UMTS Access System<br>
For lossless handover, we propose buffering of the packets destined to the UE at the EGGSN during the handover. The GGSN needs to know the EGGSN IP<br><br>
address to obtain the packets and forward then to the UE after the handover. The EGGSN IP address can be obtained in any one of the following ways<br>
•	The AAA server can forward the EGGSN IP address to the SGSN when the SGSN retrieves security context and the SGSN can forward the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN during the PDP context creation procedure<br>
•	The UE can mention the old IP address and RAI in the PDP context activation procedure, using which the GGSN can resolve the EGGSN IP address<br>
•	The HSS can inform the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN<br>
•	The GGSN can contact the HSS during the PDP context activation procedure and obtain the EGGSN IP address<br>
The procedure for EUMTS to UMTS handover is explained below.<br>
•	The EGGSN takes the decision to handover the UE based on the signal strength measurements. The HO command is given to the UE, with the Cell ID of the UMTS network to which to handover to. The EGGSN also simultaneously starts buffering packets.<br>
•	The UE attaches to the given NodeB. After the L2 attach, UE sends the first L3 message to the SGSN. On receipt of the RAU from the UE, the SGSN resolves the AAA server ID.<br>
•	The SGSN can obtain the EGGSN address in any one of the following ways:<br>
1.	Using the old IP address of the UE (if included in the RAU)<br>
2.	Through interaction with HSS<br>
3.	Through  GGSN which  contacts  HSS during  the  PDP context activation.<br>
4.	Through the AAA server while obtaining the UE security context information<br><br>
•	User context is now obtained from AAA server through any control plane protocol. The user context contains the information which can be used for authentication optimization.<br>
•	When the UE requests for PDP context, through PDP context Request procedure, the GGSN obtains the IP address of the EGGSN in any one of<br><br>
the following ways:<br>
1.	SGSN forwards the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN<br>
2.	EGGSN IP address can be obtained by contacting the HSS.<br>
•	GGSN forms a tunnel with EGGSN through which the buffered packets are forwarded. Simultaneously, PDP context is also completed. The packets from the EGGSN are now forwarded through appropriate PDP contexts.<br>
•	After the formation of the PDP context, MIP Based mobility mechanism can be used for completing the mobility. After MIP procedures have been completed, the HO Complete message is sent, and the resources at the EUMTS network are released.<br>
An illustrative example of the handover procedure from EUMTS access system to the UMTS access system in this scenario is depicted in Figure 5. The description of the handover procedure is provided below.<br>
UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the ENB/EGGSN.<br>
The EGGSN, on finding the EUMTS measurements unsatisfactory, can request the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively by L2 or any other means the UE can decide that the EUMTS cannot be continued and starts scanning other RATs.<br>
The UE sends measurements reports of UMTS network.<br>
The EGGSN decides the target Node B and issues a HO command. Alternatively, the UE could specify the preferred target Node B and the EGGSN could issue HO command accepting the UE preferred target Node B. The EGGSN also starts buffering the UE packets before issuing the HO command.<br>
The UE performs L2 attach procedure with the target UMTS network and the RAU with the corresponding SGSN. In the RAU, the UE mentions the<br><br>
old RAI. The SGSN resolves the home AAA server identity using the old RAI and contacts the home AAA server to obtain the authentication vectors. The AAA also can mention the EGGSN IP address to the SGSN<br>
Upon PDP context activation request from the UE, the SGSN chooses an appropriate GGSN and mentions the EGGSN IP address to the GGSN. This enables the GGSN to establish an IP Sec tunnel with the EGGSN and retrieve the buffered packets for the UE. The GGSN also maintains a mapping between the old IP address of the UE and the newly allocated IP address in the UMTS domain.<br>
The GGSN establishes an IP Sec or any other secure tunnel with the EGGSN and obtains the buffered packets the EGGSN destined to the UE.<br>
The buffered packets are delivered to the UE as part of completion of the PDP context activation procedure.<br>
The SGSN triggers the EGGSN to release the resources used/reserved for the UE. To avoid ping pong effect a timer can be added to the EGGSN and release of resources can be made after expiry of the timer.<br>
. The UE performs the MIP binding update with the CN, if CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered to be disadvantage.<br>
.After successful MIP update procedure, the UE sends a HO complete message to the SGSN.<br>
.The SGSN, in turn, forwards the message to the EGGSN triggering the release of the old IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no active TCP sessions incident on the UE using the old IP address.<br>
. If no active TCP connections were present, then the UE can do SIP based<br><br>
terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br>

An illustrative example of the handover procedure from UMTS access system to the EUMTS access system for Mechanism 2 is depicted in Figure 6. The description of the handover procedure is provided below.<br>
UE sends periodic or event based measurements to the SGSN.<br>
If the SGSN finds the UMTS measurements unsatisfactory, it requests the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively, by L2 or any other means, the UE decides that the UMTS measurements are unsatisfactory and scans other RATs.<br>
The UE sends the EUMTS measurement report to the SGSN specifying the ENB id. The SGSN decides the target ENB. Optionally, the UE can specify a preferred target ENB and the SGSN could accept the UE preferred ENB.<br>
On deciding the target ENB, the SGSN can optionally send a HO request to the AAA server.<br>
The AAA server, in turn, can assign a stateful IP address to the UE in the EUMTS network and include the IP address in the HO accept message.<br><br>
Optionally, the AAA server could forward the HO request to the EGGSN enabling the EGGSN and ENB reserve resources for the UE as a preparation phase.<br>
The SGSN then issues a HO command to the UE and also in parallel intimates the GGSN to buffer the packets destined for the UE.<br>

Handover between the EUMTS and UMTS Access Systems for the SAE/LTE Architecture<br>
We now present the handover procedure between the EUMTS and UMTS access systems for the SAE/LTE architecture. We consider two scenarios:<br>
a)	The Inter AS MM acts analogous to the mobile IP home agent for the UE and tunnels downlink packets to the UE from the CN as well as uplink packets from the UE to the CN and there exists a trust relation between the Inter AS MM and all the access systems.<br>
b)	The Inter AS MM only assists in signaling and the IP gateways of the respective access systems act as the Home Agents for the UE.<br>
Mechanism 3: Handover between the EUMTS and UMTS Access Systems for the SAE/LTE Architecture when Inter AS MM is analogous to the MIP Home<br><br>
Agent<br>
We first present the handover procedure between the EUMTS and UMTS access systems for the SAE/LTE architecture when the Inter AS MM acts like the HA for the UE. As mentioned earlier, the Inter AS MM also has a trust relation with the core network of each of the access systems. Further, the Inter AS MM is also considered to be capable of the following functions:<br>
•	Mapping the UMTS cell ID reported by the UE to the appropriate SGSN of the UMTS network.<br>
•	Mapping the cell ID of the EUMTS network to the appropriate EGGSN of the EUMTS network.<br>
•	Resolving the appropriate GGSN for the UE based on the APN specified by the UE.<br>
We also consider the following up-gradations to the UMTS network<br>
•	The GGSN is up-graded and is considered capable of issuing a HO Initiate command to the SGSN over GTP-c.<br>
•	The SGSN is upgraded to understand the HO initiate command issued by the GGSN as well as to send an HO Response command in response to the HO Initiate Command<br>
•	The SGSN is also upgraded to send an Inter RAT HO command to the GGSN. The GGSN is upgraded to understand the above command and relay it to the Inter AS MM.<br>
•	The SGSN is also considered to be upgraded to be capable of passing UE security context information to the Inter AS MM through the GGSN and obtain the security context information from the Inter AS MM through the GGSN.<br>
Handover from the EUMTS to the UMTS access system<br>
We first present the handover procedure from the EUMTS to the UMTS access<br><br>
system. The handover procedure for the EUMTS to UMTS AS handover is as explained below:<br>
■	The EGGSN takes the handover decision based on the UE measurement reports and issues an Inter RAT HO command to the Inter AS MM including the UMTS cell ID, the User context, IMSI and APN.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM resolves the appropriate SGSN from the UMTS cell ID and the GGSN from the APN and forwards an HO Initiate command to the GGSN including the SGSN ID.<br>
■	The GGSN forwards the command to the SGSN and the SGSN can optionally prepare the RNC for the HO and radio and network resources can be reserved. After reserving radio resources, the SGSN sends an HO Response to the GGSN accepting the HO and the GGSN forwards this command to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM forwards the HO Response to the EGGSN, which sends an HO command and starts buffering the packets destined for the UE. In case Route Optimization (RO) is not supported, the Inter AS MM buffers the packets destined to the UE before forwarding the HO Response to the EGGSN.<br>
■	The UE performs an L2 attach with the RNC and an RAU with the SGSN. Upon receiving the RAU message the SGSN requests the GGSN for the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the UE security context from the Inter AS MM. The UE security context contains information that enables optimization of the authentication procedure.<br>
■	Upon PDP context activation request from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO initiate command. If the SGSN chooses another GGSN then it needs to inform the Inter AS MM IP address to the GGSN. Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the GGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The HO complete message is relayed to the EGGSN to enable release of resources in the EUMTS network.<br>
■	The UE performs MIP update procedure with the Inter AS MM. This triggers<br><br>
Inter AS MM to obtain the buffered packets at the EGGSN destined to the UE and forward the packets to the GGSN. In case RO is not supported, then the Inter AS MM directly forwards the buffered packets destined to the UE, to the GGSN.<br>
An illustrative example of the handover flow diagram is depicted in Figure 7. The detailed procedure is as follows:<br>
The UE sends the EUMTS measurement reports to the EGGSN.<br>
Based on the signal strength of EUMTS the EGGSN requests the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively, by L2 or by other means, the UE start scanning the other RATs.<br>
The UE sends the measurement report of the UMTS AS to the EGGSN. This includes the UMTS RAN ID.<br>
The EGGSN could decide to handover the UE to the UMTS AS or alternatively, the UE could request an HO to the UMTS AS. In either case, the EGGSN sends an Inter RAT HO request to the Inter AS MM indicating the cell ID of the UMTS network, the UE security context, the APN and the IMSI.<br>
The Inter AS MM resolves the SGSN ID from the cell ID and the GGSN from the APN.<br>
The Inter AS MM sends an HO Initiate command to the appropriate GGSN.<br>
The GGSN relays the HO initiate command to the SGSN along with the IMSI.<br><br>
The SGSN can optionally prepare the RNC for the impending handover. However, this requires translation of EUMTS RRC containers to the UMTS RRC containers. This function can performed at the ENB of the EUMTS and the RRC containers can be included in the Inter RAT HO request sent to the Inter AS MM, which, in turn, relays it to the SGSN through the GGSN in the HO Initiate command.<br>
The RNC sends an HO response command accepting the handover.<br>
On obtaining the response from the RNC, the SGSN relays the HO Response command to the GGSN.<br>
The GGSN, in turn, relays the HO Response command to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the response to the EGGSN.<br>
Upon receiving the HO response, the EGGSN issues an HO command to the UE and starts buffering the UE packets. In case route optimization (RO) is not supported, then the buffering of packets is done at the Inter AS MM instep 12.<br>
The UE performs an L2 establishment with the UMTS RNC.<br>
The UE then performs an RA Update procedure with the SGSN. Based on the IMSI in the RAU message the SGSN sends a request to the GGSN to obtain the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the security context from the Inter AS MM and passes it to the SGSN.<br>
Upon PDP context activation from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO Initiate command for the UE.<br><br>
However, if the SGSN chooses any other GGSN, then it needs to intimate the GGSN of the IP address of the Inter AS MM.<br>
. Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the GGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
.The Inter AS MM relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>
.The HO complete message triggers the EGGSN and ENB to release the network and radio resources allocated to the UE. Optionally, to avoid ping-pong effect, there can be a timer at the EGGSN and the release of the network and radio resources can be made after the expiry of the timer. The HO complete message can also be a trigger for the EGGSN to release the IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no active TCP sessions.<br>
.The UE performs an MIP binding update with the Inter AS MM intimating the Inter AS MM of the new IP address. Also, if the CN supports MIP and tunnel over head is not considered a disadvantage then a BU is performed with the CN.<br>
. Upon receiving the BU, the Inter AS MM forwards the buffered packets to the GGSN.<br>
.In case RO is supported, then the Inter AS MM obtains the buffered packets from the EGGSN, changes the destination IP address to the new IP address of the UE, and forwards the packets to the GGSN.<br>
If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br><br>
Handover from the UMTS to the EUMTS Access System<br>
The handover procedure for the UMTS to EUMTS AS handover is as explained below:<br>
■	The SGSN takes the handover decision based on the UE measurement reports and issues an Inter RAT HO command to the Inter AS MM through the GGSN including the EUMTS cell ID, the User context, IMSI and UE flow information.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM resolves the appropriate EGGSN from the UMTS cell ID and the UE flow information and forwards an HO Initiate command to the EGGSN.<br>
■	The EGGSN can optionally prepare the ENB for the HO and radio and network resources can be reserved. After reserving radio resources, the EGGSN sends an HO Response to the Inter AS MM accepting the HO.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM forwards the HO Response to the GGSN, which forwards the HO response to the SGSN and starts buffering the packets destined to the UE. In case Route Optimization (RO) is not supported, the Inter AS MM buffers the packets destined to the UE before forwarding the HO Response to the GGSN.<br>
■	The SGSN sends an HO command to the UE.<br>
■	The UE performs an L2 attach with the ENB and an RAU or an equivalent initial L3 attach procedure with the EGGSN. Upon receiving the RAU message the EGGSN requests the Inter AS MM for the UE security context. The UE security context contains information that enables optimization of the authentication procedure.<br>
■	Upon successful completion of the UP establishment procedure, the EGGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The HO complete message is relayed to the GGSN and the GGSN relays the message to the SGSN to enable release of resources in the UMTS network.<br><br>
■ The UE performs MIP update procedure with the Inter AS MM. This triggers Inter AS MM to obtain the buffered packets at the GGSN destined to the UE and forward the packets to the EGGSN. In case RO is not supported, then the Inter AS MM directly forwards the buffered packets destined to the UE, to the EGGSN.<br>
An illustrative example of the message flows/sequence for the UMTS to EUMTS handover is illustrated in Figure 8: The detailed description is as given below<br>
The UE sends the UMTS measurement reports to the SGSN.<br>
Based on the signal strength of UMTS the SGSN requests the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively, by L2 or by other means, the UE start scanning the other RATs.<br>
The UE sends the EUMTS measurement reports to the SGSN.<br>
The SGSN decides to handover the UE to the EUMTS network or alternatively, the UE can request for handover to the EUMTS network. In either case, the SGSN sends an Inter RAT HO message to the GGSN including the UE security context, the EUMTS cell ID and the IMSI.<br>
The GGSN relays the Inter RAT HO message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM resolves the EGGSN ID from the cell ID. In case a single ENB can be connected to multiple EGGSN, the Inter AS MM can choose the EGGSN based on the flows incident on the UE.<br>
The Inter AS MM sends an HO Initiate message to the EGGSN including the IMSI of the UE.<br>
Optionally, the Inter RAT HO message from the SGSN can also contain<br><br>
RRC specific containers, which the Inter AS MM can include in the HO Initiate message. Upon receiving the HO Initiate message, the EGGSN can prepare the ENB for the HO and radio as well as network resources can be reserved for the UE.<br>
The ENB responds with an HO Response message accepting the handover.<br>
The HO Response message from the EGGSN is relayed to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the HO response message to the GGSN. If RO is not supported then the Inter AS MM also begins to buffer packets destined to the UE.<br>
.The GGSN, upon receiving the HO response, relays the message to the SGSN and starts buffering the packets destined to the UE in case RO is supported.<br>
.Upon receiving the HO Response from the GGSN, the SGSN issues an HO Command to the UE.<br>
The UE performs an L2 attach with the ENB.<br>
The UE performs an RAU or L3 attach with the EGGSN. From the IMSI obtained in the RAU, the EGGSN obtains the UE security context from the Inter AS MM.<br>
The UE performs the user plane (UP) set up procedure for activating the flows.<br>
After completion of the UP set up, the EGGSN sends an HO complete<br><br>
message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM, in turn, relays the HO complete message to the GGSN.<br>
The HO complete message is relayed to the SGSN by the GGSN. The SGSN deletes the PDP context and releases the radio resources. Optionally, to avoid ping-pong effect, a time out can be added to the SGSN to delete the PDP context and release the radio resources. The HO complete message can also be a trigger for the GGSN to release the IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no active TCP sessions.<br>
The UE performs an MIP update procedure with the Inter AS MM indicating the new IP address. If the CN supports MIP and tunneling overhead is not considered a disadvantage, then the UE also performs a BU with the CN.<br>
Upon completion of the MIP update procedure, the Inter AS MM obtains the buffered UE packets from the GGSN, changes the destination IP address to the new UE IP address.<br>
The Inter AS MM forwards the packets to the EGGSN. In case RO is not supported, then the Inter AS MM directly forwards the UE buffered packets to the EGGSN and step 21 does not exist.<br>
If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br>
Handover between the EUMTS and UMTS Access Systems for the SAE/LTE Architecture when Inter AS MM is used only for signaling and the IP gateway of the respective Access Systems act as Home Agents<br><br>
We now present the handover procedures between the EUMTS and UTRAN access systems for the scenarios in which the Inter AS MM does not behave like an HA but only assists in signaling. Also, in this case, we consider no trust relationship between the Inter AS MM and the core networks of the respective AS. However, the Inter AS MM is considered to be capable of the following functions:<br>
•	Resolving SGSN ID from the UMTS cell ID and the EGGSN ID from the EUMTS cell ID.<br>
•	Resolving GGSN from APN.<br>
•	Resolving PDG from W-APN.<br>
•	Mapping the IMSI to the EGGSN or GGSN that acts as HA for the UE.<br>
In this scenario also the UMTS network is considered to be upgraded as follows:<br>
•	The GGSN is up-graded and is considered capable of issuing a HO Initiate command to the SGSN over GTP-c.<br>
•	The SGSN is upgraded to understand the HO initiate command issued by the GGSN as well as to send an HO Response command in response to the HO Initiate Command<br>
•	The SGSN is also upgraded to send an Inter RAT HO command to the GGSN. The GGSN is upgraded to understand the above command and relay it to the Inter AS MM.<br>
•	The SGSN is also considered to be upgraded to be capable of passing UE security context information to the GGSN and obtain the security context information from the EGGSN through the GGSN.<br>
We present two cases in this scenario<br>
a)	The EUMTS network is the home network of the UE. In this case, the EGGSN acts as the Home Agent for the UE.<br>
b)	The UMTS network is the home network of the UE. In this case, the GGSN acts as the Home Agent for the UE.<br>
Mechanism 4: Handover between the EUMTS and UMTS Access Systems for<br><br>
the SAE/LTE Architecture when Inter AS MM is used only for signaling and EGGSN acts as the Home Agent<br>
We first present the handover mechanism when the EUMTS network is the home network of the UE and the EGGSN acts as the HA for the UE. Here, we first consider a UE moving from the EUMTS network to the UMTS network. From the UMTS network, we consider two more cases:<br>
(i) UE moves from UMTS network to an l-WLAN network<br>
(ii) UE moves from UMTS network back to the EUMTS network.<br>
Handover from the EUMTS to the UMTS access system<br>
The handover procedure for the EUMTS to UMTS handover when the EGGSN acts as the HA, is as explained below:<br>
■	The EGGSN takes the handover decision based on the UE measurement reports and issues an Inter RAT HO command to the Inter AS MM including the UMTS cell ID, IMSI and APN.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM resolves the appropriate SGSN from the UMTS cell ID and the GGSN from the APN and forwards an HO Initiate command to the GGSN including the SGSN ID and the EGGSN IP address.<br>
■	The GGSN forwards the command to the SGSN and the SGSN can optionally prepare the RNC for the HO and radio and network resources can be reserved. After reserving radio resources, the SGSN sends an HO Response to the GGSN accepting the HO and the GGSN forwards this command to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM forwards the HO Response to the EGGSN, which sends an HO command and starts buffering the packets destined for the UE.<br>
■	The UE performs an L2 attach with the RNC and an RAU with the SGSN. Upon receiving the RAU message the SGSN requests the GGSN for the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the UE security context from the EGGSN.  The  UE security context contains  information that enables<br><br>
optimization of the authentication procedure.<br>
■	Upon PDP context activation request from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO initiate command. In case the SGSN chooses another GGSN, then it needs to inform EGGSN IP address to the other GGSN. Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the GGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The HO complete message is relayed to the EGGSN to enable release of resources in the EUMTS network.<br>
■	The UE performs MIP update procedure with the EGGSN. This triggers the EGGSN to forward the buffered packets destined to the UE to the GGSN.<br>
An illustrative example for the message flow/sequence for the EUMTS to UMTS network handover when the EGGSN acts as the HA, is illustrated in Figure 9. The detailed description of the procedure is as follows:<br>
The UE sends the EUMTS measurement reports to the EGGSN.<br>
Based on the signal strength of EUMTS the EGGSN requests the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively, by L2 or by other means, the UE decides to start scanning the other RATs.<br>
UE sends the measurement report of the UMTS AS to the EGGSN.<br>
The EGGSN could decide to handover the UE to the UMTS AS or alternatively, the UE could request an HO to the UMTS AS. In either case, the EGGSN sends an Inter RAT HO request to the Inter AS MM indicating the cell ID of the UMTS network, the IMSI and the APN.<br>
The Inter AS MM resolves the SGSN ID from the cell ID and the GGSN from the APN.<br>
The Inter AS MM sends an HO Initiate command to the appropriate GGSN.<br><br>
The Inter AS MM also includes the EGGSN IP address in the HO Initiate.<br>
The GGSN relays the HO initiate command to the SGSN along with the IMSI.<br>
The SGSN can optionally prepare the RNC for the impending handover. However, this requires translation of EUMTS RRC containers to the UMTS RRC containers. This functions can performed at the ENB of the EUMTS and the RRC containers can be included in the Inter RAT HO request sent to the Inter AS MM, which, in turn, relays it to the SGSN through the GGSN in the HO Initiate command.<br>
. The RNC sends an HO response command to the SGSN accepting the HO.<br>
On obtaining the response form the RNC, the SGSN relays the HO Response command to the GGSN.<br>
The GGSN, in turn, relays it to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the response to the EGGSN.<br>
Upon receiving HO Response, the EGGSN issues an HO command to the UE and starts buffering the UE packets.<br>
The UE performs an L2 attach with the UMTS RNC.<br>
The UE performs an RAU procedure with the SGSN. Based on the IMSI in the RAU message the SGSN sends a request to the GGSN to obtain the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the security context from the EGGSN (since it obtains the EGGSN IP address from the Inter AS MM in the HO Initiate command) and passes it to the SGSN.<br><br>
Upon PDP context activation from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO Initiate command for the UE. However, if the SGSN chooses any other GGSN, then it needs to intimate the GGSN of the IP address of the EGGSN.<br>
Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the SGSN sends an HO complete message to the GGSN.<br>
The GGSN relays the HO complete command to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>
The HO complete message triggers the EGGSN and ENB to release the network and radio resources allocated to the UE. Optionally, to avoid ping-pong effect, there can be a timer at the EGGSN and the release of the network and radio resources can be made after the expiry of the timer. The HO complete message can also be a trigger for the EGGSN to release the IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no active TCP sessions.<br>
The UE performs an MIP binding update with the EGGSN intimating the EGGSN of the new IP address. Also, if the CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered a disadvantage then a BU is performed with the CN.<br>
Upon receiving the BU, the EGGSN forwards the buffered packets to the GGSN by changing the destination address in the IP packets to the new IP address of the UE.<br>
If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and<br><br>
can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br>

■	The Inter AS MM resolves the appropriate PDG from the W-APN and the UE flow information and forwards an HO Initiate command to the PDG including the GGSN IP address, WLAN ID and NAI.<br>
■	The PDG can optionally prepare the AP for the HO and radio and network resources can be reserved. After reserving radio resources, the PDG sends an HO Response to the Inter AS MM accepting the HO.<br>
■	The Inter AS MM forwards the HO Response to the GGSN and the EGGSN including the PDG IP address. The EGGSN starts buffering the packets destined to the UE. The GGSN forwards the HO response to the SGSN.<br>
■	The SGSN sends an HO command to the UE.<br>
■	The UE performs an L2 association with the AP and establishes an IP Sec tunnel with the PDG, which requests the GGSN for the UE security context. The UE security context contains information that enables optimization of the authentication procedure.<br>
■	Upon successful completion of the tunnel establishment procedure and UE flow activation, the PDG sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The HO complete message is relayed to the GGSN and the GGSN relays the message to the SGSN to enable release of resources in the UMTS network.<br><br>

.The SGSN deletes the PDP context and releases the radio resources.<br><br>
Optionally, to avoid ping-pong effect, a timer can be added at the SGSN and the deletion of the PDP context and release of the radio resources can be made after expiry of the timer. The HO complete also triggers the GGSN to release the tunnel established with the EGGSN. If a timer is used, then the expiry of the timer triggers release of the tunnel between the GGSN and the EGGSN.

■	The UE performs an L2 attach with the RNC and an RAU with the SGSN. Upon receiving the RAU message the SGSN requests the GGSN for the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the UE security context from the EGGSN. The UE security context contains information that enables optimization of the authentication procedure.<br>
■	Upon PDP context activation request from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO initiate command. Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the GGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
■	The HO complete message is relayed to the EGGSN to enable release of resources in the EUMTS network.<br>
■	The UE performs MIP updated-registration procedure with the GGSN. This triggers the GGSN to forward the buffered packets to the UE.<br>
An illustrative example of the message flow/sequence for the EUMTS network to UMTS network handover when the GGSN acts as the HA, is illustrated in Figure 14. The detailed description of the procedure is as follows<br>
The UE sends the EUMTS measurement reports to the EGGSN.<br>
Based on the signal strength of EUMTS, the EGGSN requests the UE to scan other RATs. Alternatively, by L2 or by other means, the UE decides to start scanning the other RATs.<br>
The UE sends the measurement report of the UMTS AS to the EGGSN.<br>
The EGGSN could decide to handover the UE to the UMTS AS or alternatively, the UE could request an HO to the UMTS AS. In either case, the EGGSN sends an Inter RAT HO request to the Inter AS MM indicating the cell ID of the UMTS network, the IMSI and the APN.<br>
The Inter AS MM resolves the SGSN ID from the cell ID and GGSN from<br><br>
the APN. The Inter AS MM knows the GGSN that acts as the HA. Hence if the active flows of the UE allow use of the GGSN acting as HA, then the Inter AS MM chooses the GGSN with HA functionality.<br>
The Inter AS MM sends an HO Initiate command to the GGSN including the SGSN ID. The Inter AS MM also includes the EGGSN IP address in the HO Initiate.<br>
The GGSN relays the HO initiate command to the SGSN along with the IMSI.<br>
The SGSN can optionally prepare the RNC for the impending handover by sending an HO Prepare command. However, this requires translation of EUMTS RRC containers to the UMTS RRC containers. This functions can performed at the ENB of the EUMTS and the RRC containers can be included in the Inter RAT HO request sent to the Inter AS MM, which, in turn, relays it to the SGSN through the GGSN in the HO Initiate command.<br>
The RNC responds with an HO Response accepting the HO.<br>
On obtaining the response form the RNC, the SGSN relays the HO Response command to the GGSN.<br>
The GGSN, in turn, relays the HO Response message to the Inter AS MM and starts buffering the UE packets.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the HO response to the EGGSN.<br>
Upon receiving the HO Response, the EGGSN issues an HO command to the UE.<br>
The UE performs an L2 establishment with the UMTS RNC.<br><br>
The UE performs an RA Update procedure with the SGSN. Based on the IMSI in the RAU message the SGSN sends a request to the GGSN to obtain the UE security context. The GGSN obtains the security context from the EGGSN (since it obtains the EGGSN IP address from the Inter AS MM in the HO Initiate command) and passes it to the SGSN.<br>
The UE performs the PDP context activation procedure. Upon PDP context activation from the UE, the SGSN chooses the same GGSN from which it obtained the HO Initiate command for the UE.<br>
. Upon successful establishment of the PDP context, the GGSN sends an HO complete message to the Inter AS MM.<br>
The Inter AS MM relays the HO complete message to the EGGSN.<br>
The HO complete message triggers the EGGSN and ENB to release the network and radio resources allocated to the UE. Optionally, to avoid ping-pong effect, there can be a timer at the EGGSN and the release of the network and radio resources can be made after the expiry of the timer. The HO complete message can also be a trigger for the EGGSN to release the IP address allocated to the UE in case there are no active TCP sessions.<br>
'.The UE performs an MIP de-registration procedure with the GGSN indicating that it is back in the home network. Also, if the CN supports MIP and tunnel overhead is not considered a disadvantage then a BU is performed with the CN. Upon receiving the BU, the GGSN forwards the buffered packets to the UE by changing the destination address in the IP packets to the new IP address of the UE.<br>
. If no active TCP connections are present, then the UE can do SIP based<br><br>
terminal mobility procedure, if it has any active IMS based sessions and can avoid the MIP based mobility procedure.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above.
