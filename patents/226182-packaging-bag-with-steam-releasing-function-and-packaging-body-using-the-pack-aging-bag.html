PACKAGING BAG WITH STEAM RELEASING FUNCTION AND PACKAGING<br>
BODY USING THE PACKAGING BAG<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a packaging bag which keeps foods and the like,<br>
especially relates to the packaging bag having a steam venting function wherein a<br>
steam venting port is opened by a force of an emitted steam when heated by means of a<br>
heating means such as a microwave oven and the like, and relates to a package using<br>
the packaging bag.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, bag-packed foods wherein bags are filled with ready-made or<br>
semi-cooked foods and the like and those are poured into the packaging bags made of<br>
heat resistant films and thus bag-packed foods are heated and cooked by a microwave<br>
oven just before eating, have widely come into the market.<br>
Such packed foods for cooking use when heated directly by the microwave oven<br>
without opening, may possibly contaminate the inner side of the microwave oven by<br>
rupturing the packaging bag and scattering contents as a result of raising the internal<br>
pressure by generated steam and the like which is emitted from foods.<br>
Accordingly, the rupture of the packaging bag has been prevented, for example, by<br>
opening a small air hole and the like or by cutting off a portion by use of scissors and<br>
the like to the packaging bag before cooking by the microwave oven, in order to avoid<br>
the increase of the internal pressure within the inner side of the packaging bag.<br>
However, by such method, since the steam emitted after heating is released<br>
immediately to the outside of the packaging bag, the steam-cooking effect by the<br>
steam decreases and the deterioration of foods may occur as a result of an acceleration<br>
of food dehydration in the packaging bag.<br>
Accordingly, a packaging bag is provided by a sealed package; wherein, for<br>
example, as shown in Fig. 17(a), a laminated film 101 is made as a cylindrical shape,<br>
and at the same surface side, the facing two-edge parts of the film are laid on each<br>
other in a butt-seam manner, and as shown in Fig. 17(b), the laid-on sides are joined by<br><br>
heat-sealing to form an easily peelable region in a part of the region throughout an<br>
entire length in a longitudinal direction, and a cylindrical body is formed by providing<br>
a predetermined width of a heat-sealing part 102, and after said heat-sealing part 102 is<br>
made to be one-sided to one edge side of the cylinder, and after the bag is fabricated by<br>
providing a bottom heat-sealing part 103 by heat-sealing a lower line part of the<br>
cylindrical body excluding the lower line part of the heat-sealing part 102, contents are<br>
filled in from an upper line part of an opening part of the cylindrical body, and then as<br>
shown in Fig.l7(c), the upper line part of the cylindrical body is heat-sealed to provide<br>
a heat-sealing part 104 of the upper part excluding the upper line part of the<br>
heat-sealing part 102.<br>
The packaging bag is described as capable to conduct the steam pressure relief,<br>
when the steam pressure of the internal bag is raised while heating, an easily peelable<br>
region which is made in a part of region in the heat-sealing part 102 delaminates to<br>
release the steam (JP09-150864, A (1997)).<br>
Also, for a part of films of constituting the packaging bag, a device to use an air<br>
permeable film is proposed (JP10-129748, A (1998)).<br>
Moreover, a device is proposed where a narrow seal width is provided to<br>
comprise a narrow seal width in a part of the region in a back seal part of the<br>
packaging bag and in the region of the narrow width part a cutting is made to form an<br>
opening which is capable to open by the internal pressure of the bag (JP11-278557, A<br>
(1999)).<br>
The packaging bag, which is made so as to conduct the steam releasing from a<br>
pait of the heat-sealed packaging bag film as an easily peelable state, is advantageous<br>
Tram the point of fabricating for the reason that different materials are not used, but<br>
even if such packaging bag is applied, when an appearance after heating is observed, a<br>
scattering of contents is found in the easily peelalble region provided in a part of the<br>
region of the heat-seal part of the packaging bag so that the scattering of the contents in<br>
the perfect state and a stain of the inside of the microwave oven are not considered to<br>
be avoidable.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
A packaging bag having a steam venting function and a package using the<br>
packaging bag will now be explained in detail according to the embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
(The first embodiment of the present invention)<br>
A packaging bag 1 according to the first embodiment of the present invention<br><br>
comprises that a front side main body film 2 and a back side main body film 3 which<br>
are respectively laminated films, are laid on, and as shown in Fig.l(b), a bottom seal<br>
part 4 and both sides of side seal parts 5,5 are formed by thermal welding of edge parts<br>
circumference with thermal adhesive sealant layers 2s, 3s which are formed by<br>
lamination in inner surfaces of the laid-on films by means of heat-sealing so that a<br>
content A such as liquid or solid is made so as to enable for filling.<br>
As for the main body film 2 of the above mentioned front side, the front side main<br>
body film 2, by making parallel to the bottom seal part 4 at the bottom seal part 4 side<br>
across an entire width direction of the bag, is bent back toward the bottom seal part 4<br>
side once, and a fold-in part 8 is provided in such a manner that the main body film 2,<br>
which is folded from a valley folding edge 6 to the bottom seal part 4 side, is made to<br>
be folded parallel to the bottom seal part 4 from a mountain folding edge 7 in the<br>
vicinity of the bottom seal part 4, and the fold-in part8 is formed as the form which an<br>
inner sheet part 9 of an inside and an outer sheet 10 of an outside are combined to face<br>
respective thermal adhesive sealant layers 2s each other.<br>
The above mentioned fold-in part 8 formed in the front side main body film 2<br>
comprises one steam venting port 11. The steam venting port 11 is positioned in the<br>
above mentioned inner sheet part 9. The steam venting port 11 may be provided as a<br>
small hole at the center of the inner sheet part or may be provided as a cutout or slit<br>
along the mountain folding edge 7.<br>
Also, in an inside of the fold-in part 8 an easily peelable tape 12 having easily<br>
pee table property is inserted across an entire width of the bag in parallel to the fold-in<br>
part 8. One side of the easily peelable tape 12 is made as an easily peelable side 13 and<br>
the side 13 is positioned so as to face to the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the<br>
above mentioned inner sheet part 9, and the other side is made as a high adhesive side<br>
14 and the sidel4 is positioned so as to face to the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of<br>
the outer sheet part 10, and the required part is heat-sealed in the state that the easily<br>
peelable tape 12 is disposed between the inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10,<br>
and at the heat-sealed region, the easily peelable side 13 of the easily peelable tape 12<br>
and the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner sheet part 9 are thermally welded,<br>
and the high adhesive side 14 of the easily peelable tape 12 and the thermal adhesive<br>
sealant layer 2s of the outer sheet part 10 are thermally welded.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the easily peelable tape 12<br>
is heat-sealed across the entire width of the bag.<br>
And in the region which the easily peelable side 13 of the easily peelable tape 12<br><br>
and the heat adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner sheet part 9 are thermally welded,<br>
the easily peelable tape 12 covers the steam venting port 11 by overlapping the steam<br>
venting port 11. According, the fold-in part 8 is provided to have the seal part 15<br>
which closes the steam venting port 11.<br>
As mentioned above, the seal part 15 is formed by heat-sealing in the state which<br>
the inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10 are laid on placing the easily peelable<br>
tape 12 in between. In the above mentioned seal part 15, the high strength adhesive<br>
side 14 of the easily peelable tape 12 and the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the<br>
outer sheet part 10 are thermally welded and a seal part to make the incapable<br>
delamination even by the increased internal pressure which makes to swell the bag, is<br>
formed between the easily peelabie tape 12 and the outer sheet part 10, as will be<br>
described later. Also, in the seal part 15, the above mentioned easily peelable side 13<br>
of the easily peelable tape 12 and the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner<br>
sheet part 9 are thermally welded and the easily peelabie seal part which delaminates<br>
as a result of the increased internal pressure which makes to swell the bag, is formed<br>
between the easily peelable tape 12 and the inner sheet part 9. And the steam venting<br>
port 11 is positioned in the above mentioned easily peelable seal part.<br>
Since the seal part 15 having the steam venting port 11 comprises the above<br>
mentioned structure, the sealed packaging bag swells by a generation of steam in the<br>
inside of the bag, while cooking in the microwave oven, and when a force so as to<br>
separate the inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet port 10 is added to the fold-in part 8,<br>
at the easily peelable seal portion in the seal part 15, the delamination between the<br>
inner sheet part 9 and the easily peelable tape 12 accelerates and the seal retracts to a<br>
mountain folding edge side of the fold-in part 8, accordingly the steam venting port 11<br>
is opened, and the steam generated in the bag becomes so as to release from the opened<br>
steam venting port 11, and no rupture of the bag occurs by keeping down the excessive<br>
increase of the internal pressure.<br>
The above mentioned both sides of the fold-in part 8 are formed as the side seal<br>
parts 5 while fabricating a bag. And according to the first embodiment, at the side<br>
seal parts 5 of the fold-in part 8, the easily peelable tape 12 is positioned between the<br>
inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10, and the easily peelable sidel3 of the<br>
easily peelable tape 12 at the corresponding position with the side seal parts 5, is also<br>
thermally welded to the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner sheet part 9.<br>
However, when the internal pressure increases to expand the fold-in part 8, the opening<br>
of the above mentioned steam venting port 11 is performed earlier so that the steam<br><br>
venting port 11 is provided not to accelerate the delamination at the side seal parts 5.<br>
According to the first embodiment, in order not to accelerate unnecessary<br>
delamination at both sides of the fold-in part 8, at side seal parts 5 thereof which are<br>
positioned in the opposite to the above mentioned bottom seal part side of the fold-in<br>
part 8 and which are made directly to heat-seal with the front and back main body<br>
films 2, 3, the extended side seal part 16 is formed in the state of a part entered into the<br>
inner side. Accordingly, even in case that the bag is swollen, a force as a result of the<br>
increased inner pressure is difficult to apply to the fold-in part 8 and the side seal part<br>
16 respectively so that the extended side seal part 16 is provided to avoid positively the<br>
delamination at the both sides of the side seal parts 16 of the fold-in part 8.<br>
As for the packaging bag 1, the edge of front and back main body films 2,3 which<br>
is apart from the fold-in part 8 locating facing to the bottom seal part 4 is a top<br>
intended part for heat seal 17 across the width of the bag and is made as the opening<br>
for contents filling use. And as for the packaging bag 1, in the side seal parts 5, at the<br>
height of the position in the vicinity of the bottom seal part 4, an easy cutting means 18<br>
such as a cutout or a machine line and the like is provided. By providing the easy<br>
cutting means 18, the packaging bag as shown below can easily be torn to open<br>
without the use of cutting tools such as scissors and the like. Here, the easy cutting<br>
means 18 can be provided to the position at the height in the vicinity of the top<br>
intended part for heat seal 17.<br>
(Package)<br>
A. package 20 which is heat-sealed at the top seal part 19 is obtained by filling<br>
contents from the opening of the top intended part for heat seal 17 of the above<br>
mentioned packaging bag 1 and by heat sealing the top intended part for heat seal<br>
17(Fig. 4). The package 20 is laid horizontally so as to face up the fold-in part 8 in the<br>
microwave oven and cooked, and when by the increase of temperature in the inside of<br>
the package, the bag is swollen by the swollen air or by the increase of pressure as a<br>
result of the generation of steam, as described above, the space between the inner sheet<br>
part 9 and the outer sheet part 10 opens at the fold-in part 8. And the delaminaition<br>
accelerates at the easily peelable seal part in the seal partl5, and in the state which the<br>
easily peelable tape 12 remains at the outer sheet part 10, the steam venting port 11 is<br>
opened (Fig.5), and from the opened steam venting port 11 the steam is made to<br>
discharge to outward. Accordingly, the package 20 does not make rupture and stain<br>
of the inside of the microwave oven. Also, since the steam venting continues to<br><br>
perform appropriately, a pressure gradually drops and steaming effects and the like can<br>
be added to the cooking materials.<br>
Here, as for the seal part 15, as describe above, before and after contents are filled<br>
into the bag, the steam venting port 11 is closed at room temperature (at normal<br>
atmosphere) of which the packaging bag is made.<br>
(Base layers for the main body film)<br>
The above mentioned front and back main body films 2, 3 comprise a composite<br>
film made of laminated at least a base layer 21 and the above mentioned sealant layers<br>
2s, 3s (Refer to Fig.2(a)). The base layer 21 is film-like or sheet-like material and the<br>
plastic film or sheet having comparatively heat resistive property which is used for<br>
common packaging material, such as polyolefin (polyethylene, polypropylene and the<br>
like), polyester (polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene<br>
naphthalate and the like), polyamide (nylon-6, nylon-66, polyimide and the like) and<br>
their copolymers, can be used.<br>
Also, for the base layer 21, the publicly known additives and if necessary, for<br>
example, antistatic agent, ultraviolet absorber, plasticizer, slipping agent, coloring<br>
agent and the like can be added appropriately. Moreover, the surface of the base layer<br>
21 can be modified by a treatment such as corona discharge treatment or anchor<br>
coating treatment so that the adhesiveness can be improved with the above mentioned<br>
sealaat layer. Also, if necessary, a printed layer (not shown in Figure) on the front or<br>
back side of the base layer can be provided.<br>
Moreover, in order to improve gas barrier property of the main body films 2, 3<br>
having the equivalent property with aluminum foil, an inorganic compound vapor<br>
deposition film provided by aluminum oxide or silica oxide vapor deposition by<br>
chemical vapor deposition ot physical vapor deposition method for the thickness of<br>
approximately 20~100nm, can also be used for the plastic film of the base layer 21.<br>
In the case of the plastic film, an oriented polyethylene terephthalate film can be<br>
preferably used.<br>
(The sealant layer of the main body film)<br>
Resins having thermally welding property such as polyethylene, polypropylene,<br>
ethylenc copolymer, saturated polyester and the like can be used as a sealant layer, and<br>
if the microwave oven suitability and the like is considered, propylene resin having<br>
thickness of approximately 60~80μm can be preferably used.<br><br>
In case that drop strength, thrust strength, or gas barrier property is required to<br>
improve, as shown in Fig.2 (b), an intermediate layer 22 can be made to locate between<br>
the base layer 21 and the sealant layers 2s, 3s. As the intermediate layer 22, for<br>
example, nylon film or polyester film and the like can be used preferably. Also, for the<br>
intermediate layer, the vapor deposition layer of inorganic compounds such as silica,<br>
aluminum oxide and the like can be contained.<br>
The lamination of the base layer 21 and the sealant layers 2s,3s, or the base layer<br>
21 and the intermediate layer 22, or the intermediate layer 22 and the sealant layers 2s,<br>
3s can be performed easily by the dry lamination method by use of, for example,<br>
two-pack polyurethane resin adhesive.<br>
(Easily peelable tape)<br>
The easily peelable film monolayer which is excellent in easily peelable property,<br>
and microwave oven operability is preferable to use for the easily peelable tape 12, and<br>
in more detail, 30 to 50μm thick non-oriented polypropylene resin type easily peelable<br>
film manufactured by Toray Gosei Film Co., Ltd. or TOHCELLO Co., Ltd. is<br>
preferable to use.<br>
(Packaging bag fabricating process)<br>
One example of the bag fabricating process of the above mentioned packaging<br>
bag 1 is illustrated according to Figs.3 (a) to (d).<br>
Initially, in Fig3 (a), while the front side film 2 in a continuous form (as a wind<br>
roll form) is made for an unwinding and run in a horizontal direction (front and back<br>
direction in the Figure), the steam venting port 11 is formed in the region which<br>
becomes the inner sheet part, and then the fold-in part 8 is formed by obtaining the<br>
inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10 where the both sides edge parts 2a,2a of<br>
the film width direction are folded back in reverse direction in turn mutually into<br>
V-letter shape in the position of the valley folding edge 6 and the mountain folding<br>
edge 7 by means of a folding guide plate(not shown in Fig.).<br>
Continuously, the main body film 2 which formed the inner sheet part 9 and the<br>
outer sheet part 10 is made to the unwinding and run, and the easily peelable tape 12 in<br>
the continuous form is inserted horizontally between each inner sheet part 9 and outer<br>
sheet part 10, (front and back direction in Fig.) while the unwinding and run is made<br>
(to insert by way of facing the easily peelable side of the easily peelable tape 12 to the<br>
inner sheet part 9 side, and facing the high strength adhesive side facing to the outer<br><br>
sheet part 10 side ), and the steam venting port 11 is made so as to be covered by the<br>
easily peelable tape 12.<br>
Then, while the main body films 2,3 are made to the unwinding and ran at the<br>
same speed, Fig.3(b), masking shields A (heat masking shields) are inserted below the<br>
inner sheet parts 9 from the upper sides of each edge part 2a,2a of the main body film 2.<br>
And, from the upper sides of the main body film 2 facing toward the portions where<br>
the easily peelable tapes 12 are situated, heat sealers B (long heat seal bars to film-run<br>
direction) are made to operate downward and are made to heat-seal by thermal press,<br>
in such a manner that the thermal adhesive sealant layers 2s of the inner sheet parts 9<br>
and the easily adhesive sides of the easily peelable tapes 12 are made to thermal<br>
welding and also, in such a manner that the high strength adhesive sides of the easily<br>
peelable tapes 12 and the thermal adhesive sealant layers 2s of the outer sheet parts 10<br>
are thermally welded.<br>
Accordingly, the seal parts 15 are formed in the fold-in parts 8 which the inner<br>
sheet parts 9 and the outer sheet parts 10 having the easily peelable tapes 12 in between<br>
are made to face each other, and are formed in the state which the steam venting ports<br>
11 are positioned to the easily peelable seal parts in the seal parts 15.<br>
And then the above mentioned masking shields A are removed from the region of<br>
respective edge parts 2a, 3a of the main body films 2, 3, and after the main body films<br>
2, 2 are temporally made to stop(or while making the unwinding run), as shown in Fig<br>
3(c), respective edge parts 2a, 3a of both edges of the width direction of the main body<br>
films 2, 3 are heat-sealed by the thermal press by making to operate downward of the<br>
upper edge heat sealers D (long heat sealers to the film run direction) from the upper<br>
sides toward each receiving base C. Accordingly, respective edge parts 2a, 3a of both<br>
sides width direction of the main body films 2, 3 are heat-sealed to form the bottom<br>
seal part 4 shown in Fig.l (a) to (b).<br>
And then, side sealers provided to the direction perpendicular to the unwinding<br>
and run direction of the main body films 2, 3 (long and narrow heat seal bars to the<br>
film width direction comprising side seal width, not shown in Figure) are made to<br>
operate downward to the direction perpendicular to the unwinding and run direction of<br>
the main body films 2, 3 against a side seal receiving base E at even intervals to the<br>
unwinding direction, and the sealant layers 2s, 3s which face mutually at the side parts<br>
of the main body films 2, 3 and laid-on portions of the edge parts of the fold-in parts 8<br>
(the portions which the inner sides of the inner side parts face to the easily peelable<br>
sides of the easily peelable tapes each other and which the high strength adhesive sides<br><br>
of the easily peelable tapes face to the inner sides of the outer sheet parts each<br>
other)are thermally pressed.<br>
Here, in the edge parts of the fold-in parts 8, the inner sides of the inner sheet<br>
parts 9 and the inner sides of the outer sheet parts 10 can be made so as to face each<br>
other directly, by providing through holes in the edge parts of the easily peelable tapes<br>
12, or by providing the width sides of the easily peelable tapes 12 to smaller size than<br>
the up-down size of the fold-in parts 8, and if such cases are provided, the portions are<br>
also heat-sealed by the above mentioned side sealer E.<br>
To the laid-on main body films 2, 3 by this way, the side seal parts 5 are formed at<br>
even intervals to the perpendicular direction against the unwinding direction.<br>
The inner sheet parts 9 in the main body film 2 are thermally pressed by the above<br>
mentioned side sealer in the laid-on state with the main body film 2 besides the fold-in<br>
paris 8, but the mutual facing surfaces of the main body film 2 of the bottom seal parts<br>
4 side and the opposing above mentioned inner sheet parts 9, become the non-seal state<br>
which the side seals are not made, since the thermal adhesive sealant layers 2s made of<br>
a low melting point thermal adhesive resin are situated to the opposite side base layers<br>
each other (higher melting point than sealant layer 2s resin).<br>
Accordingly, the main body films 2, 3 which are formed by heat seal are cut<br>
parallel to the film unwinding and run direction along the cutting line F of the central<br>
part of the film width direction as shown in Fig.3(d), and the packaging bags 1 which<br>
open at the top intended parts for heat seal 17 are fabricated.<br>
(The second embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Figs. 6 to 9 show the second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
As for the examples, the seal part 15 is formed by heat-sealing throughout the<br>
upper tine portion along the mountain folding edge 7 of the fold-in part 8 to the bag<br>
width direction. And the above mentioned seal part 15 has three non-seal parts 23<br>
comprising non-seal region wherein one side is continuous to the mountain folding<br>
edge 7 and three sides are surrounded by the seal region and the above mentioned<br>
steam venting ports 11 are positioned to said non-seal parts 23. The steam venting<br>
ports 11 are formed by cutting with integrating the inneT sheet part 9 and the easily<br>
peelable tape 12 and the outer sheet part 10 in the non-seal parts 23.<br>
The above seal region is the portion which is heat-sealed all in one, as mentioned<br>
above where the easily peelable tape 12 is positioned between the inner sheet part 9<br>
and the outer sheet part 10 in the seal part 15, and is the portion which the above<br><br>
mentioned easily peelable seal portion and the high strength adhesive seal portion are<br>
laid on. As mentioned above, the easily peelable seal portion is the heat-sealed<br>
portion in a state which the delamination is capable when the bag is swollen by the<br>
steam pressure, and the high strength seal portion is the heat-sealed portion in a state<br>
which the delamination is incapable even when the bag is swollen by the steam<br>
pressure. On the other hand, the non-heat seal region is made to be laid on in the seal<br>
part 15 in such a manner that the easily peelable tape 12 is situated between the inner<br>
sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10, but is the portion which the heat seal is not<br>
performed.<br>
Also, according to the second embodiment of the present invention, the width size<br>
of the easily peelable tape 12 is provided to larger size than the height size along the<br>
perpendicular direction to the longitudinal direction of the fold-in part of the inner<br>
sheet part 9, and the high strength adhesive 14 side of a lower edge part 24 of the<br>
easily peelable tape 12 is thermally welded by heat seal to the thermal adhesive sealant<br>
layer 2s which is the inner side of the main body film 2 continuous to the outer sheet<br>
part 10 so that the delaminaiton by steam pressure is in incapable state. The easily<br>
peelable side 13 at the lower edge part 24 of the easily peelable tape 12 does not face<br>
to the inner sheet part 8 and is in the non-adhesive state.<br>
Also, in the both edge parts of the easily peelable tape 12, the high strength<br>
adhesive side 14 of the easily peelable tape 12 is heat-sealed to the outer sheet part 10<br>
and the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the main body film 2 of the contents filled<br>
part side which continues to the outer sheet part 10, while the easily peelable side 13 is<br>
heat-sealed to the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner sheet part 9 and the<br>
thermal adhesive sealant layer 3s of the back side of the main body film 3.<br>
Accordingly, also in the both sides of the side seal parts 5 of the fold-in part 8,<br>
the easily peelable side 13 of the easily peelable tape 12 has the portion which is<br>
thermally welded with the opposing side portion by heat-sealing, and when the bag is<br>
swollen, the above mentioned steam venting ports 11 are opened so that the seal<br>
retraction at the portion is provided so as not to occur and also, a device is made to<br>
avoid the seal retraction in accordance with the following structure.<br>
Accordingly, in the side seal parts 5 of the fold-in part 8, respective edge parts of<br>
the easily peelable tape 12 in the position are provided with punched holes 25 as<br>
shown in Fig.6(c), and through the punched holes 25, the thermal adhesive sealant<br>
layers 2s, 2s of the inner sheet part 9 and the outer sheet part 10 are laid on each other<br>
under direct contact and are thermally welded by heat-sealing so that the seal retraction<br><br>
is made not to occur as described above. The shape of the punched holes 25 is not<br>
limited specifically, and in the portions situated at the side seal parts 5 of the fold-in<br>
part 8, the punched holes 25 are punched with one spot or more, with the shape of<br>
straight line or dotted line, for example, the punched holes 25 can be made to be<br>
punched in making straight line or dotted line in intermittently two or multiple spots.<br>
As for the packaging bag 1 according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the package 20 sealed at the top seal part 19 is obtained by heat-sealing the<br>
lop intended part for heat seal 17 after contents are filled. And, when the package 20<br>
is swollen by heating, as shown in Fig.7, the fold-in part 8 is opened and the steam<br>
venting port 11 is opened and the steam can be released from the inner side.<br>
(Packaging bag fabricating process)<br>
One example of the bag fabricating process of the above mentioned packaging<br>
bag 1 is illustrated according to Figs.8 (a) to (f).<br>
Initially, in Fig8(a), the fold-in parts 8 are formed by obtaining the inner sheet<br>
parts 9 and the outer sheet parts 10 where the two sides edge parts 2a, 2a of the film<br>
width direction are folded back in reverse direction in turn each other into V-letter<br>
shape in the positions of the valley folding edges 6 and the mountain folding edges 7<br>
by means of a folding guide plate(not shown in Fig.), while the front side of film 2 in a<br>
continuous form(as a wind roll form) is made to the unwinding and run in a horizontal<br>
direction(front and back direction in Fig.), simultaneously.<br>
And then, while the main body film 2 which formed the inner sheet parts 9 and<br>
the outer sheet parts 10 is made to the unwinding and run (Fig8(a)), to the under side of<br>
the main body film 2, the main body film3 in the back side of the continuous form(the<br>
wind roll form) is made to the unwinding and run with the same run speed to the<br>
horizontal direction (front and back side direction in Figure) in adjusting with both<br>
edges, parts 2a, 2a of the main body film 2, simultaneously, and the easily peelable<br>
tapes 12 in a continuous form are inserted into the space of each inner sheet part 9 and<br>
the outer sheet part 10 horizontally (front and back side direction in Figure) while<br>
making the unwinding and run. Here, in the positions which become the<br>
corresponding parts to the side seal parts 5 of the fold-in parts 8 of the easily peelable<br>
tapes 12, the above mentioned punched holes 25 are previously punched.<br>
Fig.8(b), simultaneously with the insertion of the easily peelable tapes 12,<br>
masking shields G (thermal resistive heat masking shields made of metal and the like)<br>
are inserted horizontally between respective edge parts 2a, 2a of the above mentioned<br><br>
main body film 2 and respective edge parts 3a, 3a of the back side of the main body<br>
film 3.<br>
And after the main body films 2,3 are temporally made to stop (or while making<br>
the unwinding and run of the main body films 2, 3), from the upper side of the main<br>
body film 2 to the lower edge parts 24 of the easily peelable tapes 12, heat sealers H<br>
(long heat seal bars to the film run direction) are made to operate downward (or to<br>
make operating downward while removing at the same speed as the film run speed),<br>
and the sealant layer 2s of the main body film 2 and the lower edge parts 24 of the<br>
easily peelable tapes 12 are thermally pressed.<br>
Accordingly, the high strength sides 14 of the lower edge parts 24 of the easily<br>
peelable tapes 12 are heat-sealed to the sealant layer 2s of the main body film 2 in<br>
incapable state of the delamination by the steam pressure, and the easily peelable sides<br>
13 of the lower edge parts 24 of the easily peelable tapes 12 and the sealant layer 3s of<br>
the main body film 3 are not heat-sealed by the masking shields G so that lower part<br>
seal parts 26 are formed by keeping non-adhesive state. Here, according to the<br>
present invention, the formation of the lower part seal parts 26 can be omitted if<br>
necessary, and in that case, the fabrication process of the lower part seal parts 26 can<br>
be omitted.<br>
And then, while the main body films 2, 3 are made to the unwinding and run in<br>
the same speed, Fig.8(c), simultaneously, the masking shields A (the heat masking<br>
shield plates) are inserted from the upper side of respective edge parts 2a, 2a of the<br>
main body film 2 to under the inner sheet parts 9.<br>
And from the upper side of the main body film 2 against the portions where the<br>
upper edge part of the easily peelable tapes 12 (the parts of the mountain folding edge<br>
sides) is situated, the heat sealers B (the long heat seal bars to the film run direction)<br>
are made to operate downward, and to heat-seal by thermal press in such a manner that<br>
the thermal adhesive sealant layer 2s of the inner sheet parts 9 and the easily peelable<br>
side 13 of the easily peelable tapes 12 are thermally welded, and also, in such a manner<br>
that the high strength adhesive side 14 of the easily peelable tapes 12 and thermal<br>
adhesive sealant layer 2s of the outer sheet parts 10 are thermally welded.<br>
Accordingly, the seal parts 15 are formed to the fold-in parts 8 which the inner<br>
sheet parts 9 and the outer sheet parts 10 providing the easily peelable tapes 12 in<br>
between are made to facing each other. In the seal parts 15, as mentioned above, the<br>
non-seal parts 23 are provided so as to continue to the mountain folding edges 7 at the<br>
positions of the center and right and left of the bag.<br><br>
In the state which the above mentioned masking shields A are located, the steam<br>
venting ports 11 are provided to each of the above mentioned non-seal parts 23 by<br>
punching blades 27. Accordingly, the easily peelable seal parts in the seal parts 15<br>
are in the state of surrounding respective steam venting ports 11.<br>
And then, after the above mentioned masking shields A are removed from the<br>
region of respective edge parts 2a, 3a of the main body films 2, 3 and the main body<br>
films 2, 3 are temporally made to stop (or while making the unwinding run), as shown<br>
in Fig.8(e), the upper edge heat sealers D (long heat-seal bars in the film run direction)<br>
are made to operate downward from the upper side of each edge 2a, 3a of width<br>
direction at both edges of the main body films 2, 3 to each receiving base C and<br>
heat-seal by thermally press. Accordingly, respective edge parts 2a, 3a, of the width<br>
direction at both edges of the main body films 2, 3 are heat-sealed and the bottom seal<br>
paris 4 are formed.<br>
And then, Fig.8(f), a side sealer(a long and narrow heat seal bar to the film width<br>
direction comprising a side seal width, not shown in the Figure.) which is provided in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the unwinding run direction of the main body films 2, 3, is<br>
made to operate downward to the side seal receiving base E in the direction<br>
perpendicular to the unwinding run direction of the main body films2, 3 and to the<br>
unwinding run direction at even intervals, and thermally presses to the sealant layers 2s,<br>
3s mutually facing to the side parts of the main body films 2, 3 and the laid-on parts of<br>
the edge parts of the fold-in parts 8(the portions which the inside of the inner sheet<br>
parts faces to the easily peelable side of the easily peelable tapes and which the high<br>
strength adhesive side of the easily peelable tapes faces to the inside of the outer sheet<br>
parts).<br>
Here, at this point, in the edge parts of the fold-in parts 8, the inside of the inner<br>
sheet parts 9 and the inside of the outer sheet parts 10 are directly facing and are<br>
heat-sealed mutually by heat sealer E through the punched holes 25 of the edge parts of<br>
the easily peelable tapes 12.<br>
Accordingly in the laid-on main body films 2, 3, the side seal parts 5 are formed<br>
at even intervals in the direction perpendicular to the unwinding direction.<br>
Accordingly the main body films 2, 3 which are formed by heat-sealing, as shown<br>
in Fig.8 (f), are cut in parallel to the film unwinding run direction along a cutting line F<br>
at the center part of the film width direction and the packaging bags 1 which open at<br>
the positions of the top intended parts for heat seal 17 are fabricated as the bags.<br>
According to the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, the seal parts 15<br><br>
are formed so as to continue to the regions of the side seal parts 5, and as shown in<br>
Fig.9 (a), at both edges of the seal parts 15, the noft-seal parts 27, which are a line<br>
symmetry in making the vertical central line 0 of the packaging bag 1 as an axis of<br>
symmetry and which are not performed by heat sealing, may be acceptable to be<br>
provided.<br>
Also, lower lines of the seal parts 15 may be acceptable as forms which provide<br>
declining lines 28 to be the forms which project upward in the line symmetry making<br>
the vertical central line 0 of the packaging bag 1 as an axis of symmetry, in such a<br>
manner that the steam which is generated in the bag flows smoothly toward the steam<br>
venting ports 11.<br>
Also, the shapes of the above mentioned steam venting ports 11, as shown in<br>
Fig. 9(a), can be acceptable nearly as a square shape one side open which comprises<br>
oblique or vertical downward short straight lines in the both edges of the straight line<br>
shape in parallel to the straight line of the mountain folding edge 7 or can be<br>
acceptable nearly as a mountain folding shape or nearly a circular arc shape which<br>
projects to the above mentioned straight line, or as shown in Fig.9(b), can be<br>
acceptable as an oblique lines as tapered double lines like shape. An oblong shape,<br>
ellipse shape besides narrow line slit shape (or extremely narrow line slit shape) as a<br>
pierce providing a hole, can be acceptable for the steam venting ports 11 if necessary.<br>
Also, the non-seal parts 23 of the above mentioned steam venting ports 11 are not<br>
always required.<br>
(The third embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Fig.10 shows the third embodiment of the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment, at the center of the fold-in part 8, the seal part 15 is formed so as to<br>
continue to the mountain folding edge 7, and is made as a discontinuous state with both<br>
sides of side seal parts 5 through the non-seal part 27 in the fold-in part 8. Also, the<br>
above mentioned seal part 15 has the non-seal part 23 so as to continue to the mountain<br>
folding edge 7, and at the non-seal part 23, the steam venting port 11 is formed as a<br>
cutout type. Moreover, the right and left lower Vines of the lower line of the seal part<br>
15 are made as the oblique lower lines 28.<br>
And as shown in Fig., the side seal parts 5 which are located adjacent to the<br>
fold-in part 8 and the opposite side of the bottom seal part 4 are provided by the<br>
extended seal parts 29 which are extended toward the central side of the bag. Since<br>
the extended seal parts 29 are provided in such a way, when the package obtained from<br><br>
the packaging bag 1 is cooked, the steam flow is guided to the steam venting port 11<br>
side so that the pressure is designed so as to make difficult to apply to the both sides of<br>
the side seal part of the fold-in part 8. Also, since the side seal parts 5 are made to be<br>
partly wide, temperature increase of the extended seal parts 29 is so low that the<br>
extended seal parts 29 as the picking-up parts, are made to be able to pick up with<br>
finger tips even immediately after the bag is cooked by the microwave oven.<br>
(The fourth embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Fig. 11 shows the fourth embodiment of the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment, in the center and right and left sides of the fold-in part 8, three seal parts<br>
15 are formed so as to continue to the mountain folding edges 7, and the right and left<br>
seal parts 15 are made in a continuous state with both sides of the side seal parts 5 in<br>
the fold-in part 8. Also, the above mentioned seal parts 15 have the non-seal parts 23<br>
so as to continue to the mountain folding edges 7 where in the non-seal parts 23 the<br>
steam venting ports 11 are formed as a cutout type. Moreover, the seal part 15 at the<br>
central position and the seal parts 15 at right and left are provided in the discontinuous<br>
state through the non-seal parts 27, and each steam venting port 11 and the above<br>
mentioned non-seal parts 27 are made to provide so as to be adjacent. Accordingly as<br>
performing in such a way, the opening of each steam venting port 11 can be conducted<br>
satisfactorily even having multiple steam venting ports 11.<br>
(The fifth embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 show the fifth embodiment. According to the embodiment,<br>
the lateral side seal parts 30 are formed by interposing the central seal part 15 of the<br>
fold-in part 8 between the right side and left side. The above mentioned side seal<br>
parts 30 are made by heat-sealing the fold-in part 8 so as to continue to the mountain<br>
folding edge 7 with a longitudinal direction of the fold-in part 8 extending in a<br>
perpendicular direction, and continue to the seal parts 31 which are made by<br>
heat-sealing of the front and back of the main body films 2, 3 in the filling region with<br>
the opposite side of the bottom seal part 4 of the fold-in part 8. The lateral side seal<br>
parts 30 are provided in the line symmetry with making the packaging bag vertical line<br>
as an axis of symmetry. Also, the above mentioned lateral side seal parts 30 can be<br>
made to have the horizontal part along the mountain folding edge 7 as shown in Figs.<br>
12 and 13.<br>
Accordingly, by providing the lateral side seal parts 30, while the package filled<br><br>
with contents is cooked by the microwave oven and the like, the swell is held down by<br>
side seal parts 30 even if the package swells by the internal pressure of generated<br>
steam and the like so that the seal retraction of both sides of the fold-in part 8 can be<br>
prevented,<br>
(The sixth embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Fig.14 and Fig.15 show the sixth embodiment of the present invention. According<br>
to the embodiment, the non-seal parts 23 are located in the center of the fold-in part 8,<br>
and the steam venting port 11 is positioned in the non-seal part 23 and the seal part 15<br>
is provided to be a convex facing against opposite side to the mountain folding edge 7,<br>
arid further, the lateral side seal parts 33 comprising the non-sealing part 23 in the both<br>
sides of the central seal part 15 are provided to side by side through the non-seal parts<br>
27,<br>
And in the above mentioned central seal part 15, the seal width at the width<br>
direction of the bag of the vertical parts 34 continuous to the mountain folding edge 7<br>
of ihe seal region is provided to larger size than the seal width at the perpendicular<br>
direction to the width direction or" the bag of the horizontal part 35 along the width<br>
direction of the bag of the seal region. By such a manner, the seal retraction is held<br>
down by the vertical parts 34 at the seal part 15 even if the bag is swollen and the flow<br>
of trie steam is made in capable to control.<br>
Moreover, in respective lateral side seal parts 33, the vertical parts 34 of the side<br>
seal part side of the seal region are provided to extend to the opposite side to the<br>
mountain folding edge 7, and the horizontal parts 35 of the seal region is inclined so as<br>
to lean to the opposite side with the mountain folding edge as approaching from the<br>
seal parts 15 sides to the side seal parts 5 sides. By such a manner, when the bag is<br>
swollen, the swell shifts to the central seal parts 15 sides and can be made not to shift<br>
to the side seal parts 5 sides.<br>
(The s eventh embodiment of the present invention)<br>
Fig.16 shows the seventh embodiment of the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment, the seal width of the side seal parts 5 is made to change across the length<br>
direction of the side seal part. Namely, the seal width of the side seal parts 5 in the<br>
vicinity of the bottom seal part 4 is made to be narrower than the seal width of the side<br>
seal parts 5 in the vicinity of the top intended part for heat seal 17 in the opposing<br>
position of the bottom seal part 4. Accordingly, the seal width of the side seal part 5<br><br>
is made to be gradually broad width from the vicinity location of the bottom seal part 4<br>
as approaching to the vicinity position of the above mentioned top intended part for<br>
heat seal 17.<br>
By this means, even if the package is swollen by heating, the center of swelling is<br>
made so as to slide to the fold-in part 8 side, and even if the top seal part is made to be<br>
the impurities seal state, the seal retraction at the top seal part can be made to prevent.<br>
