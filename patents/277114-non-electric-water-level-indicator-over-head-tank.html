				<td>3.        NON-ELECTRIC WATER LEVEL INDICATOR OVER HEAD TANK<br>
This invention relates to improvement of indicating the water level which works by its own (without the help of any external supply ie electrical supply)<br>
Now a days it is a problem for many people as the Over Head Tank in a house is generally kept at such places where it is not very easy to access to the said Over Head Tank for its level which is rather not only time consuming but also in terms of wastage of manpower, electricity and water.<br>
Many of the Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank are available in the market which does not give the accurate indication of level of water of Over Head Tank as &amp; when required by us. Some of these indicators are working on float principle which gives only the opportunity to stop the incoming flow of water automatically when Over Head Tank becomes full without giving any indication to the user that tank is full. If the supply of water is coming form a motor, the motor is likely to be adversely affected and this float system does not indicates the minimum level of tank. Other indicators are working on electrical supply which gives indication to user only when Over Head Tank is full and main draw back is the combination of water and electricity which nevertheless may lead to a disaster.<br>
These problems are overcome by the present invention, which provides a Water Level Indication with the help of water pressure, after sensing and calculating the pressure, gives the accurate level of Over Head Tank with out use of any external supply at any chosen place of users(Near washbasin /Kitchen sink).<br>
In one form of the invention, the pressure applied to the Balloon is sensed by the helical spring provided in the invention and the same pressure is calculated by helical spring with the help of Center Adjuster and Self Adjuster and indicated with the help of level indicator according to the level of water in the Over Head Tank.<br>
The gripper and balloon may be made of plastic and rubber.<br>
The Outer Body, Tool Gripper, Self Adjuster, Center Adjuster, Center Adjuster Stopper, Cap, Knob and Level Indicator may be made of plastic and metal.<br>
The window may be made of plastic and glass. The Tool Gripper may be made in hexagonal and square shape. To  assist with understanding the invention,  reference  will  now be  made accompanying drawing which show one example of the invention.<br>
Brief description of the drawing:<br>
Fig 1.  Shows an example of Non- Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank according to the invention.<br>
 <br>
Fig 2. Shows the application of such Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank to a storage supply line.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
1.        A NON-ELECTRICAL WATER LEVEL INDICATOR OVER HEADTANK comprising of an enclosure, cylindrical ratangular, triangular, square, rhombous etc in shape, of height varying from 10mm, consisting of a balloon made up of bladder, rubber, latex, nylon, chloroprene, plastic film etc, within which is the spring of the shape of coil, helical, conical, volute etc thereof, connected with the adjusters, giving an accurate reading without the supply of any A.C. or D.C. current to the whole device.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiments:<br>
Referring to Fig 1 can be seen that Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank according to this invention comprised of a balloon (5) comprised of an elasticised plastic having a gripper (3) which enables the hold of balloon (5) to the neck (2). The neck (2) is having outer threads to be tighten with storage supply line. To have the proper tightening the Tool Gripper (4) is provided with hexagonal shape. The neck (2) and Tool Gripper (4) are the part and partial of Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank outer body (1) made of plastic having a reverse L cut to hold the Cap (14).<br>
Over the balloon (5) the level indicator (6) is resting having reverse T shape made of plastic and level indicator (6) is having two helical springs (7) resting over level indicator (6) which sensing the pressure of water and with the help of Center Adjuster (9) and Self Adjuster (8) after calculating the pressure gives accurate indication on window (10).<br>
The Center Adjuster (9) is a ring of plastic having inner threads with inter linking to the threads of Self Adjuster (8) and also Center Adjuster (9) has two screws as a Center Adjuster Stopper (11) made of metal which allows Center Adjuster (9) not to move on Outer body (1) and with the help of Holes (12) on Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank outer body (1) provided to allow to hold the Center Adjuster (9) at any required position.<br>
The Self Adjuster (8) having outer threads corresponding to the inner threads of Center Adjuster (9) made of plastic and having a barrel shape with a flat ring at bottom having projection at outer edges to guide helical springs (7). The Self Adjuster (8) is having push fit slots at the top outer side to give a hold to the Knob (13) where Knob (13) is comprises of plastic having inner push fit slots to be fixed with Self Adjuster (8) gives movements to Self Adjuster (8) in clockwise and anti clockwise direction.<br>
The Self Adjuster (8) and Center Adjuster (9) collectively gives the place to the helical springs (7) for movement (expand and compress) for the indication of water level through the window (10).<br>
 <br>
The Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank outer body (1) is attached with a Cap (14) comprised of plastic having two lugs to keep intact with outer body (1) to avoid moisture, dust and damage to the Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank mechanism.<br>
Fig 2 shows that Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank in operation. It can be seen that a Storage Supply Line (15) has a Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank (16) connected to it and level indicator (6) is indicating the accurate level of water on window (10) in the Over Head Tank.<br>
By use of a Non-Electric Water Level Indicator Over Head Tank the water level of Over Head Tank can be seen easily by any person as and when required.<br>
<br>
<br>
