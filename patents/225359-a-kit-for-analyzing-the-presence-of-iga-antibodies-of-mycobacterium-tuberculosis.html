				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a kit for analyzing the presence of IgA antibodies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.<br>
Tuberculosis is a persistent problem in the developing world and biggest cause of mortality. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections often results in pulmonary disease but can cause skin infections, lymphadentis, meningitis and other manifestations beside the advent of AIDS has made the diseases a major public health problem which has recently been exacerbated by increasing numbers of high- risk patients. For more than a century detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis generally relieves on a combination of staining of acid fast bacilli ( AFB) and culture. AFB staining is unable to identify the species of different mycobacterium while culture needs 6 weeks time for result interpretation. So, inadequacies of the sputum smear test and the rise of TB epidemic have renewed efforts to develop new and innovative approaches to TB diagnosis.<br>
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by repeated exposure to airborne droplets contaminated with rod- shape bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The TB bacterium is also known as the tubercle bacilli. A person with active pulmonary tuberculosis can spread the disease by coughing and sneezing. Once the person infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the infection will slowly progress to disease. More than 8 million new cases of Tuberculosis for more than three million deaths per year. Almost two and three quarter billion people (2.75 billion) or 33% of population are latently infected with TB.<br>
Among screening infectious diseases, a accurate and fast diagnostic method of tuberculosis is very important for human health maintain and the disease control.<br>
To improve the tuberculosis diagnosis, we search and select the specific<br><br><br>
antigens and prepare diagnostic kits for the detection of antibodies in serum / plasma and other body fluids.<br>
With the selection of appropriate antigen for use in serology test, it is important to increase the sensitivity without losing specificity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Organisms within the genus Mycobacterium include obligate parasites, saprophytes, and opportunistic pathogens. Most species are free-living in soil and water, but for species such as M. tuberculosis the causative agents of tuberculosis, the major ecological niche is the tissue of humans and other warm blooded animals.<br>
Despite the fact that most mycobacteria do not cause disease, a relatively small group of organisms within the genus is responsible for a large percentage of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem, with nearly one third of the world's population infected. Indeed, tuberculosis is the leading cause of death due to a single infectious agent. In addition, the World Health Organization estimates that worldwide, there are 8-10 million new cases and over 3 million deaths directly attributed to this disease reported worldwide<br>
M. tuberculosis is exceptionally easily transmitted, as it is carried in airborne particles termed "droplet nuclei," produced when a patient with active tuberculosis coughs. These particles are from 1-5 micro meter in size, and are readily suspended in air currents. Infection occurs when droplet nuclei are inhaled and reach the terminal airways of the new host's lungs. Usually, the host immune response limits the multiplication and spread of the organism, although some organisms may remain dormant, but viable, for many years post-infection. Individuals infected with M. tuberculosis but without disease, usually have a<br><br>
positive skin test (Le., with purified protein derivative [PPO]), but are asymptomatic and generally not infectious. However, latently infected individuals have a 10% risk for developing active tuberculosis at some point during their life; the risk is greatest within the first two years of post-infection. For HIV-positive individuals, the risk is much greater, with the risk at 10-15% per year for progression to active disease (F. S. Nolte and B. Metchock, "Mycobacterium," in Manual of Clinical Microbiology, Sixth).<br>
The field of diagnostic and clinical microbiology has continued to evolve, and yet, there remains a general need for systems that provide rapid and reliable detection of disease and infection due to micro-organisms such as M. tuberculosis. Nonetheless, the role of the clinical mycobacteriology laboratories cannot be underestimated in view of their potential contributions in controlling the spread of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis disease through the timely detection, isolation, identification, and determination of drug susceptibility of these organisms. There is a "new sense of urgency" regarding the reporting of acid-fast smear, cultures, and drug susceptibility results to physicians, prompted in large part to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Traditionally, tuberculosis surveillance has involved the use of preliminary skin tests (e.g., tuberculin tests), with positives being further evaluated for active disease by radiographic analysis (Le., chest X-rays), and sputum cultures. Other samples are sometimes submitted to the laboratory for culture, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial washings, gastric lavage fluids, urine, body fluids (e.g., cerebrospinal [CSF], pleura), peritoneal, pericardia), etc.), tissues (e.g., lymph nodes, skin, or other biopsy materials), abscess contents, aspirated fluids.<br>
Culture Methods: Once a specimen has been received in the laboratory suspected of containing mycobacteria, the specimen will generally be stained and examined for the presence of AFB. Sputum and other i'dirty specimens are<br><br>
decontaminated and concentrated prior to staining, culturing &amp; Immunological methods.<br>
Methods for diagnosis of tuberculosis based on immunological methods such as detection of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin responses, as well as the detection of anti-mycobacteria antibodies, or mycobacterial antigens have been studied. Historically, skin tests have been commonly used as indicators of infection with M. tuberculosis. The tuberculin skin test, still commonly in use, was the first immuno diagnostic test developed for detection of tuberculosis. Problems with this test include its inability to distinguish active disease from past sensitization, as well as its unknown predictive accuracy.<br>
The analysis of clinical specimens is important in science and medicine. A wide variety of assays to determine qualitative and/or quantitative characteristics of a specimen are known in the art.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
Various conventional kits are available which have limitations to carry out tests either by serum or whole blood, but no device is available which can be used and give high sensitivity with either serum or sputum or plasma.<br>
Nucleic acid PCR based genetic test: DNA detection test where a single DMA molecule is amplified in the presence of Taqpol enzyme in thermocycle. It is a sensitive technique which requires skill, knowledge and sophisticated instruments to run PCR.<br>
US Patent no. 6291178 describes a method for the preservation of bodily fluid samples. The invention describes a method for the preservation and storage of human saliva samples for use in subsequent component testing thereof.<br><br>
US Patent no 6383763 describes a methods and compositions for the detection of infection and disease due to members of the genus Mycobacterium. In particular, the present invention is well-suited to the detection and identification of patients with disease or infection due to M. tuberculosis or MAC.<br>
US Patent no 6583266 features nucleic acid and proteins derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and leprae. The proteins and nucleic acid of the present invention have applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.<br>
The main disadvantage of the culture is the need- for more sophisticated resources and more qualified technicians because specificity can suffer due to care less techniques. The total test time may take 3-4 weeks for confirmation of results . Sometimes the slide preparation is not perfect. Diagnostic delay of culture, kills time and clinical interpretations.<br>
Tuberculosis is a persistent problem in the developing world and biggest cause of morality. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections often results in pulmonary disease but can cause skin infections, lymphadenitis, meningitis and other manifeslations beside advent of AIDS has made the disease a major public health problem which has recently been exacerbated by increasing numbers of high-risk patients. For more than a Century detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis generally relieves on a combination of staining of acid fast bacilli (AFB) and culture. AFB staining is unable to identify the species of different mycobacterium while culture needs 6 weeks time for result interpretation. So, inadequacies of the sputum smear test and the rise of TB epidemic have renewed efforts to develop new and innovative approaches to TB diagnosis. TB-A Microlisa developed as a indirect elisa test for the detection of IgA antibodies which demonstrate a superior performance against serum test. As this test can be done with serum also, so in case of paediatric patient, it is difficult to get their sputum whereas serum is easy to get.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for analyzing the presence of IgA antibodies of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis in sera or plasma by ELISA and easy test method. Specific antigen is coated in the Microwell of Elisa plate &amp; then serum added to the well. The Tuberculosis antibodies which are present in the serum will attach ( bind) to antigen present in the well and make a complex. Unbound material is washed with wash buffer. Then conjugate added in the well ( Anti human IgA linked to HRPO). Then secondary antibody will bind to the complex. Unbound material is washed and followed by the addition of substrate and colour complex is formed, which is read at 450 nm.<br>
