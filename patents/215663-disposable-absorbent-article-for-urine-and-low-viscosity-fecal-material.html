				<td>ZONED DISPOSABLE ABSORBENT ARTICLE<br>
FOR URINE AND LOW-VISCOSITY rCCAL MATERIAL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to disposable absorbent articles, such as diapers and adult incontinence products, and more particularly to disposable absorbent articles which have the ability to effectively handle both urine and low-viscosity fecal material<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many types of disposable absorbent products, such as diapers, are available that have a high capacity for absorbing urine. Disposable products of this type generally comprise some sort of fluid-permeable topsheet material, an absorbent core, and a fluid-impermeable backsheet material. Although these types of absorbent structures may be highly efficient for the absorption of fluids, they cannot absorb bowel movements (i.e., hereinafter referred to as "BM"). Typically, the BM is trapped between the outer surface of the fluid-permeable topsheet and the skin of the wearer, much of it adhering to the wearer's skin.<br>
To prevent BM from adhering to the wearer's skin, the caregiver often applies protective or "repellent" products such as vaseline or mineral oil to the buttocks and anal region before placing the absorbent article on the wearer. This procedure usually involves the caregiver's pouring of the oil or lotion, for example, in one of their hands, rubbing both hands together to distribute the substance thereon and then wiping the same on the skin of the infant. To eliminate the need for this wasteful, messy, and easily forgotten procedure, there have been numerous previous attempts to prepare absorbent<br>
articles which contain a protective or therapeutic skin care substance on the topsheet.<br><br>
One substance that has been applied as a lotion to absorbent products to impart a<br>
soothing, protective coating is mineral oil. Mineral oil (also known as liquid petrolatum) is a mixture of various liquid hydrocarbons obtained by distilling the high-boiling (i.e., 300°-390°C) fractions in petroleum. Mineral oil is liquid at ambient temperatures, e.g. 20<br>
°-25°C.   As'a result, mineral oil is relatively fluid and mobile, even when applied to article topsheets.<br>
Because mineral oil is fluid and mobile at ambient temperatures, it tends not to remain localized on the surface of the topsheet, but instead migrates through the topsheet into the interior of the diaper. Accordingly, relatively high levels of mineral oil need to be applied to the topsheet to provide the desired therapeutic or protective coating lotion benefits. This leads not only to increased costs for these lotioned products, but other detrimental effects as well.<br>
One of these detrimental effects is a decrease in the fluid handling properties as high levels of mineral oil tend to block the topsheet openings. Also, as mineral oil migrates to the interior of the article, it tends to act as a hydrophobic additive, thus decreasing the absorbency of the underlying absorbent core, if one is used. This decrease in absorbency becomes more pronounced as the level of mineral oil applied is increased.<br>
Past attempts to solve the problems associated with BM compromised the urine handling properties of the article. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a disposable absorbent article having superior urine and BM handling properties.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is a disposable absorbent article, such as a diaper. The disposable absorbent article has a first region juxtaposed with the front of the wearer and a second region juxtaposed with the back of the wearer. The disposable absorbent article comprises a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet joined to the topsheet, and an absorbent core positioned between the topsheet and the backsheet. Since the first region is juxtaposed with the front of the wearer it should be superior in the handling of urine while the second region which is juxtaposed with the back of the wearer should be superior in the handling of low-viscosity fecal material. The first region has a PACORM value of less than 120 mg and the second region has a trans-topsheet capacity of at least 0.2 grams per square inch.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a disposable absorbent article having a first region and a second region comprising a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious backsheet joined to said topsheet, and an absorbent core positioned between said topsheet and said backsheet, characterized in that:<br>
said first region having a Post Acquisition Collagen Rewet Method value of less than 120 mg and said second region having a trans-topsheet capacity of at least 0.2 grams per square inch.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
While the specification concludes with claims pointing out and distinctly claiming the present invention, it is believed the same will be better understood by the following drawings taken in conjunction with the accompanying specification wherein like components are given the same reference number and:<br>
Figure" 1 is a top plan view, shown partially in cutaway, of a disposable absorbent<br>
article according to the present invention. Figure 2 is a schematic side elevational view of an apparatus which may be used to<br>

Method,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "absorbent article" refers to devices which absorb and contain body exudates, and, more specifically, refers to devices which are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the various exudates discharged from the body, The term "disposable" is used herein to describe absorbent articles which are not intended to be laundered or otherwise restored or reused as an absorbent article (i.e., they are intended to be discarded after a single use and, preferably, to be recycled, composted or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally compatible manner). A "unitary" absorbent article refers to absorbent articles which are formed of separate parts united together to form a coordinated entity so that they do not require separate manipulative parts like a separate holder and liner. A preferred embodiment of an absorbent article of the present invention is the unitary disposable absorbent article, diaper 20, shown in Figure 1. As used herein, the term "diaper" refers to an absorbent article generally worn by infants and adult incontinent persons and is worn about the lower torso of the wearer. The present invention is also applicable to other absorbent articles such as incontinence briefs, incontinence undergarments, absorbent inserts, diapers holders and liners, feminine hygiene garments, and the like,<br>
Figure 1 is a plan view of the diaper 20 of the present invention in its flat-out, uncontracted state (i.e., with elastic induced contraction pulled out) with portions of the structure being cut-away to more clearly show the construction of the diaper 20 and with the portion of the diaper 20 which faces or contacts the wearer, the inner surface, oriented towards the viewer. As shown in Figure 1, the diaper 20 preferably comprises a liquid pervious topsheet 24; a liquid impervious backsheet 26 joined with the topsheet 24; an absorbent core 28 intermediate£lhe topsheet 24 and the backsheet 26; and a fecal management member 30 positioned between the topsheet 24 and the absorbent core 28. The diaper 20 may further comprise elasticized side panels (not shown); elasticized leg<br><br>
cuffs (not shown); an elastic waist feature (not shown); and a fastening system with tape tabs generally multiply designated as 36.<br>
The diaper 20 is shown in Figure 1 to have a first region 31 juxtaposed with the front of the wearer while the diaper 20 is being worn and a second region 32 opposed to the first region 31 and juxtaposed with the back of the wearer while the diaper 20 is being worn, and a periphery which is defined by the outer edges of the diaper 20 in which the longitudinal edges are designated 33 and the end edges are designated 35. In Figure 1 the first region 31 is shown as extending from one end edge 35 to the lateral centerline 21 and the second region 32 is shown as extending from the opposing end edge 35 to the lateral centerline 21. For purposes of discussion, the lateral centerline 21 is shown as the boundary between the first region 31 and the second region 32 in Figure 1. However, the boundary between the first region 31 and the second region 32 may be positioned at other locations, for example closer to one of the respective end edges 35. The first region 31 being juxtaposed with the front of the wearer should be superior in the handling of urine. The second region being juxtaposed with the back of the wearer should be superior in the handling of fecal material, in particular low-viscosity fecal material.<br>
The inner surface of the diaper 20 comprises that portion of the diaper 20 which is adjacent to the wearer's body during use (i.e., the inner surface generally is formed by at least a portion of the topsheet 24 and other components joined to the topsheet 24). The outer surface comprises that portion of the diaper 20 which is positioned away from the wearer's body (i.e., the outer surface generally is formed by at least a portion of the backsheet 26 and other components joined to the backsheet 26) during use.<br>
Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the diaper 20 in which the topsheet 24 and the<br>
backsheet 26 have length and width dimensions generally larger than those of the<br>
absorbent core 28. The topsheet 24 and the backsheet 26 extend beyond the edges of the<br>
absorbent core 28 to thereby form the periphery of the diaper 20. While the topsheet 24,<br>
the backsheet 26, and the core 28 may be assembled in a variety of well known<br>
configurations, preferred diaper configurations are described generally in U.S. Patent<br>
3,860,003 entitled "Contractable Side Portions for Disposable Diaper" which issued to<br>
Kenneth B, Buell on January 14, 1975; and U.S. Patent 5,151,092, "Absorbent Article<br>
With Dynamic Elastic Waist Feature Having A Predisposed Resilient Flexural Hinge",<br>
issued to Kenneth B. Buell et al. September 29, 1992; each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.	-J*<br>
The absorbent core 28 may be any absorbent means which is generally compressible, conformable, non-irritating to the wearer's skin, and capable of absorbing and retaining liquids such as urine and other certain body exudates. As shown in Figure<br><br>
1, the absorbent core 28 has a garment surface, a body surface, side edges, and waist edges. The absorbent core 28 may be manufactured in a wide variety of sizes and shapes (e.g., rectangular, hourglass, "T"-shaped, asymmetric, etc.) and from a wide variety of liquid-absorbent materials commonly used in disposable diapers and other absorbent articles such as comminuted wood pulp which is generally referred to as airfelt. Examples of other suitable absorbent materials include creped cellulose wadding; meltblown polymers including coform; chemically stiffened, modified or cross-linked cellulosic fibers; tissue including tissue wraps and tissue laminates; absorbent foams; absorbent sponges; superabsorbent, polymers; absorbent gelling materials; or any equivalent material or combinations of materials.<br>
The configuration and construction of the absorbent core 28 may also be varied (e.g., the absorbent core 28 may have varying caliper zones, a hydrophilic gradient, a superabsorbent gradient, or lower average density and lower average basis weight acquisition zones; or may comprise one or more layers or structures), The total absorbent capacity of the absorbent core 28 should, however, be compatible with the design loading and the intended use of the diaper 20. Further, the size and absorbent capacity of the absorbent core 28 may be varied to accommodate wearers ranging from infants through adults,<br>
Exemplary absorbent structures for use as the absorbent core 28 are described in U.S. Patent 4,610,678 entitled "High-Density Absorbent Structures" issued to Weisman et al. on September 9, 1986; U.S. Patent 4,673,402 entitled "Absorbent Articles With Dual-Layered Cores" issued to Weisman et al. on June 16, 1987; U.S. Patent 4,888,231 entitled "Absorbent Core Having A Dusting Layer" issued to Angstadt on December 19, 1989; and U.S. Patent 4,834,735, entitled "High Density Absorbent Members Having Lower Density and Lower Basis Weight Acquisition Zones", issued to Alemany et al. on May 30,1989. Each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The backsheet 26 is positioned adjacent the garment surface of the absorbent core<br>
28 and is preferably joined thereto by attachment means (not shown) such as those well<br>
known in the art. As used herein, the term "joined" encompasses configurations whereby<br>
an element is directly secured to the other element by affixing the element directly to the<br>
other element, and configurations whereby the element is indirectly secured to the other<br>
element by affixing the element to intermediate member(s) which in turn are affixed to<br>
the other element.	<br>
For example, the backsheet 26 may be secured to the absorbent core 28 by a uniform continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned layer of adhesive, or an array of separate lines, spirals, or spots of adhesive. Adhesives which have been found to be<br><br>
satisfactory are manufactured by H. B. Fuller Company of St. Paul, Minnesota and marketed as HL-1258. The attachment means will preferably comprise an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive as is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,573,986 entitled "Disposable Waste-Containment Garment", which issued to Minetola et al, on March 4, 1986, more preferably several lines of adhesive filaments swirled into a spiral pattern such as is illustrated by the apparatus and methods shown in U.S. Patent 3,911,173 issued to Sprague, Jr. on October 7, 1975; U.S. Patent 4,785,996 issued to Ziecker, et al, on November 22, 1978; and U.S. Patent 4,842,666 issued to Werenicz on June 27, 1939. Each of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively, the attachment means may comprise heat bonds, pressure bonds, ultrasonic bonds, dynamic mechanical bonds, or any other suitable attachment means or combinations of these attachment means as are known in the art.<br>
The backsheet 26 is impervious to liquids (e.g., urine) and is preferably manufactured from a thin plastic film, although other flexible liquid impervious materials may also be used. As used herein, the term "flexible" refers to materials which are compliant and will readily conform to the general shape and contours of the human body.<br>
The backsheet 26 prevents the exudates absorbed and contained in the absorbent core 28 from wetting articles which contact the diaper 20 such as bedsheets and undergarments. The backsheet 26 may thus comprise a woven or nonwoven material, polymeric films such as thermoplastic films of polyethylene or polypropylene, or composite materials such as a film«coated nonwoven material. Preferably, the backsheet 26 is a thermoplastic film having a thickness of about 0.012 mm (0.5 mil) to about 0.051 mm (2.0 mils). Particularly preferred materials for the backsheet 26 include RR8220 blown films and RR5475 cast films as manufactured by Tredegar Industries, Inc. of Terre Haute, Indiana. The backsheet 26 is preferably embossed and/or matte finished to provide a more clothlike appearance, Further, the backsheet 26 may permit vapors to escape from the absorbent core 28 (i.e., be breathable) while still preventing exudates from passing through the backsheet 26.<br>
The topsheet 24 has a first or inner surface oriented toward the interior of the disposable diaper and an opposed second or outer surface oriented toward the skin of the wearer when the diaper is worn. The topsheet 24 is preferably joined to the backsheet 26 by means such as those well known in the art. Suitable attachment means are described above with respect to joining thejtecksheet 26 to the absorbent core 28. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the topsheet 24 and the backsheet 26 are joined directly to each other in the diaper periphery.<br><br>
There are a number of manufacturing techniques which may be used to manufacture the topsheet 24. For example, the topsheet 24 may be a nonwoven web of fibers spunbonded, carded, wet-laid, meltblown, hydroentangled, combinations or composite laminates of the above, or the like. Preferred topsheets 24 include a carded/carded composite, hydroentangled over a wire forming screen and thermally air-through bonded by means well known to those skilled in the nonwovens art and hydroentanglement of fibrous webs, Alternatively, apertured formed films, woven netting, and woven apertured netting may be suitable.<br>
As mentioned above, the second region 32 of the diaper 20 should be designed to be superior in the handling of low-viscosity fecal material as compared to the first region 31 which should be superior in the handling of urine. The trans-topsheet capacity reflects the diapers ability to handle low-viscosity fecal material. The second region 32 of the diaper 20, the region designed to handle low viscosity fecal material, should have a relatively high trans-topsheet capacity. Preferably, the second region 32 of the diaper 20 should have a relatively higher trans-topsheet capacity than the first region 31.<br>
There is an inverse relationship between the minimum trans-topsheet capacity necessary to handle low-viscosity fecal material and the surface area of the diaper 20 having this minimum capacity. As a larger percentage of the diaper 20 surface area has a trans-topsheet capacity sufficient to handle low-viscosity fecal material, the necessary trans-topsheet capacity diminishes.<br>
In any case, the second region 32 of the diaper 20 should have a trans-topsheet capacity of at least about 0.20 grams per square inch provided at least 30 square inches of the diaper 20 has such a trans-topsheet capacity and preferably at least 45 square inches of the diaper 20 has such a trans-topsheet capacity. It is believed that a minimum of 4 square inches of the diaper 20, which are closely registered with the anal opening, are necessary to handle low-viscosity fecal material. If such a relatively small region of the diaper 20 is provided, this region of the diaper 20 should have a trans-topsheet capacity of at least about 0.50 and preferably at least about 0,60 grams per square inch.<br>
The trade-off between trans-topsheet capacity and minimum surface area for a diaper 20 according to the present invention which is necessary to handle low-viscosity fecal material and the preferred surface area for a diaper 20 according to the present invention is illustrated in Table I below:<br>
 TABLE I<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Trans-topsheet capacity is measured by the following test. The apparatus 39 used for this measurement is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
A hollow stainless steel cylinder 40 mounted on a plate 42 is provided. The Stainless steel cylinder 40 has a height of 7.5 centimeters (2.95 inches), an inside diameter of 5.08 centimeters (2.00 inches) and an outside diameter of 6.3 centimeters (2.48 inches). The bottom of the cylinder 40 extends below the plate a distance of 3.5 millimeters, and has a lip with an annular thickness of 3.5 millimeters, The lip 43 prevents the fecal material analog, discussed below, from leaking outside the designated test area of the sample.<br>
Also provided is a weight 44 of 100.6 grams. The weight 44 is also cylindrically shaped and has a diameter of 5.08 centimeters (2.0 inches), so that the weight 44 fits tightly within the cylinder 40 but can freely slide throughout the hole in the cylinder 40, This arrangement provides a pressure of 49.57 kilograms per square meter (0.071 pounds per square inch) and a test area of 3.142 square inches. If desired, the weight 44 may have a handle 45 to allow it to be easily inserted into and removed from the cylinder 40,<br>
A sample 46 to be tested is provided. The sample 46 is preferably cut from the second region 32 of an existing diaper 20, but prophetically may be supplied in raw material form as a laminate of the various components of the diaper 20, The sample 46 is cut to a 10.16 by 10.16 centimeters (4 by 4 inch) square size. The sample 46 is taken from any area of the diaper 20 having the absorbent core 28 inside the square which defines the sample 46.<br>
If the sample 46 is cut from a diaper 20, the sample should include all layers and components of the diaper 20 from the topsheet 24 through and including the backsheet<br>
26. Care rculst be taken when removing the sample 46 from the diaper 20 not to destroy the sample 46 or cause unintended gross deformation of the topsheet 24. The topsheet 24, or its equivalent in the diaper 20, is removed from the balance of the sample 46. The sample 46 (without the first topsheet 24) is weighed to the nearest 0.01 grams. The topsheet 24 is then carefully returned to its original position in the sample 46, without being joined thereto. If difficulty is encountered in removing the sample 46 from the diaper 20, or in removing the topsheet 24 from the sample 46, the sample 46 and the surrounding portion of the diaper 20 may be frozen prior to or after cutting, Freezing may be accomplished using PHIOO-15 circuit refrigerant made by Philips ECG, Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts.<br>
The cylinder 40 is centered on the sample 46. A syringe having an opening of 5 to 6 millimeters dispenses 10 cubic centimeters of test fluid through the hole in the cylinder 40 onto the top of the sample 46. The test fluid is an analog formulated as described below. The 100.6 gram weight 44 is inserted through the hole in the cylinder 40 and gently placed on the test fluid for a period of 2 minutes.<br>
After 2 minutes the weight 44 and cylinder 40 are removed from the sample 46, The topsheet 24 is removed from the sample 46 by dragging the topsheet 24 parallel to the sample 46 and discarded. The remainder of the sample 46 is then reweighed. The trans-topsheet capacity is the increase in weight of all layers of the sample 46 underlying the topsheet 24 divided by the sample 46 test area of 3.142 square inches.<br>
The test fluid is an analog made by mixing 3 percent by -weight Carbopol 941 available from the B. F. Goodrich Corporation of Brecksville, Ohio, or an equivalent acrylic polymer, in distilled water for five minutes using a hand held electric mixer. The mixture is allowed to equilibrate for at least 12 hours and used for the trans-topsheet capacity test within 72 hours.<br>
The second region 32 diaper 20 according to the present invention preferably provides a trans-topsheet capacity, as measured by the foregoing test, of at least 0.20 grams per square inch, more preferably at least 0,30 grams per square inch, even more preferably at least 0.40 grams per square inch, still more preferably at least 0.50 grams per square inch, and most preferably at least 0.60 grams per square inch.<br>
The topsheet 24 may allow penetration of the fecal material to achieve the trans-topsheet capacities set forth in Table I, by having apertures with an effective aperture size of at least 0.2 sflftare millimeters, and preferably at least 0.3 square millimeters. Effective apertures are those which have a gray level of 18 or less on a standard gray level scale of 0-255, under the image acquisition parameters described below.<br>
The topsheet 24 within the second region 32 preferably has an effective open area of at least 15 percent, more preferably the topsheet has an effective open area of at least 20 percent, even more preferably, the topsheet has an effective open area of at least 25 percent, and most preferably the topsheet has an effective open area of at least 30 percent.<br>
The effective aperture size and effective open area are determined by the following procedure using the image analysis described below. The procedure has three principal steps: image acquisition, i.e., obtaining representative images of areas on the surface of the topsheet 24; image measurement, i.e., measuring the percentage open area of an image and of individual apertures and their perimeters; and data analysis, i.e., exporting the percentage open area, individual aperture area, and perimeter measurements to a spreadsheet where frequency distributions, sum of area distributions, and hydraulic radius computations are made.<br>
An image analysis system having a frame grabber board, microscope, camera and image analysis software is utilized. A model DT2855 frame grabber board available from Data Translation of Marlboro, Mass, is provided. A VH5900 monitor microscope, a video camera, having aVH50 lens with a contact type illumination head available from the Keyence Company of Fair Lawn, N,J. are also provided and used to acquire an image to be saved to computer file. The Keyence microscope acquires the image and the frame grabber board converts the analog signal of this image into computer readable digital format. The image is saved to computer file and measured using suitable software such as the Optimas Image Analysis software, version 3.1, available from the BioScan Company of Edmaons, Wash. In order to use the Optimas Image Analysis software, the computer should have Windows software, version 3.0 or later, available from the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash. And also have a CPU at least equivalent to the Intel 80386. Any suitable desk top PC may be used, with a 486 DX33 type PC having been found to be particularly suitable. Images being saved to and recalled from file were displayed on a Sony Trinitron monitor mode! PVM-1343MO with a final display magnification of about 50X.<br>
The image acquisition step, noted above requires 10 different regions from a representative topsheet 24 sample of a particular type of diaper 20 or from sample material to be tested. Each region is rectangular, measuring about 5.8 millimeters by 4.2 millimeters. The sample is placed on a black mat board to increase the contrast between the apertures and the portion of the sample which defines the apertures. The mean gray level and standard deviation of the black mat board were 16 and 4, respectively.<br>
Images are acquired with room lights off using the Keyence monitor microscope mounted on a copystand directly above the sample. The Keyence light source<br>
illuminating the sample is adjusted and monitored with the Optimas software to measure die mean gray level and standard deviation of a 0.3 density wedge on a Kodak Gray Scale available from Eastman Kodak Company of Rochester, New York. The control of Keyence light source is adjusted so that the mean gray level of the illuminated wedge is 111 + 1 and the standard deviation is 10 ± I. All images were acquired during a single time period, and the Keyence light source is monitored by measuring the mean gray level and standard deviation of the wedge throughout the image acquisition process.<br>
In measuring an individual aperture, only the effective aperture size is of interest. Measuring the effective aperture size quantifies the aperture size intended to contribute to the porosity of the topsheet 24, and account for contributions of fibers and fiber bundles which traverse an area intended to be an aperture. An effective aperture is any hole through the topsheet 24 having a gray level less than or equal to 18 using image acquisition parameters as described herein. Thus, an intended aperture may be divided into plural effective apertures by traverse fibers.<br>
The image analysis software is calibrated in millimeters by a ruler image acquired from the sample images. A 3 by 3 pixel averaging filter found in the Optimas 3.1 Image menu is applied to each saved image to reduce noise. The apertures are detected in the gray level range of 0 through 18. An aperture which is not fully contained within the 5.8 by 4.2 viewing area is not considered in the individual area and perimeter measurements. Therefore, area and perimeter averages and distributions are not affected by apertures which are not wholly contained within the field of view.<br>
However, individual apertures which could not be fully viewed in the image are included in the percentage open area calculation. This difference occurs because the percent open area is simply the image of pixel ratios from 0 through 18 to the total number of pixels in the image, Areas having a gray level 19 or greater were not counted in the open area calculation.<br>
The percentage open area for the average of 10 images for each topsheet 24 is<br>
measured using the Optimas Image Analysis software. The percentage open area is<br>
defined as the ratio of the number of pixels having a gray level from 0 through 18 to the<br>
total number of pixels for the image. The percentage open area is measured for each<br>
image representing one particular region from a topsheet sample. The percentage open<br>
area from each of the 10 individual images is then averaged to yield a percentage open<br>
area for the entire sample,	<br>
The data analysis is conducted by an Excel spreadsheet, also available from the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington. The Excel spreadsheet organized the percentage open area, aperture area, and aperture perimeter measurements obtained from<br>
the Optimas" software. Sample averages and standard deviations, size and frequency distributions of individual aperture areas and hydraulic radius computations (area divided by perimeter) for individual apertures are obtained using the spreadsheet<br>
" Distributions of individual aperture area are also computed using the Excel spreadsheet. The apertures are sorted into bins of certain size ranges. The number of aperture areas falling into certain size ranges of interest is determined as well as the sum of the areas within each range. The ranges are set in increments of 0.05 square millimeters, These areas are expressed as a percentage of the total open area of the sample. The frequency and sum of. the area distributions are obtained by combining individual aperture measurements from all 10 images for each sample.<br>
The fecal management member 30 may either be absorbent or nonabsorbent. A material suitable for an absorbent fecal management member 30 is a cellulosic fibrous structure, such as paper. The cellulosic fibrous structure may be made by having a continuous high basis weight network with discrete regions of low basis weight, or even discrete apertures having a zero basis weight. In a diaper 20 having such a fecal management member 30, the low-viscosity fecal material passes through the topsheet 24 and resides on the fecal management member 30, The low basis weight discrete regions or apertures form cells which immobilize the low-viscosity fecal material.<br>
Once the low-viscosity fecal material is immobilized in this position, it does not return to soil or irritate the skin of the wearer. Furthermore, the low viscosity fecal material can be dewatered into separate components by the capillary action of the more fluid components of the low-viscosity fecal material into the cellulosic fibrous material of the fecal management member 30.<br>
In another embodiment, a nonabsorbent fecal management member 30 may be provided. If a nonabsorbent fecal management member 30 is selected, it may be provided in the form of an apertuied formed film meeting the caliper requirements described above. A suitable formed film is available from Tredegar Corporation of Terre Haute, Indiana under the designation X5790.<br>
Of course, if the fecal management member 30 is nonabsorbent, it must be associated with a core 28 which has adequate capacity to absorb and retain the fluids deposited thereon.<br>
Figure 3 is another embodiment of a fecal management member 30. Generally the fecal management member 30 uSa sheet of loop material 118 having a backing 120 having front and rear major surfaces 123 and 124, and a multiplicity of longitudinally oriented fibers in a specially formed sheet of fibers 126 having anchor generally non-deformed anchor portions 127 bonded by being embedded in the backing layer 120 at<br>
spaced elongate generally parallel bonding locations 128 that are continuous in one direction along the front surface 123 with arcuate portions 130 of the sheet of fibers 126 projecting from the front surface 123 of the backing layer 120 between the bonding locations 128 in continuous rows also extending transversely across the sheet of loop material 118. The arcuate portions 130 of the sheet of fibers 126 have a generally uniform height from the backing layer 120 of greater than about 0.5 millimeters and preferably greater than about 1.0 millimeters, the height of the formed sheet of fibers 126 is at least one third, and preferably one half to one and one half times the distance between the bonding locations 128, the individual fibers in the sheet of fibers 126 are less than 25 denier (preferably in the range of 1 to 10 denier) in size, and the sheet of fibers 126 without the backing 120 has a basis weight in the range of 5 to 300 grams per square mete; (and preferably in the range of 15 to 100 grams per square meter) measured along the first surface 123 to provide sufficient open area between the fibers in the sheet of fibers 126 along the arcuate portions 130 (i.e., between about 10 and 90 percent open area) to afford ready penetration of fecal material into the individual fibers along the arcuate portions 130.<br>
Suitable materials for use as the backing 120 include but are not limited to thermoplastic films, porous films, apertured films, apertured formed films, unapettured formed films, nonwoven webs, breathable materials, such as breathable films, including but not limited to microporous films, apertured nonwoven webs and the like. The backing 120 is preferably a relatively thin layer having a thickness in the range of about 0,00125 to 0.025 centimeters.<br>
The fibers in the sheet of fibers 126 can be disposed in various directions with rsspect to the parallel bonding locations 128 and may or may not be bonded together at crossover points in the arcuate portions 130; can be disposed in various directions with respect to the parallel bonding locations 128 with the majority of the fibers in the sheet of fibers 126 (i.e., over 80 or 90 percent) extending in directions at about a right angle to the bonding locations 128; or all of the individual fibers in the sheet of fibers 126 can extend in directions generally at right angles to the spaced generally parallel bonding locations 128.<br>
To be the most effective in the handling of low-viscosity fecal material the fecal management member must have a lofted open structure. One key component of this equation is the height of the arcjate portions 130 of the sheet of fibers 126 from the backing 120. As mentioned above the arcuate portions 130 of the sheet of fibers 126 have a generally uniform height from the backing 120 of greater than about 0.5 millimeters and preferably greater than about 1.0 millimeters. While even greater heights<br><br>
would provide excellent handling of low-viscosity fecal material, e.g., heights of 5.0 centimeters, such heights would create unwanted bulk in the diaper which may cause discomfort for the wearer.<br>
Another key component is the resiliency of the fecal management member 30, more particularly the resiliency of the sheet of fibers 126. In order to remain open, the sheet of fibers 126 must have a sufficient resiliency to withstand the forces of packaging and those applied by the wearer. Preferably, the sheet of fibers 126 has a resiliency of at least 50% after 30 seconds under an applied force of 100g/cm2, more preferably, the sheet of fibers 126 has a resiliency of at least 75% after 30 seconds under an applied force of 100g/cm2, most preferably, the sheet of fibers 126 has a resiliency of at least 85% after 30 seconds under an applied force of I00g/cm2.<br>
As mentioned above, the trans-topsheet capacity reflects the diapers ability to handle Ipw-viscosity fecal material. Similarly, the Post acquisition collagen rewet method (PACORM) reflects the diapers ability to handle urine. The first region 31 of the diaper 20, the region designed to handle urine, should have a relatively low PACORM. Preferably, the first region 31 of the diaper 20 should have a relatively lower PACORM than the second region 32.<br>
The first region 21 of the diaper 20 preferably has a PACORM value of less than 120 mg, more preferably, a PACORM value of less than 100 mg, and most preferably, a PACORM value of less than 80 mg.<br>
Acquisition Test<br>
This test should be carried out at about 22 +/- 2°C and at 35+A 15% relative humidity. The synthetic urine used in these test methods is commonly known as Jayco SynUrine and is available from Jayco Pharmaceuticals Company of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The formula for the synthetic urine is: 2,0 g/1 of KC1; 2.0 g/1 of Na2SO4; 0.85 g/1 of (NH4)H2P04; 0.15 g/1 (NH4)H2PO4; 0.19 g/1 of CaCl2; ad 0,23 g/1 of MgCl2- AH of the chemicals are of reagent grade. The pH of the synthetic Urine is in the range of 6.0 to 6.4.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, an absorbent structure (410) is loaded with a 75 ml gush of synthetic urine at a rate of 15 ml/s using a pump (Model 7520-00, supplied by Cole Parmer Instruments., Chicago, U.S.A.), from a height of 5 cm above the sample surface. The time to absorb the urine is rg£brded by a timer. The gush is repeated at precisely 5 minute gush intervals until the article is sufficiently loaded. Current test data are generated by loading four times.<br>
The test sample, which can be a complete absorbent article or an absorbent structure comprising an absorbent core, a topsheet, and a backsheet, is arranged to lie flat on a foam platform 411 within a perspex box (only base 412 of which is shown). A perspex plate 413 having a 5 cm diameter opening in its middle is placed on top of the sample on the loading zone of the structure. Synthetic urine is introduced to the sample through a cylinder 414 fitted, and glued into the opening, Electrodes 415 are located on the lowest surface of the plate, in contact with the surface of the absorbent structure 410. The electrodes are connected to the timer. Loads 416 are placed on top of the plate to simulate, for example a baby's weight, A pressure of about 50g cm-2 (0.7psi) is achieved by positioning weights 416, e.g. for the commonly available MAXI size 20 kg.<br>
As test fluid is introduced into the cylinder it typically builds up on top of the absorbent structure thereby completing an electrical circuit between the electrodes. The test fluid is transported from the pump to the test assembly by means of a tubing of about 8 mm diameter, which is kept filled with test fluid. Thus the fluid starts to leave the tubing essentially at the same time the pump starts operating. At this time, also the timer is started, and the timer is stopped when the absorbent structure has absorbed the gush of urine, and the electrical contact between the electrodes is broken.<br>
The acquisition rate is defined as the gush volume absorbed (ml) per unit time(s). The acquisition rate is calculated for each gush introduced into the sample, Of particular interest in view of the current invention are the first and the last of the four gushes.<br>
This test is primarily designed to evaluate products generally referred to as MAXI size products for a design capacity of about 300 ml, and having a respective Ultimate Storage Capacity of about 300 ml to 400 ml. If products with significantly different capacities should be evaluated (such as can be envisaged for adult incontinence products or for smaller babies), the settings in particular of the fluid volume per gush should be adjusted appropriately to about 20% of the total article design capacity, and the deviation from the standard test protocol should be recorded.<br>
Post Acquisition Collagen Rewet Method (refer to Fig. 4)<br>
Before executing the test, the collagen film as purchased from NATURIN GmbH, Weinhein, Germany, under the designation of COFFI and at a basis weight of about 28g/m2 is prepared by being cut into sheets of 90 mm diameter e.g. by using a sample cutter device, and by equilibrating the film in the controlled environment of the test room (see above) for at least 12 hours geezers are to be used for all handling of the collagen film).<br>
At leist 5 minutes, but not more than 6 minutes after the last gush of the above acquisition test is absorbed, the cover plate and weights are removed, and the test sample (520) is carefully placed flat on a lab bench.<br>
4 sheets of the precut and equilibrated collagen material (510) are weighed with at least one milligram accuracy, and then positioned centred onto the loading point of the article, and covered by perspex plate (530) of 90 mm diameter, and about 20 mm thickness. A weight (540) of 15 kg is carefully added (also centred). After 30 +/- 2 seconds the weight and perspex plate are carefully removed again, and the collagen films are reweighed.<br>
The Post Acquisition Collagen Rewet Method result is the moisture pick up of the collagen film, expressed in mg.<br>
It should be noted further, that this testing protocol can be adjusted easily according to specific product types, such as different baby diaper sizes, or adult incontinence articles, or catamenial articles, or by the variation in the type and amount of loading fluid, the amount and size of the absorbent material, or by variations in the applicable pressure. Having once defined these relevant parameters, such modifications will be obvious to one skilled in the art. When considering the results from the adjusted test protocol the products can easily be optimising these identified relevant parameter such as in a designed experiment according to standard statistical methods with realistic in use boundary conditions.<br>
In one embodiment, only the portion of the topsheet 24 within the second region 32 comprises a skin care composition. While the specific composition is not the critical factor in achieving improved skin condition, it is apparent that the composition must provide either a protective, nonocclusive function (e.g., a relatively liquid impervious but vapor pervious barrier) to avoid skin hyperhydration and skin exposure to materials contained in body exudates, or it must contain agents that deliver, either directly or indirectly, skin care benefits. For example, indirect benefits include improved removal of skin irritants such as feces or urine. The composition may be in a variety of forms, including, but not limited to, emulsions, lotions, creams, ointments, salves, powders, suspensions, encapsulations, gels, and the like.<br>
As used herein, the term "effective amount of a skin care composition" refers to an amount of a particular composition which, when applied or migrated to one or more of the wearer-contacting surface(s) o£fcn absorbent article(s), will be effective in providing a protective barrier and/or delivering a skin care benefit when delivered via absorbent articles over time. Of course, the effective amount of composition applied to the article will depend, to a large extent, on the particular composition used. Nonetheless, the<br>
quantity of the composition on at least a portion of the wearer-contacting surface of the absorbent article will preferably range from about 0.05 mg/in2 (0,0078 mg/cm2) to about 80 mg/in2 (12.4 mg/cm2), more preferably from about 1 mg/in2 (0.16 mg/cm2) to about 40 mg/in2 (6.20 mg/cm2), still more preferably from about 4 mg/in2 (0.62 mg/cm2) to about 26 mg/in2 (4.03mg/cm2). These ranges are by way of illustration only and the skilled artisan will recognize that the nature of the composition will dictate the level that must be applied to achieve the desired skin benefits, and that such levels are ascertainable by routine experimentation in light of the present disclosure.<br>
While the level of skin care composition applied to the absorbent article is an important aspect of the present methods, more important is the amount of composition transferred to the wearer's skin during use of one or more treated articles. Though the requisite level delivered to the skin to provide the desired skin benefits will depend to some degree on the nature of the composition employed, Applicants have found that relatively low levels may be delivered while still providing the desired skin effects. This is particularly true for preferred compositions.<br>
Another benefit of the present method is the controlled application of the skin care composition to deliver the low but effective levels of composition required. This is in contrast to typically sporadic manual application of skin care agents, where the caregiver/user often applies significantly greater levels of material than are needed. Excessive materials added manually may adversely impact the fluid handling properties of the absorbent article, as a result of transfer from the skin to the article. Indeed, for certain materials, such as petrolatum, the levels applied manually may actually result in an occlusive effect, thereby compromising the skin. A benefit of the present methods is providing a barrier to surface moisture while avoiding occlusion of the skin (i.e., maintaining skin breathability). Thus, the present methods, which allow controlled composition delivery throughout the wear period, allow transfer of optimal levels of the composition to the skin to improve skin condition.<br>
With regard to the level of skin care composition that is transferred to the wearer during use of one treated absorbent article worn for a period of about 3 hours (a typical daytime wear time), preferred is where at least about 0.01 mg/in2 (0.0016 mg/cm2), more preferably at least about 0.05 mg/in2 (0.0078 rng/cm2), still more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/in2 (0.016 mg/cm2), of the composition is transferred to the skin over a three hour wear period. Typically, the amount of composition delivered by one treated article will be from about 0.01 mg/in2 (0.0016 mg/cm2) to about 5 mg/in2 (0.78 mg/cm2), more preferably from about 0.05 mg/in2 (0.0078 mg/cm2) to about 3 mg/in2 (0.47 mg/cm2),<br>
still more preferably from about 0.1 mg/in2 (0.016 mg/cm2) to about 2 mg/in2 (0.31 mg/cm2), over a three hour wear period.<br>
For continual use of treated articles (in other words, changes occur in accordance with normal use patterns, which typically include changes every 3 to 4 hours during the day and a fresh article before overnight sleep) such as for a period of 24 hours, it will be preferred that at least about 0.03 mg/in2 (0.0047 mg/cm2), more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/in2 (0.016 mg/cm2), still more preferably at least about 0.3 mg/in2 (0.047 mg/cm2), of the composition is transferred to the wearer's skin over the 24 hour period. Typically, the amount of composition delivered after a period of 24 hours where treated articles are applied at each change, will be from about 0.03 mg/in2 (0,0047 mg/cm2) to about 18 mg/in2 (2.79 mg/cm2), more typically from about 0.1 mg/in2 (0.016 mg/cm2) to about 10 mg/in2 (1,55 mg/cm2), still more typically from about 0.3 mg/in2 (0.047 mg/cm2) to about 6 mg/in2 (0.93 mg/cm2).<br>
It will be recognized that of the numerous materials useful in the skin care compositions delivered to skin in accordance with the present methods, those that have been deemed safe and effective skin care agents are logical materials for use herein. Such materials include Category I actives as defined by the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Tentative Final Monograph on Skin Protectant Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use, which presently include: alantoin, aluminum, hydroxide gel, calamine, cocoa butter, dimethicone, cod liver oil (in combination), glycerine, kaolin, petrolatum, lanolin, mineral oil, shark liver oil, white petrolatum, talc, topical starch, zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and the like. Other potentially useful materials are Category III actives as defined by the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration's Tentative Final Monograph on Skin Protectant Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use tentative final monograph on skin protectant drug products for over-the-counter human use, which presently include: live yeast cell derivatives, aldioxa, aluminum acetate, microporous cellulose, cholecalciferol, colloidal oatmeal, cysteine hydrochloride, dexpanthanol, Peruvian balsam oil, protein hydrolysates, racemethionine, sodium bicarbonate, Vitamin A, and the like.<br>
Many of the FDA monographed skin care ingredients are currently utilized in commercially available skin care products, such as A and D® Ointment, Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly, Desitin® Diaper Rash Ointment and Daily Care Ointment, Gold Bond® Medicated Baby Powder, AquapKbr® Healing Ointment, Baby Magic® Baby Lotion, Johnson's Ultra Sensitive® Baby Cream, Johnson's baby lotion, lip balms, etc. These commercial products may be applied to absorbent articles to create treated articles for use<br><br>
in the present methods, either with or without modification of the product to facilitate delivery via this novel method.<br>
As will be discussed hereinafter, the skin care compositions useful in the methods of the present invention preferably, though not necessarily, have a melting profile such that they are relatively immobile and localized on the wearer-contacting surface of the article at room temperature, are readily transferable to the wearer at body temperature, and yet are not completely liquid under extreme storage conditions. Preferably, the compositions are easily transferable to the skin by way of normal contact, wearer motion, and/or body heat, Because the composition preferably is substantially immobilized on the article's wearer-contacting surface, relatively low levels of composition are needed to impart the desired skin care benefits. In addition, special barrier or wrapping materials may be unnecessary in packaging the treated articles useful in the methods of the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the skin care compositions useful herein are solid, or more often semi-solid, a: 20°C, i.e. at ambient temperatures. By "semisolid" is meant that the composition has a theology typical of pseudoplastic or plastic liquids. When no shear is applied, the compositions can have the appearance of a semi-solid but can be made to flow as the shear rate is increased, This is due to the fact that, while the composition contains primarily solid components, it also includes some minor liquid components. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention have a zero shear viscosity between about 1.0 X 106 centipoise and about 1.0 X 10&amp;, More preferably, the zero shear viscosity is between about 5.0 X 10^ centipoise and about 5.0 X 107 centipoise. As used herein the term "zero shear viscosity" refers to a viscosity measured at very low shear rates (e.g., 1.0 sec'l) using plate and cone viscometer (a suitable instrument is available from TA Instruments of New Castle, DE as model number CSL 100). One of skill in the art will recognize means other than high melting point components (as discussed below) can be used to provide comparable viscosities measured for such compositions comprising such means can be measured by extrapolating a plot of viscosity vs. shear rate for such compositions to a shear rate of zero at a temperature of about 20°C.<br>
Preferred compositions are at least semi-solid at room temperature to minimize composition migration. In addition, the compositions preferably have a final melting point (100% liquid) above potential "stressful" storage conditions that can be greater than 45*0 (e.g., warehouse in Angina, car trunk in Florida, etc.). Representative compositions having these melt characteristics are described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,643,588 (Roe et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,607,760 (Roe et al.), U.S. Patent No. 5,609,587,<br>
and U.S. Patent No, 5,635,191, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Specifically, preferred compositions will have the following melt profile:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
By being solid or semisolid at ambient temperatures, preferred compositions do not have a tendency to flow and migrate to a significant degree to undesired locations of the article to which they are applied. This means less skin care composition is required for imparting desirable therapeutic, protective or conditioning benefits.<br>
To enhance immobility of preferred compositions, the viscosity of the formulated compositions should be as high as possible to prevent flow within the article to undesired location. Unfortunately, in some instances, higher viscosities may inhibit transfer of composition to the wearer's skin. Therefore, a balance should be achieved so the viscosities are high enough to keep the compositions localized on the surface of the article, but not so high as to impede transfer to the wearer's skin. Suitable viscosities for the compositions will typically range from about 5 to about 500 centipoise, preferably from about 5 to about 300 centipoise, more preferably from about 5 to about 100 centipoise, measured at 60_C using a rotational viscometer (a suitable viscometer is available from Lab Line Instruments, Inc. of Melrose Park, IL as Model 4537). The viscometer is operated at 60 rpm using a number 2 spindle,<br>
For compositions designed to provide a skin smoothness benefit, a useful active ingredient in these compositions is one or more skin protectants or emollients. As used herein, the term "emollient" is a material that protects against wetness or irritation, softens, soothes, supples, coats, lubricates, moisturizes, protects and/or cleanses the skin. (It will be recognized that several of the monographed actives listed above are "emollients", as that term is used herein.) In a preferred embodiment, these emollients will have either a plastic or liquid consistency at ambient temperatures, i.e., 20°C, This particular emollient consistency allows the composition to impart a soft, lubricious, lotion-like feel,<br>
Representative emollients useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, emollients that are petroleum-based; polyol polyesters; sucrose ester fatty<br>
acids; polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof; humectants; fatty acid ester type; alkyl ethoxylate type; fatty acid ester ethoxylates; fatty alcohol type; polysiloxane type; propylene glycol and derivatives thereof; glycerine and derivatives thereof, including giyceride, acetoglycerides, and ethoxylated glycerides of C12-C28 fatty acids; triethylene glycol and derivatives thereof; spermaceti or other waxes; fatty acids; fatty alcohol ethers, particularly those having from 12 to 28 carbon atoms in their fatty chain, such as stearic acid; propoxylated fatty alcohols; other fatty esters of polyhydroxy alcohols; lanolin and its derivatives; kaolin and its derivatives; any of the monographed skin care agents listed above; or mixtures of these emollients. Suitable petroleum-based emollients include those hydrocarbons, or mixtures of hydrocarbons, having chain lengths of from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petroleum based hydrocarbons having these chain lengths include mineral oil (also known as "liquid petrolatum") and petrolatum (also known as "mineral wax," "petroleum jelly" and "mineral jelly"). Mineral oil usually refers to less viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 20 carbon atoms. Petrolatum usually refers to more viscous mixtures of hydrocarbons having from 16 to 32 carbon atoms. Petrolatum and mineral oil are particularly preferred emollients for compositions of the present invention.<br>
Suitable fatty acid ester type emollients include those derived from CC12-C28 fatty acids, preferably C16-C22 saturated fatty acids, and short chain (C1-C8, preferably C1-C3) monohydric alcohols. Representative examples of such esters include methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, isopropyl laurate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, ethylhexyl palmitate and mixtures thereof. Suitable fatty acid ester emollients can also be derived from esters of longer chain fatty alcohols (C12-C28, preferably C12-C16) and shorter chain fatty acids e.g., lactic acid, such as lauryl lactate and cetyl lactate.<br>
Suitable alkyl ethoxylate type emollients include C12-C22 fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 2 to about 30. Preferably, the fatty alcohol ethoxylate emollient is selected from the group consisting of lauryl, cetyl, and stearyl ethoxylates, and mixtures thereof, having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 2 to about 23. Representative examples of such alkyl ethoxylates include laureth-3 (a lauryl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 3), laureth-23 (a lauiyl ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 23), ceteth-10 (a cetyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10) and steareth-i0s(a stearyl alcohol ethoxylate having an average degree of ethoxylation of 10). When employed, these alkyl ethoxylate emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight<br>
ratio of alkyl ethoxylate emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1 ;2 to about 1:4.<br>
Suitable fatty alcohol type emollients include C12-C22 fatty alcohols, preferably C16-C18 fatty alcohols. Representative examples include cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. When employed, these fatty alcohol emollients are typically used in combination with the petroleum-based emollients, such as petrolatum, at a weight ratio of fatty alcohol emollient to petroleum-based emollient of from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:2.<br>
Other suitable types of emollients for use herein include polysiloxane compounds. In general, suitable polysiloxane materials for use in the present invention include those having monomeric siloxane units of the following structure:<br>
(Formual Removed)<br>
wherein, Rl and R2, for each independent siloxane monomeric unit can each independently be hydrogen or any alkyl, aryl, alkenyi, alkaryl, arakyl, cycloalkyl, halogenated hydrocarbon, or other radical. Any of such radicals can be substituted or unsubstituted. R1 and R2 radicals of any particular monomeric unit may differ from the corresponding functionalities of the next adjoining monomeric unit. Additionally, the polysiloxane can be either a straight chain, a branched chain or have a cyclic structure. The radicals R* and R^ can additionally independently be other silaceous functionalities such as, but not limited to siloxanes, polysiloxanes, silanes, and polysilanes. The radicals Rl and R^ may contain any of a variety of organic functionalities including, for example, alcohol, carboxylic acid, phenyl, and amine functionalities.<br>
Exemplary alkyl radicals are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, octadecyl, and the like. Exemplary alkenyi radicals are vinyl, ailyl, and the like. Exemplary aryl radicals are phenyl, diphenyl, naphthyl, and the like. Exemplary aikaryl radicals are toyl, xylyl, ethylphenyl, and the like. Exemplary aralkyl radicals are benzyl, alpha-phenylethyl, beta-phenylethyl, alpha-phenylbutyl, and the like. Exemplary cycloalkyl radicals are cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. Exemplary halogenated hydrocarbon radicals are chloromethyl, bromoethyl, tetrafluorethyl, fluorethyl, trifluorethyl, trifluorotlyl, hexafluoroxylyl, and the like.<br>
Viscosity of polysiloxanes useful may vary as widely as the viscosity of polysiloxanes in general vary, so long as the polysiloxane is flowable or can be made to be flowable for application to the article. This includes, but is not limited to, viscosity as<br>
low as 5 ceritistokes (at 37_C as measured by a glass viscometer) to about 20,000,000 centistokes. Preferably the polysiloxanes have a viscosity at 37_C ranging from about 5 to about 5,000 centistokes, more preferably from about 5 to about 2,000 centistokes, most preferably from about 100 to about 1000 centistokes. High viscosity polysiloxanes which themselves are resistant to flowing can be effectively deposited upon the article by such methods as, for example, emulsifying the polysiloxane in surfactant or providing the polysiloxane in solution with the aid of a solvent, such as hexane, listed for exemplary purposes only. Particular methods for applying polysiloxane emollients to absorbent articles are discussed in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Preferred polysiloxanes compounds for use in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,059,282 (Ampulski et al), issued October 22,1991, which is incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred polysiloxane compounds for use as emollients in the compositions of the present invention include phenyl-fiinctional polymethylsiloxane compounds (e.g., Dow Coming 556 Cosmetic-Grade Fluid: polyphenylmethylsiloxane) and cetyl or stearyl functionalized dirnethicones such as Dow 2502 and Dow 2503 polysiloxane liquids, respectively. In addition to such substitution with phenyl-functional or alkyl groups, effective substitution may be made with amino, carboxyt, hydroxyl, ether, polyether, aldehyde, ketone, amide, ester, and thiol groups. Of these effective substituent groups, the family of groups comprising phenyl, amino, alkyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups are more preferred than the others; and phenyl-functional groups are most preferred.<br>
Suitable humectants include glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol, trihydroxy stearin, and the like.<br>
When present, the amount of emollient that can be included in the composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the particular emollient involved, the lotion-like benefits desired, the other ^components in the composition and like factors. The composition will comprise from 0 to about 100%, by total weight, of the emollient. Preferably, the composition will comprise from about 10 to about 95%, more preferably from about 20 to about 80%, and most preferably from about 40 to about 75%, by weight, of the emollient.<br>
Another optional, preferred component of the therapeutic/skin protective/skin conditioning compositions usefu] in the methods of the present invention is an agent capable of immobilizing the composition (including the preferred emollient and/or other skin conditioning/therapeutic/protective agents) in the desired location in or on the treated article. Because certain of the preferred emollients in the composition have a plastic or liquid consistency at 20°C, they tend to flow or migrate, even when subjected to modest<br>
shear. Whefl applied to a wearer-contacting surface or other location of an absorbent article, especially in a melted or molten state, the emollient will not remain primarily in or on the treated region. Instead, the emollient will tend to migrate and flow to undesired regions of the article.<br>
Specifically, if the emollient migrates into the interior of the article, it can cause undesired effects on the absorbency of the article core due to the hydrophobic characteristics of many of the emollients and other skin conditioning agents used in the compositions useful in the methods of the present invention, It also means that much more emollient has to be applied to the article to get the desired skin smoothness benefits. Increasing the level of emollient not only increases the cost, but also exacerbates the undesirable effect on the absorbency of the article's core and undesired transfer of composition during processing/converting of the treated articles.<br>
The immobilizing agent counteracts this tendency of the emollient to migrate or flow by keeping the emollient primarily localized on the surface or in the region of the article to which the composition is applied. This is believed to be due, in part, to the fact that the immobilizing agent raises the melting point and/or viscosity of the composition above that of the emollient. Since the immobilizing agent is preferably miscible with the emollient (or solubilized in the emollient with the aid of an appropriate emulsifier or dispersed therein), it entraps the emollient on the surface of the article's wearer contacting surface or in the region to which it is applied.<br>
It is also advantageous to "lock" the immobilizing agent on.the wearer contacting surface or the region of the article to which it is applied. This can be accomplished by using immobilizing agents which quickly set up (i.e., solidify) upon application to the article. In addition, outside cooling of the treated article via blowers, fans, cold rolls, etc. can speed up crystallization of the immobilizing agent.<br>
In addition to being miscible with (or solubilized in) the emollient, the immobilizing agent will preferably have a melting profile that will provide a composition that is solid or semisolid at ambient temperature. In this regard, preferred immobilizing agents will have a melting point of at least about 35°C. This is so the immobilizing agent itself will not have a tendency to migrate or flow. Preferred immobilizing agents will have melting points of at least about 40_C. Typically, the immobilizing agent will have a melting point in the range of from about 50__ to about 150_C.<br>
When utilized, immobilizing agents useful herein can be selected from any of a number of agents, so long as the preferred properties of the skin care composition provide the skin benefits described herein. Preferred immobilizing agents will comprise a member selected from the group consisting of C14-C22 fatty alcohols, C12-C22 fatty<br>
acids, and C12-C22 fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from 2 to about 30, and mixtures thereof. Preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty alcohols, most preferably crystalline high melting materials selected from the group consisting of cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof (The linear structure of these materials can speed up solidification on the treated absorbent article,) Mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol are particularly preferred. Other preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty acids, most preferably selected from the group consisting of palmitic acid, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof. Mixtures of palmitic acid and stearic acid are particularly preferred. Still other preferred immobilizing agents include C16-C18 fatty alcohol ethoxylates having an average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 5 to about 20. Preferably, the fatty alcohols, fatty acids and fatty alcohols are linear, Importantly, these preferred immobilizing agents such as the C16-C18 fatty alcohols increase the rate of crystallization of the composition causing the composition to crystallize rapidly onto the surface of the substrate.<br>
Other types of ingredients that can be used as immobilizing agents, either alone, or in combination with the above-mentioned immobilizing agents, include waxes such as caraauba, ozokerite, beeswax, candelilla, paraffin, ceresin, esparto, ouricuri, rezowax, isoparaffin, and other known mined and mineral waxes. The high melt point of these materials can help immobilize the composition on the desired surface or location on the article, Additionally microcrystalline waxes are effective immobilizing agents. Macrocrystalline waxes can aid in "locking" up low molecular, weight hydrocarbons within the skin care composition. Preferably the wax is a paraffin wax. An example of a particularly preferred alternate immobilizing agent is a paraffin wax such as Parrafm S.P. 434 from Strahl and Pitsch Inc. P.O. Box 1098 West Babylon, NY 11704,<br>
Suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention will have the formula:<br>
 (Formual Removed)<br><br>
*r~<br>
wherein R is a C5-C31 hydrocarbyl group, preferably straight chain C7-C19 alkyl or alkenyl, more preferably straight chain C9-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, most preferably straight chain C11-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, or mixture thereof; Y is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl<br>
moiety having a hydrocarbyl chain with at least 2 free hydroxyls directly connected to the chain; and n is at least 1, Suitable Y groups can be derived from polyols such as glycerol, pentaerythritol; sugars such as raffmose, maltodextrose, galactose, sucrose, glucose, xylose, fructose, maltose, lactose, mannose and erythrose; sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol, malitol, mannitol and sorbitol; and anhydrides of sugar alcohols such as sorbitan,<br>
One class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain sorbitan esters, preferably the sorbitan esters of C16-C22 saturated fatty acids. Because of the manner in which they are typically manufactured, these sorbitan esisrs usually comprise mixtures of mono-, di-, tri-, etc. esters. Representative examples of suitable sorbitan esters include sorbitan palmitates (e.g., SPAN 40), sorbitan stearates (e.g., SPAN 60), and sorbitan behenates, that comprise one or more of the mono-, di- and tri-ester versions of these sorbitan esters, e.g., sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-palmitate, sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-stearate, sorbitan mono-, di and tri-behenate, as well as mixed tallow fatty acid sorbitan mono-, di- and tri-esters. Mixtures of different sorbitan esters can also be used, such as sorbitan palmitates with sorbitan stearates. Particularly preferred sorbitan esters are the sorbitan stearates, typically as a mixture of mono-, di-and tri-esters (plus some tetraester) such as SPAN 60, and sorbitan stearates sold under the trade name GLYCOMUL-S by Lonza, Inc. Although these sorbitan esters typically contain mixtures of mono-, di- and tri-esters, plus some tetraester, the mono- and di-esters are usually the predominant species in these mixtures.<br>
Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprises certain glyceryl monoesters, preferably glyceryl monoesters of C\$-€22 saturated fatty acids such as glyceryl monostearate, glyceryl monopalmitate, and glyceryl monobehenate. Again, like the sorbitan esters, glyceryl monoester mixtures will typically contain some di- and triester. However, such mixtures should contain predominantly the glyceryl monoester species to be useful in the present invention.<br>
Another class of suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid esters for use in the present invention comprise certain sucrose fatty acid esters, preferably the C 32-^22 saturated fatty acid esters of sucrose. Sucrose monoesters and diesters are particularly preferred and include sucrose mono- and di-stearate and sucrose mono- and di- laurate.<br>
Suitable polyhydroxy fatty acid amides for use in the present invention will have<br>
the formula:	<br>
(Formual Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is H, C1-C4 hydrocarbyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, methoxyethyl, methoxypropyl or a mixture thereof, preferably C1-C4 alkyl, methoxyethyl or raethoxypropyl, more preferably C1 or C2 alkyl or methoxypropyl, most preferably C1-C4 alkyl (i.e., methyl) or methoxypropyl; and R.2 is a C5-C31 hydrocarbyl group, preferably straight chain C7-C19 alkyl or alkenyl, more preferably straight chain C9-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, most preferably straight chain C11-C17 alkyl or alkenyl, or mixture thereof; and Z is a polyhydroxyhydrocarbyl moiety having a linear hydrocarbyl chain with at least 3 hydroxyls directly connected to the chain. See U.S. patent 5,174, 927 (Honsa), issued December 29,1992 (herein incorporated by reference) which discloses these polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, as well as their preparation,<br>
The Z moiety preferably will be derived from a reducing sugar in a reductive amination reaction; most preferably glycityl. Suitable reducing sugars include glucose, fructose, maltose, lactose, galactose, mannose, and xylose. High dextrose com syrup, high fructose com syrup, and high maltose corn syrup can be utilized, as well as the individual sugars listed above. These corn syrups can yield mixtures of sugar components for the Z moiety.<br>
The Z moiety preferably will be selected from the group consisting of -CH2-<br>
(CHOH)n.CH20H,	-CH(CH2OHM(CHOH)n_i].CH2OH,	-CH2OH-CH2-<br>
(CHOH)2(CHOR3)(CHOH)-CH20H,<br>
 where n is an integer from 3 to 5, and R3 is H or a cyclic or aliphatic monosaccharide. Most preferred are the glycityls where n is 4, particularly -CH2-(CHOH)4-CH2OH,<br>
In the above formula, Rl can be&gt; for example, N-methyl, N-ethyl, N-propyl, N-isopropyl, N-butyl, N-2-hydroxyethyl, N-methoxypropyl or N-2-hydroxypropyl, R2 can be selected to provide, for example, cocamides, stearamides, oleamides, lauramides, myristamides, capricamides, palmitamides, tallowamides, etc. The Z moiety can be 1-deoxyglucityl, 2-deoxyfructityI, 1-deoxymaltityl, 1-deoxylactityl, l-deoxygalactityl, 1-deoxymannityl, 1-deoxymaltotriotityl, etc.<br>
The most preferred polyhydroxy fatty acid amides have the general formula:<br><br><br>
(Formual Removed)<br>
wherein R1 is methyl or methoxypropyl; R2 is a C11-C17 straight-chain alkyl or alkenyl group.      These   include   N-lauryl-N-methyl   glucamide,   N-lauryl-N-methoxypropyl<br>
glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide, N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-paimityl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide, N-tallowyl-N-methyl glucamide, or N-taUowyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide.<br>
As previously noted, some of the immobilizing agents may require an emulsifier for solubilization in the emollient. This is particularly the case for certain of the glucamides such as the N-alkyl-N-methoxypropyl ghicamides having HLB values of at least about 7, Suitable emulsifiers will typically include those having HLB values below about 7. In this regard, the sorbitan esters previously described, such as the sorbitan stearates, having HLB values of about 4.9 or less have been found useful in solubilizing these glucamide immobilizing agents in petrolatum. Other suitable emulsifiers include steareth-2 (polyethylene glycol ethers of stearyl alcohol that conform to the formula CH3(CH2)n(OCH2CH2)nOH, where n has an average value of 2), sorbitan tristearate, isosorbide laurate, and glyceryl monostearate. The emulsifier can be included in an amount sufficient to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the emollient such that a substantially homogeneous mixture is obtained. For example, an approximately 1:1 mixture of N-cocoyl-N-methyl glucamide and petrolatum that will normally not melt into a single phase mixture, will melt into a single phase mixture upon the addition of 20% of a 1:1 mixture of Steareth-2 and sorbitan tristearate as the emulsifier.<br>
Other types of ingredients that can be used as immobilizing agents, either alone, or in combination with the above-mentioned immobilizing agents, include waxes such as carnauba, beeswax, candelila, paraffin, ceresin, esparto, ouricuri, rezowax, and other known waxes. Preferably the wax is a paraffin wax. An example of a particularly preferred paraffin wax is Parrafin S.P. 434 from Strahl and Pitsch Inc. P.O. Box 1098 West Babylon, NY 11704.<br>
The amount of the optional immobilizing agent that can be included in the composition will depend on a variety of factors, including the actives (e.g., emollients) involved, the particular immobilizing agent involved, the other components in the composition, whether an emulsifier is required to solubilize the immobilizing agent in the other components, and like factors. When present, the composition will typically comprise from about 5 to about 90% of the immobilizing agent. Preferably, the composition will comprise from about 5 to about 50%, most preferably from about 10 to about 40%, of the immobilizing agent.<br>
Of course, it is highly desjnble that at least a portion of the article's topsheet be made of a hydrophilic material to promote rapid transfer of liquids (e.g., urine) through the topsheet. Similarly, it may be desirable that the composition be sufficiently wettable to ensure that liquids will transfer through the topsheet rapidly. Alternatively,<br>
hydrophobic "skin care composition may be utilized, so long as they are applied such that the fluid handling properties of the topsheet are adequately maintained. (For example, as discussed below, nonuniform application of the composition to the topsheet is one means to accomplish this goal.) This diminishes the likelihood that body exudates will flow off the composition-treated topsheet rather than being drawn through the topsheet and being absorbed by the absorbent core.<br>
Where a hydrophilic composition is desired, depending upon the particular components used in the composition, a hydrophilic surfactant (or a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants) may, or may not, be required to improve wettability. For example, some immobilizing agents, such as N-cocoyl-N-methoxypropyl glucamide have HLB values of at least about 7 and are sufficiently wettable without the addition of hydrophilic surfactant, Other immobilizing agents such as the C12-C18 fatty alcohols having HLB values below about 7 may require addition of hydrophilic surfactant to improve wettability when the composition is applied to article topsheets. Similarly, a hydrophobic emollient such as petrolatum may require the addition of a hydrophilic surfactant if hydrophilic composition is desired. Of course, the concern around wertability is not a factor when the wearer-contacting surface under consideration is other than the article's topsheet or when fluid handling properties of the topsheet are adequately maintained via other means (e.g., nonuniform application),<br>
Suitable hydrophilic surfactants will preferably be miscible with the other components of the skin care composition so as to form blended mixtures. Because of possible skin sensitivity of those using disposable absorbent products to which the composition is applied, these surfactants should also be relatively mild and non-irritating to the skin, Typically, these hydrophilic surfactants are nonionic to be not only non-irritating to the skin, but also to avoid other undesirable effects on any other structures within the treated article. For example, reductions in tissue laminate tensile strength, adhesive bond sufficiencies, and the like.<br>
Suitable nonionic surfactants may be substantially nonmigratory after the composition is applied to the article and will typically have HLB values in the range of from about 4 to about 20, preferably from about 7 to about 20. To be nonmigratory, these nonionic surfactants will typically have melt temperatures greater than the temperatures commonJy encountered during storage, shipping, merchandising, and use of disposable absorbent products, e.g., at leastout 30°C. In this regard, these nonionic surfactants will preferably have melting points similar to those of the immobilizing agents previously described.<br><br>
Suitable nonionlc surfactants for use in compositions that will be applied to the articles, at least in the liquid discharge region of the diaper, include alkylglycosides; alkyiglycoside ethers as described in U.S. patent 4,011,389 (Langdon, et al), issued Mach 8, 1977, which is incorporated by reference; alkylpolyethoxylated esters such as Pcf/osperse 1 DOOMS (available from Lonza, Inc., Fair Lawn, New Jersey), ethoxylated sorbitan mono-, di- and/or tri-esters of C12-C18 fatty acids having an average degree of ethr/xylation of from about 2 to about 20, preferably from about 2 to about 10, such as TWEEN 60 (sorbitan esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of abot 20) and TWEEN 61 (sorbitan .esters of stearic acid having an average degree of ethoxylation of about 4), and the condensation products of aliphatic alcohols with from about 1 to about 54 moles of ethylene oxide. The alkyl chain of the aliphatic alcohol is typically in a straight chain (linear) configuration and contains from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred are the condensation products of alcohols having an alkyl group containing from about 11 to about 22 carbon atoms with from about 2 to about 30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Examples of such ethoxylated alcohols include the condensation products of myristyl alcohol with 7 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, the condensation products of coconut alcohol (a mixture of fatty alcohols having alkyl chains varying in length from 10 to 14 carbon atoms) with about 6 moles of ethylene oxide. A number of suitable ethoxylated alcohols are commercially available, including TERGITOL 15-S-9 (the condensation product of C\\-C15 linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by Union Carbide Corporation; KYRO EOB (condensation product ofC13-C15 linear alcohols with 9 moles of ethylene oxide), marketed by The Procter &amp; Gamble Co,, the NEODOL brand name surfactants marketed by Shell Chemical Co., in particular NEODOL 25-12 (condensation product of C12-C15 linear alcohols with 12 moles of ethylene oxide) and NEODOL 23-6.5T (condensation product of C12-C13 linear alcohols with 6.5 moles of ethylene oxide that has been distilled (topped) to remove certain impurities), and especially the PLURAFAC brand name surfactants marketed by BASF Corp., in particular PLURAFAC A-38 (a condensation product of a C18 straight chain alcohol with 27 moles of ethylene oxide). (Certain of the hydrophilic surfactants, in particular ethoxylated alcohols such as NEODOL 25-12, can also function as alkyl ethoxylate emollients). Other examples of preferred ethoxylated alcohol surfactants include Id's class of Brij surfactants and mixtyfEs thereof, with Brij 72 (i.e., Steareth-2) and Brij 76 (i.e., Steareth-10) being especially preferred, Also, mixtures of cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol ethoxylated to an average degree of ethoxylation of from about 10 to about 20 may also be used as the hydrophilic surfactant.<br><br>
Another type of suitable surfactant for use in the composition includes Aerosol OT, a dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid marketed by American Cyanamid Company,<br>
Still another type of suitable surfactant for use in the composition includes silicone copolymers such as General Electric SF 1188 (a copolymer of a polydimethylsiloxane and a polyoxyalkylene ether) and General Electric SF 1228 (a silicone polyether copolymer). These silicone surfactants can be used in combination with the other types of hydrophilic surfactants discussed above, such as the ethoxylated alcohols, These silicone surfactants have been found to be effective at concentrations as low as 0.1%, more preferably from about 0.25 to about 1.0%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The amount of hydrophilic surfactant required to increase the wertability of the composition to a desired level will depend in-part upon the HLB value and level of immobilizing agent, if any, used, the HLB value of the surfactant used and like factors. The composition can comprise from about 0.1 to about 50% of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase the wettability properties of the composition. Preferably, the composition comprises from about 1 to about 25%, most preferably from about 10 to about 20%, of the hydrophilic surfactant when needed to increase wettability.<br>
Compositions can comprise other components typically present in emulsions, creams, ointment, lotions, powders, suspensions, etc. of this type. These components include water, viscosity modifiers, perfumes, disinfectant antibacterial actives, antiviral agents, vitamins, pharmaceutical actives, film formers, deodorants, opacifiers, astringents, solvents, preservatives, and the like. In addition, stabilizers can be added to enhance the shelf life of the composition such as cellulose derivatives, proteins and lecithin. All of these materials are well known in the art as additives for such formulations and can be employed in appropriate amounts in the compositions for use herein.<br>
If water-based skin care compositions are used, a preservative will be needed. Suitable preservatives include propyl paraben, methyl paraben, benzyl alcohol, benzylkonnium, tribasic calcium phosphate, BHT, or acids such as citric, tartaric, maleic, lactic, malic, benzoic, salicylic, and the like. Suitable viscosity increasing agents include some of the agents described as effective immobilizing agents. Other suitable viscosity increasing agents include alkyl galactomannan, silica, talc, magnesium silicate, sorbitol, colloidal silicone dioxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, zinc stearate, wool wax alcohol, sorbiton, sesquioleate, cetyl hydroxy ethyl cellulose and other modified celluloses. Suitable solvents include propylene glycol, glycerine, cyclomethicone, polyethylene<br><br>
glycols, hexalene glycol, diol and multi-hydroxy based solvents. Suitable vitamins include A, D3, E, B5 and E acetate.<br>
In preparing products according to the present invention, the lotion composition is applied to the outer surface (i.e., body facing surface) of the topsheet 24 within the second region 32. Any of a variety of application methods that distribute lubricious materials having a molten or liquid consistency can be used. Suitable methods include spraying, printing (e.g., flexographic printing), coating (e.g., gravure coating), extrusion, or combinations of these application techniques, e.g. spraying the composition on a rotating surface, such as a calender roll, that then transfers the composition to the outer surface of the article topsheet.<br>
An effective amount of composition needs to be applied to the second region 32 of the topsheet 24 for reducing the adherence of BM to the skin and/or providing a skin benefit to the wearer. The composition is preferably applied to the second region 32 of the topsheet in an amount ranging from about 0.1 mg/in2 to about 35 ing/in2- Such levels of composition are believed to be adequate to impart the desired therapeutic and/or protective benefits to the topsheet.<br>
The composition can be applied to the second region 32 of the topsheet 24 at any point during assembly. For example, the composition can be applied to the topsheet of the finished disposable absorbent product before it has been packaged. The composition can also be applied to the topsheet before it is combined with the other raw materials to form a finished disposable absorbent product.<br>
The composition is typically applied from a melt thereof to the article topsheet. Since the composition melts at significantly above ambient temperatures, it is usually applied as a heated coating to the topsheet. Typically, the composition is heated to a temperature in the range from about 35_ to about 100°C, preferably from 40° to about 90°C, prior to being applied to the article topsheet. Once the melted composition has been applied to the article topsheet, it is allowed to cool and solidify to form solidified coating or film on the surface of the topsheet. Preferably, the application process is designed to aid in the cooling/set up of the composition.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1 and 3, the fecal management member 30 is preferably secured to the topsheet 24 in a very minimal extent to preserve the openness of the fecal management member 30 to allev ready penetration of low-viscosity fecal material, More preferably, the fecal management member 30 is not secured to the topsheet 24 at all preserving the openness of the fecal management member 30 and also allowing the topsheet 24 to separate from the fecal management member 30 creating additional void<br><br>
space. However, it is recognized that the fecal management member 30 should be secured within the diaper 20 to prevent it from freely moving about. To this end, it is preferred that the fecal management member 30 be secured directly to the underlying absorbent core 28. A particularly preferred attachment means is an adhesive having a hydrophilicity which is greater than the hydrophilicity of the fecal management member 30. More preferably, the attachment means is an adhesive having a hydrophilicity which is greater than the sheet of fibers 126, and more preferably a hydrophilicity which is also greater than the hydrophilicity of the backing 120.<br>
The absorbent core 28 is preferably secured directly to the topsheet 24. A particularly preferred attachment means is an adhesive having a hydrophilicity which is greater than the hydrophilicity of the topsheet 24. More preferably, the attachment means is an adhesive having a hydrophilicity which is greater than the sheet of fibers 126, more preferably a hydrophilicity which is also greater than the hydrophilicity of the backing 120.<br>
When constructing the diaper 20, the topsheet is preferably positioned on a conveyer or other suitable processing equipment such that its inner surface is facing upward. The fecal management member 30 is then positioned on the topsheet 24 in the region corresponding to the second region 32 such that the backing 120 of the fecal management member 30 is facing upward. An adhesive is then applied to the inner surface of the topsheet 24 and the backing 120. The adhesive selected at least has a hydrophilicity greater than that of the topsheet 24, and preferably, the adhesive selected has a hydrophilicity greater than that of both the topsheet 24 and the fecal management member 30. The fecal management member 30 blocks the adhesive preventing it from contacting the portions of the topsheet lying underneath the fecal management member 30.<br>
Suitable means for applying the adhesive include a uniform continuous layer of adhesive, a patterned layer of adhesive, or an array of separate lines, spirals, or spots of adhesive. One preferred attachment means comprises an open pattern network of filaments of adhesive as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,573,986 entitled "Disposable Waste-Containment Garment", which issued to Minetola et al. on March 4,1986. Other suitable attachment means include several lines of adhesive filaments which are swirled into a spiral pattern, as is illustrated be the apparatus and methods shown in U.S. Patent 3,911,173 issued to Sprague, Jr. on October 7, 1975; U.S. Patent 4,785,996 issued to Ziecker, et al. on November 22, 1978; and U.S. Patent 4,842,666 issued to Werenicz on June 27, 1989. Each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The amount of adhesive and application technique can be selected to control the degree of penetration of the adhesive into the topsheet 24 which is not blocked by the fecal management member 30. If the topsheet 24 is relatively hydrophobic, it may be desirable to have a greater degree of penetration of adhesive into the topsheet 24 within the firs: region 31. Alternatively, if the topsheet 24 is relatively hydrophillic less penetration of the adhesive may be needed to obtain the desired urine handling characteristics in the first region 31.<br>
The diaper 20 may further comprise elasticized leg cuffs (not shown) which provide improved containment of liquids and other body exudates. Each elasticized leg cuff may comprise several different embodiments for reducing the leakage of body exudates in the leg regions. (The leg cuff can be and is sometimes also referred to as leg bands, side flaps, barrier cuffs, or elastic cuffs.) U.S. Patent 3,860,003 describes a disposable diaper 20 which provides a contractible leg opening having a side flap and one or more elastic members to provide an elasticized leg cuff (gasketing cuff). Commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,909,803 entitled "Disposable Absorbent Article Having Elasticized Flaps" issued to Aziz et al. on March 20, 1990, describes a disposable diaper 20 having "stand-up" elasticized flaps (barrier cuffs) to improve the containment of the leg regions. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,695,278 entitled "Absorbent Article Having Dual Cuffs" issued to Lawson on September 22, 1987, describes a disposable diaper 20 having dual cuffs including a gasketing cuff and a barrier cuff.<br>
The diaper 20 preferably further comprises an elastic waist feature (not shown) that provides improved fit and containment. The elastic waist feature is that portion or zone of the diaper 20 which is intended to elastically expand and contract to dynamically fit the wearer's waist. The elastic waist feature at least extends longitudinally outwardly from at least one of the waist edges of the absorbent core 28 and generally forms at least a portion of the end edge of the diaper 20. Disposable diapers are generally constructed so as to have two elastic waist features, one positioned in the first region 31 and one positioned in the second region 32, although diapers can be constructed with a single elastic waist feature. Further, while the elastic waist feature or any of its constituent elements can comprise a separate element affixed to the diaper 20, the elastic waist feature is preferably constructed as an extension of other elements of the diaper 20 such as the backsheet 26 or the topsheet 24, preferably both the backsheet 26 and the topsheet 24. The elasticized waistband 34 may be constructed ie*a number of different configurations including those described in U.S. Patent 4,515,595 issued to Kievit et al. on May 7, 1985 and the above referenced U.S. Patent Application Serial No 07/715,152; each of these references being incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The diaper 20 also comprises a fastening system 36 which forms a side closure which maintains the first region 31 and the second region 32 in an overlapping configuration such that lateral tensions are maintained around the circumference of the diaper 20 to maintain the diaper 20 on the wearer. Exemplary fastening systems are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,846,815 entitled "Disposable Diaper Having An Improved Fastening Device" issued to Scripps on July 11, 1989; U.S. Patent 4,894,060 entitled "Disposable Diaper With Improved Hook Fastener Portion" issued to Nestegard on January 16, 1990; commonly assigned U.S. Patent 4,946,527 entitled "Pressure-Sensitive Adhesive Fastener And Method of Making Same" issued to Battrell on August 7, 1990; commonly assigned U.S. Patent 3,848,594 entitled "Tape Fastening System for Disposable Diaper" issued to Buell on November 19, 1974; commonly assigned U.S. Patent Bl 4,662,875 entitled "Absorbent Article" issued to Hirotsu et al. on May 5, 1987; and the hereinbefore referenced U.S. Patent Application 07/715,152; each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The diaper 20 is preferably applied to a wearer by positioning one of the regions, preferably the second region 32, under the wearer's back and drawing the remainder of the diaper 20 between the wearer's legs so that the other region, preferably the first region 31, is positioned across the front of the wearer. The tape tabs 36 of the fastening system are then released from the release portion. The diaperer then wraps the elasticized side panel around the wearer, while still grasping the tab portion. The fastening system is secured to the outer surface of the diaper 20 to effect two side closure.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obvious to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is therefore intended to cover in the appended claims all such changes and modifications that are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
