2006/027595 	PCT/GB 2005/003475<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPOSITION   COMPRISING   AN   ISOMER   OF   A   BETAMIMETIC AGENT  AND  AM  ANTI-CHOLINERGIC  AGENT<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a betamimetric agent optionally in combination with other active agents, the c cm positions being useful in the treatment of bronchoconstriction, asthma and related disorders thereof; to methods of preparing the compositions, and to their u se in therapy.<br>
Asthma is chronic inflammatory disease affecting about 20 million to 35 milion persons worldwide, in which the patient suffers episodes of reversible ai ways obstruction due to bronchial hyperresponsivenes. Due to inflammation of tie bronchial tissues, there is restriction of the bronchial airway leading to bronchoconstriction. Pharmacological intervention is aimed at the prevention and ccntrol of asthma symptoms, reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and reversing airflow obstruction. The most commonly administered therapeutic class of drugs is betamimetics, which may be administered either alone or in combination with other related therapeutic agents. Betamimetics are preferably administered by inhalation so as to provide local action and thereby reduce undesired systemic effects. Two main beneficial effects of inhaled betamimetics in asthma are bronchodilation and inhibition of bronchoconstriction induced by exercise and other provocative stimuli. Inhaled short-acting betamimetics like salbutamol (also known as albuterol) and terbutaline are recommended for the relief of acute symptoms, while long-acting agents like salmeterol are used in combination with corticosteroids, anticholinergics and leukotriene inhibitors for long-term asthma control and prevent tolerance to the inhaled medication.<br>
One such combination of salbutamol with ipratropium which is available under the trade name Duoneb is marketed by Day Pharmaceuticals. This contains ipratropium bromide in a concentration of 0.5 mg and albuterol sulphate in a concentration of 3 mg equivalent to albuterol 2.5 mg per 2.5 ml inhalation solution. This is described in US patent number 6632842 in which the inhalation<br>
-2-<br><br>
3<br>
WO 2006/027595	PCT/GB2003475 <br>
solution comprising albuterol and ipratropium is prefilled in one single dispensing container suitable for nebulisation.<br>
Patent application number WO2003013633 to Glaxo Group Limited describes a dry powder pharmaceutical composition comprising a betamimetic and anti-cholinergic agent.<br>
US 2002189610 claims a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a betamimetic agent along with ipratropium wherein the betamimetic agent is formoterol or salmeterol or their salts thereof in a buffered solution suitable for inhalation.<br>
It has been proved that racemic salbutamol, a commonly used bronchodilator, is an exact 50:50 mixture of two enantiomers, the R- and S-isomers. In-vitro studies suggest that the two enantiomers have different binding affinities for the beta-adrenoreceptor, may exert opposing effects on inflammation, demonstrate different effects on mucociliary transport, and display differing pharmacokinetics. The R-isomer has greater bronchodilatory effects than the racemate and may have anti-inflammatory properties. The S-isomer has markedly less affinity for the beta-adrenoreceptor.<br>
Several methods for preparation of levoalbuterol have been described in the prior art such as US patent application number 20040115136 by King Code which describes a method of preparation of levalbuterol tartarate.<br>
Patent application number CN1413976 by Suzhou Junning New Drug Dev CT (CN) describes the synthesis of levosalbutamol and US patent application number US2004054215 to CIPLA Limited discloses a method for obtaining an optically pure R-isomer of albuterol.<br>
Salmeterol is a potent, long lasting betamimetic agent commonly prescribed for the treatment of patients with obstructive airway disease such as asthma. Salmeterol is commonly marketed as a racemate mixture under the trademark SEREVENT.<br>
The R and S isomers of salmeterol are known. European patent application number EP0422889 and US patent number 5,919,827 both relate to the R-isomer of salmeterol and suggest that it has a particularly advantageous<br>
2:<br><br>
WO2006/0127595<br><br>
PCT/GB2005/003475<br><br>
profile of action. More particularly, US patent number 5,919,827 suggests that the use of the R-isomer for the treatment of, inter alia, asthma provides a safe and effective therapy while reducing undesirable side effects typically associated with betamimetic agents.<br>
US patent application number 20040136918 claims a combination of R-salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate as a metered dose aerosol inhalation for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and respiratory tract disorders.<br>
Formoterol has two chiral centers and therefore has possibility of 4 different isomeric combinations of material available. However, it has been found that R,R formoterol is 1000-times more potentially active than its S,S-isomer or any other available isomer. It is well described by, for example, US 6068833, US 5795564 and US 6299863.<br>
Combinations of R,R-formoterol along with corticosteroids in bronchodilating therapy have been described in W02004047828 which claims a combination of R,R-formoterol and roflumilast; and in US2004019025 which claims a combination of R,R-formoterol and rofleponide.<br>
The present invention hereby provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective isomer of a betamimetic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, polymorph or derivative thereof, optionally along with a suitable bronchodilator such as an anti-cholinergic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, isomer, polymorph or derivatives thereof, thereby providing a additive effect.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide for a formulation; which provides the advantages of potent and selective therapeutic activity by employing the therapeutically more effective isomer of betamimetic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, polymorph or derivative thereof.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide for a formulation, which comprises a combination of the therapeutically more effective isomer of betamimetic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, polymorph or derivative thereof, optionally along with an anti-cholinergic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, isomer,<br>
-3~<br><br>
WO 2006/027595 PCT/GB2005/003475<br><br>
polymorph or derivative thereof, thereby providing additive effect for patients with chronic disorders of the respiratory tract such as. asthma and COPD.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide for a formulation, which employs the therapeutically effective isomer of a betamimetic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, polymorph or derivative thereof, thereby providing a more potent formulation and therefore avoiding side effects associated with higher dosages.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide for a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of respiratory disorders such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), and disorders resulting in bronchoconstriction.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide for a method of preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition in a dosage form suitable for inhalation, which composition comprises a therapeutically effective isomer of a betamimetic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative or polymorph thereof substantially free of the less therapeutically effective isomer(s) of said agent, and optionally an anticholinergic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative, isomer or polymorph thereof.<br>
There are also provided methods for preparing pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention.<br>
There is also provided novel pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of respiratory and related disorders such as asthma, COPD, and such other disorders, which result in bronchoconstriction.<br>
The invention employs the most active, therapeutically speaking, isomer of a betamimetic agent. Substantially free of the less therapeutically effective isomer(s) means that these isomers will not be present in any significant amount. Suitably, such isomers will be present at no more than 10% w/w of betamimetic, more preferably 1% w/w or less.   Thus, for example, compositions containing<br><br>
WO 2000/027595	PCT/GB2005/003475<br>
levosalbutamol, (R) -salmeterol or R, R-formoterol are substantially free of the S-isomers of these compounds.<br>
Betamimetic agents are known to provide a bronchodilator effect to patients by acting on the p-2 adrenergic receptors in the airway smooth muscles and the bronchial smooth muscles, resulting in relief from the symptoms of breathlessness. More particularly, betamimetic agents have been shown to increase the conductance of potassium channels in airway muscle cells, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and relaxation. Therefore being very selective in their activity, they are a preferred class of bronchodilators. This class comprises compounds such as salbutamol, salmeterol, formoterol, rimeterol and acebutolol.<br>
The present invention is advantageous in that it employs the therapeutically effective isomers of these compounds. Compounds such as salbutamol, salmeterol and formoterol are known to exist as their R- and. ,S-. isomers and for each of these compounds the R-isomers are more active than the S-isomers. The difference in activity is such that the S-isomer has markedly less affinity for the beta-adrenoreceptors than the R-isomer. The R-isomer has greater bronchodilatory effects and-has anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the R-isomers are much more therapeutically active, and are hence preferred. Although use of only these compounds helps to bring about sufficient dilation of the bronchial vessels so as to provide relief, in order to avoid development of tolerance to such drugs, it is preferable to give them in combination with other bronchodilators. Such combinations enhance the bronchodilatory activity due to an additive effect. Anticholinergic agents are a preferred class of compounds, and can act additively to provide enhanced activity and avoid any side effects. Anti-cholinergics include compounds such as ipratropium, atropine, tiotropium or salts, solvates, esters, isomers, polymorphs or derivatives thereof. The particular combination of a betamimetic agent and an anticholinergic proves to be highly effective because both the drugs provide bronchodilation by different mechanism of action, which therefore results in an additive effect. These anti-cholinergics act on the muscarinic receptors that are present in the large central airways thus relaxing the central airways. And compounds like levosalbutamol, (R) -salmeterol<br><br>
7<br>
WO 2(106/027595	PCT/GB2005/003475<br>
and R, R-formoterol act on the peripheral airways and relax those muscles. Therefore, the combination provides enhanced activity due to additive effect. The onset of action is much faster due to the use of therapeutically effective isomers such as levosalbutamol,"(R) -salmeterol or R, R-formoterol and the duration of activity is longer due to the anticholinergic compounds such as ipratropium and tiotropium. The duration of action gets still prolonged if a longer acting betamimetic such as (R) -salmeterol and R, R-formoterol is used.<br>
Commercially available formulation of racemic salbutamol sulphate and ipratropium bromide by Day Pharmaceuticals as described in patent number US 6632842, claims a combination comprising 2.5 mg of salbutamol sulphate and 500 meg of ipratropium bromide. However, with the use of the therapeutically effective isomer i.e. levosalbutamol, the dosage of the betamimetic agent to be administered is reduced to half or even less than half. Due to this reduced dosage, there are fewer cardiovascular complications, which are associated with higher doses of bronchodilators. Therefore, the use of such a combination comprising a therapeutically effective isomer and an anti-cholinergic agent results in increased patient compliance.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention levosalbutamol may be formulated as a solid oral dosage forms e.g. tablet, capsule, extended release granules/tablet etc. These are formulated by techniques known to any person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Levosalbutamol can be blended with diluents, binders, disintegrants, glidants, lubricant and the resulting mixture compressed.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention levosalbutamol may be formulated as a liquid. The liquid formulation may comprise one or more suitable ingredients for liquid formulations like thickeners, sweeteners, buffering agents, preservatives, artificial colors, chelating agents/sequestering agents and flavours and other ingredients in addition to levosalbutamol.<br>
A liquid formulation according to the present invention preferably has a pH in the range of 3.0 to 5.0.<br><br>
8<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition comprising levosalbutamol in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
The manufacturing process comprises, dissolving preservative, sequestering agent and buffers in specified amount of purified water followed by addition of the drug. This is followed by the addition of other ingredients to the above solution. The pH is checked and finally the volume is made up.<br>
The levosalbutamol according to the present invention can be administered in a dose of 30mcg to 8mg.<br>
In the compositions of the invention, preferred ranges for the amount of betamimetric agent and the amount of anticholinergic agent (separately) include 0.005 - 0.5% w/w and 0.05 to 0.2% w/w. Preferred compositions include from 0.005 to 0.5% w/w levosalbutamol and from 0.005 to 0.5% w/w ipratropium,.more, preferably from 0.05 to 0.2% w/w levosalbutamol and from 0.05 to 0.2%o w/w ipratropium. .<br>
Levosalbutamol may, for example, be administered in the doses of 0.63 meg to 1.5 mg up to 3-4 times daily. Ipratropium bromide can, for example, be administered in a concentration of 100 meg to 500 meg, 3-4 times daily. (R) -salmeterdl can, for example, be administered up to 8 mg one to four times daily whereas R, R-formoterol can, for example, be administered in doses between 8 meg to 25 meg daily. The combination is administered by the inhalation route so as to provide local action and thus avoid undesirable systemic effects.<br>
Specific combinations of any one of R-salbutamol, R-salmeterol, and R, R-formoterol with any one of ipratropium, atropine or tiotropium may be used in any of the inhalation formulations of the invention - for example MDI, DPI or inhalation solution/suspension form.<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition in a dosage form suitable for inhalation, said composition comprising the compound of the present invention or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative, or polymorph thereof substantially free of the less therapeutically effective isomer(s) of said agent, and optionally an anticholinergic agent or a salt, solvate, ester, derivative, isomer or polymorph thereof, is found to have surprising properties. Therefore, the pharmaceutical composition is synergistic.<br>
The combination may further be combined with pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients in order to provide a suitable formulation. The combination may, for example, be formulated as an inhalation solution for nebulisation, as an aerosol composition, as dry powder composition for inhalation.<br><br>

The R-isomer of salbutamol sulphate has shown improvement in the Fine Particle Dose (FPD) compared to racemic salbutamol sulphate. The results are as follows :<br><br>
	R-salbutamol sulphate inhaler	Racemate salbutamol sulphate inhaler<br>
Fine Particle Dose (%)	Trial 1	Trial II	Trial III	40.80<br>
	51.38	51.90	53.22	<br>
Before testing, both the R-isomer and the racemate are micronised in an identical way.<br>
Cascade analysis gives a value for FPD (Fine particle dose - particles below 4.7 microns) / % FPF (fine particle fraction) which gives a measure of the quantity of particles which have probability to reach the lungs.<br>
The test is done according to USP using Cascade impactor.<br>
A study was conducted to compare bronchodilator responses to levosalbutamol sulphate and racemic salbutamol sulphate administered via metered dose inhaler in a randomized double-blind, single-dose, crossover study. In this study single doses of 100 meg levosalbutamol sulphate and 200 meg  racemic<br><br>

WO 2006/027595	PCT/GB2005/003475<br>
salbutamol sulphate were administered via MDI in subjects with stable mild to moderate bronchial asthma, who were then monitored over a period of 6 hours. It-was found that 100 meg levosalbutamol sulphate and 200 meg racemic salbutamol sulphate produced equivalent time-dependant  bronchodilator responses  over 6<br>
hours.<br>
Thus, it is clear from the study that a reduced dose of levosalbutamol sulphate is required compared to racemic salbutamol sulphate to have the same therapeutic effect.<br>
We have found that levosalbutamol is more free flowing than the racemate and has the advantage of giving better suspension and dispersion characteristics.<br>
