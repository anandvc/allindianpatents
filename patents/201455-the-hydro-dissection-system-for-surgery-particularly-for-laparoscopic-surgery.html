				<td>Background of the invention:<br>
Hydro-dissection is a procedure by which tissue planes are easily separated by injecting normal saline / ringer solution / sterile water etc. under pressure (hydro-jet) within the tissues. This is usually done with the help of syringe and needle. It is a time-honoured procedure in open surgery and has been successfully applied in general surgical procedures to facilitate tissue dissection, particularly in difficult situations. It is mostly popular among the Eye-surgeons for cataract operations and Pediatric surgeons for separation of hernia sac, particularly when it is associated with un-descended testis. It has also been tried in laparoscopic tissue dissection by surgeons like Naude GP, Morris E, Bongard FS and a few others where they have used the available suction-irrigation machine with either the laparoscopic aspiration needle or the 5 mm suction-irrigation canula.<br>
Hydro-dissection in laparoscopic surgery is not po'pular because of the following reasons:<br>
1.	Want of suitable, simple and economic instruments / device.<br>
2.	Lack   of  comprehensive   and   detailed   technique   of  using   high-pressure<br>
normal saline or water jet on tissues.<br>
3.	Lack of study report on the use of safe range of hydro-thrust on tissues to<br>
avoid inadvertent injuries on vital structures.<br>

A commercially available medical grade normal saline/ isotonic salt solution glass bottle (A) with an airtight rubber cap sealed with a metal strip is hung upside down. There are two depressions in the central portion of this metal sealed rubber cap through which an inlet pipe (B3) and a outlet pipe (H) entering are inserted for their respective functions respectively.<br>
The inlet metal pipe (B3) is L-shaped. The sharp edge (B4) of the vertical portion pierces the rubber cap through one of the holes and reaches the top of the inverted glass bottle above the level of the Normal saline/isotonic salt solution. The terminal end of the horizontal portion (Bl) is attached to a metal pipe connector (E2) with the help of a rubber tube connector (El). An air inflation rubber bulb (C) with a one-way valve (Cl) is connected to the other end of the metal pipe connector (E2). A pressure gauge (F) is attached to the T-extension of metal inlet pipe (B3) with the help of a pipe line (Fl). The vertical<br><br>
portion of the inlet pipe (B3) is extended downwards to act as a water trap' (B5) which collects the normal saline/isotonic salt solution that enters into the vertical portion of the inlet pipe during its insertion in to the normal saline/isotonic salt solution glass bottle before its tip reaches above the level of fluid.<br>
The outlet metal pipe (H) is also L-shaped. The sharp edge of the small vertical portion (H1) pierces the other hole of the metal sealed rubber cap and reaches just above the cap. The horizontal portion (H2) is attached to a synthetic pipe (Ol) of suitable diameter, which is ultimately connected to the hand-instruments of the system, subject of matter of invention, for delivering the hydro-jet to the operation site.<br>
In another preferred  embodiment of the invention,  the  following additional<br>
attachments  are added  to  the device details of which  has  been  shown  in<br>
Fig. 3 where as:<br>
One release valve (screw type) R1 is connected to the rubber bulb (C) and<br>
with the rubber tube-connector (El).<br>
One one-way valve (V1) is attached to the terminal end of the Bl portion of<br>
the metal inlet pipe. The rubber tube-connector (El) here is to be connected to<br>
the other end of the valve (V1). This one-way valve (V1) allows the air to enter<br>
the metal inlet pipe and thus into the sealed normal saline glass bottle (A) but<br>
prevents its escape.<br>
10<br><br>
One air filter (T) is attached to the pipeline (Fl) connecting the B2 extension of<br>
the metal inlet pipe to the pressure gauge (F).<br>
One stopcock (S1) is attached to the B2 extension of the L-shaped metal inlet<br>
pipe or the connector (Fl) before being connected to the pressure gauge (F).<br>
With this stopcock, the pressure gauge may be disconnected functionally from<br>
the air inlet metal pipe when necessary.<br>
One stopcock (S2) is attached to the horizontal portion (H2) of the outlet metal<br>
pipe before it is ultimately connected to the synthetic pipe (Ol) which finally<br>
delivers the high pressure hydro jet to the invented hand instruments.<br>
The Hand-instrument of this system has been shown in Fig. 04 where zero degree blunt &amp; straight tip hydro-dissection canula is used: -<br>
Different components, which have been shown by the reference numerals, are as follows:<br>
1.	Zero degree blunt and straight tip of the canula.<br>
2.	Shaft (non-insulated) of the canula.<br>
3.	Threaded end of the canula to be attached to the rotary / trumpet type<br>
valve (Hub)<br>
4.	Threaded connector with canula.<br>
5.	Three way valve / stopcock (roller type).<br>
6.	Selection lever - the lever in one extreme position opens up one channel<br>
11<br><br>
and in opposite extreme position opens up the other channel while in the 'mid' position closes both the channels.<br>
7   &amp; 8.         Channels to connect with the high-pressure normal saline / isotonic salt solution jet line and sucker machine.<br>
9.	Trumpet valve.<br>
10.	Spring housing at the bottom of the valve (inside).<br>
11.	Lever - when pressed the valve opens up the channel and when the<br>
pressure is released the spring pushes up the valve and closes the<br>
channel.<br>
12.	Connector to high pressure normal saline/isotonic salt solution jet pipe<br>
line.<br>
V2.     Rotary valve (three way).<br>
V3.     Trumpet type valve attachment with the canula.<br>
In this canula, the tip is straight and smooth circumferentially. The opening of the canula tip (1) is made by transecting it vertically so that it looks straight. This has been described as 'zero degree opening'.<br>
The various sizes of canula gauges may be used, however 14 G /   16 G is<br>
preferred.<br>
Tip of the canula (1) is connected to a comparatively wider (5 mm OD) shaft (2)<br>
which is non-insulated. Hence, diathermy current is not safe while using this canula. Other end of the shaft (2) is connected to the hub (3) which has got a<br>
12<br><br>
thread inside. This can be threaded to a conventional three-way rotary valve (V2) or to a conventional trumpet valve (V3) as depicted in fig. 04.<br>
While using a rotary valve (three way) V2, inlet 7 &amp; 8 is connected to the high pressure normal saline jet line and suction line, respectively, and the outlet 4 is threaded to the canula. The lever 6 can manipulate this rotary valve so that either the high-pressure saline jet is passed through the H.D. canula or the suction line is opened to suck the fluid inside the abdomen, through the canula. The lever may also be placed in-between these two options to stop both the functions.<br>
If a trumpet type valve (V3) is used one valve is enough for the H.D. canula. Here the valve is loaded in a metal jacket where there is a spring beneath the valve (10) and the lever (11) on the other side of the valve. Normally, the spring with in the housing (10) pushes the valve up so that the hole through the valve is not in the same alignment as that of the normal saline jet pipeline (12). Once the valve is pushed down by pressing the lever (11) the hole in the valve comes in the same alignment as that of the normal saline jet pipeline and thus the normal saline passes through the canula.<br>
13<br><br>
Description of Hydro-dissection (H.D.) canula with Diathermy current application facility has has been provided with reference to figure 5 where as like reference letter/ numerals are same as figure 04 further other components are as follows:<br>

14a.	Alternative site for Diathermy connector.<br>
15.	Detachable tip with screw type attachment.<br>
V3, V4.         Same as fig. 04.<br>
Here, the shaft of the canula (except the tip) is insulated. The Diathermy connector (14) is fitted to the hub (3) of the canula. Alternatively, it (14a) may be fitted to the rotary valve (V2) which is threaded with the canula. Connection of this insulated shaft (13) may be detachable (threaded) or fixed by welding etc.<br>
Various types of canula tips are necessary according to the different surgical situations, personal preferences of the surgeons and additional mechanical advantages. So, in further modification of this type of canula, different types of detachable tips have been designed. Here, as shown in fig. 06, working tip of<br>
14<br><br>
the H.D. canula (1) can be threaded to the shaft of the canula (13) with the help of the male and female threading (15).<br>

20, 21	Curved and straight H.D. canula.<br>
27	Suction pipe line,<br>
33	Silicon rubber rings.<br>
34	Outer insulated suction canula.<br>
This composite high-pressure saline jet hydro-dissection canula consists of a canula shaft and a canula hub. The outer insulated wider canula (22) contains two narrower H.D. canula (20 &amp; 21) inside it. The outer wider canula (22) is insulated through out and contains a knurled area (23) near its operating tip.<br>
One of the inner narrower H.D, canula is zero degree, blunt tipped, curved (20) and the other is zero degree, blunt tipped, straight (21). With the help of the<br>
18<br><br>
levers on the hub (24a, 24b), the desired canula can be ejected out from within the outer canula (22) to act as the operating tip and can also be retrieved by the reverse movement of the levers. Both the H.D. canula (20, 21) are non-insulated and can be used as a diathermy electrode. The desired H.D. canula (20, 21) with straight or curved operating tip may be ejected out for hydro-dissection along with the use of monopolar diathermy for cutting or coagulation of the vessels and tissues. The wider canula (22) can be used to suck out the collected fluid / fumes from inside the body cavity. The knurled surface near the operating tip of the canula (22) can be used for blunt dissection.<br>
The hub-canula junction as shown in fig 07 contains two silicon rubber rings (33) through which the H.D. canula (20, 21) passes. These rubber rings fits snuggly around the canulae to prevent the leakage of gas without compromising the axial movement facility of the canulae. Beside the two rubber rings (33) there is a wide 'D'-shaped area which depicts the suction pipeline (27).<br>
On the either side of the hub there are two levers (24a, 24b). These levers are connected with the H.D. canulae inside the hub and projects beyond the surface of the hub through a longitudinal slit. By moving the levers back and forth, the H.D. canulae can be moved forwards or backwards. On either end of these slits, there are two small slots (25a, 25b) where the levers can be locked.<br>
19<br><br>
The H.D. canulae (20, 21) are connected to a rotary valve (28) with two silicon rubber pipes (26). These rubber pipes are long enough to allow extreme forward movement of the canulae (20, 21) with the help of the levers (24a, 24b). The rotary valve (28) is connected to the high pressure saline jet pipeline with the help of the connector 31. This rotary valve (28) has got three positions that can be selected with the help of the lever (28a) projecting from the surface of the hub. By rotating the lever and selecting, the saline jet may be passed through either of the H.D. canulae 20 / 21 or may be totally stopped from flowing through either of the canulae.<br>
The sue'ion pipeline (27) is attached to a stopcock (29) so that the suction can be controlled as per the requirement with the help of a lever (29a) projected on the surface of the hub. The other end of the stopcock (29) is connected to the suction machine with the help of the connector 32.<br>
A diathermy connector (30) is attached to the hub so that a monopolar diathermy cable can be connected to this hand-instrument. The whole of the outer surface of the hub except the diathermy connector (30), levers (24a, 24b) and margins of the slots (25a, 25b) is insulated by a non-conductor coating.<br>

Fig. 08 describes the modified composite high pressure saline jet Hydro-dissection (H.D.) canula with Diathermy current application facility and roller type stopcock control on saline jet. The different components have been shown whereas:<br>
35	Slots on the inner walls of the slits.<br>
36	Horizontal separators on either side of the interior of the<br>
hub.<br>
37a, 37b	Rollers.<br>
38	T-type metal connector.<br>
Others	-        same as fig. 07.<br>
Description of canula part, carmla-hub junction, levers (24a, 24b) with the H.D. canulae, slits on the hub surface, the slots (25a, 25b) to lock the levers and suction pipeline (27) with Intervening stopcock (29) control are same as that described in fig. 07 (composite high pressure saline jet Hydro-dissection (H.D.) canula with Diathermy current application facility and rotary / trumpet valve control)<br>
In this, the hub contains a T-type metal connector (38). The longitudinal limb of this metal connector (38) is connected to the high-pressure hydro jet pipeline with the help of the connector (31).<br>
21<br><br>
The transverse limb of the metal connector (38) pierces the horizontal separator (36) on either side. On the outer side of the horizontal separators (36), there are two connectors, which are connected to the H.D. canulae (20, 21) with the help of silicon rubber pipelines. Length of these silicon rubber pipe lines are kept redundant so as to allow extreme forward movement of the H.D. canulae (20, 21).<br>
Rollers (37a, 37b) are partially projected outside the surface of the hub through the longitudinal slits. These rollers have axles in the center. The inner wall of the slits contains slots (35) where the axles of the rollers are fitted. Thus, the rollers move forwards and backwards along the longitudinal slits on the hub.<br>
As depicted in fig. 08 this part of the hub, which contains the slots to accommodate the rollers, are oblique. Hence, the rollers at their extreme forward position compresses the silicon rubber pipe against the horizontal separators (36) of the hub to obliterate the lumen completely so that the saline jet cannot reach the H.D. canulae (20, 21). The rollers in the extreme backward position create no compression over the silicon rubber pipelines and hence, allow the saline jet to pass through them.<br>

51	Connector for the high-pressure hydro jet pipe line.<br>
52	Canula.<br>
53	'Apposition lock' with the shaft of the canula 45 which allows<br>
rotation of the shaft.<br>
54	Diathermy connector.<br>
23<br><br>
One of trie types of the conventional curved dissector consists of a scissors type handle (40) having a slot (41) as depicted in fig. 09. This slot accommodates the globular end of the push rod (42) but allows its free rotational movement. The body of the handle is fixed with the help of a screw (43) to a canula (52) through which the push-rod passes. A diathermy connector (54) is also attached to the body of the handle. This canula (52) is connected to the shaft of the instrument (45) with the help of an 'apposition lock' (53)s which allows its free rotation. A convenient size rotator (44) is attached to the shaft of the instrument (45) so that the shaft of the instrument along with its working tip (46, 47) can be rotated freely with the index finger while the thumb and the ring finger operates the scissors type handle. The canula (45) which forms the shaft of the instrument, is insulated throughout (45a) except at the working tip, the hinge joint and the push rod. The other working tip (48) is fixed with the canula shaft (45).<br>
The abc ve-mentioned instrument has been modified as herein described:<br>
A 14 / 16 gauge metal pipeline (H.D. channel, 49a, 49b) is attached along the shaft of the instrument (45) deep to its insulation (45a). Distaliy, this canula is also attached to the surface of the fixed jaw of the instrument tip (48) where it opens near the tip. The tip of this hydro-dissection canula (49a) is either blunt &amp; curved or blunt &amp; straight. The proximal end of this H.D. canula (49b)<br>
24<br><br>
passes through the rotator as depicted in fig, 09 and comes out to the surface after a bend. Once it comes out to the surface, it is connected to a stopcock (50), which can be operated by a lever (50a) with the help of the index finger. The stopcock (50) is connected to the high pressure normal saline / isotonic salt solution jet pipeline with the help of a connector (51). Thus, the high pressure normal saline" / isotonic salt solution jet from the above said device (fig, 02) may pass through the stopcock (50) when it is open, then pass through the H.D. normal saline / isotonic salt solution jet channel (49b, 49a) embedded inside the rotator (44), shaft of the instrument (45) deep to its insulation (45a), ultimately to be delivered through the tip at the surface of the fixed jaw (47) of the operating tip.<br><br>
