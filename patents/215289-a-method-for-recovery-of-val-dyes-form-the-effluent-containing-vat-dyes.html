				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The present invention describes a method of recovery of vat dye, particularly indigo dye, from the effluents of vat dyeing processes. The method/process of recovery of indigo dye involves treatment of effluents with aqueous solution of copolymers comprising of a mixture of acrylamide and dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate for 15-60 min; separation of copolymer dye complex from effluents; reduction of copolymer dye complex with a reducing agent such as &amp;quot;Rongalite C&amp;quot; for 4-7 h and subsequent solubilization with caustic hydro solution for release of indigo dye for recycle/reuse in textile industry. Indigo dye recovered by this process is 80%. Further the present invention also describes a method for safe disposal of the residual effluent wherein the copolymer dye complex has been separated. This process involves the treatment of effluent with hydrogen peroxide. This results in 90-95% reduction color intensity, which is suitable for direct disposal. This invention also brings forth the use of aqueous solution of safe copolymers for treatment of effluents for recovery of vat dyes particularly indigo dye, which has extensive application in denim industry. No biological material is being employed.</td>

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Vat dyes find their applications in the textile industry and are most commonly used dyes. Among the classes of vat dyes, indigo represents the most widely used dye in the denim industry. Indigo has limitation of low exhaustion on cotton, which results in the release of major percentage of vat dye, particularly of indigo in the waste water from most of the vat dyeing processes, particularly from indigo dyeing processes and such waste water from the vat dyeing processes, particularly from indigo dyeing processes contains significant quantity of the dye, that is about 20 to 30% of the initial amount. Since, the vat dye, particularly the indigo dye is very expensive, its recovery from the waste water, hereinafter referred to as effluent, might make the dyeing process extermely useful and economical. Further, the requirement of the textile industry is that the recovered vat dye, particularly the indigo dye should be suitable for recycling, that is should be suitable for reuse for subsequent dyeing processes.<br><br>
Various products and the methods employing such developed products have been developed to recover the vat dye, particularly the indigo dye from the effluents containing the vat dye, particularly the indigo dye. Such known methods and products for recovery of the vat dye, particularly the indigo dye also have one or the other drawback. One set of products, particularly copolymers, more particularly copolymers of acrylamide and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate have been developed by the inventors of the present invention, which have been disclosed in the copending patent application number 3603/DEL/1998. The present invention is intended to disclose a method for recovery of vat dyes from the effluents containing vat dyes, particularly a method for recovery of indigo dye from the effluents containing indigo dye, more particularly a method for recovery of indigo dye by way of copolymers, as disclosed in our copending patent application number 3603/DEL/1998, from the effluents containing indigo dye<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
