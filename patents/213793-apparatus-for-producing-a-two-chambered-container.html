				<td>APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING A TWO-CHAMBER CONTAINER<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus for producing two-chamber containers,<br>
with an inner mandrel and an outer mandrel, wherein the inner mandrel can be<br>
inserted into and withdrawn from the outer mandrel, a die cavity for a cap and a<br>
material feeder for supplying a heated portion of a thermoplastic polymer<br>
material into the die cavity of a compression mould.<br>
The two chamber container can be used for example:<br>
- for a two-component -glue;<br>
- for a Night and Day skin-care products in one tube;<br>
- for a toothpaste;<br>
- other components which are mixed only when they are used, as the contact of<br>
the compounds cause a chemical reaction.<br>
A device of this type is known from US-A-5 219 373. Here two separately<br>
produced one-piece tubes with different diameters are pushed onto their<br>
corresponding inner or outer mandrel respectively; a cap with common outlet<br>
aperture is provided by means of injection moulding owing to a nozzle piece and<br>
is simultaneously connected to both tube ends. This method is time consuming<br>
as a result of the many individual steps and therefore does not allow a high<br>
number of pieces to be produced per unit of time, in particular as the tubes are<br>
initially produced individually and have to be introduced into the device in a<br>
coordinated manner.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a device for producing two-chamber<br>
containers, in particular as non-resealable disposable packaging, which looks<br>
nice and can be produced simply and quickly.<br>
To achieve this object, the present invention provides an apparatus for producing<br>
a two-chamber container, comprising an inner mandrel and an outer mandrel,<br>
wherein the inner mandrel is insertable into and withdrawable from the outer<br>
mandrel, a die cavity for the cap of the container, and a material feeder for<br>
supplying a heated portion of a thermoplastic polymer material into the die cavity<br>
of a compression mould, characterised by a first device for winding a film around<br>
the driven-out inner mandrel and a second device for winding a film around the<br>
outer mandrel and advanceable welding devices to produce longitudinal side<br>
seams to produce tubes, said mandrels being insertable into and withdrawable<br>
from the die cavity of the compression mould to produce a cap with a seal and<br>
for connection to the walls of the chambers formed; and each mandrel having a<br>
projection in the direction of the die cavity for forming a channel in the cap<br>
connected to respective chambers.<br>
In advantageous development, the advanceable welding device has two<br>
opposing and pivotable welding jaws, and each jaw has two jaw projections<br>
separated by a gap, a cutting device being insertable into and withdrawable from<br>
the common gap.<br><br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an<br>
embodiment of a device for producing two-chamber containers. In the<br>
accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a two-chamber container in side view;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the two-chamber container illustrated in Fig. 1 in plan view from<br>
above;<br>
Fig. 3 shows an apparatus or device for producing the two-chamber container in<br>
a schematic view;<br>
Figs. 4a, 4b, 4c show a mandrel system and its interaction with a pressing tool;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a view from above of the mandrel system with tubes;<br>
Fig. 6 shows the supply of a strip of film around a mandrel for producing a side<br>
seam;<br>
Fig. 7 shows the formation of a side seam on a film wound round a mandrel and<br>
its separation from the strip of film.<br>
The two-chamber container illustrated in Fig. 1 in the form of a disposable<br>
packaging for two components which are to be stored separately from one<br>
another but are to be used together, has an inner chamber 1 and an outer<br>
chamber 2 surrounding it, a cap 3 and a fastening seam 4 produced different<br>
only after filling of the chambers 1 and 2 with different filling components, which<br>
fastening seam seals the chambers 1, 2 at the end remote from the cap 3 while<br>
separating them from one another.<br><br>
The cap 3 has a shoulder 5 which, according to Fig. 2, has a laterally flattened,<br>
rounded cross-section which can also be rounded so as to be circular or oval.<br>
The cap 3 also has a - in this case central - neck 6 in which two channels 71, 72<br>
(Fig. 1) are formed, of which one in each case is connected to one of the<br>
chambers 1 or 2. A seal 8 is attached to the neck 6, which seal is designed in<br>
the embodiment as a twist-off seal 9". There is a predetermined breaking point<br>
10 on part or entire periphery of the neck 6 in order to facilitate twisting off. The<br>
twist-off seal 91 is preferably designed in such a way that when it is broken and<br>
thus exposes the openings of the channels 71, 72, it remains connected to the<br>
cap 3, in other words, it does not have to be disposed of separately.<br>
The chamber 1 is produced from a tubular film 11 with smaller diameter and the<br>
outer surrounding chamber 2 from a tubular film 12 with a larger diameter. As<br>
shown clearly in Fig. 1 and 2, the tubular film 11 is secured by a portion of its<br>
wall to the insert 13 arranged centrally in this case, in which the channels 71, 72<br>
are formed, so as to separate them from one another in such a way that each<br>
chamber 1, 2 is connected to only one channel 71 or 72.<br>
The workstations for producing a two-chamber container, as is<br>
described above for example, can be seen in Fig. 3. In<br>
position I a film is wound round an inner mandrel and the<br>
film is welded to form a tube to produce the inner chamber 1. At station 11 a<br><br>
film is wound round an outer mandrel and welded to form a tube<br>
by the production of a side weld seam to produce the outer<br>
chamber 2. The inner tubular film can also be produced at<br>
station II and the outer tubular film at station I. This can<br>
optionally also take place at different heights, wherein both<br>
tubes must at least be transported into one plane. A portion of<br>
material, for example plastics material plasticised by heat, is<br>
supplied to a die cavity at station III. At station IV the inner<br>
mandrel and the outer mandrel are introduced, together with the<br>
inner and outer tube produced, into a die cavity where the cap<br>
is formed from the portion of material and is simultaneously<br>
connected to the two tube ends located in approximately one<br>
plane. Some or all of stations V to VII can be provided as<br>
cooling stations for curing and cooling of the cap. At station<br>
VIII the die is opened and the finished product removed and<br>
transported away. The described allocation of the production<br>
stages to the stations is to be considered as an example. Any<br>
other allocation of the processing stages is also possible.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an outer mandrel 14 in which an inner mandrel 15 is<br>
arranged so it can be inserted and withdrawn. The outer die of<br>
the outer mandrel 14 corresponds to the inner die of the outer<br>
chamber 2 and that of the inner mandrel 15 to that of the inner<br>
chamber 1 (see Fig. 5 also) . The inner mandrel 15 and the outer<br>
mandrel 14 have cylindrical mandrel projections 161, 162 which<br>
are provided in the cap 3 to be attached to form the channels 71,<br>
72 (see Fig. 1). When the inner mandrel 15 has been driven in the<br>
direction of the arrow in Fig. 4a out of the outer mandrel 14<br>
into its external end position, a strip of film or a portion<br>
thereof is wound round the driven-out inner mandrel 15 to form a<br>
tube which is sealed by a side seam 17, preferably by welding.<br>
The side seam 17 can be produced as an overlapping seam or - as<br><br>
illustrated - as a parallel seam, wherein the start and the end of the film winding<br>
round the mandrel are aligned parallel to one another and then welded to one<br>
another for example by means of supplied welding tongs. With such an<br>
embodiment of the side seam 17 with parallel edges, the outer mandrel has a<br>
recess 18 (Fig. 5) which serves to receive the side seam 17 (Fig. 5) projecting<br>
somewhat radially when the inner mandrel 15 is retracted into the outer mandrel<br>
14 (see Fig. 4b).<br>
In the position shown in Fig. 4b, both the inner mandrel 15 and the outer mandrel<br>
14 provided with a side seam carry tubular films 11, 12 which project slightly<br>
beyond the free ends of the respective mandrels 14 and 15. The mandrels 14,<br>
15 equipped with tubular films 11, 12 in this way are simultaneously fed with their<br>
free ends into a die cavity 9 (Fig. 4c) which reproduces the external form of a cap<br>
3 with seal 8 which is to be moulded on. A portion of plasticised material, from<br>
which the cap 3 is to be produced, has previously been fed into the die cavity 9.<br>
Owing to a movement of the mandrels 14, 15 into the die cavity 9 or of the die<br>
cavity 9 towards the mandrels 14, 15 or a common movement of mandrels 14,<br>
15 and die cavity 9 towards one another, the cap 3 is moulded on by<br>
compression of the portion of material. In the process, the channel 71 associated<br>
with the inner chamber 1 is formed by means of the projecting mandrel<br>
projection 161 and accordingly the channel 72 of the outer chamber 2 is formed<br>
by the mandrel projection 162.<br><br>
Fig. 6 and 7 show schematically the production of a tube. The production<br>
process illustrated is suitable in particular for very thin films, for example 75<br>
micrometres (0.075 millimetres) thick. Such a strip of film 21 arranged on a roller<br>
20 is guided over two rotatable fixed deflecting rollers 22, 23 and the start of the<br>
strip is wound onto a spool 24. A mandrel 14 or 15, arranged on a turntable, for<br>
example, can be inserted between the two deflection rollers 22, 23 in such a way<br>
that it deflects the strip of film 21 (see Fig. 6) and is partially covered by it. In a<br>
certain position of the mandrel 14 and 15 with the deflected strip of film 21, the<br>
two welding jaws 19 pivot inwards and, have a shape which is such that the<br>
mandrel 14, 15 is completely covered by the strip of film 21. Each welding jaw<br>
19, 19" has jaw projections 26 which are separated, i. e. provided with a gap 25.<br>
The shape of the jaw projections 26 is chosen such that the strip of film 21<br>
covers the respective mandrel 14 or 15 completely and lies with two lateral<br>
edges parallel to one another, which lateral edges project perpendicular to the<br>
mandrel surface. A side seam of the adjacent lateral edges of the strip of film 21<br>
is welded and formed by the welding jaws 19, 191 lying opposite one another.<br>
The side seam formed between the opposing welding jaws 19, 19" is divided by<br>
means of a knife 27 which can be introduced into the gap 25 between the jaw<br>
projections 26 and 26" which are spaced apart from one another, in such a way<br>
that one portion produces the side seam itself and one portion remains<br>
connected to the strip of film 21 and can be wound on the spool 24.<br><br>
In the embodiment shown, in the inwardly pivoted state of the welding jaws 19,<br>
19", the retaining device for the knife 27 can be introduced into a guide in one of<br>
the welding jaws 19, 19" and can be moved up and down in the gap 25 of both<br>
welding jaws 19, 19", the previously welded side seam being divided, as<br>
described above.<br>
When the welding jaws 19, 19" are pivoted away from the mandrel 14, 15 the<br>
mandrel 14, 15 now provided with a tube 11, 12 can be transported to the next<br>
workstation. The connected strip of film 21 can be clamped between the<br>
deflecting rollers 22, 23 (dashed line in Fig. 6) with the separated side seam<br>
portions 28 by the drive of the spool 24. A further portion of the. strip of film 21 is<br>
unwound from the spool 20, which portion is then looped again - as described<br>
above - by the mandrel 14" (Fig. 6) that follows on the turntable for example, and<br>
can be provided with a side weld seam. By dividing the side seam formed a<br>
continuous strip remains which can be gradually wound onto the spool 24 and<br>
partially consists of the fresh strip of film 21 and partially of a portion of strip<br>
which has been divided up and comprises the side seam portions 28.<br>
The advantage of this solution lies in the fact that despite the side seam being<br>
cut by the knife 27 there is always a continuous strip which can be guided with a<br>
controllable tension by pulling (spool 24) and optionally with additional<br>
deceleration of the spool 20.<br><br>
The corresponding welding devices and film guides can be arranged at different<br>
heights to produce the inner tube and the outer tube, can be height adjustable<br>
and/or optionally arranged so as to also be axially displaceable or pivotable.<br>
With sufficient rigidity, for example in a stronger, thicker film, winding round a<br>
mandrel can also take place in that an overlapping seam (not shown) can be<br>
provided which can be produced so as to be bonded, for example by applying an<br>
adhesive or a double-sided adhesive strip, or welded, for which purpose suitable<br>
supply and adhesion or welding devices and optionally cutting devices as well<br>
would have to be provided, which are all so familiar to a person skilled in the art<br>
that they do not need to be described in more detail here.<br><br>
