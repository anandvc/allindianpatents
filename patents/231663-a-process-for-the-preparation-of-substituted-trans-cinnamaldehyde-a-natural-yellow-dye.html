				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to "A process for the preparation of substituted trans-cinnamaldehyde, a natural yellow dye, from phenylpropane derivatives" in which trans-cinnamaldehyde (e.g. 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde where RI is -CH=CH-CHO, R2 = R4 = R5 is -OMe and R3=R6 is H; p-methoxycinnamaldehyde where RI is -CH=CH-CHO, R2= R3= R5= R6 is H, R4 is -OMe and 3,4-dimethoxycinnamaldehyde where R, is -CH=CH-CHO, R2= R5= R6 is H and R3= R4 is -OMe etc) of the formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
can be obtained by oxidation of (R2-R3-R4-R5-R6)phenylpropane derivatives (wherein R2 to R6 equal or different, being hydrogen or hydroxy or alkyl or methylenedioxy or alkoxy groups, etc) which is, in fact, a reduced product of readily available natural phenylpropene (methyl chavicol, anethole, eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, safrole, toxic p-asarone etc) bearing essential oil or the like. Background of the invention<br>
Cinnamaldehyde and its substituted derivatives (e.g. p-methoxy cinnamaldehyde, 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamic aldehyde, coniferyl aldehyde etc) possess an aromatic ring bearing one or more hydroxy or dioxymethylene or alkoxy groups or the like, attached to the a,p-unsaturated aldehyde (i.e. CH=CH-CHO) which contribute significantly to the taste and flavour of many foods and drinks (Harborne, J.B. and Baxter, H., In: Phytochemical Dictionary, A Handbook of Bioactive Compounds from Plants, Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd., London WC1N 2ET, 472-488 (1993)). In addition, cinnamaldehyde derivatives serve as a rSw material for the preparation of a number of other perfumery aromatics. Morever, the selective reduction of the aldehyde group gives cinriamyl alcohol which possesses a pleasant and long-lasting spicy odor and complete reduction of the side chain gives phenyl propyl alcohol and its oxidation give hydrocinnamic acid (Muller, A.J., Bowers Jr, J.S., Eubanks, J.R., Geiger, C.C. and Santobianco, J.G., U.S. Pat. No. 5939581)) which, along with its ester, finds usage in perfumery composition. Cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives are not only<br>
found to be highly effective to prevent skin from darkening caused by irradiation of ultraviolet rays from the sun (Tomoshi, K. and Makoto, F., JP Pat. No. 58055414A2)) but also proved to be excellent in preventing falling-off of hair and also provide hair growth (Watanabe, T., Komeno, T. and Hatanaka, M., JP Pat. No. 6312916A2)). In addition, cinnamaldehyde in combination with the manure controls injurious microorganisms present in soil without any adverse effect on manure-decomposing microorganisms (Saotome, K., JP Pat. No. 58201703A2)). Further, cinnamaldehyde derivatives are useful as an intermediate for synthesis of various drugs such as anti-viral Pharmaceuticals, particularly HIV protease inhibitors (Castelijns, A.M.C.F., Hogeweg, J.M. and van Nispen, S.P.J.M., U.S. Pat. No. 5811588) and also used in cosmetics, dyes, agrochemicals, alkaloids (Parmar, V.S., Jain, S.C., Bisht, K.S., Jam, R., Taneja, P., Jha, A., Tyagi, O.D., Prasad, A.K., Wengel, J., Olsen, C.E. and Boll, P.M., Phytochemistry, 46(4): 597-673 (1997)), perfumes, etc.<br>
Cinnamaldehyde is identified for the first time in the year 1833 during steam distillation of Ceylon bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum, family: Lauraceae) which is still one of the main source of cinnamaldehyde. It also occurs in dozens of flowers and essential oils such as Hyacinthus spp., Narcissus spp., Lavandula spp., Pogostemon cabline and Commiphora spp. and others. However, substituted cinnamaldehyde (coniferyl aldehyde or coniferaldehyde or ferula aldehyde or ferulaldehyde) occurs in a number of other plants such as Quercus spp., Acer saccharinum which, imparts a phenolic-spicy, sweet balsamic odour and is used extensively in flavour compositions. Similarly, sinapaldehyde (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamaldehyde) occurs in Juglans nigra, Senra incana and p-methoxy-cinnamaldehyde in Acorns gramineu etc. Mostly, substituted cinnamaldehydes are yellow in color; therefore, the applicability of cinnamaldehyde can be further increased with the possibities of their uses in the area of natural dyes. However, the limited percentage of substituted cinnamaldehydes present in the plant kingdom is not sufficient to fulfill the world demand. As a result, the major amounts of cinnamaldehydes are made synthetically.<br>
A number of proceses have been proposed to produce cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives (such as p-methoxycinnamaldehyde, dimethoxycinnamaldehyde, sinapaldehyde, trimethoxycinnamaldehyde and methylenedioxy cinnamaldehyde etc). For the most part, these methods involve reaction of the substituted benzaldehyde (such as p-methoxybenzaldehyde etc) with acetaldehyde in the presence of acid or better with alkali. Cinnamaldehyde can also be prepared by hydrolysis of cinnamylidene chloride. Good yields have been obtained by the Rosenmund reduction of cinnamic acid chloride with palladinium<br>
catalyst (March, J., In: Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, Wiley Eastern Ltd., New Delhi, 396-397, (1987)). Catalytic dehydrogenation of cinnamic alcohol at high temperature under reduced pressure has given good yields of cinnamaldehyde. Dry distillation of the calcium salts of cinnamic and formic acid also yields aldehyde. Isomerization of phenylethynyl carbinol in the presence of acid produces good yields of aldehyde. A practical method of producing a range of a,p-unsaturated aldehyde is to treat an olefm with carbon monoxide under pressure and in the presence of a catalyst (Brown, H.C. and Tsukamoto, A., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 86: 1089 (1964)) and Bedoukian, P.Z., In: Perfumery and Flavoring Synthetics, Allured Publishing Corporation, Wheaton, IL, USA, 98-105 (1986)). Though such methods have been proven to be useful, they suffer from one or more process deficiencies. For example, in some instances processes of this type necessarily involve resort to sub-ambient temperatures, which of course, involves some considerable process control and in some cases, the reaction is effected only at a relatively high pressures and lead to reaction mixtures.<br>
Typical prior art references include U.S. Pat Nos 2,529,186; 2,794,813; 3,028,419 and German Patent Nos. 97,620; 1,114,798 and Soviet Union Pat. No. 1451139A1 and Czechoslovakia Pat. No. 8405411 Al.<br>
It, therefore, becomes an object of invention to provide a process for producing<br>
cinnamaldehydes such as p-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 3,4-dimethoxycinnamaldehyde, 3,4-<br>
methylenedioxycinnamaldehyde, 3,4-methylenedioxy-5-methoxycinnamaldehyde, 1 -ethoxy-<br>

Phenylpropanoids (C6-C3) comprises of the compounds in which derivatives of phenylpropene, phenylpropanone, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamal alcofiol, cjnnamic acid and ester are found to be biologically active and have commercial importance. Among these<br>
phenylpropanoids, the (R2-R3-R4-R5-R6) cinnamaldehyde derivatives wherein R2 to R6equal or different, being hydrogen or hydroxy or melhylenedioxy or alkoxy groups, etc are frequently present in the essential oil.  As per applications concern, these cinnamaldehydes are widely used in fragrance, flavour, cosmetic, liquor and in Pharmaceuticals, etc and are also utilized as pheromones, antibacterial, antifungal etc in the insect world. The wide use of cinnamaldehydes (F.E.M.A. no. 2286)   ranging from flavouring agents to Pharmaceuticals and their importance as an intermediate in the synthesis of biologically active compounds ~have always   attracted attention of chemists (Muller, A.J., Bowers Jr, J.S., Eubanks, J.R., W      Geiger, C.C. and Santobianco, J.G, U.S.  Pat.  No.  5939581  and Castelijns, A.M.C.F., -•         3 Hogeweg, J.M. and van Nispen, S.P.J.M., U.S. Pat. No. 5811588)).  The principal source of cinnamaldehyde (synonyms: cinnamic aldehyde or 3-phenylpropenal or cinnamal or gamma-]     phenylacrolein or cassia aldehyde) is the bark of cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum; •     Lauraceae) and its fresh bark contains high levels of cinnamyl acetate which releases cinnamaldehyde  by  fermentation  processes  applied  during  commercial  preparation  by enzymatic hydrolysis and participation of the reversible aldehyde-alcohol oxidoreductase. Cinnamon leaf, on the other hand, contains large amounts of eugenol and much smaller amounts of cinnamaldehyde.  Similarly, another source of cinnamaldehyde is  Cinnamomum cassia which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (Tang, W. and Eisenbrand, G. In: Chinese Drugs of Plant Origin, Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 319-330 (1992)) as an analgesic, stomachic and anti-inflammatory agent and its activity is found due to high percentage of cinnamaldehyde (85%). In addition, cinnamaldehyde has shown anti-mutagenic activity towards chemical mutagens or UV irradiation (Kakimuma, K., Koike, J., Kotanik, K., Ikekawa, W., Kado, T. and Nomoto, M., Agric. Biol. Chem. 48: 1905-1906 (1984); Ohta, T., Watanabe, K., Moriya, M., Shirasu, Y., Kada,  L, Mutat. Res.,  107: 219-227 (1983)). Cinnamaldehyde at a concentration of 4.8 fig/ml inhibited the growth of L 1210 leukemia cells in culture by 50% and its aldehydydic group is found to be responsible for the above inhibition.   Cinnmaldehyde also inhibited the growth of SV40-induced tumor W2K-11 in mice (CA 94: 168054k and Moon, K.H., Pack, M.Y~ Drug Chem., Toxicol,, 6: 521-535 (1983)).<br>
Similarly, a number of substituted cinnamaldehydes such as ortho-methoxy cinnamaldehyde (synonym: ortho-cumeric aldehyde methyl ether), para-methoxy cinnamaldehyde (synonym: para-cumeric aldehyde methyl ether), 3,4-dimethoxy cinnamic aldehyde (synonyms: homoconiferaldehyde or methyl ferulaldehyde), para-coniferaldehyde<br>
(synonyms: ferulaldehyde or maple aldehyde or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamic aldehyde), 3,4-methylenedioxycinnamic aldehyde (synonyms: piperonyl acrolein or heliotropylidene acetaldehyde or piperonylidene acetaldehyde), sinapaldehyde (synonym: 2,4-dimethoxy-4-hydroxy cinnamic aldehyde) are also widely used in flavour compositions, however, the odour of these substituted cinnamaldehydes bears a little organoleptic resemblance to that of cinnamaldehyde. In addition, some substituted cinnamaldehydes are known for their biological activities. 2'-hydroxycinnamaldehyde inhibits farnesyl-protein transferase (FPTase) (Knon, B.M.; Cho, Y.K., Lee, S.H., Nam, J.Y., Bok, S.H., Chun, S.K., Kim, J.A. and Lee, I.R., Planta Medica, 62: 183-184 (1996)) and also acts as active anticancer compound (Lee, C.W., Hong, D.H., Han, S.B., Park, S.H., Kim, H.K., Kwon, B.M. and Kim, H.M., Planta Medica, 65: 263-266 (1999)). 3',4'-dimethoxyc)nnamaldehyde reduces the contractile response of guinea pig ileal strips to LTD4. Similarly, substituted cinnamaldehyde such as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamaldehyde is a potent antioxidant compound (Kikuzaki, H., Hara, S., Kawai, Y. and Nakatani, N., Phytochemistry, 52, 1307-1312 (1999)) and also found as an inducible nitric oxide synthesis (iNOS) inhibitory compound (Kim, N.Y., Pae, H.O., Ko, Y.S., Yoo, J.C., Choi, B.M., Jun, C.D., Chung, H.T., Inagaki, M., Higuchi, R. and Kim, Y.C., Planta, Medica, 65, 656-658 (1999)). However, substituted cinnamic aldehyde are found in traces in plants kingdom and alternatively, they can be obtained by chemical synthesis. Some of the important methods are:<br>
(a)	reaction of substituted benzene derivative with nitroso dimethylaniline in the presence<br>
of mineral acid and catalyst (CA 51, 7326 (1957).<br>
(b)	condensation of vinyl ether with arylaldehyde acetal (Friedrich and Hartmann, Chem.<br>
Ber., 94, 838(1961).<br>
(c)	reaction of Grignard of bromobenzene with l-(N-Methylanilino)propen-3-al (Jutz,<br>
Ger. Pat. 1,114,798, Oct. 12, (1961).<br>
W)       reaction of appropriate olefin with carbon monoxide under pressure and in the presence of catalysts (U.S. Pat. 3,028,419, April 3, (1962)).<br>
(e)	claisen-Schmidt reaction of arylaldehyde with acetaldehyde offers cinnamaldehyde in<br>
the range of 12 to 30% depending upon the arylaldehyde used.  The low yield of this<br>
reaction product is, perhaps, due to self-condensation of acetaldehyde (Richmond,<br>
U.S. Patent, 2,529,186, Nov. 7, (1950).<br>
(f)	reaction of arylaldehyde with triethyl phosphonoacetate followed by reduction of ethyl<br>
cinnamate with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) to corresponding cinnamyl alcohol<br>
and then oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol with MnCh into cinnamaldehyde ( Rajasekhar,<br>
D. and Subbaraju, G.V. Indian. J. Chem. 38, 837-838 (1999)).   However, this is a<br>
multistep process and requires expensive reagents, (g)      reaction  of cinnamic   acid   with  thionyl   chloride   followed   by  reduction  with<br>
bis(triphenylphosphine)tetrahydroborate copper (El-Feraly, F.S. and Hoffstetter, M.D.<br>
J.Nat. Prod. 43,407(1980). (h)       reaction of arylaldehyde with  poisonous potassium cyanide reagent (Deuchert, S.K.,<br>
Hertenstein, U. and Hunig, S., Synthesis, 777 (1973). (i)       reaction of N,N-dimethylbenzamide with lithium diethoxyaluminium hydride (Perun,<br>
T.J., Zeftel, L, Nelb, R.G. and Tarbell, D.S., J. Org. Chem., 28, 2937 (1963).<br>
All the above methods have various limitations, for example, low yield, expensive reagents and formation of unwanted side products. It is rather curious that in spite of very large quantities of cinnamaldehyde manufactured annually, the chemical and patent literatures on the subject of its manufacture are quite meager. Keeping in view of all the above problem, we have invented a simple industrial process for preparation of substituted cinnamaldehyde in a single step from phenylpropane. To the best of our knowledge, oxidation of phenylpropane derivatives into substituted cinnamaldehyde derivatives have not been reported earlier. This simple starting material can be obtained by reduction of double bond of phenylpropenes bearing essential oil (such as methyl chavicol, anethole, methyl eugenol, safrole, p-asarone etc). In addition, phenylpropane derivatives can be prepared by Grignard reaction of benzyl chloride derivatives with diethyl sulphate (Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol 1, pp 471). However, it is worthwhile to mention that our above process for the preparation of substituted cinnamaldehyde has been invented during the development of a process for the preparation of pharmacological active trans-phenylpropene (a-asarone) (Janusz, P., Bozena, L., Alina, T.D., Barbara, L., Stanislaw, W., Danuta, S., Jacek, P., Roman, K., Jacek, C., Malgorzata, S., Zdzislaw, C., J. Med. Chem., 43, 3671-3676 (2000)) from 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane, a reduced product of toxic p-asarone.<br>
Phenylpropenes, widely used in fragrance, flavour, cosmetic, liquor, whisky, and pharmaceutical industries, exist in three isomeric form (i.e.ot, p and y), however, cis-isomeric form of phenylpropene (such as p-asarone) has been recently proved to be carcinogenic and toxic (Taylor, J. M., Jones, W. I., Hogan, E. C., Gross, M. A., David, D. A. and Cook, E. L., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 10: 405 (1967); Keller, K.; Oderithal, K. P. and Leng, P. E., Planta Medica, 1: 6-9 (1985) and Kim, S.C., Liem, A., Stewart, B.C. and Miller, J.A.,<br>
Carcinogensis, 20(7), 1303-1307 (1999)) and therefore, banned for any kind of use in flavour, perfumery and pharmaceutical industries. Cis-anethol is found to be 15 times more toxic than trans-anethol.   Similarly,   y-isomeric form of phenylpropene (such as safrole) is also found carcinogenic (Daimon, H., Sawada, S., Asakura, S. and Sagami, F., Carcinogenesis, 19(1): 141-146, (1998) and Liu, T.Y., Chen, C.C., Chen, C.L. and Chi, C.W., Food &amp; Chemical Toxicology, 37(7): 697-702, (1999). In view of above problem, most affected plant is Acorus calamus (family: Araceae) in which percentage of toxic P-asarone depends upon the varieties of A. calamus (Riaz, M., Shadab, Q., Chaudhary, F. M, Hamdard Medicus 38(2): 50-62 (1995) and McGuffm, M., Hobbs, C., Upton, R. and Goldberg, A., In: American Herbal Products Association's Botanical Safety Handbook, CRC Press, Inc.; Boca Raton, Florida; USA, 231, (1997)).   The content of (3-asarone in the triploid variety is 8-19 %, while P-asarone reaches upto 96% in the tetraploid and hexaploid varieties (extensively found in Asian countries).  In contrast,  p-asarone is not found in the diploid variety.  As a result, the calamus oil    obtained from North American diploid strain (zero,   P-asarone) and East European triploid strain   (upto 12 % p-asarone) are allowed for clinical effectiveness and safety while the calamus oil produced in Asian belt (such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Japan and China) has diminished the market potential of calamus oil due to high percentage of  p-asarone ranging from    70 to 96% (Mazza, G., J. of Chromatography 328:179-206 (1985); Nigam, M. C., Ateeque, A.., Misra, L. N. and Ahmad, A., Indian Perfumer 34: 282-285 (1990) and Bonaccorsi, I., Cortroneo, A., Chowdhury, J. U. and Yusuf, M., Essenze Derv. Agrum, 67(4): 392-402 (1997)). Therefore, our objective is to utilize toxic P-asarone (cis-2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-l-propene) as a simple starting material for value added products via its reduced product (2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane) which has recently been found useful as a new aroma molecule with atleast six to four times less toxic than P-asarone or calamus oil (Sinha, A.K., U.S. Pat. No. 09, 652376 filed 31 August 31, (2000)). Further, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane appeared to us as a simple intermediate for the preparation of trans-2,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl-l-propene (a-asarone).<br>
Interestingly, 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane when treated with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) furnished a-asarone (compared with standard a-asarone) and an intense yellow coloured spot with some unreacted starting material (clearly visible on TLC plate). Increase in the amount of DDQ further favoured the formation of yellow colouring material rather than the a-asarone. All three products were separated on column chromatography in which yellow solid (mp 140 ° C) showed IR absorption band at 1648 cm"1<br>
(conjugated C=O)   and also gave positive 2,4-DNP test, thus, confirming the presence of carbonyl group.     UV spectra of yellow solid     (A.max 244, 298, 366 nm) confirmed an increase in conjugation than the starting material. 2,4,5-trimethoxyphenylpropane (288 nm) and p-asarone (269, 301 nm). 1H NMR (Fig.l) of yellow solid showed the 14 number of protons (see Example I) in which two doublets and one doublet of doublet for three protons appeared at 8  9.65 (1H, d, J=7.8 Hz)t 7.81 (1H, d, J=15.8 Hz) and  6 6.64 (1H, dd, J=15.8 Hz, J=7.8 Hz) respectively.   Further, the position of two aromatic singlet protons and three singlet for nine protons for three trimethoxy groups were more or less at same 5 value as compared to p-asarone (Patra, A. and Mitra, A.K., Phytochemistry, 44: 668-669 (1981)).   IR and 'H NMR has supported the possibility of unsaturated aldehyde group (-CH=CH-CHO) attached with trimethoxy (nine protons) substituted phenyl ring (two protons).   Similarly, the 13C NMR (Fig.2)of the yellow solid that appeared at 6  194.1, 154.1, 153.2, 147.6, 143.3, 126.4, 114.5, 110.5, 96.5, 56.4, 56.2, 56.0 clearly indicated the presence of 12 carbons as similar to the 12 carbons of p-asarone except that the position of side propyl group which appeared at 6 194.1 (C-3'), 154.1 (C-l) and 126.4 (C-2') could be possible due to   p-unsaturated aldehyde (-CH=CH-CHO) group.  The El mass spectrum (Fig.3) of yellow solid showed a clear [M]f peak at m/z 222.  On the basis of above spectral data, the yellow solid was postulated to be 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde as a trans-isomer (Example I).   The formation of this unexpected trans-2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde was finally confirmed by its  (i)  oxidation   with  neutral     KMnO4 in  the  cold  acetone  to  well  known  2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde (Example II) (Birch, A.J., Jackson, A.H., Shannon, P.V.R. and Steward,  G.W.,  Journal  of Chemical  Society Perkin Trans  I,  2492-2501,  (1973)  and Starkovsky, N.A., Journal of Organic Chemistry, 27, 3733-3734, (1962)) (ii) direct oxidation of p-asarone with selenium dioxide (Liu M C, Lin T S &amp; Sartorelli A C, J Med Chem, 35, 3672 (1992)) into 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde (Example III) and its comparison with reported natural cinnamaldehyde.   Treatment of p-asarone with selenium dioxide and few drop of base such as pyridine, triethylamine etc in dioxane gave two distinguished spots on TLC plate in which one yellow spot is expected for 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde while minor spot for corresponding cinnamyl alcohol derivative as clearly confirmed by the absorbance of peak at 1648 (carbonyl) and 3480 (hydroxyl group) in IR spectra.  The latter was formed even when the amount of selenium dioxide was increased up to 1.3 equiv. Formation of side product alcohol are common with aldehyde 'during the allylic oxidation of several analogs of p-asarone with Se02. However, we observed that without any separation,<br>
treatment of the mixture of cinnamaldehyde and cinnamyl alcohol with pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) (Lin, S. J., Short, R. E., Ford., S. P., Grings, E. E. and Rasazza, P. N., J Nat Prod, 61, 51-56 (1998)) afforded 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde as a single spot since alcohol got oxidized into cinnamaldehyde. The 'H-NMR spectral data of cinnamaldehyde is similar to the reported natural (Kulkarni, M.M., Sohani, J., Rojatkar, S. R. and Nagasampagi, B. A., Indian J. Chem., 25B: 981-982 (1986)) and its 13C-NMR spectral data is reported here for the first time. Thus, isolation and characterization of above cinnamaldehyde has opened a new route to prepare several substituted cinnamaldehydes in a single step starting from phenylpropane derivatives.<br>
After successful assignment of substituted cinnamaldehyde, our main attention was focused on to increase the percentage of cinnamaldehyde (a natural dye) as demand of natural colourants over synthetic ones are increasing worldwide due to their safer and ecofriendly nature. Thus, we observed that treatment of phenylpropane with DDQ ranging from 1 to 20 moles (preferably  1.5 to 8 moles) afford mainly cinnamaldehyde.      The formation of unsaturated aldehyde from saturated propane side chain is possible only via initial formation of  phenylpropene   which   further   undergo   oxidation   and   lead   to   the   formation   of cinnamaldehyde in a single step.   The yield of cinnamaldehyde may be further increased by using the catalysts such as mineral acid (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid) or Cu (I) or Fe(III) salt or periodic acid or organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, ion exchange resin such as IR-120H, a sulphonated polystyrene resin, para-toluenesulphonic acid (PTSA) etc. The formation of cinnamaldehyde can be carried out in a short time by adsorbing the  solution  of  l-Propyl-2,4,5-trimethoxybenzene  and  oxidising  reagent  DDQ  on  the following solid support namely celite, silica gel, molecular sieve, alumina under microwave irradiation (Posner, G.H. and Rogers, D.Z. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 99, 8208 (1997); Jr. Filippo, J.S. and Chem, C.I. J. Org. Chem. 42, 2182 (1979) (Example IV) for 40 second to 20 minutes, preferably 2 to 12 minutes. It is worthwhile to mention that among several oxidizing reagents (such as manganese dioxide or p-chloranil    or Pyridinium chlorochromate or tBuOOH CrO}), DDQ is found as a powerful dehydrogenating (Sondengam, B.L. and Kimbu, S.F., Tetrahedron Letters, 1: 69-70, (1977) and Guy, A.; Lemaire, M. and Guette, J.P., Chem. Commun. 8 (1980)) and oxidizing reagent (Becker, H. D. J. Org Chem. 30, 982 (1965)) which converts phenylproane derivatives into corresponding cinnamaldehydes as a trans-isomer (Lemaira, M., Guy, A. and Imbert, D., Chem. Commun.. 741 (1986) and Ireland, R.E. and Brown, G., Org. synthesis, Coll. Vol.V, 428-431)) in one step.   In addition, the DDQ-<br>
mediated reactions allow to monitor the progress of the reaction as a green-coloured charge transfer (CT)-complex formed, which gradually changes to pink or brown color (as the 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-hydrobenzoquinone crystallized out), indicates the formation of desired products. At the end of the reaction, the precipitated hydrobenzoquinone (DDQH2) can be easily separated by filteration which allow to obtain 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-hydrobenzoquinone (DDQH2) in 90 to 94% yield. The amount of precipitated hydroquinone (DDQH2) can be conveniently converted back to DDQ in good yield by standard methods (Walker, D. and Waugh, T.D., J. Org. Chem. 30, 3240, (1965)). In view of all above, the DDQ-mediated conversion of phenylpropane into cinnamaldehyde appears to be industrially attractive method. In addition, hydrogenated crude calamus oil (asarones present from 70 to 96%) can be used directly for oxidation by DDQ for the preparation of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde is an added benefits since remaining constituents of reduced calamus oil do not interfere during oxidation and the yield was found to be less than just by 5-15 % depending upon asarones percentage in calamus oil. Therefore, this invention makes above process further cost effective.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Thus, our method for the synthesis of substituted cinnamaldehyde is not only simple, cheaper and high yielding but can convert any kind of substituted phenylpropanes which are even prone to acid or base.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The starting material phenylpropane derivatives such as dihydroeugenol (n-Propyl guaiacol), 3,4-Methylenedioxy phenylpropane (dihydrosafrole), 4-Methoxyphenylpropane (dihydroanethole) or the like, can be obtained either from commercial sources or by catalytic hydrogenation of corresponding eugenol, safrole, anethole derivatives respectively (Steffen, A. In: Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, Allured Punlishing Corporation, 362 South Schmale Road, Carol Stream, IL, USA, (1994)). In addition, 2,4,5-Trimethoxyphenylpropane can be obtained via ammonium formate assisted reduction of toxic p-asarone of Acorus calamus or crude calamus oil containing p-asarone (Sinha, A.K., U.S. Pat. No. 09/652,376 filed on August 31, (2000)).<br>

(by thermal method)<br>
A solution of 2,4,5-Trimethoxyphenylpropane (5 g) in 70 mL of dry dioxane was placed in 100 ml round bottom flask. To this was added a catalytic amount of acetic acid (2-4 drops) and 16 g of DDQ and finally started refluxing the mixture at 50 to 140 °C for 5 to 9 hrs. The solution, which was initially deep green, turned into pale yellow with the formation of hydroquinone (DDQF^). The mixture was cooled and the solid DDQH2 was filtered and further washed with chloroform. The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated under reduced pressure. The product was taken in ether (80 ml) and the ether layer was washed with aqueous NaOH (15%, 2 x 15 ml). The combined aqueous layers are further extracted with ether (3 x 15 ml). The ether layers were combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride (3x15 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent<br>
was removed to afford a crude yellow liquid which was loaded on silica gel column and the column was eluted with hexane (70-80 ml) and then with an increasing amount of hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1 to 1:9). The fractions were monitored on TLC plate and the desired fractions were combined and solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 2,4,5-trimethoxy cinnamaldehyde in 82% yield as a yellow solid; mp 140 °C; UV (MeOH) Xrnax 244, 298, 366 nm; IR (film) vmax 1648 (conjugated carbonyl), 1602, 1504, 1466, 1448, 1350, 1254, 1120, 1024, 856 cm-1; 'H NMR 5 9.65 (1H, d, J=7.8 Hz, H-3'), 7.81 (1H, d, J=15.8 Hz, H-1'), 7.03 (1H, s, H-6), 6.64 (1H, dd, J=15.8 Hz, J-7.8 Hz, H-2'), 6.51 (1H, s, H-3), 3.95 (s, 3H, 2-OCH3 ), 3.91 (s, 3H, 4-OCH3), 3.87 (s, 3H, 5-OCH3); 13 C NMR 5 194.1 (C-3'), 154.1 (C-1'), 153.2 (C-2), 147.6 (C-4), 143.3 (C-5), 126.4 (C-2'), 114.5 (C-l), 110.5 (C-6), 96.5 (C-3), 56.4 (5-OCH3), 56.2 (2-OCH3), 56.0 (4-OCH3); EIMS m/z 222 [M]+ (44), 207 (18), 191 (100), 179 (14), 171 (27), 151 (14), 147 (7), 69 (58), 58 (80).<br>

The reaction mixture was left at room temperature for 24 hr, manganese dioxide was filtered off and the solvent was removed. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed carefully with 10% NaHCO3, brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

Example III Synthesis of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde from (3-asarone (by thermal method)<br>
A mixture of p-asarone (1.87 g), selenium dioxide (0.90 g) and dioxane (30 ml) containing 0.3 ml of water was refluxed for 6h. Additional selenium dioxide (0.21 g) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was refluxed for further 12 h. The mixture was cooled<br>

The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was redissolved in CH2Cl2,. washed with brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Evaporation of the solvent afforded a mixture of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde and corresponding alcohol (as formation of side product alcohol is common with aldehyde during the allylic oxidation of several analogs of (3-asarone with SeO2) which was directly treated with excess of pyridinium chlorochromate (I g) in dry CH2Cl2 (50 ml). After being stirred at room temperature for overnight, the reaction mixture was filtered over a short pad of celite. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and residue was column chromatographed over silica gel (petroleum ether/EtOAc 9:1 to 1:9) to give 52% of 2,4,5-trimethoxycinnamaldehyde as a yellow solid; mp 140 °C. TLC, CoTLC, physical and spectral data is exactly the same as above trimethoxycinnamaldehyde (Example I).<br>
Example IV<br>

A mixture of 4-methoxy phenylpropane (2 g), silica gel (0.5- 0.8 g), DDQ (7.5 g) and dioxane (5-8 ml) was taken in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a loose funnel at the top. The flask was placed inside a microwave oven operating at medium power (600 W) and irradiated for 2-8 minutes. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC), the contents of the flask were poured into chloroform and passed through a bed of Celite and further washed with chloroform. The filtrate and washing were combined and the chloroform layers were washed with an aqueous NaOH (15%, 3x15 ml). The combined aqueous layers were further extracted with chloroform (3x15 ml). The chloroform layers were then combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride (3x15 m), dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and filtered. The solvent was removed to afford a crude product which was loaded on silica column and the column was first eluted with hexane (70-80 ml) and then with an increasing amount of hexane/ethyl acetate (9:1 to 1:9). The fractions were monitored on TLC plate and the desired fractions were combined and solvent was removed under vacuum to afford 4-methoxy cinnamaldehyde in 68 % yield as a solid; mp 57-58 °C; (lit. mp 58 °C). The physical and spectral data was found to similar as reported.<br>
