				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a recovery crane, particularly, but without implying any limitation, for lifting and towing wreckage of accidental buses, trucks etc. on highways.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Cranes are basically an equipment for material handling in terms of loading, unloading, transporting and stocking. They are used in all such areas, which require handling of materials such as steel stockyards for handling steel sections, pipes, plates, bars, ingots, sheets etc., construction sites for building of structures, roof repairs, road works and plant maintenance, engineering industries for transportation of machinery and equipment, shipping industry and ports for handling containers, general cargo and pressure vessels, and highway clearance for lifting and dragging of accidental vehicles including trucks and buses.<br>
Depending on the applications, the cranes can be broadly classified into groups like Tower cranes, Gantry cranes, Electric overhead cranes, crawler cranes, Truck mounted cranes, self propelled mobile cranes. Tower cranes are fixed cranes, which are built up of frames and can be used for very high heights to gain access to rooftops and high rise<br>
buildings. Gantry cranes are mobile cranes for shifting heavy load like containers at Ports, docks, etc. Electric overhead cranes are fixed cranes generally installed in factories at roof heights. Crawler cranes are mobile cranes fitted with tracks for increased load-handling capability and improved stability on poor ground conditions.<br>
Truck mounted cranes are fixed cranes mounted on truck chassis and are generally used for stacking of load on truck and moving long distances. Self-propelled mobile cranes are mobile self-propelled wheel mounted cranes capable of movement on the site as well as for intra-site movement.<br>
Among the self propelled mobile cranes, there are 360 degree slew rough terrain cranes, 360 degrees slew all terrain cranes, 360 degrees slew truck mounted mobile cranes, non-slew self propelled articulated cranes etc. 360 degree slew rough terrain cranes are capable of negotiating steeper slopes, have excellent rough terrain capability, medium speed upto 40 kmph and the boom can be rotated through full 360 degrees for positioning of loads. 360 degress slew all terrain cranes have limited rough terrain ability, high speed of the order of 80-90kmph, high maneuverability and multi-axles suitable for high way travel. 360 degree slew truck mounted mobile crane are mounted on truck chassis, have<br>
limited terrain capability, high speed of the order of 80-90 kmph, boom can be rotated through 360 degrees and are suitable for high way travel.<br>
Non-slew self propelled articulated cranes are provided with a diesel engine of 50-100 HP connected to a gear box through a single plate heavy duty friction type clutch. The output of the gearbox is given to a rear drive axle. The steering of vehicle is through articulation of front and rear bodies which is hydraulically controlled through two double acting cylinders. The front body is provided with a two-part box type boom for handling the load. The inner boom section is extended hydraulically for increasing reach and height. The boom end is provided with a snatch block, fitted with a hook for lifting/lowering load which is accomplished with a hydraulic motor. All load handling functions are generally hydraulic. The hydraulic system consists of an engine driven pump with control valve for operation of various functions.<br>
A disadvantage of the above-mentioned non-slew self-propelled crane is that it has to be moved for placement of load.<br>
Another disadvantage of the above mentioned crane is that it has a low speed.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the above-mentioned crane is that its boom has limited reach and height.<br>
Further disadvantage of the above crane is that it cannot be used for dragging etc. OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a non-slew self propelled articulated crane as a recovery crane capable of lifting and dragging wreckages of accidental vehicles including trucks and buses on highways, upto the weight of 10 tonnes and upto the size of 12m long.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a crane, which is capable of plying on highways at a cruising speed upto 40 kmph.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide a crane wherein the driver should be able to position himself in such a way that wreckage should be in front during clearing but should not be in front of the driver during towing and he should face the direction of movement during towing.<br>
Further object of this invention is to provide a crane which has ergonomically located controls and property designed operator cabin with all around visibility-Yet further object of this invention is to provide a crane which is cost effective.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a crane which is provided with outriggers for adequate stability.<br>
