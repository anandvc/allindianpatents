				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an automated thread rolling machine for eliminating<br>
Rolling/working of undersize, low hardened/high hardened components. The present invention also relates to a method for eliminating rolling/working of undersize, low hardened/high hardened components.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Circular thread Rolling Machines are used to form threads on fasteners and other<br>
Threaded components, profiles such as spine etc. with close accuracy and geometrical tolerances. Circular Thread Rolling Machines are used for rolling of threads using two rotating rollers and a work rest blade having desired thread profile. The two rotating rolls and work rest blade provide a three-point support for the blanks that are to be rolled and fix the geometric center for the system. This is called centreless operation for producing accurate thread profiles with close geometric accuracy of the rolled parts. The accuracy of products produced depends on a number of factors like machine condition, part condition, tool condition etc.<br>
A paired rolls having multi start thread profile are assembled on two shafts of the machine, either one of the rolls will be fixed and other one will be moving or both the rollers are moving in opposite direction. The work rest blade is positioned in such a way that when a part is fed on to the blade, the center of the part will be same as roll center after rolling. The rolls are driven by electric motor and will be rotating at the same speed. The rolls will apply pressure through hydraulic power pack.<br>
The operation sequence is as follows:<br>
-	rolls are assembled and checked for matching;<br>
-	work rest blade center is checked for correct height;<br>
-	roll motor is switched on and the rolls start rotating in desired direction;<br>
-	hydraulic motor is switched ON;<br>
-	parts are manually fed on to the work rest blade;<br>
-	tip of the part is stopped against a positive stopper to ensure constant threaded length;<br>
-	when Cycle start button is pressed, moving rolls will advance with fast approach and at a preset position will change over to slow speed and high pressure, the rolling of<br><br>
parts are completed and the rolls will reach set position, this is to ensure consistent thread dimensions.<br>
-	rolls will return to home position and ready to start next cycle; and<br>
-	part is unloaded manually on to the collection bin.<br>
Presently, the auto manufacturers are introducing automated assembly lines. Parts are directly fed into the assembly line without any incoming inspection and human involvement. Hence, the parts have to be defect free and have consistent quality. Any mixing of similar parts entering into the automated assembly line may cause stoppage of line. Customers insist on defect free supplies that can be directly fed to assembly line without any incoming inspection also, maintaining just in time inventory, no scope for rejection and segregation. This necessitates the supplies to have a robust system at manufacturing station to have defect free products. The final quality inspection by way of sorting is a time consuming process and also it does not provide the guarantee of 100% defect free supply as expected by the customer. Hence there is a long felt need for developing a system which removes the necessity of inspection and produces defect free products and 100% confirmation to specification of the products.<br>
All systems used for detecting bad parts in manufacturing process used either a force sensor or only a distance sensor. This invention uses the force and distance sensor in conjunction and develops a relation between distance and force based on which the product evaluation and subsequent rejections are done. Force-distance relationship also enables tool to be withdrawn on overload and therefore preventing damage to tools, machine etc. This system uses a combination of force and distance to segregate parts in manufacture to ensure zero defect and can be used on any manufacturing operation where a co-relation exists between distance and force.<br>

Further embodiment of the present invention, a method wherein the combination of force and distance is used to segregate parts in manufacture to ensure zero defects.<br>
The invention is further explained in the form of following embodiments:<br>
Force amplifier: Force amplifier gives 0- 10 V output corresponding to the millivolt<br>
from the sensor. There are 3 stages of amplification available namely Low , Medium ,<br><br>
and High. If the output signal in Low mode is X then in medium it will be 10 X and in high it will be 100 X. This amplification can be used depends on signal strength from force sensor.<br>
Work rest blade: Normally the work rest blade is set based on final size of the component after rolling. For example, if MIO thread to be formed on a blank, then initial blank diameter will be less than lOmm.This means that the centre line of the component will be below the centre line of the roll. Once the thread is completely formed, then the blank diameter will become close to 10 mm and the centre line of the MIO size thread will be in line with roll centerline.<br>
Man Machine Interface: This interface is a display unit, where operator can enter control parameters for rolling say force and distance directly. This unit will display reference distance, force values during 10-sample mode, mean load etc. Operator can observe through these readings by scrolling and can enter and set higher and lower limit of the force for rolling operation. Hence MMI interfaces operator directly with the logic controller.<br>
Force and Displacement sensors: There are force and displacement sensors mounted on the machine at a specific locations. The force sensor will send mV output to the amplifier during rolling operation where this signal voltage will be amplified to a measurable input and send to the CPU, while the displacement sensor will send voltage input to the CPU where there is a distance - voltage correlation exists. These two sensors have been integrated and the concept of monitoring the operation based on the logic provided to the CPU.<br><br>

Referencing valve: The referencing solenoid valve (1) of hydraulic system is energized and the fluid will pass through pressure reducing valve (14) at set flow rate. The flow rate is set based on rolling feed rate. Normally rolling feed rate is set to 0.076mm/roll rev. There is a knob in the flow control valve to set the flow. When the moving roll touches the component, slide stops and distance moved from home to part touch point is registered in MMI.<br>
Hydraulic system: The hydraulic system of the present invention having the following components:<br>
(a)	single solenoid valve for referencing application (1);<br>
(b)	solenoid valve for slide forward reverse application (2);<br>
(c)	single solenoid valve for slide forward and reverse application (3);<br>
(d)	single solenoid valve for rapid feed application (4);<br>
(e)	single solenoid valve for slide return (5);<br>
(f)	high response pressure switch for rapid to feed application (6);<br>
(g)	single acting cylinder for slide actuation (7); (h) single solenoid for referencing (8);<br>
(i) low pressure high flow pump for rapid traverse (9);<br>
(j) high pressure low flow pump for feed (10);<br>
(k) low pressure relief valve (11);<br>
(1) high pressure relief valve for rolling operation (12);<br>
(m)pressure and temperature compensated flow control valve for feed regulation (13);<br>
and (n) pressure reducing valve for referencing (14); Single cycle operation of semi automatic mode:<br>
Roll start moving from home position at rapid feed. When the rolls touch the component the pressure develops and high-pressure low volume pump takes over the rolling operation. Complete rolling operation, slide reaches the forward position then returns to its home position at faster rate. Part ejects from the machine.<br>
This cycle will be used for 10-sample mode cycle in MMI. Once initial force setting is over, then machine will be switched over to MONITOR mode. Then selector will be put in Auto mode for continuous production.<br><br>
Matching of rolls: This is a very important procedure requiring great care and accuracy. The two dies are positioned, when rolling a standard screw thread, so that the crests of one die are exactly opposite the roots of the other at the point of rolling contact with the work piece. In order to establish this relationship a matching or roll-timing coupling has been provided whereby the drive shaft to the left-hand die spindle (fixed slide) is rotated independently of the moving slide die. This will position the dies in such a way that crest and root will be matched.<br>
The machine of the present invention can sense force variations due to defects and a laser sensor will scan the distance. This combination of the system with a central processing unit and MM! will ensure that parts delivered to accepted part will conform to specification and 100% defect free. Bad parts will get segregated providing scope for analysis and improvement.<br>
