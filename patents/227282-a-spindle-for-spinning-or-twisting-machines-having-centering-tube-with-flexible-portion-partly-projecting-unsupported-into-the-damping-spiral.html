				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A spindle for spinning or twisting machines<br>
The present invention relates to a spindle for spinning or twisting machines<br>
comprising a rotating spindle shaft which is supported in a spindle bearing<br>
housing by means of a neck bearing and a step bearing, the latter comprising<br>
a step bearing sleeve which is arranged in a centering tube, which is clamped<br>
in the area of the neck bearing in the spindle bearing housing and is<br>
supported radially movable in the area of the step bearing by means of a<br>
damping spiral on the spindle bearing housing, whereby the centering tube<br>
comprises a flexible area between the neck bearing and the step bearing due<br>
to a helix-shaped encircling recess, which flexible area projects unsupported<br>
partly into the damping spiral.<br>
A spindle of this type is prior art in the German published examined<br>
application 11 36 918. In this publication, a safety device preventing<br>
unintentional lifting off of the removable upper spindle part is involved. This<br>
publication shows in the relevant drawings a standard embodiment, without a<br>
detailed description, according to which a centering tube of the above<br>
mentioned type is provided, which centering tube comprises a flexible zone<br>
due to the presence of a helix-shaped encircling recess. Centering tubes of<br>
this type are usually supported along the entire length on the damping spiral,<br>
whereby the flexible zone lies outside of, that is, over the damping spiral. In<br>
the case of the above mentioned publication, an embodiment is shown,<br>
without any detailed description, in which the flexible area projects partly and<br>
unsupported into the damping spiral. An explanation for the embodiment,<br>
which deviates from the standard design, is not given in the publication.<br>
In the case of spindles of the above mentioned type, the trend is towards<br>
smaller diameters and shorter spindle shaft lengths. Thus higher operational<br>
speeds can be realized. Because of the encircling, helix-shaped recess,<br>
however, the centering tubes cannot keep pace to the same extent as the<br>
spindle shafts with regard to above mentioned trend towards smaller<br><br>
diameters. When the distance between the neck bearing and the<br>
step bearing is reduced because the spindle shaft becomes<br>
shorter, the centering tube with its flexible zone must<br>
inevitably project deeper into the damping spiral. The flexible<br>
area, however, should not be supported on the damping spiral, as<br>
otherwise the flexibility inside the flexible zone is lost.<br>
GB 636424 discloses an improved spindle bearing on spinning<br>
and twisting machines. Two or more concentric liquid layers are<br>
provided between the upper end (6) of the bearing bush (2), and<br>
an annular wall (8) on the bearing casing (1) in a combined<br>
bolster and footstep bearing fluid damping means. As shown, the<br>
bush 2 rests at 7 on the casing 1 and an oil reservoir V its<br>
formed between the hearing portion 6 and the casing wall 8. A<br>
cylinder 10 is located with radial clearances between the parts<br>
6, 8. In operation oil collecting in the radial clearance spaces<br>
between the parts 6, 8, 10 acts to damp lateral vibrations of the<br>
spindle. Additional sleeves 16 may be used or the sleeve 10 may<br>
be replaced by a band or spring of spiral form.<br><br>
GB 1020148 discloses an improved mounting insert for<br>
carrying a spinning &amp;c. spindle* which comprises a casing 1<br>
carrying a roller &amp;c. bearing 2 and press-fitted into a bolster,<br>
a spring-sleeve 3 press—fitted into the casing, an inner tube 4,<br>
the upper end of which is held in place by and within the sleeve,<br>
carrying a foot—step bearing for the foot of the spindle, and<br>
damping—means for the tube located between the lower end of the<br>
holder and the tube. The casing 1 is tapered at its lower end for<br>
fitting into the holder, the sleeve is held by thickened portions,<br>
a, b of the casing wall; the tube 4 is held by a thickened<br>
portion d of the sleeve—wall and by having its top splayed out at<br>
and the footstep is held by dimples i and a ring 10 The<br>
seeve 3 is hardened and has separate helical &amp;c. grooves<br>
S,S<sp>1; the damping-means comprises concentric sleeves or<br>
a unitary spiral sleeve. The damping-means and the lower part of<br>
the footstep are immersed in oil which reaches the spindle at h<br>
and g, and is carried up to be thrown off centrifugally into a<br>
space c between the sleeve and the spindle and returns via the<br>
grooves S, S<sp>1</sp>. The space c prevents oil climbing beyond<br>
the bearing.<br><br>
GB 1015447 describes improvements in or relating to spindle<br>
mountings. According to the invention, a roller bearing 7 of a<br>
spinning &amp;c spindle mounting is resiliently mounted in an axial<br>
direction by means of a rubber or like washer 6 which is bonded<br>
to a surface 15 of collar 3a screwably attached to a portion 3d<br>
of a foot-step bearing housing 3, the washer also being bonded to<br>
the downwardly-facing surface of neck bearing housing 3b which<br>
carries the roller bearing 7, the outer circumference of the<br>
washer being unsupported. The housing 3 is externally-threaded so<br>
as to be attached by means of a nut 4 and collar 5, to a rail 1<br>
and carries a shell 10 which, having a groove therein, is<br>
attached to the housing 3 by means of a ring 11, the shell<br>
extending downwardly in the housing 3 to support a footstep-<br>
bearing (not shown). In modifications, the collar 5 may be<br>
integral with the housing 3; the washer 6 may be bonded to a<br>
flange forward on the housing 3 and an extension of the housing<br>
3b; the shell 10 may be carried by a flange which engages a<br>
shoulder of the housing 3b, and a foot-step hearing may be<br>
connected to the housing 3 by a rubger washer bonded thereto, a<br>
damping-spiral being provided to damp the foot-step bearing or<br>
the shell 10.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to design a spindle<br>
of the above mentioned type specially for a spindle shaft, which<br>
is smaller in diameter and shorter in its length than the present<br>
standard spindle shafts, and which has, in particular, a diameter<br>
at the neck bearing of less than 6.B mm, which is the present<br>
standard dimension.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the present<br>
invention in that the unsupported part of the flexible zone which<br>
projects into the damping spiral amounts to more than half of the<br>
flexible zone.<br>
According to the present invention, the spindle mentioned<br>
above and most likely shown by chance in prior art is now<br>
provided with a rule of calculation, which is not discussed in<br>
the above mentioned publication. In particular when the section<br>
projecting unsupported into the damping spiral amounts to<br>
approximately two thirds of the flexible area, a spindle arises<br>
in which the centering tube is supported on the damping spiral<br>
only in the area of the step bearing. It has been shown that this<br>
is sufficient. The flexural strength of the centering tube is not<br>
impaired by the damping spiral. Deviating from the present<br><br>
standard, it is now provided that the centering tube is supported<br>
only along approximately a third of the length of the damping<br>
spiral.<br>
These and further objects, features and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become more readily apparent from the<br>
following detailed description of an embodiment.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The spindle 1 according to the present invention, arranged<br>
vertically and designed as a ring spindle, comprises a spindle<br>
shaft 2 driven to rotate, said	...<br><br>
spindle shaft 2 being supported in a neck bearing 3 in the form of a roller<br>
bearing and in a two-part step bearing 4. The neck bearing 3 and the step<br>
bearing 4 are located in a multi-part spindle bearing housing 5.<br>
The spindle bearing housing 5 comprises essentially a two-part sleeve 7,8<br>
having a bottom 6 as well as a bearing head 9 which takes up the neck<br>
bearing 3, said bearing head 9 being inserted from above into the sleeve 7,8<br>
by means of a press fit 10. In the inside of the spindle bearing housing 5, an<br>
oil bath is located in the area of the step bearing 4.<br>
The step bearing 4 comprises a step bearing sleeve 11 which takes up the<br>
radial forces, as well as a thrust plate 12 which takes up the axial forces. The<br>
step bearing sleeve 11 is attached to a centering tube 13, which in turn is<br>
clamped by means of a press fit 14 in the bearing head 9. The centering tube<br>
13 comprises a helix-shaped recess 15, which makes the centering tube 13<br>
flexible to a desired degree, so that it is radially movable in the area of the<br>
step bearing 4.<br>
An annular gap is located between the cylindrical inner contour of the sleeve<br>
7,8 and the cylindrical outer contour of the centering tube 13, which annular<br>
gap takes up a damping spiral 16 in the known way. The damping spiral 16 is<br>
arranged entirely in the oil bath. By means of cross holes 17,18 in the<br>
centering tube 13, the annular space containing the damping spiral 16 is<br>
connected with the oil bath of the step bearing 4. The centering tube 13 is<br>
supported over the damping spiral 16 on the spindle bearing housing 5. The<br>
damping spiral 16 is supported upwards via a spacing ring 19.<br>
The spindle 1 is affixed in the known way together with a plurality of other,<br>
adjacently arranged spindles in a spindle bank 20 (denoted only by a dot-dash<br>
line). A drive wharve (not shown) is further arranged to the spindle 1,<br>
whereby all drive wharves can be driven by a continuous drive belt extending<br>
in machine longitudinal direction.<br><br>
The present invention is concerned in particular with a spindle 1, whose<br>
spindle shaft 2 has a smaller diameter in the area of the neck bearing 3 than<br>
is presently the standard, that is, a diameter measuring less than 6.8 mm.<br>
Because the flexural strength of the spindle shaft 2 should not, for dynamical<br>
reasons, be lessened when the neck bearing diameter is reduced, the<br>
distance between the neck bearing 3 and the step bearing 4 must become<br>
smaller. The centering tube 13, into which a 360°, helix-shaped recess 15 is<br>
milled in order that the centering tube 13 comprises a correspondingly soft<br>
flexible zone B, therefore projects up to the area of the damping spiral 16. In<br>
order that the effect of flexible zone B is not impaired, the centering tube 13<br>
should not be supported hereby in the area of the flexible zone B on the<br>
damping spiral 16. It is therefore provided that the flexible zone B projects<br>
with a section T in the damping spiral 16. According to the present invention,<br>
this section T measures more than half of the flexible zone B. The section T<br>
which projects unsupported into the damping spiral 16 preferably measures<br>
approximately two thirds of the flexible zone B.<br>
It has been shown that it is sufficient when the centering tube 13 is supported<br>
on approximately only one third of the length L of the damping spiral 16. The<br>
centering tube 13 is supported essentially only in the area of the step bearing<br>
4 on the damping spiral 16 and is thereabove and therebelow unsupported to<br>
a great extent. Despite the reduced length of the spindle shaft 2, the flexural<br>
strength of the centering tube 13 is not impaired.<br><br>
