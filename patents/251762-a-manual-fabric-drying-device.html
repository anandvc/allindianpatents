				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a manual fabric drying device. More particularly, the invention relates to a fabric drying device operated manually for squeezing and drying of different kind of fabrics.<br>
The object of the invention is to squeeze and carry out fast drying of different fabrics avoiding squeezing and twisting the fabric manually.<br>
Generally at home, after hand washing fabric is squeezed by hand twisting and thus torsional force is applied, it may produce excess crease, loss of stretchability, abnormal extension and deformation in fabric. Some delicates fabrics like woollens, knitted and special weave fabric requires soft gentle squeezing after washing to remove excess water i.e.. for dewatering and fast drying. These fabrics if twisted by hand or by conventionally used washing machines have deformation of fabrics and are generally out of use due to abnormal extensions thus losing their original configuration. However, if excess water is removed by a method where no twisting force is applied and water is removed only due to effect of centrifugal force by rotating the fabrics the above mentioned problems can be overcome.<br>
Conventionally a squeezer or drier is provided along with the washer itself in the washing machines which is operated by electricity and is very costly. Also drying the fabrics in such dryers results in abnormal extensions in the fabrics and long use of such dryers leads to fast wearing off of the fabrics. There always existed a need for a drier which is cost effective and avoids the existing drawbacks.<br>
In the present invention a fabric drying device has been made for fast drying and squeezing of different fabrics by use of the centrifugal force and building up the air pressure in the drying device for increasing the rate of evaporation so as to result in fast drying of fabric without causing any deformation or abnormal extensions during the process. The fabric drying device is cost effective, handy and not dependent on the power supply. It is useful in the places where there is scarcity of electricity specially in the remote and rural areas.<br>
In order to achieve the above disclosed objective the fabrics are kept in the perforated enclosure. The fabric drying device is then operated by means of a handle. The speed of the perforated enclosure depends on the No. of gears used in the drying device and the teeth ratio. Due to the rotation of the spindle the fan blade also moves and sucks the air from top of the perforated enclosure. Thus the air circulates from top to bottom of the perforated enclosure which expedites the drying of the fabrics. In the subject invention drying and squeezing take place simultaneously. The rotation per minute of the fan blade and enclosure is the same. The top of the enclosure is not covered during drying and squeezing.<br>
The dryer in short comprises the following essential components:<br>
(1)	One central spindle;<br>
(2)	Plastic fan blades.<br>
(3)	Bush, bearings;<br>
(4)	Oil seal<br>
(5)	Gears with different teeth No.;<br>
(6)	Perforated enclosure with lid;<br>
(7)	Outer casing<br>
(8)	Handle for rotating the gear;<br>
(9)	Outer frame and base.<br>
The device is completely manual hand driven. Gears are provided for giving rotational speed to enclosure. The teeth ratio between small gear penion and main gear may be kept 1:10 so if main gear moves with a speed of 20 r.p.m. than small gear penion will move with a speed of 200 r.p.m. But speed of perforated enclosure is depended, how fast the main gear is rotated by hand. However by using four gear setting r.p.m. of the enclosure can be increased upto 250-300. The gear is made of steel or any other metallic material whose life span will be longer. The outer supporting frame is made of non corrosion type of material e.g. stainless steel or any other material. The base of the apparatus should be heavy, so that no vibration takes place during rotation. There is requirement of stainless steel main shaft upon which enclosureis fastened.   To avoid the leakage of water from enclosureto bearings and<br>
gear, oil seal is used and also the outer cover of the enclosureis such of shape that whatever water will come out from the perforation of cage, will be collected in outer cover, therefore no draining inside apparatus will occur. Loading capacity of apparatus is depend on size of enclosureand gears. The draining of water is done by using a single pipe attached to hole in outer cover of the cage.<br>
The same apparatus can be used of a washer if instead of using perforated cage, we use solid container. Since gears are free to rotate in clock wise and anticlock wise direction, so fabric container can move in both direction. For fast and easy removal of dirt, dust and other attached oil/print, it is essential to rotate the fabric in both clockwise and anticlock wise direction alternatively and due to inertia effect dirt and dust particles will be detached.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a manual fabric drying device comprising a perforated container rotatably mounted on a spindle provided with bush bearings near the top end of the spindle, means for rotating the spindle in clock wise as well as anti clock wise direction, means for enhancing the speed of rotation of the spindle, a fan blade attached to the spindle below the bush bearing of the perforated container, for increasing air passage through the perforated container building up the air pressure, rate of evaporation thus enhancing squeezing and drying the fabrics, wherein the base of the perforated container is heavier than its side walls, and an container with an outlet pipe is provided around the perforated container for out flow of the squeezed/drudged water as liquid.<br>
The another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the said means for rotating the spindle, is as a gear arrangement comprising a pair of small gear and a pair of big gear having the teeth ratio between the small gear position and main gear position around 1:8 to 1:15, operated by a handle attached to the main gear.<br>
The another embodiment of the present invention wherein the said means for enhancing the speed of rotation of the spindle comprises a pair of main gear having the teeth ratio between the first and second gear is 1:2 to 1:10 attached to a pair of<br>
small gear having the teeth ratio  1:2 to  1:10 imparting enhanced speed to the perforated container 10 to 15 times than the original applied speed.<br>
The another embodiment of the present invention wherein said perforated container is provided in another container having an outlet pipe at the bottom end for drying of the water.<br>
Further embodiment of the present invention wherein an air seal bearing bush, for ratably fixing the perforated container to the spindle.<br>
The invention is described with respect to the accompanying drawing which should not be construed as limitation of the invention and the drawing is meant for illustrative purposes only.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 depicts the diagram of complete section of the squeezer<br>
As shown in the figure 1 a perforated enclosure (5) is ratably mounted on the main spindle (8) above the bush bearings (12). The perforated enclosure (5) is covered with the outer casing (6). Gears (1, 2, 3, 4) are provided for giving rotational speed to enclosure. The teeth ratio between small gear pinions (2), 4) and main gear is maintained in the ratio of 1:10. But speed of perforated enclosure (5) depends, how fast the main gear (1) is being rotated. The fabric drying device is cost effective in which the teeth ratio is kept 1:4 to 1:6 and a speed of 80-100 or 120-140 rotation per minute is achieved. However by using four gear setting r.p.m. of the enclosure can be increased upto 250-300. The gears (1, 2, 3, 4) are made of steel whose service life will be longer. The outer supporting frame (11) is made of non corrosion type of material e.g. stainless steel or any other material. The base of the fabric drying device is made heavy, so that no vibration takes place during rotation. There is requirement of stainless steel main spindle (8) upon which enclosure (5) is fastened. A fan blade made of plastic or any other suitable material (7) is attached to the main spindle (8)<br>
just below the bush bearing (12) of the perforated enclosure (5). The avoid the leakage of water from enclosure to bearings and gear, oil seal (9) is used and also the outer cover (6) of the enclosure is such of shape that whatever water will come out from the perforation of enclosure, will be collected in outer cover, therefore no draining inside fabric drying device will occur. Loading capacity of fabric drying device is depends on size of enclosure and gears. The draining of water is done by using a single pipe (10) attached to hole in outer cover of the enclosure.<br>
The same fabric drying device can be used of a washer if instead of using perforated enclosure, we use solid container. Since gears are free to rotate in clock wise and anti clock wise direction, so enclosure can move in both direction. For fast and easy removal of dirt, dust and other attached oil, it is essential to rotate the fabric in both clock wise and anti clockwise direction alternatively and due to inertia effect dirt and dust particles will be detached.<br>
The subject invention is a mere statement of invention where many alterations and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The subject disclosure is for illustrative purposes only and hence should not be construed to limit the scope of this invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
