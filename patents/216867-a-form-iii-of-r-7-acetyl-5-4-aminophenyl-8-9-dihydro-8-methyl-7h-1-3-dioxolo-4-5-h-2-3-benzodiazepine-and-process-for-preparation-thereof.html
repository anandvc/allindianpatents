				<td>Field of Invention:<br>
This inventions relates to a novel physical form of<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl) -8, 9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,<br>
3-dioxolo [4, 5-h] [2, 3]-benzodiazepine derivative useful<br>
as a Pharmaceuticals in the treatment of disorders of the<br>
nervous system.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
European patent application publication number EP-<br>
Al-0492485 discloses the compound 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-acetyl-<br>
4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2 , 3-<br>
benzodiazepine. The compound is a potent and selective<br>
antagonist of the excitatory amino acid AMPA receptor and is<br>
believed to have the ability to treat a variety of<br>
neurological disorders. The (R)enantiomer of this compound,<br>
hereinafter referred to as (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-<br>
8, 9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-<br>
h][2,3]benzodiazepine, is the most potent enantiomer.<br>
The present invention provides a physical form of<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-<br>
dioxolo[4,5-h] [2, 3]benzodiazepine having an X-ray powder<br>
diffraction pattern with d spacings at 10.61, 8.83, 6.78,<br>
5.83, 4.13 and 3.74 A. It also provides a process for<br>
producing this form, pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
it and methods of using it.<br>
It has been found that (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-<br>
8, 9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine<br>
is polymorphic.<br>
The first physical form of (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-amino-<br>
phenyl)-8, 9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4, 5- <br>
h] [2, 3 ] benzodiazepine to be found had a melting point of<br>
about 168-172*C and an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with<br>
characteristic d spacings at 6.57 and 5.24 A. This physical<br>
form is referred to hereinafter as form I. It has been<br>
prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-<br>
nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]-benzodiazepine in<br>
ethanol using hydrogen and palladium on carbon as catalyst,<br>
then removing the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the<br>
ethanol, heating the residue in 5.7 volumes of 1:1<br>
water/ethanol under reflux and then allowing the resultant<br>
solution to cool.<br>
Surprisingly, modifying the process used to prepare form<br>
I by using ammonium formate and palladium on carbon instead<br>
of hydrogen and palladium on carbon gave a new physical form<br>
of (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-<br>
1,3-dioxolo [4,5-h][2,3] benzodiazepine, hereafter referred to<br>
as form II. Thus form II has been prepared by reducing (R)-<br>
7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-<br>
dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine in ethanol using ammonium<br>
formate and palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing<br>
the catalyst by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol,<br>
heating the residue in 6 volumes of 1:1 water/ethanol under<br>
reflux, and allowing the resultant solution to cool. Form II<br>
has been found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern<br>
with characteristic d spacings at 13.12 and 5.01 A.<br>
Modifying the process used to prepare form II by using<br>
potassium f ormate_and_.,palladium on ...carbon instead of ammonium<br>
formate and palladium on carbon surprisingly gave yet another<br>
physical form, referred to hereinafter as form III. Thus<br>
form III has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-<br>
dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-<br>
h][2,3]benzodiazepine in ethanol using potassium formate and<br>
palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst<br>
by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol, heating the<br>
residue in 6 volumes of 1:1 water/ethanol under reflux and<br>
allowing the resultant solution to cool. Form III has been<br>
found to have an X-ray powder diffraction pattern with<br>
characteristic d spacings at 10.61, 8.83, 6.78, 5.83, 4.13<br>
and 3.74 A. This physical form is provided as one aspect of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Surprisingly, yet another physical form, hereinafter<br>
referred to as form IV has also been found. This form was<br>
initially observed to have been formed after form II had been<br>
heated. It was subsequently found that form IV may be<br>
prepared directly by modifying the process used to prepare<br>
form III, in particular by increasing the volume ratio of<br>
-water/ethanol used in the crystallization step. Thus form IV<br>
has been prepared by reducing (R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-<br>
methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h] [2,3] -<br>
benzodiazepine in ethanol using potassium formate and<br>
palladium on carbon as catalyst, then removing the catalyst<br>
by filtration, evaporating off the ethanol, heating the<br>
residue in 8 volumes of 5:3 water/ethanol or 7 volumes of 4:3<br>
water/ethanol under reflux, optionally seeding with Form IV<br>
crystals at 70-80" and allowing the resultant mixture to<br>
cool. Form IV has been found to have an X-ray powder<br>
diffraction pattern with characterization d spacings at<br>
12.78, 9.48, 8.99, 8.64, 8.23, 6.39, 6.27, 5.73, 4.01 and<br>
3.96 A. This physical form is the subject of a co-pending<br>
patent application (ref. X-9386D).<br>
Form I has been found to possess several<br>
disadvantageous properties. In particular, it has been found<br>
to crystallize out as a thick slurry which is difficult to<br>
stir and transfer. The filtration time has been found to be<br>
unacceptably long for large scale production, and the drying<br>
time for filtered wet cake is also long. Furthermore, Form I<br>
has been found to be thermally unstable and has been found to<br>
convert to form IV or, occassionally, yet another physical<br>
form, hereineafter referred to as form V. Form V has been<br>
found to have a X-ray powder diffraction pattern with<br>
characterization d spacings at 6.12, 5.94 and 5.48 A. Form V<br>
shows multiple phase transitions when subject to differential<br>
scanning calorimetry.<br>
Form II has been found to crystallize out as a<br>
stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered. However,<br>
it has been found to dry slowly and to retain crystallization<br>
solvent. Like Form I, it has been found to be thermally<br>
unstable with regard to conversion to form IV.<br>
Form III has been found to crystallize out as a<br>
stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered and dried.<br>
It has also been found to be thermally stable.<br>
Form IV has also been found to crystallize out as a<br>
-stirrable suspension which can readily be filtered and dried.<br>
Like Form III, it has also been found to be thermally stable.<br>
Each of Forms I, II, III, IV and V has been<br>
characterized by a X-ray diffraction, by 13C solid state NMR<br>
spectroscopy and by differential scanning calorimetry. The<br>
techniques used, and the physical characteristics determined<br>
for samples of each form are given below, together (for form<br>
III and IV only) with general ranges obtained by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry using a number of different samples.<br>
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a<br>
Siemens D5000 X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a Cu Ka<br>
(l,= l. 54056A) source operating at a tube load of 50KV and<br>
40mA. Data was collected with a Kevex solid-state detector.<br>
Each sample was scanned between 4 and 35" 20 with a step size<br>
of 0.03° and a maximum scan rate of 2 sec/step.<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)<br>
measurements were performed on a Seiko differential scanning<br>
calorimeter. Samples (2-5mg) sealed in aluminum pans were<br>
heated from ambient (25"O to at least 200"C at a rate of<br>
10"C/min.<br>
13C Cross polarization/magic angle spinning<br>
(CP/MAS) NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Unity 400<br>
MHz spectrometer operating at a carbon frequency of 100.577<br>
MHZ and equipped with a complete solids accessory and Varian<br>
5 or 7 mm VT CP/MAS probe. Typical measurement conditions<br>
were as follows: 90(deg) proton r.f. pulse 5.0 ms, contact<br>
time 1-2 ms, pulse repetition time 5s, MAS frequency 7 kHz,<br>
spectral width 50 kHz, and acquisition time 50 ms. The<br>
chemical shifts were referenced to the CH3 group of<br>
hexamethylbenzene (delta = 17.3 ppm) by sample replacement.<br>
Form III<br>
DSC: Endotherm at 194.7 °C for this sample. Other samples<br>
have been found to show an endotherm at a temperature in the<br>
range of from 192 to 195"C.<br>
Form IV<br>
DSC: Endotherm at 2 03.2 °C for this sample. Other samples<br>
have been found to show an endotherm at a temperature in the<br>
range of from 201 to 207oC.<br>
in which Ms is methanesulfonyl, R is methyl, X is acetyl and<br>
Aryl is p-nitrophenyl, with caustic soda to afford a compound<br>
of formula I<br>
in which R is methyl, X is acetyl and Aryl is p-nitrophenyl;<br>
b) reducing the p-nitrophenyl group in the formula<br>
I compound to an aniline group using potassium formate in the<br>
presence of palladium or charcoal as catalyst to afford a<br>
compound of formula I in which Aryl is p-aminophenyl; and<br>
c) crystallizing the compound of formula I in which<br>
Aryl is p-aminophenyl from a mixture of water and ethanol in<br>
which the number of volumes of water per volume of ethanol is<br>
less than 1.1 to 1.0.<br>
It may be possible to use a higher volume ratio of<br>
water to ethanol in step (c) if a seed of form III is used.<br>
Step (a) of the process is conveniently performed at a<br>
temperature in the range of from 0 to 100"C. Suitable<br>
solvents include alkanols such as methanol or ethanol, and<br>
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The compound of general formula VII may be prepared by<br>
a multistep process, starting from a methylenedioxyphenyl<br>
ketone derivative. This process comprises:<br>
a) providing a quantity of a compound having the<br>
formula:<br>
in which R is methyl;<br>
b) asymmetrically reducing the compound of<br>
formula II to yield a compound having the formula:<br>
c) reacting the compound of formula III with p-<br>
nitrobenzaldehyde to yield an isochroman compound having the<br>
formula:<br>
d) reacting the compound of formula IV with an<br>
oxidizing agent to yield a compound of the formula:<br>
e) reacting the compound of formula V with acetic<br>
hydrazide to yield a compound of the formula:<br>
f) reacting the compound of formula VI with<br>
methanesulfonyl chloride and a tertiary amine, to form a<br>
compound of formula VII.<br>
The preferred process involves the early chiral<br>
reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. Substituents are added<br>
in a multi-step process to close the benzo-fused pyran ring,<br>
before a hydrazine reagent is introduced to open the ring and<br>
add the necessary nitrogen components. Finally, the<br>
secondary ring is closed by addition of a strong base and the<br>
compound is reduced to form the desired compound.<br>
Most preferably, the chiral reduction step is the<br>
initial step in the synthesis of the Formula (I) compounds<br>
from ketones. The chiral reduction may be effected by use of<br>
specific chemicals or, preferably, by using biological agents<br>
as disclosed below. Setting the stereochemistry early in the<br>
process is beneficial and allows for the later steps to be<br>
carried out on relatively enantiomerically pure material.<br>
This increases both throughput and enantiomeric purity.<br>
The first step of the process involves a chiral<br>
reduction of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl acetone to produce a<br>
virtually enantiomerically pure alcohol derivative of 1,2-<br>
methylenedioxybenzene. Preferably, the enantiomer formed is<br>
the S or (+) stereoisomer of the alcohol.<br>
Alternatively, the initial step may involve the<br>
combination of a halo derivative of 1,2-methylenedioxybenzene<br>
with an enantiomerically enriched epoxide. This also results<br>
in the production of a highly enantiomerically enriched<br>
alcohol derivative of 1,2 methylenedioxybenzene.<br>
The material used to effect the chiral reduction<br>
initial step may be either chemical or preferably biological.<br>
In the case of biological agents, the preferred agents are<br>
reducing enzymes, most preferred being yeasts from the<br>
Zygosaccharomyces group. Other biological agents which may<br>
be used include: Pichia fermentans, Endomycopsis fibuligera,<br>
Nematospora coryli, Saccharomyces sp., Candida famata,<br>
Saccharomyces pastorianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,<br>
Saccharomyces uvarum, Candida utilis, Saccharomyces globosus,<br>
Kluyveromyces dobzhansk, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida<br>
albicans, bakers" yeast, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii,<br>
Lactobacillus acidophilus, Aureobasidium pullulans,<br>
Mortierella isabellina, Rhizopus oryzae, Kloeckeva javanica,<br>
Hanseniaspora valbyensis, Octosporomyces octospori, Candida<br>
guiiliermondi, Candida parapsilosis, Candida tropicalis,<br>
Torulopsis taboadae, Torulopsis ethanolitolerans, Torulopsis<br>
ptarmiganii, Torulopsis sonorensis, Trigonopsis variabilis,<br>
Torulopsis enokii, Torulopsis methanothermo, SAF instant<br>
yeast, ashland yeast inact., Candida boidinii, Candida<br>
blankii and Red Star yeast.<br>
The desired intermediate formed in the initial step<br>
is an alcohol substituted congener of 1,2-<br>
methylenedioxybenzene, with the most preferred congener<br>
consisting of (S)-a-Methyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-ethanol.<br>
The desired intermediate compound formed in the<br>
initial step is then subjected to a Pictet-Spengler reaction<br>
which provides for convergent fusion of the benzodiazepine<br>
carbon constituents. The preferred reagent of choice is p-<br>
nitrobenzaldehyde, although other reagents known to those<br>
skilled in the art, such as acetals, may be used. The<br>
preferred intermediates are dihydrobenzopyrans with the most<br>
preferred compound being 7,8-dihydro-7-methyl-5-(4-<br>
nitrophenyl)-5H-1,3-dioxolo-benzo[b]pyran.<br>
The dihydrobenzopyran congener is then oxidized at<br>
the C5 position to yield a hemiketal derivative of the<br>
general formula<br>
The preferred oxidizing agents include potassium<br>
permanganate, DDQ (2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-l,4-benzoquinone)<br>
or others, with the most preferred agent being a sodium<br>
hydroxide and air combination.<br>
The C5-hemiketal is then reacted with acetic<br>
hydrazide in the presence of acid in order to form the<br>
hydrazone intermediate. In this step, the benzopyran ring is<br>
opened such that the hydrazone component is attached to the<br>
C5 carbon. The reaction is conveniently performed in a<br>
refluxing aromatic or protic solvent, with the hydrazone<br>
being of the general formula<br>
wherein R is CH3, X is acetyl and Aryl is p-nitrophenyl.<br>
The process can be summarized by the following<br>
schemes.<br>
In scheme (I), the initial step of the process<br>
involves the addition of biological agents, most preferably<br>
Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, to reduce the ketone to the desired<br>
alcohol. A suitable quantity of an adsorbent resin such as<br>
AD-7, XAD-7, HP2MGL (cross-linked polymethacrylates from Rohm<br>
&amp; Haas), HP20 (polystyrenic), or SP207 (brominated<br>
polystyrene from Mitsubishi) may be added to the reaction<br>
mixture to prevent death of the organism and to adsorb the<br>
In scheme (II), the initial step of the process<br>
involves reacting an aryl halide derivative, such as 4-bromo-<br>
1,2-(methylenedioxy) benzene, with an alkali metal<br>
hydrocarbon (sec-butyllithium is preferred) and an<br>
enantiomerically pure epoxide. Alternatively, an aryl halide<br>
may first be converted into a Grignard reagent by reaction<br>
with magnesium, then reacted with an enantiomerically pure<br>
epoxide in the presence of copper (I) oxide as catalyst.<br>
Preferred is (S) - (-)-propylene oxide. In both scheme (I)<br>
and scheme (II), the objective is to set the stereochemistry<br>
of the C8 atom of the benzodiazepine ring as early as<br>
possible. Both schemes have been observed to accomplish this<br>
objective and have formed enantiomerically enriched (ee)<br>
alcohols in the 98% purity range.<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-<br>
1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine is known to be a<br>
selective antagonist for the AMPA receptor. According to yet<br>
another aspect, therefore, the present invention provides the<br>
use of form III for the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
blocking AMPA receptors in a mammal requiring such treatment.<br>
A variety of physiological functions have been shown to<br>
be subject to influence by excessive or inappropriate<br>
stimulation of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission. (R) -<br>
7-Acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-<br>
dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine is believed to have the<br>
ability to treat a variety of neurological disorders in<br>
mammals associated with this condition which include acute<br>
neurological disorders such as cerebral deficits subsequent<br>
to cardiac bypass surgery and grafting, stroke, cerebral<br>
ischemia, spinal cord trauma, head trauma, perinatal hypoxia,<br>
cardiac arrest and hypoglycemic neuronal damage. The<br>
compound is believed to have the ability to treat a variety<br>
of chronic neurological disorders such as Alzheimer"s<br>
Disease, Huntington"s Chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,<br>
AIDS-induced dementia, ocular damage and retinopathy, and<br>
idiopathic and drug-induced Parkinson"s Disease. The present<br>
invention also provides the use of form II for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for treating these disorders.<br>
The compound is also believed to have the ability<br>
to treat a variety of other neurological disorders in mammals<br>
that are associated with glutamate dysfunction including<br>
muscular spasms, convulsions, migraine headaches, urinary<br>
incontinence, psychosis, drug tolerance and withdrawal,<br>
anxiety, emesis, brain edema, chronic pain, and tardive<br>
dyskinesia. The compound is also useful as an analgesic<br>
agent. Therefore, the present invention also provides the<br>
use of form III for the manufacture of a medicament for<br>
treating these disorders.<br>
The term "effective amount" is used herein to<br>
represent an amount of form III which is capable of blocking<br>
the AMPA excitatory amino acid receptor. The particular dose<br>
of compound administered according to this invention will of<br>
course be determined by the particular circumstances<br>
surrounding the case, including the compound administered,<br>
the route of administration, the particular condition being<br>
treated, and similar considerations. The form can be<br>
administered by a variety of routes including the oral,<br>
rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, or intranasal routes. Alternatively, the form<br>
may be administered by continuous infusion. A typical daily<br>
dose will contain from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 30 mg/kg of<br>
the active compound of this invention. Preferred daily doses<br>
will be about 0.05 mg/kg to about 2 4 mg/kg, more preferably<br>
about 0.1 to about 20 mg/kg.<br>
Form III will generally be administered to patents<br>
in a pharmaceutical composition. According to another<br>
aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition, which comprises form III and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable diluent or carrier.<br>
In making the compositions of the present<br>
invention, the active ingredient will usually be mixed with a<br>
carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a<br>
carrier which may be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper,<br>
or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it<br>
may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material which acts as<br>
a vehicle, excipient, or medium for the active ingredient.<br>
The compositions can be in the form of, for example, tablets,<br>
pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, suspensions,<br>

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of (S)-a-methvl-1,3 benzodioxole-5-ethanol<br>
1 equiv. of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl acetone, 0.45<br>
equiv. disodium phosphate, 0.03 equiv. phosphoric acid, 12.5<br>
volumes AD-7 resin and 5.8 volumes of water were mixed<br>
together and stirred for 15-60 minutes at 20-25°C. 2.27<br>
equiv. of glucose were added and Z. rouxii ATCC 14462 is<br>
added in an amount of 1.5 grams wet cell paste per gram of<br>
ketone (this is 0.375 grams/gram on a dry basis). This<br>
mixture was diluted with water to 2 5 volumes and then gently<br>
stirred at 33-35°C for 8-16 hours. The mixture was filtered<br>
on a 100 mesh (-150 micron) stainless steel screen, and the<br>
resin which was retained by the screen was washed with 25<br>
volumes of water split into 4 separate portions. The<br>
product, which was adsorbed to the resin, was then desorbed<br>
from the resin with 25 volumes of acetone. The<br>
acetone/product solution was then stripped to dryness under<br>
vacuum to yield the title intermediate as a yellow, medium<br>
viscosity oil. The in-situ yield was 97-100%, while the<br>
isolated yield was 85-90%. The potency was 80-95% and the EE<br>
is 100%.<br>

volumes of toluene, filtered over hyflo, and washed with 1.55<br>
volumes of toluene. 1.05 equiv. p-nitro-benzaldehyde and<br>
1.05 equiv. of conc, hydrochloric acid were added, and the<br>
mixture was heated to 55-65°C and stirred 1 hour. A solvent<br>
exchange was then conducted at 2 50 mmHg, replacing the<br>
toluene with 12.4 volumes of 93% isopropanol/7% water/ The<br>
volume during this solvent exchange varies from 11-14<br>
volumes, and the final volume was ~ 11 volumes. The mixture<br>
was cooled to 0-10°C and stirred 1 hour. The needle-like<br>
product crystals were filtered and washed 2 times with 1.85<br>
vol. isopropanol and dried under vacuum at 50-60°C. The in-<br>
situ yield of the title compound was 95+% while the isolated<br>
yield was 87-93%. The potency was 99+% and the EE is 100%.<br>

to cool and the product precipitated near room temperature.<br>
The resulting thick, poorly stirring, slurry was stirred at<br>
room temperature and then cooled in an ice/water bath. The<br>
solid was isolated by filtration and dried in a vacuum oven<br>
at 55oC overnight to afford 31.6 g of purified product. A<br>
second recrystallization using the same conditions afforded<br>
28.7 g (80%) of product after drying under vacuum for 3 days<br>
at 65"C and 3 days at room temperature. The product dried<br>
very slowly and 1.6% ethanol was still on the sample at this<br>
point. Analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD), solid state NMR<br>
(SSNMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated<br>
that the Form I polymorph was formed.<br>
Example 2 0<br>
Synthesis of Form II of (R)-7-acetvl-5-(4-aminophenvl)-8.9-<br>
dihvdro-8-methvl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2.3]benzodiazepine<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-<br>
dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine (8.63 g) was hydrogenated<br>
in 170 mL (19 volumes) of 2B-3 ethanol using 0.86 g of 10%<br>
palladium on carbon and 4.59 g of ammonium carbonate in 5 mL<br>
of water as the hydrogen transfer source. When HPLC analysis<br>
indicated that starting material had been consumed, the<br>
catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate was<br>
evaporated to afford 8.19g of crude product. The crude<br>
product was dissolved in 50 mL (6.0 volumes) of 1:1<br>
water/ethanol by heating to reflux. The mixture was allowed<br>
to cool to room temperature and then cooled in an ice/water<br>
bath. The solid was isolated by filtration and dried in a<br>
vacuum oven at 60"C overnight to afford 7.41 g (93%) of<br>
purified product. The large crystals cointained 5.0% ethanol<br>
(GO and 4.2% water (KF). Analysis by XRD, SSNMR and DSC<br>
indicated that the Form II polymorph was formed.<br>
Example 21<br>
Synthesis of Form III of (R)-7-acetvl-5-(4-aminophenvl)-8,9-<br>
dihvdro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo F4,5-h][ [2,31benzodiazepine<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-1,3-<br>
dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine (2.04 g) was hydrogenated<br>
in 20 mL (10 volumes ) of 2B-3 ethanol using 0.20 g of 10%<br>
palladium on carbon and 1.47 g of potassium formate in 4 mL<br>
of water as the hydrogen transfer source. When HPLC analysis<br>
indicated that starting material had been consumed, the<br>
catalyst was removed by filtration and the filtrate was<br>
evaporated to afford 2.09 g of crude product. The crude<br>
product was dissolved in 12 mL (6.0 volumes) of 1:1<br>
water/ethanol by heating to reflux. The mixture was allowed<br>
to cool and was seeded with Form II crystals at about 40"C.<br>
After reaching room temperature, the mixture was cooled in an<br>
ice/water bath. The solid was isolated by filtration and<br>
dried in a vacuum oven at 50oC for 24 h to afford 1.45 g(77%)<br>
of purified product. Analysis showed 0.05% ethanol (GC) and<br>
0.75% water (KF). Despite using Form II polymorph seed<br>
crystals, analysis by XRD, SSNMR and DSC indicated that the<br>
Form III polymorph was formed.<br>
Example 22<br>
Synthesis of Form IV of (R)-7-acetvl-5-(4-aminophenvl)-8,9-<br>
dihvdro-8-methvl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine<br>
(R)-7-acetyl-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-5-(4-nitrophenyl)-7H-<br>
1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine (25.2g) was<br>
hydrogenated in 250 mL (10 volumes) of 2B-3 ethanol using 2.0<br>
g of 10% palladium on carbon and 18.0 g of potassium formate<br>
in 20 mL of water as the hydrogen transfer source. When HPLC<br>
analysis indicated that starting material had been consumed,<br>
the catalyst was removed by filtration. The filtrate was<br>
concentrated by distillation until about 70 mL (3 volumes) of<br>
ethanol remained. Water (93mL, 4 volumes) was added to the<br>
solution at reflux. The mixture was allowed to cool and was<br>
seeded with the crystalline product of Example 9 at 80"C.<br>
The resulting slurry was allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
and stir overnight. The solid was isolated by filtration and<br>
dried in a vacuum oven at 50"C for 24h to afford 19.8g (85%)<br>
of purified product. Analysis showed a non-detectable level<br>
of ethanol (GC) and 1.0% water (KF).<br>
Analysis by XRD, SSNMR and DSC indicated that the Form IV<br>
polymorph was formed.<br>
Example 23<br>
Alternative synthesis of (S)-a—methvl-1,<br>
3-benzodioxole-5-ethanol<br>
To a suspension of magnesium turnings (17 g) in 50 mL<br>
tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise a solution of 5-bromo-l,3-<br>
benzodioxole (93.6 g). After complete addition, the mixture<br>
was diluted with 250 mL tetrahydrofuran and the resulting<br>
mixture was stirred overnight. 13 mL of the solution (0.78<br>
M) was transferred to a round bottom flask containing<br>
copper(I) iodide (0.12 g). The resulting mixture was cooled<br>
to -50 "C and a solution of (S)-(-)-propylene oxide in 3 mL<br>
tetrahydrofuran was slowly added then stirred 10 min. The<br>
mixture was diluted with ether. The isolated organic phase<br>
was washed with water and brine. The aqueous wash was<br>
extracted with ether (2x) and the combined organic solutions<br>
were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.<br>
The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (50%<br>
ether in pentane) to give 1.66 g of the desired product<br>
(91%). Chiral HPLC analysis indicated that the optical<br>
purity of the material was 98.3%.<br>
The ingredients were mixed and filled into size 0 hard<br>
gelatine capsules to a fill weight of 450mg.<br>
