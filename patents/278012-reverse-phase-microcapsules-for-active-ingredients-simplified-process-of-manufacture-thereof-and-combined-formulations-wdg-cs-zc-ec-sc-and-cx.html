				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention is in the field of microencapsulation, particularly in the field of microencapsulation of water soluble<br>
active ingredients in true microcapsules. The field of formulation of agricultural products is also addressed<br>
herein.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention regards microcapsules where a water phase is in inside the core together with<br>
biologically active ingredient(s), simplified process of microencapsulation and mixed formulations (capsule<br>
suspension plus suspension in oil, capsule suspension plus suspension concentrate, etc) and uses thereof<br>
Further, here is described in full for the first time a usable agricultural formulation type that we called Capsule<br>
Mixed Suspension (proposed CX for a new two-letter code of international classification of formulations)<br>
characterized in that the formulation contains: i) a water or oil continuous outer phase ii) microcapsules<br>
containing an oily core with oil-soluble active ingredients and iii) microcapsules containing a watery core with<br>
water-soluble active ingredients iv) suitable coformulants, in particular surface active compounds.<br>
The unitary concept of this invention is the reverse microencapsulation of water soluble (or dispersible)<br>
materials -active ingredients or a.i. -.<br>
The technique of microencapsulation is well known in many fields. One field of special interest for the<br>
inventors is agrochemistry (any type of chemical compounds that are used in agriculture to improve the benefits<br>
of the farmer, including herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, raticides, semiochemicals. viricides, molusquicides.<br>
etc). However fields as cosmetics, medicine, pharmaceutics, etc., may take profit of the same microcapsules<br>
and processes. For simplicity we will focus on agricultural uses.<br>
The a.i. referred herein is in any of its forms, as long as it achieves a biologically technical effect,<br>
Traditionally the a.i. (in short, a.i., the use of the term "a.i." is used in plural, unless it is explicitly understood that<br>
is singular by the context) is referred as to the molecule (or moiety of the molecule) with herbicide, insecticide.<br>
attractant, etc. activity. For example, in an herbicide composition, the a.i. would be the molecule having<br>
herbicidal activity; in a cosmetic preparation, a fungicide that is part of the formulation and is inside the<br>
microcapsules would be an a.i., although such formulation may not be directed primarily to have antifungal<br>
effects (maybe is used for ant-wrinkle effect). The a.i. can be considered as well a safener or penetrator (e.g.<br>
fatty alcohol ethoxylates for "fop" herbicides) in a herbicidal composition or a penetrator enhancer for fungicides<br>
or herbicides (e.g. N-octyl-2-pyrrolidone), or a synergistic compound (e.g., a photosynthesis inhibitor that acts<br>
synergistically with the herbicide "main" a.i.; also a synergist in the case of insecticides of the pyrethroid type<br>
(e.g., pyperonyl butoxide). In other words, anything that has any type of biological activity either in its own or<br>
combined with another compounds, is to be understood as a.i. in the present invention What would not be a i<br>
are, for example clays, buffers, surface active compounds in so far they do not affect significantly the biological<br>
effect of the a.i. and are present in the formulation as technological aids for the purpose of achieving usable<br>
formulation (e.g., stable and perfectly dispersable in the spray tank), etc.<br>
 <br>
The vast majority of known (true -it is said, those that have a wall that makes a physical separation of<br>
the a.i. from the continuous phase, to the contrary of those non-true "microcapsules" made by matrix<br>
encapsulation) microcapsules in the agrochemical field have in their core (discontinuous phase) a water-<br>
insoluble phase, it is said, the content of the microcapsule is oily, unpolar, substantially insoluble in water, and<br>
the microcapsules are dispersed in water (continuous phase). Inside the core may be solids or dispersed<br>
materials. Most of the prior art discloses microcapsules where the oily a.i.(s) is inside the microcapsule. We refer<br>
to it as normal microencapsulation or normal phase microencapsulation (NPµ in short).<br>
However, there are many limitations as to form microcapsules where the continuous media is oily and<br>
the core contains water with water-soluble a.i. This is usually referred as reverse phase microencapsulation<br>
(RPu in short). Patents dealing with RPµ, but providing rather different solutions are US 6531160 (reactive wall<br>
forming materials not suitable for the purposes of this invention), US 6534094 (biodegradable polymer<br>
undesired for our addressed problems, since we need a wall strong to weathering conditions) or US 6572894<br>
(biodegradable wall as well).<br>
The prior art shows an overwhelming presence of NPµ patents and scientific papers over that of RPu<br>
The state of the art presents a very restricted ways as how to produce RPµ. The use of oil soluble isocyanates<br>
or urea/melamine formaldehyde resins is the conventional way of performing NPµ. In the prior art. for achieving<br>
RPu, the chosen wall forming materials must be in the water phase -or at least part of them- at the beginning of<br>
the process, therefore leading to undesired degradation of some a.i. due to the reactive nature of these water-<br>
soluble wall forming materials (e.g., polyols, wherein the hydroxyl group is free to react), difficulting the full<br>
reaction of wall forming materials and leading to microcapsules of 30-100 µrn, bigger and more inhomogeneous<br>
than those obtained in this invention (see Example 10, CEI).<br>
After producing the RPµ, the microcapsules must be mixed with the appropriate coformulants in order to<br>
obtain a functionally usable form of the microcapsules (e.g.. addition of dispersants. wetters skin UV-<br>
protectors...). Normally the NPp microcapsules are formulated in a water phase (e.g., capsule suspensions for<br>
agriculture) or after a drying process yielding water dispersable granules. Therefore; a need of different<br>
coformulants for the RPu process and for the "second" process of formulation may cause logistic problems<br>
especially to small companies wherein the availability of highly special chemicals (coformulants for NPµ or RPµ)<br>
is limited.<br>
One problem addressed in this invention is to obtain in the same commercial formulation NPµ and RPµ<br>
Note that not even one product in the market has ever had this particular feature (double-beneficial<br>
encapsulation of water and oil soluble a.i).<br>
One of the main problems to be solved when performing a microencapsulation (if not the most important<br>
problem) is to choose the right wall forming materials in order that they:<br>
-do not react with the a.i. or coformulants, either by the presence in the same initial water phase or by its lack of<br>
reactivity towards the chosen a.i.<br>
-do polymerize in a controlled way<br>
-do not leave unreacted compounds or toxic compounds after polymerization<br>
 <br>
-do form a polymer with the appropriate thickness, porosity and hydrophobicity to allow the desired controlled<br>
release of the a.i.<br>
-do permit that the size of the microcapsules is sufficient small for a correct functionality<br>
-the distribution of the size to be uniform<br>
This is achieved in this invention by a purposive selection of wall forming materials. The selection of the<br>
wall forming materials according this invention has been done with due account of preserving all the needs state<br>
above and, moreover, are appropriate for the much less usual reverse phase microencapsulation Our selected<br>
wall forming materials allow not only such needs but also allow to microencapsulate a.i. in a high loads without<br>
the use of PVP polymers, also, a very homogeneous particle size distribution, and a very low amount of<br>
unencapsulated material. The use of glycoluril resins makes the process much less dangerous in terms of<br>
human toxicology in front of prior art use of monomer isocyanates (with high toxic profile and volatility) The use<br>
of glycoluril resins also makes the capsules more elastic and resistant to rupture by stresses during the<br>
production and afterwards (e.g., filling machines).<br>
The problems addressed by the invention are several, although the invention can be formulated as to<br>
solve other problems as well, implicitly existing in the RPµ process.<br>
The first problem is to find a reliably, simple and effective process of RPµ having microcapsules with<br>
small and homogeneous particle size and appropriate porosity. Other problem addressed is to be able to<br>
simplify the process of formulating for agriculture the RPµ product in such a way the need of different types of<br>
raw materials for the formulation plant is reduced to a minimum, for logistical and economic reasons Also we<br>
address the need of avoiding or reduce to a minimum the degradation of the a.i. during the process (or even<br>
during storage) due to undesired side reactions. Also, we look for the combination of labile water- and/or oil-<br>
soluble a.i. in the same formulation. Obtaining a dry and stable and functional formulation of microcapsules<br>
made by RPµ, eventually with oil soluble a.i. incorporated in the dry formulation, is also one of our targets Here<br>
is presented for the first time fully functional agricultural formulations wherein the two types of microcapsules are<br>
combined (the CX). There is no commercial product containing combined capsule suspensions (namely, NPµ<br>
and RPp). The prior art shows enabling disclosures of formulations of microcapsules containing water phase in<br>
the core, or, always alternatively, oil phase in the core, but never before an enabling disclosure of a formulation<br>
containing simultaneously two types of microcapsules with a watery-core and an oily-core It is highly surprising<br>
that this need has been never solved during more than 40 years after the first microencapsulation processes<br>
appeared and the increased efforts in the Agro industry to develop new formulations (reducing the investment in<br>
searching new molecules). It is uncontestable that this invention provides a big step forward in the field of<br>
formulation, at the view to the increased patents of the field of formulation and microencapsulation in the last<br>
years, and the fact that no patent addresses this problem of microencapsulating oil and water soluble a.i with<br>
two different techniques and combine the final products.<br>
The invention solves these problems in the following way:<br>
- Providing a new process of RPp with the use of determined wall forming materials, coformulants -those<br>
disclosed herein may be interchangeable with similar ones as far as the functionality is the same (e.g.. with the<br>
 <br>
same HLB and solubility properties) and preferably the molecular structure is similar-, and selective ratios<br>
conditions of reaction and treatment (formulation) of the solution microcapsules formed.<br>
-	Simplifying the process of RPµ in such a way that the same coformulants that are used in the step ot<br>
formulation (same coformulants for different types of finished formulations). We refer to Example 1 to<br>
understand better this solution, where a RPµ Capsule Suspension (CS) formulation is formulated with the same<br>
coformulants as a combined CS-EC formulation (Capsule Suspension + Emulsion Concentrate).<br>
-	Obtaining a very reliable process of RPµ with a sharp distribution of the microcapsule's size without the need<br>
of use prior art coformulants deemed essential till now for RPµ (e.g., polymers of the type of polyvinylpyrrolidone<br>
-PVP-) and without the need of adding any wall forming material in the water phase initially prepared, by means<br>
of choosing oil soluble wall forming materials and avoiding the contact of any water soluble wall-forming material<br>
(that may be present) until at least the emulsification step, wherein the contact of water soluble ingredients is<br>
reduced to a minimum (seconds or minutes at discrete intervals under agitation).<br>
-	Microencapsulating by RPµ the water soluble (or dispersible) a.i. and having the oil soluble ingredient<br>
dispersed or dissolved in the continuous oil phase, with the processes already envisaged above and later mixing<br>
with NPµ.<br>
-	Drying the formed microcapsules, both with a water soluble a.i. as the only a.i.; and also combination of water<br>
soluble a.i. with oil-soluble a.i.. the latter being outside of the microcapsules. It cannot be assessed beforehand if<br>
our RPµ would be stress-resistant to spray drying.<br>
-	Formulating the RPµ in such a way that can be incorporated with other formulations containing NPµ, providing<br>
a completely new approach in the agrochemistry field of formulations -there is not even an international code<br>
(e.g., used by the FAO or by the BCPC) for the type of formulations CX-.<br>
We take a closer view of the prior art at the view of the problems cited.<br>
US 3464926 and US 3577515 (Van de Gaer et al., Pennwalt Corporation) are pioneer inventions in the<br>
field of microencapsulation. As shown in Figures 1 and 2 of US 3464926 and description thereof, the process is<br>
far complicated using flows and industrially complicated paths for the reactants to travel, economically very<br>
costly nowadays to bring into practice. Further, that patent refers only to microencapsulation of pesticides<br>
(diazinon and malathion) in "normal" phase, namely, oil in water, where the oil-soluble insecticide remains inside<br>
the microcapsule.<br>
The RPµ is described in US 3577515 Example 15, with the use of petroleum ether, carbon tetrachloride,<br>
talc, tetraethylene pentamine, calcium hydroxide, water, and dimer acid chloride, being the wall formed by the<br>
reaction of dimer acid chloride with tetraethylene pentamine. This (reactants, microcapsules formed, and<br>
process) process is rather different than the one described in the present invention, where, for example, we<br>
make no use of acid chlorides (highly reactive and likely to degradate a.i. to react to form the wall. No mention of<br>
the use of the RPµ for any agrochemical use is suggested in the case of water in oil microencapsulation, either<br>
the recommended sizes for a good performance in the final application in the field of such microcapsules or<br>
release rate characteristics.<br>
The inventors have observed that, contrary to what is described in the closest prior art US 4524783,<br>
where to form to polyurea wall to microencapsulate the water soluble compounds they use necessarily polyols<br>
 <br>
[Examples 2, 3, 4, 6, 1. 8, 9 and 10] or polyamines [Examples 1 and 5] in the water phase), there is no need of<br>
using any amine or any alcohol or any further compound in the water phase to achieve a the RPµ according to<br>
the present invention. Having wall forming materials in the water phase provokes eventually undesired side<br>
reactions with the a.i. (this fact is so obvious for a skilled in chemistry that we do not provide more information on<br>
this regard). The present invention solves this problem "isolating" the a.i. in the water phase. According to the<br>
present invention, the microencapsulation may be carried out with a water phase that only contains the water<br>
soluble compounds(s) (a.i.) and water. This surpressive possibility of the removal of any additional compound in<br>
the water phase is beneficial for the stability of the water soluble compound(s) to microencapsulate, since the<br>
reactions of decomposition or just any kind of interference, are avoided by virtue of "isolating" the water soluble-<br>
a.i.(s) in a phase, leaving all the rest of the compounds in the other phase (oil phase).<br>
One of the problems addressed in the present invention is to provide a water phase free from wall<br>
forming materials (if needed so) that may interact with the water soluble a.i.(s) to microencapsulate All prior art<br>
cited above use part of the wall forming material to be in the oil phase, US 4,534,783 makes use of diols in the<br>
water phase to react with the adipyl chloride (in example 4) or with the 1,6-Hexamethylenediisocyanate in<br>
example 3, or the amines in example 5, etc. US 6113935 uses in wall forming materials in the water phase; in<br>
Table 1 (examples 2 to 8) the prepolymeric water forming material in the water phase is WS-351-380, or even<br>
urea/formaldehyde in the example 1<br>
US 6359031 (Lykke et al.) performs a RPµ process by virtue of using carboxy-functional polymers to<br>
associate with amine functional reactive monomers in order to avoid that the non-protected (by carboxy groups)<br>
polymers are dispersed in the oil phase -remarking our addressed problem of undesired side reactions due to<br>
reactivity of wall-forming materials-. This solution is far complicated to perform, due to the cost of functionalizing<br>
with carboxy groups the water soluble polymers (implying lack of commercial sources or high prices of proposed<br>
polymers). This solution is appropriate for high-priced final microcapsules, as those described therein for<br>
enzymes, but such solution, as of today, is not viable for industrial application in the field of agrochemistry.<br>
Moreover, the extremely complicated modification of the polymers in order to achieve RPµ, when compared to<br>
this invention, makes more surpressive and inventive the easy solution proposed in the present invention Also<br>
exists the possibility that these carboxy-protected polymers (the carboxy group or reduced aldehydes/ketones or<br>
alcohols) react with the water soluble a.i.(s).<br>
US 6113935 (Rodson and Scher, Zeneca Ltd.), published in 2000, still addresses the microencapsulation<br>
providing a water phase containing the reactive wall forming materials. This approach is preferentially avoided in<br>
the present invention, to avoid any side reaction in between the products to microencapsulate and for the first<br>
time here allowing a reverse microencapsulation with the use of only oil soluble wall forming materials. The<br>
presence of urea or melamine formaldehyde polymers in the water phase makes more difficult the completion till<br>
the end of the wall forming reaction, as well explained in US 6113935 A1, col. 5: "As the polymer wall becomes<br>
more rigid, contact between the active groups on the [water-soluble] prepolymer becomes increasingly more<br>
difficult." This chemical scenario is completely reversed in our case. Since the wall forming materials are in the<br>
oil phase, the increased thickness of the wall will not prevent that the rest of the material self-polymerizes. When<br>
in US 6113935 is said that the polymerization reaction is "self-terminating" is not due to a perfect availability of<br>
 <br>
wall forming materials to react completely (it is not desirable to have rests of toxic unreacted wall forming<br>
materials in the final formulation), rather to the impossibility due to the growth of the wall thickness of complete<br>
reaction of the wall forming materials. Therefore, in US 6113935, it is said "the reaction is self-terminating and is<br>
generally allowed to run to completion", provided this is interpreted in the light of the previous sentence where it<br>
is explained that this completion is due to the difficulty of the active groups of the water soluble prepolymer to<br>
really react completely. In our microencapsulation process, by virtue of the presence of the wall forming<br>
materials in the oil phase, there is indeed a completion of the reaction thanks to the absolutely complete reaction<br>
of the wall-forming materials (to the difference of US 6113935, where the "completion" or 'finishing" is due to<br>
unavailability to react more than the limit given by the wall thickness). Moreover, US 6113935 system does not<br>
provide a solution to use the same process/components (of, e.g., Adjustemt Mixtures A and B from our Example<br>
1) for producing agrochemical formulations that may later be transformed easily in a combined formulation, as<br>
the solution offered in the present invention. No hint is provided as to formulate RPµ with NPµ.<br>
It must be acknowledged that from a scientific point of view, the specialized literature is a source of<br>
guarantied knowledge for the state of the art, in between other things, because are peer reviewed publications,<br>
the prestige and the scientific correctness of the writer is in play and this is the way, how the scientist and<br>
technicians obtain fairly "trusted" information sources. We find in the book "Chemistry of Crop Protection" (Edited<br>
by Voss and Ramos, from the recognized Publisher Wiley-VCH, ISBN 3-527-30540-8) that the solution<br>
proposed by the inventors of the present patent goes against any expectation for the skilled in the art. namely,<br>
our proposal of using the wall forming materials only in the oil phase is disregarded as possible by the<br>
recognized microencapsulation expert George B. Beestman -inventor of one of the few RPµ and process, US<br>
4534783-, in pg. 273 of that book: To prepare the reverse phase W/O (Water-in-Oil) emulsions care must be<br>
taken to select monomers that will remain in the dispersed water droplet during the emulsion stage. If the<br>
monomers diffuse from suspended droplets into the continuous phase polymerization will happen throughout the<br>
emulsion and not at the interface as intended. No microcapsules will be formed". He insists later in the same<br>
paragraph that in a process where amines participate, the microcapsules would have not been produced The<br>
relatively new book (edited in 2003), used as standard reference in this field, does not give any hint into initiating<br>
the emulsification process without any compound in the water phase, lesser to provide the catalyst (in our case<br>
eventually a cycled azo compound) after emulsification has began, rather teaches away from the solution<br>
proposed. This inventiveness shown in the present application must be taken into account when considering that<br>
the closest prior art available is a patent of the author that teaches away from our solution proposed (Beestman<br>
shows a RPµ for water soluble agrochemicals). In the same chapter of Beestman. a mention of in-situ<br>
polymerization is made, but this time no reference of a possible formation of a RPµ is made using this type of<br>
polymerization (in fact, the only envisaged methods in the patent literature of performing a RPµ are those using<br>
the wall forming material either only in the water phase or in both oil and water phases, but not only in the oil<br>
phase as addressed in this invention in its preferred embodiment).<br>
Note that according the invention, it is not addressed only that the water phase contains no wall forming<br>
material, rather, that in our aim to provide a simplified process of production of reverse phase microcapsules for<br>
further addition of other components or transformations in the formulation types -e.g. from a Capsule<br>
 <br>
Suspension (CS) to a CS plus suspension concentrate (SC)-. Although we have found that one of the preferred<br>
embodiments is highly surprising over the state of the art, in the sense of the placing wall forming materials in<br>
the oil phase, nothing prevents the skilled in the art to use other features of this invention with traditional RPµ<br>
with wall forming material in the oil phase, as long as other benefits of this invention are achieved (e.g..<br>
combined RPµ and NPµ (CX formulation)). Then, the disclosure of this invention also embraces embodiments<br>
that have wall-forming materials in both phases, as a less attractive alternative, but possible In this case it is<br>
needed that any material present in the water phase is inert with regard the a.i. and other components of the<br>
(initial) water phase. The term "inert" is well defined and clear in this invention: the water-soluble wall forming<br>
materials must not react, in the presence of water, and in the same proportions that are used in the water phase<br>
preparation of the process described herein, with the water-soluble a.i.(s) chosen, that are in the water phase.<br>
These notes are needed to emphasize that the present invention solves the main problem of finding an<br>
improved process of microencapsulation of water soluble or dispersible a.i., and the partial problems of<br>
facilitating logistical needs and combinations of the microcapsules formed. Each of these partial problems has its<br>
own solution that may be used independently, with the common inventive concept of new RPµ applications. The<br>
same applies to the other partial problems mentioned above.<br>
The invention comprises -when isolating its application in agrochemistry- the combination in a single<br>
formulation, of at least a microencapsulated water soluble agrochemical (preferably glyphosate and/or sulfosate<br>
and/or glufosinate) combined with an oil soluble insecticide outside the microcapsules (preferably sulfonylureas<br>
and/or sulfonamides) or in normal phase microcapsules, in such a way that all the a i. remain stable, and<br>
optionally drying the resulting combination to obtain water dispersable granules containing RPµ and NPµ<br>
encapsulated (also non-encapsulated) sulfonylureas. Some preferred embodiments including sulfonylureas<br>
emanates due to the well-known instability of sulfonamides, and the wide use of glyphosate, sulfosate and<br>
glufosinate. Surprisingly, the inventors have realized that the process to microencapsulate water soluble<br>
herbicides herein disclosed, may be continued with the addition in the oil phase of sulfonylureas without any<br>
detriment to the functionality of the first microencapsulated water-soluble agrochemical or the subsequently<br>
added oil soluble material. Therefore the invention provides using the same process, either RPµ-water-soluble<br>
agrochemical (e.g. glyphosate) or, if desired, RPµ-water-soluble agrochemical plus oil soluble agrochemical<br>
(free or NP-microencapsulated).<br>
It must be noted that the state of the art processes for NPµ, allow to have dry microcapsules containing<br>
oily agrochemicals in the core of microcapsules. These microcapsules can be added (dispersed) in the<br>
continuous phase of a RPµ formulation, in such a way at the end we have a formulation with water-soluble<br>
ingredients microencapsulated but also with oil-soluble ingredients microencapsulated. The dispersion in oil of<br>
such water-dried microcapsules can be done using dispersants of the type sodium alkyl naphthalene sulfonate<br>
cresolformadehyde condensation products, EO/PO block copolymers or metal salts of fatty acid methyl taurides<br>
As wetters for good dispersibility and suspensibility, we propose isotridecyl alcohol ethoxylate. sodium lauryl<br>
sulphate ans metal salts of alkylsulfosuccinate, like sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate.<br>
It is a question of obviousness that, in principle, any water soluble stable small organic molecule (eg<br>
agrochemicals, many medicines, alkaloids, oligopeptides) may be submitted to our RPµ and also that any oil<br>
 <br>
soluble stable small organic molecule (e.g.. agrochemicals, many medicines) may be added to the oil outer<br>
phase.<br>
It is also a question of common knowledge for the skilled in the art which agrochemicals are not<br>
comprised in the scope in the patent, namely, those which for whatever reason would not be able to be used<br>
according the present invention: for example, an inorganic water or oil insoluble fertilizer could not fall in the<br>
scope of the invention if there is no reasonable mean to disperse it in the water or the oil phase; either any a i<br>
that would decompose by thermal degradation at the temperatures set out in the present invention Namely, we<br>
claim that the invention is feasible in all the range of a.i. except those that can obviously not be submitted to our<br>
process. For the selection of the a.i., no undue burden is left to the skilled in the art, rather, only his/her normal<br>
knowledge in the area of microencapsulation and chemistry.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The microencapsulation of the water soluble compound is performed having a water phase, wherein the<br>
water soluble compound (or mixture of water soluble compounds) is(are) dissolved, and an oil phase wherein<br>
the wall forming materials (polymers, prepolymers, oligomers or monomers), the catalyst(s), dispersants and<br>
coformulants are dissolved in an organic solvent.<br>
Water phase<br>
According to this invention, the microencapsulation may be carried out with a water phase that only<br>
contains the water soluble compound(s) and water. The removal of any additional compound in the water phase<br>
before the emulsion step takes place is beneficial for the stability of the water soluble compound(s) to<br>
microencapsulate, since the reactions of decomposition or just any kind of interference, are avoided by virtue of<br>
"isolating" the water soluble a.i.(s) in a phase, leaving all the rest of the compounds in the oil phase. Is also<br>
possible to use water soluble wall forming materials, in so far other problems addressed in this invention are<br>
solved and provided that the water soluble wall forming materials do no react with the a.i<br>
Oil phase<br>
Solvent: Any solvent able to dissolve the a.i. (whether a single a.i. or a combination of oil-soluble a.i.) is<br>
able to be used, as far is inert for the a.i. Usual solvents are vegetal or mineral oils aromatic parafinic or<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons of the type of Solvesso® 100, 150 or 200, Marcol®, Isopar® including aliphatic,<br>
hydrocarbons that are aromatic and mixes thereof etc. More volatile solvents may also be used, as lower<br>
alcohols (e.g., butanol, hexanol, octanol), cyclohexanone, gamma-butyrolactone. N-alkyllactams. N:N-<br>
dimetylalkyl -amides or-amines, and in general, any solvent used in agrochemical products. Preferred are<br>
Wall forming materials: As wall forming materials we select a combination chosen at least from one of<br>
the two groups (preferably from both):<br>
a) isocyanates, preferably, an aliphatic isocyanate, preferably chosen from the group TMXDI, Cythane" 3174<br>
[CYTEC], eventually, and/or an aromatic isocyanate (preferably chosen from TDI, MDI) The short names for<br>
isocyanates used in this invention are well known for the skilled in the art and common in the patent literature.<br>
 <br>
b) glycoluril resins, preferably, Cymel® 1170, Cymel®, 1171 Powderlink® 1174, Cymei 1172 (from CYTEC<br>
Industries<br>
A preferred combination is to choose TMXDI and Cythane® 3174 from group a) together with Cyme!<br>
1170 of group b) with a ratio 10:1 to 1:10 in wt.-% of TMXDI to Cythane® 3174; preferably with a ration in wt.-%<br>
of group a) to group b) from 15:1 to 2:1<br>
Catalysts: Any catalyst able to catalyze the polymerization reaction is able to be used. Dialkyltin fatty<br>
acids are preferred, in particular dibutyl tin laureate. Also a cyclic (di- or tri- or tetra-cyclo) (mono-, di-. tri-, tetra-<br>
)aza catalyst, is used, preferably {1,8-}Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene [in short, DBU]. The azacyclo catalyst<br>
may belong either to the initial oil phase or to the emulsion water in oil solution that is formed during the process<br>
(introduced dissolved in oil right after the beginning of the emulsification, this is our preferred solution, since<br>
better control of reaction is achieved). This way, it reacts (and is preferentially located) on the interface of the<br>
water and oil phases with the wall forming materials. The DBU is preferably used as a solution in the oil solvent<br>
preferably from 5-50% in wt.-%. Any coformulant that is water soluble and may be functionally of interest for the<br>
final formulation might be added in the initial water phase (e.g., a dispersant for water-dispersed a.i. with low<br>
affinity for the chosen oil phase). In order to speed the reaction when using glycoluril resins, a catalyst of the<br>
type proton transfer catalysts (preferably of the type p-toluensulfonic acid and derivatives) is recommended<br>
although we have surpressively observed that is not necessary. The glycolurils are incorporated in the mixed<br>
polyurea-gllycoluril wall without the need of these recommended sulfonic acids<br>
Coformulants: For the purposes of obtaining a water phase as "pure' as possible, the coformulants will<br>
preferably be oil soluble and be in the oil phase. However, inert coformulants may be added to the water phase<br>
as desired, as it can be the case of antifreeze agents (e.g., propylen- or diethylen- or polypropylene- glycol) pH<br>
adjusters, antioxidants, UV-protectors, etc. Preferably there will be used surfactants and dispersants, in the oil<br>
phase, of the type Atlox® 4914, Atlox® LP-6 or/and LP-1, and any conventional surfactants that may easily be<br>
found in catalogs (e.g., Clariant, ICI, Rodhia surfactant/dispersant catalogs) with similar functionality as those<br>
mentioned For the purposes of achieving a good microencapsulation, no other coformulants are needed in our<br>
process. However, any further coformulants that may be needed for a good performance of the final formulation<br>
(e.g., wetters, binders, other dispersants, etc.) may be added in this oil or water phase, or preferably at the end<br>
of the process.<br>
EMULSIFICATION-MICROENCAPSULATIONSTEP<br>
Once we have both oil and water phases, we just perform an emulsification step, that in laboratory<br>
conditions may be done with an Ultraturrax L4 at 30-95°C for 2-20 minutes. After the first minute of<br>
emulsification, the azo catalyst is to be added slowly. At this stage the structure of the wall of the microcapsules<br>
is already initiated and partially terminated. The emulsion is left with gentle agitation (anchor stirrer for example)<br>
at 40-80°C for 30-240 minutes in order to cure the microcapsules. We already have the microencapsulated<br>
formulation of water soluble compound.<br>
 <br>
FORMULATION STEP<br>
If the final product is an agrochemical formulation, we need to add further components in order that the<br>
product will be emulsifiable in water. For this purpose we can use compounds of the type Atlox® G-5000.<br>
Dispersing Agent LFH®, Atlox® MBA 13/8, Attagel® 50 (preferably in solution 10-90 wt.-%) and eventually more<br>
solvent.<br>
At this stage we already have a fully functional agrochemical formulation ready to be use by the farmer<br>
(emulsification in the water tank and spray).<br>
The applicant have invented this process in order that further combination with other oil-soluble<br>
agrochemicals is surpressively easy when using the process described above.<br>
From the formulation obtained above, it can be just added the oil soluble a.i. (or mixture of a.i.) in pure<br>
form -if liquid- or preferably dissolved in the same solvent that constitutes the oil continuous phase described<br>
above.<br>
This process allows the producer to convert easily a capsule suspension formulation (in reverse phase,<br>
namely with oil as continuous phase) into a mixture of a capsule suspension with an emulsion concentrate<br>
We have surpresively found that to the "microencapsulated in water phase"-material it can be added (as<br>
continuous phase) an oil suspension (e.g., by emulsification) of water-soluble material that has been previously<br>
milled and stabilized in the oil with the aid of coformulants (mainly dispersants for homogeneicity), namely to for<br>
a suspension in oil + capsule suspension formulation.<br>
The water phase inside the microcapsules may contain water-insoluble a.is dispersed in such water<br>
phase, plus coformulants to stabilize the suspension. These are variants of the present invention that the skilled<br>
in the art may reproduce with common knowledge in the field. A need in the case of mixing water-soluble<br>
compounds with water-insoluble compounds that are milled (dispersed in the water inside the microcapsules) is<br>
that they are not chemically incompatible. In the case of addition of oil-dispersed a.i.. the process described<br>
above is directly useful, since there is no way in which the oil-dispersed a.i. will go inside the microcapsules. In<br>
the case that is added in the initial water phase a water-dispersed a.i., care must be taken in order that during<br>
the emulsification process the water insoluble a.i. (intended to be inside the microcapsule) does not go into the<br>
oil phase: for this reason, only compounds that are insoluble in water, and at the same time insoluble (not readily<br>
soluble) in the chosen solvent (oil phase) are able to be incorporated according the present invention<br>
Otherwise, we have seen that a high migration to the outer oil phase. In these cases of looking for a good<br>
dispersion in water, the better approach is to look for an oil phase wherein the water-insoluble a.i is also not<br>
soluble. This may be the case where the a.i. is soluble in low molecular weight solvents (eg , tebuconazole as<br>
a.i. in cyclohexanone) but is substantially insoluble in naphtha solvents (e.g.. tebuconazole in Solvesso 100) In<br>
this case, the tebuconazole could be milled and suspended in the water phase (nitrogen atoms of tebuconazole<br>
show affinity for water) and would not go preferentially to the Solvesso 100. thus allowing the<br>
microencapsulation of both the water-soluble a.i. and the water-insoluble a.i. The selection of the oil phases that<br>
is the best for avoiding this migration of the milled water-insoluble a.i., is a routine task based on the selection of<br>
the oil phase solvent.<br>
 <br>
The possible formulations obtainable by this invention are provided in the following scheme:<br>

 <br>
In order to achieve a CX formulation, in the examples are given the preferred surfactants: they must<br>
satisfy that the RPµ to be mixed with a NPµ (or viceversa) are in a quantity from 1-50%. preferably 5-25% and<br>
more preferably 10-20% in the formulation to be combined. To mix a RPµ into a NPµ surfactants with high HLB<br>
are needed, with a HLB of 7-14, preferably 8-14 and more preferably 9-13. To mix a NPµ into a RPµ surfactants<br>
with low HLB are needed, with a HLB of 1-7, preferably 1-5, and more preferably from 2-5. As first choice, the<br>
skilled in the art trying to reproduce the invention should try the proposed surfactants in the concentrations set in<br>
the section Examples. When failing these trials, increase on the concentration of surfactants of 10% is to be<br>
tested, then selecting two or three similar surfactants (but with different molecular formula) with similar HLB If<br>
this two short tests fail, then a surfactant (preferably with same formula but with changed number of<br>
ethoxylated/propoxylated mols) an increased or decreased HLB (respectively for mixing RPµ to NPµ and for<br>
mixing NPµ to RPµ) is to be tried. These basic and necessary adjustments, following these recommendations<br>
have been proved to work for at least 25 different combinations of a.i. and concentrations of a.i. by the inventors<br>
therefore this process is deemed to be workable in all the claimed range of existing agrochemicals In all these<br>
trials, the first choice solvent for the NPµ is of type naphtha, as second choice parafinic oils, and as third choice<br>
vegetable oils (preferably hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated). As a rule, the minimum deviation from the<br>
surfactants and solvents and wall forming materials, is preferred to be able to perform workable formulations<br>
In order to obtain water dispersable granules from CX formulations (or all the other possibilities<br>
mentioned in the invention containing RPµ) we have seen that the best procedure is to provide a matrix for<br>
absorbing the oil, with customary aids for drying for each batch, in particular for spray drying (by analogy, in the<br>
extrusion processes). The most preferred way to perform this step of drying RPµ or CX-containing formulations<br>
is by spray-drying, adding to the spray chamber absorbants or adsorbants of the type caolin. clays o-<br>
carbohydrates (starches, carboxymethylcellulose, cyclodextrins; and derivatives, etc.) Again, the lesser deviation<br>
from the examples, the better results are expected.<br>
We have surpresively found that most of the emulsifiers adequate for performing emulsification of oils<br>
into water may be used without any interference with the capsule suspension stability in the final CX formulation<br>
Therefore, we include herein those surfactants appropriate for forming oil in water emulsions, as extensively<br>
explained in catalogs, e.g. that of Uniquema catalogs available on Internet (www.uniquema com) and in hard<br>
copy, cp/e/9-99/-/eur/02/1 k (adjuvants) or cp/e/9-99/-/eur/03/1 k (Formulation additives) This is evidently not<br>
obvious, since the mentioned products are though not at all for emulsifying oil containing capsules, rather only to<br>
emulsify oils in water. No mention therein is made that capsule suspensions would be stable when emulsifying a<br>
RPµ formulation into a NPµ with high HLB surfactants (or the reverse for NPµ into NPµ with low HLB<br>
surfactants). Indeed, we believe that in our invention is for the first time shown the stability of microcapsules<br>
when mixing RPµ and NPµ (or viceversa) when using conventional surfactants.<br>
For reasons of clarity, we will discuss in detail the invention related with the claims (each paragraph<br>
marked refers to the claim number pointed out).<br>
 <br>
§1 The invention provides microcapsules for controlled release of water soluble or dispersible compounds,<br>
preferably agrochemicals, characterized in that the microcapsule have a polymeric wall consisting in the in-situ<br>
reaction polymeric product of the only oil soluble material(s) selected from at least one of the groups i) or ii)<br>
more preferably at least one of each group, and most preferably one of each group:<br>
i) at least a glycoluril resin, preferably a tetra-butoxylated glycoluril resin<br>
ii) at least an isocyanate, preferably an aliphatic polyisocyanate resin<br>
and, when chosen from both types, the ratio of ii) to i) is at the most 20:1 and at least 1 2<br>
and the average size of the microcapsules is from 0.1 urn to 50 µm. preferably 1 to 5 µm, and the size percentile<br>
90 of the microcapsules is at the most 200 µm, preferably 35µm, when measured in dispersion in water in a<br>
laser diffraction apparatus, optionally of the type Mastersizer™.<br>
It is quite relevant the term "oil soluble" materials, which form the wall: this means in the present claim that the<br>
wall forming materials are in the oil phase and only in the oil phase when performing the microencapsulation<br>
However, this technical feature is reflected as well in the finished microcapsules (since the wall is formed only by<br>
oil soluble polymers) therefore we direct a claim to the product itself, not necessarily as a product by process<br>
claim.<br>
The prior art in RPµ show that the wall forming materials must be selected from melamine-formaldehyde or<br>
urea-formaldehyde resins (as in US 6113935, claim 1 a)) placed on the water phase or the polymer formed is a<br>
polyamide, polyurea, polyurethane, polysulfonamide, polyesther or polycarbonate (as in US 4534783). wherein<br>
the wall forming materials are also placed (at least some of them necessarily) in the water phase. The formation<br>
of a glycoluril-polyurea polymer for reverse phase microencapsulation is new, and provides advantages over the<br>
prior art. Repetion of example 10 of US 4534783 yield microcapsules with a mean particle size of 74 pm with a<br>
percentile 90 of 398 pm. A further attempt to achieve smaller microcapsules with the basis of a polyurea wall,<br>
led indeed to smaller microcapsules, but then part of the IPA salt crystallized (about 13%) in the oil phase<br>
Repetition of examples 2 and 8 of US 6113935 lead to very big microcpasules (actually the denomination of<br>
microcapsules begins to be no more applicable) with a mean diameter of 289 pm and 310 pm respectively, with<br>
a percentile 90 at 1512 pm. It is clear that exists the need of small microcapsules that are able to be attached to<br>
the points of action of the respective compound (e.g., a fungicide or herbicide inside of microcapsules will<br>
perform better is the size allows a better attachment to the fungi or the leaves, and this is directly dependent with<br>
the size), further, for some cosmetic applications smaller microcapsules resist much better stresses due to<br>
mixing operations or even high pressure homogenization processes. Another advantage of the smaller size of<br>
microcapsules is that they have a faster release due to the higher surface provided by the smaller spheres (and<br>
in the case that a fast release wants to be avoided, our invention solves this increasing the percentage of wall<br>
forming materials over the total weight, in that way. the wall is thicker, attenuating the release, but with similar<br>
outer diameter)<br>
Even more important is the homogeneicity of the microcapsules (that the maximum possible of the<br>
microcapsules are very close to the mean, namely, is a pronounced leptocurtic Gaussian distribution, in other<br>
words the peak showing microcapsules' count versus size is as sharp as possible (see attached particle size<br>
 <br>
measurements). This homogeneicity is also fundamental to obtain a product with reliable functionality. While in<br>
the field of normal phase microencapsulation (NPµ) some of these problems have been solved, the special<br>
characteristics of the RPµ, led these needs not to have been solved till now. In order to make clear what is one<br>
of the multiple advantages of this invention, the size preferred must be in between 0 1 to 25 urn in average and<br>
to have homogeneous, sharp distribution, the percentile 90 we recommend to be under 50 urn Naturally, we<br>
obtain bigger microcapsules just by decreasing the amount of emulsifier and reducing the shearing stress during<br>
the emulsification step.<br>
The material to be microencapsulated may be a single compound or a combination of compounds: eg<br>
in an herbicide formulation, diquat and paraquat; in a medicinal formulation against asthma, caffeine and<br>
theophylline and theobromine.<br>
The compounds to microencapsulate must be water soluble or water dispersible, normally used at a<br>
concentration below the solubility limit of solubility the chosen compounds. However the compounds may be<br>
over its solubility limit (therefore, part will be solubilized and part precipitated). The requirement for such<br>
embodiment is that the compound used over the solubility in water limit, especially the solid part, is thoroughly<br>
dispersed in the water with the use of commercial common water dispersants. This a routine task that can be<br>
accomplished by adding to the water phase a water-soluble dispersant and a previous milling of the water phase<br>
(or an aliquot of the water phase) in a conventional milling machine to the desired particle size<br>
Another requirement for the invention to be workable is that the solubility of this solid compound in the<br>
chosen oil phase is very low or at least lower than that in water. For example, acifluorfen-sodium (solubility in<br>
water about 60 g/L) could be formulated at 100 g/L in the core of the microcapsules, the 40 g/L that would be in<br>
solid form due to reaching the solubility limit should be not soluble, or few soluble in the oil phase Therefore we<br>
could chose hexane as the matrix of the oil. phase or even isooctanol, where the solubility is around 6 g/L Due<br>
to the chosen initially water phase and the water-dispersants used, the water-dispersed acifluorfen-sodium will<br>
tend to stay in the water phase and not displace to the oil phase before the microcapsules are formed It is<br>
contemplated that the a.i. is insoluble in water, and it is dispersed therein, but is at the same time insoluble -or at<br>
least less soluble than in water- in the oil phase. We will refer in this document as something insoluble' or<br>
"substantially insoluble" when the solubility is lower than 1 g/L, with respect to the phase referred in each case<br>
For example, we could mill the fungicide tebuconazole (insoluble in water) in water, and then use a unpolar<br>
solvent as the "matrix" of the oil phase (namely, majoritary compound of the oil phase, when used several<br>
unpolar solvents these considered together would be the matrix), provided that tebuconazole is also insoluble in<br>
such oil phase. As a example, we could chose hexane, wherein the tebuconazole has a solubility lower than 0 1<br>
g/L.<br>
Both microencapsulations of acifluorfen-sodium and tebuconazole have shown to work (homogeneous<br>
microcapsules of mean diameter of, respectively, 9 and 11 urn, and negligible presence of the a is in the oil<br>
phase by, respectively, HPLC-UV and GC-FID analysis).<br>
A further advantage of using glycoluril resins is that they, by chemical structure, are much less reactive<br>
than the conventional urea and melamine resins, therefore allowing a better control of the reaction when<br>
performed in industrial size.<br>
 <br>
We also claim:<br>
§2 Microcapsules wherein the microcapsule have a polymeric wall consisting in the reaction of:<br>
i) a glycoluril resin, preferably a tetra-butoxylated glycoluril resin<br>
ii) an aliphatic polyisocyanate resin, preferably of the type Cythane® 3714, combined with<br>
TMXDI<br>
wherein in the polymerization reaction it is used at least a catalyst selected from one or the two the<br>
groups<br>
i) polycyclic azo compound, preferably [di-, tri- or tetra-]cyclo [mono- di-. tri- or tetra-jaza<br>
catalyst, preferably a diazabicyclo catalyst, more preferably {1,8-}Diazabicyclo[5 4 0]undec-<br>
7-ene.<br>
ii) a non-nitrogenated oil-soluble catalyst, preferably dialkyl tin fatty acid ester, and more<br>
preferably dibutyl tin laurate<br>
preferably with one catalyst from each group and most preferably the combination of {1.8-<br>
}Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and dibutyl tin laurate<br>
In this case, we want to point out what is the preferred solution that we adopt, namely the combination of<br>
the said wall forming materials, and that the wall is formed (therefore the microcapsules is also characterize by<br>
that) with the aid of the mentioned catalysts. Further the selection of the catalyst i) is advantageous because we<br>
have surpresively noticed that if we add such catalyst right after the emulsification is begun, the catalyst is able<br>
to perform the wall forming reaction. Further, it is our best solution found to combine these two types of<br>
catalysts, another surprising effect of this invention, since what is prior art is to use one catalyst of one type, and<br>
not two catalysts as we propose optionally. The reaction is achieved equally by the use only of dibutyl tin laurate,<br>
but the size of the microcapsules is then increased by about 10%. Obvious variations of catalysts structures<br>
also work in our invention (e.g., dibutyl tin stearate, triaza catalysts, tricycle catalysts, etc.), in any case is a<br>
question of elementary chemical synthesis knowledge to disregard which catalyst could not perform enough well<br>
the reaction.<br>

Not only this water soluble ingredients may be microencapsulated according the present invention<br>
cosmetics and pharmaceutical a.i. water-soluble, and not readily reactive with the wall forming materials may be<br>
microencapsulated.<br>
Although some of these compounds (active ingredient) are few soluble in water this solubility is<br>
acceptable for the purposes of the invention since this low solubility may suffice for bioactivity in especial for<br>
those agrochemicals highly active at very low doses. However, the easier use, in the sense of higher dosage<br>
and no need of dispersion, of the present invention is for those compounds with solubility in water at least of<br>
10% in wt.-%. It is to be understood that the list provides the most common chemical names of the a.i.. in the<br>
most common form. Obviously, for this list, and for all other mentioned a.i. in this document (e.g.. oil soluble a.i i<br>
salts or the methyl derivatives or demethylated derivatives of mentioned compounds are explicitly included (e.g.<br>
glyphosate includes glyphosate-ammonium, glyphosate-isopropylammonium, glyphosate trimesium, and so on).<br>
What is important is that the biologically active part of the molecule represented by the abovementioned<br>
representative compounds is present in the derivatives. This also includes isomers and stereoisomers and<br>
different crystal forms. When the salt is soluble in water and the free (e.g. acid) form is insoluble in water, then<br>
for the purposes of microencapsulation on claim 3, we refer only to the water-soluble forms<br>
§4 The invention is suitable as well for active ingredients not classified in the agrochemical field, as drugs or<br>
medicines, living or death organisms in any physiological state including spores or pollen, such as<br>
mycoplasmas, fungi, bacteria, virus, viroids, prions, yeasts, plants, or genetic material, cells, stem cells, cells for<br>
xenotransplantation, aminoacids, nucleic acids. DNA, RNA, proteins, aminoacids, vaccines or compounds<br>
directed for feeding purposes. There no specific feature in the present invention that prevents to be used for the<br>
mentioned purposes, except of the temperature and the shear stresses needed in our process The skilled in the<br>
art is able to determine case by case when the invention has no application, e.g., for microencapsulation of heat<br>
sensitive cells or a protein that is both denaturalized and lose its biological activity at 40 "C. temperature that is<br>
needed for the curing of the microcapsules.<br>
 <br>
The skilled can also determine when the chosen isocyanates or glycoluril compounds will result in degradation<br>
of the bioactive ingredients and therefore this invention cannot be used. In any case this is to decide in a case-<br>
by-case basis. There is an increasing need to formulate the abovementioned materials in the medical and<br>
biotechnological and chemical field. Up to now, microencapsulation of such materials has been done by<br>
completely different process, mainly by coacervation, because the inherent difficulty in obtaining reverse phase<br>
microcapsules. We are not aware of any public document that approach the solution of this problem with our<br>
microcapsules, lesser without our process, and the prior art, by avoiding systematically the in-situ true (namely<br>
not sponge-type microcapsules) microencapsulation with wall forming materials in the water phase, teaches<br>
away from our solution. The closest prior art regarding this claim could be WO 89/04170, but they do not yielo<br>
spherical "true" microcapsules, rather an amorphous and unhomogeneous organic matrix wherein the viruses<br>
ore bacterial spores are entrapped. Our experiments show that the reduced claimed size of the capsules 5-50<br>
urn cannot obtained directly by an in-situ reaction where the wall entraps absolutely the water and water-<br>
suspended materials (as happens in our invention), rather, by spray drying the matrix (sponge-type capsules)<br>
Namely, only by spray drying such small size of the matrix-encapsulated materials can be reached (this is in<br>
agreement with WO 89/04170, wherein only example 11 show the (mean) particle size after spray drying. On<br>
the other hand, the wall forming material of that invention (Eudragit, polyacrylates, etc.) are far different from the<br>
used in the present invention.<br>
§5 The microcapsules so far described can be used in a dry or flowable form. A very easy way to perform this<br>
embodiment is to microencapsulate in a highly volatile solvent (e.g., octane) and after encapsulation evaporate<br>
the solvent by simple heating, preferably under vacuum. If this is to be performed it is convenient that- before the<br>
evaporation step, the oil phase contains antiagglomerating agents, and those coformulants known by the skilled<br>
in the art to facilitate flowable formulations (e.g., clays, aluminosilicates, etc.) available in any specialized book<br>
Antother way to obtain dry microcapsules (free from solvent) is to perform a state of the art unitary operation of<br>
filtration or centrifugation.<br>
It is also possible that a further oil soluble compound, more specifically, an oil-soluble active ingredient, is in the<br>
form of suspension in the oil phase. Then the drying step or the filtration (or ultrafiltration) step will render a<br>
mixture of flowable microcapsules and oil soluble ingredient in solid form. To make this mixture usable, any state<br>
of the art process for facilitating the flowability may be used. A particular embodiment included in this claim is the<br>
formation of water dispersable granules starting from the solution of microcapsules. The known methods of<br>
spray-drying of normal phase microcapsules may be used for this purpose. Must be noted that the prior art does<br>
not describe at all either the need of agricultural water dispersable granules (problem not addressed) with<br>
reverse phased moicrocapsules or the way how to obtain them It is clear that a controlled release of water<br>
soluble agrochemicals has its advantages, the same as all already claimed for normal microencapsulation<br>
It is inventive to obtain water dispersible granules from RPµ since the different situation of the oil and water<br>
phase affect extremely how the coformulants to obtain the WDG must be selected (mainly oil-soluble in this<br>
 <br>
case). Surpressively we have found that the evaporation of a solvent instead of the traditional evaporation of<br>
water does not affect the possible use of the microcapsules of claim 1 in the form of water dispersable granules<br>
§6 The microcapsules of claim 1. although in principle they are obtained with an oil phase as external and<br>
continuous phase, can be dryed and then redispersed again in a watery media (optionally with other hydrophyllic<br>
solvents, e.g., ethanol for medical applications), with the aid of necessary surface active compounds. The<br>
process to obtain this formulation would be, for example: 1) spray dry or evaporating the resulting<br>
microcapsule's dispersion in oil according the claimed method 2) redisperse this microcapsules in a water media<br>
with the necessary coformulants, at least with surface active compounds, This surface active compounds can<br>
be, for example, a mixture of arabic gum, and soy lecithin at 15% in water, being the concentration ot<br>
micrcapsules at 20 % (wt.-%).<br>
A further dispersing agent is recommended, as the Dispersing Agent LFH and optionally also Atlox G-5000<br>
Then we have water microencapsulated compound(s) dispersed in water, with the ecological advantages that<br>
this kind of formulation have (in agriculture), or the other advantages in cosmetics or phaemaceuticals that are<br>
directly consequence of avoiding any organic solvent in a formulation of the microcapsules according claim 1.<br>
§7 This invention provides a solution to have the microcapsules surrounded by an external oil phase with the aid<br>
of necessary surface active compounds. Even if the process described below provides an oil phase surrounding<br>
(containing) the microcapsules it is possible to "substitute" this oil phase by another oil phase, by means of<br>
filtering/drying -from solvent- the microcapsules and redispersing them in another solvent. This acquires its best<br>
significant when, by needs of the process, the desired final formulation of microcapsules must have an oil phase<br>
wherein the microencapsulation reaction cannot be carried out. For example, if we would like to have a liquid<br>
amine derivative as organic unpolar solvent as a continuous phase in the final formulation, this could not be<br>
directly obtained by the process described in this invention, due to the nature of the purposively selected wall<br>
forming materials (the amine groups would react with the isocyanates immediately). Therefore it would be<br>
needed this "two-step" change of continuous oil phase.<br>
§8 The process proposed to arrive to the desired microcapsules containing a water phase and water soluble<br>
and/or water dispersible compound(s) therein consist in the steps.<br>
1) providing an aqueous phase containing at least one compound -active ingredient- to be<br>
microencapsulated, preferably at least one water soluble or dispersable compound, preferably an<br>
agrochemical, optionally at least a water soluble surface active ingredient, optionally water soluble<br>
surfactant(s), antioxidants, UV-protectors, emetics, clays, and in the case that the active<br>
ingtredient(s) is(are) to be totally or partially dispersed in water, a water dispersing agent<br>
eventually milling it(them) in an aliquot of the water phase to disperse such active ingredient(s)<br>
provided that if there is any solid a.i. in the water phase, the affinity for the water phase must be<br>
higher than the affinity for the oil phase 2)<br>
 <br>
2)	providing an oil phase containing at least an unpolar solvent substantially insoluble in water<br>
preferably a naphtha solvent or aliphatic or aromatic petroleum distillate, vegetable or mineral oils<br>
the wall forming materials selected from the group: glycoluril resins, preferably fully butoxylateo<br>
glycoluril resin, aliphatic isocyanate resins, preferably of the chemical type Cymel® 3741, and<br>
preferably combined with TMXDI; and at least oil soluble surface active ingredient(s) preferably<br>
and a catalyst of the type dibutyltinlauralte an optionally a proton transfer catalyst (but necessarily if<br>
no catalyst is added in step 3).<br>
3)	emulsifying the aqueous phase into the oil phase, at a temperature of 40 to 60"C this step initiates<br>
the in situ polymerization reaction of the wall forming materials onto the water droplets, optionally<br>
adding oil soluble catalyst when the polymerization reaction has already begun -preferably DBU or<br>
any similar azapolycyclo catalyst-, about 5-30 minutes after the addition of the water phase to the<br>
oil phase (but necessarily if no catalyst is added in step 2)<br>
4)	raising the temperature for the curing of the microcapsules to 60 - 100°C<br>
5)	Adding to the resulting dispersion of microcapsules in oil further coformulants soluble or dispersible<br>
in oil suface active coformulants, optionally clays, aluminosilicates, viscosity modifiers, antioxidants<br>
UV-protectors, wetting agents, perfumes, emetics; optionally this addition is made dissolving<br>
previously these coformulants into the same unpolar solvent(s)<br>
It is meant that it can be microencapsulated one or several compounds. When referred to "compounds' we refer<br>
to the a.i. of the microencapsulated formulation.<br>
It is excluded from the scope of the invention such combination of a.i., coformulants. solvents, wall forming<br>
materials that are chemically incompatible. This is easy to know by the skilled chemist based on the chemical<br>
characteristics of the compounds, and in the case of doubt a simple error and trial step will ciarify if the invention<br>
may be applied for a determined combination of a.i. and coformulants<br>
In the claim that reflects this process, the active ingredient(s) [a.i] is(are) meant to be inside the microcapsules<br>
In the step 1) it is contemplated the possibility that:<br>
a)	the a.i. is fully water soluble at the concentration used<br>
b)	the a.i. is water soluble, but the concentration in the water phase is over the solubility limit then part<br>
of the a.i. would be precipitated<br>
c)	the a.i. in insoluble in water<br>
In the cases b) and c), in order that the invention is workable, such a.i. must be able to be dispersed in the water<br>
phase. For that, the common catalogs of dispersing agents' distributors provide enough information to choose<br>
the right dispersant for each a i. It is also possible to perform a milling step in water containing the a.i until<br>
reaching a determined particle size, preferable below 100 urn, this pre-step being done preferably with the aid of<br>
a dispersant chosen according common knowledge for the formulation chemist.<br>
 <br>
In order that during the emulsification step the solid particles are not "expelled out" of the water phase it is<br>
needed that the a.i. is at the same time insoluble in the oil phase chosen for step 2), or at least and more<br>
importantly, that the affinity for such oil phase is lower to that of the water phase Obvioisly. the skilled in the art<br>
will chose the right oil phase in which such solid particles are not soluble in it. This information is customarily<br>
provided in the material data sheets of the a.i., or in general information on the product or catalogs or in the<br>
Pesticide Manual (BCPC, ISBN 1-901396-34-7), Merck Index, etc. In such documents it can be seen in which<br>
solvents the a.i. is insoluble. It is not to expect that the coformulants would provoke a drastic change on the<br>
solubility of the chosen a.i. that would deviate from the information provided in such catalogs/publications In the<br>
few cases that is needed, a trial and error test of partitioning a small quantity of the a.i. in between the two<br>
phases (e.g. in a separatory funnel of 250 mL), and then visualizing where the solid particles tend to be or its<br>
dissolution behavior under shaking. For extremely accurate results, a usual GC or HPLC chromatographic<br>
analysis of each phase would be sufficient to quantify the solubility.<br>
There are hundreds of possible coformulants for the water phase that may be used according our invention. The<br>
selection of them is, however, obvious. A UV-labile water soluble compound would need the presence of a UV<br>
protector, always choosing as first choice those coformulants that are water soluble. An easily oxidabie<br>
pharmaceutical a.i. would need (maybe) the presence of an antioxidant, e.g., ascorbic acid. A formulation<br>
containing microbiologically degradable compounds may need the presence of a water soluble microbiological<br>
agent (e.g. nipagin, nipasol). An a.i. that is highly toxic may be convenient to be microencapsulated with an<br>
emetic (e.g., in the case of diquat or paraquat would be reasonable to use an emetic).<br>
The oil phase of 2) comprises substantially (generally &gt;50% in wt.-%) an unpolar solvent, it is said, immiscible<br>
with water. The selection of the oil phase is generally done in the view of:<br>
-	approved solvents for each purpose (e.g., for agricultural formulations, the unpolar solvent must be<br>
selected from the corresponding list of approved solvents for agrochemicals; for pharmaceutical<br>
formulations, those solvents approved respectively, etc).<br>
-	the solubility of the a.i. to be microencapsulated, and eventually secondary a.i. in the water phase (e.g.<br>
synergistical raticide) (e.g., the a.i. must be not soluble of very low soluble in the unpolar sovent chosen,<br>
normally with a solubility lower than that in water)<br>
-	the suitability for the microencapsulation step (e.g., not reactive with isocyanates or glycoluril resins)<br>
-	the solubility of a oil soluble a.i. that is pretended to be placed in the oil phase, to form a formulation with<br>
a.i. both in the microencapsulated water phase and in the oil phase (same criteria of selection as<br>
mentiones above applies, namely, catalogs, handbooks, MSDSs, etc)<br>
We will refer for common sources of information for the selection of the appropriate unpolar solvent: e.g.. lists of<br>
approved unpolar (organic) solvents for agriculture in the case of the application of the invention in this area<br>
 <br>
Features in this claim 8 referring to the wall forming materials have been already being discussed above. We<br>
insist in that the application of glycoluril resins for formation of microcapsules in reverse phase have never been<br>
disclosed, also has not beed disclosed the purposive selection of TMXDI in the field of RPµ While this<br>
compound is very well known in NPµ, no application of it in the RPµ has been reported or at least the better<br>
results obtained with it in the RPµ over other isocyanates. Worthy to note the abovementioned general<br>
knowledge book in what it is stated that the wall forming materials for RPµ must be in the water phase, being our<br>
solution then against the prior art beliefs.<br>
The step 3) consists in the emulsification, with the novel and surpresive feature that, in the best form to<br>
reproduce the invention, we use both a non-nitrogenated proton transfer catalyst and a polycyclo-polyaza<br>
catalyst that is added in watery solution but -distinctive feature- only after the emulsification and polymerization<br>
reaction has begun. This avoids any side reaction in the water phase prior to the reaction itself Prior art shows<br>
always that the catalyst is present in the water phase as part of it, and it is nowhere suggested that the addition<br>
of the water-soluble catalysts can be done on the reactor itself. Moreover, we show how this cycloaza catalysts<br>
are very appropriate for RPµ. It is absolutely not direct the conclusion that if this catalyst type works for NPµ. it<br>
will work in RPµ, lesser adding it when we do it.<br>
Once the microcapsules are formed -step 4)-, the curing (hardening and fixation of the wall) is performed by<br>
raising the temperature. For those a.i. thermally label is preferably a longer curing period (e.g. at 45-55 o:C<br>
during several hours (e.g., 6 h) than a preferred temperature of 70 °C for 1 h.<br>
The step 5) is an optional step to accomplish a "ready to use" formulation right on the reactor where the<br>
microencapsulation has taken place. The quantity and type of coformulants to add will depend strongly on the<br>
final use of the formulation, and the area of use (cosmetic, agricultural, nutraceutical, etc). The same common<br>
sense and sources of information for the choice of coformulants mentioned above for the water phase applies<br>
here. As far as preferably the coformulants added at this step are oil soluble, it is sometimes better to take a<br>
certain amount of the unpolar solvent used in 2). then mix the coformulants in a fast way by high shear stress,<br>
and then add this portion to the total (this way we do not destroy microcapsules in the mixing of coformulants) If<br>
time is not limiting, the coformulants may be added just by gently anchor stirring (e.g., 10-40 rpm).<br>

Note that the relevance of the list is to achieve a perfect agriculturally functional formulation The long<br>
list is not provided to confuse the skilled in the art, since the microcapsules either the process are affected<br>

active ingredient where our invention may be applied, we provide for the purposes of clarity and enabling the<br>
invention a limited but comprehensive list of workable coformulants.<br>
Although the present invention offers various possibilities regarding the solvents to use for the oil phase,<br>
these does not represent problem of selection, since the specialized scientific papers or even, worldwide<br>
reference handbooks describe the solubility of a.i. in different solvents, thus offering a fast answer to the<br>
question (if not immediate, pointing out to the solution) of which is the most appropriate solvent for the oil phase<br>

the in situ polymerization reaction of the wall forming materials onto the water droplets, optionally<br>
adding an oil soluble aza catalyst of the type DBU when the polymerization reaction has already<br>
begun, about 5-30 minutes after the addition of the water phase to the oil phase (but necessarily if<br>
no catalyst is added in step 2)<br>
4)	raising the temperature for the curing of the microcapsules to 60 - 100°C<br>
 <br>
Adding the necessary coformulants to form a functionally acceptable agricultural formulation preferably at least<br>
two surface active materials, optionally at least an alumiosilicate-based material or material providing the same<br>
functionality of it, and all these coformulants optionally being in organic unpolar solvent(s), most preferably the<br>
same unpolar solvent(s) present in the oil phase of step 2).<br>
§17 Preferred sulfonylureas to be included in any oil phase where the RPµ are present, are: Amidosulfuron.<br>
Bensulfuron-methyl, Chlorimuron, Chlorsulfuron, Cinosulfuron, Cyclosulfamuron, Ethametsulfuron-methyl.<br>

included in this claim, optionally alkyl derivatives, dealkylated deivatives and/or salts thereof. This referes to the<br>
typical variations: thifensulfuron-ethylthifensulfuron, etc. When the sulfonylureas are in a salt form and the<br>
solubility in the desired oil solvent is not enough to reach a biological effect in the field, then it is preferred that<br>
such sulfonylurea derivative is added in the water phase and microencapsulated in RPµ.<br>
§18 The process of mixing a SC with a CS of RPµ is explained in the Example 7. We also claim a formulated<br>
agrochemical composition according claim 8 or 15 wherein, apart from a water soluble or water dispersible<br>
microencapsulated agrochemical, it is present at least a water soluble compound or oil-soluble compound<br>
dispersed into the oil phase, preferably by milling such compound(s) in a separated aliquot of the oil phase -but<br>
containing no microcapsules- and then mixing the milled compound(s) together with this aliquot to the<br>
microencapsulated fraction<br>
§19-20 Formulated agrochemical compositions of the type CS, CX, WDG, ZC, CS-EC, OD (oil dispersion)<br>
according the invention may have at least a water solube microencapsulated agrochemical selected from the<br>
group: glyphosate, glufosinate, glufosinate, paraquat, diquat, chlormequat, 2,4-D, -both in any form, preferably<br>
in salt form- an the oil phase contains diflufenican or at least an aryoxyphenoxypropionate preferably<br>
Quizalofop-P-ethyl or propaquizafop-ethyl or fenoxaprop-P-ethyl. Also formulations of sulfonylureas in the<br>
claimed types [CS, CX, WDG, ZC, CS-EC, OD] are particularly preferred, in so far RPµ are present, and of this<br>
nicosulfuron is of great interest and proven to be at least 20% times more stable to hydrolysis than current<br>
commercial formulations, when embodied in a CX being microencapsulated in NPµ and combined with<br>
sulfosate.<br>
§21 "Quat" herbicides, preferably chosen from chloride or bromide- paraquat, diquat, chlormequat. are object of<br>
this invention, in so far microencapsulation offers a solution to its high toxicity, combined with an oil phase<br>
contains a sulfonylurea o sulfonamide herbicide.<br>
 <br>
§22 Glufosinate and lactofen is a very effective combination proven to act synergistically in our greenhouse tests<br>
(results not shown).<br>
§23 A formulated agrochemical composition of the type water dispersable granules containing microcapsules<br>
according claim 1 or 2 is of high interest, since this solid flowable compositions are very preferred by the farmers<br>
and reduce transport costs of solvents. A picture of this type of formulation is shown in Figure 3<br>
§24 A formulated agrochemical composition of the type ZC (suspension concentrate plus capsule suspension)<br>
containing microcapsules according claim 1 or 2 is shown in Figure 4.<br>
§25 A formulated agrochemical composition consisting of a combination of an emulsion concentrate plus<br>
capsule suspension, containing microcapsules according claim 1 or 2 is one of the preferred embodiments for its<br>
easiness of preparation with very interchangeable Adjustment Mixtures (see Example 1).<br>
§26-35 This invention provides for the first time an enabling disclosure of agrochemical formulations<br>
characterized in that they contain.<br>
a)	Reverse phase microcapsules containing a watery core wherein at least water soluble active<br>
ingredient is present<br>
b)	Normal phase microcapsules containing a oily core wherein at least an oily soluble active<br>
ingredient is present<br>
Is described herein for the first time. Since the object of this invention is to find new ways to use in agriculture<br>
water-soluble agrochemicals, we do not restrict the claim to the RPµ explicitly shown in claim 1 or in process 8.<br>
Rather, this revolutionary type of formulation may be used with any kind of RPµ -present or future- in so far the<br>
size and performance is acceptable. Of course, as preferred embodiment of this formulation is that where our<br>
RPµ are used, and also where the NPµ wall is created as in Example 5, with mixed polyurea-glycoluril wall<br>
Formulations of mixed microcapules are those having as continuous phase water oil, WDG. SC-RPµ-NPµ, EC-<br>
RPµ-NPµ, RPµ-NPµ in the form of oil dispersion -wherein in the oil dispersion is present a further active<br>
ingredient-, or equally, as emulsion concentrate where in the oil it is present a further active ingredient.<br>
§35 The mixed NPµ+RPµ are specially suitable for combining different classes of agrochemicals, namely, the<br>
a.i. are combined to have different biological effects, preferably the combination of: fungicides + herbicides<br>
fungicides + insecticides, insecticides + herbicides, insecticides + plant growth regulators, insecticides +<br>
semiochemicals, provided that in the case of existing the two different microcapsules according claim 26 a) and<br>
b), each type of microcapsule contains a biologically active different material (in the sense of the target living<br>
organisms to control).<br>

a.i. per Hectare when applied in the field, preferably at the same concentrations as the ones used in state of the<br>
art non-microencapsulated or microencapsulated commercial products containing such a.i.<br>
The reader will immediately recognize that the change of a certain salt form of the water soluble a.i. is irrelevant<br>
e.g., the use of glyphosate isopropylammonium can be easily replaced by glyphosate ammonium, or any other<br>
salt or organic derivative -in so far the solubility properties are not tremendously changed.-e.g., for a maximum<br>
solubility of 40% in water a change to a solubility of 1%- and the concentration adjusted to match the same<br>
content in free glyphosate acid form. This also applies similarly to other oil soluble a.i., e.g Quizalofop-P-ethyl<br>
can be easily replaced by Quizalofop-ethyl (a racemic mixture), metsulfuron-methyl can be replaced by<br>
metsulfuron, propaquizafop-ethyl can be replaced by propaquizafop, as so on. There is nothing in this invention<br>
that prevents such elementary changes.<br>
All this formulations have been realized, although for reasons of simplicity, only the complete details of<br>
the formulation of some of them are disclosed. However, with the examples provided, all formulations mentioned<br>
are implicitly disclosed in a fully enabling disclosure, since the only that the skilled in the art needs to do is just to<br>
replace the content in active ingredient from one to another.<br>
The following examples show how the invention is easily embodied with surprising results regarding the<br>
easiness of the process and the stability and performance achieved by the claimed formulations<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
A capsule suspension formulation of the water soluble herbicide glyphosate in its isopropylamine salt form (in<br>
short, G-IPA), was performed as follows (later also, a mixed formulation with the water-insoluble herbicide<br>
diflufenican).<br>
A water phase containing the G-IPA and an oil phase were made, and warmed at 50 'C, in separate vessels<br>
according to:<br>

2)	The water phase is transferred (poured) slowly but continuously to the oil phase during 1 minute into the<br>
oil phase, under continuous agitation with an Ultraturrax L4 mixer for 10 minutes.<br>
3)	Before the conclusion of the 10 minute period mentioned above, and after finalization of the addition of<br>
the water phase to the oil phase, a solution in Solvesso 200 (at 10%) of {1,8-}Diazabicyclo[5 4 0]undec<br>
7-ene [in short, DBU] is added to the emulsified solution -0.15% over total percentage- (preferably 1<br>
minute after emulsification begins, namely, after total addition of the water phase)<br>
4)	After the period of 10 minutes, the reactor vessel is left at 60°C and with gentle agitation (with an anchor<br>
type stirrer at 25 rpm) for a period of 2 hours (curing of microcapsules). After this period of curing, we<br>
have a Concentrated Glyphosate CS formulation [in short, C.G.-CS]. At this time we obtain<br>
microcapsules with a median size of 1.8 µm. Oil Phase<br>
5)	At this point we can choose to have a Glyphosate CS 250 g/L formulation [point 5.1)] or we can combine<br>
the microcapsules with an oil phase containing another active ingredient [point 5.2)] in the form of<br>
Emulsion Concentrate (EC) like a Mixed formulation Glyphosate 200 g/L CS and diflufenican 80 g/L EC.<br>
 <br>
5.1)	Although at this moment, after the curing, the formulation is perfectly microencapsulated and stable for the<br>
purposes of using the formulation as a ready to use agrochemical formulation, an Adjustment Mixture A [in<br>
short, A.F.-A] is added to the capsule suspension resulting from point 4) [the C G.-CS] in a ratio A.F.-A<br>

5.2)	Alternatively the C.G.-CS may be mixed with the following Adjustment Mixture B [A.F.-B] {instead of<br>

(meaning that the water phase has been effectively retained inside the microcapsules).<br>
Storage Stability Tests.<br>
Both formulations were submitted to accelerated heat stability tests (at 54"C for 2 weeks). None of the two<br>
formulations showed any water release from the microcapsules, either water/oil separation or emulsion.<br>
Microscopic observation of the microcapsules showed a complete integrity. Also, presence of unencapsulated<br>
material -water soluble a.i.- was below 0.1%.<br>
The chemical degradation of glyphosate and diflufenican was not statistically significant (fresh samples of both<br>
formulations 5.1) and 5.2) compared with aged samples did not presented differences in the Student's t-test.<br>
either with pure analytical standard solutions at the same concentration of the a.i.) These tests were performed<br>
with HPLC and standard methods of analysis under Good Laboratory Practice conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
RPµ High loaded formulation of glyphosate ammonium + EC halosulfuron<br>
A high loaded formulation (E2.1) of glyphosate ammonium together with the sulfonylurea herbicide halosulfuron.<br>
was prepared according the present invention, and compared with other two prior art methods of<br>
microencapsulation.<br>
The composition is identical to Example 1 but replacing:<br>
-in the water phase: glyphosate isopropylammonium by glyphosate ammonium, and increasing its content to 65<br>
parts (the rest oil phase remaining with the original parts).<br>
-in the oil phase: the content of diflufenican wholly by halosulfuron<br>
and that the ratio A.F.-A / C.G.-CS instead of being 22.5 / 77.5 is now 10/90.<br>
The formulation showed perfectly stable microcapsules (mean diameter = 1.5 µrn) at 54"C for two weeks, with<br>
0.05% degradation of glyphosate and 5.12% degradation of halosulfuron. The halosulfuron oil concentrate<br>
(E2.2) showed a degradation of 4.82%, meaning that no increased degradation of halosulfuron was due to the<br>
process or the mixed formulation.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
RPµ + EC mixed formulation of 2,4-0 sodium and lactofen<br>
A formulation (E3.1) of RPµ of 2,4-D sodium plus lactofen (E3.2) was made, to yield an emulsifiable concentrate<br>
containing microcapsules of 2,4-D sodium and solubilized lactofen.<br>
The composition followed that explained in Example 1, where the glyphosate was substituted by 2:4-D (20% in<br>
water) and the diflufenican was substituted by lactofen (E3.3).<br>
An Adjustment Mixture AM-EC, in order to create an emulsion concentrate of the formed 2.4-D+lactofen<br>
formulation was used, consisting in castor oil 20 mols ethoxylated : calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate emulsifier<br>
(Calsogen CA): Genapol LA at the ratio 50 : 10 : 40. This AM-EC was added (200 g) to the E3.3<br>
This CS-EC formulation (E3.4) was emulsified in water at a concentration of 5% of the formulation, showing no<br>
oil and cream separation at time 30 minutes, and 1 ml cream at 2 hours.<br>
 <br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
WDG-RPµ microcapsules of sulfosate ammonium<br>
A formulation according Example E1.1, using sulfosate ammonium (20% in water) as a.i instead of glyphosate<br>
was made. At the end of the microencapsulation, a 10% (with respect total weight of formed E1.1) of sodium<br>
dioctylsulfosuccinate wetter was added and also 1% of sodium cresolformaldehyde condendation dispersant.<br>
To this amount, an Adjustemt Mixture AM-DRPµ for allowing the spray dry process was used, consisting in 48%<br>
of cyclodextrin, 2% of Arbocel™, 25% CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) and 25% dextrin. 30% over the 1000 g<br>
(300 g) of this mixture was added directly to the spray chamber, in order the oil is adsorbed in such material<br>
The addition of further AM-DRPµ was done as needed (in this process only one batch was made, and no further<br>
addition of adsorbing materials was needed, however, at industrial scale, the retirement of already flowable<br>
microcapsules may need further additions of AM-DRPµ, in the conventional way for the skilled in spray drying<br>
technicial would do for similar processes). After spray drying at a product temperature of 50 "C, it was obtained<br>
a flowable powder of dispersable microcapsules of sulfosate ammonium (water fispersable granules) The wet<br>
sieving residue calculated with a sieve of 250 urn was 0.85 %, having a dispersibility of 85% and a suspensibility<br>
of 92%.<br>

A formulated RPµ (E5.2) of acifluorfen sodium was performed as in Example 1, substituting the glyphosate<br>
ammonium at 60 % in water by acifluorfen sodium at 44% in water<br>
Now, in the step of mixing both types of formulations, it must be taken into account:<br>
The addition to the water phase of the E5.2 of the oil phase of the finished E5.1, needs the presence of<br>
an emulsifier with HLB 7-14, preferably 9-10, or at least, that the total HLB of the emulsifiers would<br>
equate a value of 9-10. This is done in this example adding a castor oil ethoxylathe 64 mols to the water<br>
phase of E5.2, in a 10% over total weight of E5.2.<br>
The emulsification is preferably made oil in water, namely the RPµ added to the NPµ A ratio of RPµ to<br>
NPµ of 40 to 60 is used in this example. Emulsification is done adding the RPµ as obtained in E5.2 to<br>
the E5.1 plus the mentioned surfactant with high HLB (over 7), under continuous agitation with anchor<br>
type stirrer (at about 100-1000 rpm) -this requiring that the configuration of the stirrer and the speed do<br>
not damage the microcapsules-.<br>
This way we have obtained the RPµ + NPµ, but to avoid storage stability problems, it is recommended<br>
the addition of some viscosity modifiers to the water phase. In this example we use a mixture of Keltrol<br>
and Pangel at 1:1, in a total amount of 3% over total weight up to the moment of that viscosity modifier<br>
addition.<br>
Finally, we have obtained, for the first time a CX-w formulation (combined capsule suspension of RPµ and NPµ<br>
wherein we have acifluorfen sodium microencapsulated in a core of water and flurochloridone<br>
microencapsulated in a core of oil, and both types of microcapsules having a continuous phase of water<br>
surrounding them.<br>
The mean size of the combined microcapsules was measured with a laser Mastersizer™, with a result of 2.9 µrn<br>
and a percentile 90 of 5.3 µrn. This represents an enormous degree of homogeneicity. and moreover a very<br>
small size over the prior art RPµ. Emulsification properties were tested according FAO specifications showing no<br>
oil separation at 30 minutes and after 2 hours, and full reemulsification was shown after 24 hours. The<br>
formulation did not presented any phase separation after 2 weeks at 40 °C.<br>
No detection of degradaded of any of the a.i. was possible (below limits of detection / analytical error)<br>
Unencapsulated material was below 0.5% for the acifluorfen sodium and below 0.01% for flurochloridone.<br>
In Figure 4 a microphotograph is shown with the resulting final formulation. The RPµ are slightly bigger and they<br>
can be differentiated from the NPµ in that the former have a reddish core and the NPµ have a greenish solid<br>
color<br>
 <br>
It can be appreciated that the wall forming materials for the NPµ and the RPµ are chemically of the same nature<br>
(glycolurils+isocyanates) a surprising result that facilitates the logistic and handling operations in the formulation<br>
plant.<br>
FURTHER PROCESSING<br>
The resulting formulation of the CX-w was processed in order to obtain WDG of mixed microcapsules<br>
To 1 kg of the resulting CX-w, an Adjustemt Mixture AM-DRPµ for allowing the spray dry process was used,<br>
consisting in 50% of cyclodextrins, 25% sepiolite and 25% CMC (carboxymethylcellulose), 30% over the 1000 g<br>
(300 g) of this mixture was added directly to the spray chamber, in order the oil is adsorbed in such matenai.<br>
The addition of further AM-DRPµ was done as needed (in this process only one batch was made, and no further<br>
addition of adsorbing materials was needed, however, at industrial scale, the retirement of already flowable<br>
microcapsules may need further additions of AM-DRPµ, in the conventional way for the skilled in spray drying<br>
technicial would do for similar processes). After spray drying at a product temperature of 63 CC, it was obtained<br>
a flowable powder of dispersable microcapsules, namely WDG of CX microcapsules.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
CX formulation (mixed NPµ and RPµ) of ioxynil sodium and metsulfuron-methyl.<br>
Microcapsules of the type RPµ were done (E6.1) according the following formula and process as in Example 1<br>
E61	Parts<br>

Microcapsules of the type NPµ were done according those in Example 5, but substituting the flurochlondone bv<br>
metsulfuron-methyl.<br>
To the difference of Example 6, here it is added the NPµ to the RPµ. For this we need to proceed as above<br>
while inverting the need of the HLB of the surfactant, this time in the range 1-6, preferably about 2-3 (in any case<br>
lower than 7). A 10 % presence of surfactant is enough to produce a good emulsion. Atlox® LP-6 is used in this<br>
example at 12%, before emulsification.<br>
This time, due to the increased viscosity of Solvesso the emulsion was stable even without addition of viscosity<br>
modifier, although is recommended any viscosity modifier for the outer oil phase.<br>
 <br>
Finally, we have obtained, for the first time a CX-o formulation (combined capsule suspension of RPµ and NPµ)<br>
wherein we have ioxynil sodium, microencapsulated in a core of water, and metsulfuron microencapsulated in a<br>
core of oil, and both types of microcapsules having a continuous phase of water surrounding them.<br>
The best advantage of this formulation is that the very sensitive to degradation sulfonylurea metsulfuron-methyi<br>
degraded only 3.1% in 2 weeks at 54 °C compared with commercial products containing it wherein a range from<br>
10% till 34% has been observed in our lab at the same time and temperature conditions. Further an oi:<br>
suspension of metsulfuron-methyi, according Adjustment Mixture B of Example 1 (substituting diflufenican by<br>
metsulfuron-methyi) and adding 5% of urea in respect total oil suspension, showed degradation of 45% in 2<br>
weeks at 54 °C. This demonstrates undoubtfully that degradation of metsulfuron-methyi is almost completely<br>
inhibited by virtue of microencapsulating it, thus providing this invention a way to combine water soluble<br>
agrochemicals with labile sulfonylureas, very prone to degradation in water phase or even oil phase The space<br>
constriction of the tiny microcapsules (1.1 urn mean diameter) limits the reactivity of the sulfonylureas, and the<br>
accumulation of any by-products that balance the equilibrium to the original sulfonylurea undegraded, makes<br>
this invention extremely useful for any sulfonylurea, since the degradation inhibition seen with metsulfuron-<br>
methyi, has been equally observed with tribenuron-methyl (results and process not shown) and there is no<br>
rationale into thinking that this protective effect cannot be extended to all sulfonylureas, that are quite similar in<br>
chemical structure. Moreover, the experiment of tribenuron-methyl was done with a emulsification into the water<br>
phase as in Example 6 (namely, obtaining a CX-w), meaning that the existence of an oil or a water phase<br>
outside of the microcapsule is irrelevant for what happens inside the microcapsule (logically). Unencapsulated<br>
material was below 0.1%. Emulsification properties were tested according FAO specifications showing no oil<br>
separation at 30 minutes and after 2 hours, and full reemulsification was shown after 24 hours The formulation<br>
did not presented any phase separation after 2 weeks at 40 °C.<br>

In these series of tests, it was investigated the effects of the wall forming materials in the size of the<br>
microcapsules.<br>
The better result (most homogeneous microcapsules with the smaller diameter) was obtained by E8 1, well<br>
distant from the results of all other tests.<br>
The smaller the diameter is, the faster is the release, that for most herbicides is highly desired, since the farmer<br>
desires to obtain controlling results as soon as possible. However, higher sizes may. in certain conditions be<br>
more interesting, since this provides a longer action, in general.<br>
For the most common and most appreciated characteristics of the microcapsules for agriculture (small particle<br>
size) the ones that contain glycoluril resins show much better results. Of these, those combined with he<br>
isocyanate TMXDI provide the most homogeneous and sharpened distribution of sizes<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
In all this formulations, we have obtained convenient microcapsules with novel formulas, while not keeping free<br>
the water phase from all the components but the a.i. We can perform this with Glyphosate isopropylammonium<br>
salt and 2,4-D sodium, since none of the components added in the water phase react with the a.i. While the<br>
preferred embodiments of this invention are those that keep the water phase only for the active ingredient(s),<br>
this does not mean that other advantages of the invention can be used when adding wall forming materials in<br>
the water phase (in this case, the exactly same Adjustment Mixture A of Example 1 has been used to obtain<br>
perfectly stable formulations of microcapsules, a logistical advantage).<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Water Dispersable Granules of thifensulfuron-methyl and RPµ containing glyphosate ammonium.<br>
A formulation (water based) according Example 5 was made, with the substitution of flurocloridone by<br>
thifensulfuron-methyl and acifluorfen sodium by glyphosate ammonium (E10.1). At the end of the process, in<br>
order to allow the spray-dry process, it was added 10% (with respect total weight of formed E10.1) of sodium<br>
 <br>
dioctylsulfosuccinate wetter was added and also 1% of sodium stearic methyl taunde dispersant To this<br>
amount, an Adjustemt Mixture AM-DRPµ for allowing the spray dry process was used, consisting in 48% of<br>
cyclodextrin. 2% of Arbocel™, 25% CMC (carboxymethylcellulose) and 25% dextrin. 30% over the 1000 g (300<br>
g) of this mixture was added directly to the spray chamber and then the product was sprayed dried, yielding<br>
WDG as shown in Figure 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
A series of unsuccessful tests are represented by the following formulas. The resulting microencapsulated<br>
products did not satisfied the minimum requirements for a homogeneous distributed particle size or the stability<br>
was poor (separation of oil from water after 4 days at 54°C). In most cases, the combination of wall forming<br>
materials produced a very fast reaction in an uncontrollable way.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
In CEI, it was found 10% of unencapsulated Glyphosate isopropylammonium. Further, rests of formaldehyde<br>
were detectable at 0.008%, meanining that the water soluble resin could not react in full, or at least total<br>
consumption of toxic formaldehyde was not achieved.<br>
The presence of formaldehyde in all the Examples 1-10 of this invention was tested and we could not detect any<br>
residual presence of isocyanates (via derivatization and HPLC-UV analysis) (0.0001% limit of detection) either<br>
from formaldehyde (0.001% limit of detection).<br>

This invention relates to microcapsules and processes of microencapsulation of water soluble or water dispersible compounds by reverse-phase microencapsulation, referred to agrochemicals<br>
but not as a limiting feature, and how to combine them with other oil soluble or oil dispersible compounds in suitable formulations for agriculture, in a industrially viable process that yields tiny microcapsules (
overall good performance of the formulation. Further, multiple combinations of this reverse-phase microcapsules are disclosed, being specially notorious the combination with normal-phase microcapsules in order to create a Capsule Mixed Suspension (CX) where an outer oil -or<br>
alternatively water- phase contains microcapsules of two types: those with a core of water -and actives dissolved or dispersed therein- and those with a core of oil -and actives dissolved or dispersed therein-. Water Dispersable Granules (WDG) and Emulsion Concentrates (EC) and suspension concentrates (SC) combinations with the reverse phase microcapsules are also successfully performed, providing a novel concept of combinations of oil soluble with water soluble microencapsulated active ingredients.</td>
