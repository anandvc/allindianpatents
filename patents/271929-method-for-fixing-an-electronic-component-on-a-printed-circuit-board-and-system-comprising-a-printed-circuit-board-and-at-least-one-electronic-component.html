				<td>METHOD FOR FIXING AN ELECTRONIC COMPONENT ON A PRINTED<br>
CIRCUIT BOARD AND SYSTEM COMPRISING A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD<br>
AND AT LEAST ONE ELECTRONIC COMPONENT<br>
The present invention relates to a process for attaching or<br>
fixing an electronic component on a circuit board and/or<br>
contacting the electronic component with the circuit board,<br>
as well as a process for producing an intermediate layer<br>
for disentangling contact or connection sites of an<br>
electronic component from contact or connection surfaces of<br>
a circuit board. The present invention further relates to a<br>
system including a circuit board and at least one<br>
electronic component.<br>
Electronic components to be applied on circuit boards have<br>
become increasingly complex, which has, above all, resulted<br>
in an increase of the required number of connections to the<br>
circuit board, which has in turn led to a reduction of the<br>
distances between individual or neighboring connections<br>
such as, for instance, conductive pins with an unchanged<br>
size of the electronic component. In this connection,<br>
printed circuit board manufacturers started to perform<br>
disentanglements of such components, or individual<br>
components, via conductive passages or microvias through<br>
several circuit board layers in so-called high-density<br>
interconnects or HDI boards or printed boards.<br>
With a further increase in the complexity of electronic<br>
components and the thus involved increase in the number of<br>
connections to a circuit board, and/or a further reduction<br>
of the dimensions of such electronic components, which will<br>
likewise lead to reduced distances between neighboring<br>
connections, a large increase in the number of circuit<br><br>
board layers is expected for the necessary disentanglement.<br>
Moreover, an increase in the complexity of such an<br>
electronic component together with reduced mutual distances<br>
linked with enhanced connections will minimize the options<br>
for realizing or arranging conductive tracks or conductive<br>
structures between individual connections, or render an<br>
arrangement impossible at all, which will immediately call<br>
for a further increase in the number of necessary circuit<br>
board layers. Additional layers of such a circuit board<br>
will, however, result in an increased thickness of the<br>
circuit board and, moreover, in increased production costs.<br>
A way of reducing the number of circuit boards is by using<br>
very fine or ultra-fine conductive structures, wherein,<br>
however, for the time being, even with the possible<br>
availability of processes for producing such fine or ultra-<br>
fine conductive structures, it is to be anticipated that<br>
the production of multilayer circuit boards including such<br>
ultra-fine conductive structures in usual production<br>
formats of high-density interconnects, such as, e.g., 18 x<br>
24 inch, does not enable the orientation of circuit board<br>
layers with sufficient precision in order to, for instance,<br>
provide conductive connections between individual board<br>
layers where such ultra-fine conductive tracks or<br>
conductive structures are provided.<br>
From WO 01/43190 Al there has become known a liquid crystal<br>
display, wherein a substrate having connecting or contact<br>
surfaces is coupled or connected with an electronic<br>
component by using an intermediate device.<br>
From US 2005/0133891 Al there has become known a system<br>
consisting of a circuit board or printed circuit board and<br><br>
an electronic component, wherein the electronic component<br>
is coupled with the circuit board or the substrate via<br>
intermediate connecting locations. Moreover, from US<br>
6,429,534 Bl there can be taken a frame-like element for<br>
coupling a circuit board and an electronic component to be<br>
fixed on the circuit board, wherein the frame-like element<br>
surrounds the electronic component being fixed on the<br>
circuit board and a coupling is provided between the<br>
connecting locations or sites of the electronic component<br>
facing away from the circuit board and respective<br>
connecting or contact surfaces of the circuit board by wire<br>
connections, which are provided between the connecting or<br>
contact surfaces of the electronic component and respective<br>
wiring paths or tracks on the frame-like element on the one<br>
side and between the wiring paths on the frame-like element<br>
and the respective contact surfaces of the circuit board on<br>
the other hand, so that much effort is necessary for<br>
coupling the connecting areas of the electronic component<br>
with respective or dedicated connecting areas of the<br>
circuit board by arranging a very large number of wire<br>
connections.<br>
Based on a process of the initially defined kind as well as<br>
a system of the initially defined kind, the present<br>
invention, therefore, aims to avoid the above-mentioned<br>
problems with regard to the use of electronic components of<br>
increased complexity and/or reduced size, and hence the<br>
reduction of the small mutual distances between connections<br>
to the circuit board, by a substantially unchanged circuit<br>
board design and, in particular, to enable the<br>
disentanglement of such highly complex components of, in<br>
particular, small dimensions while avoiding additionally<br>
required circuit board layers.<br><br>
To achieve the above-mentioned objects, a process for<br>
attaching or fixing an electronic component on a circuit<br>
board and/or contacting the electronic component with the<br>
circuit board is essentially characterized by the steps of:<br>
-	providing the circuit board with a plurality of contact<br>
or connection surfaces;<br>
-	providing the electronic component with a number of<br>
contact or connection sites corresponding to the plurality<br>
of contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board, at<br>
mutual distances reduced relative to the distances of the<br>
contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board; and<br>
-	arranging or forming between the contact or connection<br>
surfaces of the circuit board and the contact or connection<br>
sites of the electronic component at least one intermediate<br>
layer for disentangling the contact or connection sites of<br>
the electronic component.<br>
Due to the fact that according to the invention, after<br>
having provided the circuit board or printed circuit board<br>
with a plurality of contact or connection surfaces and the<br>
electronic component with a corresponding number of contact<br>
or connection sites, an or at least one intermediate layer<br>
for disentangling the contact or connection sites of the<br>
electronic component is arranged or formed between the<br>
contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board and the<br>
associated contact or connection sites of the electronic<br>
component, it has become feasible to couple with, or attach<br>
to, the circuit board, or contact the latter with, an<br>
electronic component comprising an optionally higher<br>
complexity and, consequently, a larger number of<br>
connections to the circuit board at simultaneously reduced<br>
distances between the individual connections, and/or an<br><br>
electronic component having reduced dimensions, without<br>
increasing the number of circuit board layers for the<br>
disentanglement between the connection sites of the<br>
electronic component and the connection sites or surfaces<br>
of the circuit board. The intermediate layer provided<br>
according to the invention may have a thickness reduced<br>
relative to the thickness of a circuit board layer,<br>
particularly of the dielectric layer or film, such that a<br>
negligible increase in the thickness of the entire circuit<br>
board will do, particularly in consideration of the fact<br>
that a circuit board of this type would usually comprise a<br>
plurality of, for instance, more than 4 and, in particular,<br>
more than 6 circuit board layers, while, at the same time,<br>
enabling the safe disentanglement in a preferably single<br>
layer or ply of the intermediate layer. If highly complex<br>
components including extremely large numbers of contact or<br>
connection sites are employed, more than one intermediate<br>
layer including the respective feedthroughs may be<br>
provided, wherein, however, even with the provision of more<br>
than one intermediate layer, unalteredly great advantages<br>
relative to the provision of an elevated number of<br>
additional board layers will be attainable, bearing in mind<br>
the strongly reduced thickness as compared to conventional<br>
circuit boards and the simplified structuring of the<br>
circuit board.<br>
It is, thus, feasible to resort to presently available<br>
techniques for forming circuit boards having a plurality of<br>
circuit board layers, in particular when taking into<br>
account the precision requirements for the alignment of<br>
individual subregions of such circuit board layers, while<br>
the appropriate, very fine or ultra-fine conductive tracks<br>
or structures may be provided in the region of the<br><br>
intermediate layer for disentanglement, while accordingly-<br>
large partial regions or contact zones may be provided on<br>
the intermediate layer for the respective contacting or<br>
connection of the contact or connection sites of the<br>
electronic component as well as the connection or contact<br>
surfaces of the circuit boards.<br>
As already indicated above, it will do for disentanglement<br>
to use an intermediate layer having a simplified structure<br>
as compared to usual circuit board layers, it being<br>
preferably proposed in this respect that the intermediate<br>
layer is formed with conductive tracks or structures<br>
between contact zones corresponding to the contact or<br>
connection sites of the electronic component and<br>
corresponding to the contact or connection surfaces of the<br>
circuit board. Since the intermediate layer is merely<br>
formed with conductive tracks or structures between contact<br>
zones corresponding to the contact or connection sites of<br>
the electronic component and corresponding to the contact<br>
or connection surfaces of the circuit board, the<br>
arrangement or formation of very fine or ultra-fine<br>
conductive tracks or structures may be provided, which can,<br>
for instance, be formed by known techniques on or in the<br>
intermediate layer such that the mutual distances of the<br>
connections of such components, which are reduced when<br>
using complex components, do not constitute any restriction<br>
in view of the possibility of realizing or providing<br>
conductive tracks in the intermediate layer.<br>
In order to ensure reliable contacting between the<br>
electronic component and the intermediate layer for<br>
disentanglement, it is proposed according to a preferred<br>
embodiment that contacting between the contact or<br><br>
connection sites of the electronic component and the<br>
intermediate layer is realized via contacts of the<br>
electronic component.<br>
According to a modified embodiment, it is preferably-<br>
proposed by the invention that contact or connection sites<br>
of the electronic component are directly contacted with<br>
contact zones of the intermediate layer, thus enabling a<br>
further reduction of costs for the attachment of the<br>
electronic component to the circuit board, and also an<br>
improved connection or fixation of electronic components on<br>
a circuit board while interposing the intermediate layer<br>
for disentanglement, by a reduction of connections, for<br>
instance welds or bonds.<br>
According to a further preferred embodiment, it is proposed<br>
that the intermediate layer is merely formed in the region<br>
of the contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board<br>
as well as the contact or connection sites of the<br>
electronic component, so that accordingly reduced material<br>
expenditures will be involved in the formation of the<br>
intermediate layer, since the latter merely need be<br>
provided in the region of the attachment of the or an<br>
electronic component on the circuit board while, at the<br>
same time, taking into account the increased distances<br>
between the individual contact or connection surfaces of<br>
the circuit board relative to the distances of the contact<br>
or connection sites of the electronic component.<br>
For a further cost reduction and/or formation of a compact<br>
overall structure, in particular when assembling the<br>
electronic component and the circuit board, it is proposed<br>
according to a further preferred embodiment that the<br><br>
electronic component is attached on the circuit board with<br>
contact or connection surfaces oriented away from the<br>
circuit board, and is overlaid by the intermediate layer<br>
for disentanglement and connection to the contact or<br>
connection surfaces of the circuit board. Thus, in addition<br>
to offering the chance of disentanglement via the<br>
intermediate layer having an extremely small thickness,<br>
also a supporting function for the electronic component<br>
will be fulfilled such that an additional carrier substrate<br>
for the electronic component will be obviated so as to not<br>
only enable a reduction of the size of the overall system<br>
comprised of the circuit board and the at least one<br>
electronic component, but also a reduction of the overall<br>
costs.<br>
To achieve the objects mentioned in the beginning, a<br>
process for producing an intermediate layer for<br>
disentangling contact or connection sites of an electronic<br>
component from contact or connection surfaces of a circuit<br>
board is, moreover, essentially characterized by the steps<br>
of:<br>
-	providing the circuit board with a plurality of contact<br>
or connection surfaces;<br>
-	forming a base material of the intermediate layer at<br>
least in the region of the contact or connection surfaces<br>
of the circuit board;<br>
structuring the intermediate layer to form conductive<br>
tracks or structures and contact sites for contacting with<br>
contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board and<br>
with contact or connection sites of an electronic component<br>
to be attached on the circuit board.<br><br>
As already pointed out above, it is feasible in a simple<br>
manner, after having provided the circuit board with a<br>
plurality of contact or connection sites, to make the at<br>
least one intermediate layer for disentanglement available<br>
for an electronic component to be subsequently attached.<br>
For a reliable formation of the intermediate layer<br>
comprising, in particular, very fine or ultra-fine<br>
conductive tracks or structures, it is, moreover, proposed<br>
that the structuring of the intermediate layer is performed<br>
by subtractive techniques, semi-additive techniques,<br>
additive techniques and/or embossing techniques or laser<br>
structuring techniques known per se, as in correspondence<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the process for producing<br>
the intermediate layer for disentanglement according to the<br>
invention.<br>
For receiving, or fulfilling the function of a support for,<br>
an electronic component to be subsequently attached to the<br>
circuit board upon interposition of the intermediate layer<br>
for disentanglement, it is proposed according to a further<br>
preferred embodiment that, after the structuring of the<br>
intermediate layer, an additional support layer for the<br>
attachment or contacting of the electronic component is<br>
applied on the intermediate layer for disentanglement and<br>
provided with contacts for the electronic component.<br>
As already mentioned above, it may preferably be provided<br>
according to the invention, particularly in consideration<br>
of the fact that the intermediate layer for disentanglement<br>
merely contains very fine or ultra-fine conductive tracks<br>
or structures in addition to the contact zones to be<br>
provided for contacting with the electronic component as<br><br>
well as the circuit board, that the intermediate layer is<br>
formed with a thickness reduced- relative to the thickness<br>
of a circuit board layer.<br>
In this connection, it is proposed according to a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment that the thickness of the<br>
intermediate layer is selected to be less than half, in<br>
particular less than a third, of the thickness of a circuit<br>
board layer. It is, thus, feasible to do, for instance,<br>
with intermediate layers having dielectric film thicknesses<br>
of below, e.g. 35 to 40 μm, in particular down to 10 μm or<br>
less, while a typical dielectric film thickness of an HDI<br>
circuit board amounts to at least 60 μm, e.g. more than 80<br>
μm.<br>
For the disentanglement of the junction, or contact or<br>
connection sites of the electronic component, very fine or<br>
ultra-fine conductive structures will do in the<br>
intermediate layer, wherein it is proposed in this respect<br>
according to a further preferred embodiment that the<br>
intermediate layer is provided with conductive tracks or<br>
conductive structures whose widths are selected to be less<br>
than 50 μm, in particular less than 30 μm.<br>
As already indicated above, it is feasible according to a<br>
further preferred embodiment, in particular with a view to<br>
further reducing costs and simplifying the formation and<br>
attachment of the electronic component, that the<br>
intermediate layer is used as a support and/or enclosure<br>
for the electronic component.<br>
To achieve the initially mentioned objects, a system<br>
including a circuit board and at least one electronic<br><br>
component, moreover, is essentially characterized in that<br>
at least one intermediate layer for the disentanglement of<br>
contact or connection sites of the electronic component<br>
from contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board is<br>
arranged or formed between the contact or connection sites<br>
of the electronic component and the contact or connection<br>
surfaces of the circuit board, and that the contact or<br>
connection sites of the electronic component comprise<br>
mutual distances reduced relative to the contact or<br>
connection sites of the circuit board. It is, thus,<br>
feasible to ensure disentanglement merely by providing at<br>
least one intermediate layer having a comparatively small<br>
thickness, said intermediate layer being preferably<br>
provided or providable merely partially in the region of<br>
the contact or connection surfaces of the circuit board and<br>
of the contact or connection sites of the electronic<br>
component to be connected therewith, as already indicated<br>
above.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, it is proposed in this<br>
respect that the intermediate layer is formed with<br>
conductive tracks or structures between contact zones<br>
corresponding to the contact or connection sites of the<br>
electronic component and corresponding to the contact or<br>
connection surfaces of the circuit board.<br>
To simplify the attachment and contacting of the electronic<br>
component, it is, moreover, proposed that an additional<br>
support layer for the attachment and contacting of the<br>
electronic component is applied on the intermediate layer<br>
for disentanglement and provided with contacts for the<br>
electronic component, as in correspondence with a further<br><br>
preferred embodiment of the system according to the<br>
invention.<br>
As already indicated several times, it may preferably be<br>
provided that the intermediate layer is formed with a<br>
thickness reduced relative to the thickness of a circuit<br>
board layer, wherein it is proposed according a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment that the thickness of the<br>
intermediate layer is less than half, in particular less<br>
than a third, of the thickness of a circuit board layer.<br>
In addition, it is preferably proposed that the<br>
intermediate layer is provided with conductive tracks or<br>
conductive structures whose widths are less than 50 μm, in<br>
particular less than 30 μm.<br>
For the use of unpackaged electronic components and in<br>
order to facilitate the attachment to a circuit board and<br>
contacting with the same, it is proposed according to a<br>
further preferred embodiment that the intermediate layer is<br>
used as a support and/or enclosure for the electronic<br>
component.<br>
As already indicated several times, the intermediate layer<br>
for disentanglement according to the invention is<br>
preferably usable, in particular, in connection with a<br>
circuit board having a plurality of circuit board layers,<br>
wherein it is, moreover, proposed that the circuit board in<br>
a manner known per se is formed with a plurality of<br>
superimposed circuit board layers which are at least<br>
partially interconnected by conductive passages or<br>
microvias connecting individual circuit board layers, as in<br><br>
correspondence with a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
system according to the invention.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in more<br>
detail by way of exemplary embodiments schematically<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawing. Therein:<br>
Fig. 1 is a partial section through a system according to<br>
the invention, which is comprised of a circuit board and an<br>
electronic component attached thereto, using an<br>
intermediate layer according to the invention for<br>
disentanglement;<br>
Fig. 2 schematically illustrates individual steps for<br>
carrying out the process according to the invention for<br>
attaching an electronic component to a circuit board while<br>
forming or arranging an intermediate layer for<br>
disentanglement;<br>
Fig. 3 schematically illustrates individual process steps<br>
for forming an intermediate layer for disentanglement to be<br>
used in the process according to the invention and in the<br>
system according to the invention, respectively;<br>
Fig. 4, in an illustration similar to that of Fig. 1,<br>
depicts in detail an electronic component of a system<br>
according to the invention, on a scale reduced relative to<br>
that of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 5, in an illustration similar to that of Fig. 4,<br>
depicts a further modified embodiment of a system according<br>
to the invention, with an unpackaged electronic component<br>
being integrated;<br>
Fig. 6, in an illustration similar to those of Figs. 4 and<br>
5, depicts a further modified embodiment of a system<br>
according to the invention, with the electronic component<br>
being directly applied on the intermediate layer for<br>
disentanglement; and<br><br>
Fig. 7, in an illustration again similar to those of Figs.<br>
4	to 6, depicts a further modified embodiment of the system<br>
according to the invention, with the intermediate layer for<br>
disentanglement being applied on a component integrated in<br>
the circuit board.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically illustrates a system 1 which is<br>
comprised of a printed circuit board, in particular an HDI<br>
board 2 having a plurality of board layers, and an<br>
electronic component 3 to be contacted with, and attached<br>
to, the former with an intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement arranged between the electronic component 3<br>
and the circuit board 2.<br>
As is apparent from Fig. 1, the intermediate layer 4<br>
comprises a plurality of contact or connection zones 6<br>
corresponding to the number of contact or connection sites<br>
5	of the electronic component 3, which contact or<br>
connection zones 6 are either substantially directly<br>
coupled with contact or connection zones 7 corresponding to<br>
contact or connection surfaces 8 provided on the circuit<br>
board 2. From Fig. 1, it is apparent that the distances<br>
between neighboring contact or connection sites 5 of the<br>
electronic component 3 are smaller than the distances<br>
between neighboring contact or connection surfaces 8 of the<br>
circuit board 2 such that, for a disentanglement in the<br>
intermediate layer 4, very fine or ultra-fine conductive<br>
tracks or conductive structures are additionally included<br>
to provide connections with further contact or connection<br>
zones 7 of the intermediate layer 4, via which contacting<br>
with connection or contact surfaces 8 of the circuit board<br>
2 is subsequently effected.<br><br>
As opposed to the known prior art, where immediate<br>
contacting between the connection or contact sites or<br>
connections 5 of the electronic component 3 with the<br>
associated connection or contact surfaces 8 of the circuit<br>
board 2 is realized, optionally by providing conductive<br>
passages or microvias for the disentanglement of the<br>
connection or contact sites 5 of the highly complex<br>
electronic component 3, the configuration according to Fig.<br>
1 ensures complete disentanglement via the intermediate<br>
layer 4.<br>
In the configuration according to Fig. 1, the intermediate<br>
layer 4 for disentanglement is merely provided in the<br>
region of the contact or connection sites 5 of the<br>
electronic component 3 as well as the connection or contact<br>
surfaces 7 of the circuit board 2 such that a partial<br>
formation of the intermediate layer 4 will do.<br>
Moreover, the thickness of the intermediate layer is not<br>
represented to scale relative to the size or dimensions of<br>
both the circuit board 2 and the electronic component 3 in<br>
any of the Figures. Taking into account the very fine or<br>
ultra-fine conductive tracks or conductive structures 9,<br>
which may, for instance, have widths of less than 50 μm,<br>
e.g. about 25 μm, a thickness of the dielectric film for<br>
the intermediate layer 4 in the order of about 35 μm will<br>
do, this being less than half of the usual thickness of the<br>
dielectric film of a board layer of a circuit board 2.<br>
Moreover, thicknesses for the dielectric film of the<br>
intermediate layer 4 of up to 10 μm or therebelow are<br>
usable or applicable.<br><br>
The circuit board 2 illustrated in the Figures is,<br>
moreover, for instance, comprised of a plurality of circuit<br>
board layers, which are, however, not illustrated or<br>
indicated separately.<br>
In the embodiment represented in Fig. 1, contacting between<br>
the intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement and the<br>
connection or contact sites 5 of the component 3 is<br>
realized via conductive contacts 10, which are received or<br>
provided in a carrier layer or support structure<br>
schematically indicated by 11.<br>
Instead of the merely partial arrangement of the<br>
intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement in correspondence<br>
with the contact or connection surfaces 8 of the circuit<br>
board 2 as well as the contact or connection sites 5 of the<br>
electronic component 3, the intermediate layer 4 and, in<br>
particular, the base material of the same may be applied or<br>
provided substantially all-over the surface of the circuit<br>
board 2, the respective structuring with the contact zones<br>
6 and 7, respectively, as well as the conductive tracks 9<br>
being merely provided or formed in the region of the<br>
attachment or contacting of the or an electronic component<br>
3 on the circuit board 2.<br>
Fig. 2 schematically depicts a process sequence for<br>
producing a system 1 comprised of a circuit board and an<br>
electronic component, while using or forming an<br>
intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement.<br>
In step (a), a circuit board, in particular a HDI board 2,<br>
is provided, wherein appropriate connection or contact<br>
surfaces 8 are already formed and indicated.<br><br>
In step (b), a base material for the intermediate layer 4<br>
is applied, whereupon in step (c) the structuring of the<br>
contact or connection zones 6 and 7, respectively, as well<br>
as the conductive tracks 9 of the intermediate layer 4 is<br>
performed, an exemplary process for structuring the<br>
intermediate layer 4 being discussed below with reference<br>
to Fig. 3.<br>
Following the structuring or formation of the intermediate<br>
layer 4 for disentanglement, the application of additional<br>
plies or support layers 11 and 12 is effected in step (d),<br>
whereupon, according to step (e), the structuring and<br>
finishing of the support layers or plies 11 and 12 is<br>
carried out, for instance by providing contacts 10.<br>
Finally, in step (f), the electronic component 3 is coupled<br>
or connected to the intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement, and subsequently with the circuit board 2,<br>
via the connection or contact sites 5, while interposing<br>
contacts 10.<br>
Fig. 3 schematically illustrates the partial steps of a<br>
process for structuring or forming an intermediate layer 4,<br>
using, for instance, an embossing technique known per se.<br>
It should further be noted that, for the formation or<br>
structuring of the intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement, structuring is merely performed on just<br>
one side as opposed to the double-sided structuring of an<br>
extremely fine conductor structure generally indicated in<br>
Fig. 3.<br><br>
In step (a) according to Fig. 3, embossing of the<br>
intermediate layer 4 is carried out using, for instance, an<br>
embossing tool 13 to emboss a relief structure on a thermo-<br>
plastic foil.<br>
In step (b), possibly remaining residual materials are, for<br>
instance, removed by reactive ion etching in order to<br>
enable the production of throughgoing holes or microvias<br>
14, whereupon, according to step (c), the application of a<br>
seed layer of a thin, conductive material is realized over<br>
the entire surface. Such an application may, for instance,<br>
be effected by sputtering or thermal vapor deposition.<br>
After this, the relief structure is coppered according to<br>
step (d), and the projecting copper built up by the<br>
galvanization process is removed in step (e), for instance<br>
by chemical or mechanical processes, so as to enable, as a<br>
function of the desired structure of the intermediate layer<br>
4, the formation of contact zones 6 and 7 according to the<br>
positions of the contact or connection sites 5 of the<br>
electronic component 3 and the contact or connection<br>
surfaces 8 of the circuit board 2 as well as the required<br>
ultra-fine conductive tracks 9.<br>
For the production of the intermediate layer 4,<br>
thermoplastic materials like, e.g., polyetherimide, liquid<br>
crystal polymer (LCP) may be used.<br>
Alternatively to the use of thermoplastic materials,<br>
thermally or UV-curable materials may be employed for the<br>
structuring of the intermediate layer 4.<br><br>
Furthermore, the application of a	conductive layer<br>
described in steps (c) and (d) may be	replaced with the<br>
filling of the depressions or recesses	with a conductive<br>
material.<br>
Instead of using an embossing technique, the removal of the<br>
polymer material used for the intermediate layer 4 may, for<br>
instance, be done by the aid of laser light.<br>
For the structuring of the circuit board or the arrangement<br>
of the conductive connection or contact zones 6 and 7,<br>
respectively, as well as the conductive tracks 9, known<br>
subtractive techniques, semi-additive techniques or<br>
additive techniques may, moreover, be employed.<br>
In the exemplary embodiments illustrated in Figs. 4 to 7,<br>
the reference numerals of the preceding Figures, in<br>
particular those of Fig. 1, have been retained for<br>
identical components.<br>
According to the illustration of Fig. 4, the attachment of<br>
the electronic component 3 is again realized via contacts<br>
10 on the intermediate layer 4 for contacting with the<br>
circuit board 2, wherein Fig. 4, in addition, depicts the<br>
electronic component 3 in greater detail, from which it is,<br>
in particular, apparent that the latter is arranged on a<br>
plate-shaped support structure 15 and surrounded by a<br>
sheathing 16.<br>
From the modified illustration according to Fig. 5, it is<br>
apparent that an electronic component again denoted by 3 is<br>
inserted without the support structure and sheathing<br>
structure 15 and 16, respectively, illustrated in Fig. 4,<br><br>
but is directly connected or coupled, via connection or<br>
contact sites again denoted by 5, with the respective<br>
contact zones 6 of the intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement, via which a connection or junction to the<br>
circuit board again denoted by 2 is subsequently realized<br>
via the connection or contact surfaces 8.<br>
In the configuration according to Fig. 5, the intermediate<br>
layer 4 for disentanglement, moreover, serves directly as a<br>
support structure and, hence, fulfils a supporting or<br>
carrying function for the electronic component 3 such that<br>
additional contacts may be obviated. This results in a<br>
reduction of costs and, at the same time, an enhanced<br>
connection of the electronic component 3 to the<br>
intermediate layer 4 and, hence, to the circuit board 2.<br>
For the proper fixation and protection of the unpackaged<br>
component 3, a sheathing 17 surrounding the electronic<br>
component 3 and supported on the intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement is indicated in the embodiment according to<br>
Fig. 5.<br>
In the embodiment according to Fig. 6, an unpackaged<br>
electronic component 3 is employed, which is directly<br>
coupled with the intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement.<br>
Further layers 18 and 19 are indicated above the component<br>
3, wherein, in particular in the region of these layers,<br>
additional contacts or connections 20 are indicated, which<br>
serve for the attachment of further components not shown in<br>
Fig. 6. The contacting of such further components via the<br>
connections or contacts 20 in the embodiment illustrated in<br>
Fig. 6 is again realized upon interposition of the<br>
intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement.<br><br>
In the embodiment represented in Fig. 7, the electronic<br>
component 3 is arranged with the connection or contact<br>
sites facing away from the circuit board 2, the<br>
intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement being arranged<br>
above the electronic component 3 and subsequent contacting<br>
being again effected with connection or contact surfaces 8<br>
of the circuit board 2. In the embodiments according to<br>
Figs. 6 and 7, an integration of the electronic component 3<br>
is, thus, immediately enabled, this resulting in a further<br>
integration of embedded components and an increased<br>
compactness at the simultaneous reduction of the overall<br>
size of the system.<br>
By using the intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement<br>
between the connection or contact sites 5 of the electronic<br>
component 3 and also the contact or connection surfaces 8<br>
of the circuit board 2, an intermediate layer 4 having a<br>
reduced thickness, in particular in respect to the<br>
dielectric layer, particularly as compared to the thickness<br>
of usual circuit board layers, will thus, be enough such<br>
that, in the main, only a negligible increase in the<br>
thickness of the overall circuit board will occur.<br>
Furthermox-e, a single intermediate layer 4 for<br>
disentanglement will do in most cases, said intermediate<br>
layer 4, as opposed to usual circuit board layers, for<br>
disentanglement only comprising contact zones 6 and 7 as<br>
well as very fine or ultra-fine conductive tracks or<br>
conductive structures 9 which are adaptable to the small<br>
distances of connections or connection sites 5 of highly<br>
complex electronic components 3, without requiring a<br>
plurality of layers and, in particular, additional circuit<br><br>
board layers for the disentanglement of such highly complex<br>
components 3.<br>
When using electronic components 3 comprising extremely<br>
large numbers of connection or contact sites, whose number<br>
may range from some hundreds to some thousands, it may,<br>
moreover, be provided that a further intermediate layer is<br>
applied or deposited on an intermediate layer 4, for<br>
instance according to the process schematically illustrated<br>
in Fig. 3, wherein appropriate feedthroughs or microvias<br>
are provided for contacting with the circuit board 2<br>
arranged therebelow, or the circuit board layers forming<br>
the circuit board 2. Bearing in mind the fact that the<br>
thickness of such an optionally required, additional<br>
intermediate layer 4 is again strongly reduced as compared<br>
to the thickness of an additional circuit board layer and,<br>
in particular, its dielectric layer, and further bearing in<br>
mind that, due to the simplified structuring of such an<br>
intermediate layer 4 for disentanglement, the latter<br>
substantially comprises but very fine or ultra-fine<br>
conductive track structures 9, a negligible increase in the<br>
overall thickness of the circuit board 2 along with the<br>
intermediate layers 4 will do even if more than one<br>
intermediate layer 4 is provided for disentanglement in the<br>
region of highly complex components 3. By contrast, it will<br>
have to be taken into account that, with an optionally<br>
sought disentanglement via additional circuit board layers,<br>
the number of circuit board layers will have to be<br>
considerably increased on account of the more complex<br>
structures of the latter as compared to the simple<br>
structure, of the intermediate layer 4 such that an<br>
accordingly high increase in the overall thickness of the<br><br>
circuit board 2 as well as the production costs will be<br>
involved.<br>
In addition, the arrangement of the thin intermediate layer<br>
4 renders feasible the provision of larger connection sites<br>
or zones so as to meet the requirements of a registering<br>
accuracy of the individual layers even when using large-<br>
sized production formats of printed circuit boards and, in<br>
particular, HDI boards. The tapering or conically shaped<br>
bores provided in the region of passages will require<br>
little space considering the thickness reduction, thus<br>
lowering the requirements of a registration or orientation<br>
accuracy.<br><br>
