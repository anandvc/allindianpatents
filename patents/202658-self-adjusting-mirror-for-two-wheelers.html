				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to self-adjusting mirror for two-wheelers and more particularly the rate of vertical and horizontal degrees with respect to handle rotation is such that it provides a constant rear vision.<br>
Description of prior art<br>
Conventional mirror., which is attached on a two-wheeler, rotates along with the handle, i.e. when a two-wheeler takes a turn the mirror also rotates along with the handle.<br>
Conventional mirror attached on a two-wheeler does not give a constant rear vision at any degree of handle rotation except when it is straight. More ovtv as described in the GB Patent no. GB944254 according to this invention primarily, this is a device provided in combination to a road vehicle driving mirror and a parking and/or signalling light, which primarily intends to serve as a parking light, and it may alternatively be used as a front or rear flashing indicator unit. Also according to GB Patent no. GB 683013, according to this invention there is provided a rear view mirror of a freight vehicle, which is able to extend out from its position, moreover it is a device which is purely manual, however there is no provision for self-adjustment or automatic movement of (he mirror in the cited document. It is a device which is purely manual.<br>
Drawback<br>
Convention mirror attached on a two-wheeler does not give a constant rear vision<br>
at any degree of handle rotation except when it is straight.<br>
So for	(a)      taking U-turn<br>
(b)	lane changing<br>
(c)	overtaking of vehicles<br>
the driver has to look back to make a note of vehicle (rear vision) coming from back and in doing so if the vehicle in front of him retards or breaks, the driver on two wheeler may just go and collide with the vehicle in front of him. So the conventional mirror does not provide any kind of safety to the driver.<br>
I A-<br><br>
Difference between the prior art and the present invention<br>
Conventional minor attached on a two-wheeler does not give a constant rear vision at any degree of handle rotation except when it is straight.<br>
Self-adjusting mirror gives constant rear vision for any degree of handle rotation.<br>
In conventional mirror the rotary motion of the handle is not converted to any other motion.<br>
In self-adjusting mirror, the rotary motion is converted into reciprocating motion and then transferred to lever mechanism and then converted in the form of angular displacement in horizontal and vertical planes at appropriate angles.<br>
Conventional mirror consists of a ordinary mirror which does not give constant rear vision at any degree of handle rotation except when it is straight.<br>
Self-adjusting mirror along with the ordinary mirror has a mechanism, which enables the ordinary mirror i.e. conventional mirror to give constant rear vision at any degree of handle rotation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a safety device to obviate high rale of accidents especially in crowded areas. Majority of these are due to two-wheelers and as such users of these wheelers are never said to be safe while using the conventional mirror for U-turn, lane changing and overtaking oi' vehicles, the driver has to look back to make a note oi~ vehicle coming from back and in doing so if the vehicle in front of him brakes or even if it retards the driver on two wheeler may just go and collide with the vehicle in front of him.<br>
To avoid such accidents or to decrease the rate of accidents, we have come forward with self-adjusting mirror which basically serve as a safely device which provides a constant rear vision for any degree of handle rotation to ensure maximum safety to the driver.<br>
Objectives<br>
To reduce the rale of accidents drastically To reduce operator fatigue<br><br>
To facilitate easy and convenient driving without much danger.<br>
To provide more safely driving while taking a U-turn, lane changing and overtaking of vehicles.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a self-adjusting mirror for two-wheelers comprising a rod with threading at one end, a lock nut, a mirror characterized in that a fork at another end of rod, a lever fitted with the fork, by a fulcrum bolt and fulcrum nut for assembling fork and lever, a cable wire placed through lever, a spring placed between (ever and fork through which the cable wire passes outside the fork in downward direction till the end of a cable wire is locked in the cable wire locking attachment by a bolt and nut which is mounted on fork plate with the help of a bolt, a cable cover for covering the cable wire by clearance fit, a cable cover locking attachment mounted around a head pipe of the steering by bolt and nut through which cable wire passes and cable cover is locked to avoid/prevent relative motion of cable cover. The mirror is mechanically fitted with the lever. The cable wire comprising a head, which is manufactured inbuilt with the cable wire. The fork is press fitted with the rod. Cable wire locking attachment has inside threading on its horizontal plate.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings<br>
We    should    now   describe   the    invention    with    reference    to<br>
accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration but do not<br>
restrict the scope of the present invention:<br>
Fig. 1	shows self-adjusting mirror for a two-wheeler.<br>
Fig.2	shows the locking attachment for cable wire and cable cover.<br>
Fig.3	shows detailed description of tilting mechanism.<br>
Fig.4	shows the lever mechanism.<br>
-3-<br><br>
-4-<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiment:<br>
In the above-mentioned figures and particularly figure 1 and 2, shows a Self-adjusting rear view mirror (3) fitted with lever (5). The mirror (3) and lever (5) is fixed with the fork (4) with help of fulcrum bolt (6) and fulcrum nut (7). Spring (9) is placed between lever (5) and fork (4). The fork (4) is fixed inside the rod (1), which has threading at other end by means of which it is fitted on the handle of the two-wheeler. To lock the rod (1) at exact position a lock nut (2) is used. Cable Wire (8) is passed through the hole of lever (5), then through the spring (9) and then through hole in fork (4) and then through the rod (1). Cable Wire (8) is covered with Cable Cover (11). Cable Cover (11) passed over cable (8), is placed inside the rod (1) till fork (4) end. The other end of Cable Cover (11) is fixed with Cable Cover Locking Arrangement (12), which is mounted on the head pipe of steering of two-wheeler by bolt (6C). Cable Wire (8) is fixed on the Cable Wire locking Arrangement (10), which is fixed on fork plate of two-wheeler by means of bolt (6A) and nut (7 A).<br>
When the user rotates the handle of the two-wheeler, the cable wire (8), which is fixed on the fork plate of the two-wheeler, gets stretched, this causes the lever (5) on which the mirror (3) is mounted to rotate around the fulcrum bolt (6) which results in rotary/angular motion of the mirror<br>
(3).<br>
When handle is released or brought back to straight position the mirror (3) comes back to original position as it was by means of the spring (9) placed between lever (9) and fork (4).<br><br>
-5-<br>
Figure 3 shows details of Tilting Mechanism wherein the lever (5) is fixed in the fork (4) by means of fulcrum bolt (6) and fulcrum nut (7). Spring (9) is placed between lever (5) and fork (4).<br>
Fig. 4 shows, the lever (5) is fixed in the fork (4). Spring (9) is placed between lever (5) and fork (4). Also seen is Cable Wire (8), which passed through the lever (5) then through spring (9) and fork (4). As the cable wire (8) will get stretched the lever (5) will rotate around axis of fulcrum bolt (6).<br><br>
