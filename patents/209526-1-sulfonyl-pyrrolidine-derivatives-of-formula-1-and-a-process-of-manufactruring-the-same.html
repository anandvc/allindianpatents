R     signifies aryl, which is optionally substituted by halogen or lower alkyl;<br>
R’        signifies -0R\ cyano, halogen, N-hydroxy-amidino, -C(0)-OR, 'C(0)NR'R",<br>
-N(R')-C{0)-R\ -N{R')'S(0)2-R, -N{R')'C(S)-NR*R or 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl groups containing 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected independently from each other from N or O, which are optionally substituted by lower alkyl or cycloalkyl; R      signifies cycloalkyl, phenyl or lower alkyl, which is optionally substituted by halogen;<br>

as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of general formula I possess affinity towards melanotropic glutamate receptors. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br><br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-contoured ion channels. The melanotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:<br>
mGluRl and mGluRS belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGIuR6, mGIuR7 and gurus belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hyperglycaemia. Further treatable indications are Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, duskiness and depressions.<br>
Objects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, racemic mixtures and their corresponding enantiomers, the above-mentioned compounds as pharmaceutically active substances, their manufacture, medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their production as well as the use of the compounds in accordance with the invention in the control or prevention of illnesses of the aforementioned kind, and, respectively, for the production of corresponding medicaments.<br><br>

The compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured by<br><br><br><br>
and, if desired,<br>
converting a functional group of R’ in a compound of formula I into another functional<br>
group,<br>
and if desired,<br>
converting a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be obtained directly by simply exchanging the functional group at position R’ by another functional group.<br>
In accordance with the invention, an appropriately substituted compound of formula II, for example methyl (2RS,5SR)'5-(4-fiuorophenyl)-l-pyrrolidine-2-carbQxylate, is reacted with a suitable compound of formula III, for example toluene-4-suIfonyl chloride and triethylamine (see Scheme 1). R\ R’ and n have the significance given earlier. The reaction according to known methods is carried out at room temperature within 16 hours in an inert solvent, for example in dichloromethane.<br><br>
A compound of formula II is prepared by reacting a suitable compound of formula V with diethyl acetaminomalonate (IV) followed by hydrogenation on platinum oxide according to Scheme 2 or, for the case when R’ is H (see Example 84), DL-proline methyl ester can be used as starting material.<br><br><br>
A stereoselective synthesis of a compound of formula II can be achieved by reacting optically pure N-Boc-pyroglutamate with (4-fluoro-phenyl)magnesium bromide according to the methods described in Tetrahedron Letters 34, 6317-6320, 1999, J. Med. Chem. 39, 2594-2608,1996 and Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 10,2245-2303, 1999.<br>
Scheme 3 shows how prolongation of the side chain starting with a compound of formula la, for example (2RS, 5SR)-5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-l-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (Example 1), can be achieved. For instance, after reduction with lithium aluminium hydride to the corresponding alcohol, desolation and nucleophilic substitution by cyanide compounds of formula Ic having a side chain with 2 C-atoms are obtained. Compounds of formula la.l containing 3 C-atoms in the side chain are prepared by oxidation of the alcohol to the aldehyde VII followed by Witting reaction and hydrogenation.<br><br>
Tetrazolyl derivatives of formula If (e. g. Examples 27, 39, 40,49, 50) can be prepared by a 1,3-dipolar addition of sodium azide to a nitrile of formula Ic The nitrile is preferably obtained by converting the ester group of a compound of formula Ia2 into the amide and dehydrating the amide with phosphorus oxychloride. Methyl-1,2,4-Triazolyl derivatives of formula Ig (e.g. examples 26, 69,70) can be manufactured by addition of<br><br>
methylhydrazine to the nitrile. The cyano group of a compound of formula Icm can further be hydrogenated to the corresponding amine, which maybe acylated with a suitable acylchloride to obtain a compound of formula le (e.g. examples 9&gt; 15,16). The acylation is preferably carried out with pyridine in dichloromethane. An overview of these reactions is given in Scheme 4 below. R'‘ has the significance given earlier.<br><br>
The formation of a l,2,4-oxadia2olyl ring can be achieved by condensation of an acid of formula VIII with N-hydroxy-acetamidine as follows: a solution of the acid and 1,1'-carbonyl-diimidazole is stirred in DMF at room temperature for 2h. N-hydroxy-acetamidine is then added and the reaction mixture is heated to 80’C for 16 h. After evaporation and solvation in acetic acid the reaction mixture is heated under reflux conditions for 2h and after purification using known methods a compound of formula Ih (e.g. Example 25) is obtained (see Scheme 5).<br>
l,2,4-Oxadia2olyl derivatives of formula Ij (e.g. Example 13) can be manufactured from the nitrile of formula Icl by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to obtain the carboxamidine   which is condensed with acetic acid in DMF in the presence of 1,1'-carbonyl-diimidazole to form the l,2,4-oxadia2olyl ring.<br><br><br>
The hydroxyl group of a compound of formula Ibl can be methylated by known methods to obtain a compound of formula Im or substituted by a halogen atom. For example, reaction with thionylchloride yields the corresponding chorally derivative (Ic). The halogen atom can further be substituted with a cyclic amine, for example 1,2,4-triazol (see Example 82), with the help of sodium hydride at O'‘C. The product, a compound of formula II, is purified by known methods* In Scheme 6, X signifies, independently from each other, a N-atom or a C-atom.<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods knave per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, trimeric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts possess, as already mentioned above, affinity towards metabotropic glutamate receptors (group 1 mGluR receptors) and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
cDNA encoding rat mGlu la receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by E.-J. Schlaeger and K. Christensen (Transient gene expression in mammalian cells grown in serum-free suspension culture; Cytotechnology,<br>
15:1-13,1998). [Ca’"‘]i measurements were performed on mGlu la transfected EBNA cells after incubation of the cells with Fluo-3 AM (0.5 }.iM final concentration) for 1 hour at 37°C followed by 4 washes with assay buffer (DMEM supplemented with Hank's salt and 20 mM HEPES. [Ca’**']i measurements were done using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Joum, CA, USA). When compounds were evaluated as antagonists they were tested against 10 |iM glutamate as agonist.<br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g, in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like*<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizer, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earner, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/kg/day being<br><br>
preterred for all of the indications described* The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly Ues between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
Finally, as mentioned earlier, the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind, is also an object of the invention.<br>
