CONSUMABLE ELCTRODE ARC WELDING METHOD AND<br>
CONSUMABLE ELECTRODE ARC WELDING DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to consumable electrode arc welding<br>
methods and consumable electrode arc welding devices that feed a<br>
welding wire, which is a consumable electrode, and welds the wire onto a<br>
workpiece to be welded by alternately generating a short circuit state and<br>
an arc condition between the consumable electrode and the workpiece.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Demand for faster welding speed and less spatter, so as to increase<br>
productivity, have been increasing in the welding industry. Faster<br>
welding speed increases production quantity per time, and thus welding<br>
productivity increases. Less spattering reduces a post-treatment process<br>
of removing spatter attached to a base material, and thus welding<br>
productivity also increases.<br>
Fig. 5 shows waveforms of wire feed speed Wf, welding voltage Vw,<br>
and welding current Aw in conventional arc welding. First, conventional<br>
arc welding is described with reference to Fig. 5. In a known welding<br>
process, the wire feed speed is changed cyclically to forcibly cause a short<br>
circuit, and arc is re-generated by forcibly opening the short circuit (for<br>
 <br>
example, refer to Patent Literature 1). In this prior art, the short circuit<br>
is opened without depending on electromagnetic pinch force of welding<br>
current, and thus spatter can be reduced.<br>
In Fig. 5, time T1 is one time point in an arc period while arc is<br>
generated between a wire end and a base material. Wire feed speed Wf<br>
accelerates toward maximum speed Wf2.<br>
At time T2, the wire and the base material are short-circuited, and<br>
a short circuit period starts. Wire feed speed Wf is controlled cyclically,<br>
regardless of an arc condition, according to a predetermined command<br>
value. Accordingly, a short-circuit timing may be a time point other than<br>
when wire feed speed Wf is at maximum speed Wf2. The short-circuit<br>
timing is a time point when the wire feed speed is around the maximum<br>
speed Wf2. It may be a time point during forward acceleration or<br>
forward deceleration. The timing differs with every short circuit.<br>
Time T3, at which the short circuit is opened and arc is<br>
regenerated, comes during backward feed. A short-circuit opening<br>
timing may be a time point other than when wire feed speed Wf is at<br>
minimum speed (Wf4). The short-circuit opening timing is a time point<br>
when the wire feed speed is around minimum speed Wf4. It may be a<br>
time point during backward deceleration or backward acceleration. The<br>
timing differs with every short-circuit opening. At any timing, however,<br>
the short circuit is opened during backward feed. Accordingly, the short<br>
circuit is forcibly opened without depending on electromagnetic pinch<br>
force of welding current, and thus spatter can be reduced.<br>
 <br>
Wire feed speed Wf includes one forward feed and one backward<br>
feed in its one cycle. In one cycle, one short circuit and one opening of<br>
short circuit take place. In response to this cyclic operation of wire feed<br>
speed Wf, welding involving arc phenomenon is controlled. A<br>
predetermined cycle of wire feed speed Wf is a short-circuit generating<br>
frequency or the number of short circuits per second. This stabilizes<br>
welding while reducing spatter.<br>
With respect to a welding device in which the wire is controlled to<br>
feed forward and backward, there is disclosed a welding control method of<br>
controlling the wire feed speed in response to welding phenomenon. (For<br>
example, refer to Patent Literature 2.) The wire feed speed is<br>
accelerated during the arc period, and is then controlled at a<br>
predetermined constant speed. When a short circuit is detected, the wire<br>
feed speed is decelerated, and then the wire is drawn up at a<br>
predetermined constant speed different from the above constant speed to<br>
open the short circuit and regenerate arc. Welding takes place through<br>
repetition of these operations. Also in this method, the short circuit is<br>
opened during backward feed. Accordingly, the short circuit is forcibly<br>
opened without depending on the electromagnetic pinch force of welding<br>
current, and thus spatter can be reduced.<br>
In the aforementioned conventional welding control method<br>
disclosed in Patent Literature 1, stable welding with less spatter is<br>
achievable if there is no disturbance such as change of distance between<br>
the tip and base material. However, for example, if the position of base<br>
material deviates and the distance from the tip becomes longer during<br>
 <br>
welding, the distance between the tip and base material becomes<br>
suddenly longer at timing A shown in Fig. 5. When this extended<br>
distance becomes greater than a distance advanced in the forward feed<br>
period of the wire feed speed, a short circuit does not occur. Then, the<br>
process goes on to backward feed in this state, which means the state<br>
without short circuit continues. Accordingly, generation of short circuit<br>
is delayed until the next forward feed period (e.g., until time T4). During<br>
this period without generation of short circuit, a droplet is formed at the<br>
wire end, and this droplet grows. A large droplet is released from the<br>
wire end by the movement of wire due to the change of distance between<br>
the tip and base material. This may become spatter and may splatter<br>
out of a weld pool. Even if the droplet does not splatter outside, a large<br>
droplet extends the short circuit state. The short circuit may not be<br>
sufficiently opened in the next short circuit, and thus the droplet may<br>
adhere to the base material. As a result, the state of unstable arc has<br>
occurred.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, let's say a short circuit occurs at time T5, and<br>
distance between the tip and base material becomes suddenly shorter at<br>
timing B. If this shortened distance becomes greater than a length of<br>
wire drawn up at the wire feed speed in the backward feed period, the<br>
short circuit continues without being opened until the next backward feed<br>
period (e.g., until time T6). In this case, temperature of a welded portion<br>
decreases, and weld bead narrows and thins due to extended short circuit<br>
time. This may result in uneven bead width. In addition, welding may<br>
become not feasible due to deposited wire end and base material.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, if a high current of about 400A to 500A is continuously<br>
applied, a short-circuiting wire portion may splatter by generating a large<br>
amount of spatter by means of electromagnetic pinch force, and arc may<br>
be regenerated. In any case, spatter generation increases, and the bead<br>
width becomes uneven.<br>
In the welding device, in which the wire is controlled to feed<br>
forward and backward, disclosed in Patent Literature 2, the cycle of<br>
forward feed and backward feed of the wire feed speed is controlled in<br>
response to the arc phenomenon in the conventional welding control<br>
method for controlling the wire feed speed in line with the welding<br>
phenomenon. Accordingly, if the short circuit time becomes longer, the<br>
backward feed becomes longer. If the arc time becomes longer, the<br>
forward feed becomes longer. Opposite states are also controlled in the<br>
same way. The average feed speed of wire feed speed, short circuit cycle,<br>
and the number of short circuits become unstable and change if the arc<br>
phenomenon changes. Welding results thus cannot be stabilized.<br>
If there is almost no change in the distance between the tip and<br>
base material, there is no problem. However, external disturbance such<br>
as change of distance between the tip and base material typically due to<br>
deviation in placement of base material or variations in accuracy of<br>
components, such as pressed components, frequently occur at actual<br>
production sites. Accordingly, the average feed speed of wire feed speed<br>
and short circuit cycle greatly change and fluctuate, resulting in difficulty<br>
to stabilize welding results.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A consumable electrode arc welding method of the present<br>
invention is a consumable electrode arc welding method in which welding<br>
takes place at a wire feed speed that cyclically changes between forward<br>
feed for feeding toward a workpiece and backward feed for feeding in a<br>
direction opposite to the forward feed in a predetermined cycle and<br>
amplitude. If a short circuit does not occur during deceleration of wire<br>
feed speed in the forward feed of the welding wire before the wire feed<br>
speed reaches a predetermined wire feed speed, before a predetermined<br>
time passes from arc generation, or before a feed cycle of welding wire<br>
reaches a predetermined angle when a predetermined feed cycle of<br>
welding wire is expressed by an angle; the cyclic change of wire feed speed<br>
is stopped and the speed is constantly controlled at the first feed speed.<br>
If a short circuit occurs during forward feed at the first feed speed,<br>
deceleration from the first feed speed starts, and the cyclic change is<br>
resumed for welding.<br>
The consumable electrode arc welding method of the present<br>
invention is a consumable electrode arc welding method in which welding<br>
takes place at a wire feed speed that cyclically changes between forward<br>
 <br>
feed for feeding toward a workpiece and backward feed for feeding in a<br>
direction opposite to the forward feed in a predetermined cycle and<br>
amplitude. If a short circuit is not opened during acceleration of wire<br>
feed speed in backward feed of the welding wire before the wire feed speed<br>
reaches a predetermined wire feed speed, before a predetermined time<br>
passes from short circuit generation, or before a feed cycle of welding wire<br>
reaches a predetermined angle when a predetermined feed cycle of<br>
welding wire is expressed by an angle; the cyclic change of wire feed speed<br>
is stopped and the speed is constantly controlled at the second feed speed.<br>

acceleration from the second feed speed starts, and the cyclic change is<br>
resumed for welding.<br>

arc state and short circuit state between the welding wire and workpiece.<br>
The arc welding device includes a switching element for controlling<br>
welding output; a welding voltage detector for detecting welding voltage; a<br>
welding condition setting unit for setting current; a short circuit/arc<br>
detector for detecting the short circuit state and arc state based on an<br>
output of the welding voltage detector; a memory for storing the set<br>
current, average feed speed of wire feed speed, frequency of wire feed<br>
speed, and amplitude of wire feed speed in a linked manner; a wire feed<br>

setting unit; and a wire feed speed controller for controlling cyclic change<br>
of forward feed and backward feed of the wire feed speed by receiving the<br>
output of the short circuit/arc detector and the output of the wire feed<br>
speed determinator. The wire feed speed controller stops a cyclic change<br>
of the wire feed speed and applies constant control at the first feed speed<br>
if a short circuit does not occur during deceleration of wire feed speed in<br>
forward feed of the welding wire before the wire feed speed reaches a<br>
predetermined wire feed speed, before a predetermined time passes from<br>
arc generation, or before a feed cycle of welding wire reaches a<br>
predetermined angle when a predetermined feed cycle of welding wire is<br>
expressed by an angle. If a short circuit occurs during forward feed at<br>
the first feed speed, deceleration from the first feed speed starts, and the<br>
cyclic change of wire feed speed is resumed for welding.<br>
The consumable electrode arc welding device of the present<br>
invention is an arc welding device in which welding takes place by<br>
repetition of the arc state and short circuit state between the welding wire<br>
and workpiece. The arc welding device includes a switching element for<br>
controlling welding output; a welding voltage detector for detecting<br>
welding voltage; a welding condition setting unit for setting current; a<br>
short circuit/arc detector for detecting the short circuit state and arc state<br>
based on an output of the welding voltage detector; a memory for storing<br>
the set current, average feed speed of wire feed speed, frequency of wire<br>
feed speed, and amplitude of wire feed speed in a linked manner; a wire<br>
feed speed determinator for determining the average feed speed of wire<br>
feed speed, frequency of wire feed speed, and amplitude of wire feed speed<br>
 <br>
from the memory based on the set current set by the welding condition<br>
setting unit; and a wire feed speed controller for controlling cyclic change<br>
of forward feed and backward feed of the wire feed speed in a cycle by<br>
receiving the output of the short circuit/arc detector and the output of the<br>
wire feed speed determinator. The wire feed speed controller stops a<br>
cyclic change of the wire feed speed and applies constant control at the<br>
second feed speed if a short circuit is not opened during acceleration of<br>
wire feed speed in backward feed of the welding wire before the wire feed<br>
speed reaches a predetermined wire feed speed, before a predetermined<br>
time passes from arc generation, or before a feed cycle of welding wire<br>
reaches a predetermined angle when a predetermined feed cycle of<br>
welding wire is expressed by an angle. If a short circuit is opened during<br>
backward feed at the second feed speed, acceleration from the second feed<br>
speed starts, and the cyclic change of wire feed speed is resumed for<br>
welding.<br>
With the above structure, spatter can be reduced and uniform bead<br>
can be achieved by controlling the wire feed speed, even if any external<br>
disturbance, such as change of distance between the tip and base material,<br>
occurs during arc generation. Accordingly, stability of arc can be<br>
enhanced.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described<br>
below with reference to Figs. 1 to 4.<br>
(FIRST EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT)<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an arc welding device in this<br>
exemplary embodiment. Fig. 2 shows waveforms of a wire feed speed,<br>
 <br>
welding voltage, and welding current when welding takes place adopting<br>
a consumable electrode arc welding control method in this exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
In Fig. 1, input AC voltage from input power supply 1 is applied to<br>
welding power supply 14, and is rectified by primary rectifying element 3.<br>
Switching element 4 switches and controls an output of primary rectifying<br>
element 3 to an output appropriate for welding, and main transformer 2<br>
converts the input power supply to an output appropriate for welding.<br>
Secondary rectifying element 6 rectifies one of secondary outputs<br>
insulated from the primary side in main transformer 2, and reactor 5<br>
smoothes it to a current appropriate for welding. The current smoothed<br>
by reactor 5 is applied to torch 18 via one welding power output terminal<br>
14a. The other secondary output of main transformer 2 is connected to<br>
base material 15 via welding current detector 8 that detects welding<br>
current and also via other welding power output terminal 14b.<br>
Welding voltage detector 9 for detecting welding voltage is<br>
connected between welding power output terminals 14a and 14b. Wire<br>
16 is fed from wire storage 25 to tip 20 attached to torch 18 by wire feeder<br>
19 controlled by wire feed speed controller 13 that controls the wire feed<br>
speed. Wire 16 is used as a consumable electrode. Arc 17 is generated<br>
from an end of wire 16 to base material 15 by the welding power supply<br>
output. Short circuit/arc detector 10 determines whether a welding state<br>
is a short circuit state in which wire 16 and base material 15 are making<br>
contact, or an arc state in which a short circuit is opened and arc is<br>
generated, based on a welding voltage detection signal from welding<br>
 <br>
voltage detector 9 connected to short circuit/arc detector 10. This<br>
determination is input to output controller 11 and wire feed speed<br>
controller 13.<br>
Welding condition setting unit 12 outputs welding conditions (set<br>
welding current and set welding voltage) set by an operator to output<br>
controller 11 that controls the welding output and wire feed speed<br>
controller 13. Detection signals of welding current detector 8 and<br>
welding voltage detector 9 are input to output controller 11. Memory 21<br>
and wire feed speed determinator 22 in wire feed speed controller 13 are<br>
described later.<br>
Fig. 2 shows waveforms illustrating changes by time of welding<br>
voltage Vw that is welding output voltage and welding current Aw that is<br>
welding output current. In Fig. 2, when wire feed speed Wf is positive,<br>
it indicates that the wire is fed forward to base material 15. When wire<br>
feed speed Wf is negative, wire 16 is fed away from base material 15. In<br>
other words, it means wire 16 is drawn up in backward feed.<br>
Time t1 shown in Fig. 2 is within the arc period where arc is<br>
generated. Outputs of welding voltage Vw and welding current Aw are<br>
controlled to form an appropriate droplet in order to smoothly transfer the<br>
droplet at the wire end in a coming short circuit period. Wire feed speed<br>
Wf changes cyclically according to a predetermined command value<br>
(amplitude, frequency, and average feed speed) regardless of the arc<br>
condition (short circuit period or arc period). At time tl, wire 16 is fed<br>
forward in an accelerated manner. In Fig. 2, acceleration is a direction<br>
that the wire feed speed changes from the peak of backward feed to the<br>
 <br>
peak of forward feed. Deceleration is a direction that the wire feed speed<br>
changes from the peak of forward feed to the peak of backward feed. The<br>
peak of forward feed in the wire feed speed is maximum speed Wf2, and<br>
the peak of backward feed in the wire feed speed is minimum speed Wf4<br>
in the description.<br>
In the short circuit period from time t2 to t3, welding current Aw<br>
reduces from time t2, which is an initial point of short circuit, by<br>
controlling the current, so as to ensure generation of short circuit. Then,<br>
welding current Aw is increased in a predetermined slope. On the other<br>
hand, the wire is fed in a predetermined cycle of wire feed speed Wf, and<br>
wire feed speed Wf changes from the acceleration period to deceleration<br>
period regardless of the arc condition. If this cycle of wire feed speed Wf<br>
is between 30 to 100 Hz, there is no problem. Wire feed speed Wf<br>
decelerates and transfers from forward feed to backward feed in the short<br>
circuit period from time t2 to time t3. Then, at time t3, when backward<br>
feed starts, the short circuit is forcibly opened, and arc is regenerated.<br>
In the output control during the arc period, starting from time t3,<br>
there is a higher tendency that higher peak current IP of welding current<br>
Aw penetrates into the weld pool deeper due to higher arc convergence,<br>
typically in CO2 welding. In the worst case, the base material may melt<br>
off. On the other hand, if peak current IP is too low, a faint short circuit<br>
may occur. Accordingly, peak current IP needs to be set to minimum<br>
necessary welding current Aw in order to avoid generation of faint short<br>
circuit and also prevent penetration of weld pool. An appropriate value<br>
 <br>
for this peak current IP is obtained typically through experiments<br>
depending on a workpiece to be welded.<br>
During the arc period on and after time t3, a short circuit occurs in<br>
the forward feed of wire feed speed Wf if there is no disturbance and the<br>
distance between the tip and base material is constant. However, if any<br>
disturbance, such as longer distance between the tip and base material<br>
due to a deviated placement position of base material away from the tip<br>
end, occurs at time A, the arc period continues without occurrence of short<br>
circuit. Therefore, in this exemplary embodiment, the welding wire is<br>
fed cyclically according to the predetermined command value for wire feed<br>
speed Wf, and the speed accelerates up to maximum speed Wf2 during<br>
forward feed. Then, deceleration starts during forward feed. If the<br>
short circuit does not occur even if the speed is reduced to first feed speed<br>
Wfl, which is the predetermined wire feed speed, deceleration is stopped<br>
and switched to the control of feeding the welding wire at a constant<br>
value of first feed speed Wfl. This first feed speed Wfl is wire feed speed<br>
Wf in forward feed for feeding welding wire 16 toward base material 15.<br>
Accordingly, a short circuit will certainly occur as time passes.<br>
Accordingly, backward feed does not start without a short circuit, which<br>
was a disadvantage of the prior art. A droplet at the wire end will not<br>
grow and thus spatter will not increase.<br>
A short circuit can be generated earlier by setting this first feed<br>
speed Wf to the average feed speed set corresponding to each set welding<br>
current or faster than the average. To cause short circuit at earlier<br>
timing, higher first feed speed Wfl is better. However, first feed speed<br>
 <br>
Wf1 is preferably not as high as maximum speed Wf2. This is because if<br>
the distance between the tip and base material is constant when no<br>
disturbance occurs, a short circuit is generated at timing when wire feed<br>
speed Wf is around maximum speed Wf2 (within about ±1/8 cycle).<br>
Therefore, a short circuit may occur after deceleration starts from<br>
maximum speed Wf2.<br>
If the distance between tip and base material is constant, there is<br>
almost no influence on opening of short circuit even if the timing of short<br>
circuit deviates around maximum speed Wf2 for about ±1/8 cycle.<br>
Therefore, the welding wire can be just cyclically fed at wire feed speed<br>
Wf according to the predetermined command value. However, for<br>
example, if a value of first feed speed Wfl and a value of maximum speed<br>
Wf2 are set to the same value, all wire feed speeds Wf after the timing<br>
that a short circuit occurs at maximum speed Wf2 may be controlled to a<br>
constant value. This will disturb the cycle of wire feed speed Wf. This<br>
disturbance of cycle leads to variations in the cyclic nature of generation<br>
and opening of short circuit or the number of short circuits. Welding<br>
results thus become unstable.<br>
If a short circuit is not generated, the feed speed is preferably<br>
controlled to a constant value roughly between the average feed speed set<br>
for each set welding current and an intermediate speed of maximum<br>
speed Wf2 of amplitude (speed at a point 1/8 cycle after maximum speed<br>
Wf2). In other words, if the feed speed controlled at a constant value is<br>
between the average feed speed and the speed at a time point 1/8 cycle<br>
after maximum speed Wf2, the cycle of wire feed speed Wf will not be<br>
 <br>
disturbed. If the feed speed controlled to a constant value is out of this<br>
range, a cycle of wire feed speed Wf will be disturbed.<br>
If a short circuit occurs at time t4, deceleration of wire feed speed<br>
Wf is resumed from the control at constant value (first feed speed Wf1).<br>
The predetermined cyclic wire feed speed is resumed. On and after time<br>
t4, the feed speed decelerates, and soon feeding changes from forward<br>
feed to backward feed. At time t5, the short circuit is opened, and arc is<br>
regenerated.<br>
With this operation, a droplet at the wire end will not grow by<br>
changing wire feeding from forward feed to backward feed, even if<br>
generation of a short circuit is delayed due to longer distance between the<br>
tip and base material at timing A. In addition, a short circuit can be<br>
generated earlier compared to the case of not setting a constant value to<br>
wire feed speed Wf. Disturbance of short-circuit cycle, in line with<br>
reduction of spatter generation and longer short circuit period, is<br>
suppressed. Stability of arc can thus be enhanced. The consumable<br>
electrode arc welding control method in this exemplary embodiment<br>
repeats the above cycle of short circuit period and arc period.<br>
Next is described an arc welding device for the aforementioned<br>
control of consumable electrode arc welding with reference to Fig. 1. In<br>
Fig. 1, welding voltage detector 9 is connected between welding power<br>
output terminals 14a and 14b, and outputs a signal corresponding to<br>
detected voltage. Short circuit/arc detector 10 determines whether weld<br>
output voltage Vw is less or not less than a constant value based on the<br>
signal from welding voltage detector 9. Based on this determination<br>
 <br>
result, the short circuit state, in which wire 16 is making contact and<br>
generating short circuit with base material 15 that is a workpiece, or the<br>
arc state, in which wire 16 is not making contact, is determined and a<br>
determination signal is output.<br>
Next is described the wire feed control after short circuit/arc<br>
detector 10 makes determination. Wire feed speed controller 13 outputs<br>
to wire feeder 19 a signal for controlling the speed at predetermined cyclic<br>
wire feed speed Wf, so as to control wire feed speed Wf. This cyclic<br>
waveform may be sinusoidal, as shown in Fig. 2, or trapezoidal as long as<br>
cyclic form is achieved. Wire feed speed controller 13 includes memory<br>
21 that stores a formula or table including set current, average feed speed<br>
of wire feed speed Wf, frequency of wire feed speed, and amplitude of wire<br>
feed speed Wf in a linked manner; and wire feed speed determinator 22<br>
that determines the average feed speed of wire feed speed Wf, frequency<br>
of wire feed speed Wf, and amplitude of wire feed speed Wf with reference<br>
to memory 21 based on the set current set in welding condition setting<br>
unit 12. In this way, wire feed speed controller 13 controls wire feeding<br>
by outputting to wire feeder 19 a signal that repetitively controls the cycle<br>
of forward feed and backward feed of wire feed speed Wf upon receiving<br>
an output of short circuit/arc detector 10 and an output of wire feed speed<br>
determinator 22.<br>
Next is described, the welding output control of welding current<br>
Aw and welding voltage Vw. Output controller 11 outputs a signal for<br>
controlling welding current or welding voltage with reference to an<br>
appropriate parameter for the short circuit period, in case of the short<br>
 <br>
circuit period, based on a weld waveform parameter selected depending<br>
on the set welding current and set welding current set by an operator via<br>
welding condition setting unit 12. In case of arc period, output controller<br>
11 outputs a signal for controlling welding current or welding voltage<br>
with reference to an appropriate parameter for the arc period. These<br>
output signals are input to switching element 4 to control the welding<br>
output.<br>
Now, the operation is described below when the distance between<br>
the tip and base material becomes longer, which is external disturbance,<br>
in the arc period. If wire feed speed controller 13 does not receive a<br>
signal indicating generation of short circuit from short circuit/arc detector<br>
10 before the wire feed speed is decelerated to predetermined first feed<br>
speed Wf1 in forward feed, as shown Fig. 2, during the deceleration period<br>
in forward wire feed, wire feed speed controller 13 suspends the<br>
predetermined cyclic deceleration control, and switches from the cyclic<br>
control to the constant-value control at first feed speed Wfl. Wire feed<br>
speed controller 13 outputs a control signal to wire feeder 19 to feed wire<br>
16 at a constant speed. This constant wire feeding at first feed speed<br>
Wfl continues until a short circuit is generated and wire feed speed<br>
controller 13 receives a short-circuit detection signal from short circuit/arc<br>
detector 10.<br>
Since first feed speed Wfl is a predetermined forward feed value,<br>
short circuit is soon generated. Wire feed speed controller 13 thus<br>
receives the short-circuit detection signal from short circuit /arc detector<br>
10. Then, wire feed speed controller 13 switches from the constant-value<br>
 <br>
control at first feed speed Wfl to the predetermined cyclic control, and the<br>
cyclic control is resumed to restart deceleration based on a cyclic speed<br>
command. Output controller 11 appropriately controls welding current<br>
and welding voltage in the short circuit period until the short circuit is<br>
opened.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, a value for waiting generation of<br>
short circuit, i.e., timing to stop changing wire feed speed Wf cyclically<br>
and switching to the constant-value control at first feed speed Wfl, is set<br>
to timing when the wire feed speed becomes first feed speed Wfl.<br>
However, a predetermined angle (e.g., 110° if an angle of first feed speed<br>
Wfl is 90°) may be set when one cycle of wire feed speed is angle of 360°.<br>
Wire feed speed Wf may be controlled to change from cyclic wire feed<br>
speed Wf to constant speed if short circuit is not generated before this<br>
angle. Alternatively, a value for waiting generation of short circuit, i.e.,<br>
timing to stop changing wire feed speed Wf cyclically, may be a time point<br>
when a predetermined time passes from opening the short circuit or a<br>
time point when a predetermined time passes from a time point at which<br>
the wire feed speed reaches first feed speed Wfl.<br>
As described above, in this exemplary embodiment, a droplet at<br>
the wire end does not grow by backward feed of wire 16 even if generation<br>
of a short circuit is delayed due to external disturbance such as extended<br>
distance between the tip and base material in the deceleration period at<br>
forward wire feed speed during arc generation. And, early generation of<br>
a short circuit can be encouraged during forward feed. Accordingly, the<br>
exemplary embodiment can better stabilize arc by reducing spatter<br>
 <br>
generation, and suppressing variations in the short circuit cycle and the<br>
number of short circuits due to extended interval between short circuits.<br>
(SECOND EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT)<br>
Parts that are same as the first exemplary embodiment are given<br>
the same reference marks to omit duplicate detailed description in this<br>
exemplary embodiment. Major difference from the first exemplary<br>
embodiment is the control of wire feed speed Wf when arc is not generated<br>
during backward wire feed in the short circuit period between generation<br>
of short circuit and generation of arc.<br>
Fig. 1 used in the first exemplary embodiment shows a schematic<br>
diagram of a consumable electrode arc welding device also applicable to<br>
this exemplary embodiment. Fig. 3 shows waveforms of a wire feed<br>
speed, welding voltage, and welding current when welding takes place<br>
adopting a consumable electrode arc welding control method in this<br>
exemplary embodiment.<br>
Time tl in Fig. 3 is within the arc period where arc is generated.<br>
Outputs of welding voltage Vw and welding current Aw are controlled to<br>
form an appropriate droplet in order to smoothly transfer the droplet at a<br>
wire end in a coming short circuit period. Wire feed speed Wf is<br>
controlled cyclically according to a predetermined command value. The<br>
wire feed speed is accelerated at time tl.<br>
In the short circuit period from time t2 to time t3, the wire is fed<br>
according to the predetermined command value, and outputs of welding<br>
current Aw and welding voltage Vw are appropriately controlled in the<br>
 <br>
short circuit period. The output control is the same as that described in<br>
the first exemplary embodiment. Then, at time t3, the short circuit is<br>
opened, and arc is regenerated. In this way, welding takes place by<br>
repetition of generation of short circuit and regeneration of arc.<br>
At time t4, a short circuit occurs again. Wire 16 is fed cyclically<br>
according to the predetermined command value, and outputs of welding<br>
current Aw and welding voltage Vw are appropriately controlled in the<br>
short circuit period. However, lets say external disturbance such as a<br>
shorter distance between tip 20 and base material 15 occurs at timing B<br>
in this short circuit period, typically due to positional deviation in<br>
placement of base material 15 that is a workpiece, and base material 15<br>
becomes closer to an end of tip 20. In this case, the short circuit<br>
continues without being opened.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, acceleration is stopped and wire 16<br>
is fed at a constant value of second feed speed Wf3, so as to suppress<br>
continuation of short circuit without being opened, if the short circuit is<br>
not opened at a time point when the wire feed speed reaches second feed<br>
speed Wf3 during acceleration from minimum speed Wf4 in backward<br>
feed. Since second feed speed Wf3 is a value for backward feed, the wire<br>
can be certainly drawn up to open the short circuit. Accordingly, this<br>
exemplary embodiment can suppress splattering of wire portion,<br>
increased spatter, or adhesion of the wire end and base material that may<br>
occur during short-circuiting if the process moves onto forward feed<br>
without opening the short circuit, as described in a disadvantage of the<br>
prior art.<br>
 <br>
Timing for opening a short circuit can be made earlier by setting a<br>
lower value (higher in a negative absolute value) for second feed speed<br>
Wf3. Accordingly, lower second feed speed Wf3 is better for earlier<br>
timing of opening the short circuit. However, second feed speed Wf3 is<br>
preferably not as low as minimum speed (Wf4). This is because if the<br>
distance between the tip and base material is constant when no<br>
disturbance occurs, the short circuit is opened at timing when a value of<br>
wire feed speed Wf is around minimum speed Wf4 (roughly within ±1/8<br>
cycle). Therefore, the short circuit may be often opened after<br>
acceleration starts from minimum speed Wf4.<br>
If the distance between the tip and base material is constant, there<br>
is no influence on generation of next short circuit or a short-circuit cycle<br>
even if the timing of short circuit deviates around minimum speed Wf4<br>
(for about ±1/8 cycle). Therefore, there will be no problem if the wire is<br>
fed cyclically at wire feed speed Wf according to the predetermined<br>
command value. However, for example, if a value of second feed speed<br>
Wf3 is set to the same value as minimum speed Wf4, the wire feed speed<br>
will be controlled to a constant value to open the short circuit in all cases<br>
when the short circuit is opened at timings after minimum speed Wf4.<br>
This will disturb the cycle of wire feed speed. This disturbance of cycle<br>
leads to variations in the cyclic nature of generation and opening of short<br>
circuit, or the number of short circuits. Welding results thus become<br>
unstable. Accordingly, a threshold wire feed speed for controlling the<br>
feed speed to the constant value when the short circuit is not opened is<br>
 <br>
preferably set to the wire feed speed at the time point roughly about 1/8<br>
cycle after minimum feed speed Wf 4.<br>
If the short circuit is opened at time t5, wire feed speed Wf is<br>
switched from the constant-value control at second feed speed Wf3 to the<br>
cyclic control. The acceleration control is then resumed, and the<br>
predetermined cyclic wire feed speed is resumed. Since the wire feed<br>
speed is accelerated, wire feeding transfers from backward feed to<br>
forward feed as time passes, and a short circuit is generated.<br>
The above control suppresses adhesion of the wire end and base<br>
material or splatter and causes early opening of the short circuit even if<br>
opening of the short circuit is delayed due to shorter distance between the<br>
tip and base material at timing B. Accordingly, stability of arc can be<br>
enhanced by reducing spatter generation and also reducing disturbance of<br>
the short-circuit cycle.<br>
The consumable electrode arc welding control method in this<br>
exemplary embodiment repeats the above cycle of short circuit period and<br>
arc period.<br>
Next is described, with reference to Fig. 1, an arc welding device<br>
for the aforementioned control of consumable electrode arc welding when<br>
a distance between the tip and base material becomes shorter during the<br>
short circuit period. As shown in Fig. 3, wire feed speed controller 13<br>
switches the wire feed speed from predetermined cyclic acceleration<br>
control to constant-value control at second feed speed Wf3, and outputs<br>
this control to wire feeder 19 when a short-circuit opening signal is not<br>
input from short circuit/arc detector 10 before acceleration of the wire feed<br>
 <br>
speed reaches second feed speed Wf3 in backward feed. The constant<br>
feed control at second feed speed Wf3 is then applied until the short<br>
circuit is opened.<br>
Since second feed speed Wf3 is a predetermined backward feed<br>
value, the short circuit is soon opened, and wire feed speed controller 13<br>
receives an opening detection signal from short circuit/arc detector 10.<br>
Wire feed speed controller 13 then resumes the acceleration control of<br>
wire feed speed Wf4 according to the predetermined cyclic speed<br>
command from the constant-value control at second feed speed Wf3. In<br>
the arc period, output controller 11 controls welding current and welding<br>
voltage appropriate for the arc period until next generation of short<br>
circuit.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, a value for waiting opening of<br>
short circuit, i.e., timing to stop changing cyclic wire feed speed Wf, is set<br>
at second feed speed Wf3. However, a predetermined angle (e.g. 300° if<br>
an angle of minimum speed Wf4 is 270°) may be set when one cycle of<br>
wire feed speed is an angle of 360°. Alternatively, a value for waiting<br>
Qpening of short circuit, i.e., timing to stop changing the wire feed speed<br>
cyclically, may be a time point when a predetermined time passes from<br>
occurrence of short circuit, or a time point when a predetermined time<br>
passes from the time point at which the wire feed speed reaches minimum<br>
speed Wf4.<br>
As described above, the consumable electrode arc welding device<br>
and the consumable electrode arc welding control method in this<br>
exemplary embodiment can prevent adhesion of the wire end and base<br>
 <br>
material, suppresses splatter, and encourages early opening of short<br>
circuit even if opening of short circuit is delayed due to shorter distance<br>
between the tip and base material in the acceleration period at the<br>
backward wire feed speed. This reduces spatter generation and also<br>
reduces variations in the short circuit cycle and number of short circuits.<br>
Accordingly, stability of arc can be enhanced.<br>
(THIRD EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT)<br>
Parts that are same as the first and second exemplary<br>
embodiments are given the same reference marks to omit duplicate<br>
detailed description. Major difference from the first and second<br>
exemplary embodiments is the control of wire feed speed to achieve a<br>
predetermined average wire feed speed for each set welding current by<br>
calculating an average wire feed speed for every cycle of cyclic wire feed<br>
speed.<br>
Fig. 1 used in the first and second exemplary embodiments show a<br>
structure also applicable to a consumable electrode arc welding device in<br>
this exemplary embodiment. Fig. 4 shows waveforms of a wire feed<br>
speed and average feed speed when welding takes place adopting the<br>
consumable electrode arc welding control method in this exemplary<br>
embodiment.<br>
A dotted line of Wfsl in Fig. 4 shows a reference average feed<br>
speed that is set for each set welding current. As described later, this is<br>
set based on set current. Reference average feed speed Wfsl is preset to<br>
that equivalent to an average value of cyclically changing wire feed speed.<br>
 <br>
To respond to unexpected external disturbance, such as change of<br>
distance between the tip and base material, in the middle of welding, as<br>
described in the first and second exemplary embodiments, a cyclic change<br>
of wire feed speed is stopped, and wire feeding is controlled at a constant<br>
speed different from the cyclic wire feed speed. This changes the average<br>
value of wire feed speed, and the average feed speed becomes different<br>
from aforementioned reference average feed speed set for each set welding<br>
current.<br>
For example, external disturbance has not occurred until a time<br>
point of time t6 in Fig. 4. The wire is thus fed cyclically at the<br>
predetermined cyclic wire feed speed. The average wire feed speed until<br>
time t6 is equivalent to reference average feed speed Wfsl. However,<br>
external disturbance shown in the first exemplary embodiment occurs in<br>
the next cycle (from time t6 to t7). If the feed control described in the<br>
first exemplary embodiment is executed, time for controlling the wire feed<br>
speed at a constant value of first feed speed Wf4 until a short circuit<br>
occurs increases, and an average wire feed speed for one cycle from time<br>
t6 to t7 becomes Wfol, which is AWfl higher than reference average feed<br>
speed Wfsl. An increase of the average feed speed increases wire feed<br>
amount, and this increased feeding is AWfl x Atl against preset wire feed<br>
amount. This increased feed amount increases weld amount, and thus<br>
bead width broadens and bead height becomes taller. Amount of weld<br>
penetration also increases. If external disturbance further continues and<br>
the number of increases continue, the wire weld amount further increases,<br>
 <br>
and the bead width, bead height, or penetration depth increases. This<br>
may cause burn-through, giving detrimental effect on welding results.<br>
To suppress this detrimental effect, an average of the wire feed<br>
speed is controlled and set to predetermined reference average feed speed<br>
Wfsl from time t7 so that the aforementioned increase in the wire feed<br>
speed in the next cycle (At2) can be balanced. More specifically, the wire<br>
feed speed in the next one cycle (At2) is set to the feed speed shifted in<br>
parallel to the lower-speed direction so that the average wire feed speed<br>
becomes Wfs2 obtained by subtracting AWf2 (= (AWfl x Atl)/ At2), which<br>
is the increase divided by the time of next one cycle, from predetermined<br>
reference average feed speed Wfsl. The wire feed speed is controlled by<br>
shifting in parallel the average feed speed, i.e., the center position of<br>
amplitude, to the lower-speed direction without changing the amplitude<br>
and frequency.<br>
With this control, even if the average wire feed speed increases to<br>
the predetermined reference average wire feed speed due to temporal<br>
change of wire feed speed against external disturbance, this increase can<br>
be balanced in the next one cycle, and the speed returns to the<br>
predetermined reference average wire feed speed. Accordingly, the<br>
welding results are not affected, and satisfactory weld bead can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Contrary, if the average wire feed speed decreases due to a shorter<br>
distance between the tip and base material, as shown in the second<br>
exemplary embodiment, the wire feed speed in the next one cycle is<br>
increased to balance the decrease.<br>
 <br>
If the increase or decrease is too large to balance only by the next<br>
one cycle, the increase or decrease may be balanced using multiple cycles,<br>
such as two cycles or three cycles.<br>
As described above, this exemplary embodiment controls the<br>
average wire feed speed of wire feed speed to the predetermined reference<br>
average wire feed speed in the next cycle or the next multiple cycles even<br>
if the average feed speed of the wire feed speed is changed to reduce any<br>
increase in spatter generation or unstable arc due to unexpected external<br>
disturbance occurred in the middle of welding, as described in the first<br>
and second exemplary embodiments. Accordingly, any effect on the bead<br>
width , bead height, or penetration depth can be suppressed.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The arc welding control method and device of the present<br>
invention can reduce spatter and improve stability of arc by controlling<br>
the wire feed speed even if external disturbance such as change of<br>
distance between the tip and base material occurs during welding.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is industrially effective to methods and<br>
devices for arc welding that successively feeds the welding wire that is a<br>
consumable electrode.<br>

wherein<br>
the wire feed speed controller stops the cyclic change and starts a<br>
constant control of the wire feed speed at a second feed speed if a short<br>
circuit is not opened during acceleration of the wire feed speed in the<br>
backward feed of the welding wire before one of the wire feed speed<br>
reaching a predetermined feed speed, a predetermined time passing from<br>
short, circuit generation, and a feed cycle of the welding wire reaching a<br>
predetermined angle when one feed cycle of the welding wire is expressed<br>
by angle; and if the short circuit is opened during the backward feed at<br>
the second feed speed, acceleration from the second feed speed starts and<br>
the cyclic change is resumed for welding.<br>
12. The consumable electrode arc welding device of one of claims<br>
10 and 11, wherein the wire feed speed controller calculates an average<br>
cyclic wire feed speed of a cycle for each cycle; if the average cyclic wire<br>
feed speed of one cycle is lower than an average wire feed speed, welding<br>
takes place at the wire feed speed shifted in parallel to a higher speed<br>
 <br>
than the average wire feed speed so that the average cyclic wire feed<br>
speed of a cycle on and after a next cycle of the one cycle becomes higher<br>
than the average wire feed speed, the wire feed speed being an average<br>
cyclic wire feed speed on and after the next cycle; and if the average cyclic<br>
wire feed speed of the one cycle is higher than the average wire feed speed,<br>
welding takes place at the wire feed speed shifted in parallel to a lower<br>
speed than the average wire feed so that the average cyclic wire feed<br>
speed of the cycle on and after the next cycle of the one cycle becomes<br>
lower than the average wire feed speed, the wire feed speed being the<br>
average cyclic wire feed speed pn and after the next cycle.<br>
 <br>
If a short circuit does not occur during deceleration of a wire feed<br>
speed in forward feed of a welding wire before the wire feed speed reaches<br>
a predetermined wire feed speed, a cyclic change is stopped and the wire<br>
feed speed is constantly controlled at the first feed speed. If a short<br>
circuit occurs during forward feed at the first feed speed, deceleration<br>
from the first feed speed starts, and the cyclic change is resumed for<br>
welding. This achieves uniform weld bead without increasing spatters<br>
even if any external disturbance such as change of distance between a tip<br>
and base material occurs.</td>
