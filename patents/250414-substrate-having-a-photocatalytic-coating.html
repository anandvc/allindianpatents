				<td>SUBSTRATE HAVING A PHOTOCATALYTIC COATING<br>
The present invention relates to at least<br>
partially transparent substrates provided with a<br>
photocatalytic coating, the method for obtaining such a<br>
coating, the products obtained, and the various<br>
applications of said products.<br>
It relates more particularly to substrates<br>
having both an antireflection function and a<br>
photocatalytic coating.<br>
The coatings of the invention thereby serve to<br>
confer novel functionalities on the materials<br>
supporting them, by particularly combining anti-<br>
soiling, fungicidal or bactericidal properties with<br>
light reflection reduction properties.<br>
The substrates of the present invention are<br>
transparent or semitransparent, inorganic or organic,<br>
substrates such as glasses or glass-ceramics or various<br>
rigid or flexible polymers.<br>
In fields as varied as glazing for shop windows<br>
or counters, windows for automobiles such as<br>
windshields, or ophthalmic lenses, a need has appeared<br>
in recent years to decrease the light reflectance.<br>
This need stems from essentially esthetic reasons,<br>
particularly in the case of shop or museum windows,<br>
when it is important to highlight the objects located<br>
behind the windows, or in the case of ophthalmic<br>
lenses. In the latter case, the use of antireflection<br>
films is vitally important because, owing to the<br>
steadily decreasing thickness of the lenses, high<br>
refractive index (and therefore high reflectance)<br>
polymers are increasingly employed. Safety reasons may<br>
also justify the need to decrease the light reflectance<br>
of the transparent substrates: this is the case, for<br>
example, for automotive glazing, particularly<br>
windshields, to avoid the driver being disturbed by<br>
undesirable reflections which may be substantial,<br>
particularly in the case of light-colored dashboards.<br>
The need may finally be justified for functional<br>
reasons, for example in the case of glazing covering<br>
photovoltaic cells of solar panels generating<br>
electricity. In this case, any increase in the<br>
transmittance of the glazing (for example by decreasing<br>
the intensity of the reflected rays) procures a<br>
substantial energy gain.<br>
Miscellaneous coatings have been developed to<br>
meet this need, both with inorganic and organic<br>
substrates. They are designed to decrease the light<br>
reflectance of a given substrate, or even to eliminate<br>
it in certain cases. In general, a coating is<br>
considered to have an antireflection function when it<br>
has a lower reflectance than that of the uncoated<br>
substrate.<br>
The physical principle common to these coatings<br>
consists in creating various interfaces giving rise to<br>
multiple reflections which mainly interfere<br>
destructively.<br>
Such coatings for ophthalmic lenses are, for<br>
example, described in patent application FR 2 721 720.<br>
They may be rudimentary, consisting of a single film of<br>
dielectric materials of which the optical thickness<br>
(that is the product of the geometric thickness<br>
multiplied by the refractive index of the material) is<br>
equal to A/4, where X is a wavelength averaged in the<br>
visible range, hence around 550 nm. In this case, a<br>
low light reflectance is only obtained for almost<br>
normal incidences of the light ray. For the other<br>
angles of incidence, reflected colors varying with the<br>
angle of incidence or observation attest to the only<br>
partially destructive nature of the interference<br>
created. Antireflection coatings may also be more<br>
complex and comprise at least 3 or 4 layers to improve<br>
these esthetic aspects. They may also be required to<br>
meet stringent specifications in terms of mechanical or<br>
thermomechanical strength or abrasion resistance.<br>
Patent application FR 2 841 894 accordingly describes<br>
antireflection coatings intended for glazing having to<br>
undergo bending treatments, therefore high mechanical<br>
loads at high temperatures. These coatings consist of<br>
a stack of at least four layers, with layers having a<br>
high refractive index alternating with layers having a<br>
low index, each layer also having a clearly defined<br>
optical thickness.<br>
The major drawback of this type of coating<br>
stems from the fact that their optical effect is<br>
extremely affected by dirt, particularly organic dirt.<br>
In other words, it has appeared that these<br>
antireflection coatings make the dirt much more<br>
visible, even if the dirt is very thin, because it<br>
alters the optical path of the reflected rays by adding<br>
undesirable interfaces, thereby disturbing the<br>
interference effects. Thus, organic pollution of the<br>
"fingerprint" type, is particularly revealed by the<br>
antireflection coatings, for example on ophthalmic<br>
lenses or shop counters.<br>
Simultaneous with research conducted on<br>
antireflection coatings, anti-soiling coatings have<br>
also been emerging within the last 10 years, chiefly<br>
based on the photocatalytic activity of titanium<br>
dioxide. Titanium dioxide, particularly when it is<br>
crystalline, at least partially, in the "anatase"<br>
crystallographic form, serves, under the effect of<br>
radiation, particularly ultraviolet radiation, to<br>
catalyze the oxidation by free radical reactions, and<br>
hence the degradation, of organic molecules. The<br>
underlying physical mechanism is the creation of an<br>
electron-hole pair under the effect of the radiation<br>
whereof the energy is greater than or equal to the<br>
energy "gap" between the valence and conduction bands<br>
of titanium dioxide. These coatings, described for<br>
example in application EP 850 204, also have<br>
photoinduced hydrophilic properties conferring self-<br>
cleaning functions on the material. The surface made<br>
hydrophilic in fact allows for easy cleaning, both of<br>
organic waste and inorganic dust, for example by<br>
rainwater. This hydrophilic property also confers an<br>
anti-fogging effect on the material, the water having a<br>
tendency to coat the material in the form of a<br>
transparent film rather than form droplets.<br>
Photocatalytic titanium dioxide coatings can be<br>
formed by various deposition methods, for example, by<br>
chemical vapor deposition (CVD), (as described in<br>
abovementioned application EP 850 204), by the cathode<br>
sputtering method (application FR 2 814 094 presents a<br>
particular method thereof), or by '"sol-gel" processes.<br>
The titanium dioxide may be partly introduced<br>
in the form of nanoscale crystalline particles embedded<br>
in an inorganic or organic binder as described in<br>
application FR 2 738 812, or it may be created in situ<br>
as in abovementioned application FR 2 814 094. Another<br>
means is to use the sol-gel process to deposit a<br>
mesoporous coating comprising at least partially<br>
crystalline titanium dioxide, particularly in the form<br>
of perfectly discernible particles. This particular<br>
method, described in application FR 2 838 734, confers<br>
increased photocatalytic activity on the product<br>
obtained.<br>
An example of the combination of the two anti-<br>
soiling and antireflection functions in the same<br>
material is described in document EP-A-1 291 331, in<br>
which titanium dioxide films less than 100 nanometers<br>
thick deposited by the magnetron sputtering process<br>
overlay stacks of layers. After the deposition,<br>
production of the anatase phase, which improves the<br>
photoinduced hydrophilic properties, is favored by heat<br>
treatment between 100 and 250°C. It has appeared,<br>
however, that these deposition conditions do not<br>
produce layers having a rapid rate of degradation of<br>
organic dirt. Moreover, the stacks described have very<br>
wide variations in reflectance properties according to<br>
the thickness of the photocatalytic coating, entailing<br>
the extremely accurate control of said thickness during<br>
the deposition of said coating. Finally, most of the<br>
stacks described contain at least one metal layer,<br>
which has the effect of sharply decreasing the light<br>
transmittance of the coated substrate. The stacks<br>
proposed, particularly those not comprising a metal<br>
layer, have a reflectance spectrum that is highly<br>
dependent on the wavelength and particularly<br>
reflectance values that are substantially higher than<br>
the reflectance of the uncoated glass for wavelengths<br>
of 400 nm and/or 700 nm.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to<br>
overcome these drawbacks and propose a material for<br>
rapidly removing organic dirt, under outdoor and indoor<br>
conditions, and having a low reflectance over the<br>
widest possible range of wavelengths. Another object<br>
of the invention is to propose a material such that the<br>
photocatalytic coating can be deposited by an<br>
economical method. A further object of the invention<br>
is to propose a material having good chemical<br>
resistance and mechanical strength.<br>
The principal subject of the invention is a<br>
transparent or semitransparent substrate having, on at<br>
least part of at least one of its sides, a<br>
photocatalytic coating based on titanium dioxide, all<br>
the deposited coatings conferring an antireflection<br>
function on said substrate.<br>
In the context of the present invention,<br>
antireflection coating means a coating which, for the<br>
coated side, confers a light reflectance lower than<br>
that conferred by an uncoated side of the substrate.<br>
The coating of the invention advantageously has<br>
high photocatalytic activity, defined as being an<br>
activity, under outdoor irradiation conditions (kext),<br>
expressed as the rate of degradation of stearic acid,<br>
which is greater than or equal to 1 x 10-2 cn-1/min.<br>
The total light reflectance for the coated side<br>
of the material is preferably lower than or equal to<br>
80%, particularly to 60%, and even to 40%, indeed to<br>
20% or 15%, of the reflectance of an uncoated side of<br>
the substrate. According to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the reflectance of a coated side is<br>
lower than the reflectance of an uncoated side of the<br>
substrate over the entire 400-800 nm range,<br>
corresponding to the range of wavelengths of visible<br>
radiation.<br>
In the case of a soda-lime-silica glass, the<br>
reflectance of each side is about 4%. The coating of<br>
the invention hence preferably provides a reflectance<br>
per side that is lower than or equal to 3.2%,<br>
particularly to 2.4%, indeed to 1.6%, and even to 0.8<br>
or 0.6%. When both sides of the material are coated<br>
according to the invention, the total reflectance in<br>
the case of a soda-lime-silica glass substrate may<br>
therefore be lower than or equal to 1.2%.<br>
The substrate may be inorganic, for example,<br>
glass or glass-ceramic, or organic. In the latter<br>
case, various rigid or flexible plastics can be<br>
employed, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA),<br>
polycarbonate (PC), polypropylene, polyurethane,<br>
polyvinyl butyral, polyethylene glycol terephthalate,<br>
polybutylene glycol terephthalate, ionomer resin such<br>
as ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid copolymer neutralized by<br>
a polyamine, cycloolefine copolymer such as<br>
ethylene/norbornene or ethylene/cyclopentadiene<br>
copolymers, polycarbonate/polyester copolymer,<br>
ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer and similar polymers,<br>
alone or in blends thereof. More specifically in the<br>
field of ophthalmic lenses, the substrates employed can<br>
also be obtained by polymerization of bis-diethylene<br>
glycol allylcarbonate (available under the trademark<br>
CR39® from PPG Industries Inc.), or may be substrates<br>
based on (meth)allylic or (meth)acrylic polymer, (more<br>
particularly those obtained from monomers or<br>
prepolymers derived from bisphenol A, used alone or in<br>
blends with other copolymerizable monomers), based on<br>
polythiourethane, or based on polystyrene or diallyl<br>
phthalate resin.<br>
Since pure titanium dioxide is one of the<br>
materials having the highest refractive index<br>
(respectively 2.75 and 2.57 for the rutile and anatase<br>
crystallographic forms), a person skilled in the art is<br>
not encouraged to envisage the combination of the<br>
photocatalytic and antireflection effects. This<br>
combination is considered as incompatible, because the<br>
high refractive index layers will destroy the<br>
antireflection function, or at least degrade it<br>
substantially. In the context of the present<br>
invention, the inventors have selected preferential<br>
embodiments in which the photocatalytic coating has a<br>
refractive index lower than 2, preferably lower than<br>
1.9, indeed than 1.8, and particularly lower than 1.7,<br>
indeed than 1.6. In a particularly preferred manner,<br>
the refractive index of the photocatalytic coating is<br>
even lower than or equal to 1.5. In this way, it has<br>
proved to be surprisingly feasible to obtain a true<br>
combination of the photocatalytic and antireflection<br>
functions, in which the reflectance of the material<br>
remains lower than the reflectance of the uncoated<br>
substrate. This differs from what is known from the<br>
prior art, in which intermediate layers are sometimes<br>
placed under the photocatalytic coating for the sole<br>
purpose of attenuating the light reflectance thereby,<br>
without however obtaining a lower reflectance than that<br>
of the bare substrate.<br>
For an application in the optical and<br>
ophthalmic field, it is also preferable for the<br>
photocatalytic activity to be extremely intense, so<br>
that the dirt can only disturb the view for a very<br>
short time. This is particularly preferable in the<br>
case of persons who spend most of their time indoors,<br>
where exposure to sunlight, particularly in the<br>
ultraviolet (UV) range is low. Outdoors, the average<br>
intensity of UVA radiation (in the 315-400 nm<br>
wavelength range) is, for example, about 50 W for an<br>
irradiated area of 1 m2; it drops to less than 2 W/m2<br>
indoors, particularly because of the filtering power of<br>
the glazing.<br>
The substrate of the invention is therefore<br>
preferably coated with a photocatalytic coating whereof<br>
the activity under outdoor irradiation conditions<br>
(kext), expressed as the rate of stearic acid<br>
degradation, is higher than or equal to 1 x 10-2,<br>
particularly 2 x 10-2, indeed 3 x 10-2 cm-1/min, and even<br>
3.5 x 10-2 cm-1/min.<br>
The photocatalytic coating advantageously has,<br>
under indoor irradiation conditions, an activity (kint),<br>
expressed as a weight percentage of stearic acid<br>
degraded after two hours of irradiation, greater than<br>
15%, particularly greater than 20%, and preferably<br>
greater than 30%, indeed 40%, and even 50%.<br>
The rate of stearic acid degradation expresses<br>
the rate of decrease of the area of the stretching<br>
vibration bands of the CH2-CH3 groups measured by<br>
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) under<br>
conditions described in detail below.<br>
The conditions for measuring the photocatalytic<br>
activity, both under indoor and outdoor lighting<br>
conditions, are given in detail in the description of<br>
the examples according to the invention.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the photocatalytic coating is characterized<br>
by a mesoporous structure, preferably produced by the<br>
sol-gel process, comprising at least partially<br>
crystalline titanium dioxide, particularly in anatase<br>
and/or rutile form. The mesoporous structure serves,<br>
in fact, to substantially increase the specific surface<br>
area of the material, thereby considerably increasing<br>
the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, porous, and<br>
hence low-density inorganic materials generally have a<br>
low refractive index, which is lower as the porosity<br>
increases.<br>
The term "mesoporous" refers here to pores with<br>
diameters of between 2 and 50 nm. The mesoporous<br>
structure is based on at least one compound of at least<br>
one of the elements Si, W, Sb, Ti, Zr, Ta, V, B, Pb,<br>
Mg, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, Sn, Zn, In, Fe and Mo, if possible<br>
in a covalent bond with elements such as O, S, N, C.<br>
With the exception of titanium dioxide, the<br>
mesoporous structure preferably consists mainly of<br>
silica (SiO2), to confer a low overall refractive index<br>
on the coating according to the invention.<br>
When the mesoporous structure contains silica,<br>
it has appeared advantageous to the inventors to select<br>
a coating having a Ti/Si atomic ratio preferably of<br>
between 0.25 and 2, particularly between 0.6 and 1.2,<br>
indeed substantially equal to 1. The coatings having<br>
low Ti/Si ratios do not in fact have the desired<br>
photocatalytic properties, whereas the high Ti/Si<br>
ratios confer higher refractive indexes on the<br>
material.<br>
The pore network, advantageously obtained using<br>
organic structuring agents, preferably has a medium- or<br>
long-range order (a few nanometers to a few microns).<br>
The at least partially crystalline titanium<br>
dioxide is, for example, incorporated into the<br>
mesoporous structure in the form of perfectly<br>
discernible particles. It is optionally doped or<br>
combined with other materials to increase the<br>
photocatalytic activity or to create a more intense<br>
activity in the visible wavelength range (as explained<br>
in applications WO 97/10185 and WO 97/10186<br>
incorporated here for reference), and comprises<br>
nanoparticles having diameters of between 0.5 and 100<br>
nm, particularly between 1 and 80 nm, themselves<br>
consisting of clusters of grains or elementary<br>
crystallites having diameters of between 0.5 and 10 nm.<br>
The term "diameter" should be considered here in the<br>
broad sense, and is rather an evaluation of the size of<br>
the nanoparticle or the crystallite. The shape thereof<br>
may approach a sphere, or an elongated rice grain shape<br>
or a completely random shape. The overall mesoporous<br>
structure incorporating the titanium dioxide is<br>
essentially solid, having good cohesion, and excellent<br>
mechanical strength and abrasion resistance. The<br>
mesoporous structure may be composed exclusively of<br>
titanium or a titanium compound such as its oxide,<br>
particularly crystallized in anatase and/or rutile<br>
form. It has proved that the titanium dioxide thus<br>
incorporated exerts its photocatalytic activity to an<br>
exceptionally high degree. Thus a residual ultraviolet<br>
radiation, after having passed through a single or<br>
multiple glazing, or a residual ultraviolet radiation<br>
issuing from an indoor electrical lighting fixture<br>
suffices for the substrate according to this preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention for it to degrade an<br>
organic waste, and for the latter then to be entrained<br>
in a relatively uniform liquid film that is formed as<br>
applicable on the substrate made hydrophilic by the<br>
radiation. The coating of the invention therefore<br>
combines the function of degradation of organic waste -<br>
by photocatalysis - and the removal of the organic and<br>
inorganic waste hydrophilic/oleophilic character<br>
under the effect of any liquid, such as condensation.<br>
The high performance procured by this preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention can perhaps be attributed<br>
at least partly to the interconnection of the pore<br>
network, providing good access of the pollution to the<br>
titanium dioxide particles, and also good diffusion in<br>
the coating of the species photogenerated at the<br>
surface of these particles.<br>
Furthermore, the abrasion resistance and<br>
durability of the photocatalytic activity to such a<br>
high degree are excellent. This preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention therefore also serves to preserve the<br>
porosity after abrasion, whereas abrasion would<br>
normally be expected to have the result of densifying<br>
the surface layer and hence ultimately causing a loss<br>
of the anti-soiling properties.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, a monolayer film or a multilayer stack is<br>
inserted between the substrate and the photocatalytic<br>
coating in order to reduce the light reflectance of the<br>
substrate of the invention more effectively.<br>
The multilayer stack preferably does not<br>
comprise a metal layer, particularly based on silver,<br>
titanium or platinum. The presence of these layers in<br>
fact sharply decreases the light transmittance of the<br>
coated substrate. The inventors have also determined<br>
that their presence lowers the mechanical strength and<br>
chemical resistance.<br>
The coating thus inserted preferably consists<br>
of thin dielectric layers having alternating high and<br>
low refractive indexes and comprising in succession:<br>
a first high-index layer 1, having a refractive<br>
index n1 of between 1.8 and 2.3 and a geometric<br>
thickness e1 of between 5 and 50 nm,<br>
a second low-index layer 2, having a refractive<br>
index n2 of between 1.35 and 1.65 and a geometric<br>
thickness e2 of between 10 and 60 nm,<br>
a third high-index layer 3, having a refractive<br>
index n3 of between 1.8 and 2.5 and a geometric<br>
thickness e3 of between 40 and 150 nm.<br>
The photocatalytic coating based on titanium<br>
dioxide accordingly constitutes a fourth layer, placed<br>
on layer 3. To optimize the antireflection properties<br>
of the overall coating, particularly to obtain very low<br>
reflectances, its geometric thickness e4 is preferably<br>
of between 40 and 150 nm.<br>
In the context of the invention, "layer" means<br>
either a single layer or a superimposition of layers in<br>
which each layer has the refractive index indicated and<br>
in which the sum of their geometric thicknesses also<br>
remains equal to the value indicated for the layer in<br>
question.<br>
In the context of the invention, the layers are<br>
made from a dielectric material, particularly of the<br>
oxide, nitride or oxynitride type of a metal or<br>
semiconductor element. However, it is possible for at<br>
least one of them to be modified to be slightly<br>
conducting, for example by doping a metal oxide, for<br>
example, to also confer an antistatic function on the<br>
antireflection stack.<br>
These preferable thickness and refractive index<br>
criteria serve to obtain an antireflection effect<br>
having a wide band of low light reflectance (that is,<br>
such that the coated side has a reflectance lower than<br>
the reflectance of an uncoated side of the substrate<br>
over the entire 400-800 nm range), also having a<br>
neutral color in transmission and good esthetics in<br>
reflection, regardless of the angle of incidence at<br>
which the substrate thus coated is observed.<br>
The most suitable materials for producing the<br>
first and/or third layer of the stack, having a high<br>
index, are based on metal oxide(s) selected from<br>
titanium dioxide (TiO2) , zinc oxide (ZnO), stannic oxide<br>
(SnO2), zirconium oxide (ZrO2), or mixed oxides of a<br>
plurality of these oxides, for example mixed tin-zinc<br>
oxides (SnxZnyOz) , mixed zinc-titanium dioxides (TiZnOx)<br>
or silicon-titanium dioxides (SixTiyOz), or titanium-<br>
zirconium oxides (TixZr(1-X)O2) . They may also be based<br>
on nitride(s) selected from silicon nitride (Si3N4)<br>
and/or aluminum nitride (A1N), or a mixed<br>
silicon/zirconium nitride (SiZrNx) . All these materials<br>
can optionally be doped to improve their chemical<br>
resistance and/or mechanical strength and/or electrical<br>
resistance properties.<br>
The most suitable materials for the second<br>
layer of the stack A, having a low index, are based on<br>
silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride and/or oxycarbide, or<br>
based on a mixed silicon aluminum oxide. Such a mixed<br>
oxide tends to have better durability, particularly<br>
chemical, than pure SiO2 (an example thereof is given in<br>
patent EP-791 562). The respective proportions of the<br>
two oxides can be adjusted to improve the anticipated<br>
durability without excessively increasing the<br>
rerractive index of the layer.<br>
To confer thermomechanical resistance<br>
properties on the material of the invention (for<br>
example to improve the bending resistance of glass for<br>
counters), the stack on which the photocatalytic<br>
coating is deposited is preferably prepared according<br>
to the teachings of patent FR 2 841 894 incorporated<br>
here for reference.<br>
In the context of the embodiment according to<br>
which the photocatalytic coating is formed by a sol-gel<br>
process, the coating or the stack inserted between the<br>
substrate and said photocatalytic coating is<br>
advantageously optimized so that variations in<br>
thickness of the photocatalytic coating, inherent in<br>
this type of process, do not substantially affect the<br>
value of the light reflectance.<br>
In general and to meet one of the objects of<br>
the invention, the coated substrate is advantageously<br>
such that the extent of the thickness range of said<br>
photocatalytic coating for which the reflectance of the<br>
coated substrate remains lower than the reflectance of<br>
the uncoated substrate (indeed lower than 80%, 60% or<br>
even 40% of this value) represents at least 15%, indeed<br>
25% and even 30% or 50% of the median value of this<br>
range. The advantage of this embodiment lies in a<br>
greater simplicity of deposition, since the thickness<br>
control does not need to be extremely precise. This<br>
advantage is particularly accentuated when the<br>
photocatalytic coating is obtained by the sol-gel<br>
process, for which it is difficult to fully control the<br>
thickness or to obtain a perfectly uniform thickness.<br>
A further object of the invention relates to<br>
the method for obtaining a substrate as described<br>
above, this method comprising the following steps in<br>
succession:<br>
the formation of a "sol" comprising at least one<br>
precursor of the material constituting the<br>
mesoporous structure of the coating and at least<br>
one organic structuring agent diluted in a<br>
solvent,<br>
a sol "maturing" step corresponding to the<br>
incipient precipitation of the precursor around<br>
the organic structuring agent and the growth of<br>
molecules derived from the precursor,<br>
the addition of optionally doped titanium dioxide<br>
nanoparticles or crystallites to the sol, whereof<br>
the characteristic sizes are comprised between 0.5<br>
and 100 nm,<br>
the application of the sol to at least one surface<br>
of the substrate to be coated,<br>
the removal of the solvent,<br>
the removal of the organic structuring agent.<br>
The sol preferably contains at least one oxide<br>
precursor, for example a hydrolyzable compound such as<br>
an alkoxide or a halide, and advantageously at least<br>
one precursor of silica (SiO2), such as, for example,<br>
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) or tetramethoxysilane (TMOS).<br>
The silica precursors preferably represent the<br>
majority, or even the totality of the precursors of the<br>
material of the mesoporous structure. It may also<br>
contain at least one titanium dioxide precursor, such<br>
as titanium tetrabutoxide or titanium tetraethoxide.<br>
The structuring agent is advantageously<br>
selected from cationic surfactants, preferably of the<br>
quaternary ammonium type, such as<br>
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or nonionic<br>
surfactants, such as di block or tri block copolymers<br>
based for example on ethylene or propylene oxide.<br>
The organic structuring agent can also be added<br>
after the sol preparation and maturing steps, the<br>
latter step allowing preliminary condensation of the<br>
precursor to favor the structuring of the oxide coating<br>
condensed on the support surface in wide dimensional<br>
ranges. Advantageous maturing conditions comprise the<br>
maintenance of the sol at a temperature of 40 to 60°C<br>
for a period of 30 min to 24 hours, the maturing time<br>
being shorter at higher temperature.<br>
The solvents used are preferably alcohols,<br>
particularly ethanol, which has the advantage of being<br>
nontoxic.<br>
The application of the sol to the substrate can<br>
be carried out by sol-gel deposition techniques well<br>
known to a person skilled in the art, like those<br>
described in patent application EP-A-850 204 already<br>
mentioned and incorporated here for reference, for<br>
example:<br>
spin coating (deposition on a rotating substrate),<br>
dip coating or dipping (immersion of the substrate<br>
in the sol then removal at a controlled rate),<br>
laminar coating,<br>
cell coating, the substrates to be coated forming<br>
a narrow cavity (or "cell") bounded by two<br>
substantially parallel sides filled with the sol<br>
to be deposited and then drained in a controlled<br>
manner,<br>
spray coating techniques (spray-gun, etc.).<br>
When the substrate is made from plastic, it is<br>
advisable for the steps after the application of the<br>
sol to at least one surface of the substrate to take<br>
place at temperatures below 150°C, preferably below<br>
100°C or even lower than or equal to 8 0°C, indeed 60°C,<br>
to avoid degrading the substrate and/or creating<br>
mechanical stresses that could weaken the substrate<br>
and/or the various coatings due to the wide difference<br>
in expansion coefficients between the organic and<br>
inorganic materials.<br>
In this context, one particularly preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention consists in consolidating<br>
the coating at temperatures of between 50 and 80°C, and,<br>
successively or simultaneously, removing said organic<br>
structuring agent not thermally, but through<br>
irradiation, for example under ultraviolet radiation.<br>
The presence of titanium dioxide with photocatalytic<br>
properties then proves to be capable of rapidly<br>
degrading the totality of the structuring agents.<br>
The inventors have discovered an additional<br>
advantage of these treatments carried out at low<br>
temperature, which confer higher porosity and hence<br>
higher photocatalytic activity on the coatings.<br>
Functional layers or stacks thereof can also be<br>
inserted between the substrate of the invention and the<br>
layers with an antireflection and photocatalytic<br>
function. They may consist of antistatic or thermal<br>
(low-emissivity, solar protection, etc.) functional<br>
layers, particularly selected based on a conducting<br>
material of the metal type (for example silver) or of<br>
the doped metal oxide type such as tin-doped indium<br>
oxide ITO, aluminum-doped zinc oxide ZAO, tin oxide<br>
doped with a halogen such as fluorine or with antimony.<br>
These layers may also have a hardness making<br>
them suitable for scratch-resistant or abrasion-<br>
resistant functions, particularly useful in the case of<br>
ophthalmic lenses. These layers may be organic or<br>
inorganic, or even hybrid organic/inorganic layers.<br>
In this latter family, mention can be made of hard<br>
abrasion-resistant coatings obtained by hardening a<br>
composition containing colloidal silica, optionally a<br>
crosslinking catalyst and a hydrolysate or a mixture of<br>
hydrolysates of silane compound (s) such as epoxidized<br>
alkoxysilanes and/or fluorinated alkylsilanes and/or<br>
nonepoxidized silanes. Particularly for ophthalmic<br>
applications, these abrasion-resistant layers are<br>
preferably deposited on or under a primary organic or<br>
hybrid impact-resistant layer, preferably based on<br>
polysiloxane.<br>
Finally, they may be layers intended, in the<br>
case of organic substrates, for protecting said<br>
substrates against the photocatalytic action of the<br>
titanium dioxide, or in the case of a substrate based<br>
on inorganic glass, for preventing the migration of<br>
alkali metal ions from the glass into the<br>
photocatalytic layer. In the former case, the sublayer<br>
is preferably based on silica (for example obtained by<br>
a sol-gel process) or may consist of the scratch-<br>
resistant or abrasion-resistant layer described in the<br>
previous paragraph. In the latter case, the sublayer<br>
is preferably based on silicon oxycarbide. These<br>
layers may also, if applicable, belong to the stack of<br>
layers intended to decrease the overall reflectance of<br>
the material.<br>
The substrate of the invention may also be a<br>
glazing having variable electrically controlled optical<br>
properties, such as electrochromic glazing, liquid<br>
crystal glazing for passing from a transparent state to<br>
a translucent state, or glazing made luminous by the<br>
insertion of a rare gas which may be the seat of light-<br>
emitting discharges, or light-emitting diodes.<br>
A further subject of the invention is the use<br>
of such coated substrates as glazing, museum or shop<br>
windows, aquarium glass, glazing for interior or urban<br>
furniture, ophthalmic lenses, glazing for display<br>
screens, glazing for solar panels producing heat and/or<br>
electricity, glazing for automobiles, ships or<br>
aircraft, mirrors, particularly for rearview mirrors<br>
and headlight optics for automobiles, lighting devices.<br>
The present invention will be better understood<br>
from a reading of the detailed description below of<br>
nonlimiting exemplary embodiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A clear soda-lime-silica glass substrate 4 mm<br>
thick and sold by Saint-Gobain Glass under the trade<br>
name SGG Planilux® produced by the float process is<br>
coated on both sides by a magnetically enhanced cathode<br>
sputtering method (called the "magnetron sputtering"<br>
process) with the following stack of three layers:<br>
Glass / Si3N4 / SiO2 / TiO2<br>
2 0.2 nm 22 .1 nm 95.9 nm<br>
(The same stack is present on the opposite side.)<br>
The first layer has a refractive index of 2.04<br>
at 550 nm.<br>
For the second and third layers, these values<br>
are respectively 1.48 and 2.33 at 550 nm.<br>
A photocatalytic coating with a mesoporous<br>
structure is formed on the two sides of the material<br>
obtained.<br>
The liquid treatment composition is obtained by<br>
mixing in a first step 22.3 ml of tetraethoxysilane,<br>
22.1 ml of absolute ethanol, 9 ml of HC1 in<br>
demineralized water until the solution becomes clear<br>
(final pH 1.25), and then placing the flask in a water<br>
bath at 60°C for 1 h.<br>
In a second step, an organic structuring agent<br>
is added to the sol previously obtained, in the form of<br>
a solution of a polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene block<br>
copolymer sold by BASF under the registered trademark<br>
Pluronic PE6800 (molecular weight 8000), in proportions<br>
such that the PE6800/Si molar ratio is 0.01. This is<br>
obtained by mixing 3.78 g of PE6800, 50 ml of ethanol<br>
and 25 ml of the sol.<br>
Nanoparticles of TiO2 crystallized in the<br>
anatase form having a size of about 50 nm are added to<br>
the liquid composition thus obtained before deposition<br>
on the sample. The deposition is carried out on the two<br>
sides of the sample by cell coating.<br>
The samples then undergo heat treatment at 250°C<br>
for two hours to consolidate the mesoporous coating and<br>
to remove the solvent and the organic structuring<br>
agent.<br>
The pores of the coating thus formed have a<br>
size of 4-5 nm.<br>
SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy) analysis<br>
of the coating having a mesoporous structure confirms<br>
that the Ti/Si atomic ratio is exactly identical to<br>
that of the initial liquid composition. This Ti/Si<br>
ratio is selected at 1. The SIMS analysis also serves<br>
to check that the nanoparticles are distributed<br>
uniformly in the three dimensions of the coating.<br>
The thickness e4 of the photocatalytic coating<br>
in nm is measured from SIMS profiles and SEM (Scanning<br>
Electron Microscope) images and is 72 nm. In the<br>
present case, the multilayer stack inserted under this<br>
coating is optimized so that the light reflectance of<br>
the final material is only slightly affected by changes<br>
in the thickness of the photocatalytic coating. In the<br>
present case, the thickness of the photocatalytic<br>
coating may vary from 60 to 100 nm.<br>
The refractive index of this coating is<br>
measured by ellipsometry techniques well known to a<br>
person skilled in the art. It is 1.54 at 550 nm.<br>
The reflectance measurements are taken using a<br>
UV-visible spectrophotometer. The light reflectance<br>
values (RL) and colorimetric parameters (a*,b ) are<br>
calculated between 380 and 780 nm from an experimental<br>
reflection spectrum at almost normal incidence using as<br>
references the D65 illuminant as defined by standard<br>
ISO/CIE 10526 and the CIE 1931 observer as defined by<br>
standard ISO/CIE 10527.<br>
The photocatalytic activity is measured as<br>
follows:<br>
cutting of samples measuring 5x5 cm2,<br>
cleaning of the samples for 45 minutes under UV<br>
irradiation and oxygen blanket,<br>
measurement of the infrared spectrum by FTIR for<br>
wavenumbers of between 4000 and 400 cm"1, to<br>
prepare a reference spectrum,<br>
deposition of stearic acid: 60 microliters of a<br>
stearic acid solution dissolved in an amount of<br>
5 g/l in methanol are deposited by spin coating<br>
onto the sample,<br>
measurement of the infrared spectrum by FTIR,<br>
measurement of the area of the CH2-CH3 bond<br>
stretching bands between 3000 and 2700 cm-1,<br>
exposure to UVA-type radiation: the power received<br>
by the sample, respectively about 35 W/m2 and<br>
1.4 W/m2 to simulate outdoor and indoor exposure,<br>
is controlled by a photocell in the wavelength<br>
range 315-400 nm. The nature of the lamps is also<br>
different according to the lighting conditions:<br>
hot white fluorescent tubes reference Philips T12<br>
for indoor exposure, UV Philips Cleo Performance<br>
light bulbs for outdoor exposure,<br>
monitoring of the photodegradation of the stearic<br>
acid layer after successive exposure times of<br>
10 minutes by measuring the area of the CH2-CH3<br>
bond stretching bands between 3000 and 2700 cm"1,<br>
the photocatalytic activity under outdoor<br>
conditions kext is defined by the slope, expressed<br>
in cm-1.min-1, of the line representing the area of<br>
the CH2-CH3 bond stretching bands between 3000 and<br>
2700 cm-1 according to the UV exposure time, for a<br>
duration of between 0 and 30 minutes,<br>
the photocatalytic activity under indoor<br>
conditions klnt is defined as the weight percentage<br>
of stearic acid degraded (calculated from the<br>
infrared spectrum) after two hours of<br>
illumination.<br>
Under these conditions, the following<br>
measurements are obtained:<br>
Kext = 3.0 x 10-2 cm/min<br>
Kint = 20%.<br>
The light reflectance RL is 1%.<br>
The colorimetric parameters (a*,b*) are (0,0),<br>
attesting to a perfectly neutral color.<br>
The reflectance on a coated side is hence 12.5%<br>
of the reflectance on an uncoated side of the<br>
substrate.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
This example is described in application<br>
FR 2 814 094, in which it is Example 4.<br>
Only one side of the substrate is treated, the<br>
material thus comprising as follows:<br>
Glass / Si3N4 / SiO2 / Ti02<br>
25 nm 22 nm 104 nm<br>
The photocatalytic coating consists here of a<br>
layer of Ti02 obtained by cathode sputtering.<br>
The light reflectance is 15.8%, which means<br>
that the treated side has a light reflectance of about<br>
11.8%, or nearly three times the reflectance of an<br>
uncoated side of the substrate. Hence, this coating<br>
cannot be qualified as antireflection in the context of<br>
the present invention, even if it is thus qualified in<br>
the application where it is described.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A polycarbonate-based substrate is used here,<br>
intended for the production of ophthalmic lenses, of<br>
index 1.586 and coated with an abrasion-resistant<br>
coating obtained by hardening a solution composed of<br>
colloidal silica and a hydrolysate of an epoxidized<br>
alkoxysilane.<br>
This substrate is coated with a photocatalytic<br>
coating under conditions similar to those described in<br>
Example 1.<br>
The differences from the conditions in Example<br>
1 are as follows:<br>
the consolidation treatment and removal of the<br>
solvent and structuring agent cannot be carried<br>
out at high temperature because of the low thermal<br>
resistance of the subtrate. These treatments are<br>
therefore replaced by a consolidation heat<br>
treatment carried out at 60°C for three hours under<br>
UV irradiation. This final step serves to degrade<br>
the structuring agent thanks to the photocatalytic<br>
action of titanium dioxide,<br>
the Ti/Si ratio is 0.25.<br>
In this case, the abrasion-resistant coating<br>
also has the advantage of preventing any degradation of<br>
the polycarbonate substrate by photocatalysis.<br>
The index of the photocatalytic layer is 1.39<br>
at 550 nm, its thickness is about 100 nm.<br>
The light reflectance of a coated side is 1.05%<br>
or 22% of the reflectance of an uncoated side of the<br>
substrate. The colorimetric parameters (a*,b*) are<br>
(5.6;7.6) .<br>
The photocatalytic coating alone is hence<br>
capable in this case of conferring an antireflection<br>
function on the substrate, but weaker than obtainable<br>
with a more complex coating.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
This example resumes the same conditions as<br>
Example 3, with the only difference that the Ti/Si<br>
ratio is 2 .<br>
In this case the index of the photocatalytic<br>
coating is 1.61 at 550 nm, and the light reflectance of<br>
the material is 9.72%, higher than the reflectance of<br>
the uncoated substrate.<br>
The increase in the titanium content of the<br>
photocatalytic coating has in fact caused an increase<br>
in the refractive index, detrimental to the possibility<br>
of obtaining an antireflection function.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
This example resumes the conditions of Example<br>
4, but with the insertion of a stack of layers obtained<br>
by vacuum evaporation between the photocatalytic<br>
coating and the abrasion-resistant coating. This stack<br>
comprises a first layer based on zirconium and titanium<br>
dioxides, a second layer based on silica, a third layer<br>
based on titanium dioxide according to the following<br>
configuration:<br>
Polycarbonate / ZrTiOx / SiO2 / Ti02<br>
36 nm 15 nm 5 6nm<br>
The following are thus obtained:<br>
a light reflectance RL of 1.21%;<br>
colorimetric parameters (a*,b*) of (5.9;-5.8);<br>
the reflectance of a coated side hence<br>
represents 12.5% of the reflectance of an uncoated side<br>
of the substrate.<br>
This substrate is thus particularly suitable<br>
for being used for ophthalmic lenses. In fact it has<br>
the following added advantages:<br>
very high photocatalytic activity indoors and<br>
outdoors, for example, guaranteeing a rapid<br>
disappearance of fingerprints,<br>
low light reflectance and relatively neutral<br>
color.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
This example roughly repeats the operating<br>
conditions of Example 1.<br>
The differences are as follows:<br>
The Ti/Si ratio is 0.25. The refractive index<br>
of the photocatalytic coating is 1.39 at 550 nm, and<br>
its thickness is 97 nm. The latter quantity may<br>
however vary between 70 and 120 nm without<br>
substantially affecting the light reflectance,<br>
representing a range of variation whereof the extent is<br>
more than 50% with regard to the median value of this<br>
range.<br>
The thicknesses of the layers of the stack<br>
inserted between the substrate and the photocatalytic<br>
coating are:<br>
Glass / Si3N4 / SiO2 / Ti02<br>
18.2 nm 4 3.9 nm 113.4 nm<br>
The following are thus obtained:<br>
Rl = 1%<br>
(a*b*) = (0,0)<br>
kext =1.0 x 10-2 cm-1/min.<br>
The optical results are therefore similar to<br>
those obtained in Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
This example resumes the operating conditions<br>
of Example 1, with the exception of the following<br>
conditions :<br>
The substrate is made of extra-clear printed<br>
glass sold by Saint-Gobain Glass under the trademark<br>
SGG Albarino®. Only one side of the substrate is<br>
treated.<br>
The Ti/Si ratio is 2. The refractive index of<br>
the photocatalytic coating is then 1.61 at 550 nm, and<br>
its thickness is 83 nm. The latter quantity may<br>
however vary between 7 0 and 100 nm without<br>
substantially affecting the light reflectance,<br>
representing a range of variation whereof the extent is<br>
35% with regard to the median value of this range.<br>
The thicknesses of the layers of the stack<br>
inserted between the substrate and the photocatalytic<br>
coating are:<br>
Glass / Si3N4 / SiO2 / Ti02<br>
41.0 nm 14.2 nm 5 6.1 nm<br>
The following are thus obtained:<br>
RL = 4.5%<br>
(a*b*) = (l.l;-2.0)<br>
kext = 4.9 x 10-2 cm/min.<br>
The reflectance of the coated side is 0.6% or<br>
15% of the reflectance of an uncoated side of the<br>
substrate.<br>
The photocatalytic layer has a high Ti/Si<br>
ratio, and thus its activity is extremely intense.<br>
This glass is employed for making photovoltaic<br>
panels. The combination of the antireflection and<br>
self-cleaning functions thereby serves to obtain a high<br>
and durable energy efficiency over time.<br>
EXAMPLES 8 TO 10<br>
These various examples differ from Example 1 in<br>
the nature of the stack inserted between the substrate<br>
and the photocatalytic coating, and optionally in the<br>
Ti/Si ratio.<br>
This stack consists of the following layers:<br>
Glass / Si3N4 / SiO2 / Si3N4<br>
e1(nm) e2 (nm) e3(nm)<br>
The third layer here is silicon nitride instead<br>
of titanium dioxide. This change is intended to<br>
improve the resistance of the stack to thermomechanical<br>
stresses occurring during the toughening or bending<br>
steps.<br>
Table 1 lists the operating conditions and the<br>
results obtained for these three examples.<br>
The quantity ?e4 represents the range of values<br>
of e4 for which the reflectance remains substantially<br>
lower than that of the uncoated substrate. The extent<br>
of this range respectively represents 74%, 50% and 35%<br>
of the median value of the range.<br>
The reflectances of the coated sides are<br>
respectively 12.5%, 12.5% and 20% of the reflectance of<br>
an uncoated side. Moreover, the reflectance of a coated<br>
side remains lower than the reflectance of an uncoated<br>
side of the substrate over the entire 400-800 run range.<br>
These glasses are particularly suitable for the<br>
production of show windows or counters for shops. The<br>
curved windows thus formed have the advantage of<br>
highlighting the objects placed on sale thanks to the<br>
antireflection function, while having effective self-<br>
cleaning action indoors.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
The example given in Table 1 of the<br>
abovementioned patent application EP-A-1 2 91 331 was<br>
reproduced according to the technical teaching<br>
contained in said application. The underlying stack<br>
and the 107.76 nm thick titanium dioxide layer were<br>
deposited by the magnetron sputtering process.<br>
The activity kext measured under outdoor<br>
conditions is 0.3 x 10-2 cm_1/min, which is quite<br>
insufficient to ensure rapid degradation of organic<br>
dirt. Moreover, as shown in Figure 8 of the<br>
abovementioned application, a vary slight variation in<br>
thickness (in this case 7 nm) greatly modifies the<br>
value of the reflectance. Finally, the reflectance of<br>
the coated substrate is extremely dependent on the<br>
wavelength, the values obtained at 400 nm and 800 nm<br>
being extremely high.<br>

photocatalytic coating has an activity under indoor lighting conditions,<br>
expressed as a weight percentage of degraded stearic acid, that is greater<br>
than or equal to 30%.<br>
14. The substrate as claimed in one of the preceding claims, wherein the<br>
photocatalytic coating has a mesoporous structure comprising at least<br>
partially crystalline titanium dioxide.<br>
15. The substrate as claimed in claim 14, wherein with the exception of titanium<br>
dioxide, the mesoporous structure consists mainly of silica (SiO2).<br>
16. The substrate as claimed in either of claims 14 and 15, wherein at least<br>
partially crystalline titanium dioxide is incorporated in the mesoporous<br>
structure in the form of perfectly discernible particles.<br>
17. The substrate as claimed in either of claims 15 and 16, wherein the Ti/Si<br>
atomic ratio is between 0.6 and 1.2.<br>
18. The plastic substrate as claimed in claim 1, wherein a scratch-resistant or<br>
abrasion-resistant coating is inserted between the substrate and the<br>
photocatalytic coating.<br>
19. The plastic substrate as claimed in claim 2, wherein a scratch-resistant or<br>
abrasion-resistant coating is inserted between the substrate and the coating<br>
intended to reduce the light reflectance.<br>
20. A method for producing a substrate as claimed in one of claims 1 to 19,<br>
comprising the following steps:<br>
- formation of a "sol" comprising at least one precursor of the material<br>
constituting the mesoporous structure of the coating and at least one<br>
organic structuring agent diluted in a solvent,<br>
- sol "maturing" step,<br>
- addition of titanium dioxide nanoparticles or crystallites to the sol,<br>
- application of the sol to at least one surface of the substrate to be coated,<br>
- removal of the solvent,<br>
- removal of the organic structuring agent.<br>
21. The method as claimed in claim 20, wherein the substrate being made of<br>
plastic, the step of removal of the solvent and the organic structuring agent,<br>
is carried out at a temperature lower than or equal to 80°C under UV<br>
irradiation.<br>
22. Glazing wherein it comprises a substrate as claimed in claim 1.<br>
23. An ophthalmic lens wherein it comprises a substrate as claimed in either of<br>
claims 18 and 19.<br><br><br>
A transparent or semitransparent substrate having, on at least part of at least one<br>
of its sides, a photocatalytic coating based on titanium dioxide, characterized in<br>
that the coated side has a light reflectance lower than that of an uncoated side of<br>
the substrate and the coated side has a reflectance lower than or equal to 60% of<br>
that of an uncoated side of the substrate.<br></td>
