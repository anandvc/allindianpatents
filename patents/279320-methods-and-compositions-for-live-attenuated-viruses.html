Field<br>
Embodiments herein relate to compositions and methods for stabilizing live, attenuated viruses. Other embodiments relate to compositions and methods for redi cing degradation of live, attenuated viruses. Still other embodiments relate to uses of these compositions in kits for portable applications and methods.<br>
Background<br>
Vaccines to protect against viral infections have been effectively used to rec uce the incidence of human disease. One of the most successful technologies for viral vacc ines is to immunize animals or humans with a weakened or attenuated strain of the virus (a " ive, attenuated virus"). Due to limited replication after immunization, the attenuated sti ain does not cause disease. However, the limited viral replication is sufficient to express the full repertoire of viral antigens and generates potent and long-lasting immune response;. to the virus.   Thus, upon subsequent exposure to a pathogenic strain of the virus, the imn unized individual is protected from disease. These live, attenuated viral vaccines are amon \ the most successful vaccines used in public health.<br>
Ten of the sixteen viral vaccines approved for sale in the U.S. are live, attenuated viruses. Highly successful live viral vaccines include the yellow fever 17D virus, Sabin poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella and vaccinia viruses. Use of the vaccinia virus vaccine to control smallpox outbreaks led to the first and only eradication of a human disease. The Sabin poliovirus vaccine has helped prevent crippling dis
Recent technical advances, such as reassortment, reverse genetics and cold adaptation, have led to the licensure oflive, attenuated viruses for influenza and rolavirus. A<br>
number of live, viral vaccines developed with recombinant DNA technologies are ii human clinical testing, including vaccines for West Nile disease, dengue fever, malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. These recombinant viral vaccines rely on manipulation of well-characterized attenuated viral vaccines, such as adenovirus, vaccinia virus, yellow fever 17D or the dengue virus, DEN-2 PDK-53. The safe, attenuated viruses are genetically engineered to express protective antigens for other viral or bacterial pathogens. Several recombinant vira [ vaccines have been approved for animal use, including a canarypox/feline leukemia recombi nant virus, a canarypox/canine distemper recombinant virus, a canarypox/West Nile recombin; tnt virus and a yellow fever/West Nile recombinant virus. As a group, the live attenuated vi -us vaccines are amongst the most successful medical interventions in human history, second only to the advent of antibiotics and hold the promise to improve public health throaghout the world.<br>
In order for live, attenuated viral vaccines to be effective, they must be caps ble of replicating after immunization. Thus, any factors that inactivate the virus can cripp le the vaccine. For example, widespread distribution and use of the smallpox vaccine prior to World War II was limited because the virus was inactivated after only a few days a: ambient temperatures. In the 1920s, French scientists demonstration that freeze-dried vacci le provided long term stability and techniques for large-scale manufacture of freeze-d -ied vaccine were developed in the 1940s (see for example Collier 1955). In addition to freeze-drying, various additives have been identified that can help stabilize the viruses in live, attenuated viral vaccines (See for example Burke, Hsu et al 1999). These stabilizers typically include one or more of the following components: divalent cations, buffered salt solutions, chelators, urea, sugars (e.g. sucrose, lactose, trehalose), polyols (e.g., glycerol, mannitol, sorbitol, polyethylene glycol), amino acids, protein hydrolystates (e.g. casein hydrclysate, lactalbumin hydrolysate, peptone), proteins (e.g. gelatin, human serum albumin) or polymers (e.g. dextran).<br>
However, even with these stabilizing agents, many of the commonly used viccines still require refrigeration for stabilization. Other commonly used vaccines are sensitive to temperature extremes; either excessive heat or accidental freezing can inactivate thu vaccine. Maintaining this "cold chain" throughout distribution is particularly difficult in the developing world. Thus, there remains a need for improving the stability of both existing and newly developed live, attenuated viral vaccines.<br>
Fl aviviruses are amongst the most labile viruses. They are enveloped virusod vector and their vertebrate host species (often birds or mammals). Expanding urbanizatioi i, worldwide travel and environmental changes (such as deforestation or rain patterns i have lead to the emergence of several flavhiruses as threats to human public health. Sue h viruses include, but are not limited to, yellow fever virus, the dengue viruses, West Nile viius, Japanese encephalitis virus, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses.<br>
Through intensive mosquito control and vaccination efforts, yellow fever w is eliminated from much of North, Central and South America, the Caribbean and Euiope. However, in the last 20 years, the number of countries reporting cases has increases. Yellow fever virus is now endemic in major portions of Africa and South America and some Caribbean islands. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 200,000 cases of yellow fever occur annually leading to 30,000 deaths. Since World War II, dengue flaviviruses have spread to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world an d now threaten over 3.5 billion people, about half of the world's population.   The WHO e jtimates that 50-100 million cases of dengue fever occur annually. 500,000 of these are the nore sever, life-threatening form of the disease, termed dengue hemorrhagic fever, that leads to more than 25,000 deaths per year. A particularly virulent form of West Nile virus \ /as introduced into the Western hemisphere, presumably by travel, in New York in 199 9. The mosquito-transmitted virus infected birds as the primary host, but also caused disea &gt;e and mortality in humans and horses.   West Nile virus spread throughout the United Sta :es and i nto Canada and Mexico. Since its introduction, West Nile virus has caused over 2i ),000 reported cases of West Nile disease leading to 950 deaths in the United States.   Jap anese encephalitis virus causes 30,000 to 50,000 cases of neurological disease annually, primarily in eastern and southern Asia. 25-30% of the reported cases are fatal. The tick-borne encephalitis viruses are endemic to parts of Europe and Asia and continue to cause episodic outbreaks affecting thousands of individuals. Related viruses with more limited geographical spread include Kunjin virus (a close relative of West Nile) and Murray Valley enceihalitis<br>
virus in Australia and New Guinea, St. Louis encephalitis virus in North and South America, the Usutu, Koutango, and Yaonde viruses in Africa, and Cacipacore virus in South American.<br>
Live, attenuated viral vaccines have been developed that are safe and protect against flavivirus diseases, such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis. The livs, attenuated viral vaccine, 17D, has been widely used to prevent yellow fever. The c arrent flavivirus vaccines are lyophilized in the presence of stabilizers. Nonetheless, the vaccines require storage and shipment at 2 — 8° C, a requirement that is difficult to achieve it. the developing world and more remote regions of developed nations. Furthermore, upon reconstitution, the vaccines rapidly lose potency even when stored at 2 - 8° C.<br>
The measles vaccine is another example of a labile attenuated virus i hat is used worldwide to prevent disease. Measles virus is an enveloped, non-segmented negative strand RNA virus of the Paramyxovirus family. Measles is a highly contagious, seasonal disease that can affect virtually every child before puberty in the absence of vaccins.tion. In developing countries, mortality rates in measles-infected children can by as high as 2 to 15%. Indeed, despite efforts to institute worldwide immunization, measles still causes greater than 7,000 deaths in children per year. The measles vaccine is a live, attenuated virus that is manufactured in primary chicken fibroblast cells.   The vaccine is stabilized with ge latin and sorbitol and is then lyophilized. The stabilized, lyophilized vaccine has a shelf life :&gt;f 2 years or more if stored at 2 to 8° C. However, the lyophilized vaccine still requires a cold chain that is difficult to maintain in the developing world. Furthermore, upon reconstitutian, the vaccine loses 50% of its potency within 1 hour at room temperature (20 to 25° C).<br>
Thus, a need exists in the art for improved vaccine formulations. SUMMARY<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS<br>
In the following sections, various exemplary compositions and methods are described in order to detail various embodiments. It will be obvious to one skilled n the art that practicing the various embodiments does not require the employment of all or even some of the specific details outlined herein, but rather that concentrations, times and other specific details may be modified through routine experimentation. In some cases, well kncvTi methods or components have not been included in the description.<br>
Stability of flavivirus vaccines has been assessed for both the existir g yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis live, attenuated viruses. When tested in 1987, only five of the twelve yellow fever vaccines manufactured at that time met minimal standards of stability. Subsequently, addition of a mixture of sugars, amino acids and divalent c itions was demonstrated to stabilize the lyophilized vaccine, so that the vaccine lost less than '. log of potency after incubation at 37° C for 14 days. Stabilizing lyophilized formulations lor the yellow fever vaccine have been described (see for example U. S. Pat. No 4,500,512). U.S. Patent No. 4,500,512, describes a combination of lactose, sorbitol, the divalent cations, calcium and magnesium, and at least one amino acid. While this formulation may help to<br>
stabilize the lyophilized vaccine, it fails to provide stability to the vaccine in aqueous form. Another study examined the ability of several different formulations including the compositions described above and the effect of sucrose, trehalose and lactalbumin jn the stability of the lyophilized yellow fever vaccine. Formulations consisting of 10 % sucrose alone, 2% sorbitol with 4% inositol, or 10% sucrose with 5% lactalbumin, 0.1 g/1 CaC12 and 0.076 g/1 MgS04 were found to provide the best stability (see for example Adebay o, Sim-Brandenburg et al. 1998). However, in all cases after resuspension, yellow fever -vaccine is still very unstable and must be discarded after only about one hour (see for exampl; Monath 1996; Adebayo, Sim-Brandenburg et al. 1998). This leads to vaccine wastage and the potential to cause administration of ineffective vaccine under field conditions, if an unstable vaccine is used.<br>
Another live, attenuated flavirus vaccine for protection against Japa lese encephalitis has been licensed and is in widespread use in China (see for example Halstead and Tsai 2004). The Japanese encephalitis vaccine strain, SA 14-14-2, is grown or primary hamster kidney cells and the cell supernatant is harvested and coarsely filtered. Or e previous composition included 1% gelatin and 5% sorbitol added as stabilizers. Using these stabilizers, the vaccine is lyophilized and then is stable at 2 to 8° C for at least 1.5 years, but for only 4 months at room temperature and 10 days at 37° C. As with the yellow ft ver vaccine, the reconstituted vaccine is very labile and is stable for only 2 hours at rocm temperature (see for example Wanf, Yang et al 1990). In certain embodiments heroin, live, attenuated flavirus virus compositions for stabilizing or reducing the degradation o 'Japanese encephalitis are contemplated.<br>
No formulation for a live, attenuated flavivirus vaccine has been ide atified that provides long term stability of lyophilized formulations at temperatures greater tha:i 2 - 8° C. In addition, no formulation has been described that prevents loss of titer, stabilizes or reduces degradation of aqueous vaccines for greater than a few hours.<br>
Formulations for other live, attenuated viruses have also been described (see for example Burke, Hsu et al. 1999).  One common stabilizer, referred to as SPGA is a mixture of 2 to 10% sucrose, phosphate, potassium glutamate and 0.5 to 2% serum albumin (see for example Bovarnick, Miller et al. 1950). Various modifications of this basi; formulation have been identified with different cations, with substitutions of starch hydrolysate or dextran for sucrose, and with substitutions of casein hydrolysate or poly-vinyl<br>
pyrrolidone for serum albumin. Other formulations use hydrolyzed gelatin instead of serum albumin as a protein source (Burke, Hsu et al 1999).

Those skilled in the art will recognize that compositions or formulas herein relate to viruses that are attenuated by any means, including but not limited to, cell :ulture passage, reassortment, incorporation of mutations in infectious clones, reverse genetics, other recombinant DNA or RNA manipulation. In addition, those skilled in the art will r jcognize that other embodiments relate to viruses that are engineered to express any other proteins or RNA including, but not limited to, recombinant flaviviruses, recombinant adenovirises, recombinant poxviruses, recombinant retroviruses, recombinant adeno-associated viruses and recombinant herpes viruses. Such vinises may be used as vaccines for infectious diseases, vaccines to treat oncological conditions, or viruses to introduce express proteins or RNA (e.g., gene therapy, antisense therapy, ribozyme therapy or small inhibitory RNA therapy) to treat disorders.<br>
In some embodiments, compositions herein can contain one or more viruses with membrane envelopes (e.g., enveloped viruses) of the Togavirus, Flavivirus, Coronavirus, Rhabdovirus, Filovirus, Paramyxovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, Arenavirus, Retrovirus, Hepadnavirus., Herpesvirus or Poxvirus families. In certain embodiments compositions contain one or more enveloped RNA viruses of the Togavirus, Flavivirus, Coronavirus, Rhabdovirus, Filovirus, Paramyxovirus, Orthomyxovirus, Bunyavirus, Arenavirus, or Retrovirus families.

In certain embodiments, compositions can cor tain one or more live, attenuated Flaviviruses (e.g., dengue virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, or Japanese encephalitis virus).<br>
Some embodiments herein relate to compositions for live, attenuated viruses in aqueous or lyophilized form. Those skilled in the art will recognize that formula tions that improve thermal viral stability and prevent freeze-thaw inactivation will improve products that are liquid, powdered, freeze-driecl or lyophilized and prepared by methods known in the art. After reconstitution, such stabilized vaccines can be administered by a variety routes, including, but not limited to intradermal administration, subcutaneous administration, intramuscular administration, intranasal administration, pulmonary administration i &gt;r oral administration. A variety of devices are known in the art for delivery of the vaccin 5 including, but not limited to, syringe and needle injection, bifurcated needle admin stration, administration by intradermal patches or pumps, needle-free jet delivery, intradermal particle delivery, or aerosol powder delivery.<br>
Embodiments can include compositions consisting of one or more li ye attenuated viruses (as described above) and a mixture of one or more high molecular weight surfactants and one or more proteins in a physiological acceptable buffer. In certai: 1 embodiments, compositions include, but are not limited to one or more live attenuated viruses, one or more high molecular weight surfactants, one or more proteins, and one or more carbohydrates, in a physiological acceptable buffer.<br>
In other embodiments, compositions can contain one or more high n tolecular weight surfactants that increase the thermal stability of live, attenuated viruses. Surfactants have been incorporated into vaccine formulations to prevent material loss to surfaces such as glass vials (see for example Burke, Hsu et al. 1999). However, certain embodiment herein include high molecular weight surfactants with some unusual biochemical properties of utility for compositions and methods disclosed herein. The EO-PO block copolymers can include blocks of polyethylene oxide (-CH2CH2O- designated EO) and polypropylene oxide (-CH2CHCH3O- designated PO). The PO block can be flanked by two EO blocks ii a EOx-POy-EOx arrangement. Since the PO component is hydrophilic and the EO component is hydrophobic, overall hydrophilicity, molecular weight and the surfactant properties can be adjusted by varying x and y in the EOx-POy-EOx block structure. In aqueous solutions, the EO-PO block copolymers will self-assemble into micelles with a PO core and a cor ana of hydrophilic EO groups. EO-PO block copolymer formulations have been investigated as potential drug delivery agents for a variety of hydrophobic drugs and for protein, USA or inactivated vaccines (e.g. Todd, Lee el: al. 1998; Kabanov, Lemieux et al. 2002). A: high<br>
concentrations (for example: &gt; than 10%) certain of the higher molecular weight EO-PO block copolymers will undergo reverse gelation, forming a gel as the temperature increases. Gel formation at body temperatures permits use of the EO-PO block copolymer gels to act as a depot in drug and vaccine delivery applications (see for example Coeshott, Smith son et al. 2004). In addition, due to their surfactant properties, these polymers have been used in adjuvant formulations, and as an emulsifier in topically applied creams and gels. The EO-PO block copolymers have also been shown to accelerate wound and burn healing and to seal cell membranes after radiation or electroporation-mediated damage.<br>
In other embodiments, vaccine compositions can include one or moi e surfactants with molecular weight of 1500 or greater. In a certain embodiment, the surfactant is a non-ionic, hydrophilic, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer (cr EO-PO block copolymer). While EO-PO block copolymers have been used as adjuvants and delivery vehicles for inactivated vaccines, protein vaccines or DNA vaccines, their use to prevent inactivation of a live virus is not anticipated in the art. In a particular embodiment, a formulation can contain one or more EO-PO polymers with a molecular weight of. ,000 or greater. In further embodiments, compositions can include in part an EO-PO block copolymer Pluronic F127 or Pluronic P123. Those skilled in the art will recognize that modifications of the surfactants can be chemically made. It is contemplated herein any essentially equivalent surfactant polymers are considered.<br>
Embodiments herein cam include compositions of one or more live, attenuated viruses, one or more surfactants and one or more proteins. In certain embodiments, a protein can be an albumin. Serum albumin is one of the most common proteins in vertebra :e blood and has multiple functions. The protein is 585 amino acids with a molecular weight of 66500.  Human serum albumin is not glycosylated and has a single free thiol group implicated in some of its myriad binding activities. Serum albumin is predominant: y a-helix with three structural domains, each subdivided into two subdomains. Albumin is known to specifically bind a variety of molecules, including drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, halothane, propofol and warfarin as well as fatty acids, amino acids, steroids, glutathione, metals, bilirubin, lysolecithin, hematin, and prostaglandins. The different structural domains are implicated in drug binding; most small molecule drugs and hormones bind to or e of two primary sites located in subdomains IIA and IIIA. Due to its lack of immunogenici .y, albumin is commonly used as a carrier protein in biological products. Since the prctein dose<br>
contained in a live, attenuated viral vaccine can be fractions of a microgram (deriv
In certain embodiments, serum albumin may be from a human or otl ter mammalian source. For vaccines intended for human use, particular embodiments ran include human albumin or other human products as needed in order to reduce or eliminate adverse immune responses. Those skilled in the art will recognize that albumins sp ecific for each species may be used in animal vaccines (e.g. canine albumin for canine produ ;ts, bovine albumin for bovine products). In further embodiments, the protein is a recombinan t human albumin. Standard methods exist for expressing recombinant human albumin or pcrtions thereof in a variety of expression systems including bacteria, yeast, algae, plant, rm mmalian cell or transgenic animal systems. In addition, serum albumin or portions thereof an be produced in cell-free systems or chemically synthesized. Recombinant human albt min produced in these or in any similar system is incorporated herein. Those skilled in the art will recognize that other proteins can substitute for albumin. For example, albumin is a member of a multi-gene family. Due to their structural and sequence similarities, other mer ibers of the family (e.g. a-fetoprotein, vitamin D binding protein, or afamin) may substitute for albumin in compositions and methods contemplated herein. Those skilled in the ar t will also recognize that modifications can be made to albumin by any means known in the a: t, for example, by recombinant DNA technology, by post-translational modification, by ] iroteolytic cleavage and/or by chemical means. Those substitutions and alterations to albumir that provide essentially equivalent stabilizing function to serum albumin without substil utions and alterations are contemplated herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, compositions having a high molecular weig ht surfactant, a protein and a carbohydrate in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer are described. In some embodiments, the carbohydrate is a sugar or a polyol. Sugars c an include, but are not limited to, monosaccharides, (e.g. glucose, galactose, ribose, muinose,<br>
rhamno.se, talose, xylose or allose arabinose), disaccharides (e.g. trehalose, sucrose, maltose, isomaltose, cellibiose, gentiobiose, laminaribose, xylobiose, mannobiose, lactose, cr fructose.), trisaccharides (e.g. acarbose, raffinose, melizitose, panose, or cellotriose) or sugar polymers (e.g. dextran, xanthan, pullulan, cyclodextrins, amylose, amylopectin, starch, celloologosaccharides, cellulose, maltooligosaccharides, glycogen, chitosan, or chi :in). Polyols can include, but are not limited to, mannitol, sorbitol, arabitol, erythritol, rx altitol, xylitol, glycitol, glycol, polyglycitol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ar d glycerol.<br>
In a particular embodiment, formulations can contain a combination of one or more EO-PO block copolymers, one or more proteins, and trehalose in a pharmaco ogically acceptable buffer. In certain embodiments, trehalose can be present at concentratic ns ranging from 5 to 50% (w/v). Trehalose has been used to enhance the stability of protein formulations. It is widely known in the art as a cryopreservative and is used in nari ire to protect organisms from stress. Anhydrobiotic organisms that can tolerate low wate r conditions contain large amounts of trehalose. Trehalose has been shown to prevent both membrane fusion events and phase transitions that can cause membrane destabiliza tion during drying. Structural analysis suggests that trehalose fits well between the poh r head groups in lipid bylayers. Trehalose also prevents denaturation of labile proteins duing drying. It is thought that trehalose stabilizes proteins by hydrogen bonding with pc lar protein residues.   Trehalose is a disaccharide consisting of two glucose molecules in a 1:1 linkage. Due to the 1:1 linkage, trehalose has little or no educing power and is thus essentially non-rcactivc with amino acids and proteins. This lack of reducing activity may improve the stabilizing affect of trehalose on proteins. In certain embodiments, trehalose provides stability to live, attenuated viruses. This activity of trehalose may be due to its ability to stabilize both the membranes and coat proteins of the viruses.<br>
In further embodiments, compositions can include one or more ECK 'O block copolymers, one or more proteins and one or more carbohydrates, where one of the carbohydrates is chitosan, in a physiological acceptable buffer to provide improved stability to live, attenuated viruses. In certain embodiments, compositions can include chitosan at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 2% (e.g at a pH of about 6.8). Chitosan is a cationic polysaccharide derived by deacetylation of chitin, the structural polymer of crustacean exoskeletons. It is a polymer of N-acetyl-glucosamine and glucosamine; the content of the<br>
two carbohydrates depends on the extent of deacetylation. Chitosan's positive charge allows it to bind to negatively charged surfaces and molecules. Thus, it binds musosal surfaces and is thought to promote mucosal absorption. Chitosan also can bind and form nanoparticles with DNA, RNA and other oligonucleotides and has been used in non-viral gene delivery. Certain embodiments herein demonstrate that chitosan increases live, attenuated vi ais stability.<br>
In certain embodiments, compositions can be described that typicall y include a physiologically acceptable buffer. Those skilled in the art recognize that a variety i )f physiologically acceptable buffers exist, including, but not limited to buffers containing phosphate, TRIS, MOPS, HEPES, bicarbonate, other buffers known in the art ad combinations of buffers. In addition, those skilled in the art recognize that adjusting salt concentrations to near physiological levels (e.g., saline or 0.15 M total salt) may be optimal for parenteral administration of compositions to prevent cellular damage and/or pai n at the site of injection. Those skilled in the art also will recognize that as carbohydrate concentrations increase, salt concentrations can be decreased to maintain equivalen t osmolarity to the formulation. In certain embodiments, a buffering media with pH greater than 6.8 is contemplated; some live, attenuated viruses (e.g. flaviviruses) are unstable at low pH.  In another embodiment, physiologically acceptable buffer can be phosphate-bi iffered saline (PBS).<br>
Some live, attenuated "viral vaccine compositions herein concern cor ipositions that increase stability and/or reduce deterioration of live, attenuated virus in addition to having reduced immunogenicity or are non-immunogenic.

In certain more particular embodiments, in order to reduce immune reac:ion to a vaccine, the serum albumin can be derived from a vertebrate species or in other embodiments, from the same source as the subject (e.g. human). In other embodirr ents, the carbohydrate agent is trehalose.   In certain embodiments, at least one surfactant agent is the EO-PO block copolymer Pluonic F127. In some live, attenuated viral vaccine com] tositions at least one carbohydrate agent is trehalose. In certain live, attenuated viral vaccine compositions include, the EO-PO block copolymer Pluronic F127 where the conce ltration is from 0.1 to 4% (w/v); and/or serum albumin concentration from 0.001 to 3% (w/v) and/or the trehalose concentration can be from 5 to 50% (w/v).<br>

Base stability of DEN-2 PDK 53 flavivirus in liquid phase<br>
In one illustrative method, the thermal stability for flaviviruses in lie uid phase was investigated. In accordance with this method, the base stability of the DEN-2 IDK 53 parental vaccine vector, stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), at different temperatures was determined (Table 1). In one example, lxlO4 pfu of DEN-2 PDK 53 virus in a total volume of 0.5ml PBS was incubated, in 2ml screw capped vials at either 4° C, room temperature (~ 21° C) or 37° C. After 24 hours of incubation viral titer and activity was determined by a Neutral Red agarose overlay plaque titration assay in Vero cells. A s illustrated in Table 1, incubation of DEN-2 PDK 53 in PBS at 4° C results in an awrage fourfold decrease in viral titer and complete loss in viral activity when incubated at 37° C for the same period. These results demonstrate the relatively poor stability of the DEN-2 PDK 53 flavivirus in the absence of stabilizing excipients.<br>

Stabiliz ng Effects of Compositions<br>
In certain exemplary compositions, pharmaceutically acceptable exc ipients contemplated herein that aid in thermal stability of live viral vaccines are known in the art. In one exemplary method, PBS was used as a base composition to assess the stabilizing effects of different excipients. In these examples, a stock solution of each excipient was mide in PBS and the pH adjusted to approximately 7.1 with NaOH, except for chitosan whore the pH of the stock solution was adjusted to approximately 6.8. Excipients were diluted in PBS to the final concentrations indicated (w/v) (Table 2). In accordance with this method, lxl d4 pfu of DEN-2 PDK 53 virus, in serum-free medium, was added to 0.5ml of each composiiion and stored a: 37° C for 24 hours. Following incubation, viral activity and titer was deteimined by plaque titration in Vero cells, as described above. As illustrated in Table 2, the stabilizing effects of compositions including a single excipient, at various concentrations comparable to previous experimental examples, was minimal. However, some excipients for example, trehalose and recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA), were more effective thai others at stabilizing DEN-2 PDK 53 virus at 37° C. Results of the study represented in Table 2 also revealec. that increased stabilizing effects of several excipients, including rHSA and trehalose, can be obtained within certain ranges of concentrations of these excipien :s. In this particular example, trehalose was more effective at concentrations above 15% (w/v) and F127 at concentrations between 0.5 and 3%.<br>

Stabilizing effects of compositions including specific combinations of excipients<br>
In the following illustrative procedure, compositions including mult, pie excipients in differing combinations and concentrations were tested for stabilizing 
a pluronic co-polymer non-ionic surfactant and a protein were optimal at improving DEN-2 PDK 53 stability at 37° C. Formulations including trehalose, F127 and rHSA had tie greatest stabilizing effects. Unexpectedly, the combined stabilizing effect of these three excipients was much greater than the sum of that observed with each individual component suggesting synergism between the components. Improved thermal stability of the DEN-2 PDK 53 flavi vims was obtained through the synergistic activities of the combination of trehalose, F127 and rHSA could not have been anticipated based on prior art examples. Figs '. and 2 also illustrate that the stabilizing effect of the trehalose/F127/rHSA mixture was fuither enhanced by the addition of 0.05% chitosan. Fig. 2 shows that the rate of viral inacivation when stored over a 48 hour period at 37° C is significantly reduced by composition! containing trehalose, F127 and rHSA. Examples in the art suggest that the stability of flaviviruses can be enhanced by formulations containing Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ divalent cations. However, as represented in Figs. 1 and 2, the addition of Ca 2+ (0.0009M) and Mg '+ (0.0005M) to a formulation confers no additional stabilizing benefits. The results fiom Fig. 2 suggest that addition of divalent cations may have a negative impact to long term li :mid phase viral stability in the context of particular embodiments.<br>
In one exemplary method, a composition including trehalose, F127 rnd rHSA was assessed for its stabilizing properties with multiple flaviviruses. The stability o f chimeric DEN-2 flaviviruses expressing the membrane and envelope proteins from either W;st Nile (DEN-2/WN), Dengue 1 (DEN-2/D1), Dengue 3 (DEN-2/D3, or Dengue 4 (DEN-2 /D4) viruses was determined as described for Example 1. Illustrative results in Table 3 rsveal greatly improved liquid phase stability of all the chimeric flaviviruses when stored n a composition including trehalose, F127 and rHSA. The different chimeras express d fferent envelope and membrane proteins from five serologically distinct flaviviruses. In ac dition, West Nile virus and the dengue viruses are significantly divergent. This result suggests that compositions herein may be useful for liquid phase stabilization of diverse member j of the family of Flaviviradae as well as other virus families. The ability to stabilize flaviviruses at room temperature (~21° C) and at 4° C was examined by representative procedures as outlined for Example 1. The exemplary results, illustrated in Table 4, reveal that a composition including trehalose, F127 and rHSA effectively preserves viral activity for 7 days at 21 ° C and for 48 days at 4° C.<br>

Use of alternate components<br>
Another exemplary method was used to compare the stabilizing effe cts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and, gelatin, to that of rHSA and of different pluroni
F127. Thus, while proteins other than rHSA may be used in combination with treru lose and Fl 27 to aid in stabilization of flaviviral vaccines, the use of a serum albumin or closely related proteins is more suitable in accordance with this exemplary method. In addition, Fig. 3 illustrates that, as isolated excipients, the polymer Pluronic PI23 is comparable to Pluronic Fl27 in its ability to stabilitze the DEN-2 PDK-53 virus. However, in this exemph ry method. PI23 does not appear to be an effective subsititute for F127 in compositions also containing trehalose and serum albumin. As exemplified in Fig. 4, compositions containing trehalose, rHSA and other commonly used pharmaceutical surfactants such as Poly sorbate 20 (Tween 20), instead of a pluronic co-polymer, are not effective in stabilizing DEN-2 PDK 53 relative to formulations containing a pluronic co-polymer. These exemplary methc ds suggest better stabilizing efficiencies of formulations containing distinct high molecular we ight pluronic: co-polymer surfactants.<br>
Exemplary data is further illustrated in Fig 4. Fig. 4. represents stability of the DEN-2 PDK 53 virus in compositions containing different surfactants. DEN-2 PD C 53 was stored at 37° C for 23 hours in each formulation. Surfactants evaluated in this example include n-octyl-p-D-glucopyranoside (P -OG), Polysorbate 20 (P 20), Polysorbate i 10 (P 80 ) and F127 (F). Other formulation components include trehalose (T) and rHSA (A). Values are expressed as a percentage of the viral titer remaining after incubation relative to the input titer.<br>

No. 4,500,512), includes 4% lactose, 2 % sorbitol, 0. g/L CaCl2, 0.076 MgS04 and amino acids on the order of 0.0005M to 0.05M in PBS. Another composition reported by Adebayo et al (1998) consists of 10% sucrose, 5% lactalbumin, 0. lg/L CaCb, and 0.076 g/L MgSO
Adebayo, et al.  lxlO4 pfu of DEN-2 PDK 53 vaccine virus were incubated at 37° C in 0.5ml of each composition for 23 hours, after which viral activity and titer was assayed as described in Example 1. As exemplified in Fig. 5, some embodiments, for example formulation Fl, represents a significant improvement over those previously described compositions. In the example shown, virtually no viral activity was recovered after storage in the formu ations known in the art (formulations F3 and F4), whereas upwards of 50% of the initial viral titer was recovered after storage in a composition disclosed herein. These results reveal that previous formulations are ineffective at promoting live viral vaccine stability durin % liquid phase storage.<br>
Examplle 6<br>
Preservation of viral activity after multiple freeze-thaws<br>
In one exemplary method, the ability of select compositions to preserve viral activity after freeze-thaw cycles was demonstrated. lxlO4 pfu of DEN-2 PDK 53 vuccine virus was suspended in 0.5 ml of each composition in screw cap vials. For the first freeze-thaw cycle vials were frozen at -80° C for 24 hours and thawed rapidly at 37° C. This was immediately followed by a second freeze-thaw cycle where the vials were frozen al -80° C for 1 hour and thawed rapidly at 37° C. Viral titer and activity was then assessed by a plaque titration assay as described in Example 1. As illustrated in Fig. 6, particular compof itions that include trehalose, F127 and rHSA effectively preserved full viral activity through two freeze-thaw cycles. Additionally, compositions including these three excipients were more effective than those containing just a single excipient. The results of this particular illustrative experiment suggest the compositions and methods disclosed herein are an effective cryoprotectant for flaviviral vaccines and may facilitate viral preservation during fr;eze-drying, spray-drying, or other dehydration techniques.<br>
Example 7<br>
Stabilization of other live, attenuated viruses.<br>
Examples illustrated previously reveal effective liquid phase stabiliz ition of several live, attenuated flaviviruses in compositions including trehalose, F127 and iHSA. It is anticipated that embodiments disclosed herein may also be effective at stabilizing o ther live, attenuated viruses. For example, a formulation including trehalose, F127 and rHSA may be<br>
used to stabilize live attenuated measles virus, an attenuated sindbis virus, an attenuated influenza virus, a recombinant, attenuated adenovirus or a recombinant, attenuated vaccinia virus. In one exemplary method, these non-flaviviral viruses can be suspended and maintained in liquid phase, in a composition including trehalose, F127, and rHSA directly after hai-vesting from cell culture. In another illustrative method, non-flaviviral vin ses can be suspended in a composition prior to, or subsequent to, freeze or spray-drying. Statistically improved viral stability may demonstrate that the formulation of this embodiment is applicable to other attenuated viral vaccines outside of the Flavivirus family. Those skilled in the art recognize that application may then be extended to other live, attenuated vir ises.<br>
Example 8<br>
Safety and in vivo immunogenicity.<br>
Molecular interactions between excipients and molecular or cellular components may serve, not only to enhance stability of viral vaccines, but also to ciuse increased cell or tissue damage in vivo. Formulations may decrease the immunogenicity of these viral vaccines in live animals. In this example, it is demonstrated that exemp ary compositions are safe after subcutaneous injection and are essentially immunologically inert. Four different exemplary compositions were selected for testing in mice as follow:.<br>
Formulation 1:	15% Trehalose, 2% F-127, 1 % rHSA<br>
Formulation 2:	15% Trehalose, 2% F-127, 1% rHSA, ImM CaCl2/ 0.5mM MgS04<br>
Formulation 3:	15% Trehalose, 2% F-127, 1% rHSA, 0.5% chitosan<br>
Formulation 4:	22.5% Trehalose, 3% F-127, 1.5% rHSA<br>
Formulation 5:	PBS<br>
In certain methods described herein, groups of 8 or 9 NIH Swiss mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection with 1x10s pfu of a formulated DEN-2 PDK- 53/WN recombinant flavivirus vaccine at day 0 (d0), were boosted with the same formulate d vaccine at d29 and were then challenged with 103 pfu on a pathogenic West Nile strain (N"V 99) on d45.  Control mice (four groups of 8) received formulations 1—4 alone with no vir is.   No adverse events after administration in any of the immunized mice were observed. Thus, in this example, no apparent adverse events are caused by the exemplary formulations with or without vaccine virus. Sera were collected prior to immunization at dO, prior to boost at d28, prior to challenge at d44 and post-challenge at d75. West Nile neutralizing antibod y titers in<br>
the sera were determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The results of the study are represented in Table 5.<br>
Table 5: Neutralizing antibody and protection induced by formulated DEN2/\^N<br>
vaccines       	<br>
1 GMT = geometric mean titer; titers of 10.<br>
A majority of the animals receiving the DEN-2/WN vaccine sero-co nverted<br>
after the first dose regardless of whether no formulation (Formulation 5) or one of the<br>
exemplary formulations (Formulations 1 - 4) was used. In addition, all of the vacc nated<br>
animals sero-converted after the booster administration. Geometric mean PRNT titers<br>
(GMT) demonstrate few differences between the vaccine groups. Titers were low * iter the<br>
primary immunization, increased 3-10 fold after the boost and then showed a drariatic<br>
anamnestic response upon challenge. 100% of all the vaccinated animals survived challenge,<br>
again independent of vaccine formulation. Only 22% of the control animals survived; those<br>
that did survive showed evidence of potent neutralizing antibody responses after challenge.<br>
One advantage is that this example demonstrates that the exemplary formulations d 3 not<br>
reduce the ability of an exemplary recombinant DEN-2/WN vaccine to prevent Wert Nile<br>
disease in a mice.<br>
Example 9<br>
In another example, liquid compositions were used containing trehalose, rHSA and F127 to stabilize a West Nile chemeric flavivirus stored for various periods at e ither 25°C or 4°C. IxlO4 pfu of chimeric DEN-2/WN vaccine virus were incubated at each ten perature and viral activity was assessed at one or two week intervals as described in Exampl; 1. As illustrated in Figs.7 and 8, formulations containing trehalose, rHSA and F127 signiiicantly improved the thermal stability of the DEN-2/WN vaccine virus during storage at 2*°C and<br>
4°C, respectively. At 25°C loss of viral activity was less than one log over 7 days.   \t 4°C viral inactivation was negligible for periods up to 12 weeks when stored in exempl try formulations including trehalose, F127 and rHSA. Example 10<br>
In another exemplary method, stabilizing effects of compositions were demonstrated including trehalose, rHSA and a pluronic co-polymer with dehydrated DEN-2 PDK 53 vaccines, lxl 04 pfu of DEN-2 PDK 53 vaccine virus formulated in accordance with procedures disclosed herein. Formulated vaccines were placed in serum vials and s lbjected to conventional lyophilzation procedures. Dried vaccines were stoppered under vacuum, stored at either 37°C or 4°C for 14 days followed by reconstitution of the vaccine to its original liquid volume by addition of sterile water. Viral activity of the reconstituted vaccina was assessed as outlined earlier. At 37°C, in the presence of compositions containing trehalose, rHSA and a pluronic co-polymer formulated in phosphate buffered saline, an average viral titer loss of 1 log was observed (Fig. 9). No loss in viral activity was observed for formulated dehydrated DEN-2 PDK 53 viral vaccines stored at 4°C for 14 days. These results demonstrate effective preservation of a dehydrated viral vaccine utilizing compositions disclosed herein.<br>
Fig. 9. represents stability of lyophilized DEN-2 PDK 53 at differen; temperatures. Log titer loss of formulated lyophilized DEN-2 PDK 53 vaccine virus following incubation at 37°C or 4°C for 2 weeks as indicated. Formulations Fl (15% trehalose, 2% F127, 1% rHSA) and F2 (15% trehalose, 2% F127, 0.01% rHSA) were formulated in phosphate buffered saline. Formulation F3 (15% trehalose, 2% F127. 0.01% rHSA) was formulated in 10 mM Tris base.<br>
