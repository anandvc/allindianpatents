FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of inhibitors of protein kinases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyse the phosphorylation of<br>
specific residues in proteins. In general protein kinases fall into several groups; those<br>
which preferentially phosphorylate serine and /or threonine residues, those which<br>
preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those which phosphorylate both<br>
tyrosine and Ser/Thr residues. Protein kinases are therefore key elements in signal<br>
transduction pathways responsible for transducing extracellular signals, including the<br>
action of cytokines on their receptors, to the nuclei, triggering various biological events.<br>
The many roles of protein kinases in normal cell physiology include cell cycle control and<br>
cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, cell mobility and mitogenesis.<br>
Protein kinases include, for example, but are not limited to, members of the Protein<br>
Tyrosine Kinase family (PTKs), which in turn can be divided into the cytoplasmic PTKs<br>
and the receptor PTKs (RTKs). The cytoplasmic PTKS include the SRC family, (including:<br>
BLK; FGR; FYN; HCK; LCK; LYN; SRQYES and YRK); the BRK Family (including: BRK;<br>
FRK, SAD; and SRM); the CSK family (including: CSK and CTK); the BTK family,<br>
(including BTK; ITK; TEC; MKK2 and TXK), the Janus kinase family, (including: JAKI,<br>
JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2), the FAK family (including, FAK and PYK2); the Fes family<br>
(including FES and FER), the ZAP70 family (including ZAP70 and SYK); the ACK family<br>
(including ACK1 and ACK2); and the Abl family (including ABL and ARG). The RTK<br>
family includes the EGF-Receptor family (including, EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4); the<br>
Insulin Receptor family (including INS-R and IGF1-R); the PDGF-Receptor family<br>
(including PDGFRa, PDGFRp, CSF1R, KIT, FLK2); the VEGF-Receptor family<br>
(including; FLT1, FLK1 and FLT4); the FGF-Receptor family (including FGFR1, FGFR2,<br>
FGFR3 and FGFR4); the CCK4 family (including CCK4); the MET family (including<br>
MET and RON); the TRK family (including TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC); the AXL family<br>
(including AXL, MER, and SKY); the TIE/TEK family (including TIE and TIE2/TEK); the<br>
EPH family (including EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHA3, EPHA4, EPHA5, EPHA6, EPHA7,<br>
EPHA8, EPHB1, EPHB2, EPHB3, EPHB4, EPHB5, EPHB6); the RYK family (including<br>
RYK); the MCK family (including MCK and TYRO10); the ROS family (including ROS);<br>
the RET family (including RET); the LTK family (including LTK and ALK); the ROR<br>
family (including ROR1 and ROR2); The Musk family (including Musk); the LMR family<br>
including LMR1, LMR2 and LMR3); and the SuRTK106 family (including SuRTK106).<br>
Similarly, the serine /threonine specific kinases comprise a number of distinct<br>
sub-families, including; the extracellular signal regulated kinases, (p42/ERK2 and<br>
p44/ERKI); c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK); cAMP-responsive element-binding protein<br>
kinases (CREBK); cAMP-dependent kinase (CAPK); mitogen-activated protein<br>
kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPK and its relatives); stress-activated protein kinase<br>
p38/SAPK2; mitogen-and stress-activated kinase (MSK); protein kinases, PKA, PKB and<br>
PKC inter alia.<br>
Additionally, the genomes of a number of pathogenic organisms possess genes<br>
encoding protein kinases. For example, the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and<br>
viruses such as HPV and Hepatitis viruses appear to bear kinase related genes.<br>
Inappropriately high protein kinase activity has been implicated in many diseases<br>
resulting from abnormal cellular function. This might arise either directly or indirectly,<br>
for example by failure of the proper control mechanisms for the kinase, related for<br>
example to mutation, over-expression or inappropriate activation of the enzyme; or by<br>
over- or under-production of cytokines or growth factors also participating in the<br>
transduction of signals upstream or downstream of the kinase. In all of these instances,<br>
selective inhibition of the action of the kinase might be expected to have a beneficial effect.<br>
Diseases where aberrant kinase activity has been implicated include: diabetes; restenosis;<br>
atherosclerosis; fibrosis of the liver and kidney; ocular diseases; myelo- and<br>
lymphoproliferative disorders; cancer such as prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer,<br>
head and neck cancer, leukemia and lymphoma; and, auto-immune diseases such as<br>
Atopic Dermatitis, Asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn"s disease, psoriasis, Crouzon<br>
syndrome, achondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia.<br>
The JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) play a central role in the<br>
cytokine dependent regulation of the proliferation and end function of several important<br>
cell types of the immune system.<br>
A direct comparison of the four currently known mammalian JAK family members<br>
reveals the presence of seven highly conserved domains (Harpur et al, 1992). In seeking a<br>
nomenclature for the highly conserved domains characteristic of this family of PTKs, the<br>
classification used was guided by the approach of Pawson and co-workers (Sadovski et al,<br>
1986) in their treatment of the SRC homology (SH) domains. The domains have been<br>
enumerated accordingly with most C-terminal homology domain designated JAK<br>
Homology domain 1 (JH1). The next domain N-terminal to JH1 is the kinase-related<br>
domain, designated here as the JH2 domain. Each domain is then enumerated up to the<br>
JH7 located at the N-terminus. The high degree of conservation of these JAK homology<br>
(JH) domains suggests that they are each likely to play an important role in the cellular<br>
processes in which these proteins operate. However, the boundaries of the JAK<br>
homology domains are arbitrary, and may or may not define functional domains.<br>
Nonetheless, their delineation is a useful device to aid the consideration of the overall<br>
structural similarity of this class of proteins.<br>
The feature most characteristic of the JAK family of PTKs is the possession of two<br>
kinase-related domains (JH1 and JH2) (Wilks et al, 1991). The putative PTK domain of<br>
JAK1 (JH1) contains highly conserved motifs typical of PTK domains, including the<br>
presence of a tyrosine residue at position 1022 located 11 residues C-terminal to<br>
sub-domain VII that is considered diagnostic of membership of the tyrosine-specific class<br>
of protein kinases. Alignment of the human JAK1 PTK domain (255 amino acids), with<br>
other members of the PTK class of proteins revealed homology with other functional<br>
PTKs (for example, 28% identity with c-fes (Wilks and Kurban, 1988) and 37% homology<br>
to TRK (Kozma et al, 1988). The JH1 domains of each of the JAK family members possess<br>
a interesting idiosyncrasy within the highly conserved sub-domain VIII motif (residues<br>
1015 to 1027 in JAK2) that is believed to lie close to the active site, and define substrate<br>
specificity. The phenylalanine and tyrosine residues flanking the conserved tryptophan<br>
in this motif are unique to the JAK family of PTKs. Aside from this element, the JH1<br>
domains of each of the members of the JAK family are typical PTK domains.<br>
The central role played by the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases in the<br>
cytokine dependent regulation of the proliferation and end function of several important<br>
cell types means that agents which inhibit JAK are useful in the prevention and<br>
chemotherapy of disease states dependent on these enzymes. Potent and specific<br>
inhibitors of each of the currently known four JAK family members will provide a means<br>
of inhibiting the action of those cytokines that drive immune pathologies, such as asthma<br>
(e.g. IL-13; JAK1, JAK2), and leukemia/lymphoma (e.g. IL-2: JAK1 and JAK3).<br>
Furthermore, certain types of cancer such as prostate cancer develop autocrine<br>
production of certain cytokines as a selectable mechanism of developing growth and/or<br>
metastatic potential. An example of this is cancer of the prostate, where IL-6 is produced<br>
by and stimulates the growth of prostate cancer cell lines such as TSU and TC3 (Spiotto<br>
MT, and Chung TD, 2000). Interestingly, levels of IL-6 are elevated in sera of patients<br>
with metastatic prostate cancer.<br>
A great deal of literature covers the area of cytokine signalling. The present<br>
inventors have focussed on the JAK/STAT pathway that is involved in the direct<br>
connection of cytokine receptor to target genes (such as cell cycle regulators (e.g. p21) and<br>
anti-apoptosis genes (such as Bcl-XL)).<br>
The JAK/STAT Pathway<br>
The delineation of a particularly elegant signal transduction pathway downstream<br>
of the non-protein tyrosine kinase cytokine receptors has recently been achieved. In this<br>
pathway the key components are: (i) A cytokine receptor chain (or chains) such as the<br>
Interleukin-4 receptor or the Interferon y receptor; (ii) a member (or members) of the JAK<br>
family of PTKs; (iii) a member(s) of the STAT family of transcription factors, and (iv) a<br>
sequence specific DNA element to which the activated STAT will bind.<br>
A review of the JAK/STAT literature offers strong support to the notion that this<br>
pathway is important for the recruitment and marshalling of the host immune response to<br>
environmental insults, such as viral and bacterial infection. This is well exemplified in<br>
Table 1 and Table 2. Information accumulated from gene knock-out experiments have<br>
underlined the importance of members of the JAK family to the intracellular signalling<br>
triggered by a number of important immune regulatory cytokines. The therapeutic<br>
possibilities stemming from inhibiting (or enhancing) the JAK/STAT pathway are thus<br>
largely in the sphere of immune modulation, and as such are likely to be promising drugs<br>
for the treatment of a range of pathologies in this area. In addition to the diseases listed in<br>
Tables 1 and 2, inhibitors of JAKs could be used as immunosuppresive agents for organ<br>
transplants and autoimmune diseases such as lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, Type I diabetes, autoimmune thyroid disorders, Alzheimer"s disease and other<br>
autoimmune diseases. Additionally, treatment of cancers such as prostate cancer by JAK<br>
inhibitors is indicated.<br>

composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal<br>
or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other<br>
clinician.<br>
The term "composition" as used herein is intended to encompass a product<br>
comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product<br>
which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the<br>
specified amounts. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or<br>
excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not<br>
deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be<br>
understood to mean providing a compound of the invention to the individual in need of<br>
treatment<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this<br>
invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by<br>
any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of<br>
bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or<br>
more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by<br>
uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid<br>
carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product<br>
into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object<br>
compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the<br>
process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to<br>
encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as<br>
well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the<br>
specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a<br>
form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily<br>
suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups<br>
or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method<br>
known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such<br>
compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of<br>
sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to<br>
provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active<br>
ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are<br>
suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert<br>
diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or<br>
sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or<br>
alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents,<br>
for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they<br>
may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For<br>
example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may<br>
be employed. They may also be coated to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control<br>
release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein<br>
the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate,<br>
calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is<br>
mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending<br>
agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth<br>
and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide,<br>
for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for<br>
example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long<br>
chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation<br>
products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such<br>
as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with<br>
partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more<br>
preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring<br>
agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose<br>
or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral<br>
oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for<br>
example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set<br>
forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation.<br>
These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic<br>
acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a<br>
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already<br>
mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring<br>
agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of<br>
oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or<br>
arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable<br>
emulsifying agents may be naturally- occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum<br>
tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters<br>
or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan<br>
monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for<br>
example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain<br>
sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example<br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a<br>
demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous<br>
or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known<br>
art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have<br>
been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for<br>
example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that<br>
may be employed are water, Ringer"s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending<br>
medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic<br>
mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the<br>
preparation of intertables.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may also be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared<br>
by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary<br>
temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to<br>
release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing<br>
the compounds of the present invention are employed. (For purposes of this application,<br>
topical application shall include mouthwashes and gargles.)<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or<br>
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or mululamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically<br>
acceptable and metabolisable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The<br>
present compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the<br>
present invention, stabilisers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids<br>
are the phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines, both natural and synthetic. Methods to<br>
form liposomes are known in the art.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further<br>
comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually<br>
applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions. Selection of the<br>
appropriate agents for use in combination therapy may be made by one of ordinary skill<br>
in the art, according to conventional pharmaceutical principles. The combination of<br>
therapeutic agents may act synergistically to effect the treatment or prevention of the<br>
various disorders described above. Using this approach, one may be able to achieve<br>
therapeutic efficacy with lower dosages of each agent, thus reducing the potential for<br>
adverse side effects.<br>
Examples of other therapeutic agents include the following:<br>
cyclosporins (e.g., cyclosporin A), CTLA4-Ig, antibodies such as ICAM-3, anti-IL-2<br>
receptor (Anti-Tac), anti-CD45RB, anti-CD2, anti-CD3 (OKT-3), anti-CD4, anti-CD80,<br>
anti-CD86, agents blocking the interaction between CD40 and gp39, such as antibodies<br>
specific for CD40 and/or gp39 (i.e., CD154), fusion proteins constructed from CD40 and<br>
gp39 (CD401g and CD8gp39), inhibitors, such as nuclear translocation inhibitors, of<br>
NF-kappa B function, such as deoxyspergualin (DSG), cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors<br>
such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin and simvastatin), non-steroidal<br>
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen and<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as rofecoxib, steroids such as prednisolone or<br>
dexamethasone, gold compounds, antiproliferative agents such as methotrexate, FK506<br>
(tacrolimus, Prograf), mycophenolate mofetil, cytotoxic drugs such as azathioprine, VP-<br>
16, etoposide, fludarabine, cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, TNF-a inhibitors such as<br>
tenidap, anti-TNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptor, and rapamycin (sirolimus or<br>
Rapamune) or derivatives thereof.<br>
When other therapeutic agents are employed in combination with the compounds<br>
of the present invention they may be used for example in amounts as noted in the<br>
Physician Desk Reference (PDR) or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art.<br>
In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require protein tyrosine kinase<br>
inhibition an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 mg per kg<br>
patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses.<br>

Examples.<br>
MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
Compounds are generally prepared in a 2-step process starting from<br>
2,6-dichloropyrazine.<br>
The first step is a nudeophilic aromatic substitution to generate a<br>
monoamino-monohalo intermediate. (Scheme 1).<br><br>
The nudeophilic aromatic substitution is typically carried out by addition of a<br>
primary amine to the di-halogenated heterocyde in a solvent such as ethanol,<br>
isopropanol, tert-butanol, dioxane, THF, DMF, toluene or xylene. The reaction is typically<br>
performed at elevated temperature in the presence of excess amine or a non-nucleophilic<br>
base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or an inorganic base such as<br>
potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate.<br>
Alternatively, the amino substituent may be introduced through a transition metal<br>
catalysed amination reaction. Typical catalysts for such transformations include<br>
Pd(OAc)2/P(t-Bu)3, Pd2(dba)3/BINAP and Pd(OAc)2/BINAP.<br>
The amines employed in the first step of the synthesis of these compounds are<br>
obtained commercially or are prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the<br>
art. Of particular interest are a-methylbenzylamines which are obtained commercially or<br>
may be prepared through reduction of oximes (Scheme 2). Typical reductants include<br>
lithium aluminium hydride, hydrogen gas in the presence of catalytic palladium on<br>
charcoal, Zn in the presence of hydrochloric acid, sodium borohydride in the presence of<br>
a Lewis acid such as TiCl3, ZrCl4, NiCl2 and MoO3 or sodium borohydride in conjunction<br>
with Amberlyst H15 ion exchange resin and LiCl. The oximes are obtained in one-step<br>
from the corresponding ketones through condensation with hydroxylamine. This<br>
reaction is generally performed in a protic solvent such as water or ethanol, at<br>
temperatures from 0°C to reflux. The hydroxylamine is generally used in the form of its<br>
hydrochloride salt, and therefore the reaction is performed in the presence of a base such<br>
as sodium hydroxide. The ketones employed as starting materials are generally obtained<br>
commercially or via procedures well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
a-Methyl benzylamines of high optical purity may be prepared from chiral<br>
a-methyl benzyl alcohols using methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such<br>
methods include derivatisation of the hydroxyl as a mesylate or tosylate and<br>
displacement with a nitrogen nudeophile, such as phthalimide or azide which can then<br>
converted to the primary amine using conventional synthetic methods; or, displacement<br>
of the hydroxyl with a suitable nitrogen nucleophile under Mitsunobu conditions. The<br>
chiral a-methyl benzyl alcohols may be obtained through chiral reduction of the<br>
corresponding ketones. Chiral reducing methods are now well known in organic<br>
chemistry and include enzymatic processes, asymmetric hydrogenation procedures and<br>
chiral oxazaborolidines.<br>
The second step of the synthesis involves a nucleophilic aromatic substitution<br>
reaction of the monochloro- mono-amino pyrazine with imidazole, benzimidazole or<br>
indazole. The reaction is typically performed using a salt of the imidazole, benzimidazole<br>
or indazole in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, toluene, or xylene<br>
from room temperature to reflux. The imidazole, benzimidazole or indazole salt is<br>
prepared by reaction with a metal hydride such as sodium or potassium hydride or by<br>
reaction with caesium carbonate. Alternatively, a metal-catalysed coupling reaction can<br>
be used to introduce the imidazole, benzimidazole or indazole ring. The reaction is<br>
typically performed using a base such as caesium carbonate, rubidium carbonate,<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium tert-butoxide or potassium phosphate in a solvent such as<br>
xylene, toluene, and DMF from room temperature to reflux. Auxiliary reagents such as<br>
phase transfer agents (e.g. cetrimonium bromide) or copper complexing agents (e.g.<br>
phenanthroline) may also be employed in the reaction.<br>
The imidazole, benzimidazole or indazole components used in this reaction are<br>
obtained commercially or are prepared from commercially available imidazoles,<br>
benzimidazoles or indazoles via techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Alternatively, an imidazole, benzimidazole or indazole derivative may be reacted<br>
with the mono-amino mono-chloro pyrazine and the subsequent product further<br>
derivatised using methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>

To a stirred suspension of benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.40g, 2.50mmol) in<br>
benzene (8mL) was added thionyl chloride (2mL) dropwise at room temperature. The<br>
whole mixture was then heated under reflux for 5h. Benzene and thionyl chloride was<br>
evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained acid chloride was suspended in<br>
tetrohydrofuran. To this was the added 2-hydroxyethyl amine dropwise at ODC, and the<br>
resultant mixture was then stirred at room temperature overnight. The solvent was then<br>
decanted, and the residue was washed with diethyl ether (40mL). The residue oil was<br>
then treated with cold water (5mL), and the aqueous solution was carefully decanted.<br>

Large Scale Production Of Kinase Domains<br>
Baculovirus preparations from each of the JAK family members were infected into<br>
five litres of High Five cells (Invitrogen) grown in High Five serum free medium<br>
(Invitrogen) to a cell density of approximately 1-2 X 106 cells/ml. Cells are infected with<br>

column.<br>
Assay Protocols<br>
Kinase assays were performed either in a 96 well capture-based ELISA assay or in<br>
384 well Optiplates (Packard) using an Alphascreen Protein Tyrosine Kinase kit. In either<br>
casse using approximately 1.5 µg of affinity purified PTK domain in the presence of<br>
50mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10mM MgCl2, 150mM NaCl and 10µM-1mM ATP. The<br>
biotinylated substrate biotin-EGPWLEEEEEAYGWMDF-NH2 (final concentration 5µM)<br>
was used as substrate. In the ELISA assay tyrosine phosphorylation was quantitated<br>
following transfer to an avidin coated ELISA plate using peroxidase-linked<br>
anti-phospho-tyrosine antibody PY20. In the Alphascreen assay, Alphascreen<br>
phosphotyrosine acceptor beads followed by streptavidin donor beads were added under<br>

and JAK3, a Not I site was incorporated into the JAK2 reverse primer and a Xba I site was<br>
added to the reverse primer of JAK3.<br>
A TEL/Jak2 fusion was generated by digestion of the TELPCR product with<br>
BamH I /Sal I, digestion of the JAK2 PCR product with Sal I/ Not I followed by ligation<br>
and subcloning into the mammalian expression Vector pTRE 2 (Clontech) digested with<br>
BamH I-Not I (pTELJAK2). For JAK3 Sal I/ Not I cleaved kinase domain PCR product<br>
was ligated with BamH I /Sal I cleaved TELproduct followed by ligation into BamH<br>
I/Not I cleaved pTRE2 (pTELJAK3).<br>
The growth factor dependent myelomonocytic cell line BaF3 bearing the pTET-off<br>
plasmid (Clontech) was transfected with either pTELJAK2 or pTELJAK3 and the cells<br>
selected for factor independent growth. BaF 3 wild type cells were cultured in DMEM<br>
10% FCS, 10% WEHI 3B conditioned medium. BaF3 TELJAK cells were cultured in<br>
DMEM 10% Tet-System Approved FBS (without WEHI 3B conditioned medium).<br>
Cellular assays were performed as follows:<br>
Cell suspensions were prepared by harvesting cells from culture. (Cells used in<br>
this test should be in later log phase growth and high viability.) Cells were diluted in<br>
correct growth medium to 1.1x final concentration (from 50000 cell/mL to 200,000<br>
cell/mL, depending on cell line).<br>
Compounds to be tested were added (10µL, 10X final concentration) to a flat<br>
bottom 96-well plate. The cellular suspension (90µL per well) was added, and the plate<br>
incubated for 40 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2. MTT (20 µL per well, 5mg/ mL in PBS) was added<br>
and the plates were returned to the incubator for a further 6 hours. Lysis buffer (100 µL<br>
per well, 10% SDS, 0.01N HC1) was added and the plate stored in the incubator overnight.<br>
The plate was then read at 590 nm.<br>
