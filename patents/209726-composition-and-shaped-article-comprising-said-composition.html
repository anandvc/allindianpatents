COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"COMPOSITION AND SHAPED ARTICLE COMPRISING SAID COMPOSITION"<br>
We,   BAYER   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   a   body   corporate   organized under the laws of Germany, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularlyibTes'dribeis the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to befperformed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to composition and shaped article comprising said composition.<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri to R40	are the same or different.and are selected from the group consisting of<br>
H, alkyl, halogen and -CN,<br>
and products made therefrom.<br>
Polycarbonate sheets axe known, e.g. from EP-A 0 110 221, and are provided for a large number of applications. Production takes place, e.g. by extrusion of compositions containing polycarbonate and optionally co-extrusion with compositions containing polycarbonate that can contain an elevated proportion of UV absorbers.<br><br><br>
Products of compositions containing polycarbonate, such as e.g. spectacle lenses and plastic headlight lenses, are preferably made by injection moulding. Automobile glazing can be made by either injection moulding or extrusion, as desired.<br>
Important factors in the selection of transparent polycarbonate sheets are high light transmission and low haze. So that the UV portion of sunlight does not lead to severe yellowing of the sheets, the polycarbonate normally incorporates at least one UV stabiliser. In the case of transparent glazing, increased haze of the sheet leads to poorer visibility of objects behind it. The haze effect is optically more noticeable the thicker the sheet. Low haze is particularly important, for example, in automobile glazing.<br>
DE-A 1 670 951 teaches that UV absorbers based, e.g., on substituted benzotriazoles are used for stabilising polycarbonate against yellowing under the action of UV light.<br>
For long-term protection from yellowing by UV light, EP-A 0 320 632 teaches that the polycarbonate sheets should incorporate a co-extrusion layer containing low-volatility UV absorbers, especially dimeric benzotriazoles, such as e.g. Tinuvin 360 (bis[2-hydroxy-5-^err-octyl-3-(benzotriazol-2-yl)phenyl]methane), a product of Ciba Spezialitatenchemie, Basel, Switzerland, in a sufficiently high concentration.<br>
WO 96/15102 describes special UV absorbers, including those according to formula (I), which act as a light stabiliser or a stabiliser for organic materials, such as e.g. plastics.<br>
WO 96/15102 teaches that a content of 0.01 to 10 wt.% of the UV absorbers described there bring about UV protection in organic materials. However, nothing is said about the quality of the UV protection in polycarbonate. Also, no teaching is disclosed as to how low-haze compositions can be obtained.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of providing compositions that are stable towards UV radiation and exhibit high light transmission and low haze. Furthermore, products made from these compositions are to be provided.<br><br>
The object according to the invention is achieved by compositions containing<br>
a)	a transparent thermoplastic polymer and<br>
b)	one or more different compounds according to formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
Ri to R40	are the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of<br>
H, alkyl, halogen and -CN,<br>
and products made therefrom.<br>
The composition according to the invention preferably contains 0.08 to 0.6 wt.%, particularly preferably 0.1 to 0.3 wt.%, of the compounds according to formula (I).<br><br><br>
Ri to R40 preferably equal H (hydrogen).<br>
The transparent thermoplastic polymer according to the invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of polycarbonate, polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, polysulfone, styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, copolyesters of polyethylene terephthalate with cyclohexanedimethanol, copolyesters of polybutylene terephthalate with cyclohexanedimethanol, polyether sulfone, polyethylene, polypropylene and mixtures of the above polymers, those polymers and mixtures that can be processed into highly transparent, crystal clear products being preferred.<br>
The transparent thermoplastic polymer polycarbonate is especially preferred.<br>
Polycarbonates preferred according to the invention are polycarbonates based on bisphenol A, especially bisphenol A homopolycarbonate and copolycarbonates based on bisphenol A and l,l-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane.<br>
Particularly suitable transparent thermoplastic polymers are also copolycarbonates based on bisphenols, poly- or copolyacrylates and poly- or copolymethacrylates, such as e.g. poly- or copolymethyl methacrylate, copolymers with styrene, such as e.g. transparent polystyrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), and also transparent cycloolefms, poly- or copolycondensates of terephthalic acid, such as e.g. poly- or copolyethylene terephthalate (PET or CoPET or PETG).<br>
Examples of polyesters and copolyesters are described in EP-A 0 678 376, EP-A 0 595 413 and US-A 6 096 854.<br>
Further, the compositions according to the invention preferably also contain 0.01 to 1 wt.%, particularly preferably 0.04 to 0.7 wt.%, pentaerythritol tetrastearate or glycerol monostearate or fatty acid esters of Guerbet alcohols or mixtures thereof.<br>
-  5-<br><br>
The object according to the invention is also achieved by products containing the composition according to the above paragraphs.<br>
Products selected from the group consisting of sheets, solid sheets, multi wall sheets, corrugated sheets, glazing panels, greenhouses, conservatories, bus shelters, advertising panels, signs, safety screens, automobile glazing, windows, roofing, plastic headlight lenses and spectacle lenses are preferred.<br>
Products that are multi-layer, and in which at least one layer contains a sufficiently high content of a UV absorber that the layers below it are protected from the harmful effects of UV light, are also preferred. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is provided by the fact that the UV absorber contained in at least one layer is a compound according to formula (1). Another preferred embodiment of the present invention is provided by the fact that the UV absorber contained in at least one layer is another compound.<br>
Another preferred embodiment according to the invention is provided by the fact that the transparent thermoplastic polymer is a polymer blend consisting of at least 20 wt.% polycarbonate, the polymer blend also containing polyesters or polymethacrylates or both as blend partners in addition to polycarbonate.<br>
The compound according to formula (I) with Rj to R40 equal to H is commercially available as Uvinul® 3030 from BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany.<br>
The production of the compound according to formula (I) with Ri to R40 equal to H is described in WO 96/15102. The compounds according to formula (I) in which Ri to R40 have a different meaning can be produced by corresponding processes.<br>
Since the compounds according to formula (I) are of low volatility, it is possible to use them as described in EP-A 0 320 632 in compositions containing transparent thermoplastic polymers as UV protection for co-extruded sheets (use in co-extrusion moulding compositions).<br><br><br>
Surprisingly, it has been shown that, when the compounds according to formula (I) are used in concentrations of 0.08 to 0.6 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to 0.3 wt.%, the haze and light transmission are better than with the conventional benzotriazole UV absorbers.<br>
The polycarbonates according to the invention are homopolycarbonates, copolycarbonates  and  thermoplastic polyester carbonates.  They preferably  have<br>
average molecular weights M w of 18,000 to 40,000 g/mol, preferably of 20,000 to 36,000 g/mol and especially of 22,000 to 35,000 g/mol, determined by measuring the relative solution viscosity in dichloromethane or in mixtures of equal quantities by weight of phenol/o-dichlorobenzene calibrated by light scattering.<br>

The production of the polycarbonates for the compositions according to the invention by the melt transesterification process is described, for example, in DE-A 4 238 123.<br>
The incorporation of the UV absorbers into the compositions according to the invention takes place by conventional methods, e.g. by mixing solutions of the UV<br><br>
absorbers with solutions of the plastics in suitable organic solvents, such as CH2CI2, haloalkanes, halogenated aromatics, chlorobenzene and xylenes. The substance mixtures are then homogenised by known means, preferably by extrusion.

The compositions thus obtained can be converted to shaped objects (products), such as e.g. parts for toys, but also fibres, films, film tapes, solid sheets, multi wall sheets, corrugated sheets, vessels, pipes and other profiles, by the conventional methods, such as e.g. hot press moulding, spinning, extruding or injection moulding. The compositions can also be processed into cast films.<br>
The invention thus also relates to the use of the compositions according to the invention for the production of a shaped object (products). The use of multi-layer systems is also of interest.<br>
The invention also provides products that have been made incorporating the compositions according to the invention. The compositions according to the invention can be used for the production of solid plastic sheets and multi wall sheets (e.g. twin wall sheets, triple wall sheets etc.). The sheets also include those having an additional outer layer with an increased content of UV absorbers on one side or on both sides.<br>
The compositions according to the invention enable products to be made with improved optical properties, especially sheets and products made from them, such as e.g. glazing (solid sheets, multi wall sheets and corrugated sheets) and structural parts in the building sector and in the automotive sector, and also plastic headlight lenses and spectacle lenses and lamp housings, lamp covers, housings for the electronics industry, bottles and films.<br>
Subsequent treatments of the products made with the compositions according to the invention, such as e.g. thermoforming or surface treatments, e.g. coating with scratch resistant paints, water-spreading coatings, vapour deposition, sputtering, laminating with films or sheets and similar, are possible and the products made by these processes are also provided by the patent.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, without being limited to these.<br>
-/v-<br><br>
Examples<br>
To prepare the test pieces for tests A to H, a polycarbonate with the trade name Makrolon® 3108 (linear bisphenol A polycarbonate from Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, with a melt flow index (MFR) of 6.5 g/10 min at 300°C and 1.2 kg load) was compounded with the specified quantity of UV absorber at 310°C on a twin screw extruder and then granulated. Rectangular sheets (60 mm x 40 mm x 3 mm) were then made from these granules by injection moulding.<br>
The weathering of these sheets took place in a Weather-o-meter from Atlas, USA, with a 6.5 W xenon burner in a cycle of 102 min illumination and 18 min spraying with demineralised water with illumination. The maximum black panel temperature was 60°C (± 5°C).<br>
The light transmission, the yellowness index and the haze were determined in accordance with ASTM specification D 1003 using Haze-Gard plus apparatus from BYK-Gardner GmbH, D-82538 Geretsried.<br>

F	0.2% Uvinul* 3030	1.2	86.0%<br>

Tinuvin® 350=	2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-4-( 1,1 -dimethylethyl)-6-(2-methyl-<br>
propyl)phenol<br>
Uvinul® 3030 =	formula (I) with R, to R40 equal to H.<br>
The result shows that the injection moulded sheets incorporating Uvinul 3030 have lower haze values and better light transmission values than the injection moulded sheets incorporating Tinuvin® 350. This is true at least in a range of concentration of 0.1to0.3wt%.<br>
At concentrations of Uvinul® 3030 that are too high (0.8%), the haze becomes too great. Polycarbonate sheets with such high haze are no longer usable.<br>
Table 2:<br>
Development of the yellowness index and haze with artificial weathering (Xe-WOM), (cycles: 102 min irradiation; 18 min irradiation + water spray)<br>
-It-<br><br>
		Yellowness index	<br>
No.	Oh	5000 h	8000 h<br>
B	4.9	17.3	22.4<br>
F	4.9	16.4	21.5<br>
H	4.1	21.4	29.3<br>
The result shows that B and F are very similar in their weathering behaviour. H is striking for its excessively marked yellowing. These polycarbonate sheets are not suitable for glazing. The concentration of 0.02 wt.% Uvinul® 3030 is too low for adequate UV stabilising.<br>
