2. Applicant(a)	NAME :         LARSEN &amp; TOUBRO LIMITED(b)	NATIONALITY: An Indian Company(c)	ADDRESS : L&amp;T House, Ballard Estate, Mumbai 400 001,State of Maharashtra, India<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
FIBLD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for movement and interlocking of power contacts. The invention particularly, relates to a mechanism adapted to move and interlock power contacts, in switchboard feeders, from Service to Test position and vice-a-versa, with door closed and without any movement of the feeder with respect to the structure of the switchboard.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
In present scenario power contacts of the switchboard feeder assembly are mounted on the feeder frame itself. Hence for movement of power contacts from one functional position "Service" to another functional position "Test", feeder frame itself is required to move with respect to switchboard structure. Also in present feeder system the door of the feeder is not integral with the feeder frame, but is hinged to the structure. Hence for the movement of the feeder frame the door is required to be opened up which can also violet ingredients protection. Also the operator may get exposed to any live component making the situation hazardous.<br>
US5,680,926 deals with a mechanical interlock mechanism for operating an electrical wiring device with an electrical connector assembly. The mechanical interlock mechanism comprises an operating handle effectively locked by the interlock mechanism such that the handle cannot be rotated<br>
2<br><br>
to activate the switch and energize the terminals of the electrical connector.<br>
In the existing technologies and the prior art no such mechanism for providing rotation motion preceding transitional linear motion has been found for providing safe mechanical interlocking while engagement and disengagement of power contacts without moving the feeder and with door of the assembly remaining in closed position.<br>
In existing feeders door is not the part of feeder frame, but it is hinged onto the structure. Feeder frame is fixed to guide rails, which are mounted on the tray. Feeder frame is also attached to a nut fixed on the tray through a lead screw fixed into it. Also power contacts are fixed to the frame Hence, contacts cannot be moved keeping the feeder frame fixed. To move contacts to test position the whole feeder frame has to be withdrawn by rotating the lead screw The lead screw requires considerable number of rotations for the particular movement and takes time. Also lead screw is accessible only when the door is open. While removing the feeder frame contacts may get exposed to the user.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide for a mechanism adapted to move and interlock power contacts, in switchboard feeders, from Service to Test position and vice-a-versa with safety without moving the feeder.<br>
The present inventors have found that by way of providing plurality of slot profiles with unique constructions so as to provide appropriate rotational movement preceding transitional linear movement in the actuator means it is<br>
3<br><br>
possible to achieve mechanical interlocking in contactor system .<br>
OBJECTS OF INVNETION<br>
Thus one object of the present invention is to provide a mechanism for mechanical interlocking of power contact during engagement and disengagement of power contacts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide movement of power contact from Service to Test position and vice-a-versa.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide movement of power contact with door in closed condition.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to keep feeder static with respect to the structure of switchboard.<br>
Yet one more object of the present invention is to provide higher level of safety during movement of the power contacts.<br><br>
The other object of the .present invention is to provide quick and easy operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a mechanism adapted to move and interlock power contacts in switchboard feeders, said mechanism comprising<br>
4<br><br>
feeder frame means;<br>

chamber means<br>
Wherein said hollow chamber means comprises plurality of slot means located on the chamber in a manner to co-operate With interlocking means operatively and movably located on feeder frame<br>
wherein said slot means being angularly extended so as to provide desired rotation followed by transitional linear motions of rod means to move and interlock at desired positions required during operation of power contacts.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In the mechanism of the present invention both male and female power contacts have transitional linear motion and a rotational movement for the defeat of interlock while they are being engaged or disengaged as in the previous case. The rotational movement always precedes transitional motion both while engagement and disengagement of power contacts.<br>
5<br><br>
Actuating means comprises a handle, which is the part of the mechanism projecting out of feeder door. This handle can be operated to achieve both above-mentioned rotational and transitional motion keeping the door closed. It<br>
minimizes chances of the exposure of the any live components to the operator and also ingredients protection. Hence ensures the safety of the operator.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the overall view of the assembly. Mechanism is mounted in the feeder frame. Feeder frame consists of feeder frame and an integral door. Mechanism (8) is guided through the bush (1) mounted on the front face of the frame (2). Motion guides (9), are mounted in the feeder frame, over which Contact mounting back moves. Two numbers of latches (3) are used as interlocks in service and test positions. Latches are pivoted on the latch pin (5), which is fixed to the latch bracket (4) (also shown in the enlarged view Detail A) . Two latches (3) (also shown in the enlarged view Detail A) are assembled reciprocally in such a way that they are mirror of each other with respect to the axis of the latch pin (5). Both latches (3) are separated by latch sleeve (6) (also shown in the enlarged view Detail A). Latches (3) are preloaded with latch spring (7) . Latch springs (7) (also shown in the enlarged view Detail A) are torsion springs. Hence, latches (3) are rotated about the latch pin (5) against the force of latch spring (7).<br>
Figure 2 shows details of mechanism (8) with its components in exploded condition. Handle (10) is fixed to rod (11) by two act pins (12) . Rod (11) is inserted into the barrel (13). Act pins (12) at Q, O, and P on the rod are trapped with slots at A, B, and C on the barrel (13) respectively. Barrel (13), mechanism (8) and slots at A, B and C are also 4hown in the enlarged view marked as Detail B.<br>
7<br><br>
Figure 3 reveals slots (A, B, &amp; C) on the barrel (13) . Sectional views are shown in figures marked as Detail 3A and Detail 3B showing the horizontal line H. Slots (A, B &amp; C) are circumferential. As shown is figures 4a, 4b and 4c slot at section A extends 90° in clockwise direction from the horizontal reference plane "H", slot at section B extends 90° in anticlockwise direction from the horizontal reference plane WH" and slot at section C extends 30° in clockwise direction from the horizontal reference plane<br>
As shown in figure 3 rod (11) is free to rotate inside the barrel (13) through 30°. Power contacts (14) are fixed to Contact mounting back (15), which in turn is fixed to the other end of the barrel (13) through cylindrical insert (16) . Hence, any axial movement of the handle (10) will be transmitted to power contacts (14), which are mounted on Contact mounting back (15).<br>
Working:!<br>
Initially power contacts are in service position and top latch (3) is engaged with the slot at section A in the barrel, thus preventing the undesirable movement of the handle and power contacts. To move power contacts to the test position, handle is turned in clockwise direction to defeat the top latch. Rotating handle rotates the act pin, at section A in the barrel, which will force the top latch out of the slot at section A in barrel to free the axial movement of the handle. The movement of the handle in outward direction is imparted to power contacts. Hence, power contacts get disengaged and move relative to the<br>
8<br><br>
feeder frame. Movement continues till the bottom latch gets engaged with the slot at section B in the barrel. Engagement of the bottom latch with the slot at section B in the barrel prevents further travel of handle and thus ensures the arrival of test position.<br>
For movement  of power contacts  from Test position to<br>
service  position,  handle  is  turned  in  anticlockwise<br>
direction to defeat the bottom latch.  Rotating handle<br>
Rotates the act pin, at section B in the barrel, which will force the bottom latch out of the slot at section B in<br>
barrel to free the axial movement  of the handle.  The<br>
movement of the handle in inward direction is imparted to<br>
power contacts. Hence, power contacts move relative to the<br>
feeder frame and engage with their counter part. Movement<br>
Continues till the top latch gets engaged with the slot at<br>
Section A in the barrel. Engagement of the top latch with<br>
the slot at section A in the barrel prevents further travel<br>
of handle and thus ensures the arrival of service position.<br>
Advantages :<br>
[1].  Withdrawal of power contacts from service to test position with door closed.<br>
2.	Interlocks  to  prevent  accidental  movement  and distinguished positions.<br>
3.	Higher level of safety.<br>
4.	Increased ingredient protection level.<br>
5.	Quick and easy by simple push/pull operation.<br>
