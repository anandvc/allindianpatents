				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to the process for preparation of constructional blocks,<br>
bricks and artificial ceramic stone chips utilizing red mud as the main base<br>
material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Bauxite is digested with caustic soda in the Bayer process for producing alumina<br>
try hydrate by dissolution of the alumina content of the bauxite followed by<br>
refining. The undigested bauxite containing iron oxide, certain quantity of un-<br>
reacted alumina and other materials viz: silica, titanium dioxide and residual<br>
caustic soda (alkali); is removed as the waste material called as red mud. Since<br>
red mud contains residual alkali to the tune of 2-4% Na2O, it is safely stored in a<br>
pond from the environment point of view which is the practice followed by all the<br>
alumina producers. For every ton of alumina produced about 1.2 to 1.4 ton of red<br>
mud is generated in the alumina plant. As on date, no commercial utilization of<br>
red mud has been possible in India, even though several attempts have been<br>
made to find a suitable utilization of the same. In the present invention, efforts<br>
have been made to develop a process for preparation of constructional blocks,<br>
bricks, artificial ceramic stone chips and similar range of products utilizing red<br>
mud as the main base material for its bulk utilization.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to prepare constructional blocks, bricks, artificial<br>
ceramic stone chips utilizing red mud as the main base material;<br><br><br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of dense<br>
and hollow constructional blocks, bricks using red mud.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for the preparation of<br>
artificial stone chips of different sizes using red mud.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of<br>
dense and hollow constructional blocks, bricks of different shapes and sizes and<br>
artificial ceramic stone ships using red mud as the main base material along with<br>
other additives and further processing the mixture.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparing<br>
constructional materials comprising the steps of:<br>
mixing 60 to 80% red mud, 20-30% plastic clay (or similar material), 5-10% soap<br>
stone and required quantity of water to form a formable paste;<br>
subjecting the said paste to the step of extrusion in the form of constructional<br>
materials if required shape and size;<br>
air drying the constructional materials for 60-80 hrs or drying below 150째C for 2<br>
to 4 hrs;<br>
subjecting the dried constructional materials to the step of heat treatment at a<br>
temperature range of 900-1150째C for 1 to 3 hrs;<br>
crushing and grinding the constructional materials in crusher and grinder to form<br>
artificial ceramic stone chips for desired size and shape.<br><br><br>
Method of preparation:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the preparation of<br>
constructional blocks, bricks and artificial ceramic stone chips utilizing red mud<br>
as the main base material which comprises mixing of 60-80% red mud (as is<br>
basis, containing 15-25% moisture), 20-30% plastic clay (or similar high siliceous<br>
clay material) and 5-10% soap stone or talk powder. Mixing is carried out for 15-<br>
60 minutes with required quantity of water to form a formable paste. The mix is<br>
extruded in the form of either dense or hollow brick or block of required shape<br>
and is wire cut to the required dimensions for further heat treatment.<br>
In accordance with the above method red mud generated from the alumina plant<br>
(60-80%), plastic clay (20-30%), soap stone or talk powder (5-10%) are<br>
thoroughly mixed for 15-60 minutes using required water and extruded in the<br>
form of dense or hollow blocks of required size and shape and wire cut to the<br>
required length to produce the clots. The clots are subjected to air drying for 60-<br>
80 hours. The drying can also be carried out by passing hot air below 150 deg. C<br>
temperature till free moisture is removed from the clots. The clots are heat<br>
treated at a temperature of 900 to 1300 deg. C with soaking period of 1-3 hours<br>
at the peak temperature to prepare the blocks or bricks for constructional<br>
application.<br>
The dense blocks are further subjected to crushing and grinding to the desired<br>
sizes for preparing artificial ceramic chips for construction application. The bricks<br>
and artificial ceramic stone chips prepared as above are characterized and<br>
compared with the standard specifications to establish its application for<br>
constructional purpose.<br><br><br>
To achieve the optimum experimental conditions in preparing constructional<br>
blocks, bricks and artificial ceramic chips utilizing red mud as the main base<br>
material, the following process parameters are studied:<br>
a)	Red mud (60-80%) (as is basis with about 15-25% moisture), plastic clay<br>
(20-30%), soap stone/talk powder (5-10%) are mixed in a Muller mixer for<br>
15-60 minutes with required quantity of water to form a paste mass (Mix).<br>
b)	The Mix is extruded in the form of dense or hollow blocks of desired size<br>
which are wire cut for constructional building blocks and similarly dense<br>
block/briquette for artificial ceramic stone chips.<br>
c)	The clots are air dried for 60-80 hours or by passing hot air below 150<br>
deg.C for 2-4 hrs.<br>
d)	Heat treatment is carried out in a kiln at 900-1150 deg.C for 1-3 hours<br>
soaking at peak temp, for constructional building blocks and at 1150-1300<br>
deg.C for 1-3 hours soaking at peak temp, for artificial ceramic stone<br>
chips.<br>
e)	For artificial ceramic stone chips, fired dense blocks/briquettes are<br>
crushed and ground into desired sizes using suitable crusher/grinder.<br>
Typical characteristics of main raw material, red mud are reported in table 1.<br>
Similarly, the typical characteristics of the final products viz: building blocks/<br>
bricks and artificial ceramic stone chips prepared in this method are reported in<br>
comparison to the standard specification in table 2 and 3 respectively.<br><br><br><br><br>
The following examples illustrate the exact process of preparation of<br>
constructional blocks, bricks and artificial ceramic stone chips utilizing red mud<br>
as the main base material.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
65 gm of red mud containing 20% water was mixed with 25 gm of plastic clay<br>
and 10 gm of soap stone powder for 30 minutes to prepare a homogeneous<br>
paste. The mix was extruded and wire cut to dense clots of standard brick size<br><br>
(10" x 5" x 3"). The clots were air dried for 70 hrs to remove excess moisture after<br>
which they are heat treated at 1025 deg.C for 2.5 hours soaking time. The<br>
resulted product that is the brick prepared as above has been characterized to<br>
have a cold crushing strength (CCS) of 230 kg/cm2, water absorption of 17% and<br>
bulk density of 2.15 gm/cc quite comparable with the standard specification.<br>
EXAMPLE-2:<br>
70 gm of red mud containing 18% water was mixed with 25gm of plastic clay and<br>
5 gm of soap powder for 60 minutes to prepare a homogeneous paste. The mix<br>
was extruded and wire cut to hollow clots (two holes each 3" diameter with three<br>
inch gap between the holes) of standard brick size (10" x 5" x 3"). The clots were<br>
air dried for 60 hrs to remove excess moisture after which they are heat treated<br>
at 1100 deg.C for 2 hours soaking time. The resulted product that is the hollow<br>
brick prepared as above has been characterized to have a cold crushing strength<br>
(CCS) of 218 kg/cm2, water absorption of 14% and bulk density of 2.05 gm/cc<br>
quite comparable with the standard specification.<br>
EXAMPLE-3:<br>
70 gm of red mud containing 25% water was mixed with 22 gm of plastic clay<br>
and 8 gm of soap powder for 30 minutes to prepare a homogeneous paste. The<br>
mix was extruded and wire cut to dense clots of a block size of 100" x 10" x 10".<br>
The clots were air dried for 75 hrs to remove excess moisture after which they<br>
are heat treated at 1200 deg.C for 3 hours soaking time. The block are crushed<br>
and ground to 1" size chips. The resulted product (artificial ceramic stone chips)<br>
prepared as above has been characterized to have water absorption of 4.5% and<br><br>
bulk density of 2.27 gm/cc and apparent porosity of 9.5% quite comparable with<br>
the standard specification.<br><br>
