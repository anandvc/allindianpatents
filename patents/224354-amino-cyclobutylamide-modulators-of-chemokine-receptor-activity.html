				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
AMINO CYCLOBUTYLAMDDE MODULATORS OF CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR<br>
ACTIVITY<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The chemokines are a family of small (70-120 ammo acids), proinflammatory cytokines, with potent chemotactic activities. Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines that are released by a wide variety of cells to attract various cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils to sites of inflammation (reviewed in Schall, Cytokine. 3,165-183 (1991) and Murphy, Rev. Immun.. 12, 593-633 (1994)). These molecules were originally defined by four conserved cysteines and divided into two subfamilies based on the arrangement of the first cysteine pair.   In the CXC-chemokine family, which includes IL-8, GROα, NAP-2 and HMO, these two cysteines are separated by a single amino acid, while in the CC-chemokine family, which includes RANTES, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MlP-lα, MIP-1β and eotaxin, these two residues are adjacent.<br>
The a-chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating protein-2 (NAP-2) and melanoma growth stimulatory activity protein (MGSA) are chemotactic primarily for neutrophils, whereas βα-chemokines, such as RANTES, MlP-lα, MIP-1β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-2, MCP-3 and eotaxin are chemotactic for macrophages, monocytes, T-cells, eosinophils and basophils (Deng, et al., Nature. 381, 661-666 (1996)).<br>
The chemokines are secreted by a wide variety of cell types and bind to specific G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) (reviewed in Horuk, Trends Pharm. Sci.. 15, 159-165 (1994)) present on leukocytes and other cells. These chemokine receptors form a sub-family of GPCRs, which, at present, consists of fifteen characterized members and a number of orphans. Unlike receptors for promiscuous chemoattractants such as C5a, fMLP, PAF, and LTB4, chemokine receptors are more selectively expressed on subsets of leukocytes. Thus, generation of specific chemokines provides a mechanism for recruitment of particular leukocyte subsets.<br>
On binding their cognate ligands, chemokine receptors transduce an intracellular signal though the associated trimeric G protein, resulting in a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration. There are at least seven human chemokine receptors that bind or respond to p-chemokines with the following characteristic pattern: CCR-1 (or "CKR-1" or "CC-CKR-1") [MlP-la, MIP-1β,<br>
MCP-3, RANTES] (Ben-Barruch, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270, 22123-22128 (1995); Beote, et al, Cell, 72, 415-425 (1993)); CCR-2A and CCR-2B (or "CKR-2ATCKR-2A" or "CC-CKR-2AT'CC-CKR-2A") [MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4]; CCR-3 (or "CKR-3" or "CC-CKR-3") [Eotaxin, Eotaxin 2, RANTES, MCP-2, MCP-3] (Rollins, et al., Blood, 90, 908-928 (1997)); CCR-4 (or "CKR-4" or "CC-CKR-4") [MlP-la, RANTES, MCP-1] (Rollins, et at., Blood, 90, 908-928 (1997)); CCR-5 (or "CKR-5" or "CC-CKR-5") [MlP-lα, RANTES, MIP-1β] (Sanson, et al., Biochemistry. 35, 3362-3367 (1996)); and the Duffy blood-group antigen [RANTES, MCP-1] (Chaudhun, et at., J. Biol. Chem.. 269, 7835-7838 (1994)). The β-chemokines include eotaxin, MIP ("macrophage inflammatory protein"), MCP ("monocyte chemoattractant protein") and RANTES ("regulation-upon-activation, normal T expressed and secreted") among other chemokines.<br>
Chemokine receptors, such as CCR-1, CCR-2, CCR-2A, CCR-2B, CCR-3, CCR-4, CCR-5, CXCR-3, CXCR-4, have been implicated as being important mediators of inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, including asthma, rhinitis and allergic diseases, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Humans who are homozygous for the 32-basepair deletion in the CCR-5 gene appear to have less susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (Gomez, et al., Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism. 42, 989-992 (1999)). A review of the role of eosinophils in allergic inflammation is provided by Kita, H., et al., J. Exp. Med. 183, 2421-2426 (1996). A general review of the role of chemokines in allergic inflammation is provided by Lustger, A.D., New England J. Med.. 338(7), 426-445 (1998).<br>
A subset of chemokines are potent chemoattractants for monocytes and macrophages. The best characterized of these is MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), whose primary receptor is CCR2. MCP-1 is produced in a variety of cell types in response to inflammatory stimuli in various species, including rodents and humans, and stimulates chemotaxis in monocytes and a subset of lymphocytes. In particular, MCP-1 production correlates with monocyte and macrophage infiltration at inflammatory sites.  Deletion of either MCP-1 or CCR2 by homologous recombination in mice results in marked attenuation of monocyte recruitment in response to thioglycollate injection and Listeria monocytogenes infection (Lu et al., J. Exp. Med.. 187, 601-608 (1998); Kurihara et al. J. Exp. Med.. 186, 1757-1762 (1997); Boring et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 100, 2552-2561 (1997); Kuziel et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. 94, 12053-12058 (1997)). Furthermore, these animals show reduced<br>
monocyte infiltration into granulomatous lesions induced by the injection of schistosomal or mycobacterial antigens (Boring et al. J. Clin. Invest., 100, 2552-2561 (1997); Warmington et al. Am J. Path.. 154,1407-1416 (1999)). These data suggest that MCP-1-induced CCR2 activation plays a major role in monocyte recruitment to inflammatory sites, and that antagonism of this activity will produce a sufficient suppression of the immune response to produce therapeutic benefits in irnmunoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.<br>
Accordingly, agents which modulate chemokine receptors such as the CCR-2 receptor would be useful in such disorders and diseases.<br>
In addition, the recruitment of monocytes to inflammatory lesions in the vascular wall is a major component of the pathogenesis of atherogenic plaque formation. MCP-1 is produced and secreted by endothelial cells and intimal smooth muscle cells after injury to the vascular wall in hypercholesterolemic conditions. Monocytes recruited to the site of injury infiltrate the vascular wall and differentiate to foam cells in response to the released MCP-1. Several groups have now demonstrated that aortic lesion size, macrophage content and necrosis are attenuated in MCP-1 -/- or CCR2 -/- mice backcrossed to APO-E -/-, LDL-R -/- or Apo B transgenic mice maintained on high fat diets (Boring et al. Nature. 394, 894-897 (1998); Gosling et al. J. Clin. Invest.. 103, 773-778 (1999)). Thus, CCR2 antagonists may inhibit atherosclerotic lesion formation and pathological progression by impairing monocyte recruitment and differentiation in the arterial wall.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to compounds which are modulators of chemokine receptor activity and are useful in the prevention or treatment of certain inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases, allergic diseases, atopic conditions including allergic rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, as well as autoimmune pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases in which chemokine receptors are involved.<br>

The compounds of the instant invention have at least two asymmetric centers at the 1- and 3-positions of the cyclobutyl ring. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The absolute configurations of selected compounds of this orientation, with substituents on the cyclopentyl ring (amide and amine units), are as depicted below: <br>

The independent syntheses of diastereomers and enantiomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br>
Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are made by known procedures or as illustrated.  (Formula Removed)  scheme 1<br><br>
The preparation of compounds within the scope of the instant invention which bear a 1,1,3-trisubstituted cyclobutane framework is detailed in Scheme 1. Keto-acid 1-1 (the preparation of which is described in Scheme 2) can first   <br><br>
be protected as the corresponding ester, where R27 represents an alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl or benzyl which serves as a protecting group (Greene, T; Wuts, P. G. M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, NY 1991). Reductive animation of 1-2 with an amine preferably of the from 1-3 (a preparation of which is depicted in Scheme 3) in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborhydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride gives amino-ester 1-4. Conversion of ester 1-4 to the carboxylic acid 1-5 can be achieved by a number of conditions depending on the nature of the ester. For example, methyl or ethyl esters can be readily saponified with sodium hydroxide, or lithium hydroxide; tert-butyl ester can be removed by treatment with TFA. Coupling of the acid 1-5 with amine 1-6 (a preparation of which is described in Scheme 4), to give chemokine modulators of the form 1-7, can be accomplished by the standard amide bond formation conditions using a coupling reagent such as DCC, EDC and a catalyst such as DMAP, HOBT or HO AT. Alternativly 1-1 can be directly coupled to amine 1-6 to give the keto-amide 1-8. Reductive animation with amine 1-3 in the presence of a borohydride such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride then provides the chemokine modulator 1-7.<br>
SCHEME 1A<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 1A depicts the preparation of chemokine modulators of the form 1-14. Intennediate 2-2a (described in Scheme 2) is first reduced to the primary amine 1-9 by catalytic hydrogenation using Raney nickel. Protection of the amine with the appropriate protecting group, such as a tert-butylcarbamate, by treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate followed by reductive animation with amine 1-3 gives intermediate 1-11. Removal of the protecting group, with for example HC1 in dioxane or TFA for the boc protected amine gives the free amine 1-12. Acylation of the amine with an acid chloride (1-13) gives the chemokine modulator 1-14. Alternatively the amine can be coupled (as described in Scheme 1) to an appropriate benzoic acid (not shown) to give similar amides 1-14.<br>
SCHEME 2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
As depicted in Scheme 2, the keto cyclobutanoic acid (1-1) can be readily synthesized from commercially available materials. The initial protected<br>
intermediates of the form 2-2 can be made by a double alkylation reaction of an active ester (2-lb) or nitrile (2-la) with 1,3-dibromo 2,2-dimethoxypropane, using a base such as sodium hydride. Removal of the dimethyl acetal and the hydrolysis of the ester or nitrile can be accomplished under acidic conditions in one reaction step to give intermediate 1-1. In the case where Rl is an ester functionality (2-lc) this hydrolysis is accompanied by decarboxylation to give the simple (Rl = H) keto-cyclobutane (1-lc). The ketone (1-lc) can be reprotected as the dimethyl acetal using trimethyl orthoformate with an acid catalyst in an appropriate solvent. When this solvent is methanol, the reaction is accompanied by esterification of the carboxylic acid to give 2-4 (where R27 is a methyl group). Alkylation of 2-4 with an alkyl halide or an aldehyde or ketone (to give an appropriate aldol product) gives intermediates 2-5. The deprotection of the ketone and hydrolysis of the ester can again be achieved in one step under acidic conditions to give 1-1.<br>
Amines 1-3 were obtained from various sources. Some were commercially available, some were known from the literature and could be prepared according to published procedures, and some were prepared as described herein. Since their structures and the methods for their preparation are diverse, only one Scheme will be outlined in this section; individual syntheses of amines 1-3 can be found in the Experimental Section. Scheme 3 shows one method for the synthesis of 4-aryl substituted piperidines as well as 4-aryl-3-alkyl-piperidines. Enol Inflate 3-1 (prepared according to Wustrow, D. J., Wise, L. D., Synthesis, (1991), 993-995.) could be coupled to boronic acids 3-2 as described by Wustrow and Wise. Hydrogenation of the olefin in 4-3 could be achieved using hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd(OH)2/C. Oxidation of 3-4 using Ru(IV)oxide hydrate and<br>
sodium periodate leads to Boc-lactam 3-5. Alkylation with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as LDA gives 3-6, with the trans product being predominant. Removal of the Boc protecting group could be achieved using standard acidic conditions, such as HC1 in dioxane or TFA/DCM. Reduction of the lactam 3-7 with, for example borane provides 1-3.2. Alternatively, intermediate 3-4 can itself be deprotected under acidic conditions to afford piperidine 1-3.1.<br>
SCHEME 3<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Amines of the form 1-6 are synthesized in a variety of ways.   An example of such a synthesis is depicted in Scheme 4. According to this, the commercially available 3-trifluoromethyl-5-amino bromobenzene (4-1) is converted to the corresponding nitrile using zinc cyanide in the presence of palladium, and a Sandmeyer reaction is then used to produce the respective halide 6-3, R3 = Cl, I. The reduction of the nitrile in the presence of an aromatic halide to the corresponding amine can be successfully accomplished e.g. with borane in THF.<br>
SCHEME 4<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Another example, which describes a synthesis of a pyridylmethylamine is detailed in Scheme 5. According to this, the commercially available 5-trifluoromethyl-2-pyridinaI (5-1) is brominated in acetic acid and the aromatic bromide is converted to the respective aldehyde 5-3 by transmetalation and quench with dimethyl formamide. Dehydration of the corresponding oxime yields the required nitrile (5-4) and then phosphoryl chloride is used to produce the respective aromatic chloride. The simultaneous reduction of the nitrile and chloride to yield 5-6 can be accomplished with catalytic hydrogenation, preferably with Raney nickel and elevated pressure.<br>
