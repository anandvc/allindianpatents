FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to measurement of residual stress and ,in particular,<br>
to a simple and accurate direct measurement of residual stress which is the locked<br>
in stress present in free body on which there is no external load or thermal gradient.<br>
It is possible by way of the above method to sense / measure the actual<br>
compression / tension caused by residual stress by simple and effective use of strain<br>
gauge which makes it possible to carry out direct measurement of stress. The<br>
method also favours obtaining bulk residual stress of the sample by cutting the<br>
same into small slice such that the total stress of the sample is released. The<br>
method avoids the limitations of conventional residual stress measurement<br>
techniques including X-ray diffraction method, Barkhausen Noise method and the<br>
Ultrasonic method presently followed in the art<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE ART<br>
It is known that residual stress comprise of the locked in stress present in free body<br>
on which there is no external load or thermal gradient. It is usually caused by<br>
several stress generating conditions such as casting, welding, grinding, machining,<br>
heat treatment, rolling, non-uniform cooling of structural and straightening of<br>
structural.<br>
Importantly, it is found that there are several effects of such residual stresses<br>
wherein combined with applied load and environment it causes failure at load much<br>
below the designed load. Residual stress is also found to enhance the fatigue failure<br>
and even influences the dimensional stability.<br>
There are various well known methods for measurement of residual stress such as<br>
those discussed hereunder.<br>
X-ray diffraction method is one of the most widely used non-destructive method for<br>
evaluating residual stresses. It is based on lattice strains, the changes in the spacing<br>
between crystallographic lattice planes, which are caused by stress. The<br>
disadvantages of such method are several which include as the volume of the<br>
surface materia! interrogated by the X-ray beam is small, and the lattice strain<br><br>
which is measured reflects the combined influence for both micro and macro-<br>
residual stresses acting at that location. In materials having high variation of micro -<br>
stress gradients, the evaluation of macro- residual stress is not proper. The elastic<br>
constant of crystal vary with their orientation so that they calculated values differ<br>
substantially from the measured values. Also, the measured values are also not<br>
always available.<br>
Ultrasonic method for evaluating residual stresses are based upon the changes in<br>
the velocity of ultrasonic waves due to stress. The disadvantages of this method is<br>
higher order elastic constants are generally required in order to relate ultrasonic<br>
velocities to residual stress. These constants which are also dependent on the<br>
metallurgical texture must be experimentally determined for a particular material<br>
being examined. This method has a limited capability for detecting sharp stress<br>
gradients and it has little use for determining residual stress in material, such as,<br>
plastics, composites and certain non-metallic<br>
Barkhausen Noise method is now-a-days a very popular method for the<br>
determination of residual stress. When a ferromagnetic material is subjected to<br>
magnetic field it becomes magnetized in a rapid series of tiny steps for jumps. These<br>
discontinuous changes can be monitored with sensitive electro-magnetic or acoustic<br>
detectors. The measured signals, called "Barkhausen Noise0 are influenced by the<br>
residual stresses in the material. Under alternating magnetic field repetitive noise<br>
patterns can be obtained. The disadvantages of this method Include a theoretical<br>
relationship between Barkhausen Noise and residual stress is yet to be established<br>
and the use is limited to ferromagnetic materials.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that the conventional processes of residual<br>
stress measurement have, certain inherent limitations and not accurate to the<br>
desired extent. Also it is not readily possible to achieve direct measurement of stress<br>
and suffer from disadvantages , such as, the x-ray diffraction method which has got<br>
limitation of depth of penetration into the material, the Barkhausen Noise method<br>
which is dependent on grain size and magnetic properties of the sample and the<br>
ultrasonic method which is highly dependent on the velocity of propagation.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a simple and accurate<br>
method of measurement of residual stress i.e. locked in stress present in a free body<br>
on which there is no external load applied.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a simple and accurate method<br>
of measurement of residual stress involving simple and effective slice (Transverse<br>
Template) cutting method which would favour avoiding limitations and draw backs<br>
associated with the presently available and practiced methods of residual stress<br>
measurement including X-ray diffraction method, Barkhausen Noise method and also<br>
the ultrasonic method.	<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a residual stress<br>
measurement method which would enable sensing / measuring the actual<br>
compression / tension caused by residual stress involving simple strain gauge which<br>
would favour direct stress measurement.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to a method for achieving bulk<br>
residual stress of samples wherein the sample is cut into small slice and in this way<br>
the total stress of the sample is released.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a simple and accurate<br>
method measurement of residual stress which would avoid the limitations of depth<br>
of penetration of materials such as experienced in conventional x-ray diffraction<br>
method .<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a method of<br>
measurement of stress wherein the Barkhausen Noise limitations which are<br>
dependent on grain size and magnetic properties of the sample could be avoided and<br>
provide for a more reliable and simple method of measurement of residual stress. <br>
A further of the present invention is directed to a method of measurement of<br>
residual stress which would not be dependent on the velocity of propagation as<br><br>
found to be a limitation of the conventional ultrasonic method of residual stress<br>
-measurement,<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic object of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method for residua] stress measurement of samples comprising:<br>
providing the sample in desired form as a test sample for the measurement;<br>
measuring the stress in the test sample using strain gauge preferably mounted or glued to<br>
the sample with switch and balance unit and a strain indicator means to obtain the stress<br>
value indicative of strain before the cutting;	<br>
transverse cutting of the test sample without any heat generation;<br>
measuring the after cut strain of the slice thus cut using strain gauge preferably<br>
mounted or glued to the sample with co-operative switch and balance unit; and<br>
identifying the residual stress using the Formula (l) σ = EΕ wherein<br>
E=2.06X 105N/mm2<br>
Ε = Measured Value in µε (micro-strain)<br>
based on the strain before the cutting and said strain after cutting.<br>
Preferably, in the above method for residual stress measurement the said slice transverse<br>
template is cut in the center of the test sample.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the test sample can comprise a rail and a sample<br>
of one meter length taken from me rail discarding two meters from the end and a slice of<br>
50-60 mm thick is cut in the center of the test sample.<br>
The strain gauges are preferably fixed with pressure sensitive adhesive and after curing<br>
connecting wires are soldered with strain gauge and terminals for subsequent installation<br>
testmg.The strain is measured using strain balancing bridge and digital strain indicator.<br>
As disclosed above, the method for residual stress measurement comprises identifying of<br>
the Residual Stresses following the formula (I) hereunder<br>
σ = Eε wherein<br>
E=2.06X 105N/mm2<br><br>
Ε = Measured Value in us (micro-strain)<br>
It is thus possible by way of above disclosed method to achieve residual stress<br>
measurement by way of a simple slice (Transverse Template) cut in the test sample.<br>
As discussed above such a test sample can be from the rail and the method would<br>
enable simple and cost effective residual stress measurement using the above<br>
method. Importantly, the slice (Transverse Template) cutting method is found to be<br>
simple and accurate and in this method actual compression / tension caused by<br>
residual stress can be sensed / measured by strain gauge. The method therefore<br>
favours direct measurement of stress.	<br>
 Also, in the method it is possible to identify bulk residual stress of the sample as the<br>
sample is cut into small slice and in this way the total stress of the sample is<br>
released.<br>
The stresses of the slice are measured before and after cutting. The strain gauges<br>
are preferably fixed with pressure sensitive adhesive. After curing, the connecting<br>
wires are soldered with strain gauges and terminals. The installation is then ready<br>
for testing and the strain is measured preferably using strain balancing bridge and<br>
digital strain indicator.<br>
The detail of the invention, its object and advantages are explained hereunder in<br>
greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplarity illustration in relation to the<br>
following accompanying figures.<br>

Figure 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the disposition of the test sample and<br>
the strain measuring units used in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the complete set up used in measuring residual stress in<br>
accordance with the invention;<br>
Figures 3A and 3B illustrate the manner of cutting of sample to provide the<br>
Transverse Template used in stress measurement;<br><br>
The sample is next disconnected and slice of the sample is cut out without<br>
Temperature rise in the sample. Such cutting of slice from the test sample is further<br>
illustrated in detail in accompanying figure in 3A and 3B.<br>
After cutting of the slice (Transverse Template) again the strain is measured with<br>
the above mentioned set up as shown in figure 2 without any disturbance. The<br>
reading of the indicator provides the strain in micro strain. The indicator means Is<br>
further shown in figure 4. Finally the residual stress is calculated based on the stress<br>
values identified before and after cutting of the test sample following the formula 1<br>
above.<br><br>
It is thus possible by way of the above invention to provide a simple and accurate<br>
method of measurement of residual stress, which would be reliable and can be<br>
readily applied. Importantly, the method is simple and accurate method of<br>
measurement of residual stress involving simple and effective slice (Transverse<br>
Template) cutting method which would favour avoiding limitations and draw backs<br>
associated with the presently available and practiced methods of residual stress<br>
measurement including X-ray diffraction method, Barkhausen Noise method and also<br>
the ultrasonic method.<br><br>
