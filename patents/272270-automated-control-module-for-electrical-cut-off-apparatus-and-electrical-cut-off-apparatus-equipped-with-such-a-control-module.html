				<td>AUTOMATED CONTROL MODULE FOR ELECTRICAL CUT-OFF<br>
APPARATUS AND ELECTRICAL CUT-OFF APPARATUS EQUIPPED<br>
WITH SUCH CONTROL MODULE<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to an automated control module for electrical cut-off<br>
apparatus, this electrical cut-off apparatus including a rotary drive shaft, this control<br>
module including a housing in which an automated actuation mechanism for the<br>
rotation of said control axis is seated, equipped with at least one translation actuator,<br>
with a device converting the translation movement of the actuator into a rotary<br>
movement and with a device transmitting the rotary movement to said drive shaft.<br>
The present invention also relates to an electrical cut-off apparatus equipped with<br>
such control module.<br>
Background art<br>
The electrical cut-off apparatuses concerned by the invention are two-position 0-1<br>
circuit-breakers, two-position I-II switches, three-position I-O-II switches, I-I+H-II<br>
overlay switches or similar devices. These electrical cut-off apparatuses usually<br>
include one or several stacked cut-off modules. The cut-off modules are of a known<br>
type and include moving contacts actuated by means of a rotary drive shaft by way of<br>
a conversion mechanism using a cam or a similar device. To carry out a "switching"<br>
function, for example in the case of a power supply switching between the mains<br>
network and an emergency power generating unit, two cut-off modules mounted in<br>
parallel and connected each to a power supply source are used, the control module<br>
being either manual or automated for large industrial circuit-breakers or switches.<br>
Automation is generally carried out using an electrical geared motor whose drive<br>
shaft is coupled via a transmission with the drive shaft of the switch-off modules,<br>
 <br>
This well-known technology has many drawbacks. Due to its high cost, it is not<br>
suitable for small-sized cut-off apparatuses. Its relatively large dimensions require<br>
oversizing the control module and this affects the volume of the whole cut-of<br>
apparatus. In addition, it requires a specific electrical power supply to feed the motor,<br>
thus switching it off in case of a power failure and making the control module<br>
inoperative. Finally, this kind of motorization has an own inertia which lengthens the<br>
switching times, and this can be detrimental to the apparatus itself. If one wishes to<br>
switch to manual mode, it is necessary to move also the geared motor or to disengage<br>
it, which imposes higher drive torques or additional mechanisms.<br>
The publication DE-C-574 857 describes another technology applied to an oil-<br>
immersed switch intended for high-voltage networks. The control mechanism of this<br>
switch includes a compressed aid jack whose piston rod forms a rack meshing with a<br>
pinion coupled to the drive shaft of the switch by means of a ratchet wheel and pawls<br>
allowing driving it only in one direction of rotation, the piston rod being also<br>
controlled by a return spring. This type of pneumatic jack actuator has the major<br>
drawback that it requires a specific and regulated compressed air supply, as well as<br>
connecting means and solenoid valve control means, which also need to be<br>
controlled. So this control mechanism is very complex, expansive and is not suitable<br>
at all for low and medium high voltage, small-sized electrical distribution.<br>
Furthermore, the efficiency of this control mechanism is mediocre, its switching<br>
quality is uncertain and its axial dimensions are very large.<br>
Presentation of the invention<br>
The present invention aims to remedy the drawbacks mentioned above by offering an<br>
automated control module which can be autonomous, i.e. without specific power<br>
supply, simple, inexpensive, compact, requiring few parts, without inertia and thus<br>
offering ultra short response times as well as a very good efficiency, ensuring an<br>
 <br>
excellent switching reliability and offering many possible switching combinations<br>
and a wide range of applications.<br>
To this purpose, the invention relates to a control module as defined in the preamble,<br>
characterized in that said actuator is provided with at least one electromagnet, in that<br>
said movement conversion device includes at least one slide coupled to said<br>
electromagnet, provided with a rack meshing with a driving pinion, this driving<br>
pinion being arranged to be coupled to said drive shaft by means of said transmission<br>
device in at least one working position when the electromagnet is powered<br>
electrically, when said control module is assembled with said electrical cut-off<br>
apparatus.<br>
The use of an electromagnet as an actuator allows reaching switching speeds lower<br>
than 50ms in order to limit the "electrical blackout".<br>
The electromagnet includes advantageously a plunger coupled to said slide and<br>
pulled back in idle position by return means when the electromagnet is not powered<br>
electrically, these return means can be located between the housing and the slide.<br>
This way, the idle position is a stable position maintained without energy.<br>
Furthermore, the electromagnet can be powered electrically directly by the cut-off<br>
apparatus it is associated with, thus ensuring its energetic autonomy.<br>
The control module includes preferentially a manual actuation mechanism located in<br>
said housing, aligned with said automated actuation mechanism, this manual<br>
actuation mechanism being provided with a gripping element which can be operated<br>
by an operator from the outside of said housing, and with a transmission device to<br>
said drive spindle.<br>
 <br>
This control module includes advantageously automatic disengagement means to<br>
disengage the manual actuation mechanism when the automated actuation<br>
mechanism is in operation, and conversely, without intervention of an operator.<br>
This objective is also reached by an electrical cut-off apparatus characterized in that<br>
it includes a control module as defined above.<br>

Best way of carrying out the invention and industrial application possibility<br>
Referring to the figures the automated control module 10 according to the invention<br>
is intended to equip electrical cut-off apparatuses 1 of a known type, such as two-<br>
position 0-1 circuit-breakers, two-position MI switches, three-position I-0-I1 switches,<br>
I-I+II-H overlay switches or similar devices. An example of a cut-off apparatus 1 is<br>
illustrated by figure 1 and includes two cut-off modules 2 stacked and associated<br>
with a control module 10. The number of cut-off modules 2 may be different and<br>
depends on the use of the cut-off apparatus 1. The cut-off modules 2 include in a<br>
known way moving contacts and anvil contacts, the moving contacts being actuated,<br>
by way of a cam system or any equivalent system, by a rotary through drive shaft (not<br>
represented). This drive shaft is designed to be rotationally coupled to the actuation<br>
mechanism of an automated and/or manual control module on one hand and, on the<br>
other hand, with another drive shaft in case of stacked cut-off modules 2. In the<br>
present invention, the drive shafts of the cut-off modules 2 are designed to be<br>
rotationally coupled to each other and to the control module 10 by means of a<br>
mechanical coupling part 3 of the Oldham® type or of a similar type, which has the<br>
advantage of being a simple coupling requiring no accurate alignment of the drive<br>
shafts.<br>
The control module 10 according to the invention includes an actuation mechanism<br>
which allows automating the actuation of the drive shaft and thus the switching of the<br>
cut-off apparatus 1 between its various states. Consequently there exist two variants<br>
of embodiment of this control module 10: a first variant of embodiment suitable for<br>
circuit-breakers or switches with two stable positions and a second variant of<br>
embodiment suitable for switches with three stable positions. In all cases, the control<br>
module 10 includes a housing 11 with a parallelepipedic general shape and designed<br>
 <br>
advantageously in a standard way in order to be common to the various variants of<br>
embodiment, the following description relating to a control module 10 for a switch<br>
with three stable positions I-O-II.<br>
This housing 11 includes two half shells assembled by fitting and by screwing them<br>
together or by a similar method, manufactured preferably by casting of electrically<br>
insulating synthetic materials. It includes on the front side a preferably translucent<br>
cover 12, mounted tilting around a hinge 13 to give access to a wrench 14 allowing to<br>
operate the control module 10, in manual mode, by inserting it in a receptacle 15 of a<br>
manual actuation mechanism 60, which will be described in detail later. This wrench<br>
14 may be replaced with any other equivalent gripping element such as an integrated<br>
or mounted handle. It also includes on the front side a window 16 allowing to<br>
visualiie the switching state of the cut-off apparatus 1:1, 0 or II, i.e. the position of<br>
the contacts, a padlocking tab 17 which allows locking the control module 10 in one<br>
switching state of the cut-off apparatus 1 or the other. Furthermore, the cover 12 is<br>
coupled with a micro-switch (not represented) actuated by a pin 18 to inhibit the<br>
operation of the control module 10 in automated mode as long as the cover 12 is<br>
open. Any other equivalent safety means may be suitable. This housing 11 also<br>
includes a terminal block 19 for the electrical connection of the power supply and of<br>
the control of the automated actuating mechanism 30 described in detail below.<br>
Referring to figures 3 to 7, the control module 10 includes a first actuation<br>
mechanism called "automated" 30, intended to be coupled directly to the drive shaft<br>
of the cut-off apparatus 1 by means of a mechanical coupling 3, followed by a second<br>
actuation mechanism called "manual" 60 arranged aligned with the first.<br>
The automated actuation mechanism 30 includes a translation actuator coupled to a<br>
device converting the translation movement of the actuator into a rotary movement<br>
that will be transmitted to the drive shaft of the cut-off apparatus 1 by a transmission<br>
device. In the represented example, the actuator includes two electromagnets 31,<br>
 <br>
arranged aligned and in opposition. Each electromagnet 31 includes in a known way<br>
an electricity-powered induction coil 32 and a plunger 33 which is mobile between<br>
an out or idle position when the induction coil 32 is not excited and an in or work<br>
position when the induction coil 32 is excited, the return movement to the out<br>
position being carried out by return means. The induction coils 32 are advantageously<br>
powered directly by the cut-off apparatus 1 by means of specific voltage taps (not<br>
represented), ensuring the energetic autonomy of the control module 10. The end of<br>
the plunger 33 of each electromagnet 31 is coupled to one and the same slide 34<br>
bearing a rack 35. This rack 34 can move in translation between three positions with<br>
respect to the housing 11: a stable central position C when the electromagnets 31 are<br>
not powered electrically, a left position G when the left electromagnet 31 is excited<br>
and a right position D when the right electromagnet 31 is excited. At least the central<br>
position C is indexed with a pin 36 (see fig. 5) provided on the side of the slide 34<br>
and cooperating with a V-shaped spring leaf (not represented) provided in the<br>
housing 11. Any other indexing means is of course possible. The means returning the<br>
plungers 33 to their out position are, in the represented example, made of a helical<br>
compression spring 37 arranged between the housing 11 and the slide 34 (see fig. 8)<br>
and they allow returning the slide 34 in its central position C when the<br>
electromagnets 31 are not powered any more. These return means can be made of any<br>
equivalent spring element arranged between the slide 34 and the housing 11, between<br>
the plungers 33 and the housing 11 or between the plungers 33 and the fixed part of<br>
the electromagnets 31. Any other arrangement of the electromagnets 31 and of the<br>
slide 34 may be suitable, knowing that the arrangement as it is illustrated allows<br>
limiting the space requirement and the dimensions of the control module 10. The<br>
control module 10 may include only one electromagnet 31 coupled to the slide 34 in<br>
the case of a cut-off apparatus 1 with only one direction of rotation.<br>
The device converting the translation movement of the actuator into a rotating<br>
movement includes the rack 35 provided on the slide 34 and meshing with a driving<br>
pinion 40. In the represented example, this driving pinion 40 includes a toothed<br>
 <br>
sector 41 which extends over an angle of approximately 270°, and a hollow body 42<br>
which extends over the remaining angle, in which two first pawls 43, arranged<br>
symmetrically with respect to a median plane passing through the axis of rotation of<br>
the driving pinion 40 and oriented in opposite directions, are mounted so that they<br>
can pivot. When the slide 34 is in its central position C, the median plane of the<br>
driving pinion 40 passes through C. These first pawls 43 are pushed against a first<br>
ratchet wheel 51 by return elements (not represented) and they are movable between<br>
a passive position in which they are away from the first ratchet wheel 51, and an<br>
active position, in which they are resting on it due to the action of the return<br>
elements. This driving pinion 40 includes a terminal section 44 provided with bosses<br>
making up first cams 45.<br>
The transmission device of the rotary movement of the driving pinion 40 to the drive<br>
shaft includes a rotary drive spindle 50 located in the housing 11 and intended to be<br>
aligned and coupled directly to the drive shaft of the cut-off apparatus 1 by means of<br>
a mechanical coupling 3 at the exit of this housing 11. This drive spindle 50 includes<br>
a first section A arranged to cooperate with the automated actuation mechanism 30<br>
and a second section M arranged to cooperate with the manual actuation mechanism<br>
60 (see fig. 3).<br>
In its first section A, the drive spindle 50 includes a cylindrical section making up the<br>
first ratchet wheel 51 intended to cooperate with the first pawls 43 of the driving<br>
pinion 40 whose function is to rotate the drive spindle 50 in one or in the other<br>
direction of rotation, according to the excited electromagnet 31, and not to rotate it<br>
when this electromagnet 31 is not excited any more and the slide 34 returns<br>
automatically in its central position C thanks to the spring 37. The first ratchet wheel<br>
51 bears two pairs of teeth 51' arranges symmetrically with respect to its median<br>
plane, identical to the median plane of the driving pinion 40 when the slide 34 is in<br>
its central position C and the cut-off apparatus is in the 0 state.<br>
 <br>
In its first section A, the drive spindle 50 includes, between the housing 11 and the<br>
first ratchet wheel 51, a coupling section 52 provided with two diametrical axial ribs<br>
52', which can penetrate in the hub 81 of a locking disk 80 to drive it in rotation. Any<br>
other rotary link form is possible. This locking disk 80, which is described in detail<br>
below, includes a terminal section 82 guided in rotation in a bore of the housing 11,<br>
is provided with a groove 82* able to receive the corresponding rib of a mechanical<br>
coupling part 3 in order to ensure a direct rotary link wit the drive shaft of the cut-off<br>
apparatus 1. Any other coupling form is naturally possible.<br>
The manual actuation mechanism 60 includes an input pinion 61 provided with the<br>
receptacle 15 accessible on the front side of the control module 10 under the cover 12<br>
to insert the wrench 14 allowing the operation. This input pinion 61 meshes with an<br>
output pinion 62 which is coaxial with the drive spindle 50 in its second section M.<br>
These input 61 and output 62 pinions make up a bevel gear pair. The output pinion<br>
62 is made up of a toothed sector of approximately 150° fastened on a sleeve 63<br>
provided inside with axial ribs 64 and outside with two bosses making up second<br>
cams 65. The output pinion 62 transmits the rotation of the input pinion 61 to the<br>
drive spindle 50 by means of a torsional spring 66 mounted coaxially on a guide<br>
section 53 of this drive spindle 50, resting axially in a receptacle 55" of a disk-<br>
shaped section 54. This torsional spring 66 belongs to a snap-action system which<br>
ensures a quick switching of the cut-off apparatus I in manual mode. It includes two<br>
legs 66a and 66b resting radially respectively against an axial rib 64 of the sleeve 63<br>
and in a receptacle 55' of a radial wall 55 extending from the disk-shaped section 54<br>
at a distance from the guide section 53. The snap-action system includes a retardation<br>
device arranged so as to allow the rotation of the drive spindle 50 only as from a<br>
predetermined compression threshold of the torsional spring 66, reached as from a<br>
predetermined stroke of the input 61 and output 62 pinions. This retardation device<br>
includes second pawls 67 mounted in order to rotate in an intermediate wall 70,<br>
which is fixed with respect to the housing 11, and a second ratchet wheel 68 linked<br>
with the drive spindle 50. This second ratchet wheel 68 is arranged between the<br>
 <br>
intermediate wall 70 and the disk-shaped section 54 of the drive spindle 50, with<br>
which it is rotationally linked by means of notches 68" fitting with blocks 56<br>
provided on the disk-shaped section 54 or similar. It can also be integrated in the<br>
drive spindle 50 to form only one part with the latter. This second ratchet wheel 68<br>
includes three teeth 68' distributed at an equal distance and which can cooperate with<br>
the second pawls 67, four in number, distributed by pairs of pawls oriented in<br>
opposite directions, symmetrically with respect to the drive spindle 50. The second<br>
pawls 67 of a same pair are pushed against the second ratchet wheel 68 by a U-<br>
shaped spring leaf 69 located in the intermediate wall 70, and they are movable<br>
between a passive position in which they are away from the second ratchet wheel 68,<br>
and an active position, in which they are resting on it due to the action of the spring<br>
leaf 69. To that purpose, each second pawl 67 has, on its free edge, cut-outs<br>
delimiting several sectors 67a-67c: the sector 67a makes up a first wing to follow the<br>
second cams 65 of the output pinion 62 causing the spreading of the second pawls 67<br>
and releasing the rotation of the drive spindle 50, the sector 67b makes up a stop for<br>
the teeth 68' of the second ratchet wheel 68 and to inhibit the rotation of the drive<br>
spindle 50 and the sector 67c makes up a second wing to follow the first cams 45 of<br>
the driving pinion 40 causing the spreading of the second pawls 67 and releasing the<br>
rotation of the drive spindle 50 during the operation of the automated actuation<br>
mechanism 30.<br>
The combination of the first cams 45 of the driving pinion 40 and of the second<br>
pawls 67 thus allows disengaging automatically the manual actuation mechanism 60<br>
when the automated actuation mechanism 30 is in operation. In this case, the drive<br>
spindle 50 can rotate freely without the torsional spring 66 being under load, since<br>
the input 61 and output 62 pinions are reversible. Conversely, when the manual<br>
actuation mechanism 60 is in operation, the automated actuation mechanism 30 is<br>
automatically disengaged by means of a retaining lip 71 provided on the intermediate<br>
wall 70, forming a stop for the first pawls 43, keeping them away from the first<br>
ratchet wheel 51. This retaining lip 71 extends on an angular sector of approximately<br>
 <br>
90° and allows the drive spindle 50 to turn freely without any action on the driving<br>
pinion 40.<br>
The control module 10 includes padlocking means to prevent the switching of the<br>
cut-off apparatus 1. These padlocking means include the locking disk 80, which is<br>
rotationally coupled to the drive spindle 50, coupled directly to the drive shaft of the<br>
cut-off apparatus 1, and provided with locking notches 83 which can receive the<br>
locking finger 84 of the padlocking tab 17 in locked position to prevent it from<br>
rotating. This padlocking tab 17 is accessible on the font side of the housing 11 under<br>
the cover 12. It is movable in translation perpendicularly to the locking disk 80<br>
between a locked position obtained by pulling manually a handle 85 to pull it out and<br>
have access to the locking hole 86 (see fig. 2 and 12B) in which the operator can<br>
insert a padlock (not represented), and an unlocked position obtained by means of a<br>
compression spring 87 which pulls the padlocking tab 17 back to its in position (see<br>
fig. 12A), or by any other equivalent spring element. The locking disk 80 includes<br>
three locking notches 83 oriented radially at an angle and passing through its<br>
peripheral wall. They are positioned in order to correspond to the three switching<br>
states of the cut-off apparatus 1:1, 0, II, so as to offer the possibility to padlock the<br>
control module 10 in one of its states. A safety ring 90 is provided inside of the<br>
locking disk 80 to inhibit the padlocking in one or in the other switching state. It<br>
includes to that purpose a peripheral wall forming a mask 91 to close one or the other<br>
locking notch 83. It is movable in rotation with respect to the locking ring 80 by<br>
means of a tool (not represented) introduced in a notch 92 accessible through a slot<br>
93 underneath the housing 11. hi figure 12A, the safety ring 90 is not operating,<br>
while, in figure 12B, it only allows padlocking in the central locking notch 83<br>
corresponding to the 0 state of the cut-off apparatus 1. The locking ring 80 can<br>
include, on its peripheral wall, in front of the window 16 on the front side of the<br>
housing 11, a marking (not represented) that allows indicating the switching state: I,<br>
0, II, of the cut-off apparatus 1 according to the angular position of this disk.<br>
 <br>
The control module 10 also includes means to drive the control of the electromagnets<br>
31. These controlling means include an indexing disk 95 mounted at the free end 57<br>
of the drive spindle 50, with which it is linked in rotation by means of a non<br>
cylindrical complementary fitting shape. This indexing disk 95 extends on an angular<br>
sector of approximately 180° and has marks such as notches 96 on the periphery,<br>
which cooperate with one or several detectors (not represented) provided in the<br>
housing 11 which send the information to an electronic board who manages the<br>
electrical power supply of the electromagnets 31. In the illustrated example, these<br>
notches 96 are three in number and correspond to the three switching states of the<br>
cut-off apparatus 1. These three switching states are also indexed mechanically by<br>
means of a V-shaped spring leaf 97 fastened on the housing 11 and which can fit in<br>
corresponding slots 98 provided in the hub 99 of the indexing disk 95. The detectors<br>
operate as limit switches, by optical detection or by other means, to switch off the<br>
power supply of the concerned electromagnet 31 as soon as the switching position to<br>
be reached is reached. Of course, any other embodiment of the indexing and of the<br>
detection of the angular position of the drive spindle 50, and thus of the switching<br>
state of the cut-off apparatus 1, can be contemplated.<br>
The operation of this control module 10 is described in detail, primarily referring to<br>
figures 8A-E who illustrate the automated actuation mechanism 30, seen from the<br>
end of the drive spindle 50, on the side of the cut-off apparatus 1. They show the two<br>
electromagnets 31, the slide 34 and its rack 35, the driving pinion 40, the first pawls<br>
43 and the first ratchet wheel 51. They also show, in dashed lines, the angular<br>
position of the drive shaft of the cut-off apparatus 1.<br>
In figure 8A, the automated actuation mechanism 30 is idle and the cut-off apparatus<br>
is in the 0 state: no electromagnet 31 is powered, the plungers 33 are in the out<br>
position, the slide 34 is in its stable central position C, its spring 37 is idle, the rack<br>
35 meshes with the motionless driving pinion 40, its median plane passing through<br>
 <br>
C, the first pawls 43 are in their passive position, lifted by the retaining lip 71, the<br>
drive spindle 50 is motionless, its median plane passing through C.<br>
In figure 8B, the automated actuation mechanism 30 is in operation, but the cut-off<br>
device 1 is still at the state 0: the electromagnet 31 located left on the figures is<br>
powered electrically, the plunger 33 starts retracting, driving the slide 34 towards the<br>
left compressing the spring 37, the rack 35 rotates the driving pinion 40 in the<br>
clockwise direction R by approximately 15°, the first pawl 43 on the right leaves the<br>
retaining lip 71 to mesh with a tooth 51' of the first ratchet wheel 51.<br>
Simultaneously, the first cams 45 of the driving pinion 40 lift the concerned second<br>
pawls 67 to release the rotation of the second ratchet wheel 68.<br>
In figure 8C, the automated actuation mechanism 30 is still in operation and the cutoff<br>
device 1 changed its state switching from state 0 to state I: the electromagnet 31<br>
located left is powered electrically, the plunger 33 is retracted, the slide 34 is on the<br>
left side G, the spring 37 is compressed, the rack 35 rotated the driving pinion 40 in<br>
the clockwise direction R by approximately 45° driving the first ratchet wheel 51<br>
thanks to the first pawl 43 on the right side 43 who meshed with one of its teeth 51',<br>
the drive spindle 50 transmits this rotation directly to the drive shaft of the cut-off<br>
device 1, which switches.<br>
In figure 8D, the automated actuation mechanism 30 is idle, but the cut-off device<br>
remained in state I: the electromagnet 31 located left is not powered any more, the<br>
spring 37 released, bringing the slide 34 back to its central position C and the<br>
plungers 33 to their idle position, the rack 35 rotated the driving pinion 40 in the<br>
opposite direction R' to bring it back to its initial position (fig. 8A), the first pawls 43<br>
spread passing over the teeth 5 T of the first ratchet wheel 51 without driving it, the<br>
drive spindle 50 did not move, remaining in its angular position corresponding to<br>
state I of figure 8C.<br>
 <br>
The automated actuation mechanism 30 is ready for a new operating cycle. It allows,<br>
powering electrically the electromagnet 31 located right, to turn the first ratchet<br>
wheel 51 in the opposite direction R1 to change the state of the cut-off apparatus and bring it back to its 0 state, then, still activating the electromagnet 31 located<br>
right, to change its state once more to switch it from state 0 to state II, as illustrated in<br>
figure 8E.<br>
The above-described operating phases are carried out in a very short time, of the<br>
order of some milliseconds, the time required for an electrical pulse. This automated<br>
actuation mechanism 30 thus allows obtaining a very fast electrical switching in the<br>
cut-off modules 2 and eliminates the need for the snap-action system. Of course, the<br>
electromagnets 31 are controlled selectively by an electronic board (not represented),<br>
which is integrated in the housing 11 and controlled by the controlling means<br>
according to the angular position of the drive spindle 50. This control module 10 thus<br>
allows, wit the help of a monostable pulse control, to control a cut-off apparatus 1<br>
having three stable positions: I-O-II or I-I+H-II, or more. It also allows controlling a<br>
cut-off apparatus 1 having two stable positions: 1-0 or I-IL The same result can be<br>
obtained using a control module 10 equipped with one single electromagnet 31. In<br>
this case, the first ratchet wheel 51 is provided with teeth 5T distributed regularly all<br>
along its periphery to cooperate with one single first pawl 43, so as; to rotate the drive<br>
spindle 50 in the same direction of rotation.<br>
The operation of this control module 10 will now be described in detail referring to<br>
figures UA-C, which illustrate the manual actuation mechanism 60. They show the<br>
second ratchet wheel 68, the second pawls 67, their spring leaf 69, the sleeve 63 and<br>
the second cams 65 of the output pinion 62 and, in dashed lines, the drive spindle 50.<br>
They do not show the input pinion 61, neither the wrench 14 used to rotate it. The<br>
operation is also described referring to the figures 10A-C, which illustrate the<br>
torsional spring 66 of the snap-action system. These figures show, by transparency.<br>
 <br>
the sleeve 63 and its internal axial ribs 64, the torsional spring 66 and its legs 66a,<br>
66b, the drive spindle 50, its disk-shaped section 54 and its radial wall 55.<br>
When the automated actuation mechanism 30 is not in operation, i.e. when the<br>
control module 10 is in manual mode, the first pawls 43 are in passive position, being<br>
held away from the first ratchet wheel 51 by the retaining lip 71 of the intermediate<br>
wall 70. In this case, the drive spindle 50 can rotate freely without actuating the<br>
driving pinion 40 or the rack 35.<br>
In figures 10A and 11 A, the manual actuation mechanism 60 is idle and the cut-off<br>
apparatus is in the 0 state: the output pinion 62 is in its central position, the second<br>
pawls 67 rest against the sleeve 63 due to the action of their spring leaf 69, the<br>
second pawls 67 of the left side being meshed with two teeth 68' of the second<br>
ratchet wheel 68, blocking its rotation in both directions, the torsional spring 66 is<br>
idle, the drive spindle 50 is motionless.<br>
In figure 10B, the manual actuation mechanism 60 is in operation and the cut-off<br>
device 1 is still at the state 0: the output pinion 62 rotated towards left in the counter-<br>
clockwise direction R' by an angle of approximately 60° due to the manual action of<br>
an operator on the wrench 14 to rotate the input pinion 61 by a corresponding angle,<br>
the second ratchet wheel 68 remains immobilized by the seconds pawls 67 who mesh<br>
with its teeth 68', the torsional spring 66 is compressed, its leg 66a being moved by<br>
the axial rib 64 of the sleeve 63, the other leg 66b remaining blocked in the<br>
receptacle 55' of the radial wall 55 of the drive spindle 50, which remains<br>
motionless.<br>
In figure 11B, the manual actuation mechanism 60 is in operation and the cut-off<br>
device 1 changed its state, passing from state 0 to state II: the second cams 65 of the<br>
output pinion 62 lifted the second pawls 67, which released the ratchet wheel 68,<br>
authorizing the rotation of the drive spindle 50 in the same direction R' under the<br>
 <br>
action of the torsional spring 66. This sudden rotational movement is transmitted<br>
directly to the drive shaft of the cut-off device 1, which switches quickly. The second<br>
pawls 67 on the right side are now meshed with the teeth 68' of the second ratchet<br>
wheel 68, blocking its rotation in both directions, to allow switching the cut-off<br>
apparatus from state II to state 0 by rotating the output pinion 62 in the opposite<br>
direction R using the wrench 14 and the input pinion 61. In this case, the torsional<br>
spring 66 will again be compressed to obtain a quick switching. These steps are not<br>
illustrated.<br>
In figure IOC, the manual actuation mechanism 60 is in operation and the cut-off<br>
device 1 is in state 0: the output pinion 62 rotated to the right in the clockwise<br>
direction R by an angle of approximately 60° due to the manual action of an operator<br>
on the wrench 14 to rotate the input pinion 61 by a corresponding angle, the second<br>
ratche.t wheel 68 remains immobilized by the second pawls 67 which mesh with the<br>
teeth 68', the torsional spring 66 is compressed, its leg 66b being moved by the axial<br>
rib 64 of the sleeve 63, the other leg 66a remaining blocked in the receptacle 55' of<br>
the radial wall 55 of the drive spindle 50, which remains motionless.<br>
In figure 11C, the manual actuation mechanism 60 is in operation and the cut-off<br>
device 1 changed its state and passed from state 0 to state I: the second cams 65 of<br>
the output pinion 62 lifted the second pawls 67, which released the ratchet wheel 68<br>
authorizing the rotation of the drive spindle 50 in the same direction R under the<br>
action of the torsional spring 66. This sudden rotational movement is transmitted<br>
directly to the drive shaft of the cut-off device 1, which switches quickly. The second<br>
pawls 67 on the right side are again meshed with the teeth 68' of the second ratchet<br>
wheel 68, blocking its rotation in both directions, to allow switching the cut-off<br>
apparatus from state I to state 0 by rotating the output pinion 62 in the opposite<br>
direction R' using the wrench 14 and the input pinion 61. In this case, the torsional<br>
spring 66 is again compressed to obtain a quick switching. These steps are not<br>
illustrated.<br>
 <br>
In the case of a cut-off apparatus 1 with only one direction of rotation, since the<br>
control module 10 includes only one electromagnet 31, the manual 60 and automated<br>
30 actuation mechanisms are naturally adapted, e.g. the number and angular position<br>
of the teeth 68' of the second ratchet wheel 68 being adapted to the switching angles.<br>
The present invention also relates to the cut-off apparatus 1 as such equipped with a<br>
control module 10.<br>
This description shows clearly that the invention allows reaching all the objectives<br>
defined. In particular, this control module is designed in a very simple way, compact,<br>
with a limited number of parts and with parts that are common to the embodiment<br>
variants intended as well for bistable as for tristable cut-off apparatuses, thus at very<br>
inexpensive costs. This control module can be adapted on any type of cut-off<br>
apparatus 1 equipped with a drive shaft, and it can retrofit already existing<br>
apparatuses or be mounted on new apparatuses in the factory. This control module<br>
allows reaching very high switching speeds using a simple electrical pulse. It also<br>
allows the operation in manual mode without requiring to disengage the automatic<br>
mode, which allows for example to switch on automatically and to switch off<br>
manually, or vice-versa. This control module also allows a remote control, and it can<br>
be associated with any monitoring, failure detection, protection equipment.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the embodiment example described, but it<br>
extends to any modification and variant evident for a person skilled in the art, while<br>
still remaining within the scope of the protection conferred by the attached claims, as<br>
well as to any application and combination possible for this person skilled in the art.<br>
