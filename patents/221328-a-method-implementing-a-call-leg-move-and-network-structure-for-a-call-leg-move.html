				<td>Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention relates generally to a call moving technology in a telecommunication system, and more particularly to a method and network structure for moving a call leg.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a telecommunication system, based on actual requirement, there is a multiparty call mode; in this mode a call has three or more than three call parties and each party is called a call leg. A call leg communicates with other call legs that belong to the same call. During communication, based on requirement a call leg may need to move from one call to another and then communicates with call legs of said another call.<br>
In the present technologies, an application server encapsulates and makes abstract of the underlying telecommunication network capabilities to provide a simple and open service capacity interface to applications, and the application services are created through the open service capacity interface. For the multiparty call situation mentioned above, the present technology, such as Parlay/OSA API, provides only a creating leg and releasing leg methods that cannot move a leg from one call to another directly. With this technology, when a leg of one call wants to move to another call, the only way to do is first to release from the original call to terminate the connection with the original call, and then create the leg in the destination call to connect with the destination call. Although in this way, a call leg can be moved from one call to another, but for the user using this leg to communicate, the call leg must create a new connection with destination call after releasing form the original call, not only this way is complex, but also during the call is moved the user communication is interrupted so as to interfere the continuity of communication, and data and states in the original call are changed so as to lose some important information; this is a disadvantage for some services that need communication continuity such as charging service.<br><br>
Obviously, the present technology cannot implement a call-leg-moving from one call to another without terminating the communication of this leg.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides a method and a network structure that can move a call leg between calls without terminating the communication of this leg.<br>
The invention provides a method to implement the above objective comprises the following steps:<br>
A.	creating a call-leg-moving interface and its  method interface reference<br>
parameters, which are used to move a call leg from an original call to a destination<br>
call, wherein the said interface reference parameters are: a identifier of a call leg to be<br>
moved and a destination call identifier;<br>
B.	if application wants to move the said call leg to be moved,  determining the<br>
interface reference parameters according to said call leg and destination call, invoking<br>
said call-leg-moving interface to move said call leg from said original call to said<br>
destination call with said interface reference parameters .<br>
Wherein, said moving a call leg to destination call comprising:<br>
Bl. an application notifying said original call that said call leg being moved to a destination call;<br>
B2. said original call breaking resource occupied by said call leg, changing original call identifier to destination call identifier through setting the call message of the said call leg, and sending a call leg move request to said destination call;<br>
B3. having received call leg move request sent from said original call, said destination call determining whether its resource is enough, if it is enough, said destination call allocating resource to said leg and said call leg move is successful, otherwise it is failure.<br>
after Step B3, the method further comprising: said destination call notifying said Application about call leg move result.<br>
Step B further comprising: notifying a user terminal corresponding to said call leg to be moved that said call leg is moving to said destination call.<br>
The said changing original call identifier to destination call identifier through setting the call message of the said call leg in Step B2 further comprising: at least media type, charging policy and terminal information in call message are kept unchanged.<br>
Wherein, said original call and destination call are a multiparty call, respectively.<br>
Said moving call leg in Step B further comprising: keeping said call leg in a suspending state in said original call.<br>
For implementing objective mentioned above, the invention also provides A network structure for a call leg move that comprises a telecommunication network, a capability-abstracting layer and an application layer; said capability-abstracting layer abstracts capabilities of the telecommunication network into independent functions, and each independent function provides a corresponding interface to said application layer; through invoking interfaces, said application layer can provide services that implemented by the independent functions;<br>
The said capability-abstracting layer further comprises a call-leg-moving function, and a call-leg-moving interface provided to said application layer with at least two parameters: a identifier of a call leg to be moved and a destination call identifier.<br>
Wherein, said call-leg-moving interface is a newly added interface to Parlay/OSA API with at least two parameters: a identifier of a call leg to be moved and a destination identifier.<br>
Wherein, said call-leg-moving interface is a newly added open interface with at least two parameters: a identifier of a call leg to be moved and a destination call identifier.<br>
Wherein, said call-leg-moving interface further includes one 'out' parameter for showing a result of call-leg-moving: true or false.<br>
The invention provides a call-leg-moving interface to the application layer, and when an application wants to move a call leg, it simply invokes the call-leg-moving interface to implement the call-leg-moving. During a call leg is moved to another call, the communication of this leg is not terminated for the reason of the call-leg-moving, thereby providing the continuous communication service, and the data and states in the original call be kept, so communication continuity in the original call can be kept; this is benefit for service with continuity requirement, such as continuously charging etc.<br>
The invention provides a simple, convenient, easy to implement and spread service for call leg move from one call to another.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiment<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and<br>
complete, and will folly convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
The invention provides an open interface for call-lcg-moving to applications; through the open interface an application implements some services with relational tunction including call-leg-moving service such as call hold and call moving etc.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a network structure of a telecommunication network; there are three layers: an upper layer, an intermediate layer and a lower layer. The upper layer is an application layer; the intermediate layer is a capability-abstracting layer; the lower layer is a telecommunication network layer. The capability-abstracting layer makes capability abstract of the lower telecommunication layer and encapsulates the capabilities into independent functions, such as call, control, messaging, moving management etc.; each independent function corresponds to an interface provided to the applications. Through invoking the interfaces an application uses the capacities of a telecommunication network in order to implement telecommunication service, each independent function includes some small functions. In this invention, a call-leg-moving function is newly added in capability-abstracting layer, and the call-leg-moving interface corresponding to the call-leg-moving function and its parameters are added, the call-leg-moving interface is used to provide newly added call-leg-moving function to application layer; the parameters of the call-leg-moving interface at least include the interlace reference parameters which are: the call leg identifier to be moved and the destinalion call identifier to be moved to, and the interface reference parameters further include one output parameter for showing the moving result. Referring to Fig. 1, in this embodiment the call-leg-moving function is one part of the whole call control function.<br>
In this embodiment, a call-leg-moving interface is implemented by defining a new IrpMultiPartyCall open interface. The IrpMultiPartyCall interface has one movelegmethod with two parameters: destCall: in IpMultiPartyCall and legID: TpCallLegldentifier. the call-leg-moving function is implemented by this IrpMultiParlyCall interface; wherein, the destCall: in IpMultiPartyCall, which is the interface reference of the destination call that the call leg will be moved to, is the identifier of the destination call; and the legID: TpCallLegldentifier, which is the identifier of the call leg to be moved, includes a ID and a interface reference of the<br>
call leg. The IrpMultiPartyCall interface further has output parameter which is a Boolean value in this embodiment, after the IrpMultiPartyCall interface invoked, this output parameter is used for showing the result of call leg move: when it is a true value, it shows that the call leg move is successful; when it is a false value, it shows that the call leg move is failure.<br>
In other embodiments of the invention, the call-leg-rnoving function can be added to an existing interface that will be implemented as follow:<br>
In the Parlay API multiparty call, the call-leg-moving function is added to the IpMultiPartyCall interface in order to implement making a call leg move form one call to another, IpMultiPartyCall interface includes moveleg method with parameters: destCall: in IpMultiParlyCall and legID: in TpCallLegldentifier; wherein the destCall: in IpMultiPartyCall. which is the interface reference of the destination call that the call leg will be moved to, is used as identifier of the destination call; and the legID: TpCnllLegldentificr. which is the identifier of the call leg to be moved, includes a ID and a interface reference of the call leg. Also, the IpMultiPartyCall interface further has a output parameter which is Boolean value in this embodiment, after the IrpMultiPartyCall interface invoked, this output parameter is used for showing the result of call leg move: when it is a true value, it shows that the call leg move is successful; when it is a false value, it shows that the call leg move is failure.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that the method of the embodiment of the present invention includes the following steps:<br>
Step 20 1. Create a call-leg-moving interface and its parameters for moving a call leg from the original call to a destination call; said parameters at least include the interlace reference parameters which are the call leg identifier to be moved and the destination call identifier to be moved to; the said parameters further include output parameter which is used to the result of the call -leg move.<br>
Step 202. When an application wants to move a call leg, the interface reference parameters are decided according to the call leg to be moved and the destination call that the call leg will be moved to, and the application invokes the call-leg-moving interface with the interface reference parameters; and then the connection between the call leg and the original call is broken by the call-leg-moving interface and the voice<br>
channel resource occupied by the call leg in the original call is released; later a voice channel resource in the destination call is allocated to the call leg and the call leg is moved to the destination call; finally a result of the call -leg move is returned to the application.<br>
Fig. 3 shows that the call-leg-moving interface implements the call leg move method with the following steps:<br>
Step 301, the application notifies the original call that a call leg will be moved to the destination call;<br>
Step 302, the original call breaks the voice channel resource occupied by the call leg; the original call identifier in the call message is changed to the destination call identifier, and then a call leg move request is sent to the destination call; wherein the call messages at least include: the call identifier, the media type, the charging policy and the terminal information; changing the belonging of the leg is implemented by changing the call identifier of the call messages, in this embodiment the media type, the charging policy and the terminal information are kept unchanged;<br>
Step 303, having received the call leg move request from the original call, the destination call determines whether there is enough voice channel resource to allocate a voice channel to the call leg, if it is, a voice channel is allocated to the call leg and the call-leg-moying is successful, otherwise the call-leg-moving is failure;<br>
Step 304, based on the result of Step 303, the destination call will notify the result to the original call, and then the original call will notify to the application.<br>
It can be seen from the mention above that the call-leg-moving method is as follow: break the voice channel resource occupied by the call leg in the original call, change messages related to the original call to messages related to the destination call, then allocate voice channel resource in the destination call to the call leg. which makes that the call leg can communicate with other call legs in the destination call. In this embodiment, during the call leg is moved the call leg state and data in the original call are kept unchanged, and the call leg is in a suspended state in the original call so as to hold this call leg in original call. Obviously, at Step 302, it is informed to the user terminal corresponding to the call leg that the call leg will be moved to the<br>
destination call in order that the user terminal can understand its call environment in time.<br>
It should be emphasized that two pre-conditions must be satisfied to implement the call-leg-moving function: first, the call leg must break connection of the resource having been allocated by the original call; secondly, the destination call has been created before the call leg moves to it.<br>
In Fig. 4, a multiparty chat service on a Web page is used to describe an application detail of the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A Web multiparty chat service provides a Web page through which multiparty calls can be created and all current calls and the call parties in each call can be seen and managed.<br>
Fig. 4 shows two calls with identifiers 28800001 and 28800002, respectively. The call 28800001 has continued 10 minutes and 20 seconds with four users: the user 1, 2, 3 and 4; each of them is one call party i.e. one call leg of the call. The call 28800002 has continued 5 minutes with three users: the user 5, 6 and 7.<br>
As shown on the left side of the Fig. 4, in call 28800001 before a call leg is moved out, the user 1 with identifier 2870001 has communicated 9 minutes and is at the connection state, the user 2 with identifier 2870002 has communicated 2 minutes and is at the connection state, the user 3 with identifier 2870003 has communicated 3 minutes and is at the connection state, and the user 4 with identifier 2870004 has communicated 5 minutes and is at the connection state; in the call 28800002 before a call leg is moved in. the user 5 with identifier 2870004 has communicated 5 minutes and is at the connection state, the user 6 with identifier 2870002 has communicated 2 minutes and is at the connection state, and the user 7 with identifier 2870002 has communicated 5 minutes and is at the connection state.<br>
During call, when user 2 or other authenticated persons drag the user 2 call leg from the call 28800001 to the call 28800002, it is equivalent that user 2 or other authenticated persons send out a call leg move request; and then the application will invoke the call-leg-moving interface to perform the call-leg-moving.<br>
As shown in the right side of the Fig. 4, after the call leg has been moved, the user 2 in the call 28800001 is at a hold state and its call leg is suspended, so it cannot communicate with other three users in the call, but its call messages are kept unchanged in the call 28800001; the user 2 is connected to the call 28800002 and can communicate with the user 5, 6 or 7.<br>
Naturally, when the user 2 has finished the communication in the call 28800002, it can be returned to the call 28800001 and communicates with users 1, 3 or 4 continuously, since its call messages, such as the media type and the charging information, are kept unchanged during departure.<br>
Besides, when the call leg of the user 2 in the call 28800001 is at a suspended state, it can be released at any time; this means that the user 2 is disconnected with the call. Later, if the user 2 wants to join the call 28800001 again, user 2 should create the connection again.<br>
Fig. 5 is a sequence diagram of a call leg move service based on the Fig. 3 call-leg-moving operation.<br>
Steps 501 - 504, user A invokes service application on a Web page and initiates a multiparty call request; the application creates a multiparty call with the call identifier MPCC Calll, and then according to the calling number set by user A, the MPCC Calll creates a call leg with the identifier callLegl for user A.<br>
Steps 505 - 508, user B invokes service application on a Web page and initiates another multiparty call request on a Web page; the application creates a multiparty call with the call identifier MPCC Call2, and then according to the calling number set by user B, the MPCC Call2 creates a call leg with the identifier callLeg2 for user B.<br>
Steps 509 - 510, during the call is in progress, user A drags the callLegl from MPCC Calll to MPCC Call2 on the Web page, and then the Application notifies MPCC' Calll that callLegl need to be moved to MPCC Call2.<br>
Steps 511 - 512, after having received the move leg notification, MPCC Calll obtains the call leg to be moved according to the legID: in TpCallLegldentifier and<br>
notifies user of callLegl that the call leg will be moved from MPCC Calll to MPCC Call2; and then MPCC Calll breaks the resource of callLegl allocated by MPCC Calll; from now on callLegl is suspended and cannot communicate with other parties<br>
of MPCC Calll.<br>
Step 513, MPCC Calll notifies callLegl to update its call message; those messages related to MPCC Calll are changed to messages related to MPCC Call2, such as call identifier and the media resource channel etc.; other messages, such as media type, charging policy and terminal information etc, are kept unchanged.<br>
Step 514, MPCC Calll obtains the destination call MPCC Call2 that the call leg callLegl will be moved to according to the destCall: in IpMultiPartyCall, and then MPCC Calll notifies MPCC Call2 the callLegl to be joined to MPCC Call2and transfers the eall leg identifier to MPCC Call2.<br>
Steps 515 516, alter having received the move leg request from MPCC Calll, MPCC Call2 allocates resource to callLegl and will report the allocation result: true or false to MPCC Calll; if the resource allocation is successful, callLegl can communicate with other legs in MPCC Call2; naturally, whether the resource allocation is successful depends on whether there are enough resources in MPCC Call2 and whether MPCC Call2 accepts the callLegl.<br>
Step 517. after having received the result from MPCC Call2, MPCC Calll determines whether the call leg move is successful; if it is successful, MPCC Calll will return a true value to the Application, otherwise a false value.<br>
Said resource in the above description, Steps  1  to  17, is the voice channel<br>
resource.<br>
