				<td>Actuator arrangement having selector drums for a twin-clutch transmission<br>
The present invention relates to an actuator arrangement for a twin-clutch transmis-<br>
sion which has a first and a second partial transmission, with the first partial trans-<br>
mission containing odd forward gear stages and with the second partial transmission<br>
containing even forward gear stages, having at least one first and one second selector<br>
drum which have in each case one controllable drive motor and at least one control<br>
cam, with each control cam being assigned at least one cam follower, with it being<br>
possible for the cam followers to be connected in each case to a selector sleeve of an<br>
associated shift clutch pack in order to engage and disengage gear stages of the twin-<br>
clutch transmission.<br><br>
2<br>
Prior art:<br>
- Selector drums which, in a shift transmission, axially move a sliding block, a<br>
roller or a similar cam follower, and thereby a shift fork which is connected to<br>
the cam follower, by means of a control cam or curved track (selector drum<br>
groove) or a bead, in order to engage or disengage a gear by means of a shift<br>
clutch.<br>
- Selector drum systems having one or more selector drums.<br>
Motorcycle transmission having selector drum actuation.<br>
Principle structure and function of a twin-clutch transmission (DKG) or<br>
powershift transmission having two clutches and two partial transmissions<br>
connected thereto, with it being possible for transmission stages and therefore<br>
individual gears or gear stages of the twin-clutch transmission to be realized<br>
by means of fixed wheels and loose wheels which can be connected in a rota-<br>
tionally form-fitting manner by means of shift clutches.<br>
- Selector drum systems having two selector drums and one wheel set arrange-<br>
ment, in which the even gears are served by the one roller and the odd gears<br>
are served by the other roller (DE 198 40 621 C2; DE 199 20 440 C2).<br>
- Selector drums having an encircling groove (DE 199 24 335 Al).<br>
- Use of at least two selector drums for a twin-dutch transmission (EP 1 182<br>
376 A2; DE 101 28 854 Al).<br>
- Prior art pursuant to § 3(2) PatG: DE 103 61 356.0: selector drum having a<br>
movable groove flank.<br>
- Use of a selector drum for a twin-clutch transmission (DE 101 28 854 Al, EP<br>
0 831 256 Bl; DE 30 37 990 Al).<br>
- Selector drum systems which allow gears to be skipped (primarily during<br>
downshifts) or the engagement of two gears simultaneously by means of axi-<br>
ally moveable selector drums, adjusting members, force-loaded switch points<br>
or controlled switch points or corresponding groove sections (DE 101 28 854<br>
Al, DE 196 38 269 Al, EP 0 831 256 Bl, DE 199 24 335 Al, DE 195 09 477<br>
Al, DE 195 43 645 Al).<br><br>
3<br>
Disadvantages of the prior art<br>
1. Skipping gears in multiple shifts (for example 6→3, 5→2 etc.) is a problem in<br>
particular in a twin-clutch transmission. When using a selector drum actuat-<br>
ing arrangement having a selector drum, and in particular also when using a<br>
selector drum actuating arrangement having two selector drums with the<br>
separation of the even gears being situated on one selector drum and the odd<br>
gears being situated on the other roller, multiple shifts of said type are gener-<br>
ally possible only if intermediate gears are "passed through", that is to say are<br>
also engaged and disengaged. "Passing through" the gears is necessary in order<br>
to be able to carry out subsequent single upshifts, with possible tractive force<br>
bridging, according to an expedient shift sequence logic.<br>
Example:<br>
Selector drum 01 (SCHW_01): R-l-3-5	Partial transmission 1<br>
Selector drum 02 (SCHW_02): 2-4-6	Partial transmission 2<br>
Here, if a tractive downshift 5-2 is to be directly carried out, specifically with<br>
tractive force bridging, that is to say without an interruption in tractive force,<br>
the following takes place: before the actual "gearshift" can take place by merg-<br>
ing (crossfading) between the clutches, that is to say by means of a transfer of<br>
torque from the partial transmission 1 to the partial transmission 2, on<br>
SCHW_02, which according to the selector drum logic is in the 4th gear or in<br>
neutral between the 4th and 6th gears or in 6th gear, initially the 6th gear is to be<br>
disengaged and the 4th gear is to be engaged and disengaged or only the 4th<br>
gear is to be disengaged, and then the 2nd gear is to be subsequently engaged.<br>
Only then can the torque transfer take place. Finally, SCHW_01 must then<br>
disengage the 5th gear or even additionally engage and possibly again disen-<br>
gage the 3rd gear in order to be able to subsequently directly carry out a possi-<br>
ble 2-1 or 2-3 shift with tractive force bridging. SCHW_01 must accordingly be<br><br>
4<br>
"tracked" (must follow).<br>
2.	In the prior art, therefore, the gears cannot be directly freely selected in<br>
relation to one another, and it is therefore not possible for every driver de-<br>
mand, or every driving situation, to be optimally fulfilled or covered.<br>
A lack of direct selection freedom in the event, for example, of multiple<br>
downshifts entails a considerable degree of additional expenditure in terms of<br>
time. The acceleration capability of a vehicle demanded for example by a 5-2<br>
or 6-3 shift is therefore slowed, since, as described, gears must additionally be<br>
engaged or disengaged and only a purely sequential shift sequence is possible,<br>
respectively.<br>
3.	In terms of functionality, the selector drum actuating arrangement is therefore<br>
considerably more disadvantageous than other shift actuating arrangements,<br>
in particular than a hydraulic shift actuating arrangement with individual<br>
rods, that is to say a shift unit having one actuator per gear pair or selector<br>
sleeve.<br>
4.	Passing through the gears, or the tracking of the gears, likewise leads to an<br>
additional loading of the synchronizing units and thereby to a reduction of<br>
service life.<br>
5.	Only by considerably increasing the structural expenditure or increasing the<br>
installation space demand and costs is it possible, with a selector drum actuat-<br>
ing arrangement having two selector drums according to the prior art, to carry<br>
out only some of the possible, relevant direct multiple shifts as stated above.<br>
It is accordingly the object of the invention to specify an improved actuator ar-<br>
rangement and a twin-clutch transmission equipped with said actuator arrangement.<br><br>
5<br>
Said object is achieved in the actuator arrangement specified in the introduction in<br>
that<br>
- the control cam of at least one selector drum encircles through at least 360°,<br>
- the associated drive motor is designed to drive said selector drum through at<br>
least 360°, and<br>
- the gear stages are distributed on the two selector drums, and arranged on the<br>
control cams, in such a way that at least one direct multiple shift can be car-<br>
ried out.<br>
The object is also achieved by means of a twin-clutch transmission having an actua-<br>
tor arrangement of said type.<br>
Preferred embodiments are specified in the subclaims.<br>
The invention is realized in a shift actuating arrangement, preferably having two<br>
selector drums, in connection with a gear arrangement / gear pairing which is<br>
adapted specifically to the shift system, preferably in a 6+R-gear transmission, that is<br>
to say in a transmission having 7 engageable gears.<br>
This leads to a cost-effective selector drum actuating arrangement, which is neutral in<br>
installation space terms, having two selector drums, in particular for a 6+R-gear twin-<br>
clutch transmission, which permits the degree of selection freedom which is suffi-<br>
cient for a twin-clutch transmission for a direct gear selection.<br>
In a twin-clutch transmission according to the invention, the essential multiple<br>
downshifts or multiple upshifts with possible tractive force bridging or intermediate<br>
support can therefore be realized directly, in particular without additional engage-<br>
ment and disengagement processes of gears in the transmission.<br><br>
6<br>
Particularly important shifts include the multiple downshifts 6-3; 5-2; 6-5-2; 6-3-2<br>
and the multiple upshifts 3-6; 2-5; 2-5-6; 2-3-6 (in contrast, the shifts 4-1 and 1-4 are<br>
usually less expedient on account of speed limitations of the engine).<br>
The shift actuating arrangement according to the invention is capable, after said<br>
multiple shifts, of carrying out all subsequently possible single upshifts and single<br>
downshifts with possible tractive force bridging. The shift sequence logic is therefore<br>
always maintained. Gears need not be tracked.<br>
This results overall in a considerable increase in functionality with a minimal in-<br>
crease in costs.<br>
The implementation of the invention for a front-transverse twin-dutch transmission<br>
is particularly preferable.<br>
Provision is preferably made of a (for example spring-load-controlled) switch point<br>
for the shift function of the reverse gear. This makes it possible to realize a particu-<br>
larly preferred embodiment in which the 1st gear and the reverse gear are divided<br>
between the two partial transmissions.<br>
The switch point can also be actively controlled by means of the 1st gear, that is to<br>
say for example by means of the other selector drum.<br>
The selector drums can in each case be formed as classic selector drums, as cam disks,<br>
from wound metal sheet etc., specifically with corresponding control cams in the<br>
form of a control groove, control bead or other control contour, etc.<br>
The cam follower can be embodied as a sliding block, as a roller, as a pin etc.<br>
The selector drum can be produced using all known production methods, for exam-<br>
ple can be of massive or constructed (multi-part) design.<br><br>
7<br>
The actuator arrangement can be realized, without a restriction in functionality, for a<br>
transmission with 6 or fewer gears. Said actuator arrangement can also be realized,<br>
without a restriction in functionality, for a transmission with 8 or more gears.<br>
It is self-evident that the features specified above and the features yet to be explained<br>
below can be used not only in the respectively specified combination but also in<br>
other combinations or individually without departing from the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>

Figure 13 shows the schematic sequence of a shift N→R with the modified<br>
embodiment of the actuator arrangement of figure 9.<br>
In figure 1, a first embodiment of a twin-clutch transmission according to the inven-<br>
tion is denoted generally by 10.<br>
The twin-clutch transmission 10 has a first drive input shaft 12 and a second drive<br>
input shaft 14. The second drive input shaft 14 is embodied as a hollow shaft and is<br>
arranged concentrically with respect to the first drive input shaft 12.<br><br>
9<br>
The first drive input shaft 12 can be connected to a first dutch Kl. The second drive<br>
input shaft 14 can be connected to a second clutch K2.<br>
The first drive input shaft 12 extends over a greater axial extent than the second<br>
drive input shaft and projects beyond the latter.<br>
The twin-clutch transmission 10 also has a first drive output shaft 16 and a second<br>
drive output shaft 18. The two drive output shafts 16, 18 are arranged in each case<br>
parallel to the drive input shafts 12, 14 and are connected, by means of a drive<br>
output constant gear set, to a differential drive input wheel 24 of a differential<br>
gearing 26.<br>
More precisely, the drive output constant gear set has a first drive output wheel 20<br>
which is rotationally fixedly connected to the first drive output shaft 16, and has a<br>
second drive output wheel 22 which is rotationally fixedly connected to the second<br>
drive output shaft 18.<br>
The two drive output wheels 20, 22 are aligned with one another axially and both<br>
engage with the differential drive input wheel 24.<br>
The twin-clutch transmission 10 has six forward gear stages 1-6 and one reverse gear<br>
R. The odd forward gear stages 1, 3, 5 are assigned to a first partial transmission of<br>
the twin-clutch transmission 10 and therefore to the first clutch Kl.<br>
The even forward gear stages 2, 4, 6 and the reverse gear stage R are assigned to a<br>
second partial transmission of the twin-clutch transmission 10 and therefore to the<br>
second clutch K2.<br>
The forward gear stages 1, 2 and 6 are assigned to the first drive output shaft 16. The<br>
forward gear stages 3, 4 and 5 and the reverse gear stage R are assigned to the second<br>
drive output shaft 18.<br><br>
10<br>
A shift clutch pack SKI having one shift clutch is mounted on the first drive output<br>
shaft 16 and is assigned to the forward gear stage 1. A shift clutch pack SK2/6 having<br>
two shift clutches is assigned to the forward gears 2, 6. Correspondingly, a shift<br>
clutch pack SK3/5 having two shift clutches is assigned to the forward gear stages 3, 5<br>
and a shift clutch pack SK4/R is assigned to the gear stages 4, R.<br>
The shift dutches realized in the shift clutch packs SK are for example embodied as<br>
conventional synchronous clutches.<br>
Arranged on the first drive output shaft 16, in this sequence proceeding from the<br>
transmission input, are: a first drive output wheel 20, a loose wheel for the forward<br>
gear stage 2, a rotational direction reversal wheel 28 for the reverse gear stage R, the<br>
shift clutch pack SK2/6, a loose wheel for the forward gear stage 6, the shift clutch<br>
pack SKI, and a loose wheel for the forward gear stage 1.<br>
Correspondingly arranged on the second drive output shaft 18, in this sequence<br>
proceeding from the transmission input, are: a second drive output wheel 22, a<br>
parking lock 30, a loose wheel of the reverse gear stage R, the shift clutch pack SK4/R,<br>
a loose wheel for the forward gear stage 4, a loose wheel for the forward gear stage 5,<br>
the shift clutch pack SK3/5, and a loose wheel for the forward gear stage 3.<br>
The rotational direction reversal wheel 28 and the loose wheel for the forward gear<br>
stage 2 are rotationally fixedly connected to one another. The rotational direction<br>
reversal wheel 28 is aligned axially with the loose wheel of the reverse gear stage R on<br>
the second drive output shaft 18. Correspondingly, the parking lock 30 is aligned<br>
axially with the loose wheel for the second forward gear stage 2 on the first drive<br>
output shaft 16.<br>
In addition, the forward gear stages 4, 6 are aligned axially with one another and<br>
mesh with a common fixed wheel 32. In other words, a so-called dual use of the<br>
forward gear stages 4, 6 is realized.<br><br>
11<br>
In the transmission 10, the forward gear stage 1 and the reverse gear stage R are<br>
situated on different partial transmissions and are therefore assigned to different<br>
clutches Kl and K2.<br>
The reverse gear stage R is driven by means of the rotational direction reversal wheel<br>
28 of the forward gear stage 2, that is to say so to speak by means of the stepped<br>
second gear. Here, it is possible to realize a transmission ratio similar to that of the<br>
first gear.<br>
The parking lock 30 is attached opposite the loose wheel or shift wheel of the for-<br>
ward gear stage 2.<br>
A dual use is realized. The forward gear stages 1, 2 are situated on one drive output<br>
shaft, the output drive shaft 16. In total, four synchronous clutch packs SK are<br>
provided.<br>
The forward gear stage 1 is situated on the drive output shaft 16 with a short axial<br>
spacing. The gear stages with a large shift wheel or large loose wheel diameter (in the<br>
present case, the gear stages 1 and 2 on the drive output shaft 16 and the gear stages<br>
3 and R on the drive output shaft 18) are arranged axially at the outside, so that an<br>
actuating arrangement having two selector drums SWlc, SW2c, as described below,<br>
can be arranged in between, radially close to the drive output shafts 16, 18.<br>
The twin-clutch transmission 10 is embodied as an automatic transmission. The shift<br>
clutch packs SK are connected to the two selector drums SWlc, SW2c. Correspond-<br>
ingly, the clutches Kl and K2 are also actuated automatically.<br>
The actuator arrangement according to the invention for the twin-clutch transmis-<br>
sion 10 has a first selector drum SWlc, which is arranged between the loose wheels of<br>
the gear stages 3, R on the second drive output shaft 18, and has a second selector<br>
drum SW2c which is arranged between the loose wheels of the gear stages 1, 2 on the<br><br>
12<br>
first drive output shaft 16. The selector drums SWlc, SW2c are mounted parallel to<br>
the shafts 16, 18 and are driven by schematically indicated motors, in particular by<br>
electric motors Ml and M2, respectively.<br>
Arranged on the first selector drum SWlc are a first control cam 40c, into which a<br>
first cam follower 48c engages, and a second control cam 42c, into which a second<br>
cam follower 50c engages.<br>
Arranged on the second selector drum SW2c are a third control cam 44c, into which<br>
a third cam follower 52c engages, and a fourth control cam 46c, into which a fourth<br>
cam follower 54c engages.<br>
The cam follower 48c is coupled to a selector sleeve which operates the shift clutch<br>
pack SK3/5. The cam follower 50c is coupled to a selector sleeve which operates the<br>
shift clutch pack SK4/R. The cam follower 52c is coupled to a selector sleeve which<br>
operates the shift clutch pack SKI. The cam follower 54c is coupled to a selector<br>
sleeve which operates the shift clutch pack SK2/6.<br>
Figure 2 shows the unwound views of two selector drums SW1, SW2 which can be<br>
assigned to an alternative twin-dutch transmission in which one drive output shaft<br>
is assigned the gear stages 1, 2, 6, R and the other drive output shaft is assigned the<br>
gear stages 3, 4, 5.<br>
Figures 3-6 show typical shift sequences with the selector drums of figure 2, as<br>
follows:<br>
For clarity, those positions of the cam followers 48-54 (for example sliding blocks) are<br>
considered which would result as the selector drums SW1, SW2 are rotated.<br>
The following state is taken as a starting point: a "start gear" is engaged and another<br>
"target gear" is additionally engaged. After the merging (crossfading) between the<br><br>
13<br>
clutches Kl, K2, the target gear remains in the shift position and the start gear is<br>
disengaged into neutral.<br>
Said positions are to be understood merely as examples since, depending on the shift<br>
strategy, a corresponding target gear can already be selected or another target gear is<br>
already pre-selected which must then initially be disengaged, or a corresponding start<br>
gear is not disengaged after the merging between the clutches. The capability of<br>
realizing shifts according to the invention is however maintained at all times.<br>
The shift sequence can analogously be transferred to the different gear positions,<br>
depending on the shift strategy, at the start of the shift demand.<br>
In figures 3 - 6, a solid dot denotes possible start positions, a checked dot denotes<br>
possible target positions, and a striped dot denotes an intermediate position.<br>
As illustrated, multiple downshifts can, according to the invention, be carried out<br>
directly, in particular without it being necessary to engage an intermediate gear.<br>
Here, the examples of figures 5 and 6 show situations in which a moderate downshift<br>
is initially carried out under traction (for example during a kickdown), and in which<br>
then (for example during a continued kickdown) a further downshift is carried out or<br>
a direct downshift is carried out via an intermediate gear without an interruption in<br>
tractive force.<br>
All the sequences are reversible. The multiple upshifts 2-5; 3-6; 2-3-6; 2-5-6 can<br>
therefore also be carried out directly. All the sequences can be applied in terms of<br>
their basic logic to all of the described embodiments. Here, at least one selector drum<br>
always rotates more then 360°.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show alternative embodiments.<br><br>

The shift actuating arrangement can generally be used in all transmission types. It<br>
can advantageously be used in front-transverse transmissions. It can advantageously<br>
be used in particular in front-transverse transmissions of 3-shaft design. It can par-<br>
ticularly advantageously be used in front-transverse transmissions which are of 3-<br>
shaft design and have an axially parallel arrangement of the shift devices / selector<br>
drums with respect to the drive output shafts. This permits an optimum adaptation<br>
of the shift device to the wheel set and therefore an optimum transmission package.<br>
The possibility of carrying out direct multiple shifts with a selector drum system<br>
having two selector drums is realized by means of at least one, preferably by means<br>
of a combination of the following points:<br>
- a selector drum system having two selector drums, with at least one selector<br>
drum which has an encircling groove;<br>
- at least one selector drum is rotatable through 360°;<br>
elimination of the separation of even/odd gears with respect to the selector<br>
drums;<br>
- 1/R are situated on one selector sleeve;<br>
- overlapping regions t) in the control cams of the selector drums make it<br>
possible with only one selector drum to actuate two successive gears within<br>
the context of the basic concept of a twin-dutch transmission (tractive force<br>
bridging) and to generate a state in which the two gears are engaged at the<br>
same time.<br>
Figure 9 shows a particularly preferred embodiment of an actuator arrangement<br>
having two selector drums SWlc, SW2c, which can be used in particular for the twin-<br>
clutch transmission 10 of figure 1. The mode of operation is generally comparable to<br>
the actuator arrangements of figures 2, 7 and 8. The following text describes substan-<br>
tially the differences in this regard.<br>
On the one hand, the 1st gear and the reverse gear are not situated on one synchro-<br>
nizing unit / selector sleeve. In addition, the 1st gear and the reverse gear R are also<br>
not controlled by means of one selector drum groove or one cam follower.<br><br>
15<br>
The selector drum SWlc is formed with encircling control cams 40c, 42c for the gears<br>
3, 5 and 4, R, respectively. In addition, the control cam 42c is equipped with a switch<br>
point 60, specifically for engaging or skipping the reverse gear.<br>
The design or actuation of the switch point 60 can correspond in principle to a<br>
moveable selector drum groove flank 62 (cf. figures 10, 11), specifically a selector<br>
drum engagement groove flank.<br>
The switch point 60 can be controlled by means of an auxiliary energy source,<br>
preferably by means of a spring force (spring 64).<br>
Alternatively, the switch point 60 is actively controlled (cf. figures 12, 13), for exam-<br>
ple by means of the other selector drum SW2c. In the illustrated case, the active<br>
control is provided by means of a coupling (coupling member 66) of the gear posi-<br>
tion of the 1st gear.<br>
Despite its increased complexity in terms of the shift, the variant of figures 9 - 13 is<br>
preferable since, with the associated wheel set structure, it is significantly easier to<br>
meet the requirements on said wheel set such as installation space, costs, transmis-<br>
sion ratio requirements, variability, and also the demand for a compact shift package.<br>
By introducing a switch point 60 on the selector drum SWlc with the encircling<br>
groove, said groove also has a stop for the reverse gear, by means of a groove end or<br>
by means of the blockage by the switch point 60 itself. Both drums can therefore also<br>
be referenced for software-based control.<br>
The shift sequence logic with passive (spring-force-controlled) switch point function<br>
is illustrated in figures 10 and 11.<br>
A further rotation of the selector drum SWlc beyond 360° is possible. The switch<br>
point 60 is deflected counter to the exerted spring force, and thereby bypassed, as it<br><br>
16<br>
impinges on the cam follower 50c (sliding block), for example by means of an<br>
inclined face.<br>
When the rotational direction is in the direction of R, the cam follower 50c is de-<br>
flected by the switch point 60, since the latter is held in the base position (engage-<br>
ment of R possible) by means of the spring force.<br>
The reverse gear can therefore be engaged independently of the other selector drum<br>
SW2c in a rotational-direction-dependent fashion.<br>
Multiple upshifts are therefore generally not possible.<br>
The shift sequence logic is expanded by means of an integrated switch point function<br>
which is actively controlled by means of the selector drum SW2c (figures 12,13).<br>
A further rotation of the selector drum SWlc beyond 360° is possible. The switch<br>
point 60 is bypassed.<br>
When the rotational direction of the selector drum SWlc is in the direction of R, the<br>
latter is not engaged for as long as the switch point 60, by means of its dependency<br>
on selector drum SW2c, for example by means of the engaged 1st gear, has not been<br>
activated. A movement of the selector drum below and beyond 0° can therefore take<br>
place. Multiple upshifts are also possible.<br>
Only when the movement direction of the drum 60 is in the direction of the reverse<br>
gear and the switch point 60 is simultaneously activated by means of selector drum<br>
SW2c, for example by the engaged Ist gear, is it possible to engage the reverse gear.<br>
The 1st and reverse gears can therefore be engaged at the same time on different<br>
partial transmissions. Driving away in the forward or reverse direction can therefore<br>
be carried out alternately (for example low-speed maneuvering, rocking free in the<br><br>
17<br>
event of the vehicle being stuck) without a gearshift and therefore in rapid succession<br>
in terms of time, since only the corresponding clutch of the partial transmission<br>
need be activated. The change of traveling direction therefore is therefore carried out<br>
merely by means of the alternation of the clutches Kl, K2.<br><br>
