COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
STRAIGHT SHACKLE COUNTER PADLOCK<br>
GODREJ &amp; BOYCE MFG. CO. LTD. of LOCKS DIVISION PLANT-18 PIROJSHANAGAR, VIKHROLI, MUMBAI - 400 079, MAHARASHTRA, India, INDIAN Company hereby declare : -<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
31-03-2004<br><br>
STRAIGHT SHACKLE COUNTER PADLOCK<br>
This invention relates to the Counter Padlock and more particularly Straight Shackle Counter Padlock.<br>
This invention relates to counter operated Padlock having different key combinations and specifically used for tracking the entry records. Heretofore, it was known to make padlock having single key which, was operated by a single person for locking and unlocking. Due to the single key / person control, these locks are susceptible for key duplication and to avoid this usually demands for very high technology, this has made the inventor to make a record of each locking and unlocking operation irrespective of the person and key (i.e. original or duplicate key). This is a very useful feature, generally required in banks (safe deposit vaults), post offices, government offices, hotels, transportation, shops, departmental stores where the indication of lock opening or closing is required.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a counter to record the operations of Padlock opening or closing which will enhance the padlock security irrespective  of technology and chances of key duplication.<br>
It is further object of the present invention to provide a padlock which has a higher safety and security by providing a proof of lock opening or closing by recording the operation as compared with the known padlock and at the same time is of simple construction and ease to manufacture.<br>
It is still further object of the invention to provide a straight shackle fully enclosed inside the body thereby making it difficult to cut by a hack saw or to open by a crow bar or similar object.<br>
The novel features of the present invention are set forth in particular in the appended claims. The invention itself will be best understood from the following<br>
2<br><br>
description    of    preferred embodiment taken together with the accompanying drawings.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1 to 4 in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1: shows the isometric view of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock<br>
Figure 2 : shows the basic views of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock<br>
Figure 3 : shows the sectional view of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock along the line AA.<br>
Figure 4 : shows the exploded view of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock.<br>
To illustrate the preferred embodiments of the invention, the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock comprising of the housing assembly and pin cylinder lock assembly. The housing assembly further comprises of the case (8) having a hole (11) to slideably receive the locking member (shackle) (12) having a recess (13) adapted to be engaged by driving crank (4) of pin cylinder assembly to provide the locking and unlocking of the straight shackle counter padlock. The housing has a recess to receive the pin cylinder assembly, which is integrated with the housing by rivet (21). The shackle is slideably retained by the rivet (9) riveted to housing (8), which is normally retained in protracted (unlocked) position by spring (10). The housing assembly further comprises of a mechanical counter (15) housed in case (8) and retained by a cover plate (14) riveted to the case (8) by rivets (19). The counter (15) is further provided with a lever block (18) with biasing spring (17) and a retainer plate (16) to receive a movement from a crank lever (6) fitted on cylinder plug (5) by the means of screw(7).<br>
3<br><br>
The Straight Shackle Counter Padlock comprising of the housing assembly and pin. cylinder lock assembly ; said housing assembly further comprises of the case (8) having a hole (11) to slideably receive the locking member (shackle) (12) having a recess (13) adapted to be engaged by driving crank of pin cylinder assembly to provide the locking and unlocking of the straight shackle counter padlock ; said housing has a recess to receive the pin cylinder assembly , which is integrated with the housing by rivet (21) ; said shackle is slideably retained by a rivet (9) riveted to case (8) which is normally retained in protracted (unlocked) position by spring (10).<br>
The Straight Shackle Counter Padlock wherein the pin cylinder assembly comprises of housing (20) having axial slots to receive cylinder (2) and plug (5) which are engaged with the driving crank (4) and rotatably retained in the housing (20) by circlips (3) ; the said crank (4) adapted to be engaged radially in the recess (15) of a shackle thereby providing the locking and unlocking of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock.<br>
The Straight Shackle Counter Padlock wherein the cylinder (2) has a plurality of holes to retain operating pins (24) and driver pins (25) adapted to be engaged with the key (1) and retain its position by springs (23), the plugs (22) are riveted into the housing to retain the springs into the holes of the housing (20); the operating pins (24) and the driver pins (25) are aligned along with the shear line of the cylinder and housing when the key is inserted into the cylinder, hence allowing cylinder to rotate along with the crank thereby providing the locking and unlocking of the Straight Shackle Counter Padlock.<br>
The material, shape and size of the component may vary according to requirement and application.<br>
4<br><br>
From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects herein above set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent in the lock.<br>
It will be understood that certain features and sub-combinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and sub combinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims.<br>
As many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matters herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limited sense.<br>
5<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
