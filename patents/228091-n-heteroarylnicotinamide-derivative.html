				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
N-HETEROARYLNICOTINAMIDE DERIVATIVE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to specific N-<br>
heteroaryl-4-(haloalkyl) nicotinamide derivatives, salts<br>
thereof and pesticides containing them as an active<br>
component.<br>
Further, the present invention relates to a method<br>
for producing the N-heteroaryl-4-(haloalkyl) nicotinamide<br>
derivatives and intermediates thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, some of commercially available<br>
insecticides are restricted in their use in view of<br>
problems of persistency, accumulation and environmental<br>
pollution. Further, by using the same insecticide for a<br>
long period of time, generation of resistant pest insects<br>
is growing to be a problem. Therefore, it has been desired<br>
to develop an insecticide having a novel molecular<br>
structure, which is considered to have an action different<br>
from that of the commercially available insecticides.<br>
Heretofore, as the N-heteroaryl-4-(trifluoromethyl)<br>
nicotinamide derivative, for example, Japanese Provisional<br>
Patent Publication No. Hei 10-195072 describes compounds<br>
having a 2-thiazolyl group or a 1,3,4-thiadiazole group as<br>
a heteroaryl group, and noxious animal controllers<br>
containing those as an active component. However, these<br>
compounds are different in the heteroaryl group from those<br>
of the invention in this application, and moreover, are<br>
insufficient in an insecticidal effect thereof.<br>
Furthermore, a 4-trifluoromethyl pyridine having a<br><br>
cyano group, a carbamoyl group or a carboxyl group at<br>
position 3 is useful as a manufacturing material of<br>
pesticides or medicines, and can be a production<br>
intermediate of the N-heteroaryl-4-(trifluoromethyl)<br>
nicotinamide derivative.<br>
As a production method of this intermediate for the<br>
production, conventionally known are Journal of Medicinal<br>
Chemistry, vol. 10, 1967, pp. 149-154, Japanese Provisional<br>
Patent Publication No. Hei 6-321903, Japanese Provisional<br>
Patent Publication No. Hei 7-10841 and Japanese Provisional<br>
Patent Publication No. 2000-38385, etc. Among these,<br>
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 10, 1967, pp. 149-154<br>
describes that 3-cyano-4-trifluoromethylpyridine is an<br>
intermediate for the production of a lipolysis inhibitor<br>
produced by converting a cyano group into a tetrazolyl<br>
group. Further, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No.<br>
Hei 6-321903, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No.<br>
Hei 7-10841 and Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No.<br>
2000-38385 describe that 4-trifluoromethylpyridine having a<br>
cyano group or a carbamoyl group at position 3 is an<br>
intermediate for the production of a noxious animal<br>
controller.<br>
However, the above-described methods have a problem<br>
that the number of steps is large or a step having rigorous<br>
reaction conditions is contained, therefore, it has been<br>
desired to develop a more industrially advantageous<br>
production method.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
As a result of extensive investigations on a 4-<br>
(haloalkyl) nicotinamide derivative, the present inventors<br>
have found that a specific N-heteroaryl-4-(haloalkyl)<br>
nicotinamide derivative has extremely excellent<br><br>
insecticidal activities against various kinds of harmful insects and the present<br>
has been accomplished.<br>
Furthermore, the present inventors have found a novel method for<br>
producing the N-heteroaryl-4- (haloalkyl) nicotinamide derivatives. In particular,<br>
the present inventors have found an industrially advantageous method for<br>
inexpensively and simply producing in a high yield a 4-substituted pyridine<br>
compound having a cyano group, a carbamoyl group or a carboxyl group at<br>
position 3, which is a production intermediate. The present invention has been<br>
accomplished based on this finding.<br>

When the compound of the present invention is used<br>

itself. However, it can be formulated into various<br>
formulations such as an emulsifiable concentrate, a<br>
suspension, a dust, a granule, a tablet, a wettable powder,<br>

proportions that the active component is from 0.1 to 9.0<br>
parts by mass and the agricultural adjuvant is from 10 to<br>

solid carrier may include, for example, animal and plant<br>
powders such as starch, activated charcoal, soybean powder,<br>
wheat flour, wood flour, fish flour and powdered milk; and<br>

When these formulations are practically used, they<br>
may be used directly or after diluted with a diluent such<br>
as water to a predetermined concentration. Various<br>
formulations containing the compounds of the present<br>
invention, whether diluted or not, may be applied by<br>
conventional methods, i.e., application methods (such as<br>
spraying, misting, atomizing, dusting, granule application,<br><br>
submerged application and seeding box application), soil<br>
treatment (such as mixing or drenching), surface<br>
application (such as painting, dressing and covering),<br>
dipping or poison bait. Further, the above active<br>
components may be incorporated into livestock feeds for<br>
feeding so as to prevent pest insects after they are voided<br>
in excrement, especially, infestation or growth of pest<br>
insects. Otherwise, they can also be applied by a so-<br>
called application method in low volume at ultra high<br>
concentration. In this method, the active component may be<br>
contained up to 100%.<br>
The pesticides of the present invention are applied<br>
usually at an active component concentration of from 0.1 to<br>
50000 ppm and preferably from 1 to 10000 ppm. However, the<br>
active component concentration can be suitably changed in<br>
accordance with the type of formulation, and the method,<br>
the purpose, the season or the site of application, and the<br>
infestation degree of the pest. For example, in a case of<br>
an aquatic pest, the pest can be controlled also when<br>
applying a formulation within the above-described<br>
concentration range to the infested site and therefore, the<br>
concentration of the active component in water may be below<br>
the above-described range. In a case of soil admixture<br>
treatment, the dose of pesticides of the present invention<br>
is, for example, from 0.1 to 5000 g and preferably from 1<br>
to 1000 g, per 10 ares in terms of the compound that serves<br>
as the active component.<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
The compounds of the present invention are described<br>
in detail below by referring to Examples, Reference<br>
Examples, Formulation Examples and Test Examples, however,<br>

(Example 1)<br>
N-(3-Methyl-5-isoxazolyl)-4-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)nicotinamide (Compound No. 1-2, Step A-1)<br><br><br>
5-Amino-3-methylisoxazole (147 mg, 1.5 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in dimethylformamide (5 ml), sodium hydride (60%<br>
dispersion in mineral oil, 72 mg, 1.8 mmol) was added and<br>
subsequently, 4-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid chloride (314<br>
mg, 1.5 mmol) was added under ice-cooling. The mixture was<br>
stirred under heating at 80°C for 2 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture was poured into ice-water and extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine and then<br>
dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was<br>
removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the<br>
resulting residue was purified by thin layer chromatography<br>
(a developing solvent: ethyl acetate/hexane=1/1) to obtain<br>
the title compound (181 mg, yield 44%).<br>
