				<td>FIELD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the bio-decaffeination of caffeine. It also relates to a simple, safe, and efficient process for the complete bio-decaffeination of caffeine-containing solutions using Pseudomonas alcaligenes CFR 1708, a method of isolating pseudomonas alcaligenes CFR 1708 useful for the bio-decaffeination of caffeine-containing solutions, a Pseudomonas alcaligenes strain of accession number CFR 1708, and a decaffeinated solution obtained by aforementioned process.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Caffeine (C8H10N4O2) is an alkaloid naturally occurring in coffee and coca beans cola nuts and tea<br>
leaves. Caffeine is described as a methylated xanthine alkaloid derivative (1,3 7 Trimethyl xanthine).<br>
Caffeine is water soluble above 175 degree F and is soluble in methanol, ethanol etc. In mammals<br>
ingested caffeine is rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted in the urine as methyl Xanthine<br>
derivatives. Caffeine is mildly stimulating and is used as a therapeutic agent.<br>
Caffeine has become a ubiquitous drug. Caffeine is widely distributed in pharmaceutical preparations<br>
and beverages. It has a variety of biological effects. It stimulates the central nervous system, shows<br>
toxicity when fed excessively and is even mutagenic in-vitro. Theobromine shows caffeine like<br>
pharmacological activities but does not cause excessive reaction as caffeine, so used as diuretic.<br>
Many of the physiological effects of coffee beverage are due to their caffeine content. Dr. Karal Wimmer of Germany invented the process of removing caffeine from coffee. This process is known as decaffeination and the product is known as "Caffeine free Coffee" Reference may be made to the work on Coffee Solubilization: Commercial Processes and Techniques, Pintauro and Nicholas, D., (1975), wherein they have used methylene chloride for decaffeination of coffee. The drawback of this process is that the flavor elements and oil are drawn off from the beans; presence of residual solvent, which is not safe for human health and the time taken for the whole process, is more than 24 hours.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Zeller and Saleeb, Proceedings of 18.sup.th ASIC Colloquium (Helsinki), 168 172, (1999), wherein they have reported decaffeination of coffee beans using Ethyl Acetate. The drawback of this method is, it involves the use of organic solvent, which makes the process hazardous to health, expensive, time consuming and highly labour intensive.<br>
Reference may be made to Hinman and Saleeb (1984), (General Foods Corp.), European Patent No.: EP-0140269, Coffee Technology; wherein they have reported the decaffeination of coffee by Charcoal or carbon. The drawbacks of this process are loss of flavor elements and colour, presence of residual caffeine in the product in addition to the longer time duration involved in the whole process.<br><br>
Reference may be made to a patent by General Foods Corporation, USA, (1973), U.S. Pat. No.: Br. 1,313,047, Coffee Technology, wherein they have reported the use of Triglycerides. The drawbacks of this process are the loss of flavor and incomplete removal of caffeine from the final product.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Katz, S. N, Coffee Technology, (1987), wherein he has reported the use of supercritical CO.sub.2 for decaffeination. The drawback of this process is that although it does not affect the quality of the final product, it necessitates the extraction of caffeine to the surface of the bean by steam and involves very high costs and the caffeine is not completely removed from the final product.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Michael Gluck and Franz Lingens (1987), Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, 334 340, on the studies on microbial production of theobromine and heteroxanthine from caffeine wherein they have used a strain of Pseudomonas putida. The drawbacks of this process are that the cells grow very slow in the medium containing caffeine, degradation of caffeine was very slow and the accumulation of products was too low for commercial purposes and the products produced in this process have effects similar to that of caffeine.<br>
Reference may be made to the work of Wouter J. Middlehoven and Cor. M Bakker (1982) Eur. J Appl. Microbio. Biotechnol. 214 217, wherein they have reported the degradation of caffeine by immobilized cells of Pseudomonas putida strain C 3024 wherein they have immobilized the cells in beads of agar. The disadvantages of the process are the immobilization method tends to remove substances other than caffeine thus adversely affecting the flavor of roasted coffee and the growth yields of the cells are very low.<br>
Reference may be made to a Swiss patent by Robert, F. D., Nestle Group (1981) Patent No. CH626781 "Decaffeination process" on decaffeination of vegetable material when exposed to the microorganism of the species Acinetobacter. The disadvantage of this method is that caffeine removal from the coffee extract is very slow and only about half of the initial caffeine content is removed from the extract.<br>
Reference may be made to U.S. Pat. No. 4,228,191 (1980) wherein they have reported the use cell free extracts of Pseudomonad like organisms for decaffeination of aqueous caffeine containing liquids such as coffee extract. The disadvantage is the requirement of addition of cofactors for decaffeination, which are highly unstable.<br>

EXAMPLE-1<br>
After screening of various microorganisms isolated from coffee processing wastes, a<br>
bacterial culture is selected on the basis of caffeine degrading ability in a well-defined liquid<br>
media containing caffeine. Isolation of the microorganism was done by mixing one gram of<br>
soil sample with 100 ml of caffeine liquid medium in a 250 ml flask and incubation for 72<br>
hrs at 30°C in an orbital rotary shaker set at 150 rpm. Caffeine agar medium was prepared<br>
and poured into petri plates. Then ten-fold serial dilutions (10"1 to 10"9) of the above grown<br>
culture were made and O.lml of the dilutions was inoculated on to each plate and incubated<br>
at 37°C for 2 days.<br>
Isolated colonies growing on the above plates were selected and purified further to obtain<br>
pure cultures. On the basis of colony morphology, well-separated colonies of the caffeine<br>
degrading bacteria formed on incubated caffeine agar plates were selected and transferred<br>
aseptically into fresh caffeine agar plates and incubated at 30° C for 72 hours. The organism<br>
is maintained by sub culturing on caffeine agar slants every 30 days. The bacteria is<br>
characterized by morphological, cultural and biochemical tests. The tests included Gram's<br>
reaction, catalase production, oxidase production, nitrate reduction, indole production,<br>
methyl red test, voges proskauer test, starch hydrolysis, citrate utilization, oxidation,<br>
fermentation of sugars, motility, malonate utilization, arginine dihydrolase activity, gelatin<br>
liquefaction, growth at 4°C and 41° C, acid slant, acid butt, alkaline slant, alkaline butt, H^S<br>
production, gas production, urease production, dextrose utilization, mannitol utilization and<br>
polyhydroxy alkanoate accumulation and the results are shown in table 1.<br>
The taxonomic features of the bacteria, Pseudomonas alcaligenes are summarized as follows:<br>
The bacterial colonies were round, small, raised and smooth and microscopic observation<br>
revealed that the bacteria were Gram-negative coccobacilli. The cultural and biochemical<br>
tests carried out for the identification of the isolate and the results are given in Table. 1.<br><br>
The isolate is positive for catalase production. Isolate is negative for oxidase production,<br>
nitrate reduction, indole production, methyl red test, voges proskauer test and starch<br>
hydrolysis. Isolate is positive for citrate utilization, oxidation, fermentation of sugars,<br>
motility, malonate utilization, arginine dihydrolase activity, negative for gelatin hydrolysis.<br>
The isolate showed growth at 41°C and growth is inhibited at 4° C. The isolate tested<br>
negative for Acid slant and butt, positive for alkaline slant and butt. The isolate is found to be<br>
a weak hydrogen sulphide producer. The isolate showed no gas production. The isolate tested<br>
positive for urease production and tested negative for dextrose utilization, mannitol<br>
utilization and polyhydroxy alkanoate production.<br>
On the basis of morphological, cultural and biochemical characteristics, the isolate: is<br>
identified as Pseudomonas alcaligenes and designated as CFR1708, and deposited at the<br>
Central Food Technological Research Institute Culture Collection.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
A loop full of actively growing culture of Pseudomonas alcaligenes is transferred to 100 ml<br>
of nutrient broth containing 0.3-g/L caffeine and incubated at 30°C in a rotary shaker at 120<br>
rpm for 24 hrs. 5 ml of the 24 hrs grown pre inoculum is transferred to 100 ml of nutrient<br>
broth containing Ig/L caffeine and incubated at 30°C for 48 hours on the rotary shaker.<br>
Biomass accumulated for 24 hours is harvested by centrifugation for 20 min in a bench top<br>
centrifuge at 16,000-x g at 4° C.<br>
This biomass is aseptically transferred into a 500 ml flask containing 100 ml of Caffeine<br>
liquid medium containing 0.5-g/L g of caffeine and incubated at 30°C on the rotary shaker<br>
for 48 hrs. Igm wet weight of the pellet of above induced biomass is suspended in 2 ml of<br>
0.1 M phosphate buffer. This suspension is then added to a flask containing 10 ml of caffeine<br>
liquid medium containing Ig/L caffeine adjusted to a pH of 5.0 and incubated at 30°C under<br>
agitation on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm. 1 ml aliquots of the medium are drawn at 2, 4, 6,12<br>
and 24 hours intervals, subjected to centrifugation at 16,000-x g for 10 minutes at 4° C and<br>
analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for caffeine content. There is a rapid<br>
degradation of caffeine, increasing from 54 % at 2 h to 96% in 6 hours of incubation (Fig.l).<br>
Example 3<br>
The cultivation of the organism is carried out as in example 1. However, the pH of the<br>
medium for decaffeination is adjusted to 6.0. The degradation of caffeine is much more<br>
efficient than at pH 5, giving values of 94.5 % at 2 hrs and 98% at 6 hours of incubation<br>
Example 4<br>
The cultivation of the organism is carried out as in example 1. However, the pH of the<br>
medium for decaffeination is adjusted to 7.0. Caffeine is completely removed from the<br>
solution within 2 hours of incubation (Fig.l).<br>
Example 5<br>
The cultivation of the organism is carried out as in example 1. However the pH of the<br>
medium for decaffeination is adjusted to 8.0. 99.3% of the caffeine is removed from the<br>
solution within 2 hours of incubation (Fig.l).<br>
The novelty of the present invention is to completely degrade caffeine rapidly and<br>
completely using a microbial culture grown in a synthetic liquid medium.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
• Degradation of caffeine occurs in the neutral pH range i.e., 7.0-8.0.<br>
• It is a rapid decaffeination method and completely degrades caffeine<br>
within 2-12 hours of incubation.<br>
• It avoids the use of hazardous organic solvents for the removal of caffeine.<br>
• It employs simple and inexpensive media for the cultivation of a culture of<br>
P.alcaligenes for the degradation of caffeine.<br>
• Prevents the loss of flavour elements and oils from the caffeine containing<br>
solutions.<br>
• Expedites the decaffeination.<br>
• Extremely economical.<br>
«, Easy to perform and not at all labour intensive.•	Cells of the bacterium of the instant application grow very fast unlike cells of the prior art.<br>
•	Accumulation of caffeine free product is high.<br>
•	The decaffeinated product is commercially useful.<br>
•	Does not require cofactors [usually unstable] for decaffeination.<br>
We claim:<br>
