[0011]<br>
Referring first to Fig. 1 to Fig. 3, a vehicle body frame 1 of a motorcycle M includes a head pipe 2, a main tube 3 extending from the rear face of the upper portion of the head pipe 2 making a gradual decent toward the rear and then bent at a midsection downward, a down tube 4 extending from the rear face of the lower portion of the head pipe 2 making a steep descent toward the rear, a pair of left and right seat rails 5 extending rearward from both left and right sides of the main tube 3 at the position before bending , a pair of left and right stays 6 connecting the midsection of the seat rail 5 and the lower end of the main tube 3, a front cross member 7 welded<br>
at the front ends of the seat rails 5 to connect therebetween, and a rear cross member 8 welded to rear ends of the seat rails 5 so as to connect therebetween. A front fork 10 for supporting a front wheel 9f is steerably supported by the head pipe 2, the a rear fork 11 for supporting a rear wheel 9r is rotatably supported by the rear portion of the main tube 3 for a vertical swinging motion. A rear cushion 12 is attached between the rear fork 11 and the aforementioned seat rail 5.<br>
[0012]<br>
Engine hangers 13 and 14 are formed at the lower ends of the main tube 3 and the down tube 4, which support the front and rear ends of an engine E. The output of the engine E is transmitted to the rear wheel 9r via a chain transmission device stored in a chain case 15 mounted to the rear fork 11.<br>
[0013]<br>
A fuel tank 18 mounted to and supported by the main tube 3 is disposed above the engine E. In this case, a tongue strip 18a projected from the rear end of the fuel tank 18 is fixed to the front cross member 7 via a resilient member 29 by a bolt 28.<br>
[0014]<br>
Auxiliary machineries 19 (See Fig. 3) such as a buttery, an air cleaner, and the like are disposed in a triangle space defined by the main tube 3, the seat rails 5 and the stays 6, and a compartment 20 formed above a rear fender 50 mounted to<br>
the seat rails 5 is disposed between the left and right seat rails 5, and an occupants tandem seat 21 is attached to the left and the right seat rails 5 so as to be capable of being detached, that is, being opened and closed, and covers the auxiliary machineries 19 and the compartment 20 from above. A pair of left and right side covers 22, which cover the auxiliary machineries 19 from both left and right sides, are detachable mounted to the vehicle body frame 1.<br>
[0015]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, a mounting structure of the aforementioned seat 21 will be described.<br>
[0016]<br>
A bottom plate 21a of the seat 21 is provided with a supporting strip 23 to be removably inserted below the front cross member 7, a plurality of resilient members 24 placed on the left and the right seat rails 5, and a lock pin 25 held by a seat lock device 26 disposed on the rear cross member 8. Therefore, by inserting the supporting strip 23 below the front cross member 7, and engaging the lock pin 25 with the seat lock device 26 while compressing the resilient supporting member 24 on the seat rails 5, the seat 21 may be held on the seat rails 5 without rattling, and the auxiliary machineries 19 and the compartment 20 may be protected from being tampered. When the operation of the seat lock device 26 is released, the seat 21 may be removed from the seat rail 5 to enable maintenance<br>
of the auxiliary machineries 19 and taking in and out of the articles from/into the compartment 20.<br>
[0017]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5 to Fig. 8, a mounting structure of the aforementioned seat lock device 26 and the grab rail 27 that an occupant sitting on the rear portion of the seat 21 grabs will be described.<br>
[0018]<br>
The seat lock device 26 and the grab rail 27 are secured together to the rear cross member 8 with a common plurality of bolts 31. In other words, the seat lock device 26 is provided with a base plate 30 having mounting holes 32 on the left and the right ends thereof. On the other hand, the grab rail 27 is formed into an U-shape in plan view so as to surround the rear end of the aforementioned seat 21, and a pair of brackets<br>
33	formed at both left and right ends thereof so as to face<br>
inward are formed with a pair of left and right mounting holes<br>
34	corresponding to the mounting holes 32 of the aforementioned<br>
base plate 30, and a pair of left and right bolts 31<br>
corresponding to the aforementioned mounting holes 32 and the<br>
front mounting holes 34 are welded to the rear cross member<br>
8.<br>
[0019]<br>
Therefore, by fitting the mounting holes 32 of the base plate 30 of the seat lock device 2 6 onto the bolts 31, then<br>
fitting the front mounting holes 34 of the grab rail 27 onto the same bolts 31, and then screwing and fastening a nut 37 onto the same bolt 31, the base plate 30 of the seat lock device<br>
26	and the bracket 33 of the grab rail 27 can be secured together<br>
to the rear cross member 8 by the common bolt 31 and the nut<br>
37. In addition, the bracket 33 of the grab rail 27 is further<br>
fixedly secured to the rear cross member 8 by engaging and<br>
fastening the pair of left and right bolts 38 passing through<br>
the bracket 33 at the position rearwardly of the aforementioned<br>
left and right bolts 31 into the nuts 3 6 welded on the lower<br>
surfaces of the rear cross member 8.<br>
[0020]<br>
In this manner, the seat lock device 26 and the grab rail<br>
27	may be mounted to the rear cross member 8 of the vehicle<br>
body frame 1 without providing a bracket specific for the seat<br>
lock device 26 on the grab rail 27, which contributes to<br>
simplification of the construction and hence reduction of the<br>
production cost.<br>
[0021]<br>
As clearly shown in Fig. 7, the left and the right brackets 33 of the grab rail 27 are integrally formed with the left and the right pair of protective walls 39 facing toward each other with the seat lock device 26 interposed therebetween, and the upper ends of the protective walls 39 are adapted to be projected into the left and the right recesses 40 formed on<br>
the bottom plate 21a when the seat 21 is fixed in place. Therefore, the left and the right protective walls 39 may prevent the seat lock device 26 from being tampered with in cooperation with left and the right side walls of the bottom plate 21a of the seat 21. In addition, since the aforementioned protective wall 39 is integrally formed with the grab rail 27, increase in number of components may be prevented.<br>
[0022]<br>
In the seat lock device 26, a housing 30a, which rises in the shape of an angular C-shape in cross section, is formed at the midsection of the base plate 30, and the rear end of a lock lever 41 in the housing 30a is supported by the housing 30a via a pivot 42. A lock spring 43 for urging the lock lever 41 toward one side is provided between the distal end of the lock lever 41 and an end of the base plate 3 0 in the lateral direction. A stopper 44 for defining the rotational limit of a lock spring 43 in the direction of an urging force thereof is provided on the base plate 3 0, and the lock lever 41 is adapted in such a manner that when the lock lever 41 abuts to the stopper 44, an end of the lever 41 is exposed through a guide hole 45 opened at the center of the housing 30a. Therefore, when the aforementioned lock pin 25 of the seat 21 is inserted into the guide hole 45, and a harpoon-shaped enlarged head 25a of the lock pin 25 passes through while wedging an end of the lock lever 41, the lock lever 41 rotates again toward the lock pin<br>
25 by an urging force of the lock spring 43, and engages the portion corresponding to the neck of the enlarged head 25a, and locks the seat 21 at the predetermined mounting position.<br>
[0023]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a cylinder lock 4 8 is attached to a bracket 4 7 welded to the rear end of one of the seat rails 5 and extending downward, and an operating arm (not shown) provided at the inner end of the rotating element of the cylinder lock 48 is connected to the distal end of the aforementioned lock lever 41 via an interlocking wire 49 (See Fig. 6). The aforementioned cylinder lock 48 may be operated only by a specific key, not shown, and when an operation to open the cylinder lock 4 8 is performed by the key, the interlocking wire 49 is pulled, and thus the lock lever 41 is rotated against an urging force of the lock spring 43 so that the lock pin 25 is released.<br>
[0024]<br>
Subsequently, according to Fig. 5 to Fig. 11, the rear fender 50 and the aforementioned compartment 20 covering over the upper surface of the rear wheel 9r will be described.<br>
[0025]<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the rear fender 50 is attached to the vehicle body frame 1 by securing the front end thereof to a bracket 51 fixed to the stay 6 of the vehicle body frame 1 with a bolt 52, and securing the rear end thereof to<br>
a bracket 54, which is welded to the rear end of the seat rail 5 and suspended therefrom with a bolt 53.<br>
[0026]<br>
The upper surface of the rear fender 50 is integrally formed with a box 55 being opened on top as shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 7, and Fig. 11, the compartment 2 0 is constructed of the box 55 and a cover 57 connected to the box 55 with a machine screw 56 (See Fig. 11) so as to cover the upper surface thereof. A lid 58 is integrally connected to the front end of the cover 57 via a flexible hinge 59 in such a manner that the front end of the compartment 20 is capable of being opened and closed. The compartment 2 0 is disposed below the rear cross member 8 formed in a shape of a footstool.<br>
[0027]<br>
Therefore, as described above, when the operation of the seat lock device 2 6 is released and the seat 21 is removed from the vehicle body frame 1, the articles may be taken in and out from the compartment 20 by opening and closing the lid 58.<br>
[0028]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2 and Fig. 14 to Fig. 16, the side cover 22 will be described.<br>
[0029]<br>
Since the left and the right side covers 22 are constructed symmetrically, only one of them will be described.<br>
[0030]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the side cover 22 includes a front side cover 22f and rear side cover 22r continuing from the rear end thereof.<br>
[0031]<br>
In Fig. 2, Fig. 10, and Fig. 14, the rear side cover 22r is supported by the rear fender 50 by engaging a locking projection 61 projecting from the midsection in the fore-and-aft direction of the inner wall with a locking hole 62 of the side wall of the rear fender 50, and securing the lower rear portion to the rear fender 50 with a machine screw 63.<br>
[0032]<br>
As shown in Fig. 15, a louvered decorative laminate 65 is attached to the outer surface of the front end of the rear side cover 22r with a locking claw 66 and a machine screw 67, so that a insertion port 64 for allowing the rear end of the front side cover 22f to be inserted is defined therebetween.<br>
[0033]<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 12, and Fig. 13, the front side cover 22f is supported by the vehicle body frame 1 by engaging a locking projection 68 projecting from the inner wall of the upper front end thereof with a locking hole 70 of a bracket 69 fixedly provided on the main tube 3, and securing the lower front portion to a bracket 71, the lower front portion of which is fixed to the stay 6, by a bolt 73 via a distance collar 72.<br>
[0034]<br>
In this case, since the rear end of the front side cover 22f is inserted into the aforementioned insertion port 64, and is covered by the decorative laminate 65, improvement of the appearance is achieved.<br>
[0035]<br>
In addition, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 16, the upper midsection of the front side cover 22f and the upper front end of the rear side cover 22r are connected by a machine screw 74, and thus the rigidity of the side cover 22 is enhanced. Since the joint thereof is covered by the sidewall of the bottom plate 21a of the seat 21, it makes a good show.<br>
[0036]<br>
In Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 8, the rear ends of the left and the right rear side covers 22r are connected with each other by a rear cover 76, and the rear cover 76 is supported by a bracket 77 secured to the aforementioned rear cross member 8 by a bolt 78. A tail lamp 80 is mounted to the lower portion of the rear cover 76.<br>
[0037]<br>
