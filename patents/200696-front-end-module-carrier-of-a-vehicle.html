				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a front end module carrier of a vehicle. More particularly, it relates to a front end module carrier for integrally connecting and installing the various components of the front end module. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The front end module of a vehicle packs into a single unit the radiator, the horn speaker, the hood latch, the headlamps and the like, and the front end module carrier is a frame structure used for packing the front components to form the front end module.<br>
The conventional front end module carrier includes a radiator installation part consisting of an upper frame and a support frame, a middle frame laterally crossing the radiator installation part, a stay extending from the front center of the upper frame to the center of the middle frame and a pair of head lamp installation parts formed at both ends of the radiator installation part.<br>
A radiator is installed between the upper frame and the support frame. The middle frame which is connected through the stay to the upper frame is mounted on a bumper rail that is installed for securing the front bumper of the vehicle. The hood is locked by a hood latch that is installed at a connection part between the upper frame and the stay thereby preventing from being opened upward.<br>
However, the middle frame is simply mounted on the bumper rail. Consequently, if an ill- intentioned person<br><br>
forcibly opens the hood upward, then the hood cannot firmly withstand against such lifting force. Furthermore, a center portion where the hood latch of the upper frame is installed, is formed with a bent plate such that the hood cannot sufficiently withstand against a forced lifting attempt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a front end module carrier in which the hood has a strong rigidity and a strong withstanding strength against a forced lift force, so as to defeat a non- authorized lifting of the hood.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a front end module carrier of a vehicle, comprising an upper frame; a lower frame installed beneath the upper frame to form a radiator installation space; a side frame for forming a pair of head lamp installation spaces at both ends of the radiator installation space; and a stay projecting from the center of the upper frame to its lower front so as to be coupled to a bumper rail; and a bumper rail fixing part provided beneath the side<br>
frame for installing the bumper rail, wherein, an auxiliary rail)is installed on the bumper rail, the bumper rail and the auxiliary rail  are connected together by means of a connection plate, and the stay is coupled to the bumper rail and the connection plate by means of a plurality of bolts.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates the conventional front-end module carrier of a vehicle;<br>
-Or<br><br>
FIG.   2   illustrates   the   front end   module   carrier   of   FlG.   1 installed on a vehicle;<br>
FIG.  3 is a perspective view of the front-end module carrier of a vehicle according to the present invention;<br>
FIG. 4 is a frontal view showing the connected state of  the bumper rail and auxiliary rail to the front-end module carrier of FIG.<br><br>
FIG. 5 is a sectional view taken across the central portion of the front end module carrier, with the front end module carrier being installed on the vehicle body; and<br>
FIG. 6 is a partial sectional view of a reinforcing member<br>
which is installed on an upper frame.. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
The conventional front end module carrier 100 as shown in Fig. 1 includes a radiator installation part RS consisting of an upper frame 102 and a support frame 104, a middle frame 106 laterally crossing the radiator installation part RS, a stay 108 extending from the front center of the upper frame 102 to the center of the middle frame 106, and a pair of head lamp installation parts HS formed at both ends of the radiator installation part RS.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a radiator R is installed between the upper frame 102 and the support frame 104. The middle frame 106 which is connected through the stay 108 to the upper frame 102 is mounted on a bumper rail 114 that is installed for securing the front bumper 112 of the vehicle. The hood H is locked by a hood latch 116 that is installed at a connection part between the upper frame 102 and the stay 108, thereby preventing from being opened upward.<br>
However, the middle frame 106 is simply mounted on the bumper rail 114. Consequently, if an ill- intentioned person forcibly opens the hood H upward, then the hood H cannot<br>
3<br><br>
firmly withstand against  such, lifting  force.   Furthermore,   a center portion where  the hood latch 116  of  the upper  frame 102   is  installed,   is  formed with a bent plate  such that  the hood H cannot  sufficiently withstand against  a  forced lifting attempt   as   shown  in FIG.   2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
As shown in FlGs. 3 to 5, the front-end module carrier according to the present invention includes: an upper frame 3; a lower frame 5 installed beneath the upper frame 3 to form a radiator installation space RS; a side frame 7 for forming a pair of head lamp installation spaces HS at both ends of the radiator installation space RS; and a stay 11 projecting from the center of the upper frame 3 to its lower front so as to be coupled to a bumper rail 9. Further, a bumper rail fixing part 13 is provided beneath the side frame 7, for installing the bumper rail 9.<br>
The upper frame 3 is made of steel, while the lower frame 5, the side frame 7 and the bumper rail securing part 13 are made of a plastic material by an injection molding.<br><br>
As can be known by referring to F.I.G. 5. the portion where the stay 11 is installed   on   the   upper   frame   3 is  is overlapped with the<br>
portion  where  the  hood  latch   15  is   installed  on  the  upper  frame  3. Thereupon, the hood latch 15 is installed.<br>
The coupling of the stay 11 to the bumper rail 9 will be described by referring to FIGs. 4 and 5. That is the auxiliary rail 17 is provided, upon the bumper rail 9, while the bumper rail 9 and the auxiliary rail 17 are connectec together by a connection plate 19 Further, the stay 11 is coupled to the bumper rail 9 and to the connection plate by using two bolts 21.<br>
Accordingly, unlike the conventional technicue the stay 11 and the bumper rail 9 are firmly coupied together by using the bolts 21 and thus, tne bumper rail 9 firmly supports the upper frame 3 and the nood H to resist against any non-authorized lifling of the hood Therefore, any ill-intentioned attempt to open the hood H can be well defeated.<br>
Further, a reinforcing member 23 is insttalled or a portionn of the upper frame 3 where the hood latch 15 is installed as shown in FIG. 6, in such a manner that a closed cross section should be formed. This is for preventing any deformation of the upper frame 3, when an ill-intentioned attempt to open the hood is perpetrated.<br><br>
5<br><br>
According the front end mocole carrier according	 to the present on makes powerless any ill-intentioned or non authorrized attempt to open the hood H, because the rigialty of the upper freme 3 is reinforced, and the coupling between the stay 11 and the bumper rail 9 is strengthened. Thus a firm structural Characteristic is provided.<br>
According to the present invention as described above, the rigidity of the upper frame is reinforced and the coupling between the stay and the bumper rail is strengthened. Therefore, any non-authorized attempt to open the hood can be well defeated, and any such intruder can be made powerless.<br>
The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention are presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously many modifications and variations are possible in view of the above teachings. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical applications, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use    contemplated.It is   intended   mat   the   scope   of    the   invention   be<br>
