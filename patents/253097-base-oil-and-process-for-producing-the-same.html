Technical field<br>
The invention relates to a process for producing a hydrocarbon component, and<br>
particularly a process for producing high-quality branched saturated hydrocarbon<br>
component of biological origin to be used as new type base oil.The process<br>
comprising aldol condensation, hydrodeoxygenation and isomerization steps<br>
utilizes feedstock, which preferably originates from raw material of biological<br>
origin, eventually derived from plant oils, animal fats, natural waxes, and<br>
carbohydrates. Also corresponding synthetic materials and combinations thereof<br>
may be used as feedstock.<br>
Prior art<br>
Base oils are commonly used for the production of lubricants, such as lubricating<br>
oils for automotives, industrial lubricants and lubricating greases. They are also<br>
used as process oils, white oils and metal working oils. Finished lubricants consist<br>
of two general components, lubricating base oil and additives. Lubricating base<br>
oil is the major constituent in these finished lubricants and contributes<br>
significantly to the properties of the finished lubricant. In general, a few<br>
lubricating base oils are used to manufacture a wide variety of finished lubricants<br>
by varying the mixtures of individual lubricating base oils and individual<br>
additives.<br>
Base oils according to the classification of the American Petroleum Institute (API)<br>
Group III or IV are used in high-quality lubricants. API base oil classification is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Oils of the Group III are base oils with very high viscosity indices (VHVI)<br>
produced by modern methods from crude oil by hydrocracking, followed by<br>
isomerization of the waxy linear paraffins to give branched paraffins. Oils of<br>
Group III also include base oils produced from Slack Wax paraffins from mineral<br>
oils, and from waxes obtained by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (GTL waxes) for<br>
instance from coal or natural gas using corresponding isomerization techniques;<br>
Oils of Group IV are synthetic polyalphaolefins (PAO). A similar classification is<br>
also used by ATIEL (Association Technique de l'lndustrie Europeenne des<br>
Lubrifiants, or Technical Association of the European Lubricants Industry), said<br>
classification also comprising Group VI: Polyiniernalolefins (PIO). In addition to<br>
the official classification, also Group 11+ is commonly used in this field, this<br>
group comprising saturated and non-sulfurous base oils having viscosity indices<br>
of more than 110, but below 120. In these classifications saturated hydrocarbons<br>
include paraffinic and naphthenic compounds, but not aromatics.<br>
There is also available a definition for base stocks according to API 1509: "A base<br>
stock is a lubricant component that is produced by a single manufacturer to the<br>
same specifications (independent of feed source or manufacturer's location); that<br>
meets the same manufacturer's specification; and that is identified by a unique<br>
formula, product identification number, or both. Base stocks may be<br><br>
manufactured using a variety of different processes". Base oil is the base stock or<br>
blend of base stocks used in API-licensed oil. The base stock types are 1) Mineral<br>
oil (paraffmic, naphthenic, aromatic), 2) Synthetic (polyalphaolefins, alkylated<br>
aromatics, diesters, polyol esters, polyalkylene glycols, phosphate esters,<br>
silicones), and 3) Plant oil.<br>
Already for a. long time, especially the automotive industry has required lubricants<br>
and thus base oils with improved technical properties. Increasingly, the<br>
specifications for finished lubricants require products with excellent low<br>
temperature properties, high oxidation stability and low volatility. Generally<br>
lubricating base oils are base oils having kinematic viscosity of about 3 cSt or<br>
greater at 100 °C (KV100); pour point (PP) of about -12 °C or less; and viscosity<br>
index (VI) about 100 or greater. In general, lubricating base oils should have a<br>
Noack volatility no greater than current conventional Group I or Group II light<br>
neutral oils.<br>
It is no longer possible to produce lubricants complying with the specifications of<br>
the most demanding car manufacturers from conventional mineral oils. Typically,<br>
mineral oils often contain too high concentrations of aromatic, sulfur, and<br>
nitrogen compounds, and further, they also have a high volatility and a modest<br>
viscosity index, that is, viscosity-temperature dependence. Moreover, response of<br>
mineral oils to antioxidant additives is often low. Synthetic and so-called.semi-<br>
synthetic base oils play an increasingly important role especially in automotive<br>
lubricants, such as in engine and gear oils. A similar development can be seen for<br>
industrial lubricants. Service life of lubricants is desirably as long as possible, thus<br>
avoiding frequent oil changes by the user, and further allowing extended<br>
maintenance intervals of vehicles for instance in commercial transportation. In the<br>
past decade, engine oil change intervals for passenger cars have increased five<br>
fold, being at best 50.000 km. For heavy-duty vehicles, engine oil change<br>
intervals are at present already on the level of 100,000 km.<br><br>
Production of lubricants is influenced by increasingly common "Life Cycle<br>
Approach" (LCA) concerning environment, health and safety factors of the<br>
product. What is aimed with LCA are an extended service life of the product, and<br>
minimal drawbacks to the environments associated with the production, use,<br>
handling and disposal of the product. Longer oil change intervals of high-quality<br>
base oils result in decreased consumption of non-renewable mineral crude oil<br>
based raw materials, and lower amounts of hazardous waste oil products.<br>
In addition to the demands for engine technology and base oil production, also<br>
strict environmental requirements direct the industry to develop more<br>
sophisticated base oils. Sulfur free fuels and base oils are required in order to gain<br>
full effect of new and efficient anti-pollution technologies in modern vehicles and<br>
to cut emissions of nitrogen oxides, volatile hydrocarbons and particles, as well as<br>
to achieve direct reduction of sulfur dioxide in exhaust gases. The European<br>
Union has decided that these fuels shall be available to the market from 2005 and<br>
they must be the only form on sale from 2009. Conventional mineral oil base oils<br>
contain sulfur, nitrogen, aromatic compounds, and typically also volatile<br>
compounds. They are less suitable for new engines and thus also environmentally<br>
more detrimental than newer sulfur and aromatic free base oils.<br>
Nowadays, the use of recycled oils and renewable raw materials in the production<br>
of lubricants is frequently an object of interest. The use of renewable raw<br>
materials of biological origin instead of non-renewable fossil raw materials to<br>
produce hydrocarbon components is desirable, because the fossil raw materials<br>
are exhaustible and their effect on environment is detrimental. Problems<br>
associated with recycled oils include complicated purification and reprocessing<br>
steps to obtain base oils with high quality, Further, the development of a<br>
functioning and extensive recycling logistic system is expensive.<br>
For the time being, only esters are used in lubricants of renewable and biological<br>
origin. The use of said esters is limited to a few special applications such as oils<br><br>
for refrigeration compressor lubricants, bio-hydraulic oils and metal working oils.<br>
In normal automotive and industrial lubricants, they are used mainly in additive<br>
scale. Also high price limits the use of esters. In addition, the esters used in engine<br>
oil formulations are not interchangeable with other esters without performing new<br>
engine tests, even in cases where the chemical composition of the substituting<br>
ester is in principle similar. Instead, base oils consisting of pure hydrocarbon<br>
structure are partly interchangeable with each other. There are also some technical<br>
problems associated with esters. As polar compounds, esters suffer greater seal-<br>
swelling tendency than pure hydrocarbons. This has created lot of problems<br>
relating to elastomers in hydraulic applications. In addition, ester base oils are<br>
hydrolyzed more easily producing acids, which in turn cause corrosion on<br>
lubricating systems. Further, even greater disadvantage of esters is that additives<br>
developed for non-polar hydrocarbon base oils are not effective for ester base oils.<br>
Processes for producing unsaturated and branched aldehydes having longer<br>
hydrocarbon chains are available starting from aldehydes and ketones using aldol<br>
condensation reaction. The reaction proceeds through aldol condensation to give<br>
hydroxy aldehyde, or hydroxy ketone, followed by cleavage of water yielding<br>
unsaturated aldehyde or unsaturated ketone, depending on feed. In the reaction,<br>
typically basic catalysts are used at a temperature of 80 to 400 °C. Basic<br>
homogeneous catalysts such as NaOH and Ca(OH)2, and supported alkali metals<br>
like Na/SiO2 may be mentioned as heterogeneous catalysts, as described by Kelly,<br>
GJ. et al., Green Chemistry, 2002, 4, 392-399. Ion exchange resins containing<br>
quaternary ammonium groups may be used as catalyst only when low carbon<br>
number feed is condensed, because the resin cannot be used at high temperatures.<br>
Fatty alcohols may be produced by hydrogenation of either fatty acids or fatty<br>
acid alkyl esters. Three types of hydrogenation units for producing alcohols from<br>
alkyl esters are in commercial use; gas phase hydrogenation trickle-bed<br>
hydrogenation, and suspension hydrogenation. Of these, the first two comprise a fixed bed catalyst. In all processes, a catalyst containing copper chromite is used<br><br>
at a temperature of 200 to 250 °C and under a pressure of 20 to 30 MPa.<br>
Unsaturated fatty alcohols are produced using copper-zinc catalysts containing no<br>
chromium. Moreover, saturated alcohols may also be produced at 200 to 230 °C,<br>
under a pressure of about 20 MPa using a nickel catalyst activated with<br>
chromium, iron, or rhodium.<br>
Fatty aldehydes may be produced from fatty alcohols by removing hydrogen in a<br>
dehydrogenation reaction. The reaction is opposite to the hydrogenation reaction<br>
of alcohols, and thus endothermic. In the dehydrogenation reaction, corresponding<br>
hydrogenation catalysts are used but the temperature is higher, and thus side<br>
reactions such as cracking, isomerization, cyclization, and polymerization are<br>
possible. Supported copper chromite catalysts are typically used for producing<br>
aldehydes from alcohols. In gas phase dehydrogenation, typically temperatures<br>
between 250 and 400 °C, and pressures between 0.1 and 0.5 MPa are used.<br>
Moreover, it is generally known that corresponding aldehydes can be produced<br>
from alcohols using alumina, silica-alumina, hafnium oxide and zirconium oxide<br>
as catalyst. The products of the process are controlled by changing process<br>
temperature. At low temperatures ethers are obtained, high temperatures give<br>
aldehydes, whereas olefins are typically obtained at 300 - 350 °C.<br>
Processes for producing ketones are known in the art where the functional groups<br>
of the feed molecules react with each other forming a ketone. The carbon number<br>
of the ketone formed is reduced by one compared to the sum of the carbon<br>
numbers of the reacted feed molecules. Metals or oxides of alkaline earth metals<br>
are used as catalysts. EP 591297 describes a method for producing a ketone from<br>
fatty acids by pyrolysis reaction using magnesium oxide catalyst. EP 0457665<br>
discloses a method for producing ketones from triglycerides, fatty acids, fatty acid<br>
esters, fatty acid salts, and fatty acid anhydrides using bauxite catalyst containing<br>
iron oxide.<br><br>
Aldehydes and ketones, other than of fatty acid origin, may be prepared from<br>
carbohydrates by acid hydrolysis of biomass. The major constituents of the<br>
biomass, of bemicellulose are pentosans (C5 carbohydrates) and of cellulose are<br>
hexosans (C6 carbohydrates), which when hydrolyzed yield C5 sugars (pentoses)<br>
and C6 sugars (hexosea). The carbonyl groups in sugars are mainly aldehyde and<br>
only a few are ketones. 5-carbon sugars degrade more rapidly than 6-carbon<br>
sugars, and one way to decrease sugar degradation in acid hydrolysis is to have a<br>
two-stage process. The first stage is conducted under mild process conditions to<br>
recover the 5-carbon sugars while the second stage is conducted under harsher<br>
conditions to recover the 6-carbon sugars. Sugars are reacted further in the<br>
presence of a mineral acid catalyst to yield corresponding aldehydes or ketones.<br>
There are two basic types of acid processes: dilute acid and concentrated acid,<br>
again with variations of each process, Dilute acid processes are conducted under<br>
high temperatures of 160 - 300 °C and pressure, and have reaction times in the<br>
range of seconds or minutes, which facilitates continuous processing.<br>
FI 100248 presents a process with two steps wherein middle distillate is produced<br>
from plant oil by hydrogenation of the carboxylic acids ox triglycerides of said<br>
plant oil to yield linear normal paraffins, followed by isomerization of said n-<br>
paraffrns to give branched paraffins. The hydrogenation was performed at a<br>
temperature ranging from 330 to 450 oC, under a pressure of higher than 3 MPa<br>
and the liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) being from 0.5 to 5 1/h, The<br>
isomerization step was carried out at 200 to 500 °C, under elevated pressure, and<br>
. LHSV being from 0.1 to 10 1/h.<br>
EP209997 discloses a process for producing base oils by isomerization of waxy<br>
hydrocarbons derived from crude oil, thus producing only low amounts of light<br>
fractions. This method is used for instance for producing base oils of Group III<br>
from the waxy hydrocracking bottom oils.<br><br>
JP 01 056 792 discloses foodprocessing lubricants comprising squalane, which is<br>
a branched hydrocarbon with molecular formula of C10H62 having highly<br>
branched structure, in combination with high molecular weight polybutene or<br>
polyisobutylene. Document S.T. Gui, P.T. Curnrnings, H.D. Cochran, J.D. Moore,<br>
S.A. Gupta; "Nonequilibrium Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the Rheology of<br>
Linear and Branched Alkanes International Journal of Thermophysics, pages 449-<br>
459, refers to NEMD simulation of the rheology of linear and branched<br>
hydrocarbons. Particularly C10 (n-decane, melting Tm = -30 °C), C16 (n-<br>
hexadecane Tm = IS °C), C24 (n-tetracosane Tm = 52 °C), C25 (10-n-<br>
hexylnonadecane) and C30 squalana were studied. US 4 026 960 discloses a<br>
hydrocarbon compound 2,7,10,15,18,23-hexarnelhyltetracosane, which is useful<br>
as lubricant for precision machines (chronometers) having properties very similar<br>
to squalane.<br>
US 4,317, 948 presents a process for producing lubricating oils from alpha- and<br>
internal olefins by metathesis reaction.<br>
US 2004/230085 relates to the preparation of diesel range hydrocarbons from<br>
biological origin, such as fatty acids or fatty acid esters, which are<br>
hydrodeoxygenated followed by hydroisomerization.<br>
US 3,501,546 discloses a method for preparing waxy paraffins and olefins from<br>
alcohols or aldehydes having up to 24 carbon atoms by using a Pd on titania<br>
catalyst, In said method one carbon of the reacting feed molecules is lost and a<br>
product with limited brandling is obtained.<br><br>
Starting materials from biological sources contain high amounts of oxygen. In<br>
processing oxygen is converted to water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. In<br>
addition, starting materials of biological origin often contain nitrogen, sulfur and<br>
phosphorus known as catalyst poisons and inhibitors of noble metal catalysts.<br>
They cause decreased service life of the catalyst and make frequent regeneration<br>
of the catalysts necessary. In base oil processes, normal paraffins are often<br>
isomerized to obtain branches in the hydrocarbon chain, said branches improving<br>
low temperature properties. Noble metal catalysts are used in isomerization<br>
processes. They are very expensive and highly sensitive to catalyst poisons.<br>
A process utilizing starting materials or intermediates of biological origin,<br>
containing heteroatoms, said starting materials being optionally subjected to<br>
thermal and/or chemical and/or physical and/or mechanical pre-treatment steps,<br>
for producing high-quality base oils is so far not disclosed.<br>
On the basis of the above teachings it may be seen that there is an obvious need<br>
for an alternative process for producing branched saturated hydrocarbon<br>
components preferably from starting materials of biological origin, said process<br>
contributing to avoiding, or at least substantially reducing problems associated<br>
with the solutions of the prior art.<br>
There is also an obvious need for branched, non-polar paraffinic base oils<br>
complying with the quality requirements for high-quality base oils, said base oil<br>
being preferably of biological origin and having more preferable impacts on the<br>
environment and for end users than traditional mineral base oils. In addition, there<br>
is a need for a process based on the use of renewable feedstock, thus saving non-<br>
renewable raw materials.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is a process for producing a hydrocarbon component.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is a process for producing a hydrocarbon<br>
component using starting materials of biological origin.<br>
Another object of the invention is a process for producing base oils.<br>
Still another object of the invention is a process for producing a new type of<br>
branched paraffinic base oils not containing heteroatoms, from starting materials<br>
of biological origin.<br>
An object of the invention is moreover a base oil complying with the requirements<br>
of the API Group III.<br>
The characteristic features of the process and base oils of the invention are<br>
presented in the appended claims.<br>
General description of the invention<br>
The process of the invention comprises a condensation step of aldehydes and<br>
ketones. Preferably of the aldehydes and ketones are derived from fatty acids or<br>
carbohydrates. The reaction in presented in scheme I below, wherein molecules of<br>
the feedstock react with each other, thus increasing the carbon chain length of the<br>
branched component thus obtained. Further, the process of the invention<br>
comprises a hydrodeoxygenation step for removing heteroatoms from the<br>
condensation product, and finally, an isomerization step for making branches to<br>
the molecular structure and thus improving low temperature properties of the<br>
paraffinic product.<br><br>
where, R' = H (aldehyde), or C3 - C23 (ketone);<br>
and R = C2 - C22.<br><br>
Preferably feedstocks originating from starting materials of biological origin are<br>
primarily used. In addition, the process may comprise optional prehydrogenation,<br>
finishing, and product recirculation steps.<br>
The aldol condensation reaction is utilized for increasing the hydrocarbon chain<br>
length of the feed stream to obtain a product being an unsaturated branched<br>
monofunctional carbonyl compound.<br>
Here, carbonyl compound refers to a compound containing carbonyl functionality<br>
of aldehydes or ketones.<br>
Here, fatty acids refer to carboxylic acids of biological origin having a carbon<br>
number higher than C1.<br>
Aldehydes and ketones derived from fatty acids; and fatty aldehydes and fatty<br>
ketones refer here to aldehydes and ketones obtained from fatty acids or<br>
triglycerides of biological origin.<br>
Here, hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) refers to oxygen removal from a compound by<br>
means of hydrogen. Water is liberated in the reaction, and simultaneously olefinic<br>
double bonds are hydrogenated and any sulfur and nitrogen compounds are<br>
removed. Reactions of the HDO step are exothermal. After the HDO step, the<br>
structure of the starting material has become paraffinic.<br>
Here, saturated base oil comprises saturated hydrocarbons. The term "saturated<br>
hydrocarbons" refers to paraffinic and naphthenic compounds, but not to<br>
aromatics. Paraffinic compounds may either be branched or linear. Naphthenic<br>
compounds are cyclic saturated hydrocarbons, or cycloparaffins, typically derived<br>
from cyclopentane or cyclohexane. A naphthenic compound may comprise a<br>
single ring structure (mononaphthene) or two isolated ring structures (isolated<br><br>
dinaphthene), or two fused ring structures (fused dinaphthene) or three or more<br>
fused ring structures (polycyclic naphthenes or polynaphthenes).<br>
In this context, width of the carbon number range refers to the difference of the<br>
carbon numbers of the largest and the smallest molecules, plus one, in the final<br>
product.<br>
In this context, pressures are gauge pressures relative to normal atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
Classification of the Periodic System of the Elements is the IUPAC classification;<br>
Accompanying Figure<br>
The invention is now illustrated with the appended figure 1 without wishing to<br>
limit the scope of the invention to the embodiments of said figure.<br>
In figure 1, the feedstock stream 2 comprising aldehydes and/or ketones derived<br>
from fatty acids or carbohydrates and a hydrogen stream 3 are introduced into a<br>
prehydrogenation reactor 20 for the optional prehydrogenation of double bonds.<br>
In the prehydrogenation reactor 20 may optionally added part of the lighter<br>
product fraction (102) to be recirculated, or another hydrocarbon stream 201 to<br>
dilute the feed. The diluent stream 202 comprises the recirculated stream 102, or<br>
hydrocarbon stream 201, or a mixture thereof. From said prehydrogenation reactor<br>
20, the saturated aldehyde and/or ketone product is passed as the stream 21 to an<br>
aldol condensation reactor 30. Alternatively, other aldehydes 5 such as aldehydes<br>
produced synthetically may be introduced into the process either alone or in<br>
combination with the above aldehydes. The hydroxy carbonyl compound or<br>
preferably alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound obtained as the product <br>
from the aldol condensation reactor 30 is passed as stream 31, whereas hydrogen<br>
is passed as stream 3 to the HDO reactor 40. Alternatively, the components not<br><br>
condensed in the condensation reaction, still present in stream 31, may be<br>
separated for instance by distillation in a distillation unit 60, followed by<br>
recirculation as stream 61 to the aldol condensation reactor 30. The condensed<br>
components are passed as stream 62 to the HDO reactor 40. The branched<br>
paraffinic product from the HDO step is passed as stream 41 to stripping 70 for<br>
removing unwanted impurities. Thereafter, the paraffinic product stream 71 and<br>
hydrogen stream 3 is introduced into the hydroisomerization reactor 80, said<br>
reactor also optionally receiving a diluent 202. Following hydroisomerization 80,<br>
the branched paraffins 81 may be optionally subjected to finishing 90 using a<br>
hydrogen stream 3, followed by passing the product as stream 91 to a distillation<br>
and/or separation unit 100. In said distillation and/or separation unit 100, product<br>
components boiling at different temperature ranges and/or for special<br>
applications; gases 104, gasoline 101, diesel 102, and base oil 103, are separated.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has now been surprisingly found that branched saturated high-quality base oils<br>
are obtained by the process according to the invention, comprising an aldol<br>
condensation reaction of aldehydes and/or ketones containing heteroatoms, a<br>
hydrodeoxygenation reaction, and an isomerization reaction. In the process of the<br>
invention, the aldol condensation reaction of aldehydes and ketones, particularly<br>
of biological origin, may be utilized in combination with hydrodeoxygenation and<br>
the isomerization reactions the production of saturated base oils in a novel way.<br>
In the aldol condensation reaction step the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the<br>
feedstock is increased to such that only carbon-carbon bonds are left in the basic<br>
structure of the molecule. Such aldehyde or ketone molecule is not suitable as<br>
such for base oil and therefore the oxygen present in the carbonyl group must be<br>
removed,and the low temperature properties must be improved for instance by<br>
making short branches to the molecular structure. Moreover, the process may<br><br>
optionally comprise a prehydrogenation step, recirculation and finishing steps of<br>
the product.<br>
In case aldehydes and/or ketones, particularly of biological origin are used as the<br>
feedstock for producing base oils, it is necessary to increase the length of<br>
hydrocarbon chains thereof to obtain molecules having only carbon-carbon bonds<br>
in the basic structure. According to the invention, this is achieved by allowing<br>
aldehydes or ketones react with each other, thus producing carbon-carbon bonds<br>
in the molecule. In the structure of the products of the invention with increased<br>
hydrocarbon chain length, an aldehyde group is attached to a -CH2- group in the<br>
middle of the long main hydrocarbon chain. If ketones are used as feed in the<br>
same condensation reaction, there are four longer hydrocarbon chains and a<br>
ketone group in on of these branches as shown in scheme (I). Also combinations<br>
of the two described reactions are possible. Aldehydes and ketones of the<br>
feedstock may also comprise two or several functional carbonyl groups, thus<br>
obtaining several branching sites in the structure of the product.<br>
In the process of the invention aldehydes with carbon numbers from C1 to C40,<br>
preferably primary saturated aldehydes, and/or ketones with carbon numbers from<br>
C3 to C79, are reacted with each other in the condensation step. By this means the<br>
hydrocarbon chain length of the feedstock may be increased, and it reaches the<br>
carbon number of base oil. Also aldehydes and/or ketones with shorter chains may<br>
be used, thus enabling the increase of the molecular weight of the product by<br>
lower carbon numbers than by typical carbon numbers of fatty aldehydes ranging<br>
from C12 to C24 or typical for ketones ranging from C23 to C47, which enables<br>
the production of lighter compounds that base oil compounds. In a similar<br>
manner, aldehydes and/or ketones with two or more functional carbonyl groups<br>
may be used for lengthening the hydrocarbon chain. Said aldehydes with short<br>
chains and/or with two or more functional groups may be synthetic and/or derived<br>
from natural materials.<br><br>
In the process of the invention, heteroatoms are removed from the product of the<br>
aldol condensation reaction in a hydrodeoxygenation step, thus liberating carbonyl<br>
oxygen in form of water. In addition, any other oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur<br>
compounds are simultaneously removed. Saturated branched hydrocarbons having<br>
branches in the middle of the chain are obtained as the product.<br>
The product (mainly paraffins) obtained in the hydrodeoxygenation step is<br>
subjected to hydroisomerization. In the hydroisomerization the non-branched<br>
hydrocarbon chains of the molecules are isomerized so that they contain some<br>
more short branches, in order to improve low temperature properties. Following<br>
the hydroisomerization step, the oxidation stability of the product may be<br>
improved by an optional finishing treatment. In addition, an optional dewaxing<br>
may be performed prior to or after the finishing.<br>
Branched paraffins with shorter chains of the diesel class are produced as by-<br>
products in the process.<br>
Feedstock<br>
The feedstock of the process comprises at least one aldehyde or ketone selected<br>
from the group consisting of C1-C40 aldehydes, C3-C79 ketones and C2-C40<br>
hydroxy aldehydes, and mixtures thereof. Aldehydes and ketones of both<br>
synthetic and biological origin may be used as feedstock. C4-C24 fatty aldehydes,<br>
C3-C47 ketones and C4-C24 hydroxy aldehydes, preferably of biological origin,<br>
optionally subjected to one or more purification and/or conditioning step(s) of the<br>
prior art are preferably used. Conditioning steps include e.g. hydrolysis to produce<br>
fatty acids, transesterification with an alcohol or acid, esterification for producing<br>
fatty acid alkyl esters, reduction of fatty acids or fatty acid alkyl esters to give<br>
alcohols, as well as reduction of alcohols to give aldehydes, or ketonisation of<br>
fatty acids,or fatty acid alkyl esters to give ketones.<br><br>
The aldehydes and ketones may be produced using any known method in the art.<br>
Aldehydes and ketones are preferably produced from starting materials of<br>
biological origin, derived from plants, animals and fishes, and selected from the<br>
group consisting of plant oils, plant waxes, plant fats, animal oils, animal fats,<br>
animal waxes, fish oils, fish fats and fish waxes. Corresponding starting materials<br>
derived from algae and insects are also contemplated as well as starting materials<br>
derived from aldehydes and ketones prepared from carbohydrates.<br>
The starting material of biological origin is suitably selected from the group<br>
consisting of:<br>
a)	plant fats._plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish<br>
fats, fish oils, fish waves,and<br>
b)	free fatty acids or fatty acids obtained by hydrolysis, acid transesterification or<br>
pyrolysis reactions from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal fats, animal<br>
oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
c)	esters obtained by transesterification from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes,<br>
animal fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
d)	fatty acid alkyl esters obtained by esterifrcation of alcohols with fatty acids of<br>
plant, animal and fish origin, and<br>
e)	alcohols and aldehydes obtained as reduction or hydrogenolysis products of<br>
free fatty acids, or fatty acids from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal<br>
fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
f)	ketones obtained by ketonisation reaction of the free fatty acids, esters,<br>
alcohols or aldehydes obtained from plant fats, plant oils, plant waxes, animal<br>
fats, animal oils, animal waxes, fish fats, fish oils, fish waxes, and<br>
g)	fatty alcohols obtained by hydrolysis, transesterification and pyrolysis from<br>
waxes of biological origin, and<br>
h) waste and recycled food grade fats and oils, and fats, oils and waxes obtained<br>
by genetic engineering, and<br>
i) mixtures of said starting materials.<br><br>
Typical basic structural unit of plant and fish oils and animal fats is a triglyceride.<br>
Triglyceride is an ester of glycerol with three fatty acid molecules having the<br>
structure below:<br><br>
wherein R1 R2 and R3 represent C4-C30 hydrocarbon chains. With respect to the<br>
hydrocarbon chain, said fatty acids are unbranched carboxylic acids with long<br>
chains. Main hydrocarbon chain lengths are 18 carbons (C18). C18 fatty acids are<br>
typically bonded to the middle hydroxyl group of glycerol. Fatty acids linked to<br>
the two other hydroxyl groups typically have even carbon numbers, generally<br>
between carbon numbers C14 and C22.<br>
Fatty acid composition of the starting material of biological origin may<br>
considerably vary among feedstocks from different sources. While several double<br>
bonds may be present in fatty acids, they are non-conjugated, but at least one<br>
intermediate -CH2- unit is between them. With respect to configuration, the<br>
double bonds of natural fatty acids are of cis form, hydrogen atoms being thus<br>
located on the same side of the rather rigid double bond. As the number of the .<br>
double bonds increase, they are generally located at the free end of the chain.<br>
Lengths of hydrocarbon chains and numbers of double bonds depend on the<br>
various plant or animal fats, oils or waxes serving as the source of the fatty acid.<br>
Animal fats typically contain more saturated fatty acids than unsaturated fatty<br>
acids. Fatty acids of fish oil contain high amounts of double bonds, and the<br>
average length of the hydrocarbon chains is higher compared to fatty acids of<br>
plant oils and animal fats.<br><br>
The fatty acid composition of the starting material of biological origin plays an<br>
important role in estimating oxidation resistance, thermal stability, .and low<br>
temperature properties of the feedstock, and also in the determination of the types<br>
of products obtained by the aldol condensation reaction. Unsaturated components<br>
present in the feedstock readily undergo oligomerization, and also form<br>
compounds with ring structures, and following hydrogenation, result in more<br>
oligomeric hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons with ring structures in the final<br>
product.<br>
Waxes are mainly fatty acids esterified with alcohols having long chains.<br>
Moreover, waxes contain various amounts of paraffins (n-alkanes), ketones, and<br>
diketones, primary and secondary alcohols, aldehydes, alkane acids (fatty acids)<br>
and terpenes. Carbon numbers of such fatty acid and alcohol chains are typically<br>
from CI2 to C38.<br>
Examples of suitable biological starting materials include fish oils such as baltic<br>
herring oil, salmon oil, herring oil, tuna oil, anchovy oil, sardine oil, and mackerel<br>
oil; plant oils such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower seed oil,<br>
soybean oil, com oil, hemp oil, olive oil, cottonseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil, peanut oil, castor oil, jatropha seed oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil; and<br>
moreover, suitable are also animal fats such as lard, tallow, and also waste and<br>
recycled food grade fats and oils, as well as fats, waxes and oils produced by<br>
genetic engineering. In addition to fats and oils, suitable starting materials of<br>
biological origin include animal waxes such as bee wax, Chinese wax (insect<br>
wax), shellac wax, and lanoline (wool wax), as well as plant waxes such as<br>
carnauba palm wax, ouricouri palm wax, jojoba seed oil, candelilla wax, esparto<br>
wax, Japan wax and rice bran oil.<br>
biological and synthetic materials, and if necessary, feedstocks produced by other<br>
processes, or synthetically produced feedstocks suitable for the process step in<br><br>
question may be used as additional feedstocks. Also pure synthetic feedstocks are<br>
contemplated, but in this case, the products are not based on renewable natural<br>
resources.<br>
In addition to fatty aldehydes, also synthetic hydroxy aldehydes or hydroxy<br>
aldehydes derived from starting materials of biological origin may be used as<br>
feedstocks in the process of the invention. For the thermal stability of the base oil<br>
to be produced, preferably aldehydes and/or ketones free of tertiary carbon are<br>
used. Particularly for improving low temperature properties and for producing<br>
heavier base oils branched additional components to obtain branching sites in the<br>
structure of the base oils may be used.<br>
Hydrocarbons serving as diluent, for instance hydrocarbons of the diesel class,<br>
preferably of biological origin, may optionally be added to the feedstock in<br>
different process steps. Boiling range of hydrocarbons of the diesel class is from<br>
150 to 400 °C, typically from 180 to 360 °C.<br>
Process<br>
Condensation step<br>
Feedstock comprising at least one component selected from the group consisting<br>
of C1-C40 aldehydes, C3-C79 ketones, C2-C40 hydroxy aldehydes and mixtures<br>
hereof are subjected to condensation reaction. The aldehydes and/or ketones are<br>
condensed to substantially increase the carbon number of the hydrocarbon stream.<br>
Saturated aldehydes and ketones are preferably used as the feedstock. In the<br>
process, the aldol condensation reaction is preferably used, thus obtaining<br>
branched unsaturated aldehydes or ketones. In the condensation homogeneous or<br>
heterogeneous aldol condensation catalysts may be used. Supported alkali metal<br>
catalysts like Na/SiO2 may be mentioned as heterogeneous catalysts. The<br>
homogeneous catalyst is preferably an alkali or an alkaline earth metal hydroxide,<br>
for instance NaOH, KOH or Ca(OH)2. The reaction temperature is from 80 to 400<br>
oC, preferably lower temperature is used with lower molecular weight feeds and<br><br>
higher temperatures with higher molecular weight feed Optionally solvents such<br>
as alcohols may be used. The amount of the homogeneous catalyst to be used in<br>
the reaction varies from 1 to 20 %, preferably from 1.5 to 19 %, by weight.<br>
Alternatively, reaction conditions of the aldol condensation may be adjusted to<br>
yield hydroxy aldehydes such as aldols as the reaction products, thus minimizing<br>
the oligomerization based on the reaction of double bonds. In this case, also the<br>
hydroxyl group has to be removed as water in the next HBO step.<br>
Hydrodeoxygenation step<br>
In the subsequent HDO step heteroatoms of the products obtained in the aldol<br>
condensation reaction are removed. In the HDO step of the process according to<br>
the invention, the product of the aldol condensation and hydrogen gas are reacted<br>
under a pressure ranging between 0.1 and 20 MPa, preferably between 1 and 15<br>
MPa, the temperature being from 100 to 500 °C, preferably from 150 to 350 °C.<br>
In the HDO step, special catalysts containing a metal of the Group VIII and/or<br>
VIA of the periodic system of the elements, and alumina and/or silica may be<br>
used. The HDO catalyst is preferably a supported Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru, Ni, NiMo or<br>
CoMo catalyst, support being activated carbon, alumina and/or silica.<br>
In a preferable embodiment, the reaction product obtained after the HDO step is<br>
purified for instance by stripping with steam, or with a suitable gas such as a light<br>
hydrocarbons, nitrogen or hydrogen. It is preferable for the process to remove<br>
impurities and water as efficiently as possible prior to the hydro isomerization<br>
step and/or finishing step.<br>
Hydroisomerization step<br>
After the HDO and the optional purification steps, hydroisomerization is carried<br>
out by reacting hydrogen gas, the hydrogenated components, and optional<br>
paraffinic additional food,in the presence of an isomerization catalyst.In the <br>
hydroisomerization step, the pressure ranges from 0.1 to 20 MPa, preferably from<br>
1 to 15 MPa. The temperature ranges between 100 and 500 °C, preferably<br><br>
between 200 and 400 °C. In the hydroisomerization step, special catalysts<br>
containing molecular sieves and metals of the Group VIII of the periodic system<br>
of the elements, for instance Ni, Pt, and Pd, may be used. Alumina and/or silica<br>
may be used as supports.<br>
Prehydrogenation step<br>
The feedstock, as well as the product from the aldol condensation reaction may be<br>
subjected to an optional prehydrogenation step under mild conditions to<br>
hydrogenate possible double bonds and to reduce coke formation in the next<br>
process step since catalytic activity is mainly lost due to coal formation on the<br>
surface thereof. The prehydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a<br>
hydrogenation catalyst at temperatures between 50 and 400 °C, under a hydrogen<br>
pressure ranging from 0.1 to 20 MPa, preferably at temperatures between 150 and<br>
300 °C, under a hydrogen pressure ranging from 1 to 10 MPa. The<br>
prehydrogenation catalyst contains metals of the Group VIII and/or VIA of the<br>
periodic system of the elements. The prehydrogenation catalyst is preferably a<br>
supported Pd, Pt, Ni, Ru, Rh, Cu, CuCr, NiMo or CoMo catalyst, the support<br>
being either activated carbon, alumina and/or silica.<br>
Dewaxing step<br>
Following the hydroisomerization step, optional dewaxing step may be performed<br>
either catalytically or as solvent-based dewaxing. In the catalytic dewaxing,<br>
hydrogen gas and the component to be isomerized, as well as optional paraffinic<br>
additional feed react in the presence of a dewaxing catalyst. Zeolite catalysts<br>
comprising metals of the Group VIII of the periodic system of the elements such<br>
as Ni, Pt or Pd are used. In the dewaxing step, the pressure varies from 0.1 to 20<br>
MPa, the temperature being between 100 and 500 °C.<br>
In the solvent-based dewaxing, paraffinic waxes are separated by dissolving the<br>
oil in a mixture of solvents, for instance methylethyl ketone and toluene. In the<br>
process, the solvent and the feed are passed counter current and thus mixed. The<br><br>
mixture of oil (isomerized product) and solvent is introduced to a cooling unit.<br>
Cooling results in crystallization of the paraffinic waxes. The cooling temperature<br>
depends on the desired low temperature properties of the product. Wax crystals<br>
are filtered from the mixture, collected for further processing, and the solvent is<br>
separated by evaporation from the base oil.<br>
Finishing step<br>
The product obtained above may optionally be finished for removing any double<br>
bonds and aromatics. In case said finishing is performed using hydrogen in the<br>
presence of a catalyst, it is called hydrofinishing, the pressure thus ranging from 1<br>
to 20 MPa, preferably from 2 to 15 MPa, and the temperature ranges between 50<br>
and 500 °C, preferably between 200 and 400 °C. In the hydrofinishing, special<br>
catalysts containing metals of the Group VIII of the periodic system of the<br>
elements, and alumina and/or silica may be used. The hydrofinishing catalyst is<br>
preferably a supported Pd, Pt, or Ni catalyst, the support being alumina and/or<br>
silica. Finishing may also be achieved by removing polar components using<br>
adsorption materials, such as clay or molecular sieves.<br>
Following the optional finishing, the product is passed to a distillation and/or<br>
separation unit for separating product components boiling over different<br>
temperature ranges and/or intended for different applications,<br>
If desired, the hydrocarbon component obtained as the product, or another suitable<br>
hydrocarbon may be used as diluent in various stages of the process of the<br>
invention, such as in the aldol condensation, HDO and/or isomerization steps for<br>
increasing the conversion and/or selectivity and/or for controlling the exothermal<br>
nature of the reactions.<br>
A fixed catalyst bed reactor,for instance the trickle bed reactor of the prior art is<br>
preferably used in prehydrogenation, HDO, hydroisomerization, and<br>
hydrofinishing steps.<br><br>
Product<br>
The process according to the invention yields a high quality branched and<br>
saturated hydrocarbon component suitable as base oil. The base oil product has<br>
excellent viscosity and low temperature properties. The process according to the<br>
invention also yields as by-product paraffinic hydrocarbon product suitable for<br>
diesel fuel pool. The diesel component contains typically some short carbon-<br>
carbon side branches, resulting in an exceptionally low cloud point and cold filter<br>
plugging point but still a good cetane number. In addition, a hydrocarbon<br>
component suitable as a solvent, gasoline and/or a component of gasoline is<br>
obtained as by-product. All these products are preferably of biological origin.<br>
Feedstocks, and preferably feedstocks derived from biological starting materials<br>
have a substantial effect on the composition and distillation range of the product.<br>
Components of feedstocks derived from fatty acids may be fractionated by<br>
distillation to give fractions having narrow carbon number ranges to be tailored<br>
according to requirements of various applications. For feedstocks having<br>
hydrocarbon chains of CI6, CI8, C20 and C22, typical carbon numbers of the<br>
products are respectively C32, C36, C40, and C44. Product fractions having<br>
narrow carbon number ranges and distillation ranges are obtained since the<br>
distillation range of the product mainly depends on the length of the hydrocarbon<br>
chain of the feedstock. Base oils with narrow distillation ranges obtained<br>
according to the invention have extremely low volatilities when compared to<br>
corresponding products of the prior art.<br>
Carbon number ranges of the base oils of the invention are extremely narrow,<br>
typically no more than 5 carbons wide for C12/C14, C14/C16 and C16/C18<br>
feedstocks. Most typical structures and carbon number ranges of the base oils<br>
produced by the TQCSSS of the invention (with kinematic- viscosity of 4-6 cSt/100<br>
°C) are presented in Table 2. The carbon number is governed by the carbon<br>
number of the feedstock. Most typical carbon numbers are shown bold-faced.<br><br>
Typical structures and carbon number ranges (C25-C35) of synthetic<br>
hydro isomerized hydrocarbon base oils VHVI, GTL and Slack Wax base oils of<br>
the prior art, derived from mineral oils, and belonging to the same viscosity class<br>
(about 4 to 6 cSt/100 °C), are also presented in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Base oils shown in Table 2 are produced as follows:<br>
1.	Base oil of the invention is obtained by aldol condensation, hydrogenation and<br>
hydroisomerization of feed comprising C18 aldehyde.<br>
2.	Base oil of the invention is obtained by aldol condensation, hydrogenation and<br>
hydroisomerization of feed comprising C23 ketone and C5 aldehydes.<br>
3.	Base oil of the invention is obtained by aldol condensation, hydrogenation and<br>
hydroisomerization of feed comprising C23 ketone.<br>
4.	GTL is an isomerization product of the Fischer-Tropsch waxy fraction.<br>
5.	SW is an isomerization product of the Slack Wax waxy fraction, derived from<br>
mineral oil. <br>
6.	VHVI is a hydrocracked and isomerized base oil derived from mineral oil.<br>
Saturated hydrocarbons are classified according to the carbon and hydrogen atoms<br>
by field ionization mass spectrometry (FIMS) method as follows:<br>
1	C(n).H(2n+2)	paraffins<br>
2	C(n).H(2n)	mononaphthenes<br>
3	C(n).H(2n-2)	dinaphthenes<br><br>
4	C(n).H(2n-4)	trinaphthenes<br>
5	C(n).H(2n-6)	tetranaphthenes<br>
6	C(n).H(2n-8)	pentanaphthenes<br>
In Table 2, the percentages (%, by FIMS) refer to the groups of compounds<br>
determined according to said method.<br>
Using feedstocks with different hydrocarbon chains lengths and the aldol<br>
condensation reaction, molecular masses of the products may be increased to<br>
reach viscosity ranges required for different applications. In the condensation<br>
reaction the length of the hydrocarbon chain of the feedstock is increased. It is<br>
thus possible to produce lighter hydrocarbon products such as solvents, gasoline,<br>
and diesel fuels from feedstocks with shorter chains, and base oils from<br>
feedstocks with longer chains.<br>
With respect to molecular structure, base oils of the invention differ from products<br>
of the prior art as may be seen from Table 2. The product obtained by the process<br>
according to the invention using aldehydes as feed compounds comprises a<br>
methyl-branch in the middle of the main hydrocarbon chain (structure 1 in Table<br>
2). The product differs from the GTL and SW isomerization products of the prior<br>
art (structures 4 and 5 in Table 2) typically having branches only at the ends of the<br>
chains. If aldehydes and ketones are used as feed compounds, the product<br>
obtained with the process of the invention has remarkably longer side chains<br>
compared to products of the prior art (structures 4 and 5 in Table 2). And finally,<br>
if ketones are used as feed compounds, the product obtained with the process of<br>
the invention has even longer side chains compared to products of the prior art<br>
(structures 4 and 5 in Table 2).<br>
Branches located in the middle of the hydrocarbon chain lower the pour point<br>
considerably more than those at the ends of the chain. In addition to the location<br>
of the branches, the number thereof affects the pour point, it being lowered by<br><br>
increasing branching, but at the same time also the viscosity index is reduced.<br>
Accordingly, being favourable for both the pour point and the viscosity index, the<br>
number of the branches should be limited. The product obtained by isomerization<br>
of the paraffinic wax from the aldol condensation reaction (structures 1-3 in Table<br>
2) has methyl branches at the ends of the hydrocarbon component, and to a lesser<br>
extent ethyl branches within the hydrocarbon chain, and in addition a branch or<br>
branches in the middle of the main hydrocarbon chain.<br>
There exists an optimum correlation between the viscosity index and pour point<br>
with the main hydrocarbon chain comprising only a few branches. Accordingly, to<br>
improve the pour point, the paraffin with some branches requires less<br>
isomerization in the process of the invention after the HDO step in comparison to<br>
paraffinic waxes completely free of branches of the prior art. Typically the<br>
products of the invention comprise relatively high proportions of isornerized<br>
molecules containing more than 30 carbon atoms. Such branched high molecular<br>
weight compounds typically also exhibit high viscosity indices (VI) even though<br>
pour point is below - 20 °C.<br>
The base oil according to the invention comprises branched hydrocarbons having<br>
carbon number at least C18, and it comprises at least 90 %, preferably at least 95<br>
%, and particularly preferably at least 97 % by weight of saturated hydrocarbons<br>
(GC). Preferably the base is of biological origin and produced from starting<br>
materials of biological origin. It comprises not more than 15 % by weight,<br>
preferably not more than 10 % by weight and particularly preferably not more<br>
than 5 % by weight of mononaphthenes (FIMS). It comprises not more than 1 %<br>
by weight, preferably not more than 0.5 % by weight and particularly preferably<br>
0.1 % by weight of fused dinaphthenes and polynaphthenes (FIMS).<br>
For base oils according to invention the viscosity index is more than 120,<br>
preferably at least 130 and particularly preferably at least 140 (ASTM D 2270)<br><br>
and pour point is lower than -9 °C, preferably lower than -12 °C and particularly<br>
preferably lower than -15 °C (ASTM D 5950).<br>
Width of the carbon number range of base oils of the invention is no more than 5<br>
carbons, preferably no more than 3 carbons, and particularly preferably no more<br>
than 1 carbon (FIMS). At least 60 % by weight of the saturated hydrocarbons are<br>
within the specified carbon number range (of no more than 5, etc.) preferably at<br>
least 75 % by weight and particularly preferably at least 90 % by weight.<br>
Distillation range of base oils of the invention is no more than 150 °C, preferably<br>
no more than 100 °C, particularly preferably no more than 70 °C (determined by<br>
the method of ASTM D 2887, distillation points D10 and D90).<br>
Sulfur content of base oils of the invention is less than 300 ppm, preferably less<br>
than 50 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm (ASTM D 3120).<br>
Nitrogen content of base oils of the invention is less than 100 ppm, preferably less<br>
than 10 ppm, and particularly preferably less than 1 ppm (ASTM D 4629).<br>
For the base oil or base oil component, the volatility of product, having KV100<br>
from 3 cSt to 8 cSt, is no more than 2271.2*(KV100)"35373 % by weight as<br>
determined by the method of DIN 51581-2 (Mathematical Noack method based<br>
on ASTM D 2887 GC distillation).<br>
Base oils of the invention, based on biological starting materials, contain carbon<br>
14C isotope, which may be considered as an indication of the use of renewable raw<br>
materials. Typical 14C isotope content (proportion) of the total carbon content in<br>
the product, which is completely of biological origin, is at least 100 %. Carbon<br>
14C isotope content is determined on the basis of radioactive carbon (carbon 14C<br>
isotope) content in the atmosphere in 1950 (ASTM D 6866). 14C isotope content<br>
of the base oil according to the invention is lower in cases where other<br><br>
components besides biological components are used in the processing of the<br>
product, said content being, however, more than 50 %, preferably more than 90<br>
%, particularly preferably more than 99 %. In this way, even low amounts of base<br>
oil of biological origin may be detected in other types of hydrocarbon base oils.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The process of the invention particularly allows for the use of renewable starting<br>
materials of biological origin, containing heteroatoms, for producing base oils<br>
derived from renewable natural resources, but also diesel and gasoline<br>
components as by-products. In addition to traditional crude oil, a completely new<br>
raw material source for high-quality branched parafrinic base oils is provided<br>
according to the invention. Also carbon dioxide emissions contributing to the<br>
greenhouse effect may be reduced by using renewable raw material sources<br>
instead of non-renewable ones.<br>
According to the invention, a base oil only containing carbon and hydrogen is<br>
obtained, the stability of said base oil in humid conditions being higher than that<br>
of base oils containing esters or other heteroatoms. A. paraffinic hydrocarbon<br>
component is not decomposed as easily as esters that form corrosive acids. A non-<br>
polar and fully saturated branched hydrocarbon component, free of sulfur is<br>
obtained using the process of the invention. Oxygen and heteroatoms of any<br>
impurities of the feedstock are removed in the HDO step.<br>
In the isomerization step, the carbon chain is branched, thus improving low<br>
temperature properties, that is, the pour point is lowered and filterability at low<br>
temperatures is improved. Wax is converted to oily hydrocarbon having a<br>
viscosity index (viscosity-temperature-dependence) very suitable for base oil<br>
without any blending limitations, and further it is fully compatible with lubricant<br>
additives.<br><br>
High hydrogen partial pressure and low levels of impurities may be maintained<br>
throughout the whole process. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water<br>
contents may thus be lowered to the extent that light stripping in the HDO stage or<br>
in a separate gas/liquid separation vessel is sufficient to remove residual<br>
impurities prior to isomerization. By means of the optional prehydrogenation step,<br>
yield may be improved and side reactions e.g. polymerization, ring formation, and<br>
aromatization of the double bonds of hydrocarbon chains resulting in coke<br>
formation on the catalyst surface, and reduction of the operation time may be<br>
reduced. Also the viscosity properties of the base oils are changed by ring<br>
formation and polymerization.<br>
With the process of the invention, high-quality saturated base oils having low<br>
pour points may be produced, said base oil being thus very useful at low<br>
temperature conditions. The product is typically free of sulfur, the viscosity index<br>
thereof being preferably at least 120, and thus it may also be suitably used in<br>
applications of Group III base oils.<br>
Fatty aldehydes and ketones derived from fatty acids, which are distilled to<br>
fractions according to carbon numbers may be used as feedstocks. According to<br>
the invention branched paraffinic base oils having narrow boiling ranges and<br>
various physical properties may be processed from these fractions. Typical carbon<br>
number ranges of the product components are as follows: gas C1-C4, gasoline C5-<br>
C10, diesel C11-C26, base oil at least C18. Distillation range of base oils<br>
produced from a feedstock having a single carbon number is narrow.<br>
Narrow distillation range indicates that the product does not contain any initial<br>
light fraction (meaning molecules considerably lighter than the average), seen as<br>
decreased volatility of the product and resulting in reduced emissions and reduced<br>
use of lubricants in practical application.Neither any "tail" composed of the<br>
heavier components (meaning molecules considerably heavier than the average),<br><br>
are contained in the product, resulting in excellent low temperature properties of<br>
the product.<br>
For the base oil of the invention, the carbon number and distillation range are<br>
governed by the feedstock composition. For base oils of the prior art, the<br>
distillation range is adjusted by distilling the product to obtain a fraction having<br>
the desired kinematic viscosity. It is preferable for the lubricants to have base oils<br>
with narrow carbon number ranges and thus narrow distillation ranges. Therefore,<br>
the compositions of base oils according to the invention contain molecules of<br>
similar sizes behaving in a similar way under different conditions..<br>
The base oil according to the invention has high viscosity index, which leads to a<br>
significantly decreased need of high price Viscosity Index Improver (VII) or in<br>
other terms Viscosity Modifier (VM). It is commonly known, that the VII is an<br>
additive, which causes highest amount of deposits in vehicle engines. In addition,<br>
reduction of the amounts of VII results in significant savings in costs.<br>
Also, because the base oil is non-toxic, contains no sulfur, nitrogen or aromatic<br>
compounds typically present in the conventional mineral oil based products, it<br>
may more safely be used in applications where the end user is exposed to oil or oil<br>
spray.<br>
Moreover, response of the base oil according to the invention is extremely high<br>
for antioxidants and pour point depressants, and thus the life time of the<br>
lubricating oils are longer and they can be used in the colder environment than<br>
lubricants based on the conventional base oils.<br>
The base oil of the invention is also chemically more stable than products based<br>
on more reactive esters, and the oxidation resistance thereof is better than that of<br>
base oils based on fatty acids or fatty alcohol dimers, or base oils based on esters,<br>
produced from unsaturated fatty acids of biological origin.<br><br>
Compared to esters, the base oil of the invention is more compatible with<br>
conventional base oils derived from crude oil, base oils obtained from Fischer-<br>
Tropsch process, and with hydrocarbon base oils, as well with lubricant additives.<br>
Moreover, it is compatible with elastomers, and thus it can be used in modern<br>
vehicle engines without modifications.<br>
An additional advantage of the base oil according to this invention is that it fulfils<br>
the API group HI base oil specifications. Therefore it can be used in engine oil<br>
formulations like other group III base oils according the same interchanging rules<br>
without need to perform new engine tests.<br>
The base oil of the invention is preferably based on renewable natural resources.<br>
Starting materials of the process of the invention are available all over the world,<br>
and moreover, the utilization of the process is not limited by significant initial<br>
investments in contrast for instance to the GTL technology.<br>
The products of the inventive process are carbon dioxide neutral with respect to<br>
the use and disposal thereof, that is, they will not increase the carbon dioxide load<br>
of the atmosphere in contrast to products derived from fossil starting materials.<br>
At least one methyl branch is found in the middle of the main hydrocarbon chain<br>
in the hydrocarbon component produced by the process of the invention. Such<br>
C11-C26 hydrocarbons with at least one methyl branch of the diesel class,<br>
produced from C5-C13 feedstocks, have superior low temperature properties, that<br>
is, they are liquid even at low temperatures, the cloud point being low. In contrast,<br>
for heavier C26-C40 hydrocarbon components and for base oil applications, more<br>
than one branch is necessary, said branches being obtained mainly by<br>
hydro isomer ization.<br><br>
The properties of the hydrocarbon components produced with the process<br>
according to the invention are excellent. The products are well suited as base oils<br>
without blending limitations, and further, the products are also compatible with<br>
lubricant additives.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention is now illustrated in more detail with the following examples. It is<br>
however clear that the invention is not limited to embodiments described in the<br>
examples. The invention may also be carried out in other ways without departing<br>
from the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from C16 aldehyde<br>
In aldol condensation reaction 200 g of C16 fatty aldehyde derived from palm oil<br>
and 100 g of 20 % NaOH dissolved in water were put in a Parr reactor. Mixing<br>
was adjusted to 250 rpm, temperature to 250 °C and pressure to 0.5 MPa. Slight<br>
nitrogen purge was maintained to sweep out water liberated in reaction. Reaction<br>
was carried out until the amount of condensed aldehyde was stabilised in GC<br>
analysis. After the reaction the product was neutralized with hydrochloric acid,<br>
washed with water and dried with calcium chloride.<br>
In the next HDO step, the condensed aldehyde obtained above was hydrogenated<br>
in a high pressure Parr reactor using a dried and activated NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, to<br>
give a methyl branched paraffin. The aldehyde was hydrogenated at 340 °C, under<br>
a pressure of 5 MPa, mixing at 300 rpm until no aldehyde peak was detected in<br>
the FTIR spectrum. The pour point of the obtained methyl branched C32 paraffin<br>
wax was 69 oC.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from C23 ketone and furfural<br>
In the aldol condensation step 14.6 g laurone (C23 ketone derived from palm<br>
kernel oil), 150 ml isopropanol and 15 ml of 10 % NaOH in water was mixed and<br>
refluxed 20 min in a round bottom flask at 80 °C. 15 g of furfural (aldehyde<br>
derived from aldohexose sugar) was added and heating under reflux was<br>
continued for 5 hours. After cooling, alcohol was evaporated in a rotary<br>
evaporator. Reaction was repeated and residues from two syntheses were<br>
dissolved in ethyl acetate, cooled in ice and the unreacted laurone was filtrated<br>
from cold solution.<br>
In the next HDO step, the condensation product obtained above was hydrogenated<br>
in a high pressure Parr reactor using a dried and activated NiM0/Al2O3 catalyst, to<br>
give a methyl branched paraffin. The aldehyde was hydrogenated at 320 °C, under<br>
a pressure of 5 MPa, mixing at 300 rpm for 5 hours. The pour point of the<br>
obtained pentyl branched wax was 11 °C.<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a hydrocarbon component from ketones derived from plant oil<br>
In the aldol condensation step 10 g of C31/C33/C35 ketone mixture derived from<br>
palm oil fatty acids and 2 g of NaOH were heated in a round bottom flask to 400<br>
°C for 30 min under mixing. After cooling the synthesis product was dissolved in .<br>
50 ml of ethyl acetate, filtrated and the diluent was evaporated.<br>
In the next HDO step, the condensation product obtained above was hydrogenated<br>
as in Example 2. The pour point of branched wax was 35 °C.<br>
Example 4<br>
Hydroisomerization<br><br>
The C32 paraffin wax obtained in Example 1 was isomerized in a Parr reactor to<br>
give a branched paraffin of the base oil class using a reduced Pt molecular<br>
sieve/Al0O3 catalyst. Preheated paraffin was isomerized under a hydrogen<br>
pressure of 3 MPa and at 340 °C until a pour point under - 15 °C was obtained.<br>
Finally, light fractions were distilled from the product at reduced pressure.<br>
