				<td>SLIDING ELEMENT, COMPRISING AN ANTI REMOVAL DEVICE, WHICH IS<br>
SUSPENDED, AND GUDIED ON A RUNNING TRACK BY MEANS OF ROLLER<br>
CARRIERS<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a sliding element, comprising an anti removal device, which is<br>
suspended, and guided on a running track by means of roller carriers, more<br>
particularly the sliding element guided by means of rollers or gliding elements<br>
suspended on the top surface of a guide rail - whereby the guide rail is connected to<br>
the guide rail clamps on a supporting structure or such like, which secure the guide rail<br>
at the bottom - with an anti-dislodging device provided at the bottom surface of the<br>
guide rail on the sliding element or an attachments of the same.<br>
As a rule, a free space, which is meant to facilitate the dislodging of the entire sliding<br>
element, including the rollers from the guide rail, exists between the sliding element<br>
and the bottom surface of the guide rail. During the normal operation, this free space<br>
can lead to an unintentional dislodging of the sliding element. In order to avoid this,<br>
anti-dislodging devices whose outer periphery facing the guide rail is only marginally<br>
distanced from the outer periphery of the guide rail, are provided on the sliding<br>
element or attachments of the same, so that the sliding element can be dislodged only<br>
after the removal of the anti-dislodging device. In such type of anti-dislodging devices,<br>
one faces problems during the overrunning of the guide rail clamps that support the<br>
guide rail - if they secure the guide rail at the bottom.<br><br>
USP 4 905 345 discloses a sliding element, which is guided by suspending on a guide<br>
rail, via brackets provided between the sliding element and the rollers. The guide rail is<br>
mounted in a U shaped supporting profile, which is open at the top and, like the<br>
supporting profile, consists of many sections. The sections of the supporting profile are<br>
supported in the joining region with angular clamps, whose horizontal side secures the<br>
bottom surface of the supporting profile. An anti-dislodging device for preventing<br>
unintentional dislodging of the sliding element is not provided.<br>
In known sliding elements suspended on brackets, anti-dislodging devices are<br>
provided, which are connected rigidly with the bracket, and with a part of their outer<br>
periphery, encompass or secure at the bottom with play, the outer periphery of the<br>
guide rail. In this regard, on the one hand an overrunning over of the guide rail clamp<br>
and on the other hand, a protection against dislodging must be ensured with the play<br>
required.<br>
The task of the invention is to suggest a solution, by means of which the anti-<br>
dislodging device, with marginal play - if required with no play whatsoever - in the<br>
moving of the sliding element, secures at the bottom, the guide rail as well as, while<br>
moving over of a guide rail clamp, the guide rail or the guide rail clamp, in such a way<br>
that the sliding element is locked against dislodging.<br>
According to this, the anti-dislodging device has a locking element, which is elastically<br>
adjustable against the guide rail and deflects while overrunning a guide rail clamp. As<br>
per the invention, the solution guarantees that the locking element is constantly in<br>
contact with the guide rail or with marginal play, operates on the guide rail, in such a<br>
way that a dislodging of the sliding element from the guide rail is not possible. On the<br><br>
other hand, because of the elastic adjustability of the locking element against the guide<br>
rail, there is the possibility that the locking element recedes if the guide rail clamp<br>
overruns, simultaneously the feature of protection against dislodging is still<br>
guaranteed.<br>
According to a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the anti-<br>
dislodging device has a locking element, which projects from the clamp of the anti-<br>
dislodging device towards the guide rail, is spring-loaded, is adjustable against the<br>
guide rail and protects the sliding element against dislodging. While overrunning a<br>
guide rail seating, the aforesaid locking element deflects against the spring force in the<br>
clamp of the anti-dislodging device, by canceling the locking action of the locking<br>
element. For example, the locking element mounted in a pocket- shaped seating of the<br>
clamp of the anti-dislodging device is, as per the above mentioned features, located in<br>
the clamp in such a manner that during the sliding of the locking element along the<br>
guide rail, the locking element is locked against pushing back into the clamp, so that<br>
the protection against dislodging is guaranteed. On the other hand, while overrunning<br>
one of the guide rail clamps which secures the guide rail at the bottom, the locking<br>
element deflects in such a way against the force of a spring, by pushing into the clamp<br>
of the anti-dislodging device to the extent that the part of the guide rail clamp securing<br>
the guide rail at the bottom can be under-crossed, whereby the protection against<br>
dislodging is maintained. The anti-dislodging device can be in constant contact with<br>
the guide rail and the guide rail clamps.<br>
The locking element is advantageously mounted orthogonal to the direction of<br>
movement of the sliding element, swivelling about an axis moving in the direction of<br><br>
movement of the sliding element, in a pocket of the clamp of the anti-dislodging<br>
device, whereby the swivelling path of the locking element is limited to both swivelling<br>
directions by the seating surfaces of the locking element.<br>
The limiting of the swivelling path of the locking element during the overrunning of the<br>
guide rail in the position, which secures the sliding element against dislodging, is such<br>
that a catch of the locking element is located on the side - facing the supporting<br>
structure - of the guide rail outside the central longitudinal axis of the guide rail and<br>
adjacent to the outer periphery of the guide rail. On the other hand, the swivelling path<br>
of the locking element in the opposite direction is limited during the overrunning of a<br>
guide rail clamp, to such an extent that the catch of the locking element rests against<br>
the guide rail clamp, by leaving a sufficient play of the swivelling path.<br>
With the above-mentioned measures, in a sliding element of the type mentioned at the<br>
beginning, an anti-dislodging device is produced, which has a locking element that can<br>
be elastically reset. The reset facility of this locking element in the clamp of the anti-<br>
dislodging device is locked during the overrunning of the guide rail. The reset facility is<br>
released only on the overrunning of a guide rail clamp.<br>
The spring-loaded mounting of the locking element in the clamp of the anti-dislodging<br>
device is carried out preferably in such a manner that the clamp of the anti-dislodging<br>
device and the locking element have aligned bores, so that the locking element can be<br>
mounted in such a manner that it can swivel, by means of a pin passing through these<br>
aligned bores.<br><br>
In order to facilitate a smooth and quiet overrunning of the guide rail clamp by the<br>
locking element, angular stops are provided on the surface of the locking element<br>
facing the guide rail and/or the guide rail clamp, over which simultaneously the<br>
swivelling movement of the locking element against the clamp is initiated.<br>
Basically, the anti-dislodging device can be fastened to a bracket supporting the sliding<br>
element in any manner; however, it can be carried out advantageously by means of<br>
plug-in dowel pins provided on the anti-dislodging device, a dovetail joint or such like.<br>
The invention is illustrated below with the accompanying drawings, in detail by way of<br>
a possible embodiment.<br>
They show:<br>

Figure 7 &amp; 9:  Two views of the anti-dislodging devices with different attachment<br>
options to a bracket.<br><br>
In Figure 1 a glass panel is labeled as 1, which in the embodiment consists of two<br>
sliding elements 2 guided on a guide rail 5, which can be slided in the direction of<br>
arrow L. The sliding elements 2 are guided via brackets 3 and rollers 4 on the top<br>
surface 6 of the guide rail 5. The guide rail 5 is mounted by means of guide rail clamps<br>
7 on a supporting structure 10 (see Figure 2 and 3).<br>
As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the brackets 3 are connected via spot retainers 8 on the<br>
sliding element. In the embodiment, a cover 9 which rests against the bracket 3, is<br>
provided between the bracket 3 and the sliding element 2. An anti-dislodging device 11<br>
is connected to the bracket 3 or cover 9 by means of a screwed joint 29. A box-shaped<br>
recess is made - not shown precisely in the drawing - on the top surface of that part of<br>
the anti-dislodging device 11, which is identified as clamp 13, so that a locking element<br>
12 can be mounted in this box-shaped recess. The locking element 12 is pre-<br>
tensioned in the direction of arrow B by means of a spring 14 shown in Figure 5 and<br>
during the overrunning of the guide rail 5, takes the position shown in Figure 2.<br>
Thereby, the catch 20 - which is adjacent to or resting against the outer periphery 22<br>
of the guide rail 5 - of the locking element 12, is located at a distance, labelled as x,<br>
from the central longitudinal axis 21 of the guide rail 5 and locks the sliding element 2<br>
against dislodging. A swivelling path of the locking element 12, which is identified by<br>
the direction of arrow B, is stopped at this position so that the locking element 12<br>
cannot swivel further about its axis 17.<br>
While overrunning the guide rail clamp 7, the locking element 12 deflects, by swivelling<br>
about the axis 17 in a yet to be explained manner, in the direction of arrow C and can<br>
thus undercross that part of the guide rail clamp 7, which secures the guide rail 5 at<br><br>
the bottom, whereby at this point the catch 20 rests on that part of the guide rail clamp<br>
7, which secures the guide rail at the bottom. The swivelling path in the direction of<br>
arrow C is so designed such that a sufficient pushing of the locking element 12 into the<br>
pocket (not shown) of the clamp 13 is possible.<br>
Figures 4 to 7 illustrate that the surface 25 of the locking element 12, which faces the<br>
guide rail 5 or the guide rail clamp 7, is provided with angular stops 26, which facilitate<br>
the swivelling action of the locking element 12 from the position shown in Figure 2, to<br>
the position shown in Figure 3, and a smooth overrunning of the guide rail clamp 7.<br>
The side view of the locking element 12 as per Figure 5 shows the mounting of a<br>
spring 14, whose leg 15 rests on the bottom of the pocket (not shown) of the clamp 13<br>
and its leg 16 rests on the locking element. The through bore 24 in the locking element<br>
12 is in alignment with corresponding bores 23 in the clamp 13, so that a pin, not<br>
shown, can be inserted through the bores 23 and 24. Further, figure 5 shows that the<br>
locking element 12 has seating surfaces 18 and 19, wherein the seating surface 19<br>
together with a seating surface (not shown) of the pocket (not shown) of the clamp 13,<br>
forms the swivelling limit in the position shown in Figure 2, while the seating surface 18<br>
forms the final swivelling limit in the position shown in Figure 3.<br>
The representation according to Figure 6 shows the locking element as seen from the<br>
supporting structure (direction of arrow A); the representation according to Figure 7 a<br>
top view of Figure 6.<br><br>
In the embodiment as per Figure 8, the clamp 13 of the anti-dislodging device 11, has<br>
dowel pins 27 which can be plugged-in in corresponding recesses of the bracket 3; in<br>
the embodiment as per Figure 9, the mounting is designed as dovetail joint 28.<br>
