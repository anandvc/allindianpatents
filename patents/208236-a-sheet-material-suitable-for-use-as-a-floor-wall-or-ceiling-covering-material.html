This invention relates to sheet materials suitable for use as floor, wall or ceiling coverings, and processes and intermediates for making the same. The present invention particularly relates to floor wall or ceiling coverings made of one or more non-polyvinyl chloride (non-PVC) polymeric layers.<br>
Materials for floor, wall and ceiling coverings should possess a wide variety of properties which are sometimes not compatible. An important property of materials for floor, wall and ceiling coverings is a good conformability to uneven or contoured surfaces to allow efficient application of the material to floors and walls. Particularly important for materials used for floor coverings are good wear, abrasion, scratch and indentation resistance and good indentation recovery to reduce visible scratches and indentations of furniture and rolling objects, such as office chairs.<br>
Well known floor coverings are based on polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC-based materials have many desirable properties, such as good filler acceptance, flexibility and scratch resistance. However, in more recent years attention has focused on the disadvantages of PVC-based flooring.<br>
Typical PVC covering construction includes a PVC-plastisol based covering. The plastisol typically consists of PVC particles, plasticizer. heavy metal additives and inorganic filler. The covering layer is formed in a spreading process by laying-down the plastisol on a fabric or release paper substrate and subsequently curing the plastisol. The PVC covering layer is typically manufactured using a calendering or roll mill process. In such processes, rigid PVC requires plasticizers and heavy metal stabilizers. Plasticizers have a tendency to migrate, which results in a gradual deterioration in resiliency and build up of a sticky residue that can lead to dirt accumulation, and the plasticizers can form pathways in the polymer for dye migration which can render printed patterns less distinct. The hydrogen chloride and heavy metal ash from decomposition of the heavy metal<br>
stabilizers are undesired consequences from the incineration of scrap associated with manufacturing and installation of PVC-based covering materials.<br><br>
One aspect of this invention is sheet material suitable for use as a floor, wall or ceiling covering material comprising<br>
1)	a polymer mixture having:<br>
(A)	at least one homogeneously branched ethylene Polymer (A) having a molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn, less than 3 and a short chain branching distribution indox (SCBDI) equal to or greater than 50 percent obtainable by polymerization of ethylene with at least one C3 -C20 α-olefin in the presence of a single site or constrained geometry catalyst;<br>
(B)	at least one ethylene Polymer(B) having a density at least<br><br>
0.005 g/cm^3 greater than the density of ethylene Polymer (A) and a TREF elution temperature at least 5'oC greater than the TREF elution temperature of ethylene Polymer (A) and, optionally,<br>
(C)	at least one ethylene Polymer (C) having a density at least<br>
0.005 g/cm greater than the density of ethylene Polymer (B) and a<br>
TREF elution temperature at least 5° C greater than the TREF elution<br>
Temperature of ethylene Polymer (B), and<br>
2)	optionally a filter at least partially dispersed with a compatibilizer<br>
in the polymer mixture,<br>
wherein the weight ratio of ethylene Polymer (B) to the total amount of ethylene Polymers (A) and (C) in the polymer mixture is at least 0.5, the weight ratio of any ethylene Polymer (C) to ethylene Polymer (A) does not exceed 2.0, and the total amount of ethylene Polymer (A) and any ethylene Polymer (C) in the polymer mixture is at least 25 wt% based on the total amount of polymers in the polymer mixture, and when less than 10 wt% filler is dispersed in the polymer mixture, than the melt index of Polymer (A) is preferably less than or equal to 1.5 g/10 min., the melt index ratio of Polymer (B) to Polymer (A) is preferably less than or equal to 5.0. and/or Polymer (B) is preferably a homogeneously branched ethylene polymer.<br><br>
Another aspect of this invention is polymer resin-based floor, wall and ceiling coverings comprising at least one layer of the above-described sheet material.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a mixture of the above-mentioned ethylene Polymers (A), (B) and, optionally, (C) for producing floor, wall or ceiling coverings. Such use includes, but is not limited to. use in a process for the production of a sheet material suitable for use as a floor, wall or ceiling covering which comprises:<br>
(1)	providing the above-mentioned ethylene Polymers (A), (B). and optionally (C);<br>
(2)	mixing the ethylene polymers of step (1) at an elevated temperature sufficient for melting those polymers, but below a temperature which causes substantial degradation of those polymers, to form a fluid mixture;<br>
(3)	forming the fluid mixture of step (2) into a sheet; and<br>
(4)	allowing the sheet of step (3) to cool and solidify.<br>
i<br>
A further aspect of this invention is intermediates for making a sheet material suitable for use as a floor, wall or ceiling covering material comprising a pelletized polymer mixture of the above-mentioned ethylene Polymers (A), (B) and, optionally. (C)<br>
By the term "floor, wall or ceiling covering" as used herein is meant an article with a length and width which are substantially greater than its thickness, such as a sheet, tile or board, which is useful to cover at least a portion of a floor, wall or ceiling and which adheres to the floor, wall or ceiling by means of static pressure or a fastening agent, such as an adhesive system. 'Substantially greater" generally means at least 10 times greater, preferably at least 50 times greater, more preferably at least 100 times greater.<br>
By the term "wall covering" or "ceiling covering" as used herein is meant an above-mentioned article, such as a sheet, tile or board, which is useful to cover at least a portion of a wall or of a ceiling and which adheres to<br><br>
the wall or ceiling by means of a fastening agent, such as an adhesive system, nails or screws.<br>
The term "unfilled composition" means a polymer mixture having less than 10, preferably less than or equal to 5. more preferably less than or equal to 1, wt% filler dispersed within it.<br>
The term "melt processing" as used herein refers to processing or working a polymer composition at temperatures elevated above its melting point in an extruder, calender, Haake mixer, Banbury, Henschel mixer, Brabender mixer, or Buss mixer.<br>
Percentages, ratios and the like are by weight unless stated otherwise. The abbreviatioin "cc" means "cubic centimeters" (i.e., cm3). The abbreviation "Ml" means "melt index (I.)". Unless otherwise specified below, properties such as Ml, density, melting point, mechanical properties and surface properties are measured as defined below under the heading "TESTING".<br>
The term "interpolymer" is used herein to indicate a polymer wherein at least two different monomers are polymerized to make the interpolymer.<br>
The term "copolymer" is used herein to indicate a polymer wherein two different monomers are polymerized to make the copolymer.<br>
For the purpose of describing this invention, the term "ethylene polymer" refers to a polymer in which at least 60 weight percent, preferably at least 70 weight percent, of the repeating units in the polymer are derived directly from ethylene. That term includes homogeneously branched ethylene polymers such as substantially linear ethylene polymers (SLEPs) (which are sold under the designation of AFFINITY and ENGAGE resins by The Dow Chemical Company and Dupont Dow Elastomers, respectively), homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers (such as those sold under the designation of TAFMER and EXACT resins by Mitsui Chemical Corporation and Exxon Chemical Corporation, respectively), heterogeneously<br>
branched linear ethylene polymer (such as those sold under the designation of ATTANE and DOWLEX by The Dow Chemical Company and under the designation of FLEXOMER by Union Carbide Corporation) and ethylene/propylene interpolymers having at least 60 percent of its units derived directly from ethylene. Ethylene Polymer (A) is required to be a homogeneously branched ethylene polymer.<br><br>
!<br>
The term "homogeneously branched ethylene polymer" moans an ethylene interpolymer in which the comonomer is randomly distributed within a given polymer molecule and wherein substantially all of the polymer molecules have the same ethylene to comonomer molar ratio. The term refers to an ethylene interpolymer that is characterized by a relatively high short chain branching distribution index (SCBDI) or composition distribution branching index (CDBI). That is, the interpolymer has a SCBDi greater than or equal to about 50 percent, preferably greater than or equal to about 70 percent,, more preferably greater than or equal to about 90 percent and generally lacks a measurable high density (crystalline) polymer fraction.<br>
SCBDI is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content and represents a comparison of the monomer distribution in the interpolymer to the monomer distribution expected for a Bernoullian distribution. The SCBDI of an interpolymer can be readily calculated from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation (abbreviated herein as "TREF") as described, for example, by Wild et al.. Journal of Polymer Science, Poly. Phys._Ed-, Vol. 20. p. 441 (1982), or in US Patent 4,798,081, or by L. D. Cady, "The Role of Comonomer Type and Distribution in LLDPE Product Performance." SPE Regional Technical Conference, Quaker Square Hilton, Akron, Ohio, October 1-2, pp. 107-119 (1985). However, the preferred TREF technique does not include purge quantities in SCBDI calculations. More preferably, the monomer distribution of the interpolymer and SCBDI are dotermined using 31C NMR analysis in accordance v^ith techniques described in US Patent 5,292,845 and by J. C. Randall in Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., 029. pp. 201-317.<br>
In addition to referring to a homogeneous (or narrow) short branching distribution, the term "homogeneously branched linear ethylene interpolymer" also means the interpolymer does not have long chain branching. That is, the ethylene interpolymer has an absence of long chain branching and a linear polymer backbone in the conventional sense of the term "linear." However, the term "homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymer" does not refer to high pressure branched polyethylene which is known to those skilled in the art to have numerous long chain branches. Homogeneously branched ethylene polymers can be made using polymerization processes (e.g., those described by Elston in US-A- 3,645.992) which provide a uniform (narrow) short<br><br>
branching distribution (i.e., homogeneously branched). In his polymerization process, Elston uses soluble vanadium catalyst systems to make such polymers, however others such as Mitsui Chemical Corporation and Exxon Chemical Corporation have used so-called single site catalyst systems to make polymers having a similar homogeneous structure. Homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers can be prepared in solution, slurry or gas phase processes using hafnium, zirconium and vanadium catalyst systems. Fwen et al. in US-A- 4,937,299 describes a method of preparation using metallocene catalysts.	The term "substantially linear ethylene polymer" as used herein refers to homogeneously branched ethylene-α -olefin interpolymers that have a narrow short chain branching distribution and contain long chain branches as well as short chain branches attributable to homogeneous comonomer incorporation. The long chain branches are of the same structure as the backbone of the polymer and are longer than the short chain branches. The polymer backbone of substantially linear α-olefin polymers is substituted with an average of 0.01 to 3 long chain branch/1000 carbons. Substantially linear ethylene polymers have certain processing advantages. When those advantages are desired, preferred substantially linear polymers for use in the invention are substituted with from 0.01 long chain branch/1000 carbons to 1 long chain branch/1000 carbons, and more preferably from 0.05 long chain branch/1000 carbons to 1 long chain branches/1000 carbons.<br>
Long chain branching is defined herein as a chain length of at least 6 carbons, above which the length cannot be distinguished using   C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Long chain branches are of greater length than the short chain branches resulting from comonomer incorporation.<br>
The presence of long chain branching can be determined in ethylene homopolymers by using   C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and is quantified using the method described by Randall (Rev. Macromoi. Chem..P.hys, C29. V. 2&amp;3. p. 285-297).<br>
As a practical matter, current 31C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy cannot determine the length of a long chain branch in excess of six carbon atoms.  However, there are other known techniques useful for determining the presence of long chain branches in ethylene polymers, including ethylene/1-octene interpolymers. Two such methods are gel<br><br>
permeation chromatography coupled with a low angle laser light scattering detector (GPC-LALLS) and gel permeation chromatography coupled with a differential viscometer detector (GPC-DV). The use of these techniques for long chain branch detection and the underlying theories have been well documented in the literature. See, for example, Zimm, G.H. and Stockmayer, W.H.. J. Chem. Phys., 17,1301 (1949) and Rudin, A., Modern Methods of Polymer Characterization. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1991) pp. 103-112.<br>
A. Willem deGroot and P. Steve Chum, both of The Dow Chemical Company, at the October 4, 1994 conference of the Federation of Analytical Chemistry and Spectroscopy Society (FACSS) In St. Louis, Missouri, presented data demonstrating that GPC-DV is a useful technique for quantifying the presence of long chain branches in substantially linear ethylene interpolymers. In particular, deGroot and Chum found that the level of long chain branches in substantially linear ethylene homopolymer samples measured using the Zimm-Stockmayer equation correlated well with the level of long chain branches measured using   C NMR.<br>
i j<br>
Further, deGroot and Chum found that the presence of octene does not change the hydrodynamic volume of the polyethylene samples in solution and, as such, one can account for the molecular weight increase attributable to octene short chain branches by knowing the mole percent octene in the sample   By deconvoluting the contribution to molecular weight Increase attributable to 1-octene short chain branches, deGroot and Chum showed that GPC DV may be used to quantify the level of long chain branches in substantially linear ethylene/octene copolymers.<br>
deGroot and Chum also showed that a plot of Log(l2, Melt Index) as a<br>
function of Log(GPC Weight Average Molecular Weight) as determined by GPCDV illustrates that the long chain branching aspects (but not the extent of long branching) of substantially linear ethylene polymers are comparable to that of high pressure, highly branched low density polyethylene (LDPE) and<br>
are clearly distinct from ethylene polymers produced using Ziegler-type catalysts such as titanium complexes and ordinary homogeneous catalysts such as hafnium and vanadium complexes.<br>
The term "heterogeneously branched linear ethylene polymer" is used herein in the conventional sense in reference to a linear ethylene interpolymer having a comparatively low short chain branching distribution index. That is, the interpolymer has a relatively broad short chain branching dietribution.<br><br>
Heterogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers have a SCBDI less than about 50 percent and more typically less than about 30 percent.<br>
Heterogeneously branched ethylene polymers are well known among practitioners of the linear polyethylene art. Heterogeneously branched ethylene polymers are prepared using conventional Ziegler-Natta solution, slurry or gas phase polymerization processes and coordination metal catalysts as described, for example. by Anderson et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,076,698. These conventional Ziegler-type linear polyethylenes are not homogeheously branched, do not have any long-chain branching and have a linear polymer backbone in the conventional sense of the term "linear." Also, heterogeneously branched ethylene polymore do not show any substantial amorphism at lower densities since they inherently posses a substantial high density (crystalline) polymer fraction. At densities less than 0.90 g/cc, these materials are more difficult to prepare than homogeneously branched ethylene polymer and are also more difficult to pelletie than their higher density counterparts. At such lower densities, heterogeneously branched ethylene polymer pellets are generally more tacky and have a greater tendency to clump together than their higher density counterparts.<br>
The term "ethylene/propylene interpolymer" as used herein refers to polymer having at least ethylene and propylene interpolymerized therein. Unless othenwise specified, such interpolymer may have a higher ethylene content than propylene and vice versa and include other monomers such as, for example, at least one diene or at least other α-olefin.<br>
Typically, the homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymer and the heterogeneously branched ethylene polymer are ethylene/α-oiefin interpolymers, wherein the α-olefin is at least one C1-C10 α-olefin (e.g., propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and the like) and preferably the at least one Cα-Cpo α-olefin is 1-hexene. Most preferably, the ethylene/α-olefin interpolymer is a copolymer of ethylene and a C3-C20 α~olefin, especially an ethylene/C4-C6 α-olefin copolymer and most especially an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer.<br>
Included among the preferred homogeneously branched ethylene polymers for use in the present invention are substantially linear ethylene polymers due to their improved melt extrusion processability and unique rheological properties as described by Lai et. al in US Patent Nos. 5,272,236<br>
and 5,278,272.<br><br>
Substantially linear ethylene polymers differ significantly from the class of polymers conventionally known as homogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers described, for example, by Elston in US Patent 3,845,992, in that substantially linear ethylene polymers do not have a linear polymer backbone in the conventional sense of the term "linear." Substantially linear ethylene polymers also differ significantly from the class of polymers known conventionally as heterogeneously branched traditional Ziegler polymerized linear ethylene Interpolymers (for example, ultra low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene or high density polyethylene made, for example, using the technique disclosed by Anderson et al. in US Patent 4,076,698. in that substantially linear ethylene interpolymers are homogeneously branched interpolymers. Substantially linear ethylene polymers also differ significantly from the class known as free-radical initiated highly branched high pressure low density ethylene homopolymer and ethylene interpolymers such as, for example, ethylene-acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers and ethylene-vinyi acetate (EVA) copolymers, in that substantially linear ethylene polymers do not have equivalent degrees of long chain branching and are made using single site catalyst systems rather than free-radical peroxide catalysts systems.<br>
Single site polymerization catalyst, (for example, the monocyclo-pentadienyl transition metal olefin polymerization catalysts described by Canich in US Patent 5,026,798 or by Canich in US Patent 5,055,438) or constrained geometry catalysts (for example, as described by Stevens et al. in US Patent 5,064.802) can be used to prepare substantially linear ethylene polymers, so long as the catalysts are used consistent with the methods described in US Patent 5,272,236 and in US Patent 5,278.272. Such polymerization methods are also described in PCT/US 92/08812 (filed October 15, 1992), However, the substantially linear ethylene polymers are preferably made by using suitable constrained geometry catalysts, especially constrained geometry catalysts [as the catalysts used to make the SLEPs used in this invention] and methods for their preparation [are] disclosed in EP-α-416,815 and EP-A-514.828 as well as in U.S. Patents 5,470,993; 5,374,696; 5,231,106; 5,055,438; 5,057,475; 5,091.352; 5,096,867; 5.064,802; 5,132,380; 5,153,157; 5,183,867; 5.189.192; 5,198,401; 5.272.236; 6,278,272; 5.321.106; 5,453.410; 5.470.993; 5,486.632; 5,494,879 and 5,532,394.<br><br>
In EP-α-514,828, certain borane derivatives of metallocene complex catalysts are disclosed and a method for their preparation taught and claimed in U.S. Patent 5,453,410 combinations of cationic metallocene complex catalysts with an alumoxane were disclosed as suitable olefin polymerization catalysts.<br>
Suitable cooatalyats for use herein include but are not limited to, for example, polymeric or oligomeric aluminoxanes, especially methyl aluminoxane or modified methyl aluminoxarie (made, for example, as described in US Patent 5,041,584, US Patent 4,544,762. US Patent 5,015,749, and/or us Patent 5,041,585 as well as Inert, compatible, non-coordinating, ion forming compounds.  Preferred cocatalysts are inert, non-coordinating, boron compounds.<br>
The polymerization conditions for manufacturing the substantially linear ethylene polymers useful in the present invention are preferably those useful in the continuous solution polymerization process, although the application of the present invention Is not limited thereto.<br>
The substantially linear ethylene polymers that may be used in the present invention may be characterized as having<br>
(a)	a melt flow ratio, I /I &gt; 5.63,<br>
(b)	a molecular weight distribution, M /M . as determined by gel<br>
Tf	'I<br>
permeation chromatography and defined by the equation: (M /M ) 
^    w     n	10  2'<br>
(c)	a gas extrusion rheology such that the critical shear rate at<br>
onset of surface melt fracture for the substantially linear ethylene polymer Is<br>
at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface<br>
melt fracture for a linear ethylene polymer, preferably wherein the<br>
substantially linear ethylene polymer and the linear ethylene polymer<br>
comprise the same comonomer or comonomers, the linear ethylene polymer has an i2 M /M and density within ten percent of the substantially linear<br>
ethylene polymer and wherein the respective critical shear rates of the substantially linear ethylene polymer and the linear ethylene polymer are measured at the same melt temperature using a gas extrusion rheometer.<br><br>
(d)	preferably a single differential scanning calorimetry, DSC, melting peak between -30 and 150oC. and<br>
(e)	a short chain branching distribution index greater than about 50 percent.<br>
The substantially linear ethylene polymers that may be used in this invention are homogeneously branched interpolymers and essentially lack a measurable "high density" fraction as measured by the TREF technique (i.e., have a narrow short chain distribution and a high SCBD index). The substantially linear ethytene polymer generally do not contain a polymer fraction with a degree of branching less than or equal to 2 methyls/1000 carbons. The "high density polymer fraction" can also be described as a polymer fraction with a degree of branching less than about 2 methyls/1000 carbons.<br>
The substantially linear ethylene interpolymers that may be used in the present invention are interpolymers of ethylene with at least on© C3-C20 α-olefin and/or C4-C18 diolefin. Copolymers bf ethylene and an α-olefin of α-C20 carbon atoms are especially preferred. The term "interpolymer" is used<br>
herein to indicate a copolymer, or a terpolymer, or the like, where, at least one other comonomer is polymerized with ethylene to make the Interpolymer.<br>
Suitable unsaturated comonomers useful for polymerizing with<br>
ethylene include, for example, ethylenically unsaturated monomers,<br>

Determination of the critical shear rate and critical shear stress in regards to melt fracture as well as other rheology properties such as "rheological processing index" (PI), is performed using a gas extrusion rheometer (GER). The gas extrusion rheometer is described by M. Shida, R N. Shroff and L.V. Cancio in Polymer Engineering Science. Vol. 17, No. 11,<br><br>
p. 770 (1977). and in "Rheometers for Molten Plastics" by John Dealy, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on pp. 97-99. GER experiments are performed at a temperature of about 190oC. at nitrogen pressures between about 250 to about 5500 psig (about 1.83 to about 38.03 MPa using about a 0.0754 mm diameter, 20:1 L/D die with an entrance angle of about 180o For the substantially linear ethylene polymers described herein, the PI is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise, whereby 1 kpoise equals 100 Pas) of a material measured by GER at an apparent shear stress of<br>
about 2.15 X 106 dyne/cm2 (which is equivalent to 21.5 N/cm2). The substantially linear ethylene polymer for use in the invention are ethylene interpolymers having a PI in the range of about 0.01 kpoise to about 50 kpoise (about 1 to about 5000 Pas), preferably about 15 kpoise (about 1500 Pas) or less. The substantially linear ethylene polymers used herein have a<br>
PI less than or equal to about 70 percent of the PI of a linear ethylene<br>
interpolymer (either a conventional Ziegler polymerized interpolymer or a<br>
linear homogeneously branched interpolymer as described by Elston in US Patent 3,645,992) having an 12, Mw/Mn and density, each within ten percent of<br>
the substantially linear ethylene interpolymer<br>
An apparent shear stress versus apparent shear rate plot is used to identify the melt fracture phenomena and quantify the critical shear rate and critical shear stress of ethylene polymers. According to Ramamurthy in the Journal of Rheoloay. 30(2). 337-357, 1986, above a certain critical flow rate, the observed extrudate irregularities may be broadly classified into two main types: surface melt fracture and gross melt fracture.<br>
Surface melt fracture occurs under apparently steady flow conditions and ranges in detail from loss of specular film gloss to the more severe form of "sharkskin." Herein, as determined using the above-described GER, the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) is characterized at the beginning of losing extrudate gloss at which the surface roughness of the extrudate can only be detected by 40x magnification. The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers is at least about 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of<br>
surface melt fracture of a linear ethylene interpolymer having essentially the same L and Mw /Mn .<br>
Gross melt fracture occurs at unsteady extrusion flow conditions and ranges in detail from regular (alternating rough and smooth, helical, etc.) to<br><br>
random distortions. For commercial acceptability and maximum wear layer scratch and abrasion properties, surface defects should be minimal, if not absent. The critical shear stress at the onset of gross melt fracture for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers used in the invention, that is those having a density less than about 0.91 g/cc, is greater than about 4 x 106 dynes/cm2 The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) and the onset of gross melt fracture (OGMF) will be used herein based on the changes of surface roughness and configurations of the exlrudates extruded by a GER. Preferably, in the present invention, the substantially linear ethylene polymer will be characterized by its critical shear rate, rather than its critical shear stress.<br>
Substantially linear ethylene polymers also consist of a single polymer component material and are characterized by a single differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) melting peak. The single melting peak is determined using a DSC standardized with indium and deionized water. The method involves about 5-7 mg sample sizes, a "first heat" to about 140X which is held for about 4 minutes, a cool down at about 107min. to about -30'o C which is held for about 3 minutes, and heat up at about 10° C/min. to about 180° C for the "second heat". The single melting peak is taken from the "second heat" heat flow vs. temperature curve. Total heat of fusion of the polymer is calculated from the area under the curve.<br>
For substantially linear ethylene interpolymers having a density of about 0.875 g/cc to about 0.91 g/cc, the single melting peak may show, depending on equipment sensitivity, a "shoulder" or a "hump" on the low melting side that constitutes less than about 12 percent, typically, less than about 9 percent, and more typically less than about 6 percent of the total heat of fusion of the polymer Such an artifact is observable for other homogeneously branched polymers such as EXACT resins and is discerned on the basis of the slope of the single melting peak varying monotonically through the melting region of the artifact. Such an artifact occurs within about 34oC, typically within about 27oC, and more typically within about 20oC of the melting point of the single melting peak. The heat of fusion attributable to an artifact can be separately determined by specific integration of its associated area under the heat flow vs. temperature curve.<br>
The molecular weight distributions of ethylene α-olefin polymers are determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) on a Waters 150C high<br><br>
temperature chromatographic unit equipped with a differential refractometer and three columns of mixed porosity. The columns are supplied by Polymer Laboratories and are commonly packed with pore sizes of 10 , 10,4 10 and 10A (10-4, 10-3 10-2 and 10' mm). The solvent is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, from which about 0.3 percent by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection. The flow rate is about 1.0miliiliters/minute, unit operating temperature is about 140o C and the injection size is about 100 microliters.<br>
The molecular weight determination with respect to the polymer backbone is deduced by using narrow moletular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories) In conjunction with their elution volumes. The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights are determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene and polystyrene (as described by Williams and Ward in Journal of Polymer Science. Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, p. 621,1968) to derive the following equation:<br>
Mpolyethylene =a* (Mpolystyrene)b-<br>
In this equation, a = 0.4316 and b = 1.0. Weight average molecular weight, Mw, is calculated in the usual manner according to the following<br>
formula; Mj = (S W|(Mi*)y; where W, is the weight fraction of the molecules with<br>
molecular weight Mt eluting from the GPC column in fraction i and j = 1 when<br>
calculating Mn and j = -1 when calculating Mn.<br>
For the homogeneously branched ethylene interpolymers used in the present invention, the Mw/Mn is preferably less than about 3, more preferably<br>
less than about 2,5, and especially from about 1.5 to about 2.5 and most especially from about 18 to about 2.3.<br>
Substantially linear ethylene polymers are known to have excellent<br>
processability, despite having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (for purposes of this invention, the Mw/Mn ratio is generally less than about<br>
3.0, preferably less than about 2.5, and more preferably less than about 2).<br>
Surprisingly, unlike homogeneously and heterogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers, the melt flow ratio (I`0/I2) of substantially linear ethylene<br>
polymers can be varied essentially independently of the molecular weight distribution. Mw/Mn. Accordingly, the preferred ethylene α-olefin polymer for<br><br>
use in the present invention is a substantially linear ethylene polymer. Preferred Ranges:<br>

Fillers (D):	The sheet material of the present Invention may contain 0 to 90 wt% of a filler of inorganic- (talc, CaCO3, Dolomite, SiO2, aluminium trihydrate etc.) or organic type (wood, UHMWPE, cellulose, etc.). The preferred amount of filler<br><br>
greatly varies, depending on the desired stiffness and mode of application of the floor, wall or ceiling covering. Floor, wall or ceiling sheetings preferably do not contain a filler. However, If they contain 'a filler, the amount of the filler preferably is from 10 to about 70 percent, more preferably from about 15 to about 50, even more preferably from about 30 to about 50, such as about 55, percent, based on the total weight of the sheeting. Floor tiles, wall tiles or ceiling tiles may contain from about 50 to about 90 percent of a filler, based on the weight of the floor, wall or ceiling covering.<br>
The amount of added organic filler is preferably low. However, other demands (i.e. haptic, feel, etc.) may require the addition of some organic filler. The typical amount of organic filler in the honnogeneous unfilled flooring is<br>
lower than 20 wt%. Typically 8 to 16 wt% may be used.<br>
A certain level of inorganic filler may be added based on other<br>
considerations (costs, flame/ignition retardant requirements). The level of this<br>
type is preferred to remain low to get the best balance of properties according to this invention. The preferred level of inorganic filler in the sheet material of this invention is typically In the range of 15 to 65 wt%, more specifically between 20 to 60 wt%.<br>

Typically, less than 5 Wt% is used   Examples of typical additives include: antioxidants, such as hindered phenols or phosphites; light stabilizers, such as hindered amines; piasticizers, such as dioctylphthalate or<br><br>
epoxidized soy bean oil; tackifiers, such as known hydrocarbon tackifiers; waxes, such as polyethylene waxes; processing aids such as stearic acid or a metal salt thereof; crosslinking agents, such as peroxides or sllanes; colorants or pigments to the extent that they do not interfere with the good conformability to uneven or contoured surfaces, scratch resistance and/or indentation recovery of the floor, wall or ceiling covering of the present invention. The additives are employed in functionally equivalent amounts known to those skilled in the art, generally in amounts of up to about 30, preferably from about 0.01 to about 5, more preferably from about 0.02 to about 1 percent by weight, based upon the weight of the floor, wall or ceiling covering.<br>

However, with respect to antioxidants and stabilizers, only nominal quantities such as 100 to 2500 ppm will generally be required to successfully melt process the preferred poiyolefin polymers used in the present invention.<br>
Fabricated layers such as for lamination operations may also contain additives to enhance handling, antiblocking and coefficient of friction characteristics Including, but not limited to, untreated and treated silicon dioxide, tain, calcium carbonate, and clay, as well as primary and secondary fatty acid amides, silicone coatings, etc. Still other additives, such as quaternary ammonium compounds alone or in combination with ethylene acrylic acid (EAA) copolymers or other functional polymers, commercial antistatic additives (e.g., HOSTASTATTM, a glycerin fatty acid ester available from Hoechst Corp , IRGASTAT™ available from Ciba Geigy and ATMER available from ICI) and hydrophobic fillers such as, for example, talc can also be added to the poiyolefin polymer for the purpose of meeting surface and volume resistivity standards.<br><br>
Compatabilizers are often added to formulations containing one or more fillers to compatabilize the filler(s) with the polymer mixture components Examples of compatabilizers include acrylic acid, maleic anhydride (MAH), fumaric acid or other polar monomer grafted onto polyolefins or incorporated as copolymers in an interpolymer, such as MAH grafted high density polyethylene (MAH-HDPE), MAH grafted polypropylene (MAH-PP) for instance FPOLENETM E43P available from Eastman Kodak Company, ADMERTM available from Mitsui Chemical Corporation, PRIMACORETM available from The Dow Chemical Company and SURLYNTM available from DuPont.<br>
The sheet materials of this invention may also contain foaming agents. Foaming agents are described later in more detail.<br>
Oils{F}:<br>
Various oils can be compounded into the polyolefin polymer to reduce formulation costs, enhance flexibility and filler acceptability and/or to reduce dusting during compounding. Suitable oils include, for example, paraffinic and hydrogenated oils (e.g., SUNPAR available from Sun Oil Company and MFDINOL available from Witco) although naphthenic and aromatic oils may also be used. In general, the amount of oil that can be successfully added without incurring signs of incompatibility sucH as, for example, bleed-out, will Increase as the viscosity of the oil decreases and/or the crystallinity of the polyolefin polymer decreases.<br>

The polymer blend or mixture may be formed by any convenient method, including dry blending the individual polymers and subsequently melt mixing in a mixer or by mixing the polymers together directly in a mixer (e.g., a Banbury mixer, a Haake mixer, a Brabender internal mixer, or a single or twin screw extruder including a compounding extruder and a side-arm extruder employed directly down stream of a interpolymerization process).<br>
Preferably, the polymer mixtures of the present invention are prepared using two reactors operated in series or in parallel, or by in-reactor blending using two or more catalysts in a single reactor or combinations of multiple catalysts and multiple reactors.

Specifically, the layer(s) containing the above-descdbed substantially random interpolymer(s) and/or one or more of the above-described additional polymenc layer(s), if present, may be foamed.<br>
The foam layer(s) may be produced by an extrusion process or from expandable or foamable particles, moldable foam particles, or beads from which a sheet is formed by expansion and/or coalescing and welding of those particles.-<br>
The foam structure may be made by a conventional extrusion foaming process. The structure is generally prepared by heating a polymer material to form a piastlclzed or melt polymer material, Incorporating therein a known blowing agent to form a foamable gel, and extruding the gel through a die to form the foam product. Prior to mixing with the blowing agent, the polymer material is heated to a temperature at or above its glass transition temperature or melting point. The blowing agent may be incorporated or mixed into the melt polymer material by any means known in the art such as with an extruder, mixer or blender. The blowing agent is mixed with the melt polymer matenal at an elevated pressure sufficient to prevent substantial expansion of the melt polymer material and to generally disperse the blowing agent homogeneously therein. Optionally, a nucleator may be blended in the<br>
polymer melt or dry blended with the polymer material prior to plasticizing or melting. The foamable get is typically cooled to a lower temperature to optimize physical characteristics of the foam, structure- The gel is then extruded or conveyed through a die of desired shape to a zone of reduced or lowor pressure to form the foam structure. The die can have a substantially rectangular orifice to produce a sheet of the desired width and height. Alternatively, the die can have multiple orifices to produce polymer strands which can be cut to beads.   The zone of lower pressure is at a pressure lower than that in which the foamable gel is maintained prior to extrusion through the die. The lower pressure may be superatmospheric or subatmospheric (vacuum), but is preferably at an atmospheric level.<br>
Suitable melt processingfoaming techniques include roll milling, Haake torque mixing, kneadering, calendering, extrusion casting and hot blown film fabrication wherein prior to the melt processing, the mixture of ethylene polymfers is compounded with about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent, preferably<br><br>
about 1 to about 3,6 weight percent of a suitable chemical blowing agent such as, for example, but not limited to, azodicarbonamide, with or without a suitable kicker such as a metal oxide (e.g., zinc oxide) and without a foam<br>
stabilizer, such as, for example, sodium sulphosuccinimate, as is typically<br>
required for aqueous latex foams.<br>
The  foam structure may also be formed into foam beads suitable for molding into articles. To make the foam beads, discrete resin particles such as granulated resin pellets are suspended in a liquid medium in which they are substantially insoluble such as water; impregnated with a blowing agent by introducing the blowing agent into the liquid medium at an elevated pressure and temperature in an autoclave or other pressure vessel; and rapidly discharged into the atmosphere or a region of reduced pressure to expand to form the foam beads. This process is well taught in US-α-4,379,859 and US-α-4,464.484.<br>
The foam beads may then be molded by any means known in the art, such as charging the foam beads to the mold, compressing the mold to compress the beads, and heating the beads such as with steam to effect coalescing and welding of the beads to form the article. Optionally, the beads may be impregnated with air or other blowing agent at an elevated pressure and temperature prior to charging to the mold. Further, the beads may be heated prior to charging. The foam beads may then be molded to sheets by a suitable molding method known in the art. Some of the methods are taught in US α- 3,504,068 and US-α-3,953,558.<br>
Various additives may be incorporated in the foam structure, such as stability control agents, nucleating agents, inorganic fillers, pigments, antioxidants, acid scavengers, ultraviolet absorbers, flame retardants, processing aids or extrusion aids. Some of the additives are described in more detail above.<br>
Also, the polymer foam may be crosslinked (whether microcellular or not) by various methods such as those described in US Paten,t No. 5,288,762 and by CP, Park in "Polyolefin Foam," Handbook of Polymer Foams and Technology. Chapter 9,Hanser Publishers. New York (1991). Suitable crosslinking methods include adding a crosslinking agent (e.g., dicumyl peroxide) to the polymers prior to extrusion or by irradiating the polymers prior to or after foaming or by using an extruder in the melt processing which has a<br><br>
long-land die such as described in GB Patent No. 2,145,961A to effectuati thermal oxidative crosslinking.<br>
The floor sheeting, floor tiles, wall sheeting and wall tiles according to this invention is useful in buildings and in geological areas, for example in caves or tunnels as PVC replacement. The floor, wall or ceiling coverings of the present invention have a number properties which make them particularly suitable for the intended end-use.  Depending on the chosen types and amounts of substantially random interpolymer(s) and optional additives, the floor and wall coverings of the present invention have some or all of these properties, such as good indentation resistance, indentation recovery, good flexibility and conformability over contoured or uneven surfaces, good scratch resistance and/or good abrasion resistance.<br>
One commercial benefit of the present invention is that it does not have the substantial environmental impact ordinarily associated with PVC flooring and wall covedng products. That is, the inventive product does not require heavy metal stabilizers, nitrosamines derived from curing agents or accelerators, plastlclzers with a high volatile organic content, nor chlorine containing polymers and is low in ash after incineration. Thus, the inventive product can be conveniently recycled using conventional energy recovery methods based on Incineration.<br>
Another benefit of the invention is that the polymer mixture can bo melt processed on ordinary PVC equipment such as a two-roll mill and three-roll calender equipment. Melt processing equipment such as calender rolls present a particularly aggressive thermal environment in that the polymer melt is substantially exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Ordinan/ polyolefin polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers are generally too thermally sensitive to be melt processed on PVC equipment and as such are employed in flooring systems by alternate techniques such as powder scattering and sintering.<br>
Another commercial benefit is ease of shipping and installation. Whereas a non-filled PVC flooring or wall covering product typically has a bulk density of 1.v3 kg/liter, the inventive product is lightweight (i.e., is preferably characterized as having a bulk density of from about 0.8 to about 0.9 kg/liter) and yet generally exhibits the performance durability of PCV covering. It also retains sufficient strength and moldability at elevated temperatures to allow<br><br><br>
corona or flame treatment or acrylic primers in combination with these adhesives is generally not necessary.<br>
The invention  products have a superior balance of mechanical and surface properties. A high balance indicates the ability to reconcile inconsistent objectives. That can be measured through the use of the following equations.<br><br>
wherein X is a num©ric value which is preferably 200, more preferably 400, even more preferably 600, and the remaining values are explained in the Testing section below.   The % recovery is preferably at least 90, more preferably at least 95, and even more preferably at least 100, percent.
