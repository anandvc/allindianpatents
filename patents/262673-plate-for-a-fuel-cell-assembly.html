				<td>PLATE FOR A FUEL CELL ASSEMBLY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to a fuel cell assembly, and more<br>
particularly to a plate such as a bipolar plate for a fuel cell assembly having a<br>
plurality of active regions electrically insulated from one another.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] A fuel cell has been proposed as a clean, efficient and environmentally<br>
responsible power source for electric vehicles and various other applications. In<br>
particular, the fuel cell has been identified as a potential alternative for the<br>
traditional internal-combustion engine used in modern vehicles.<br>
[0003] One type of fuel cell is known as a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel<br>
cell. The PEM fuel cell typically includes three basic components: a cathode, an<br>
anode, and an electrolyte membrane. The cathode and anode typically include a<br>
finely divided catalyst, such as platinum, supported on carbon particles and<br>
mixed with an ionomer. The electrolyte membrane is sandwiched between the<br>
cathode and the anode to form a membrane-electrolyte-assembly (MEA). The<br>
MEA is often disposed between porous diffusion media (DM) which facilitate a<br>
delivery of gaseous reactants, typically hydrogen and oxygen from air, for an<br>
electrochemical fuel cell reaction.<br>
[0004] As described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,127,058, individual fuel cells may be<br>
aligned in a planar array that is electrically connected via interconnect tabs. In<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,080,503 and 6,495,278, electrochemical fuel cell stacks having<br>
adhesively bonded layers formed for individual fuel cell modules are also<br>
described. PEM-type fuel cell assemblies having multiple parallel fuel cell<br>
substacks that employ shared fluid plate assemblies and shared membrane<br>
electrode assemblies are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,945,232.<br>
[0005] In automotive applications, individual fuel cells are often stacked together<br>
in series to form a fuel cell stack with a voltage sufficient to provide power to an<br>
electric vehicle. Connecting individual fuel cells in series requires the fabrication<br><br><br>
and handling of a multitude of individual fuel cells, however. A height of the<br>
resultant fuel cell stack having the multitude of individual fuel cells may limit<br>
placement of the fuel cell stack within an electric vehicle. Furthermore, DC-to-<br>
DC voltage converters are typically employed in fuel cell systems to enable the<br>
fuel cell stack to achieve the sufficient voltage. Voltage converters and related<br>
componentry add undesirable complexity to the fuel cell system.<br>
[0006] There is a continuing need for a simplified fuel cell assembly which<br>
militates against the need for DC-to-DC converters, the need to fabricate a<br>
multitude of individual fuel cells, and facilitates a placement of the fuel cell<br>
assembly within a vehicle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] In concordance with the instant disclosure, a simplified fuel cell assembly<br>
which militates against the necessity for DC-to-DC converters, militates against<br>
the necessity to fabricate multiple individual fuel cells, and facilitates a placement<br>
of the fuel cell assembly in a vehicle, is surprisingly discovered.<br>
[0008] In one embodiment, a unitized fuel cell plate includes a plurality of active<br>
regions formed thereon and electrically insulated from one another. The unitized<br>
fuel cell plate further includes a plurality of inlet and outlet apertures formed<br>
therein. Each one of the plurality of active regions is in fluid communication with<br>
one of the inlet apertures. The one of the inlet apertures is adapted to selectively<br>
deliver reactants to the one of the plurality of active regions.<br>
[0009] In another embodiment, a fuel cell assembly is provided. The fuel cell<br>
assembly includes a plurality of fuel cell stack units disposed adjacent one<br>
another and electrically connected in series. The fuel cell stacks may be formed<br>
with a plurality of the unitized plates. The plurality of fuel cell stacks yields a<br>
voltage sufficient to power an electric vehicle.<br>
[0010] In a further embodiment, a method for operating the fuel cell assembly<br>
includes the steps of providing a plurality of fuel cell stacks including a plurality of<br>
unitized bipolar plates and a plurality of unitized membrane-electrode<br>
assemblies, connecting the fuel cell stacks in electrical series, and selectively<br><br>
supplying gaseous reactants to each of the plurality of fuel cell stacks. A fuel cell<br>
assembly having a voltage sufficient to power an electric vehicle is thereby<br>
provided.<br>
DRAWINGS<br>
[0011] The above, as well as other advantages of the present disclosure, will<br>
become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description, particularly when considered in the light of the drawings described<br>
hereafter.<br>
[0012] FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic, exploded perspective view of a PEM fuel<br>
cell stack of the prior art, showing only two cells;<br>
[0013] FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a fuel cell assembly including a plurality of<br>
fuel cell stacks connected in series according to an embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure;<br>
[0014] FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a fuel cell assembly including plurality of<br>
fuel cell stacks connected in series according to an embodiment of the present<br>
disclosure; and<br>
[0015] FIG. 4 is an enlarged perspective view of a unitized fuel cell plate and a<br>
unitized membrane assembly of the fuel cell assembly illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not<br>
intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should also be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. In respect of the methods<br>
disclosed, the steps presented are exemplary in nature, and thus, are not<br>
necessary or critical.<br>
[0017] FIG. 1 depicts an illustrative fuel cell stack 2 having a pair of MEAs 4, 6<br>
separated from each other by an electrically conductive bipolar plate 8. For<br>
simplicity, only a two-cell stack (i.e. one bipolar plate) is illustrated and described<br><br>
in FIG. 1, it being understood that the typical fuel cell stack 2 will have many<br>
more such cells and bipolar plates.<br>
[0018] The MEAs 4, 6 and bipolar plate 8 are stacked together between a pair of<br>
clamping plates 10, 12 and a pair of unipolar end plates 14, 16. The clamping<br>
plates 10, 12 are electrically insulated from the end plates 14, 16 by a gasket or a<br>
dielectric coating (not shown). The unipolar end plate 14, both working faces of<br>
the bipolar plate 8, and the unipolar end plate 16 include respective active areas<br>
18, 20, 22, 24. The active areas 18, 20, 22, 24 are typically flow fields for<br>
distributing gaseous reactants such as hydrogen gas and air over an anode and<br>
a cathode, respectively, of the MEAs 4, 6.<br>
[0019] The bipolar plate 8 is typically formed by a conventional process for<br>
shaping sheet metal such as stamping, machining, molding, or photo etching<br>
through a photolithographic mask, for example. In one embodiment, the bipolar<br>
plate 8 is formed from unipolar plates which are then joined. It should be further<br>
understood that the bipolar plate 8 may also be formed from a composite<br>
material. In one particular embodiment, the bipolar plate 8 is formed from a<br>
graphite or graphite-filled polymer.<br>
[0020] Nonconductive gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32 provide seals and an electrical<br>
insulation between the several components of the fuel cell stack 2. Gas-<br>
permeable diffusion media 34, 36, 38, 40 are adjacent the anodes and the<br>
cathodes of the MEAs 4, 6. The end plates 14, 16 are disposed adjacent the<br>
diffusion media 34, 40, respectively, while the bipolar plate 8 is disposed<br>
adjacent the diffusion media 36 on the anode face of MEA 4. The bipolar plate 8<br>
is further disposed adjacent the diffusion media 38 on the cathode face of MEA<br>
6.<br>
[0021] The bipolar plate 8, unipolar end plates 14, 16, and the gaskets 26, 28, 30,<br>
32 each include a cathode supply aperture 72 and a cathode exhaust aperture<br>
74, a coolant supply aperture 75 and a coolant exhaust aperture 77, and an<br>
anode supply aperture 76 and an anode exhaust aperture 78. Supply manifolds<br>
and exhaust manifolds of the fuel cell stack 2 are formed by an alignment of the<br>
respective apertures 72, 74, 75, 77, 76, 78 in the bipolar plate 8, unipolar end<br><br>
plates 14, 16, and the gaskets 26, 28, 30, 32. The hydrogen gas is supplied to<br>
an anode supply manifold via an anode inlet conduit 80. The air is supplied to a<br>
cathode supply manifold of the fuel cell stack 2 via a cathode inlet conduit 82. An<br>
anode outlet conduit 84 and a cathode outlet conduit 86 are also provided for an<br>
anode exhaust manifold and a cathode exhaust manifold, respectively. A coolant<br>
inlet conduit 88 is provided for supplying liquid coolant to a coolant supply<br>
manifold. A coolant outlet conduit 90 is provided for removing coolant from a<br>
coolant exhaust manifold. It should be understood that the configurations of the<br>
various inlets 80, 82, 88 and outlets 84, 86, 90 in FIG. 1 are for the purpose of<br>
illustration, and other configurations may be chosen as desired.<br>
[0022] FIG. 2 shows a plurality of individual fuel cell stack 2 units in a fuel cell<br>
assembly 200. The plurality of individual fuel cell stacks 2 may be disposed<br>
adjacent one another to form a "bank" of fuel cell stacks 2, thus enabling a<br>
convenient placement of the fuel cell assembly 200 in a vehicle. Each of the fuel<br>
cell stacks 2 is adapted to receive a dedicated supply of gaseous reactants. The<br>
dedicated supplying of gaseous reactants enables an independent control of the<br>
fuel cell stack 2 units of the fuel cell assembly 200.<br>
[0023] The fuel cell stacks 2 are electrically connected in series to a first terminal<br>
202 and second terminal 204. The first terminal 202 may be connected to one of<br>
the end plates 14 of the fuel cell stacks 2, and the second terminal 204 may be<br>
connected to one of the end plates 16 of the fuel cell stacks 2, for example. The<br>
first terminal 202 and the second terminal 204 are in electrical communication<br>
with an external load (not shown) such as a drive of an electric vehicle or a<br>
battery bank, for example.<br>
[0024] FIG. 3 shows a plurality of fuel cell stacks 2 joined together to form the<br>
fuel cell assembly 200 according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In<br>
the embodiment shown, the fuel cell assembly 200 includes at least one<br>
electrically insulating layer 300 disposed between adjacent fuel cell stacks 2.<br>
The electrically insulating layer 300 is formed of any conventional electrically<br>
insulating material known in the art such as a thermoplastic material and a<br>
thermoset material, for example. It is understood that the thermoplastic material<br><br>
and thermoset material may be rigid or elastic. A skilled artisan should<br>
appreciate that other suitable insulating materials may be employed as desired.<br>
[0025] FIG. 4 illustrates a unitized plate 400 of the fuel cell assembly 200. The<br>
unitized plate 400 is adapted to be stacked with corresponding fuel cell<br>
components, such as MEAs, gaskets, and endplates, in a configuration<br>
substantially as shown in FIG. 1. As used herein, the term "unitized" means that<br>
the unitized plates 400 provide independently operating fuel cell stack 2 units<br>
when stacked to form the fuel cell assembly 200. It is understood that the<br>
unitized plate 400 can be a bipolar plate or a unipolar plate, if desired. In the<br>
embodiment shown, the unitized plate 400 is formed with a plurality of active<br>
regions 402, 404. The active regions 402, 404 of the unitized plate 400 are<br>
electrically conductive and serve as current collectors for the fuel cell stacks 2 in<br>
the fuel cell assembly 200. The active regions 402, 404 are electrically insulated<br>
from one another.<br>
[0026] Headers 406 are disposed at a first end and a second end of the unitized<br>
plate 400. In particular embodiments, the headers 406 are formed from an<br>
electrically insulating or dielectric material having an electrical resistance<br>
sufficient to militate against a flow of electrical current therethrough. The active<br>
regions 402, 404 are further separated by electrically insulating dividers 408.<br>
The electrically insulating dividers 408 may be formed from any conventional<br>
electrically insulating material known in the art such as a thermoplastic material<br>
and a thermoset material, for example. It is understood that the thermoplastic<br>
material and thermoset material may be rigid or electrometric. A skilled artisan<br>
should appreciate that other suitable insulating materials may be employed as<br>
desired.<br>
[0027] The fuel cell assembly 200 may include a border or frame (not shown). In<br>
particular embodiments, the frame holds the unitized plate 400. The frame can<br>
be constructed from a number of suitable materials including, but not limited to,<br>
dielectric materials such as rigid thermoplastics, thermosets, elastomers, and<br>
thermoplastic elastomers. In particular embodiments, the frame is integral with at<br>
least one of the headers 406 and the electrically insulating dividers 408. It may<br><br>
be further desirable to mold an integral seal to the unitized plates 400, for<br>
example, via the frame. The integral seal may be formed by a molding process<br>
known in the art.<br>
[0028] The headers 406 may include a plurality of inlet apertures 410 and a<br>
plurality of outlet apertures 412 that define a plurality of inlet manifolds and a<br>
plurality of outlet manifolds, respectively, when the fuel cell assembly 200 is fully<br>
assembled. In another embodiment, the inlet and outlet apertures 410,412 are<br>
formed in the border or frame. In one embodiment, the headers 406 include a<br>
seal integrally formed thereon.<br>
[0029] The inlet and outlet apertures 410, 412 correspond substantially to the<br>
inlet and outlet apertures 72, 74, 76, 78. It should be appreciated that each fuel<br>
cell stack 2 unit receives a supply of reactants via dedicated supply manifolds<br>
formed by the inlet apertures 410. The fuel cell stack 2 formed with the unitized<br>
plates 400 are thereby independently operable.<br>
[0030] In a particular embodiment, each of the active regions 402, 404 is in fluid<br>
communication with a dedicated inlet aperture 410. The inlet apertures 410 are<br>
thereby adapted to selectively deliver gaseous reactants, such as air and<br>
hydrogen, as desired to the active regions 402, 404. Each of the plurality of<br>
active regions 402, 404 may further be in fluid communication with a dedicated<br>
outlet aperture 412. In an illustrative embodiment, the individual inlet aperture<br>
410 delivers the gaseous reactants to one of the active regions 402. The<br>
individual outlet aperture 412 may be adapted to independently receive an<br>
exhaust stream from the individual active region 402.<br>
[0031] A skilled artisan should appreciate that the fuel cell assembly 200 may be<br>
adjusted to a desired voltage by limiting a supply of gaseous reactants to a<br>
portion of the fuel cell stacks 2 formed with the unitized plates 400. For example,<br>
gaseous reactants may be selectively provided to some fuel cell stacks 2 and not<br>
provided to other fuel cell stacks 2 formed by the unitized plates 400. For<br>
example, when one fuel cell stack 2 unit becomes inoperable or begins to exhibit<br>
an undesirable performance, the gaseous reactants may be directed away from<br>
the inoperable unit and the supply to the other units adjusted accordingly.<br><br>
[0032] Similarly, one of ordinary skill should appreciated that the unitized plates<br>
400, having the inlet apertures 410 adapted to selectively deliver gaseous<br>
reactants to the active regions 402, 404, enables operational strategies such as<br>
flow shifting and stack order switching, for example. Flow shifting involves an<br>
alternating flow of gaseous reactants through a first stack and a second stack<br>
connected in series, wherein a direction of the flow through the stacks alternates.<br>
Stack order switching involves an alternating flow of gaseous reactants through<br>
the first stack to the second stack connected in series, wherein the direction of<br>
flow through the fuel cell stacks 2 remains constant. These methods of operating<br>
the fuel cell stacks 2 may facilitate moisture control and optimize an operability of<br>
the fuel cell stacks 2.<br>
[0033] As further shown in FIG. 4, a single, unitized MEA 414 may have a<br>
plurality of catalyst regions 416, 418 that form the anodes and cathodes of the<br>
fuel cell stack 2 units. The plurality of catalyst regions 416, 418 may be<br>
separated by an electrolyte membrane, with the catalyst regions 416, 418 applied<br>
by a patch coating process, for example. In another embodiment, the MEA 414<br>
has the catalyst disposed substantially evenly along a length of the MEA 414<br>
surfaces, with the catalyst regions 416, 418 being formed by openings in a matrix<br>
or screen layer bonded to the MEA 414 surfaces. The matrix or screen layer is<br>
disposed over the catalyst and has openings that expose and define the<br>
boundaries of the catalyst regions 416,418. The matrix or screen may be<br>
formed from a dielectric material as described herein. Other suitable means for<br>
applying the catalyst regions 416, 418 may be used as desired.<br>
[0034] The unitized MEA 414 is configured for assembly with the unitized plates<br>
400. The unitized plate 400 is generally disposed between a pair of the unitized<br>
MEAs 414. As a nonlimiting example, the catalyst regions 416,418 are aligned<br>
with and adapted to abut the active regions 402, 404 of the unitized plate 400<br>
when the unitized plate 400 and the unitized MEA 414 are arranged in the fuel<br>
cell assembly 200.<br>
[0035] One of ordinary skill in the art should understand that the unitized plates<br>
400 and the unitized MEAs 414 form a plurality of independently functioning fuel<br><br><br>
cell stacks 2 when assembled. Thus, the fuel cell stacks 2 formed with the<br>
unitized plates 400 may be operated substantially independently of one another<br>
by controlling a flow of the gaseous reactants to the fuel cell stacks 2. The<br>
independent fuel cell stacks 2 formed from the unitized plates 400 and the MEAs<br>
414 may also be electrically linked in series to provide a desired voltage.<br>
[0036] In a typical fuel cell assembly, a voltage converter (not shown) is<br>
employed to boost the electrical voltage of the fuel cell stack. In the present<br>
invention, the plurality of fuel cell stacks 2 units connected in series form a fuel<br>
cell assembly 200 wherein a voltage generated is maximized. In a particular<br>
embodiment, the fuel cell assembly 200 may be constructed with a plurality of the<br>
unitized plates 400 and a plurality of the MEAs 414. For example, the active<br>
regions 402, 404 are electrically connected in series to boost the electrical<br>
voltage of the fuel cell assembly 200 in accordance with Ohm's Law. As a further<br>
nonlimiting example, one 230-cell stack with about 800 cm2 of active area per<br>
cell may be replaced by three 200-cell stacks with about 300 cm2 of active area<br>
per cell. A skilled artisan should thereby understand that a single fuel cell stack<br>
having a voltage converter to boost the electrical voltage can be replaced by the<br>
fuel cell assembly 200 of the present disclosure. It should further be understood<br>
that constructing the fuel cell assembly 200 from the unitized plates 400 and the<br>
unitized MEAs 414 minimizes a complexity thereof.<br>
[0037] The present disclosure further includes a method for operating the fuel cell<br>
assembly 200. In one embodiment, the method includes the steps of providing<br>
the fuel cell assembly 200 as described herein with the plurality of fuel cell stacks<br>
2 formed with the unitized plates 400. Each of the fuel cell stacks 2 of the<br>
assembly 200 is adapted to receive a supply of gaseous reactants. The fuel cell<br>
stacks 2 are then connected in electrical series. The gaseous reactants may be<br>
selectively supplied to each of the plurality of fuel cell stacks 2 as desired. For<br>
example, the gaseous reactants may be selectively supplied to adjust the voltage<br>
to a desired level. In other embodiments, the gaseous reactants may be<br>
selectively supplied according to one or more operational strategies, such as<br>
stack order switching, as previously described herein. It should be understood<br><br>
that other suitable operational strategies may be employed with the fuel cell<br>
assembly 200 of the disclosure by selectively supplying the gaseous reactants to<br>
one or more of the plurality of fuel cell stacks 2.<br>
[0038] While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown<br>
for purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art that various changes may be made without departing from the scope of the<br>
disclosure, which is further described in the following appended claims.<br><br><br>
