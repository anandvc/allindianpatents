				<td>METHOD, TERMINAL AND RADIO NETWORK CONTROLLER FOR SEARCHING FOR THE SINGLE FREQUENCY NETWORK CLUSTER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the field of communication, and particularly to a method, User Equipment and Radio Network Controller for searching for a Broadcast and/or Multicast Single Frequency Network cluster.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] At present, a new special frame structure has been adopted at the physical layer in a base station to bear a Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (MBMS) in the prior art, to further improve a transmission rate of the MBMS service in the 3GPP release 7.10<br>
[0003] A schematic diagram of the special frame structure is shown in Figure 1, and the frame structure includes one short slot and seven traffic slots, all of which are used for downlink transmission and transmitted in all directions. The short slot in the fiume structure combines three special slots in the traditional frame structure, i.e. DwPTS, UpPTS and GP, into one slot with a length of 0.275ms, and is used for transmitting a new type of burst data, such as transmission control information and the like. Figure 2 shows the structure of the short slot, which includes a channel estimation code (i.e. a preamble) of 96 chips and data symbols of 256 chips. The seven traffic slots in the frame structure are used for transmitting the MBMS service. The structure of the traffic slot is shown in Figure 3, and the traffic slot includes a channel estimation code (i.e. a preamble) of 96 chips and data symbols of 768 chips.<br>
[0004] To ensure the compatibility with the existing system, i.e. to maintain the structure of slots in the existing traditional frame structure imchanged, another new frame structure is also adopted at the physical layer in the base station in the prior art to bear the MBMS service, and has a structure as shown illustratively in Figure 4, which includes 3 idle slots, 1 slot TSO and 6 traffic slots TS1-TS6. All of the slot TSO and the slots TS1-TS6 are used for downlink transmission, while the three idle slots between the slot TSO and slot TSl are used for neither downlink transmission nor uplink transmission. [0005]   Based on the above two frame structures at the physical layer described above, when a<br>
 <br>
Node B is instructed by a Radio Network Controller (RNC) to establish an MBMS over Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) cluster, two types of MBSFN clusters may be established, one of which is an MBSFN cluster where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the first physical layer frame structure described above, and the other is an MBSFN cluster where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the second physical layer frame structure described above.<br>
[0006] In the prior art, there is neither a method for searching for a desired MBSFN cluster from the MBSFN clusters where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the above-described two types of physical layer frame structures, nor a method for receiving the MBMS service from the searched out MBSFN cluster, as a result, a User Equipment (UE) can receive the MBMS service from neither of the above-described two types of MBSFN clusters.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
[0022] According an embodiment of the present invention, a UE is synchronized with a non-MBSFN cell associated with an MBSFN cluster and searches for a corresponding MBSFN cluster according to indication of system information in the non-MBSFN cell, subsequently, the UE is synchronized with the searched out MBSFN cluster, and receives an MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the UE.<br>
[0023] In an embodiment of the invention, an RNC notifies a Node B about an operation frequency and type of an MBSFN cluster when instructing the Node B to establish the MBSFN cluster, and notifies the Node B about the configuration of a Cell Parameter ID in the short slot or slot TSO according to the type of the MBSFN cluster, as well as the configuration of a Cell<br>
 <br>
Parameter ID in a traffic slot, however, it will be appreciated that the Cell Parameter ID in the traffic slot may be also configured when the common transmission channel is established. In the case of the first type of MBSFN cluster, i.e. the MBSFN cluster where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the first physical layer frame structure described above, the Cell Parameter ID in the short slot may be a code block ID allocated for the short slot in first type of MBSFN cluster by the RNC; and in the case of the second type of MBSFN cluster, i.e. the MBSFN cluster where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the second physical layer frame structure described above, the Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO may be a code block ID allocated for the slot TSO in second type of MBSFN cluster by the RNC.<br>
[0024]   The RNC needs fiirther to configure the channels in the MBSFN cluster as follows.<br>
[0025] The channels in the first type of MBSFN cluster may be such configured that an MBMS point-to-multipoint transport channel (MTCH) is configured in the traffic slot, a Broadcast control channel (BCCH) and an MBMS point-to-muhipoint control channel (MCCH) are primarily configured in the short slot, a Multiplex Subchannel (MSCH) or an MBMS notification identification channel (MICH) for the purpose of Discontinuous Reception (DRX) of the MBMS service may be further configured in the short slot, and the remaining charmel resources in the short slot may be further used for bearing MTCH channel.<br>
[0026] The channels in the second type of MBSFN cluster may be such configured that MTCH channels are configured in the traffic slots TS1-TS6, a BCCH channel and an MCCH channel are configured in the slot TSO, an MSCH chaimel or an MICH channel for the purpose of the DRX of the MBMS service is further configured in the slot TSO, and the remaining charmel resources in the slot TSO may be used for bearing the MTCH channel.<br>
[0027] As can be seen from the above channel configuration, a synchronization channel is configured for neither of the above two types of MBSFN clusters by the RNC. Therefore, to enable the UE to receive the MBMS service from the MBSFN clusters, in the embodiment of the present invention, the UE is synchronized with a non-MBSFN cell associated with an MBSFN cluster and searches for the MBSFN cluster associated with the non-MBSFN cell according to indication of system information in the non-MBSFN cell, subsequently, the UE is synchronized with the searched out MBSFN cluster, and receives an MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the UE. Therefore, the non-MBSFN cell and the<br>
 <br>
MBSFN clusters are required to be associated with each other in the embodiment of the invention in a manner that an association table is provided in the RNC through an operation and maintenance platform so that the non-MBSFN cell is associated with the MBSFN chisters.<br>
[0028] Referring to Figure 5, a diagram of the architecture including a non-MBSFN cell and the two types of MBSFN clusters is shown, and it is desired to receive an MBMS service of one of the two types of MBSFN clusters (usually, the MBMS services transmitted in the MBSFN clusters are different from each other) via a UE in the coverage of a non-MBSFN cell. The implementation of receiving the MBMS service of one of the two types of MBSFN clusters by the UE in the coverage of a non-MBSFN cell is described in detail with reference to Tables 1 and 2 below.<br>
[0029] For example, the correspondence relationship between the non-MBSFN cell and the associated MBSFN clusters is shown in Table 1, and information of the MBSFN clusters is shown in Table 2.<br>
 <br>
[0030] For example, a plurality of MBMS services are initiated at the network side and the RNC is notified of the MBMS services through signaling. The RNC transmits one of the MBMS services through the first type of MBSFN cluster shown in Table 1 and the other of the MBMS services through the second type of MBSFN chister shown in Table 1; fiirther, it is<br>
 <br>
desired to receive the MBMS service from the second type of MBSFN cluster by a UE in the coverage of the non-MBSFN cell 1. In this case, as shown in Figure 6, the implementation of receiving the MBMS service from the second type of MBSFN cluster by the UE in the coverage of the non-MBSFN cell 1 is as follows.<br>
[0031] SIO: An association table as shown in Table 1 is provided in the RNC through an operation and maintenance platform. The Association table associates the non-MBSFN cell 1 with the first and second types of MBSFN clusters. Further, an table of information of the MBSFN clusters is provided in the RNC through the operation and maintenance platform as shown in Table 2, and contains: information of the type, frequency and Cell Parameter ID in the short slot of the first t)pe of MBSFN cluster and information of the type, frequency and Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0032] Further, the Cell Parameter- IDs in the respective traffic slots in the MBSFN clusters need to be configured by the RNC according to properties of the Single Frequency Network.<br>
[0033] S20: During the network operation, the RNC broadcasts system information SIB 11 within the non-MBSFN cell 1 through the Node B, and the system information SIB 11 contains information from the information table of the MBSFN clusters configured by the RNC, that is, the RNC broadcasts the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the short slot or slot TSO of the MBSFN cluster associated with the non-MBSFN cell 1 within the non-MBSFN cell 1 through the Node B.<br>
[0034] Further, the RNC broadcasts system information SIB3, SIB5 and SIB 11 within the first type of MBSFN cluster through the Node B. The system information SIB3 contains information indicating the type of the MBSFN cluster; the system information SIB5 contains information of an MCCH channel of the MBSFN cluster and Cell Parameter IDs used for the respective traffic slots; and the system information SIB 11 contains information from the information table of the MBSFN clusters, which includes the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the short slot of the first type of MBSFN cluster and the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0035] Further, the RNC broadcasts system information SIB3, SIB5 and SIB 11 within the second type of MBSFN cluster through the Node B. The system information SIB3 contains information indicating the type of the MBSFN cluster; the system information SIB5 contains<br>
 <br>
information of an MCCH channel of the MBSFN cluster and Cell Parameter IDs used for the respective traffic slots; and the system information SIB 11 contains information from the information table of the MBSFN clusters, which includes the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the short slot of the first type of MBSFN cluster and the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0036] S30: The UE in the coverage of the non-MBSFN cell 1 is synchronized with the non-MBSFN cell 1 by receiving a synchronization signal of a normal carrier network. After the synchronization, the UE receives the system information SIB 11 of the non-MBSFN cell 1, and obtains information of the first and second types of MBSFN clusters associated with the non-MBSFN cell 1 (i.e. the type, frequency information and Cell Parameter ID in the short slot or slot TSO of the MBSFN clusters associated with the non-MBSFN cell 1) from the received system information SIB 11.<br>
[0037] S40: According to the service selection predetermined by the user, for example, if it is desired to receive the MBMS service of the second type of MBSFN cluster via the UE, the UE is synchronized with the second type of MBSFN cluster; then the UE searches for a corresponding MBSFN cluster according to the Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO of the second type of the MBSFN cluster which is obtained from the system information SIBU received from , the non-MBSFN celll.<br>
[0038] Here, the process of searching for the MBSFN cluster using the Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO by the UE includes that: the UE receives wireless signals at the operation frequencies of the MBSFN clusters; the UE determines whether the Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO matches the received wireless signals at the operation frequencies of the MBSFN clusters, and in the present embodiment, the Cell Parameter ID matches successfully with the received wireless signal at the operation frequency of the second type of MBSFN cluster, but mismatches with the received wireless signals at the operation frequencies of other MBSFN clusters; then the UE determines the wireless signal at the operation frequency of the second type of MBSFN cluster as the target signal to receive, and searches for the corresponding MBSFN cluster according to the obtained Cell Parameter ID in the slot TSO of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0039]   As can be seen from the above, when the information of the MBSFN clusters obtained<br>
 <br>
by the UE corresponds to at least two MBSFN clusters, the UE may determine the MBSFN to be searched for in such a manner that the UE determines the MBSFN cluster to be searched for according to the preset service selection made by the user and then searches for the corresponding MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0040] Furthermore, the UE may determine the MBSFN cluster to be searched for in another manner that the UE determines the MBSFN cluster to be searched for according to its supported frame structure used for transmitting the MBMS service and then searches for the corresponding MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0041] As shown in the above processing, the UE is synchronized with a non-MBSFN cell associated with an MBSFN cluster, and searches for the corresponding MBSFN cluster according to indication of system information in the non-MBSFN cell in synchronization with the UE, thereby enabling the UE to search for the corresponding MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0042] S50: The UE is synchronized with the searched out second type of MBSFN cluster; after the UE is synchronization with the second type of MBSFN cluster, the UE receives the system information SIB3, SIB5 and SIB 11 of the second type of MBSFN cluster by demodulating the information in the Cell Parameter ID (i.e. code block ID) in the slot TSO of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0043] Here, if the UE determines that the wireless signal at the operation frequency of the second type of MBSFN cluster as the target signal for receiving, and receives wireless signals at the operation frequency of the second type of MBSFN cluster only, without receiving wireless signals at the operation frequency of the other MBSFN clusters, the UE has been successfully synchronized with the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0044] S60: UE verifies the type of the current MBSFN cluster, i.e. verifying that the current MBSFN cluster is the second type of MBSFN cluster, according to the received system information SIB3 of the second type of MBSFN cluster, and obtains MCCH channel information and Cell Parameter ID information of the traffic slot of the second type of MBSFN cluster according to the received system information SIB5.<br>
[0045] Further, the UE jumps to the MCCH channel according to the obtained MCCH channel information of the second type of MBSFN cluster, receives the Radio Bearer (RB)<br>
 <br>
information and related traffic channel information transmitted in the MCCH channel according to the interested service, and obtains information of a specific chaimel for transmitting the MBMS service in the second type of MBSFN cluster according to the received traffic channel information.<br>
[0046] S70: According to the obtained information of the specific channel for transmitting the MBMS service in the second type of MBSFN cluster and the obtained Cell Parameter ID information, the UE receives the MBMS service transmitted over the channel of the second type of MBSFN cluster by demodulating the contents in the Cell Parameter ID of the traffic slot of the second type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0047] As shown in the above processing, by synchronizing with the searched out MBSFN cluster and receiving the MBMS service of the MBSFN cluster, the UE is enabled to receive the MBMS service in the MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0048] In the above implementation, the UE in the coverage of the non-MBSFN cell 1 may receive the MBMS service in the second type of MBSFN cluster; likewise, the UE in the coverage of the non-MBSFN cell 1 may also receive the MBMS service in the first type of MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0049] As shown in Figure 7, the structure of a User Equipment according to an embodiment of the invention may include:<br>
[0050] a first synchronization unit 10, which is adapted to synchronize with a non-MBSFN cell associated with the MBSFN clusters described above when the User Equipment is required to receive an MBMS service from one of the MBSFN clusters;<br>

[0053] an MBMS service receiving unit 40, which is adapted to receive the MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the second synchronization unit 30.<br>
[0054]   The searching unit 20 may include:<br>
 <br>
[0055] an information obtaining subunit 21, which is adapted to obtain information of an MBSFN cluster associated with the non-MBSFN cell in synchronization with the first synchronization unit from system broadcast information of the non-MBSFN cell; and<br>
[0056] a searching subunit 22, which is adapted to search for a corresponding MBSFN cluster using the information of the MBSFN cluster obtained by the information obtaining subunit 21.<br>
[0057] The searching subunit 22 searches for the corresponding MBSFN cluster by matching a code block ID in the obtained information of an MBSFN cluster with a wkeless signal received at the operation frequency of the MBSFN cluster.<br>
[0058]   The MBMS service receiving unit 40 may include:<br>
[0059] a system broadcast information receiving subunit 41, which is adapted to receive system broadcast information of the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the second synchronization unit 30;<br>
[0060] a control channel information obtaining subunit 42, which is adapted to obtain information of a MBMS point-to-multipoint control charmel from the system broadcast information received by the system broadcast information receiving subunit 41;<br>
[0061] a slot information obtaining subunit 43, which is adapted to obtain information of a slot used for transmitting the MBMS service from the system broadcast information received by the system broadcast information receiving subunit 41;<br>
[0062] a traffic channel information obtaining subunit 44, which is adapted to jump to a corresponding control channel to obtain information of a traffic charmel for transmitting the MBMS service, according to information of the MBMS point-to-multipoint control channel obtained by the control channel information obtaining subunit 42; and<br>
[0063] a MBMS service receiving subunit 45, which is adapted to receive the MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the UE, according to the information of the slot used for transmitting the MBMS service obtained by the slot information obtaining subunit 43 and the information of the traffic channel for transmitting the MBMS service obtained by the traffic channel information obtaining subunit 44.<br>

 <br>
non-MBSFN cell and an MBSFN cluster; and an information distribution control unit, which is adapted to control a corresponding non-MBSFN cell to carry, in the distributed system broadcast information, information of the MBSFN cluster associated with the non-MBSFN cell, according to the association information stored in the storage unit.<br>
[0065] In the invention, the UE is synchronized with the non-MBSFN cell associated with the MBSFN cluster and searches for a corresponding MBSFN cluster according to indication of system information in the non-MBSFN cell in synchronization with the UE, subsequently, the UE is synchronized with the searched out MBSFN cluster, and receives the MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster in synchronization with the UE. Therefore, the embodiments of the present invention provide a method for searching for a desired MBSFN cluster from the proposed MBSFN clusters where the MBMS service is transmitted based on the above-described two types of physical layer frame structures, and a method for receiving the MBMS service from the searched out MBSFN cluster, thereby enabling the UE to receive the MBMS service from the MBSFN cluster.<br>
