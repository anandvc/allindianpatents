Since this constitution of the p rt 107 c n reduce the therm l conduction from the upper p rt 121 he ted by   he ter to the cylindric l body 108 of the p rt 107 for injecting the fo m mixture into the c vity 102, it is possible to keep the temper ture of the cylindric l body 108 of the p rt 107<br>
12<br><br>
lower th n th t of the upper p rt 121.<br>
On the other h nd, the  mount of the fo m mixture in the cylindric l body 108 of the p rt 107 is less th n th t in the upper p rt 121. Thus, it is possible to h rden the fo m mixture in the cylindric l body 108  nd in the upper p rt 121  t the s me r te by controlling the temper ture of the cylindric l body 108 to be lower th n th t of the upper p rt 121.<br>
Therefore, the problem of the fo m mixture in the cylindric l body 108 being overhe ted c n be solved.<br>
