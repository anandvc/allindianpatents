				<td>The present invention relates to an electrokinetic delivery device.<br>
1.        Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates generally to the transdermal electrokinetic mass transfer of medication into a diseased tissue, and, more specifically, to a portable apparatus for the iontophoretic delivery of medication across the skin and incorporation of the medication into diseased tissues and blood vessels adjacent to the delivery site. The apparatus provides a new method for treating and managing disease presenting cutaneous lesions.<br>
2.        Prior Art:<br>
Iontophoresis has been employed for several centuries as a means for applying medication locally through a patient's skin and for delivering medicaments to the eyes and ears. The application of an electric field to the skin is known to greatly enhance the skin's permeability to various ionic agents. The use of iontophoretic transdermal delivery techniques has obviated the need for hypodermic injection for many medicaments, thereby eliminating the concomitant problems of trauma, pain and risk of infection to the patient.<br>
Iontophoresis involves the application of an electromotive force to drive or repel oppositely charged ions through the dermal layers into a target tissue. Particularly suitable target tissue include tissues adjacent to the delivery site for localized treatment or tissues remote therefrom in which case the medicament enters into the circulatory system and is transported to a tissue by the blood. Positively charged ions are driven into the skin at an anode while negatively charged ions are driven into the skin at a cathode. Studies have shown increased skin penetration of drugs at anodic or cathodic electrodes regardless of the predominant molecular ionic charge on the drug. This effect is mediated by polarization and osmotic effects.<br>
Regardless of the charge of the medicament to be administered, a iontophoretic delivery device employs two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) in conjunction with the<br><br>
patient's skin to form a closed circuit between one of the electrodes (referred to herein alternatively as a "working" or "application" or "applicator" electrode) which is positioned at the delivered site of drug delivery and a passive or "grounding" electrode affixed to a second site on the skin to enhance the rate of penetration of the medicament into the skin adjacent to the applicator electrode.<br>
Recent interest in the use of iontophoresis for delivering drugs through a patient's skin to a desired treatment site has stimulated a redesign of many of such drugs with concomitant increased efficacy of the drugs when delivered transdermally. As iontophoretic delivery of medicaments become more widely used, the opportunity for a consumer/patient to iontophoretically administer a transdermal dosage of medicaments simply and safely at non-medical or non-professional facilities would be desirable and practical. Similarly, when a consumer/patient travels, it would be desirable to have a personal, easily transportable apparatus available which is operable for the iontophoretic transdermal delivery of a medication packaged in a single dosage applicator. The present invention provides a portable iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus and a unit-dosage medicament-containing applicator electrode which is disposable and adapted for use with the apparatus for self-administering medicament.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses a portable iontophoretic transdermal or transmucoscal medicament delivery apparatus and a unit dosage medicament applicator electrode adapted for use with the apparatus for the self-administration of a unit dose of a medicament into the skin. The apparatus is particularly suited for the localized treatment of herpes infections. Recurrent herpetic infections (fever blisters or herpes labialis) are very common and usually involve the mucocutaneous juncture. The established treatment for recurrent herpetic lesions (oral or genital) has been primarily supportive; including local topical application of anesthesia. Severe cases have been treated with systemic Acyclovir® (Zovirax Burroughs-Wellcome). Some cases the condition is managed with prophylactic long-term dosing administration with a suitable anitviral agent at great expense. Systemic treatment of acute herpetic flare-ups may reduce the normal 10-12 day course of cutaneous symptoms into a 6-8<br>
day episode. Topical treatment of lesions with Acyclovir® has not been as effective as in vitro studies would suggest. A compound which is not presently available to clinicians but has demonstrated significant anti herpetic activity is 5-iodo-2 deoxyuridine (IUDR). Both of those agents have shown limited clinical efficacy when applied topically to the herpetic lesion. It is the present inventor's contention that the limited efficacy of topical administration previously observed is, at least in part, due to the poor skin penetration of these medicaments when applied topically. The present invention provides improved transdermal delivery of these medicaments,and demonstrates improved clinical results in the case of Herpes.<br>
Oral Herpes (most commonly Herpes simplex I infection) as well as genital Herpes (usually Herpes Simplex II infection) afflict many people, cause discomfort, shame, and may contribute to more severe and costly illnesses such as cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and perinatal blindness from herpetic conjunctivitis. The present invention discloses a portable, user-friendly transdermal delivery device and a method for using the device with Acyclovir® (or similar antiviral agent) to greatly benefit these afflicted patients. The present inventor has constructed embodiments of this device and conducted human clinical trials which clearly demonstrate improved therapeutic efficacy using iontophoretically administered antiviral agents when compared to unassisted topical application of the agent.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an iontophoretic medica'ment delivery apparatus which is portable and operable for self-administration of medicament into the skin of a person.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved iontophoretic transdermal drub delivery apparatus having a medicament-containing application electrode which disperses a single dosage and is disposable and non-reusable.<br>
It is a feature of the present invention that the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus is easily maneuverable and operable when hand-held.<br>
It is another feature of the present invention that the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus is battery powered and conveniently transported by a person.<br>
It is a further feature of the present invention that the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus employs a tactile electrode which is in electrical contact with the skin of a user's hand when the apparatus is held in the user's hand, obviating the need for a separate<br>
grounding electrode connector or wire.<br>
It is still another feature of the present invention that the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus is adapted to be operable with a disposable medicament ^containing applicator electrode which applicator electrode includes an absorbent, inert, non-corrosive portion containing a therapeutic agent.<br>
It is yet another feature of the present invention to provide an embodiment of an iontophoretic transdermal delivery device wherein the disposable iontophoretic medicament-containing applicator electrode is adapted for releasable attachment to use with a hand-held base assembly housing a grounding electrode.<br>
It is yet another feature of the present invention that the disposable iontophoretic medicament applicator electrode include indicator means operable for enabling a user to determine when the medicament within the removable applicator electrode has been released in delivery and/or depleted.<br>
It is yet another feature of the present invention that the circuitry employed in the disposable iontophoretic medicament applicator include current limiting means operable for limiting the electrical current flowing between the surface of the applicator and the skin to less than about one milliampere per square centimeters of application electrode skin-contacting surface.<br>
It is another advantage of the present invention that the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus employs a disposable application electrode which conducts the electrical current to the tissue through the solution in which the medicament is dissolved.<br>
It is still another advantage of the present invention that the improved disposable iontophoretic medicament applicator is inexpensive, safe to use and greatly increases the therapeutic efficacy of a medicament administered thereby.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the present invention provides a means for topically administering medicament directly and with high efficiency into a diseased tissue thereby providing a novel method for treating clinical conditions presenting mucocutaneous symptoms and particularly mucocutaneous Herpes Simplex viral eruptions and sequelle associated therewith.<br>
The above objects, features and advantages of the invention are realized by the<br>
improved monopolar iontophoretic medicament applicator which is easily transportable. The applicator employs a detachable medicament containing application electrode. The objects, features and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed disclosure of the invention, especially when it is taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an electrokinetic delivery device for personal use and self-administration of a medicament to an individual's treatment site, comprising:<br>
a base assembly having a portion thereof shaped for manual manipulation by the hand of the individual, and a tactile electrode formed of electrically conductive material and exposed on said base assembly for electrical contact with the individual's hand;<br>
a self-contained power source within said base assembly and in electrical contact with said tactile electrode;<br>
an applicator electrode carried by said assembly, said applicator electrode being in electrical contact with said power source and having a porous substrate including an electrokinetically transportable medicament, said porous substrate having a surface for contact with the individual's treatment site;<br>
said device being operable to electrokinetically transport said medicament from said applicator electrode to the individual's treatment site in contact with said surface in response to completion of an electrical circuit with said power source via at least a portion of the individual's hand through said tactile electrode and said applicator electrode surface and the individual's treatment site.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a side elevational plan view of the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus showing the circumferential tactile ground electrode on the outer surface of the I  base housing and a disposable iontophoretic application electrode;<br>
FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the disposable non-reusable iontophoretic application electrode with a portion broken away to view the medicament dose packet;<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
FIG 1 shows, in side elevation, a preferred embodiment of the hand-held iontophoretic transdermal medicament delivery apparatus of the present invention.     The apparatus, indicated generally by the numeral 10, has an elongate base assembly 1.1 the major portion of which is preferably formed of plastic and shaped to conform to and comfortably fit within a users hand. An applicator electrode module 12, containing a unit dosejDf medicament 23, is releasably attached to a applicator electrode receptacle 14 on the distal end of the base assembly 11. The application electrode 12 is preferably a "clip-on" type of electrode similar in configuration to an electrocardiogram electrode.   In the drawing presented in Figures 1 and 2, electrically conductive elements such as wires and busses are presented as heavy lines. A wire 16 provides electrical connection between the applicator electrode receptacle 14 and wire 18 within tne neck 15 of the base assembly 11. Connecting wire 18, in turn, provides electrical connection between the wire 16 and the current driver unit 19 housed within the base assembly 11.   A conductive tactile electrode 20 forms a portion of the exterior skin-contacting surface of the base assembly 11 preferably circumferentially enclosing a portion. of the base housing or it may be interrupted or discontinuous on the outer surface.   The tactile electrode 20 is in electrical communication with the cathode 24C of battery 24 by<br>
means of a buss 17 and conductive urging spring 25 which secures the battery in position within the base assembly 11. For the self-administration of medicament a user must have skin contact with the tactile electrode 20 for the unit to operate. Current driver 19 underlies the cathodic (ground) tactile electrode 20 and is electrically connected via wire 21 to a voltage multiplier 22. The voltage multiplier 22 receives low voltage power from the anode 24a of the battery power source 24 and increases the available voltage for presentation to the application electrode 12. The battery 24 is preferably a size A A or AAA. Battery 24 is held in place by an electrically conductive biasing spring 25 and ensures that electrical power is available at the application electrode 12 when the user grasps and holds the base housing 11 of the apparatus 10 thereby touching the cathodic tactile electrode 20. The application electrode 12 and the tactile electrode 20 thus form a closed circuit in series with the user's skin.<br>
When current flows across the user's skin to the application electrode in response to an applied voltage the current promotes and hastens the penetration of the medicament 23 contained in a reservoir 26 within the working electrode 12 into the skin. The polarity of the working electrode 12 is preferably unidirectional to promote the above described penetration without requiring a separate grounding electrode. The working application electrode 12 will be described in greater detail below.<br>
The base assembly 11 of apparatus 10 serves as a housing to the aforesaid components as a handle. The portion of the base assembly 11, exclusive of the tactile electrode, is preferably made of a plastic such as polyethylene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene or similar durable plastic. The battery portion 24 is connected to a voltage multiplier 22 which steps up the voltage supplied by the battery 24 and applies the stepped up voltage to the current driver 19. Current driver 19 presents a defined current and voltage output at the application electrode 12 the value of the current, which may be empirically determined being sufficient to drive the medicament through the porous, open-celled material 27 (Figure 2) within the application electrode interposed between the skin contacting surface 13 and reservoir 26 containing the unit dose medicament and penetrate the patient's skin. The circuitry limits the maximum current available to the application electrode to preferably to less than about one milliampere per two square centimeters of the skin-contacting surface area 13 of the<br>
application electrode 12. However, depending upon working electrode's 12 skin-contacting surface 13 configuration, the current level can vary from about 0.1 to about 1.2 milliamps. Currents ranging between . 1 ma to 5 ma have been used clinically by the present inventor, but the higher currents caused the user minor discomfort and, with chronic use over time, may produce untoward effects.<br>
FIG 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the iontophoretic medicament-containing application electrode 12. The application electrode 12 is preferably disposable and non-reusable and is suitable, for example, for transdermally delivering antiviral agents such as Acyclovir® for the treatment of cold sores or genital herpes. The size of the skin-contacting surface 13 of application electrode 12 may vary to accommodate specific clinical applications. The application electrode 12 is detachably housed within a recess within the receptacle 14 which recess presents an electrically conductive interior surface to complete the electrical flow path from the connecting wires 18 and 16 to a conductive element 29 within the application electrode. The electrical current from the current driver 19 is conducted through conductive inner surface of the application electrode receptacle 14 to the electrically conductive element 29 within the applicator electrode which element 29 is in electrical contact with the inner surface of the receptacle in contact therewith to drive the medicament 23 or treatment agent through the open-celled sponge-like matrix material 27 and through the user's skin (not shown). The medicament or treatment agent 23 is contained within a rupturable polymer reservoir 26 until dispensed during treatment. A slight exertion of pressure or squeezing of the reservoir 26 against reservoir puncture means 28 releases the medicament or treatment agent into an open-celled sponge-like material 27 within the application electrode for iontophoretic delivery into the patient's skin. Medicament 23 release can occur at the time of application or upon peruse compression of the electrode 12. Application electrode 12 can be advantageously designed to include a stripping portion adapted so that upon removal of the application electrode 12 from the electrode receptacle 14 a protruding stripping portion (not shown) scrapingly strips the conductive coating from the conductive support arm 29 to prevent reuse of the disposable electrode 12. Application electrode 12 is intentionally packaged with a single dose packet or reservoir 26 of treatment agent or medicament 23. In addition to the medicament, the reservoir 26 can include a<br>
coloring agent, such as iodine, which turns dark blue upon contact with starch in the open-celled material to visibly indicate that the unit dose encapsulation has been used. Other suitable coloring agents can include pH indicators, wet saturation indicators or oxidizable pigments.<br>
The open-celled sponge-like material 27 surrounding reservoir 26 should be inert to the medicament or treatment agent being employed, as well as being non-corrosive and stable when in contact with the treatment agent. Suitable materials include plastic pads, such as polyethylene, paper or cotton, porous ceramics, open-celled porous polytetrafluoroethylene, polyurethane and other inert plastics, and open-celled silicone rubber, such as may be employed with vertically aligned medicament-containing tubes. A typical medicament that can be contained within the rupturable polymer reservoir 26 is xylocaine or similar topical anesthetic.<br>
The disposable electrode 12 possesses the advantages of preventing leaching or migration of the medicament from within the rupturable polymer reservoir, no attendant loss of efficacy, a long shelf life and little or no electrode corrosion. A suitable electrical control circuit for use in the iontophoretic medicament delivery apparatus 12 is shown in U.S. Patent Application, Serial No. 07/157,799, filed September 10, 1990, now US Patent 5,160,316 and hereby specifically incorporated by reference herein in pertinent part.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL CLINICAL TRIALS<br>
The inventor has conducted a clinical study using a prototype iontophoretic device in accordance with the present invention for the treatment of cold sores. The clinical response was promising. A second independent, qualified investigator, a board-certified Urologist, conducted a study using the present apparatus and method for treating male genital herpes lesions with encouraging results. Table 1 summarizes data (discussed below) supporting the claim to unexpected clinical benefits treating disease with this novel method. The method and medicament application device when used together for treating these common, embarrassing, and previously not easily-treatable ailments provide surprising advantages.<br>
The embodiment Ic of the device described hereinabove is a improvement over the prototype used in the clinical study, which was a larger unit, not user friendly, which<br>
required physically connecting wires to the patient's body which created anxiety, and could not be used without attending personnel. Notwithstanding design, the apparatus used in the clinical study summarized in Table 1 employed electronics similar to the apparatus described herein and was used to optimize the clinical performance of the embodiment 12 of the device described herein.<br>
TABLE 1 STAGE I TREATMENT RESULTS(Table Removed)<br>
The study included a control situation wherein seven patients were found who had simultaneous concurrent herpes lesions at separate locations on their bodies. In each case one lesion was treated with iontophoretic application of antiviral agent (Acyclovir® or IUDR) and the other lesion was treated in the standard method employed in the prior art comprising repeated topical application of the same antiviral agent. The iontophoretically enhanced treated lesion received a single 10-15 minute treatment. All iontophoretically treated lesions demonstrated resolution in 24 hours and none of the unassisted topically treated lesions demonstrated a similar response. The results for the control group are summarized in Table 2.<br>
TABLE 2 CONTROL GROUP RESULTS <br>
(Table Removed)The clinical studies included patient volunteers with full informed consent who suffered from recurrent cold sores. The study demonstrated greatest treatment efficacy if the herpes lesion received iontophoretic treatment within 36 hours of lesion onset. The treatment incorporated an electrode saturated with Acyclovir® ointment (ZOVIRAX®) or IUDR (STOXIL®) Ophthalmic drops as supplied by the manufacturer. Thus mounted Anodic electrode of the prototype system was used for a 10-15 minute application directly to the lesion with the average current setting of .2 ma-.6 ma which was well tolerated by all patients.<br>
The lesion was evaluated in 24 hours. In 92% of the iontophoretically treated cases (&gt;70 lesions treated) a major response was noted. A major response was categorized by resolution of pain in 
While the invention has been described above with references to specific embodiments thereof, it is apparent that many changes, modifications and variations in the materials, arrangements of parts and steps can be made without departing from the inventive concept disclosed herein. For example, an impregnated conductive gel can also be used to as medicament containing medium to increase the physical stability and the tissue adhering characteristics of the electrode. Accordingly, the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims is intended to embrace all such changes, modifications and variations that may occur to one of skill in the art upon a reading of the disclosure. All patent applications, patents and other publication cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
