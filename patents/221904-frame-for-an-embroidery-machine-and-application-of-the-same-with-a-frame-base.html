				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present  invention  relates  to  frame  for  an  embroidery  machine   and application of the same with a frame base.<br>
The invention refers to a frame for an embroidery machine, particularly a shuttle embroidery machine,, comprising a front frame and a rear frame.<br>
The GB 25 531 discloses a frame with a front frame on which needles are located and a rear frame on which shuttles are located. Between the front frame and the rear frame is an interspace for the gate with the fabric to be embroidered. The front frame and the rear frame comprise a number of cast iron supports located spaced from each other. The supports are connected together by tubular connectors. A similar design is also disclosed in AT 360 320.<br>
EP 0.666 351 shows a picture of the Saurer embroidery machine 2040 on which the front frame comprises massive cast iron supports. This causes high material and transportation cost. Heavy cast iron supports cause also substantial accident risks when the machine is mounted.<br>
In an article published on December 9,1988 in 'Rhemtaler" the embroidery machine Lasser L83 is disclosed. This machine has a modular machine frame of similar design as disclosed later in EP 0 599 053. Frames of this design may be manufactured from welded parts instead of cast iron parts. This provides a weight reduction. However, of disadvantage is the necessity of a plurality of supports and braces which are relatively expensive in manufacturing and must be screwed together. This is illustrated by the Prior Art frame design described as follows.<br>
In the figures 1 to 5 a frame design consisting of three sections A, B and C of a commercially available embroidery machine is disclosed. Figures 2 and 3 disclose the rear frame, and figures 4 to 5 disclose the front frame of the section A and B of the embroidery machine in a explosive representation. In figure 1 all three frame sections<br><br>
designated A, B and C are visible. Between the front frame 12 and the back frame 10 isa interspace for the gate (not shown) which can be moved up and down on the<br>
columns 15 provided with rails 16. The first section of the rear frame 10 (fig. 2)<br>
comprises the supports 21 and 23 which are located on the bases 25,26, respectively,<br>
and the beam 27 and the strut 29. The second (fig. 3) and all further possible sections ofthe rear frame 10 comprise a further support 23 and a further base 26, a beam 31 and astrut The first section A of the front frame 12 (fig. 4) comprises the supports 35 which arelocated on the bases 39 and the beam 41 and the strut 43. The second  and allfurther possible sections B, C,....of the front frame 12 consist of a further support <br>
with base 39, a beam 45, a strut 46, a mounting plate 47 for cone spool holders and two<br>
mounting plates 49 for spool holders.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide for an embroidery machine a frame<br>
which is simple in design, consists of fewer parts, has a lower weight but is<br>
nevertheless equally or still more stable than Prior Art frames.<br>
According to the invention this is obtained in that the front frame and/ or the rear<br>
frame substantially comprises a profile which extends in longitudinal direction of the<br>
machine and has a height corresponding t the height of the frame. This provides a<br>
substantially simpler construction than previously known. The manufacturing of the<br>
frame is substantially simplified, and also a substantial reduction of weight is obtained.<br>
Further, certain surfaces of the profile provide a possibility to fasten e.g. spool holders<br>
or cone spool holders without special mounting plates required up to now. Other<br>
surfaces serve as mounting surfaces for construction units or pedestals.<br>
For small embroidery machines the front frame and the rear frame can be provided by<br>
a single length of profile. For larger embroidery machines the front frame and/or the<br>
rear frame consists preferably for of several lengths of profile or sections connected<br>
together. These sections have a relatively low weight and therefore can be mounted at<br>
the place of installation with relatively little effort.<br>
The profile is preferably a practically rectangular hollow profile. This profile may<br>
contain an opening extending over a part or the whole length of the profile so that in<br>
the interior of the profile stiffening ribs spaced from each other may be built in and<br>
fastened e.g. by welding. The stiffening ribs may be plate-shaped. Underneath of the<br>
columns for the gate preferably stiffening ribs are provided which consist of a hollow<br>
body, e.g. a folded metal sheet, to carry the load of columns and the gate.<br>
The profiles for the front frame and the rear frame are preferably manufactured by<br>
bending a metal plate. The profile may also be an extrusion profile. The tool costs for<br>
extrusion profiles of such dimensions are relatively high. However, from a certain<br>
quantity of pieces the extrusion method may be cheaper than the bending of sheet<br>
metal. The same applies for the manufacturing of profiles by rolling.<br>
The invention concerns also the application of the frame together with a frame<br>
foundation having a mounting surface located approximately in the middle of the<br>
distance between the floor and the upper wall of the rear frame and the front frame,<br>
respectively. The mounting surface is preferably located approximately 50 cm above<br>
the floor of the factory.<br>
Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the drawing.<br>

Figure 11 shows a Prior Art frame and the foundation seen from the side and in<br>
crossed section, respectively.<br>
Figure 12 shows the frame according to figure 6 from the side and the corresponding<br>
foundation in crossed section.<br>
The Prior Art frame shown in figures 1 to 5 has already been described before.<br>
The frame according to an embodiment of the invention, as shown in the figures 6 and<br>
12, also comprises three frame sections designated A, 8 and C. This frame can be<br>
enlarged by further sections according to the construction of section B to build a largermachine. It would also be possible to form the section A and B as a single section. Infigures 6 and 12 again columns 15 for the gate can be seen, Not shown, however are therails 16 of figure 1. Both the columns 15 and the rails 16 are not subject of the presentinvention. Of importance is a construction of the rear frame 11 and the front frame 13.This construction is in particular visible from the figures 7a to l0a. A comparison withthe figures 2 to 5 clearly shows the differences with respect to the Prior Art.As figure 6 shows, the rear frame 11 consists, for example, of three sections A, B, Cconnected together/ for example, by screws. To understand the construction of the rearframe 11 it is sufficient to have a look at the view from the back of the section A asshown in figure 7b together at the view from the front according to figure 7a. Thissection A comprises essentially a profile 51 extending in longitudinal direction andhaving a height corresponding to the desired height of the frame. In the interior of theprofile 51 stiffening ribs 53,55 (fig. 7b) are located spaced from each other. Thestiffening ribs 53 are plate-shaped. The stiffening rib 55 is of a stronger construction inorder to carry the load of the column 15 (fig. 6) and the gate. The stiffening rib 55 maybe manufactured by folding a metal sheet plate.<br>
The profile 51 can be designated as a hollow profile being practically rectangular. It<br>
preferably consists of a folded metal plate. It has a practically vertical wall 57. From<br>
this wall 57 extend horizontally a lower wall 61 and an upper wall 63. From the upper<br>
wall 63 extends a wall 65 a short distance downward, and from the lower wall 61<br>
extends a wall 67 a short distance upward. This limits an opening 68 providing access<br>
into the interior of the profile and permits a welding or another kind of connecting the<br>
stiffening ribs 53,55 to the profile 51, On the embodiment shown the opening 68<br>
extends over the whole length of the profile 51. At the bottom of the profile 51<br>
mounting lugs 69 are welded.In particular from the figures 7a and 7b it is visible that the wall 57 is bent in such away that a channel 59 is formed in this wall. The channel 59 extends in the longitudinaldirection of the profile 51. In this way three different mounting surfaces 58,60,62 areprovided on the wall 57.The plate, from which the profile 51 is manufactured, is preferably an iron sheet, A<br>
thickness of 6 mm of the sheet metal has been found advantageous.<br>
As figures 8a and 8b show, the sections B, C are of substantially the same construction<br>
as section A but longer. It may be referred to the previous description.<br>
As figure 6 shows, the front frame 13 comprises, for example, three sections A, B, C<br>
which may be connected together, for example, by screws. To understand the<br>
construction of the front frame 13 it may be sufficient to have a look at the view from,<br>
the front of the section A together with the view from the back according to figure 9b.<br>
If the front frame 13 is compared with the just described back frame 11 it is also seen<br>
that its construction is substantially the same so that a detailed description is not<br>
required. The profile 51' of the front frame comprises walls 57', 61', 63', 65', 67'. The<br>
profile also extends in longitudinal direction of the embroidery machine and has a<br>
height according to the desired height of the frame. However, the Opening 68' is on the<br>
front side, and there is no channel 59. A stiffening rib of the kind of the stiffening rib 55<br>
in figure 7b is missing. Because the front frame 13 does not have to carry columns 15<br>
plate-shaped stiffening ribs 53' suffice.<br>
A particular advantage of the form of the front frame as a profile extending in<br>
longitudinal direction of the embroidery machine consists in that the wall 65 of the<br>
profile, as seen in figure 10a, may serve as mounting plate for spool holders (not<br>
shown). A plurality of mounting holes 71 can be seen. Further a wall 57 of the profile<br>
may serve as mounting plate for cone spool holders. Visible are the mounting holes <br>
for the cone spool holders.<br>
In figure 11 a Prior Art frame according to figure 1 is shown after its mounting on the<br>
foundation 81. Clearly visible is the interspace 14 for the gate (not shown) which can<br>
also move down into the trench 83.<br>
In the side view of figure 12 the frame according to figure 6 of the embodiment of the<br>
invention is shown after its mounting oh the foundation 82. In this embodiment of the<br>
invention both the rear frame 11 and the front frame 13 ate not as high as on the<br>
machine according to the Prior Art The mounting surface 85 of the foundation 82 is<br>
located approximately in the middle of the distance between the floor 84 and the upperwalls 67,67" of the rear frame 11 and the front frame 13, respectively. The mountingsurface 85 of the foundation may, for example, be approximately 50 cm above the floor84. This increases the cost for the foundation, but this disadvantage is more than offsetby the lower cost for the machine frame and the transport of the lighter machine.Of advantage is also the smaller height of the machine, because this reduces also thelength of the lever arm which is formed, for example, by the back frame and thecolumns 15. This again permits a lighter construction and a corresponding saving ofweight.<br>
Many modifications of the frame constructions are possible without deviating from theinventive thought For example, it would be possible to construct a profile from severalpartial profiles.Summerising the following may be stated:<br>
The frame for an embroidery machine comprises a front frame 13 and a rear frame 11.<br>
They consist substantially of a profile 51,51' extending in longitudinal direction of the<br>
embroidery machine and having a height corresponding to the height of the frame.<br>
Each profile has a practically vertical wall 57,57 from which a lower wall 61,61' and<br>
an upper wall 63,63' extend horizontally in the same direction so that a lateral opening<br>
68 is formed. In the interior of the profile e.g. plate shaped stiffening rips located<br>
spaced from each other are provided. For further stiffening a wall 65,65' extends<br>
downward from the upper wall and a wall 67, 67extends upward from the lower wall<br>
61,61'. A wall 65' of the profile 51" serves to mount the spool holders, and a wall 57 ofthe profile 51' serves to mount the cone spool holders. The profile 51,51' consists of abent sheet metal plate. The described frame is simpler in construction and cheaper in<br>
manufacturing and has a substantially lower weight than Prior Art frames. A further<br>
weight reduction is possible, if the foundation is formed in such a way that its<br>
mounting surface 85 will be at a higher level.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
