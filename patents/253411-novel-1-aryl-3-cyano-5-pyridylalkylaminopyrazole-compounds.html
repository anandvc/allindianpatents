				<td>The present invention relates to novel 1- aryl-3-cyano-5-pyridylalkylaminopyrazole compounds.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel l-aryl-3-cya-no-5-pyridYlalkylaminopyrazole derivatives and. a pest control agent, particularly an insecticide, comprising the same as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the agricultural and horticultural field, a wide variety of insecticides as a pest control agent have been hitherto developed and put into practical use for the purpose of controlling various pest insects.<br>
For example, as pyrazole compounds having insecticidal activity, 3-cyano-l-phenylpyrazole derivatives having an amino group which may be substituted at the 5-position are disclosed in JP-A-62-228065, JP-A-63-316771, and JP-A-3-118369, substituted l-aryl-3-cyano-5-(het)arylmethylideneiminopyrazole derivatives are disclosed in - JP-A-5-148240, and substituted l-aryl-5-(het) arylmethylaminopyrazole derivatives are disclosed in JP-A-64-47768.<br>
However, the compounds disclosed' in the above literatures are not necessarily satisfactory in all of insecticidal effects, insecticidal spectrum, safety, and the like, and thus the development of novel compounds overcoming these problems has been desired. As a result, novel l-aryl-3-cyano-5-heteroarylalkylaminopyrazole derivatives are disclosed as compounds exhibiting a high safety in JP-A-10-338676.<br>
However, the compounds disclosed in JP-A-10-338676 and the like are more excellent in insecticidal activity and have a more reduced toxicity than known compounds but problems that the compounds have insufficient performance in view of systemic activity and that those having a high systemic activity have a relatively insufficient safety have been found.  In view of efficient application of an agent for pest control and application for soil treatment especially effective for controlling pest organisms such as fluid-sucking pests,  systemic activity is an important factor. Moreover, in recent years, the safety to organisms other than target pest insects and the environment has been increasingly  demanded  and,   hereafter,  measures  for environmental protection will be strongly taken.  Therefore, in order to develop pesticides satisfying more strict regulation,  it has been an important problem to find compounds having a higher safety.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
As a result of the intensive studies for solving the above problems, the present inventors have found that a compound having an improved systemic activity and a high safety is obtained by using a pyridyl group as the heteroaryl group attached to the alkylamino group at the 5-position of the pyrazole ring in l-aryl-3-cyano-5-heteroarylalkylaminopyrazole derivatives and further using a partially halogenated specific alkylthio group as the substituent at the 4-position of the pyrazole ring, and have accomplished the present invention.<br>

After the inoculation, the bottle was put in a glass cylinder (diameter: 3.5 cm; height: 15 cm, with a mesh cover) , and the insects were let to proliferate in a constant temperature room kept at 25°C for 3 days. The imagoes on the leaves were removed, and the leaves were soaked in an aqueous dilution of an agricultural and horticultural insecticide of the present invention prepared in accordance with Formulation Example 3 (for about 5<br><br>
seconds) and then returned into the glass cylinder (duplicates at a concentration) . The cylinder was kept in the constant temperature room at 25°C, and the number of the insects on the leaves was counted on the 4th day after the treatment to obtain a death rate (%) based on the results. The results obtained are shown in Table 5 (the compound numbers in the table correspond to the numbers in Table 1).<br>

Test Example 5<br>
Insecticidal effect on Larvae of brown rice planthopper<br>
(Nilaparvata lugens) through systemic activity:<br>
Roots of young rice seedlings (height: about 10 cm) planted in a plastic cup were washed with water and soil was washed away so as not to damage the fine roots. The stem was pinched by a urethane tip (diameter: 3 cm, height: 2 cm) having a cut line and the roots were inserted into an Erlenmeyer flask to which 50 ml of an agent solution (an aqueous dilution of the agricultural and<br><br>
horticultural insecticide of the present invention prepared in  accordance with  Formulation Example  1)  was  placed beforehand  (2  to 3 young rice seedlings/flask) .   The urethane chip was wedged into the mouse of the flask to fix the rice seedlings.  A glass tube (diameter: 3 cm, height: 5 cm) was placed thereon, wedged into the urethane chip, and fixed with a tape.  The flask in such state was kept in a constant temperature room at 25°C for 3 days.   Five larvae- of Nilaparvata lugens were placed in the glass tube and then the tube was capped with a urethane chip, followed by keeping  in  the  constant  temperature  room  at 25°C (duplicates at a concentration) .  The mortality and agony of the larvae were investigated on 4th day after the treatment to obtain a death rate (%) taking an agonizing insect as a. 1/2 dead insect.  This test was carried out on two agent solutions different in the concentration of the active ingredient.  The results are shown in Table 6 (the compound numbers in the table correspond to the numbers in Table 1).<br>
Additionally, as reference compounds, Compounds I, II and III described in JP-A-10-338676 were similarly tested.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Table 6<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Brown rice planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) is a highly problematic pest insect species in agricultural and horticultural cases, but a sufficient effect cannot be attained by the application method of spraying an agent to stems and leafs, provided that the detection is delayed or that an enough amount of the agent is not spread to the roots.<br>
Since this species has a characteristic of making its habitat around the roots of rice plant or the like and harming the plant through sucking fluid, more efficient<br>
method of controlling the insect may be a method of treating the surface of soil with an agent (granule treatment) before the outbreak of the species occurs widely. However, in order to attain a high controlling effect by such a method, a penetrating and migrating property (systemic property) into a plant body is required as the nature of the agent. As is apparent from Table 6, all of the compounds of the present invention and Compound I exhibited an insecticidal activity through a high systemic property against this species of a highly problematic pest insect. On the other hand, Compounds II and III exhibited an obviously inferior effect owing to its lower property than the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Test Example 6<br>
In vitro intercellular metabolic cooperation inhibition<br>
test (IMC):<br>
In this Test Example, using an inhibitory action of gap-junctional intercellular communication as an index, the existence of carcinogenicity (tumor-promoting action) of a compound was investigated.<br>
In this test, a mixed culture system of Chinese hamster  lung  fibroblast  line  V79   (hgprt+)   having , hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity and cells having no such activity (hgprt-)  was treated by adding thereto the following compounds together with 6-<br>
thioguanine (6-TG). When the intercellular communication is normal, the toxic metabolite of 6-TG formed in hgprt+ cells (6-TG sensitive) is transferred into hgprt- cells (6-TG resistant) through gap junction, so that both of the cells die. On the other hand, when the intracellular communication is inhibited by the test compound, only the hgprt- cells survive and form colonies.<br>
As a result of the test on Compound No. 2 of the present invention and Comparative Compound I which exhibits a high systemic activity in the above Test Example 5, Compound No. 2 of the present invention was found to be negative but a significant increase of colony forming rate was observed at 7.5 and 15 µg/ml in the case of Compound I and thus Compound I was found to be positive.<br>
Accordingly, from the test result, the compound of the present invention was found to have a lower carcinogenic risk than Compound I.<br>
Test Example 7<br>
Insecticidal effect on cat flea:<br>
Onto a round filter (diameter: 10 cm) was added dropwise 0.7 ml of an agent solution diluted to a predetermined concentration. After drying, the filter was placed on the bottom of a cylinder (diameter: 10 cm x height: 30 cm) . Ten fleas were set free therein and the mortality was investigated on 1st day and 2nd day after the<br>
treatment to calculate a death rate (%) based on the results. The results are shown in Table 7 (the compound numbers in the table correspond to the numbers in Table 1).<br>

The present invention is precisely explained with reference to specific embodiments but it is obvious for those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be carried out without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
