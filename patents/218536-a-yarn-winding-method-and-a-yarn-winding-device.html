A Yarn Minding Method and a Yarn Winding Device<br>
(Technical Field)<br>
[000l]<br>
The present invention relates to a yarn winding method<br>
and a yarn vending device, and more specifically, it relates to a<br>
yarn winding method and a yarn winding device wherein bobbins are<br>
fitted on bobbin holders., packages are wound on the bobbins<br>
installed on the bobbin holders while traversing the yarns by<br>
traverse means, and when the bobbin holders reach a specified<br>
wind ratio, a traverse speed, in winding is increased so that, the<br>
wind raLia can Avoid s ribbon wind area.<br>
(Background Art)<br>
[0002]<br>
Generally, in a procedure wherein a yarn is wound at a<br>
high speed onto a bobbin holder so as to form a package, when the<br>
"wind ratio", which is defined as ratio between the rotational<br>
speed of the bobbin holder and the number, of traverse, becomes an<br>
integral number or an integral number + 1/2, so called ribbon<br>
wind is generated because yarns, which ate returned at both the<br>
ends of the package and which are traversed onto the package,<br>
i.e., the yarn which was wound at previous traverse time and the<br>
yarn which will be wound at next traverse time, directly locate<br>
one above the other,<br>
[0003]<br>
When ribbon wind causes, such problems may occur that<br>
wound yarn density and mass distribution in the package become<br>
non-uniform, that vibration may cause during winding of package,<br>
that yarn breakage or collapae of package occurs, and in the<br>
later process, there may occur such a problem that withdrawal Of<br>
yarn from package cannot done smoothly.<br>
(0004)<br>
In order to obviate the aboveâ€”described problems, method<br>
for avoiding the ribbon wind generating area, i.e.,  ribbon wind<br>
area, is generally carried out wherein the traverse speed Vt is<br>
rapidly increased near the wind ratio so that the wind ratio does<br>
not become an integral number.<br>
- 1 -<br><br>
[0005]<br>
In recent years, in order to Increase production, there<br>
is a tendency to apply multi-ends by combining a plurality of<br>
winding machines.<br>
[0006]<br>
for example, Patent Reference 1, i.e., Japanese Patent<br>
Application Laid-open Mo. 2002-515388. discloses that two turret<br>
tables are arranged vertically on one machine frame, and unite<br>
constructed by them are arranged symmetrically in a horizontal<br>
direction.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, the present applicant proposed in Patent<br>
Reference 2, i.e., Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-033760,<br>
in order to increase space efficiency and to reduce the equipment<br>
cost, a revolving type automatic yarn winding machine comprising<br>
a turret table rotatable about a rotating center and having at<br>
least two bobbin holders ratatably mounted thereon, a press<br>
roller and a traverse device disposed upstream along a yarn<br>
passage relative to the bobbin holder, wheraby a bobbin installed<br>
on one bobbin holder is switched to a bobbin installed on the<br>
other bobbin holder when the yarn wound, on the bobbin reaches a<br>
predetermined amount characterized in that said turret, tables are<br>
disposed on both sides of the yarn passage, respectively, the<br>
rotating directions of one turret table and the other turret<br>
table are opposed to each other, and the rotating directions of<br>
the press roller installed correspondingly to the one turret,<br>
table and the press roller installed correspondingly to the other<br>
turret table are opposed to each other, and the press rollers and<br>
a traverse device ars positioned above the rotating centers of<br>
the turret tables,<br>
[0008]<br>
in the winding machine disclosed in Patent Reference 2,<br>
traverse devices may be disposed for the bobbin holders mounted<br>
on the two turret tables, respectively, so that packages are<br>
wound on the bobbin holders mounted on the two turret tables, and<br>
alternatively, a common single traverse device may be disposed<br>
far the bobbin holders mounted on the two turret tables so that<br>
yarns are traversed by the single traverse device and SO that<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
packages are wound on the bobbin holders mounted on the two<br>
turret tables.<br>
[Patant Reference l]    Japanese Patent Application Laid-<br>
open No. 2002-515388<br>
[Patent Reference 2]    Japanese patent Application N0.<br>
2002-033760<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to Be Solved by the invention]<br>
[0009]<br>
The above-described Patent Reference 2 does not includes<br>
detailed description regarding the traverse control.  However, In<br>
actual, the diameter of the package being wound on either one of<br>
two bobbin holders is detected as basis so as to avoid ribbon<br>
wind area.<br>
[0010]<br>
However, especially when a common single traverse device<br>
is disposed for the bobbin holders mounted on the two turret<br>
tables and when yarns are traversed by the single traverse device<br>
so as to form packages on the two bobbin holders, there may occur<br>
difference in wound diameters in the horizontally separated<br>
packages which are being wound due to the difference in the<br>
thickness of the yarns which are being wound while sandwiching<br>
the traverse device therebetween, due to the difference in the<br>
pressing pressures of the press rollers, or due to the difference<br>
in the parallelism (errors in adjustment) between the bobbin<br>
holders and the press rollers,  in such occasion, since there is<br>
one single traverse device, if avoiding of ribbon wind is done<br>
based on either one wound diameter, there is a probability that<br>
ribbon wind occurs in either one of packages, especially that<br>
wound on the bobbin holder which is not used as basis of wound<br>
diameter, during winding operation.<br>
[0011]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to obviate such<br>
problems. Further, it is another object of the present invention<br>
to provide a yarn winding method and device by which ribbon wind<br>
can be avoided for all the bobbin holders even when there occurs<br>
difference in wound diameters in packages, which are being wound<br>
on a plurality of bobbin holders while a single traverse device<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
is used,<br>
[0012]<br>
Further, it is another object of the present invention to<br>
provide a yarn winding method and device, which can be carried<br>
out in such a yarn winding device as disclosed in the above-<br>
described Patent Reference 1 or 2, by which ribbon wind can be<br>
avoided, which winds packages with almost uniform yarn wound<br>
density and almost uniform mass distribution, by which vibration,<br>
yarn breakage, or collapse of package dose not occur during<br>
package winding operation, and which can wind yarn packages with.<br>
good withdrawal efficiency at a later process,<br>
[Means to solve the Problems]<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the present invention, the above-described<br>
objects are achieved by a yarn winding method wherein bobbins are<br>
fitted on bobbin holders, packages are wound on the bobbins<br>
installs-d on the bobbin holders while traversing the yarns by<br>
traverse means, and when the bobbin holders reach a specified<br>
wind ratio, a traverse speed in winding is increased so that the<br>
wind ratio can avoid a ribbon wind area, characterised in that<br>
a single common traverse means is installed for the<br>
plurality of bobbin holders so that packages are simultaneously<br>
wound on the plurality of bobbin holders, and<br>
when any of the plurality of bobbin holders reaches a<br>
wind ratio that must be avoided, the traverse means is controlled<br>
so that all the bobbin holders can avoid the ribbon wind area.<br>
[0014]<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the above-<br>
described objects are achieved by a yarn winding device wherein<br>
bobbins are fitted on bobbin holders, packages are wound on the<br>
bobbins installed on the bobbin holdets while traversing the<br>
yarns by traverse means, and when the bobbin holders reach a<br>
specified wind ratio, a traverse speed in winding is increased so<br>
that the wind ratio can avoid a ribbon wind area, characterized<br>
in that<br>
a plurality of bobbin holders on which winding of<br>
packages are simultaneously performed are disposed, and a single<br>
Common traverse means is installed for the plurality of bobbin<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
holders, and<br>
said, traverse means comprises a traverse device and a<br>
traverse control device for controlling said, traverse device,<br>
whereby said traverse control device controls said traverse<br>
device, so that all the bobbin holders can avoid the ribbon wind<br>
area when any of the plurality of bobbin holders resches a wind<br>
ratio that must be avoided.<br>
[0015]<br>
In these occasions, it is preferred that the wind ratio<br>
before avoiding the ribbon wind area is calculated based on the<br>
bobbin holder with the largest winding diameter in winding, and<br>
that the wind ratio after avoiding the ribbon wind area is so set<br>
that the bobbin holder with the minimum winding diameter in<br>
winding avoids the ribbon wind area.<br>
[0016]<br>
Further, it is preferred that the wind ratio before<br>
avoiding the ribbon wind area and the wind ratio aftes avoiding<br>
the ribbon wind area are compared with each other, and that when<br>
the difference in winding angles of the wound packages exceeds a<br>
predetermined amount, warning signals are sent.<br>
[0017]<br>
According to the present invention, the traverse means<br>
may ccmprise a single traverse device disposed eommonly for a<br>
plurality of bobbin holders and a traverse control device for<br>
controlling the single traverse device.  Alternatively, according<br>
to the present invention, said traverse means may comprise a<br>
plurality of traverse devices disposed for said plurality of<br>
bobbin holders, respectively, and a traverse control device fp.t<br>
controlling said plurality of traverse devices.<br>
[0018]<br>
According to the present invention, even such a<br>
construction as disclosed in Patent Reference 1, i,e., Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-open No, 2002-515383, is used, ribbon<br>
wind of packages being wound on all the bobbin holders by means<br>
of a single traverse device, i.e., a traverse motor, can be<br>
avoided.<br>
[0019]<br>
According to the present invention, even in a revolving<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
type automatic winding device having a construction as disclosed<br>
in Patent Reference 2, i.e., Japanese Patent Application No. 2002-<br>
033760, packages which are free from ribbon wind can be forced.<br>
[Advantages of the Invention]<br>
[0020]<br>
According to the present, invention, a yarn winding method<br>
and device ana provided, by which ribbon wind, for all the bobbin<br>
holders can be avoided even if difference in wound diameters<br>
occurs in any one of the package while yarns are wound on a<br>
plurality of bobbin holders by means of one single traverse<br>
device.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, a yarn<br>
winding method and device are provided, by which ribbon wind can<br>
be avoided, which winds packages with almost uniform yarn wound<br>
density and almost uniform mass distribution, by which vibration,<br>
yarn breakage, or collapse of package does not occur during<br>
package winding operation, and by which yarn packages with good<br>
withdrawal efficiency at a later process can be wound.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br>
[0021]<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein some<br>
embodiments of the present invention are illustrated, wherein<br>
Fig.l shows a schematic view showing construction of an<br>
embodiment of the winding device according to the present<br>
invention, and Fig. 2 is a view seen in a direction of arrow X, a<br>
part of which is omitted.<br>
[0023]<br>
In Figs. 1 and 2, two circular disk shaped turret tables<br>
4 and 4' are ratatably mounted on the front surface of a machine<br>
frame 5 in such condition that their parallel central axes are<br>
horizontally spaced with each other, and each of turret tables 4<br>
and 4' is rotatable about the respective axis by means of a<br>
rotating motor (not shown).<br>
[0023]<br>
The ends negr the machine frame of bobbin holders 1, 1' ,<br>
2 and 2' are rotatably mounted on the turret tables 4 and 4' , and<br>
bobbin holders 1, l' , 2 and 2' extend from the turret tables 4<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
and 4' in a direction perpendicular to the sheet on which Fig. 1<br>
is drawn.<br>
[0024]<br>
The bobbin holders 1, 1' , 2 and 2' have a plurality of<br>
bobbins 3 and 3' mounted thereon, respectively, and the bobbins 3<br>
and 3' rotate together with the bobbin holders 1, 1' , 2 and 2' so<br>
as to wind yarns Y and Y' on the peripheries of the bobbins 3 and<br>
3' and to form a plurality of packages P and P' .<br>
[0025]<br>
More specifically, in Fig. 2, the bobbin holders 1, l' ,<br>
are connected to bobbin holder driving motors 12 and 12' via<br>
drive shafts 11 and 11 , and the motors 12 and 12' rotate at a<br>
rotating speed corresponding to the output from inverters 13 and<br>
13' which are controlled by a controller 23 so as to drive the<br>
bobbin holders so that in Fig. 1, the bobbin holder 3 mounted on<br>
the right turret table A is rotated in a clockwise direction<br>
while<br>
the bobbin holder 3' mounted on the left turret table 4' is<br>
rotated in a counter-clockwise direction.  Although the driving<br>
system of the bobbin holders 2 and 2' are similarly constructed,<br>
in order to simplify the explanation, the description of the<br>
bobbin holders 2 and 2' in this embodiment is omitted.<br>
The motors 12 and 12' have gears 14 and 14' ,<br>
respectively, for detecting rotation of the bobbin holders<br>
mounted at the ends thereof opposite to the bobbin holders 1 and<br>
X' , and electro-magnetic pickups 15 and 15' are disposed in such<br>
a manner that they face the gears 14 and 14' respectively.  Thus,<br>
the gears 14 and 14' and the electro-magnetic pickups 15 and 15'<br>
constitute means for detecting rotating numbers of the bobbin<br>
holders, and the rotating numbers Nb and Nb' of the bobbin<br>
holders 1 and 1' are detected by the electro-magnetic pickups 15<br>
and 15' and are input into a controller 23,<br>
[0026]<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 again, when the packages P and p' ,<br>
which have been wound on the bobbins 3 and 3' inserted onto the<br>
bobbin holder 1 end 1' , reach a predetermined amount, the turret<br>
table 4 and 4' are rotated in directions indicated by arrows in<br>
Fig, 1, more specifically, the right turret table 4 is rotated in<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
a clockwise direction and the left turret table 4' is rotated in<br>
a counter-clockwise direction, the bobbin holders 1 and 1' , on<br>
which yarns have been wound, are switched to the bobbin holders 2<br>
and 2' , onto which empty bobbins 2 and 3' are inserted, and yarns<br>
can be continuously wound on the bobbins 3 and 3' which are<br>
inserted onto the bobbin holders 2 and 2  without repeating the<br>
initial yarn threading operation which is effected at the start<br>
ot winding.<br>
The machine frame 5 has two slide rails 6 vertically<br>
disposed therein, and a vertically movable frame 7 is lifted and<br>
lowered along the slide rails 6 by means of a fluid pressure<br>
cylinder (not shown).<br>
[0028]<br>
The vertically movable frame 7 has two contact rollers 3<br>
and 8' rotatably mounted thereon, and the contact rollers 8 and 8'<br>
contact with and rotate the packages P and P' and apply a<br>
predetermined contacting pressure to the packages P and P' so as<br>
to form the shape and enhance the package hardness of the<br>
packages P and P .<br>
[0029]<br>
A traverse cam 9 is arranged between the two contact<br>
rollers 8 and 8' and is rotatably mounted on the vertically<br>
movable frame 7.  The traverse cam 9 has cam grooves formed on<br>
the periphery thereof, and two sliders 10 and 10  are engaged<br>
With the cam grooves, which sliders reciprocalingly move yarns in<br>
a direction of the bobbins due to the rotation of the traverse<br>
cam 9, and the sliders 10 and 10' face the contact rollers, 6 and<br>
8' , respectively.<br>
[0030]<br>
In Fig. 2, the traverse cam 9 is connected to a traverse<br>
motor 17 via a drive shaft 16, and the traverse motor 17 rotates<br>
the traverse cam 9 at a rotating speed which depends on the<br>
output of the inverter 18 which is controlled by the controller<br>
23.  Accordingly, the rotating speed of the traverse cam 9 is<br>
determined by the output of the inverter 18.  Farther, the<br>
traverse motor 17 has a gears 19 for detecting rotation of the<br>
traverse cam mounted at the ends thereof near the traverse cam<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
16, and an electro-magnetic pickup 20 is disposed in such a<br>
manner that it faces the gear 19,  Thus, the gear 19 and the<br>
electro-magnetic pickup 20 constitute means for detecting<br>
rotating numbers of the traverse cam, and the rotating numbers Nt<br>
of the traverse cam is detected, by the electro-magnetic pickup<br>
20.<br>
[0031]<br>
Further, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the contact rollers 8<br>
and 8' have gears 21 and 21' for detecting rotation of the<br>
contact rollers 8 and 8' mounted at the ends thereof opposite to<br>
the machine frame 5, and electro-magnetic pickups 22 and 22' are<br>
disposed in such a manner that they face the gears 21 and 21' .<br>
Thus, the gears 21 and 21' and the electro-magnetic pickups 22<br>
and 22' constitute means for detecting rotalling numbers of the<br>
contact rollers 8 and 8' .  The rotating numbers Nc and Nc' of the<br>
contact rollers 8 and 8' are detected by the electro-magnetic<br>
pickups 22 and 22' .<br>
[0032]<br>
As described above, the control of the outputs from each<br>
inverter 13, 13 or 18 is done based on the instruction from the<br>
controller 21, arvd the controller 23 is supplied with signals<br>
from the electro-magnetic pickups 15, 15' , 20, 21, 21' , i.e., the<br>
rotating numbers Nc and Nc' of the contact rollers 6 and 8' , the<br>
rotating numbers Nt of the traverse cam 9 and the rotating<br>
numbers Nb and Nb' of the bobbin holders 1 and 1' ,<br>
[0033]<br>
The winding speed of the yarns Y and Y can be detected<br>
by detecting and calculating the rotating numbers Nc and Nc' of<br>
the contact rollers 8 and 8' ,  Accordingly, due to the above-<br>
described construction, when the diameter of the contact rollers<br>
8 and 8' is Dc, the winding speed VC is calculated as follows,<br>
Ve=Ncs Î  X Dc	(1) ;<br>
the winding angle of the yarn wound onto the packages P and P' is<br>
calculated as follows using the winding speed Vc and the traverse<br>
speed Vtf which is obtained by detecting the rotating numbers Nt<br>
of the traverse cam 9,<br>
winding angle Î¸ = tan-1(Vt/Vc)  (2);<br>
and the diameter D of the wound package is obtained as follows<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
using the winding speed Vc, and the rotating numbers Nb and Nb<br>
of the bobbin holders,<br>
D = Vc/Ï€ /Mb (or Nb' )	(3),<br>
[0034]<br>
Now referring to Fig, 3, traverse control method for<br>
avoiding ribbon wind will now be explained.  Information which is<br>
needed Lo wind yarn, such as winding speed V, winding angle Î¸  ,<br>
traverse stroke S, wind ratio W for avoiding the ribbon wind, is<br>
input into the controller 23, Lhe relationship between the wound<br>
diameter D of package and the winding angle 0 is calculated, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3.<br>
[0035]<br>
More specifically, Pig. 3 will now explained, the lines<br>
indicated by Wl and W2, wherein suffix l shows the condition<br>
under the package diameter D1 and suffix 2 shows the condition<br>
under the package diameter D2, show lines on which the wind ratio<br>
w, which is defined as<br>
W=23/Ï€ /D/tan 0 ,<br>
becomes an integral number, the suffix being omitted here.  When<br>
Lhe winding condition of the winding device positions on the<br>
lines WI or VS2, ribbon wind is generated by yarns which form a<br>
plurality of turns on the packages, in other words, the yarns are<br>
returned at both the ends of the package and are traversed onto<br>
the package directly locate one above the other.<br>
[0036]<br>
Reference numeral "Î´ " indicates width for avoiding<br>
ribbon wind which is obtained in consideration of errors in<br>
package diameters in winding and so on and which is obtained by<br>
taking a predetermined range relative to the wind ratio.<br>
Accordingly, lowermost wind ratio for avoiding ribbon wind, i.e.,<br>
lowermost avoiding line L1' , for the wind ratio Wl which has to<br>
be avoided becomes,<br>
W1-Î´<br>
and, uppermost wind ratio for avoiding ribbon wind, i.e.,<br>
uppermost avoiding line L1, for the wind ratio Wl becomes,<br>
W1 + Î´ ,<br>
Similarly, the uppermost and lower most avoiding lines L2 and L2'<br>
can be obtained for the wind ratio W2 which has to be avoided.<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
[0037]<br>
AS a result, the areas of the wind ratio to. toe avoided<br>
during winding are Wa1 and Wa2 which are hatched in Fig. 3.<br>
These areas Wa1 and wa2 will be referred to as "ribbon wind<br>
avoiding areas" in the following explanation.<br>
[0038]<br>
When packages P and P' are wound while the number of<br>
traverse is set constant, the rotating numbers of bobbin holders<br>
decrease as the package diameter D increases, and the wind ratio,<br>
i.e., the rotating number of the bobbin holder/traverse number,<br>
varies along line "a" in Fig. 3.  When the wind ratio reaches the<br>
uppermost avoiding line L1, where the package diameter is D1 and<br>
the winding angle is Î¸ 0'  the rotating number of the traverse<br>
motor is increased at the the package diameter D1 in order to<br>
avoid winding within the ribbon wind avoiding area Wa1 so that<br>
wind ratio becomes on the lowermost avoiding line L1.  Thus, the<br>
ribbon wind is avoided, and the winding angle increases to 0 a.<br>
It is preferred that the rotating number of the traverse motor is<br>
quickly increased from the uppermost avoiding line L1 to the<br>
lowermost avoiding line L1' so as to minimize the winding time<br>
within the ribbon wind avoiding area Wa1 as short as possible.<br>
[0039]<br>
Thereafter, between the package diameter D1 and D2, the<br>
winding angle is gradually lowered from the winding angle Î¸ a<br>
toward the intersection between the winding angle Î¸ 0 and the<br>
uppermost avoiding line L2 for package diameter D2 along the line<br>
"b""<br>
[0040]<br>
Further, when the wind ratio reach the uppermost avoiding<br>
line L2, wherein the package diameter is D2, as the diameters of<br>
the package P and P' increase, the rotating number of the<br>
traverse motor is quickly increased similarly to the above-<br>
described explanation, and the wind ratio is varied to the<br>
lowermost avoiding line L2' , wherein the winding angle is Î¸ b.<br>
The above-described traverse control is repeated during winding,<br>
winding within the ribbon wind avoiding areas Wa can be avoided<br>
until fully wound package is completed, and package free from<br>
ribbon wind can be obtained,<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
[0041]<br>
An actual embodiment of the present invention wherein<br>
winding of packages which are wound onto a plurality of bobbin<br>
holders is simultaneously controlled without generating ribbon<br>
wind will now be explained with reference to Figs. 1 and 4.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the case where the traverse control method for<br>
avoiding ribbon wind which has been explained with reference to<br>
Fig. 3 is carried out, when only the diameter of the package P<br>
which Is wound on either one, for example, bobbin holder 1, of<br>
bobbin holders 1 and 2 or 1' and 2' is detected as basis, and<br>
when the ribbon wind is avoided, there may occur difference in<br>
wound diameters in the horizontally separated packages, which are<br>
being wound, due to the difference in the thickness of the yarns<br>
Y	and Y' which are being wound while sandwiching the traverse<br>
device, i.e., traverse cam 9, therebetween, due to the difference<br>
in the pressing pressures of the press rollers 8 and 8' , or due<br>
to the difference in the parallelism {errors In adjustment)<br>
between the bobbin holders l and 2 and the press rollers a and 8' .<br>
In such occasion, if avoiding of ribbon wind is done based on<br>
either one wound diameter wound on either one, for example bobbin<br>
holder 1, of bobbin holders, there is a probability that ribbon<br>
wind occurs in the package that is wound on the bobbin holder,<br>
the bobbin holder 2 in this embodiment, which is not used as<br>
basis of wound diameter, during winding operation,<br>
[0043]<br>
According to the present invention, a plurality of bobbin<br>
holders 1 and 2 are detected as basis, and when either one of<br>
them reaches the wind ratio to be avoided, the control of the<br>
traverse means, i.e., traverse cam 9, is performed so that all<br>
the bobbin holders 1 and 2 avoid the ribbon wind area.<br>
[0044]<br>
The step will now be explained.  At the initial threading<br>
operation, beneath the spinnerets of the spinning machine, yarns<br>
Y	are threaded onto feed rollers and yarn guides while they ire<br>
sucked into a suction device.  Then, the yarns Y and Y' are<br>
threaded onto the bobbins 3 and 3' inserted onto the bobbin<br>
holders 1 and 1  by means of yarn threading device (not shown].<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
The threading onto bobbins 3 and 3' may be done completely at the<br>
Same time, or may be done substantially at the same time, in<br>
Other words, done with time difference which does not cause any<br>
trouble.<br>
[Q0451<br>
After completion of yarn threading, under the winding<br>
speed Vc, the relationship between the wound diameter D and the<br>
winding angle &amp; is selected and winding operation is started,<br>
and winding within the ribbon wind avoiding areas Wa illustrated,<br>
in Fig. 4 is avoided.<br>
[0046]<br>
The winding speed Vc is obtained by detecting the<br>
rotating numbers Nc and Me' of the contact rollers 8 and 8; which<br>
are in contact with the packages P and P  at a. predetermined<br>
pressure and using the above-described equation (1).<br>
[0047]<br>
The diameter D of the wound package is calculated at the<br>
controller 23 using the above-deseribed equation. (3} by the<br>
rotating, numbers Nb and Nb' of this bobbin holders 1 and. 1" and<br>
the winding speed Vc calculated as described above.<br>
[O043J<br>
Further, the winding speed Vc is maintained at a constant<br>
Speed by outputting frequencies corresponding to the winding<br>
speed Vc and wound diameter D of the package into the inverter 13<br>
and 13 .<br>
10049]<br>
The winding angle 0 obtained by the above-described<br>
eguation {2) is controlled by controlling the reciprocating speed<br>
Of the sliders [0 and JO' , i.e., the rotating number of the<br>
traverse motor 17 which applies rotating force to the traverse<br>
cajn 9, relative to the winding speed Vc.<br>
[0050]<br>
Further, at the controller 23, the diameters D and D' of<br>
the packages which are obtained from the rotating numbers Kb and<br>
Nb' of the bobbin holders 1 and 1 are compared with each other<br>
from the start of winding operation, and the wind ratio<br>
corresponding to the diameters D and D' of the packages are also<br>
calculated.<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
[0051]<br>
Assuming that the diameter of the packages which are<br>
being wound are DO and DO' and that the difference in the wound<br>
diameters (DO - DO' ) is created.  Under this condition, the<br>
winding is continued at a predetermined winding angle.<br>
Step (1)<br>
When the wind ratio for the larger package diameter<br>
becomes L1, in other words, when the wound diameter (in this<br>
embodiment D1) satisfies<br>
(W1+Î´) = 2S/Ï€ /D1/tan Î¸ 0.<br>
the traverse speed Vt is quickly increased to Î¸ 1, which is<br>
obtained from<br>
(W2-Î´)=2S/Ï€/D1' /tan Î¸ 1,<br>
so that the wind ratio of the smaller package diameter fin this<br>
embodiment Dl' } becomes L1' and so that avoiding of ribbon wind,<br>
i.e., ribbon jump, is done.<br>
[0052]<br>
When ribbon jump is done by quickly increasing the<br>
traverse speed Vt to the angle 0 1 which is obtained from the<br>
smaller package diameter as described above, the winding angle Î¸<br>
1 after ribbon jump varies from the winding angle Î¸ a which was<br>
previously determined in the controller 23 upon start of winding<br>
operation.  In order to overcome this problem, in the controller<br>
23, a line L1-2, which gradually lowers from the winding angle Î¸<br>
1 after ribbon jump toward the intersection between the winding<br>
angle  Î¸ 0 and the uppermost avoiding line L2 as a target, is<br>
formed, and the winding angle is controlled along the line L1-2<br>
until the package with larger wound diameter reaches the<br>
uppermost avoiding line L2.<br>
[0053]<br>
Step [2]<br>
Thereafter, the winding angle Î¸ is controlled along the<br>
line L1-2, and when the wind ratio of the larger package diameter<br>
D becomes equal to L2 again, in other words, the wound diameter<br>
(in this embodiment D2) becomes equal to that obtained from<br>
(W2 + Î´ )=2S/Î  /D2/tan Î¸ 0,<br>
ribbon jump is done by quickly increasing the traverse speed Vt-<br>
until Î¸ 2 which is obtained from<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
(W2-Î´ )-2S/Î /D2/tan Î¸ 2<br>
is achieved so that the wind ratio of the smaller package<br>
diameter (in this embodiment D2' ) becomes equal to L2' .<br>
[0054]<br>
Step (3)<br>
Similar to the above-described step (1), when ribbon Jump<br>
is done by quickly increasing the traverse speed Vt until 0 2<br>
which is obtained from the smaller package diameter, the winding<br>
angle after ribbon jump varies from the winding angle Î¸ b which<br>
was previously determined in the controller 23 upon start of<br>
Winding operation.  In order to overcome this problem, in the<br>
controller 23, a line L2-3 which gradually lowers from the<br>
winding angle Î¸ 2 after ribbon jump toward the intersection<br>
between the winding angle Î¸ 0 and the uppermost avoiding line L3<br>
inot shown) as a target, is formed, and the winding angle is<br>
controlled along the line L2-3 until the package with larger<br>
wound diameter reaches the uppermost avoiding line L3.<br>
[0055]<br>
If the above-described steps (l) to (3) are repeated,<br>
generation of ribbon wind during winding operation can be<br>
avoided.  Further, since the wind ratio before avoiding the<br>
ribbon wind area is calculated based on the bobbin holder with<br>
the largest winding diameter in winding, and since the traverse<br>
speed Vt is increased until the wind ratio of the bobbin holder<br>
with the minimum winding diameter in winding after avoiding the<br>
tibbon wind area can avoid the ribbon wind area, winding free<br>
from ribbon wind is possible, even if the difference in wound<br>
diameters varies in winding or plus or minus of the difference in<br>
wound diameters changes.<br>
[0056]<br>
As it will be readily understood from the embodiment,<br>
when the difference in wound diameters exceeds a predetermined<br>
range, the traverse rotating number has to be largely increased,<br>
and the winding angle increases largely.  It is generally<br>
recognised that such quick and large increase of the winding<br>
angle adversely influences upon the yarn quality, and<br>
accordingly, it is preferred that warning sound or warning<br>
signals are sent when, for example, difference in wound diameters<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
which results in the variation of not less than 1  in winding<br>
angles is generated through a certain ribbon jump.<br>
[0057]<br>
For example, when yarn threading operations are done<br>
simultaneously, detection of the following abnormalities is<br>
possible by calculating the package diameters in winding and by<br>
comparing the difference in packaged diameters.<br>
[0058]<br>
Difference in Denier in wound yarns:<br>
Difference in wound diameters increases, and<br>
Difference in wound diameters reverses.<br>
Abnormal contacting pressure:<br>
Difference in wound diameters increases largely.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, example using so<br>
called cam traverse as a traverse device is explained, however,<br>
in the present invention, rotary blade traverse 9a and 9a' way be<br>
used as a traverse device as illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 .<br>
[0059]<br>
Further, as illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, when there are<br>
a plurality of traverse devices 9 and 9' , the plurality of<br>
traverse devices may be controlled by a single traverse control<br>
device, for example, a construction, wherein that the plurality<br>
of traverse devices are connected to each other by means of a<br>
timing belt or gears and are driven by a single motor, is<br>
applied, and by carrying out the present invention, packages free<br>
from ribbon wind can be formed even when the single motor is<br>
commonly used.  Thus, the numbers of inverters and motors which<br>
are relatively expensive can be reduced, and equipment cost can<br>
be decreased.  When it is difficult to commonly use one single<br>
traverse motor due to problems of space and so on, only inverter<br>
may be commonly used and the present invention can be carried<br>
out,  Thus, the number of inverters can be reduced, and equipment<br>
cost can be decreased.<br>
[0060]<br>
Although in the above-described embodiment, a line for a<br>
new winding angle was formed using package with larger wound<br>
diameter as basis from just after avoiding ribbon wind to just<br>
before avoiding ribbon wind, a line for a new winding angle may<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
be formed using package with smaller wound diameter as basis.<br>
Further, although the winding angle line was set by a straight<br>
line, it may be varied along a saw tooth line, for example, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 9 since the change will not adversely affect<br>
on the present invention.<br>
