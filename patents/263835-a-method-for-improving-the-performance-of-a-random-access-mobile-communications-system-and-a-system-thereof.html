Application Serial No. 60/063,024, filed October 23,1997. The above-cited<br>
Applications are useful for illustrating certain important premises and the state of the art<br>
for the present Application, and are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their<br>
entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Technical Field of the Invention<br>
	The present invention relates in general to the mobile telecommunications field<br>
and. in particular, to a method for processing multiple random access mobile-originated<br>
calls.<br>
	Description of Related Art<br>
	The next (so-called "third") generation of mobile communications systems will<br>
be required to provide a broad selection of telecommunications services including<br>
digital voice, video and data, in packet and channel circuit-switched modes. As a result,<br>
the number of calls being made is expected to increase significantly, which will result in<br>
much higher traffic density on random access channels (RACHs). Unfortunately, this<br>
higher traffic density will also result in increased collisions and access failures.<br>
Consequently, the ability to support faster and more efficient random access is a key<br>
requirement in the development of the new generation of mobile communications<br>
systems. In other words, the new generation systems will have to use much faster and<br>
more flexible random access procedures, in order to increase their access success rates<br>
and reduce their access request processing times,<br>
	A European joint development mobile communications system is referred<br>
to as the "Code Division Testbed" (CODIT), In a CODIT-based Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (CDMA) system, a mobile station can gain access to abase station<br>
by first determining that the RACK is available for use. Then, the mobile station<br>
transmits a series of access request preambles (e.g., single 1023 chip symbols) with<br>
increasing power levels until the base station detects the access request, As such,<br>
the mobile station uses a "power ramping" process that increases the power level of<br>
each successive transmitted preamble symbol. As soon as an access request<br>
2<br><br>
preamble is detected, the base station activates a closed loop power control circuit<br>
which functions to control the mobile station's transmitted power level in order to<br>
keep the received signal power from the mobile station at a desired level The<br>
mobile station then transmits its specific access request data. The base station's<br>
receiver despreads and diversity-combines the received signals using, for example,<br>
a RAKE receiver or similar type of processing.<br>
	In many mobile communication systems, a slotted-ALOHA (S-ALOHA)<br>
random access scheme is used, For example, systems operating La accordance with<br>
the IS-95 standard (ANSI J STD-008) use an S-ALOHA random access scheme.<br>
The main difference between the CODIT and IS-95 processes is thai the CODIT<br>
process does not use an S-ALOHA random access scheme- Also, another<br>
difference is that the IS-95 mobile station transmits a complete random access<br>
packet instead of just the preamble. If the base station does not acknowledge the<br>
access request, the IS-95 mobile station re-transmits the entire access request<br>
packet at a higher power level This process continues until the base station<br>
acknowledges tne access request.<br>
In the above-cited Applications and theIS-95 CDMA technical<br>
specifications, different random access methods baaed on S-ALOHA random access<br>
schemes have been described. Essentially (as illustrated in FIGURE 1), using a<br>
basic S-ALOHA scheme, there are well-defined instants in time (tune slots) at which<br>
random access transmissions are allowed to begin. Typically, a mobile station (user)<br>
randomly selects a time slot in which (he transmission of a random access burst (e.g.,<br>
Ul, U2) is to begin. However, the time slots are not pre-allocated to specific users.<br>
Consequently, collisions between the different users random access bursts can occur<br>
(e.g., between U3, U4).<br>
	In e. specific mobile communications system using such an S-ALOHA<br>
random access scheme, such as the method disclosed in the above-cited U.S.<br>
Application Serial No. 08/733,501 (hereinafter, "the '501 Application"), a mobile<br>
station generates and transmits a random access packet. A diagram that illustrates a<br>
frame structure for such a random access packet is shown in FIGURE 2, The<br>
transmitted random access packet ("access request data frame") or "burst"<br>
comprises a preamble {10) and a message part (12).Typically, the preamble does<br>
not include user information and is used in the base station receiver primarily to<br>
facilitate detection of the presence of the random access burst and derive certain<br>
timing information (e.g,, different transmission path delays). Note that, as<br>
3<br><br>
two mobile stations that have selected the same time slot, me concept of burst<br>
"signatures" has been introduced. For example, as described in the 501<br>
Application (see FIGURE 4), the preamble of a random access burst is modulated<br>
with a unique signature pattern. Also, the message part is spread with a code<br>
associated with the signature pattern used. The signature pattern is randomly<br>
selected from a set of patterns that can be, but are not necessarily, orthogonal to each<br>
other. Since a collision can occur only between mobile stations' bursts that are<br>
using the same signature, the risk of a random access collision is reduced in<br>
comparison with other existing schemes. As such, the use of this unique signature<br>
pattern feature, as described and claimed in the 501 Application, provides a<br>
significantly higher throughput efficiency than prior random access schemes.<br>
	In the 024 Application, a mobile station transmits a signature on the Q<br>
branch within the message part of the burst In preparing for the transmission, the<br>
mobile station randomly selects the signature from a set of predetermined<br>
signatures. Again, since a collision can occur only between mobile stations' bursts<br>
that are using the same signature (the primary advantage of the novel use of<br>
signatures in general), the risk of a random access collision is reduced in comparison<br>
with other existing schemes.<br>
	Notably, although the random access systems and methods described in the<br>
above-cited Applications have numerous advantages over prior random access<br>
schemes, a number of problems still exist that remain to be solved. For example,<br>
regardless of the random access method used, a mobile station has to decide just<br>
how much random access transmission power to use. Ideally, a mobile station<br>
should select a transmission power level such that the random access burst is<br>
received at the base station with precisely the power needed for correct decoding of<br>
the random access message, However, for numerous reasons, it is virtually<br>
impossible to ensure that this will be the case.<br>
4<br><br>
	For example, the power of the received burst as required at the base station<br>
is not constant but cart vary (e.g., due to variations in the radio channel<br>
characteristics and the speed of the mobile station). As such, these variations are to<br>
some extent unpredictable and thus unknown to the mobile station. Also, there can<br>
be significant errors in estimating the uplink path-loss. Furthermore, even if a<br>
mobile station can determine the "correct" transmission power level to use, because<br>
of existing hardware limitations, it is impossible to set the actual transmission<br>
power level to precisely the correct value needed.<br>
	Consequently, for the above-described reasons, there is a significant risk<br>
that a random access burst will be received at the base station with too much<br>
power. This condition causes excessive interference for other users and thus reduces<br>
the capacity of the CDMA system. For the same reasons, there is also arisk that a<br>
random access burst will be transmitted with too little power. This condition makes<br>
it impossible for the base station to detect and decode the random access burst.<br>
	In order to reduce the risk of transmitting with too much power, in the afore<br>
mentioned IS-95 CDMA system, the initial random access request is transmitted<br>
with an additional negative power offset (i.e., with a lower power level than the<br>
required transmit power level expected), as shown in FIGURE 5. Referring to<br>
FIGURE 5, the mobile station then re-transmits the random access burst with a.<br>
reduced negative power offset, until the base station acknowledges (ACK) that it has<br>
correctly decoded the random access message ("NACK" denotes so<br>
acknowledgment message transmitted). Typically, the base station's<br>
acknowledgment is based on the calculation of acyclic redundancy check (CRC)<br>
over the random access message. However, note that a new estimate of the required<br>
transmission power may or may not be calculated for each re-transmission.<br>
Consequently, it is only the negative offset that is reduced for each re-transmission.<br>
	A significant problem that exists with the above-described power ramping<br>
approaches is that there is an obvious trade-off between the time delay incurred due<br>
to the mobile station re-transmitting the random access bursts until the base<br>
Station's acknowledgment message is received, and the amount of interference<br>
caused by the random access transmission. As such, with a larger negative initial<br>
power offset, on the average, more re-transmissions will be needed before the<br>
random access burst is received at the base station with sufficient power. On the<br>
other hand, with a smaller initial negative power offset, there is an increased risk<br>
that the random access burst will be received at the base station with too much<br>
5<br><br>
power. On the average, this occurrence will cause more interference for other<br>
users. For reasonably large negative power offsets, the delay until the<br>
acknowledgement of a correctly decoded random access message is transmitted can<br>
be significant, because the base station has to receive an entire random access burst<br>
before it can transmit the acknowledgment message. As described in detail below,<br>
the present invention successfully resolves the above-described problems.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
	In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
method for processing multiple random access requests is provided whereby a base<br><br>
station transmits an acquisition indicator signal, which indicates that the base<br>
station has detected the presence of a random access transmission. For this<br>
exemplary embodiment, the acquisition indicator is generated based on the amount<br>
of energy received on the random access channel (e.g., as opposed to the<br>
correct/incorrect decoding of a random access message). Consequently, the delay<br>
between the beginning of the random access transmission and the beginning of the<br>
acquisition indicator transmission is significantly shorter than the delay to the<br>
beginning of an acknowledgment transmission based on the reception of a correctly<br>
decoded random access message. If a mobile station does not receive a positive<br>
acquisition indicator, the mobile station should interrupt the present transmission<br>
and start to re-transmit the random access burst in the next time slot, while<br>
modifying the transmission power level accordingly between the successive re-<br>
transmissions.<br>
	An important technical advantage of the present invention is that<br>
significantly fester power ramping can be achieved in an S-ALOHA random access<br>
system.<br>
	Another important technical advantage of the present invention is that with<br>
an unchanged initial power offset in an S-ALOHA random access scheme, the<br>
random access delay can be significantly reduced, which improves the system<br>
performance.<br>
Yet another important technical advantage of the present invention is that<br>
for the same delay constraints involved, a larger initial power offset can be used for<br>
one user in an S-ALOHA random access system, which reduces the risk of<br>
excessive interference for other users.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
	The preferred embodiment of the present invention and its advantages are<br>
best understood by referring to FlGUREs 1-8 of the drawings, like numerals being<br>
used for like and corresponding pans of the various drawings.<br>
	Essentially, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a method for processing multiple random access requests is provided<br>
whereby a base station transmits an acquisition indicator signal, which indicates that<br>
the base station has detected the presence of a random access transmission. For this<br>
exemplary embodiment, the acquisition indicator is generated based on the amount<br>
of energy received (or, possibly, also the interference energy) on the random access<br>
channel (e.g., as opposed to the correct/incorrect decoding of a random access<br>
message). Consequently, the delay between the beginning of the random access<br>
transmission and the beginning of the acquisition indicator transmission is<br>
significantly shorter than the delay to the beginning of an acknowledgment signal<br>
transmission based on the reception of a correctly decoded random access message,<br>
If a mobile station does not receive a positive acquisition indicator, the mobile<br>
station should interrupt the present transmission and start to re-transmit the random<br>
access burst in the next time slot, while modifying the transmission power level<br>
accordingly between the successive re-transmissions.<br>
	FIGURE 6 is a block diagram of an exemplary detection section (for one<br>
antenna) that can be used in a base station's (204) receiver to detect the presence of a<br>
random access transmission from a mobile station (202), in accordance with a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary detection section 200<br>
includes a matched filter 206 (e.g., used during the preamble period) which is tuned<br><br>
(matched) to a preamble's spreading code. For this example, the matched filter is<br>
used to detect the presence of the random access burst, despread the preamble part,<br>
and feed the despread signal to an appropriate section of an accumulator 208. Since<br>
each received preamble can include a unique signature pattern, the accumulator 208<br>
includes one unit tuned to one of the possible signature patterns (1-1) that can be<br>
received. The output of each accumulator unit 208(1-1) is coupled to a respective<br>
threshold detection unit 210(1-1). The accumulator unit 208 accumulates the energy<br>
received over the duration of the preamble.<br>
	During the preamble period, if a threshold detection unit 210(1-1) detects an<br>
input signal that exceeds a predetermined detection threshold, that threshold<br>
detection unit outputs a signal. This output signal (indicating detection of sufficient<br>
energy from a received random access burst) is coupled to a respective acquisition<br>
indicator generator circuit 212(1-1), which outputs an acquisition indicator signal (A)<br>
for transmission by the base station.<br>
For the case where a burst is transmitted without a preamble, the matched<br>
filter 206 in FIGURE 6 is matched to the spreading code used on the control part<br>
of the burst (i.e., where a signature is located). However, in this case, the<br>
accumulation performed, by the accumulator 208(1-1) occurs for a specified period of<br>
Lime (e.g., just enough time to provide a good estimate, whether or not the base<br>
station has received a random access burst.<br>
	Notably, the present invention provides a solution that is applicable for those<br>
cases where the random access burst both, does or does not include a preamble.<br>
Specifically a s illustrated by the uplink and downlink transmission diagram shown<br>
in the embodiment of FIGURE 7, in those cases where a preamble is used, if the idle<br>
period in the burst between the preamble (P) and message part is sufficiently large, a<br>
mobile station can receive an acquisition indicator (A) transmitted by the base station<br>
during that idle period. However, in accordance with an underlying principle of this<br>
exemplary embodiment, the mobile station will not transmit the message part (Mt) of<br>
the random access burst until an acquisition indicator (A1) is received (no acquisition<br>
indicator transmission is denoted by "NA"). Instead of transmitting the message part<br>
of the burst if no acquisition indicator is received (e.g.,NA1, NA2, the mobile station<br>
will continue to transmit a new preamble (e.g., P2, P3).<br>
As illustrated by the uplink and downlink transmission, diagram shown in<br>
FIGURE 8, in those cases where a preamble is not used in a random access burst (or,<br>
for example, the idle period between the preamble and message part is too short in<br>
duration), a mobile station will receive the base station's transmitted acquisition<br>
indicator (A;) during the mobile station's transmission of a message part (M3) of the<br>
burst. However, in accordance with the principles of this exemplary embodiment, if<br>
9<br><br>
no acquisition indicator is received (e.g., NA,, NA2) at a predetermined instant of<br>
tune, the mobile station will interrupt its transmission of the message part (M1, M2<br>
of the random access burst, and re-transmit the random access burst in the next time<br>
slot until an acquisition indicator (A1) is received.<br>
	In a different aspect of the present invention, for those cases where signatures<br>
are used in the random access scheme, each acquisition indicator transmitted by a<br>
base station can indicate reception of a corresponding signature (transmitted from a<br>
mobile station). Alternatively, a plurality of signatures can share one acquisition<br>
indicator In this case, the base station's transmission of the acquisition indicator<br>
indicates that at least one of the corresponding signatures (transmitted from a<br>
mobile station) has been received. In another aspect of the present invention, a<br>
mobile station can also select (randomly or non-randomly) a new signature and/or a<br>
new RACH for each burst re-transmission (until an acquisition indicator is received),<br>
A base station can transmit an acquisition indicator signal on a downlink<br>
physical channel. Such a physical channel can be dedicated and used only for<br>
transmissions of acquisition indicator signals or, for example, the acquisition<br>
indicator signals can be rune-multiplexed with other signals on one physical channel<br>
or on a plurality of different physical channels. As such, a physical channel used for<br>
transmission of an acquisition indicator signal can be either orthogonal or non-<br>
orthogonal to other downlink physical channels used by the mobile communication<br>
system.<br>
	In another aspect of the present invention, a base station can transmit an<br>
acquisition indicator as a type of "on-off " signal. In other words, the base station<br>
transmits the signal only if the base station has detected a random access burst, and<br>
does not transmit the signal if a random access burst has not been detected. For<br>
example, the base station can transmit acquisition indicator signals as different<br>
orthogonal cods words for different signatures. In that case, the base station's<br>
transmission of a specific code word would indicate the base station's acquisition of<br>
a random access signal with the corresponding signature. Alternatively , a plurality<br>
of signatures can share one acquisition indicator. In This case, the base station's<br>
transmission of the acquisition indicator indicates that at least one of the<br>
corresponding signatures has been received.<br>
	Although a preferred embodiment of the method and apparatus of the present<br>
invention has been illustrated in the accompanying Drawings and described in the<br>
foregoing Detailed Description, it will be understood that the invention is not limited <br>
to the embodiment disclosed, but is capable of numerous rearrangements,<br>

	transmitting a preamble part of a random access request, said preamble being<br>
	modulated with a signature pattern randomly selected from a set of patterns;<br>
	receiving an indicator signal (NA1, NA2, A) associated with the selected signature and<br>
	indicating that a base station has detected a presence of said random access request<br>
	prior to decoding of the random access request;<br>
	transmitting a message part of the random access request in response to receiving said<br>
	indicator signal.<br>
6. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein said indicator signal is associated with a unique<br>
signature.<br>
7. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein said indicator signal is associated with a<br>
plurality of unique signatures<br>
11<br><br>
-2-<br>
8. A method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the method includes retransmitting the<br>
preamble if no indicator signal is received by a predetermined instant of time.<br>
Dated this 16th day of January 2006<br><br>
A method for processing multiple random access requests is disclosed in which a base<br>
station (204) transmits an acquisition indicator signal (A), which indicates that the<br>
base station (204) has detected the presence of a random access transmission (P.M).<br>
The acquisition indicator (A) can be generated based (212) on the amount of energy<br>
received (210) on the random access channel (e.g., as opposed to the correct/incorrect<br>
decoding of a random access message). Consequently, the delay between the beginning<br>
of the random access transmission (P.M) and the beginning of the acquisition indicator<br>
transmissions (A) is significantly shorter than the delay to the beginning of an<br>
acknowledgement transmission based on the reception of a correctly decoded random<br>
access message. If a mobile station (202) does not receive a positive acquisition<br>
indicator (A), it should interrupt the present transmission and start to retransmit the<br>
random access burst in the next time slot, while modifying the transmission power<br>
level accordingly between the successive retransmissions.<br></td>
