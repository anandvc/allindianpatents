				<td>The present invention has for an object a machine tor making air cushions for packaging<br>
from a tubular film wound on a reel, notably for cushioning delicate and fragile objects.<br>
The document WO 99/61232 contains a history of the improvements made to the types of<br>
machine which form the subject of the present invention and defines a machine for<br>
making air cushions for packaging which do not exhibit the defects of the prior art.<br>
However, the machine defined in document WO 99/61232 still has some problems,<br>
particularly in relation to the tension of the tubular film intended for making the air<br>
cushions. This tension is very important for allowing good perforation of the film and<br>
hence a standard filling of the cushions.<br>
The invention has for an object to provide a machine intended for the manufacture of air<br>
cushions for packaging which represents a marked improvement over the known<br>
machines, particularly in respect of the tension of the film, so as to ensure reliable<br>
operation of the machine in respect of both quality and durability.<br>
These goals are achieved with the machine for making air cushions for packaging from<br>
tubular film wound on a reel in accordance with the invention, said machine comprising a<br>
frame, spacing means arranged within said tubular film to separate the walls, traction<br>
means to draw the tubular film and an inflating and welding device having at least one<br>
hollow needle for inflation, means to prevent the air escaping toward said reel, that is to<br>
say, upstream, said means to prevent the escape of air being placed between the means<br>
provided within the said film and the reel, the inflating and welding device being placed<br>
after the means provided within said film and before the means for drawing said film to<br>
pull the tubular film through the inflating and welding device, the hollow needle of the<br>
inflating and welding device being attached to a first beam located on one side of the said<br>
film controlled by a first actuator and two heating elements located upstream and<br>
downstream of the hollow needle on a second beam located on the other side of said film<br>
controlled by a second actuator, characterised in that the means for preventing the air<br>
introduced into the tubular film from escaping towards the said reel, that is to say.<br>
upstream, comprise an elongated element extending in a transverse direction rclati\e to<br>
the film attached to said first beam in such a way as to be held away from said film during<br>
the movement of the latter and being introduced into a recess provided in a plate in the<br>
frame of the machine to force said film into the recess to form a sealed fold in the latter.<br>
The invention will be better understood and its advantages will appear more clearly from<br>
a reading of the description of the method of carrying the invention into effect, which is<br>
given solely by way of example, and by means of the drawings in which:<br>
figure 1 represents a schematic view of a machine in accordance with the invention,<br>
figure 2 shows the section A-A of figure I showing the traction device as seen from<br>
above.<br>
figures 3 a, b and c provide a diagrammatic representation of the different phases of<br>
operation of the machine shown in figure 1.<br>
As can be seen from the schematic view of figure 1, one embodiment of the machine in<br>
accordance with the invention includes means 8 to draw the tubular film 1, which can be<br>
of any material which can be welded by thermal welding, for example, plastic. The film is<br>
pulled in the direction of the arrow 16 from a reel, which is not shown. The film 1 first<br>
passes over a return roller 17 which displaces it vertically on the drawing, then it passes<br>
in front of a plate 2 on the frame comprising a recess 2a. The recess 2a in the plate 2 is<br>
arranged opposite an elongate element 2b attached to a first beam 12. The tubular film 1<br>
then encounters a body 3 introduced into the interior of the tubular film 1 through the<br>
opening at the end of the film 1 at the time when the machine is first started up. The body<br>
3 rests on two bars or rods 4 disposed outside said film 1 and separated by a distance less<br>
than the external diameter of the body 3. The body 3 is, for example, a cylinder of plastic<br>
material of about 1 cm in diameter, held in place solely by gravity on the two rods 4. Just<br>
after its passage around the body 3 the film 1 passes through the inflating and welding<br>
device.<br>
The inflating and welding device comprises at least one hollow needle 5 connected to<br>
inflating means (for example, a compressor, not shown) and fixed to a first beam 12<br>
articulated on an axis 15 and thermal pressure welding means 6 attached to a second<br>
beam 10 articulated on an axis 14. The oscillating movement of the beam 12 is controlled<br>
by a first actuator 13 and the oscillating movement of the beam 10 by a second actuator<br>
The welding means 6 consist of two heating bars (For example, using thermal resistance)<br>
disposed one abo\e the other, of a length at least equal to the width of the tubular fiIm I<br>
and placed on one side of said Him opposite thrust bars 7 placed one abo\ e the other on<br>
the opposite side, the hollow needle 5 being arranged between thrust bars 7. The inflating<br>
and welding de\ ice also comprises points or a serrated knife 18 between the heating bars<br>
to perforate or partially cut the tubular film I in order to facilitate its separation.<br>
In figure 2 the film traction device X comprises two cylinders 19. 19a each having ends of<br>
greater diameter than that of their central parts 20. 20a. The terminal parts of the cylinders<br>
19, 19a are coaled with flexible and elastic material, for example, foam rubber. Cylinders<br>
19. 19a are in contact with one another at their extremities leaving in their central part a<br>
space such that the two walls of the tubular film I can remain separated after inflation.<br>
The two cylinders arc caused to rotate by a motor 23 by means of gears 24 ami 2 I.<br>
The operation of the machine will be explained with the aid of figures 3a. 3b and 3c. The<br>
elements represented are the same as those of figure 1: the reference symbols ha\e not<br>
been repeated in order not to obscure the draw ings. First, the body 3 is introduced<br>
through the opening of the end of the said tubular film into the interior of the latter and<br>
the film is drawn between the bars 4. then through the driving means S. The welding<br>
device 6. 7 is then operated so as to close the end of the tubular film 1 by means of a weld<br>
29 (Fig. 3). The machine is ready to operate, as shown in figure 3a. The actuator 13<br>
operates the beam 12 so as to displace the element 2b in the direction of the arrow 31<br>
which enters into the recess 2a in the plate 2 of the frame of the machine. The element 2b<br>
comprises a strip having a thickness substantially less than the opening of the recess 2a so<br>
that the strip can introduce the two walls of the tube 1 into the recess 2a. When the film 1<br>
is introduced into the recess 2a it creates a tension on the latter. In effect, the film 1 is<br>
retained on the roller I 7 and in the traction device X, this tension improves the separation<br>
of the two walls of the tubular film 1.<br>
Immediately after the element 2b has been introduced into the recess 2a, the needle 5 is<br>
introduced in the direction of the arrow 27 (figure 3b) into the tubular film 1 by the<br>
movement of the beam I 2 effected by the actuator 1 3, penetrating only one wall because<br>
the region where it is introduced is immediately after the body 3 and walls of the tubular<br>
film have been well separated. Inflation is then effected, air being retained by the weld 29<br>
and by the fold formed in the recess 2a in the plate 2 by the element 2b.<br>
Welding is then effected, the welding bars 6 being displaced in the direction of the ;irrow<br>
2X (figure 3c) by the beam 10 mo\ed by the actuator I I so as to come to rest on the thrust<br>
bars 7 pinching the tubular film between them and the thrust bars. Welding can then lake<br>
place. The welding bars are then heated in order to effect sealing of the two walls of (he<br>
tubular film to form a cushion 30. During the welding, the needle 5 and the element 2b<br>
are withdrawn rearwards bv a reverse movement of the beam 12 effected by the actuator<br>
13. The welding bars are then withdrawn rearwards by a reverse movement of the beam<br>
10 effected by the actuator 1 1. The cushion 30 is then pulled on its sides by cylinders 8 as<br>
indicated in figure 2 for a distance equal to the length of a cushion.<br>
The cycle described above can then restart because it is again in the position shown in<br>
figure 3a.<br>
It is to be understood that the description of the method of carrying the invention into<br>
effect given above is provided only by way of example. Thus all the variations relating to<br>
the shape of the element intended to enter the recess to hold the film arc comprised within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
