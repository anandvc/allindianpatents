COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10}<br>
AN  IMPROVED  BODY  FOR  ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONICS  SWITCHES  &amp; SOCKETS<br>
&amp;<br>
MANOJ HANSRAJ GAD A, HANSRAJ SHIVA JI GAD Of AEROLITE INDUSTRIES 5, SATI INDUSTRIAL ESTATE I. B. PATEL ROAD, GOREGAON (EAST), MUMBAI - 400 063 MAHARASHTRA, India INDIANS<br>
GRANTED<br>
15-9-2005<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br><br>
The invention relates to an improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets. More particularly the invention relates to an improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets with a view to give different colour combination of flap as well as to conceal the fastening screw.<br>
The conventional installation of electrical socket, switch, fuse and indicator are individually installed with a very little chance match with the panel. Today's interior decorations has changed the concept of all together want to change frequently the door pannel thereby there is need to develop electrical Switch, Sockets, Fuses and Indicators has been deviced with conceal those visualable screw and to make the product more attractive by means of colourful flap to match with the pannel. The conceal varing system which advent the box type body structure to fit into the grooves in the pannel and fixed by screwing means thereby only the front surface of the body with switched sockets as visionable on the pannel.<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a decorative sets of inter changeable flap of any color to suit the panel for inter decoration.<br>
The another object of the invention is to conceal the fixing screw at the 4 corners of the body to give a better asthetic look of the body.<br>
Accordingly there is provided an improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets comprising a front flat surface having outwardly projected flange at a distance from the flat portion having plurality of groove to accommodate the brass part of the socket/ switches inserted from the front side and a rectangular cover having matching grooves is placed from the front side and screwed from the open ended back side; said back side have square moulded flat form at a distance from the flat periphery with plurality of groove to accommodate the brass part of the switches/ sockets; a flap member of any colour having single groove if is press fit by inter locking means on the outer periphery the flat front surface. An improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets wherein the body of sockets, switches, are made of electrically insulated moulded materials preferably urea formaldehyde   (thermoset plastic) and polycarbonate. An improved, body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets wherein the flap is a box type structure of any colour<br><br>
having a single central groove having open end at back with outwardly projected flange with plurality of notches on the inner side of the flange. An improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets wherein the flap may have side cutting to match with the projected moulded body.<br>
The invention will now be clear from the following description in the figure 1 to 6 in the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figure 1 : is a front view of the an improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets without flap.<br>
Figure 2 : is a front view of the an improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets with flap,<br>
Figure 3 : is a sectional view of the an improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets<br>
Figure 4 : is a back view of the an improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets<br>
Figure 5 : is a back view of the flap<br>
Figure 6 : is a front view of the flap which is placed from the face side<br>
Referring to figure 1 to 6 an improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets consist of body (1) having a outer flat portion (2) box type depression (3) with outwardly projected flange (4) from the front flat portion (2) at the front surface (5) with plurality of groove (6) to accommodate the brass part of the switches , socket and fastening means ; a moulded front piece (10) with matching grooves to fit on the grooves of box type depression (3) which is screwed from the back. The flat portion is provided with minute hubs (11) on its periphery for press fitting of flap (12) of any color fitted on the periphery of the flap portion by the press fit. The body of sockets, switches are made of electrically<br><br>
insulated moulded materials preferably urea formaldehyde (thermoset plastic) &amp; polycarbonate. As shown in fig 5 &amp; 6, the flap (12) is a box type structure of any colour having single central groove (13) having open end at back with outwardly projected flange (14) with plurality of notches (15) on the inner side of the flange. Flap may have side cutting (16) to match with the projected moulded body.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrated and not in a limiting sense.<br><br>
CLAIM :-<br>
1.	An improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets comprising a front flat surface (2) having outwardly projected flange (4) at a distance from the flat portion having box type depression (3) with plurality of groove to accommodate the brass part of the socket/ switches inserted from the front side and a rectangular cover (10) having matching grooves is placed from the front side to fit on the grooves of box type depression (3) and screwed from the open ended back side; said back side have square moulded flat form at a distance from the flat periphery with plurality of groove to accommodate the brass part of the switches/ sockets; a flap member (12) of any colour having single groove (13) is press fit by inter locking means on the outer periphery of the flat front surface (2).<br>
2.	An improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets as claimed in claim 1 wherein the body of sockets, switches, are made of electrically insulated moulded materials preferably urea formaldehyde .  (thermoset plastic) and polycarbonate.<br>
3.	An improved body for electrical/electronic switch &amp; sockets as claimed in claim 1 wherein the flap (12) is a box type structure of any colour having a single central groove (13) having open end at back with outwardly projected flange (14) with plurality of notches (15) on the inner side of the flange.<br>
4.	An improved body for electrical/ electronic switch &amp; sockets as claimednn claim 3 wherein the flap may have side cutting (16) to match with the projected moulded body.<br>
