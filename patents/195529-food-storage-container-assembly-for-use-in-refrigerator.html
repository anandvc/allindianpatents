BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
-1        Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a food storage container assembly for a refrigerator by which a receiving space of a storage container mounted in a storage space of the refrigerator is partitioned and utilized for individual use thereof<br>
-2   Description of the Prior Art<br>
FIG   1  is a schematic sectional view showing the constitution of a conventional refrigerator As shown in the figure, a freezing chamber 2 and a refrigerating chamber 4, which serve as a storage space, are separated within a refrigerator body 1 by a barrier 5 The freezing and refrigerating chambers 2, 4 are selectively opened and closed by doors 7, 7', respectively<br>
Since a plurality of shelves 9 are installed at a predetermined height interval within the refrigerating chamber 4, articles to be stored can be put onto the shelves 9 In general, a storage container 10 is further installed at a bottom portion within the refrigerating chamber 4 in a state where it is separately partitioned from the refrigerating chamber 4 Vegetable or fruit is generally stored within the storage container 10 The storage container 10 is covered at a top portion thereof with the lowermost shelf 9 and can be slid in and out like a drawer<br>
Therefore, in order for a user to put foodstuffs into or out of the storage container 10, the user should pun the storage container 10 forwardly so that the open top portion of the storage container can be exposed to the outside However, since the conventional storage container 10 with the receiving space formed therein is not partitioned into separate regions, the following problems are produced when the user intends to store a variety of foodstuffs together in the container<br>
In such a case, for example, when the various foodstuffs are stored in the container, the foodstuffs arc mixed with one another and stacked one above another since they cannot<br><br>
2<br>
be grouped according to the kinds thereof Therefore, a great deal of inconvenience is inevitably produced when the user picks out specific food from the foodstuffs stored in the storage container 10 Further, it is also very inconvenient for the user to select correct positions where the respective foodstuffs are stored<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is contemplated to solve the above problems An object of the present invention is to provide a food storage container assembly by which a receiving space of a storage container mounted into a storage space of a refrigerator is partitioned into separate regions for their respective uses<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a food storage container assembly by which a receiving space of a storage container can be variously partitioned into separate regions according to articles to be stored in the storage container<br>
According to one aspect, for achieving the above objects, the present invention provides a food storage container assembly installed in a storage space within a refrigerator for separately storing foodstuffs, comprising a container body which is installed within the storage space, is open at the top thereof, and has a receiving space for separately storing the foodstuffs therein, and a partitioned storage unit having supporting frames which are put onto an upper end of the container body and a partitioned space defining member which is suspended from the supporting frames, can be changed into various shapes, and forms separate storing space within the receiving space for holding the foodstuffs therein<br>
Preferably, a pair of the supporting frames may be disposed at both ends of the partitioned space defining member, respectively, so that both ends thereof are put onto and supported by the upper end of the container body<br>
Further, mounting grooves into which both ends of each of the supporting frames are seated may be formed at a predetermined interval on opposite sides of the upper ends of the container body by which the supporting frames are supported<br>
Furthermore, the partitioned space defining member may be a net<br>
Preferably, the container body   may   be   provided at a front surface thereof with a<br><br>
3<br>
handle and is installed within the storage space such that it can be slid in and out in the same manner as a drawer<br>
According to the present invention, the foodstuffs can be stored in the partitioned storage unit and the receiving space within the container body, respectively Thus, the foodstuffs can be separately stored Moreover, it is expected an advantage in that the foodstuffs are conveniently received and drawn out<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment given in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
FIG I is a sectional view showing the internal constitution of a conventional refrigerator,<br>
FIG 2 is a perspective view of a food storage container assembly for a refrigerator according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
FIG 3 is a view showing a state where the food storage container assembly according to the embodiment of the present invention is used,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings,<br>
FIG 2 is a perspective view of a food storage container assembly according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention As shown in the figure, the food storage container assembly 20 is installed into a storage space within a refrigerator in such a manner that It call be slid into or out of the storage space like a drawer For example, the food storage container assembly is installed at a bottom portion of a refrigerating chamber of the refrigerator and used as a space in which vegetable or fruit is stored<br>
A container body 22 of the food storage container assembly 20 has an upwardly opened receiving space 24 The container body 22 is generally made of a transparent synthetic resin material   The receiving space 24 is a region   into which articles to be<br><br>
4<br>
stored are put A top portion of the receiving space 24, i e , a top face of the container body 22, is covered with a separate covering or a shelf installed within the refrigerating chamber of the refrigerator Thus, if the container body 22 is slid forwardly out of the refrigerating chamber like the drawer, the receiving space 24 is opened<br>
Therefore, in order to cause the container body 22 to be slid out like the drawer, a handle 26 is formed at a front portion of the container body 22 The handle 26 is a part which the user grasps when he/she takes out the container body 22 An upper frame 28 is separately formed and mounted to an upper end of the container body 22 so as to reinforce the upper end of the container body 22 In such a case, a plurality of mounting grooves 29 may be formed on the upper frame 28 at a predetermined interval in a fore and aft direction Further, if design conditions are changed, the plurality of mounting groves 29 may be formed directly on the upper end of the container body 22 without additionally using the upper frame 28<br>
A partitioned storage unit 30 is provided in the receiving space 24 of the container body 22 The partitioned storage unit 30 is a part for causing the storage space 24 to be partitioned into some regions for separately storing the articles therein The partitioned storage unit 30 is composed of supporting frames 32 and it partitioned space defining member 34<br>
The supporting frame 32 takes the shape of bars having a length such that both ends thereof can be put onto opposite ends of the upper frame 28 of the container body 22, respectively The supporting frames 32 are made into a pair so that they are coupled to both ends of the partitioned space defining member 34 At least one supporting frame 32 is constructed such that both ends thereof have a thickness enough to be seated into the mounting grooves 29 Although it has been shown in the figure of the present embodiment that protrusions are formed at the portions of the ends of the supporting frames 32 to be seated into the mounting grooves 29, it is not necessarily limited thereto Any types of seating means may be used in the present invention, so long as the supporting frames 32 can be seated and fixed into the mounting grooves 29<br>
The partitioned space defining member 34 serves to contain and hold the stored articles, and   its shape  can   be  changed  freely  to   a  certain extent    Preferably, the partitioned<br><br>
5<br>
space defining member 34 is in the form of a net The reason is that the net can be freely changed in its shape and does not obstruct a user's field of vision As the partitioned space defining member 34, a sheet made of transparent and flexible synthetic resin material may be used instead of the net<br>
The operation of the food storage container assembly for use in the refrigerator according to the present invention constructed as such will be hereinafter explained in detail<br>
In the present invention, the container body 22 is installed such that it can be slid into and out of the lower end of the refrigerating chamber in the same manner as the drawer Further, when the container body 22 is received within the refrigerating chamber, the top portion of the receiving space 24 is covered with the shelf or additional covering<br>
Therefore, if the user intends to put the stored articles into and out of the container body 22, he/she should grasp the handle 26 and pull out the container body 22 so that the container body is drawn out from the refrigerating chamber Consequently, the top portion of the container body 22 is opened and thus the storage space 24 is also opened<br>
Furthermore, the partitioned storage unit 30 allows the storage space 24 to be partitioned into several separate spaces That is, a size of the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 is determined by placing the supporting frames 32 coupled to the two ends of the partitioned space defining member 34 onto desired positions on the upper frame 28, respectively A position of the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 varies according to the positions where the supporting frames 32 are placed<br>
That is, if the position of the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 is to be located at a front side of the storage space 24, the ends of the respective supporting frames 32 should be seated into the relevant mounting grooves 29 on the upper frame 28 corresponding to a front side of the container body 22, as shown in a solid line in FIG 3 On the other hand, if the position of the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 is to be located at a rear side of the storage space 24, the ends of the supporting frames 32 should be seated into the mounting grooves 29 formed on a rear side of the container body 22 as shown in a dotted line in FIG 3<br>
As mentioned above, if the ends of the supporting frames 32 of the partitioned<br><br>
6<br>
storage unit 30 are seated into the mounting grooves 29 formed at desired positions on the upper frame 28, the position of the partitioned storage unit 30 can be correctly maintained even though the container body 22 is moved<br>
In the meantime, if an interval between the supporting frames 32 of which ends are seated into the mounting grooves 29 is increased (upto a certain length), the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 can be relatively enlarged Of course, if the interval between the supporting frames 32 is too large, the space defined by the partitioned storage unit 30 is of shallow-depth and is reduced<br>
Accordingly, the user can adjust the interval between the supporting frames 32 according to a size or volume of the articles stored in the partitioned storage unit 30 so that the receiving space can be more efficiently utilized<br>
In addition, a plurality of the partitioned storage units 30 may be employed As a result, the receiving space 24 can be partitioned into a number of spaces, and thus, many kinds of articles can be separately stored<br>
According to the present invention, the partitioned storage unit is mounted to the container body so that the receiving space can be partitioned into several storing regions, Thus, it is possible to separately store the foodstuffs in the several storing regions<br>
Accordingly, if the foodstuffs are separately stored in the partitioned receiving spaces, there is an advantage in that the foodstuffs can be put into and out of the spaces<br>
It can be understood from the above that a basic technical spirit of the present invention is to construct the partitioned storage unit 30 in such a manner that the partitioned storage unit is put on across the upper end of the container body 22 It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made within the scope of the technical spirit of the invention<br>
For example, although it has been described in the illustrated embodiment that the supporting frames 32 are mounted to the container body 22 in the fore and aft direction, it will be apparent that the supporting frames 32 of the partitioned storage unit 30 can be arranged laterally to the container body<br><br>
