				<td>Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring low gauge pressure and low differential pressure with resolution approaching one micron WC (10 mP). The measurement of low AP or low gauge pressure with high resolution and accuracy is required both in industrial as well as scientific work. Low AP is generated in low flows (mass / (unit area) (unit time)) e.g., flows in big ducts, furnaces, structured packing, capillary tubes etc. These gauge pressures or differential pressures can be around fraction of mmWC and these should be measured with a system which has a resolution and accuracy at least one or two orders better than 0.1 mmWC.<br>
The usual apparatus employed are<br>
1.	Micromanometefs<br>
2.	Low range differential pressure transmitters<br>
Micromanometers are manometers with some modification to sense the small changes in the height of liquid. These modifications can be optical, two liquids with density very close to each other or inclined tube or electromagnetic type. In all such apparatus going below 0.1 mmWC is not very easy. Low range differential pressure transmitters are very common in industrial use but their resolution is also limited to 0.1 mm WC. But these instruments need calibration with instruments that have better accuracy and resolution down to 0.01 or 0.001 mmWC.<br>
Neither of the above mentioned high quality instruments is available indigenously and cost of the imported instruments can easily go to a few lacs. A similar instrument from DEBRO, Germany costs Rs.3.5 Lac. Resolution of the instrument is 0. 1 rnmWC for general measurements.<br>
Description of the related art:<br>
The usual apparatuses employed to measure low differential pressure are:<br>
1.	MICROMANOMETERS BASED ON LIQUID LEVELS:<br>
These instruments basically use displacement of liquid level and differential pressure. This displacement is amplified using several techniques, e.g., inclined tube, dual liquid and more sensitivity deflection are used to measure the change in level. These techniques can be optical, electronic or based upon acoustic or Laser interferometry.<br>
Such an apparatus becomes costlier and costlier as the techniques become more and more sensitive and specific.<br>
2.	LOW RANGE PRESSURE TRANSDUCERS:<br>
These instruments are not primary instruments. They work on change of some physical parameter with pressure. This can be resistance, capacitance, inductance or piezo electric effect. Pressure is converted to force and force is measured by the change in these parameters. Once again instrument needs calibration and its cost is high due to specific and important application. Sophistication e.g., 'Smart' or 'Intelligent' also increase the cost with relatively less benefit to the user.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided an apparatus for measuring low gauge pressure and low differential pressure with resolution approaching one micron WC, said apparatus comprising:<br>
means to hold the liquid for sealing the pressure;<br>
at least one means for measuring pressure located within the means to hold the<br>
liquid; and<br>
means for transferring force connected to the means for measuring pressure for calibrating balance therein.<br>
The apparatus tested and described measures force generated by differential pressure on an area, Force is measured using a good quality laboratory balance. A<br><br>
liquid is used to provide seal between the two pressures.<br>
As XF = A x AP         Where A is the area on which AP is effective. Increase<br>
in area 'A results in larger force. 'A' can be considered as Amplifier's gain.<br>
The benefits of the present invention is as follows:-<br>
1.	Much higher sensitivity than the usual instruments used for the same purpose.<br>
2.	Ease of fabrication. Anybody can assemble it using plastics in a few hours time<br>
without requiring sophisticated tools.<br>
3.	Extremely low cost.<br>
4.	Linear response.<br>
5.	Calibration of the balance with standard weights is easier as compared to<br>
generating low value standard pressure.<br>
The subject invention relates to an apparatus for measuring low gauge pressure and low differential pressure with resolution approaching one micron WC, said apparatus comprising holding means to hold the liquid for sealing the pressure; at least one pressure measuring means for measuring pressure located within the means to hold the liquid; and force transferring means for transferring force connected to the said pressure measuring means for calibrating balance therein.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings; -<br>
The Apparatus of the present invention consists of three vessels A, B, C of diameters DA&gt; DB &gt; DC. Vessel A holds the liquid for sealing the pressures. Vessel B and C make two chambers to which pressures to be measured are connected.<br>
Force is generated due to differential pressure across vessel C. This force F = n Dc2 x (Pb - PC)<br>
This force is transferred to the balance through suitable links.<br>
If only gauge pressure is to be measured then vessel B is redundant.<br>
The factors, which can affect the accuracy and resolution, are<br>
1.	Changes in the calibration of balance.<br>
2.	Effect of ambient temperature on 'Dc' diameter of the measuring vessel.   It will<br>
affect the calibration.<br>
3.	Sticking of liquid to surface of measuring vessel C when liquid moves in or out.<br>
It will affect the zero adjustment.<br>
4.	Effect  of buoyancy  changes  due  to  changes  in  the  liquid  height  in  the<br>
measuring vessel.   It will affect the linearity.<br>
5.	Changes in the surface tension and contact angle of the surface, of vessel 'C',<br>
which comes in contact with liquid.  It will affect the zero adjustment.<br>
6.	Condensation of sealing liquid on vessel C. It will affect zero of the instrument.<br>
A high quality balance with built in calibration and master weights are required to avoid problems due to changes in the calibration of balance as mentioned 'in '1' above.<br>
Measuring vessel should be thin walled and of material for which	co-<br>
efficient of Thermal Expansion is very small e.g., Invar. The surface of this vessel, which is to come in contact with the sealing liquid, should be coated with Teflon. These changes will reduce the effects mentioned in 3,4 and 5 above. For higher AP mercury can be used as a sealing liquid.<br>
The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
