				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR TACTILE CUEING OF AIRCRAFT CONTROLS<br>
Technical Reid<br>
The present invention relates to aircraft control systems. In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to tactile cueing of aircraft control systems.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Currently, the only method to monitor engine and rotor performance of a<br>
helicopter or other rotorcraft in flight is visually, through the information displayed on<br>
various instruments, and/or audibly, with the use of synthesized speech, recorded<br>
messages, tones, whistles, etc. These methods require the pilot to scan the<br>
instruments or expend cognitive power discerning the intent of the audible feedback.<br>
During high workload maneuvers, such as high speed turns and precision hover near<br>
external hazards (buildings, vegetation, power lines, etc.), the pilot must maintain his<br>
gaze outside of the cockpit. Requiring the pilot to break that gaze to look at an<br>
instrument or caution light creates a high risk. Parameter condition is achieved at<br>
the expense of aircraft situational awareness. One problem with these monitoring<br>
methods is that the pilot must stay informed of certain operating parameters,<br>
because exceeding the operational limits of these parameters can lead to significant<br>
degradation of aircraft performance and/or failure of vital aircraft components.<br>
Over the years, many different methods have been developed to address this<br>
problem. These methods can be categorized broadly into three classes. In the first<br>
class, which is most often implemented with fly-by-wire systems, the pilot's control<br>
inputs are electronically interrupted, and only as much of the pilot's inputs as are<br>
allowed are passed to the control system, so that the aircraft will not exceed any<br>
limits when responding. With the methods of this class, the pilot retains full control<br>
motion, but his authority is usurped. Therefore, this method does not really address<br>
the problem of keeping the pilot informed of proximity to a limit. Instead, it imposes a<br>
rigid set of rules that describe the flight envelope.<br>
In the second class of monitoring methods, a tactile cue that retards the<br>
motion of the control, referred to as a "hard stop," is provided. Such a hard stop is<br>
almost universally rejected.<br>
In the third class of methods, a tactile cue that shakes the control is provided,<br>
in these methods, the tactile cue is only a classifier, i.e., either the pilot is violating a<br>
limit, or he is not. There is no "leading" information or forewarning. These methods<br>
are typically the most easy to implement, but they do not provide any information<br>
regarding the degree of limit exceedance.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
There is a need for a tactile cueing system for an aircraft control system that<br>
provides limit proximity information to the pilot on a continuous basis, without<br>
diverting the pilot's attention from the primary task of flying the aircraft, without<br>
interfering with the pilot's control motion, and without artificially changing the<br>
sensitivity of the aircraft to the pilot's control inputs.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a tactile cueing<br>
system for an aircraft control system that provides limit proximity information to the<br>
pilot on a continuous basis, without diverting the pilot's attention from the primary<br>
task of flying the aircraft, without interfering with the pilot's control motion, and<br>
without artificially changing the sensitivity of the aircraft to the pilot's control inputs.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a tactile cueing system<br>
for an aircraft control system that can be mechanically and electrically retrofitted to<br>
existing aircraft.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a tactile cueing<br>
system for an aircraft control system that utilizes existing processing and aircraft<br>
data resources commonly utilized in Flight Data Recorder (FDR) systems and Health<br>
and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS).<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a tactile cueing<br>
system for an aircraft control system that allows "eyes-out-the-cockpit" operation<br>
during demanding maneuvers utilizing the full torque envelope of an aircraft.<br>
These objects are achieved by providing a simple and cost effective<br>
mechanical spring and electric motor system that generates the desired tactile force<br>
cueing to the aircraft control system. The method and apparatus for tactile cueing of<br>
aircraft controls according to the present invention comprises a parameter prediction<br>
and a "soft-stop" tactile cue.<br>
The parameter prediction uses a computer, associated software, and sensors<br>
of control position, engine parameters, and rotor performance to predict a future<br>
value of certain parameters based upon current values. Any number of algorithms<br>
can be applied to the prediction problem, including, but not limited to, Kalman<br>
filtering, extended Kalman filtering, linear prediction, trending, multi-variable surface<br>
fits of measured data, simple analytical expressions, artificial neural networks, and<br>
fuzzy logic. Some of the sensors measure current values of air data, such as<br>
airspeed and rate of descent. Other sensors measure performance parameters,<br>
such as engine torque, exhaust gas temperature, and rotor speed. Still other<br>
sensors measure pilot inputs through control displacement and rate information. All<br>
of this sensed data is sent to the aircraft's flight control computers to prepare the<br>
data for analysis.<br>
Based on the selected algorithm, the parameter prediction is made of a future<br>
value of the desired performance parameters. This predicted value is then passed to<br>
a soft-stop cueing algorithm. The soft-stop algorithm is a "floating ground" algorithm<br>
that does not require additional sensed positions of either side of the spring<br>
cartridge. This reduces the cost of the system and increases reliability by reducing<br>
complexity. The use of a stepper motor combines braking capability and precise<br>
position control of the "floating ground" side of the spring cartridge without the<br>
requirement of additional sensors. Although the present invention is described<br>
below with respect to engine torque management, it will be appreciated that the<br>
method and apparatus of the present invention may be used to manage other aircraft<br>
parameters, such as rotor speed and engine temperature, or any other aircraft<br>
operational parameter that requires limiting and/or reducing control inputs.<br>
The soft-stop tactile cue is achieved by use of a force gradient spring<br>
cartridge placed in parallel with an existing control linkage. One end of the spring<br>
cartridge is attached to the existing control linkage, and the other end of the spring<br>
cartridge is attached to an actuator arm of a stepper motor. A microswitch is placed<br>
in-line with the spring cartridge to prevent inadvertent stick motion when the<br>
predicted torque drops below the limit torque and the stepper motor is ready to return<br>
to a free-wheeling mode. Furthermore, a stick shaker can be attached to the<br>
collective stick to provide an additional tactile cue.<br>
As the pilot operates the collective stick, the existing control linkage drives<br>
one end of the spring cartridge. When the aircraft is being operated within its<br>
envelope limits, the stepper motor shaft is free to move in either direction as dictated<br>
by forces applied to the actuator arm. The forces applied to the actuator arm are<br>
those transmitted by the spring cartridge and are due to the motion of the collective.<br>
During such time, the actual and predicted values of torque are below the torque<br>
limit. However, if the maximum of either the predicted or actual torque exceeds the<br>
limit, the software directs these activities.<br>
First, an engage flag for the stepper motor is set true, making the stepper<br>
motor act like a magnetic brake. Thus, if the pilot continues pulling up on the<br>
collective, the microswitch shows its true state indicating that the spring cartridge is<br>
in tension. The spring cartridge then supplies a resistive force consisting of a<br>
breakout force and an increasing force proportional to the amount of exceedance.<br>
Once the pilot pushes down on the collective releasing the spring tension, the<br>
microswitch changes to its false state causing the stepper motor to revert to free-<br>
wheeling mode, thereby removing any resistance to corrective action. When the<br>
engage flag changes to true, the current location of the collective is recorded and<br>
serves as an initial value for both the actual location and the commanded location of<br>
the collective stick.<br>
Second, a collective limit position (CLIP) is calculated. This calculation<br>
determines where the collective should be so that the torque will just equal the limit<br>
at the future time, referred to as the prediction horizon. The CLIP is measured<br>
relative to the current location of the collective position, so only a change or delta<br>
needs to be calculated. The calculation itself comes from the amount the torque<br>
exceeds the limit multiplied by the gain relating inches of collective stick to change in<br>
torque. The CLIP is then added to the commanded location for the collective step.<br>
Third, a step command is issued to the stepper motor. If the commanded<br>
location is below the actual location, a "down" step is issued. If the commanded<br>
location is above the actual location, an "up" step is issued. Coincident commanded<br>
and actual location issues a "zero" step. The stepper motor then moves one end of<br>
the spring cartridge accordingly. If the pilot maintains just the breakout force on the<br>
collective, the stepper motor actually drives the pilot's hand to track exactly the<br>
torque limit. If the pilot maintains the collective in one position, he feels the force<br>
modulate according to the degree of exceedance.<br>
Fourth, if the exceedance is greater than a selected additional increment<br>
above the limit, the stick shaker is activated.<br>
These four evaluations are repeated every computational frame. The exact<br>
logic for stepper motor engagement and direction involves a truth table that uses<br>
values of torque exceedance, current and previous stepper motor engagement, and<br>
state of the microswitch.<br>
An important aspect of the present invention is the fact that the corrective<br>
action by the pilot for torque exceedance, rotor droop, and exhaust gas temperature<br>
is to push the collective down. In order to cue against a limit exceedance on all of<br>
these parameters, the system need only determine if any exceedance exists<br>
individually. If so, the system starts the cueing process, then calculates the CLIP for<br>
each parameter that is exceeding its limit, and uses the most conservative answer.<br>
Finally, the limits are not constants, but are instead functions of airspeed and<br>
other parameters. For instance, the torque limit changes in step fashion at a certain<br>
speed, for example Vq. In order to prevent a sudden change in cueing force due to a<br>
sudden change in limit value, the limit value is slowly changed as a function of<br>
airspeed proximity to Vq, and the rate at which the airspeed approaches Vq.<br>
The present invention provides many significant benefits and advantages,<br>
including: (1) the use of electro-hydraulic actuators for inducing control force feel is<br>
avoided, resulting in less complexity, more reliability, and lower costs for<br>
maintenance and repair; (2) the tactile cueing stimulates a sense that is not already<br>
saturated, thereby requiring significantly reduced cognitive effort; (3) an algorithm<br>
that continuously updates the limit position of all parameters over which the<br>
collective has significant influence is used; (4) pilot intent is not interfered with, so<br>
that if a pilot wants to pull through the cue, this system will resist, but not stop that<br>
action; (5) the system employs a crisp, unambiguous cue with an optional shaking<br>
cue, as opposed to a shaking cue alone; (6) the crisp tactile cues permit more<br>
accurate tracking of the limit than do shaking cues; (7) inadvertent over-torque<br>
events can be eliminated, while reducing pilot workload; (8) helicopter operational<br>
safety is improved by reducing pilot workload associated with avoiding certain<br>
operational parameter exceedances during demanding maneuvers; (9) more than<br>
one limit can be cued by the collective stick, i.e., rotor speed, engine torque, and<br>
exhaust gas temperature; (10) different limits can be fused into one conservative<br>
limit that is transmitted to the cueing force controller; (11) "leading" feedback, i.e., the<br>
cue the pilot feels is one calculated to prevent a limit exceedance at some future<br>
time, usually about a half second in the future, can be provided; (12) existing flight<br>
control linkages are retained, as the cueing algorithm uses a minimum of system<br>
sensors, and solves the problem of limited bandwidth of the cueing motor; (13) the<br>
system can be applied to other aircraft controls, such as the cyclic and pedals; and<br>
(14) the system is easily retrofitted to a wide range of existing aircraft.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The method and apparatus of the present invention uses tactile feedback to<br>
cue a pilot of impending exceedance of one or more operational parameters of an<br>
aircraft. The present invention enables the pilot to maintain "eyes-out-the-window"<br>
references during high-workload maneuvering tasks. Although the present invention<br>
is described with regard to a helicopter and HUMS parameters, it should be<br>
understood that the present invention is not limited to such applications, but may be<br>
used as an independent system on any rotorcraft or other aircraft, with or without a<br>
HUMS.<br>
As with any helicopter limit cueing system, the cueing required for closed-loop<br>
torque management must be timely and unambiguous. Simply introducing a soft-stop<br>
at the static collective position where an exceedance is first expected to occur is<br>
insufficient due to the false relief cues that may result. For example, if the collective is<br>
lowered to relieve the force cue, the aircraft could still be in an exceedance condition<br>
due to the application of other control inputs. In other situations, the cueing must be<br>
able to adapt to airspeed dependent limits on torque. Additional requirements for<br>
helicopter limit cueing systems flow down from safety, certification, performance, and<br>
cost and weight considerations, as follows: (1) the soft-stop must not have a failure<br>
mode that a pilot cannot overcome with tolerable control forces; (2) the prediction<br>
algorithm must provide a suitable lead-time; (3) discontinuous torque limits must not<br>
cause discontinuous cueing forces; (4) system costs, including the cost of retrofitting<br>
existing aircraft, must be kept to a minimum; and (5) system reliability must be high.<br>
Although the present invention is described below with respect to engine<br>
torque management, it will be appreciated that the method and apparatus of the<br>
present invention may be used to manage other aircraft parameters, such as rotor<br>
speed and engine temperature, or any other aircraft operational parameter that<br>
requires limiting and/or reducing control inputs.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 in the drawings, an aircraft 10 having a tactile cueing<br>
system 11 according to the present invention is illustrated. Although aircraft 10 is<br>
shown as a helicopter, it will be appreciated that aircraft 10 may be a fixed wing<br>
aircraft, a tilt rotor aircraft, or any other rotorcraft, such as a tilt wing aircraft or a tail<br>
sitter aircraft. Aircraft 10 includes a fuselage 12, a drive means 18, and a main rotor<br>
14. Torque imparted to fuselage 12 by main rotor 14 is counter-acted by a tail rotor<br>
assembly 16 mounted on a tail portion 22 of fuselage 12. Main rotor 14 and tail<br>
rotor assembly 16 are powered by drive means 18 under the control of a pilot in a<br>
cockpit 20.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2 in the drawings, the preferred embodiment of tactile<br>
cueing system 11 is illustrated in a simplified schematic. Tactile cueing system 11<br>
includes a force gradient spring cartridge 13 placed in parallel with an existing control<br>
linkage 15. One end of spring cartridge 13 is coupled to existing control linkage 15,<br>
and the other end of spring cartridge 13 is coupled to an actuator arm 17 of an electric<br>
stepper motor 19. Control linkage 15 is coupled to a collective 21 via a mixing lever 23.<br>
A switching means, or microswitch 25, is operably associated with spring cartridge 13,<br>
preferably by being disposed in-line with spring cartridge 13, to prevent inadvertent<br>
motion of collective 21 when the predicted torque drops below the limit torque and<br>
stepper motor 19 is ready to return to a free-wheeling mode. A position transducer 27<br>
is operably associated with control linkage 15 to provide position data for control<br>
linkage 15. In addition, a stick shaker 29 may be optionally attached to collective 21 to<br>
provide an additional tactile cue. As is shown, stepper motor 19, microswitch 25,<br>
position transducer 27, and stick shaker 29 are all coupled to a system computer 31.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 in the drawings, one exemplary configuration of the<br>
simplified representation of tactile cueing system 11 of Figure 2 is illustrated. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, spring cartridge 13, control linkage 15, stepper motor 19, mixing<br>
lever 23, and microswitch 25 are disposed beneath the cabin floor of aircraft 10.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 in the drawings, tactile cueing system 11 is shown in a<br>
more detailed schematic. Figure 4 illustrates the inter-relation of tactile cueing system<br>
11 to other control systems of aircraft 10. Tactile cueing system 11 is controlled by a<br>
collective cueing processor (CCP) 51 that is powered by aircraft 10. If aircraft 10<br>
includes a HUMS, it is preferred that the central processing unit (CPU) from the HUMS<br>
be used to perform the processing functions of CCP 51. This is the configuration<br>
illustrated in Figure 4. In such applications, CCP 51 is preferably based on the HUMS<br>
Processor Module (HPM) available from Smiths Aerospace Electronic Systems. If<br>
aircraft 10 does not include a HUMS, then CCP 51 may comprise a stand alone unit.<br>
In addition, the processing functions of CCP 51 may be performed by a flight control<br>
computer 59, provided aircraft 10 includes such a flight control computer 59, and that<br>
flight control computer 59 has sufficient computing capacity to perform the processing<br>
functions of CCP 51. Of course, it will be appreciated that CCP 51 may also be a stand<br>
alone unit in applications in which aircraft 10 includes a HUMS. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, an additional interface card 55 to drive the high-current cueing devices,<br>
such as stepper motor 19, stick shaker 29, and warning lights 53, is integrated into<br>
tactile cueing system 11.<br>
The HPM is preferably a 603e PowerPC processor based system with serial<br>
and discrete input/output capability. As well as having specialized avionics interface<br>
devices, the HPM is also fitted with four universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter<br>
(UART) serial interfaces 57, over which the HPM receives data from aircraft flight<br>
control computers 59.<br>
Interface card 55 is used to enable CCP 51 to generate discrete output signals<br>
to drive the cueing devices. Interface card 55 inverts the signals to ensure that if power<br>
is removed from CCP 51, stepper motor 19 is allowed to free wheel, stick shaker 29<br>
and the over-torque indicator are disabled, and failure warning indicator 53 is<br>
illuminated.<br>
CCP 51 uses flight data information from a data acquisition system of aircraft<br>
10 to identify the aircraft flight condition and predict the torque level. When the<br>
torque is predicted to exceed the transmission limit, a cue is provided. The cue can<br>
be generated in a number of forms, including collective force cueing, a stick shaker,<br>
voice warning, or visual warning.<br>
As the pilot operates collective 21, control linkage 15 drives one end of spring<br>
cartridge 13. When aircraft 10 is being operated within its envelope limits, the shaft<br>
of stepper motor 19 is free to move in either direction as dictated by forces applied to<br>
actuator arm 17. The forces applied to actuator arm 17 are those transmitted by<br>
spring cartridge 13 and are due to the motion of collective 21. During such time, the<br>
actual and predicted values of engine torque are below the torque limit. However, if<br>
the maximum of either the predicted or actual engine torque exceeds a selected<br>
limit, the system computer 31 directs these activities.<br>
First, an engage flag for stepper motor 19 is set true, making stepper motor<br>
19 act like a magnetic brake. Thus, if the pilot continues pulling up on collective 21,<br>
microswitch 25 shows its true state indicating that spring cartridge 13 is in tension.<br>
Spring cartridge 13 then supplies a resistive force consisting of a breakout force and<br>
an increasing force proportional to the amount of exceedance. Once the pilot<br>
pushes down on collective 21 releasing the spring tension, microswitch 25 changes<br>
to its false state causing stepper motor 19 to revert to free-wheeling mode, thereby<br>
removing any resistance to corrective action. When the engage flag changes to true,<br>
the current location of collective 21 is recorded and serves as an initial value for both<br>
the actual location and the commanded location of collective 21.<br>
Second, a collective limit position (CLIP) is calculated. This calculation<br>
determines where collective 21 should be so that the torque will just equal the limit at<br>
the future time, referred to as the prediction horizon. The CLIP is measured relative<br>
to the current location of the collective position, so only a change or delta needs to<br>
be calculated. The calculation itself comes from the amount the torque exceeds the<br>
limit multiplied by the gain relating inches of collective stick to change in torque. The<br>
CLIP is then added to the commanded location for the collective step.<br>
Third, a step command is issued to stepper motor 19. If the commanded<br>
location is below the actual location, a "down" step is issued. If the commanded<br>
location is above the actual location, an "up" step is issued. Coincident commanded<br>
and actual location issues a "zero" step. Stepper motor 19 then moves one end of<br>
spring cartridge 13 accordingly. If the pilot maintains just the breakout force on<br>
collective 21, stepper motor 19 actually drives the pilot's hand to track exactly the<br>
torque limit. If the pilot maintains collective 21 in one position, he feels the force<br>
modulate according to the degree of exceedance.<br>
Stepper motor 19, coupled with the spring cartridge 13, applies the required<br>
cueing force. In normal operations, below the torque limit, stepper motor 19 is<br>
designed to free wheel and spring cartridge 13 does not apply force to collective 21. If<br>
a torque exceedance is predicted, stepper motor 19 is engaged and an immediate<br>
collective force cue is transmitted to the pilot. The force cue preferably consists of an<br>
8-pound breakout force at the torque limit plus a 1.4 pound per inch force gradient.<br>
Because collective position for limit torque will vary with flight condition and maneuver<br>
requirements, the resulting position is a dynamic value that requires constant update.<br>
Fourth, if the exceedance is greater than a selected additional increment<br>
above the limit, stick shaker 29 is activated.<br>
These four evaluations are repeated every computational frame. The exact<br>
logic for stepper motor engagement and direction involves a truth table that uses<br>
values of torque exceedance, current and previous stepper motor engagement, and<br>
state of the microswitch.<br>
As set forth above, an important aspect of the present invention is the fact that<br>
the corrective action by the pilot for torque exceedance, rotor droop, and exhaust<br>
gas temperature is to push collective 21 down. In order to cue against a limit<br>
exceedance on all of these parameters, the system need only determine if any<br>
exceedance exists individually. If so, tactile cueing system 11 starts the cueing<br>
process, then calculates the CLIP for each parameter that is exceeding its limit, and<br>
uses the most conservative answer.<br>
Finally, the limits are not constants, but are instead functions of airspeed and<br>
other parameters. For instance, the torque limit changes in step fashion at a certain<br>
speed, for example Vq. In order to prevent a sudden change in cueing force due to a<br>
sudden change in limit value, the limit value is slowly changed as a function of<br>
airspeed proximity to Vq, and the rate at which the airspeed approaches Vq.<br>
Flight control computers 59 provide flight data to control software residing on<br>
CCP 51, which sends applicable tactile cues to the pilot. The control software uses<br>
current control positions and aircraft flight parameters from flight control computers<br>
59 to perform a neural network based prediction of future mast torque. A prediction<br>
using the collective rate is also possible to compensate for aggressive collective<br>
inputs. CCP 51 controls the engagement and position of stepper motor 19.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, tactile cueing system 11 uses flight data<br>
available from a typical HUMS system to provide the required input for tactile cueing.<br>
A major cost driver for a typical FDR or HUMS installation involves the acquisition of<br>
flight data from the predominately analogue transducers found on civil rotorcraft, and<br>
the processors required to implement HUMS applications. This means that the<br>
addition of tactile cueing system 11 on an aircraft already equipped with HUMS can<br>
be achieved at minimum additional cost.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5 in the drawings, a table of flight data parameters is<br>
illustrated. Three separate polynomial neural networks (PNN) predict the torque<br>
simultaneously. These predictions are compared to the current torque, and a final<br>
weighted average for future torque is produced. The preferred PNNs were<br>
developed using the group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm. A major<br>
feature of the GMDH algorithm is that it produces deterministic algebraic expressions<br>
suitable for meeting software certification requirements. Each PNN uses an<br>
independent set of flight data parameters from aircraft 10. The parameters are<br>
preferably grouped into the following categories: airframe, engine and pilot. The<br>
algorithm package has been written such that a different set of PNNs can be used<br>
depending on the current aircraft flight condition. Two exemplary flight conditions<br>
are: (1) above 40 knots; and (2) below 40 knots.<br>
As set forth above, tactile cueing system 11 comprises a parameter prediction<br>
and a "soft-stop" tactile cue. The parameter prediction uses a computer, associated<br>
software, and sensors of control position, engine parameters, and rotor performance<br>
to predict a future value of certain parameters based upon current values. Any<br>
number of algorithms can be applied to the prediction problem, including, but not<br>
limited to, Kalman filtering, extended Kalman filtering, linear prediction, trending,<br>
multi-variable surface fits of measured data, simple analytical expressions, artificial<br>
neural networks, and fuzzy logic. Some of the sensors measure current values of air<br>
data, such as airspeed and rate of descent. Other sensors measure performance<br>
parameters, such as engine torque, exhaust gas temperature, and rotor speed. Still<br>
other sensors measure pilot inputs through control displacement and rate<br>
information. All of this sensed data is sent to the aircraft's flight control computers to<br>
prepare the data for analysis.<br>
Based on the selected algorithm, the parameter prediction is made of a future<br>
value of the desired performance parameters. This predicted value is then passed to a<br>
soft-stop cueing algorithm. The soft-stop algorithm is a "floating ground" algorithm.<br>
This means that a fixed reference point for the position of spring cartridge 13 is not<br>
necessary. By utilizing this floating ground algorithm, additional sensors to detect the<br>
positions of either side of spring cartridge 13 are not necessary. This reduces the cost<br>
of the system and increases reliability by reducing complexity. The use of stepper<br>
motor 19 combines braking capability and precise position control of the floating ground<br>
side of spring cartridge 13 without the requirement of additional sensors.<br>
The cueing algorithm functions as an inverse model. The maximum of the<br>
predicted torque and the measured torque is known as the test torque. The test torque<br>
is compared to the torque limit, which varies with flight condition. If the test torque rises<br>
above the torque limit, the motor engages, establishing the ground for spring cartridge<br>
13. The pilot will feel the breakout force, and an increasing gradient force with<br>
continued upward movement of collective 21. In flight, determination of the test torque<br>
value is an ongoing process, and commands to actuate stepper motor 19 are<br>
continuously computed in order to drive the cue to correspond with the limit collective<br>
position. If the pilot lowers collective 21, decreasing the torque, stepper motor 19 is<br>
disengaged and becomes freewheeling. The inertia of stepper motor 19 is small<br>
enough that no appreciable inertial resistance to collective motion is detected. The<br>
control algorithm also adapts to discontinuous torque limits within the helicopter flight<br>
envelope, using a ramp that is a function of the proximity and rate of approach to the<br>
discontinuity.<br>
Tactile cueing system 11 results in significant advantages in terms of system<br>
airworthiness considerations. During normal operation tactile cueing system 11 is<br>
transparent to the pilot. In the event of an impending torque exceedance, the pilot<br>
can still apply any required collective input by pulling through the breakout and<br>
gradient force. This is a very intuitive reaction. The use of stepper motor 19 makes<br>
the possibility of an actuator hard-over very improbable. In the event of a<br>
mechanical jam the pilot can still fly through spring cartridge 13 without objectionable<br>
collective forces.<br>
It is apparent that an invention with significant advantages has been<br>
described and illustrated. Although the present invention is shown in a limited<br>
number of forms, it is not limited to just these forms, but is amenable to various<br>
changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof.<br>

A method and apparatus for tactile cueing of aircraft controls (21) is disclosed The apparatus of the present invention<br>
 warns pilots of approaching limits on certain aircraft performance parameters. The most common Warnings are for rotor speed<br>
 exceeding a moving limit. The present invention uses tactile cueing through the collective stick (21). Tactile cueing means that<br>
 the pilot does not need to scan the intruments to ascertain proximity to the aforementioned limits. Instead, the pilot can operate the<br>
aircraft within proper limits by touch, while maintaining situational awareness outside of the cockpit (20). The method and apparatus<br>
 of the present invention provides customary friction resistance up to a limit position that is continuously updated. According to the<br>
present invention, continued motion of the collective (21) in a direction beyond that limit position results in a breakout force and an<br>
increasing resistive force.<br></td>
