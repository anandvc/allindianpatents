The following specification   particularly describes  the invention   and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates generally to a space bar saddle, particularly to a screw less space bar saddle. More particularly, the present invention relates to a screw less space bar saddle having unique slide and lock technique of holding the base and the top of the space saddle together without any other fastening means.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Space bar saddles are traditionally used for fixing the elongated members like PVC pipeline on wall or ceiling and to prevent them from falling or sliding hence keeping it fixed at the same position without letting it to loose grip.<br>
Traditional space bar saddle with screws is currently in use for fitting PVC pipes on wall and ceiling. This space bar saddle has many limitations and disadvantages to itself.<br>
Limitations of traditional space bar saddle:<br>
In traditional space bar saddle its very tiring to fix the screws every now and<br>
then.<br>
Some times while tightening the screws of saddle the material breaks and a<br>
saddle with base or top becomes useless, resulting in total wastage of the<br>
product.<br>
Once the saddle is mounted, its become very difficult to mount it the next time, as<br>
the sizes of the holes provided for the screws changes resulting in loose screw fitting.<br>
Hence preventing it from been used for the second time.<br>
2<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to obviate the above-mentioned<br>
drawbacks in the prior art.<br>
It is an important object of the invention to provide a screw less space bar<br>
saddle.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a better space bar saddle which is<br>
easier to use ,fix and mount without the usage of screws.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to avoid the use of screw drivers during<br>
dismantling of the saddle for maintenance purpose.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a screwless space bar saddle<br>
which comes with a unique 4 way locking system that locks the top and base<br>
of the saddle without the help of any other fastening means. This unique<br>
locking system prevents the top and base to get misplaced amongst<br>
themselves to move either way or even slide down when fixed vertically.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
In order to achieve the above objectives and others, the present invention provides a screw less space bar saddle comprising: -<br>
a top part comprising a curved portion with an "u" shaped cross section defining a space for the elongated object to pass through it and having two outwardly stretching flat portion at both ends and perpendicular to the limbs, two mutually perpendicular ridges emerging from the lower edge of each of the said flat portions,<br>
3 <br>
the ridge parallel to the limb thus forming a groove,<br>
a base part comprising a flat rectangular portion having side walls at its small<br>
sides,<br>
said walls having grooves extending from one side to the other<br>
complementary to the flat portion and the mutually perpendicular ridges of<br>
the top part,<br>
thus making the top part slidably fixable with the base part and forming<br>
atleast three locks to prevent from slipping or falling of the top part from the<br>
bottom. At least one hole on the base for fixing the base with the ceiling or<br>
wall with screw.<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Fig.1 shows the saddle space bar of the prior art with screws. Referring to Figs. 2 through 15, there is shown the screw less space bar saddle of the present invention ,the locks developed between the top part and the bottom part and the method of using the invention in different position.<br>
The present invention provides a screw less space bar saddle 1 comprising:<br>
a top part 2 comprising a curved portion with an "u" shaped cross section<br>
defining a space for the elongated object to pass through it and having two<br>
outwardly stretching flat portion 3 at both ends and perpendicular to the<br>
limbs,<br>
two mutually perpendicular ridges 4,5 emerging from the lower edge of each<br>
of the said flat portions 3,<br>
5<br><br>
the ridge parallel to the limb 5 thus forming a groove in conjunction with the<br>
limb,<br>
a base part 6 comprising a flat rectangular portion 7 having side walls 6 at its<br>
small sides,<br>
said walls having grooves 8 ,9,10 extending from one side to the other<br>
complementary to the flat portion and the mutually perpendicular ridges of<br>
the top part, thus making the top part slidably fixable with the base part and<br>
forming at least three locks to prevent from slipping or falling of the top part<br>
from the bottom. At least one hole 11 on the base for fixing the base with the<br>
ceiling or wall with screw.<br>
In another embodiment the grooves in said walls of the base extends from one side to the substantially nearer to the end of other side, thus forming another lock 'D' to prevent top portion from slipping or falling in the direction of insertion.<br>
LOCKS:<br>
There are total 4 locks designed especially to prevent any kind of slipping or falling of the top from the base. These locks are technically designed. These locks are named Lock A, B &amp; C visible on front side of the top and A1, B1 &amp; C1 on the front side of the base. The technique is explained in the fig.4.<br>
The fourth lock is designed on the base of the product. This lock is named Lock 'D'. This lock stops the top to slide downward further in the direction of insertion when the product is fixed in vertical position. These locks (front view) are as illustrated in fig.5.<br>
6<br><br>
Locks TV &amp;'A1'<br>
When the product is fixed upside down on the ceiling, the primary locks that<br>
comes into act are 'A' &amp; 'AT which are designed to prevent the top from<br>
falling down. The lock A1 acts as stopper when the top is fixed on the base in<br>
upside down position on the ceiling as shown in fig. 10. This lock has been<br>
specially designed keeping in mind the ceiling fixture of the product.<br>
The secondary locks that comes into act are lock 'B', 'B1\ 'C &amp; 'C1'. These<br>
locks are designed in such a manner that they prevent the top to slide either<br>
way horizontally or vertically when it is fixed on the ceiling.<br>
Method of using the screw less space bar saddle:<br>
Usage of Lock 'A' and 'A1' (Refer fig. 11)<br>
Step 1: Mount the base on the ceiling<br>
Step 2: Hold the top in line with the base<br>
Step 3: Slide the top inside the base, which is mounted on the ceiling<br>
Step 4: As the top slides inside the base, the top gets fixed firmly to the base<br>
Lock 'B', 'Br, 'C' &amp; 'Cr:<br>
Referring to the figure .12<br>
The other locks are 'B', 'B1\ 'C &amp; 'C1' respectively. The primary reason of<br>
these locks is to prevent the top from sliding either way. Lock 'B' &amp; 'C in<br>
connection with lock 'Bl' &amp; 'CI' prevents the top from sliding out or getting in<br>
any awkward adjustment. These locks come into play when the product is<br>
fixed in horizontal fixture on the side wall.<br>
Usage of Lock 'B'. 'Bl'. 'C &amp; 'C1': (Refer fig. 13)<br>
7<br><br>
Step 1: Mount the base on the ceiling<br>
Step 2: Hold the top in line with the base<br>
Step 3: Slide the top inside the base, which is mounted on the ceiling<br>
Step 4: As the top slides inside the base, the top gets fixed firmly to the base<br>
Lock'D':<br>
There is another lock named as 'D' visible on the back side of base specially<br>
designed for vertical fixture of the product on the side wall, which prevents<br>
any kind of sliding of top when the product is fixed vertically, horizontally or<br>
on ceiling.<br>
Usage of Lock'D’: (Refer fig. 15)<br>
Step 1: Mount the base on the ceiling<br>
Step 2: Hold the top in line with the base<br>
Step 3: Slide the top inside the base, which is mounted on the ceiling<br>
Step 4: As the top slides inside the base, the top gets fixed firmly to the base<br>
Advantages of screwless space bar saddle<br>
Extremely user friendly and easy to fix as there are no screws involved.<br>
No need to mount screws on the top to keep it fixed with the base thus<br>
saving time and energy.<br>
Top and base of the product can be fixed with just sliding .thus resulting in no<br>
wastage or breakage of material while mounting as there is no usage of<br>
screws to fix the top and base.<br>
4 way locking system that uniquely hold the top and base together<br>
irrespective of any angle in which the product is fixed.<br>
8<br><br>
