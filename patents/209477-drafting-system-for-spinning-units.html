3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
221/MUMNP/05<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be  performed :-<br><br>
The invention relates to a drafting system for spinning units .-<br>
with at least one upper roller support and weighting arm, wherein clearer rollers are adjustably supported transversely to their axle in a mounting element on the upper roller support and weighting arm such that they lie during the spinning process against a respectively associated upper roller, and wherein two upper rollers are each supported on a common axle, and the axle is detachably secured to a mounting element on the underside of the upper roller support and weighting arm, characterized in that the upper rollers and the associated clearer rollers are supported by the same mounting element, so that after releasing a locking engagement of the mounting element on the upper roller support and weighting arm, it is possible to displace the upper rollers and the clearer rollers jointly along the upper roller support and weighting arm without additional adjustment of the upper rollers and clearer rollers relative to one another.<br>
The fiber material being spun is normally fed to the spinning units in the form of rovings or feed yarns, which advance through a drafting system upstream of the spinning unit. During the spinning operation, waste fibers may wrap in an undesired manner about the rollers or cylinders of the drafting systems, if fiber material adhering to a drafting roller separates again and enters the path of the advancing roving, which is also named yarn track, undesired knots or thick places may result in the roving and subsequently lead to intolerable imperfections in the yarn. It is therefore common to remove again waste fibers from the drafting rollers by means of clearer rollers. The clearer rollers are rotated by frictional engagement with the operating rollers of the drafting system, and provided with a covering.<br>
DE 44 29 671 CI discloses an upper roller support arm with an alternative design of a mounting sup port for the upper rollers. The upper rollers are supported in so-called steering members, which are mounted for longitudinal displacement and locking engagement in the upper roller support arm.   The weighting   of    the    upper      rollers   occurs    by   means of   a<br><br>
tabular pressure element, which receives compressed air from a source of compressed air.  All steering members can be biased via pressure plates with a weighting pressure.  The disclosed mounting support is used exclusively lor supporting the upper rollers.<br>
The generic art in HP' 0 34 4 944 Al discloses a drafting system, in which the upper ro.l ler support and weighting arm comprises a plurality of upper rollers with associated clearer rollers.  In the operating position, the upper rollers are moved toward the lower rollers and weighted down.  I'n this connection, they form wiLh the lower rollers nip lines. The upper roller support and weighting arm mounts on each side clearer rollers, which each extend over only one yarn track.  Upper rollers and clearer rollers are each provided with separate mounting supports. The upper .rollers are mounted on holding arms, which are supported in the interior of the U-shaped, downwardly open upper roller support and weighting arm for pivoting about horizontal axles. A pivotal support of this type requires a large space in the upper roller support and weiqhting arm.  The installation of pneumatic pressure elements in the upper roller support, and weighting arm, which permit we.igh.tinq and relieving the upper rollers both in a uniform and simple manner, is not possible or possible only to a limited extent. The axles of the clearer rollers are inserted into a mounting support, which is secured to the top of the upper roller support and weighting arm for displacement In the longitudinal direction thereof.  The described mounting support of the upper rollers and clearer rollers requires a relatively large space.<br>
For textile technological reasons, it may be necessary to make an adaptation to the staple length of<br><br>
the fiber material, and to change to this end the distance between the nip lines formed by the paired rollers of the<br>
drafting system. This distance is also named nip spacing. Such a position change requires not only a manual<br>
adjustment or readjustment of the upper and lower rollers of the drafting system but also of all clearer rollers that<br>
interact with these readjusted rollers. The total labor requirements can be extensive in the case of the plurality of<br>
the spinning positions of a spinning machine that is equipped with conventional drafting systems, and lead to<br>
noticeable shutdown times of the spinning units. Based on the above-described state of the art, it is an object of<br>
the invention to improve the mounting support for upper rollers and clearer rollers in drafting systems of spinning<br>
machines. This object is accomplished with a drafting system comprising ... ' .- ,....- •<br>
.'■■_.-'	at least one upper roller support and weighting arm, wherein clearer rollers are adjustably<br>
supported transversely to their axle in a mounting element on the upper roller support and weighting arm such that they lie during the spinning process against a respectively associated upper roller, and wherein two upper rollers are each supported on a common axle, and the axle is detachably secured to a mounting element on the underside of the upper roller support and weighting arm, characterized in that the upper rollers and the associated clearer rollers are supported by the same mounting element, so that after releasing a locking engagement of the mounting element on the upper roller support and weighting arm, it is possible to displace the upper rollers and the clearer rollers jointly along the upper roller support and weighting arm without additional adjustment of the upper rollers and clearer rollers relative to one another. Drafting system, wherein the mounting element comprises lateral parts which engage the upper roller support and weighting arm from the underside on both sides. Drafting system, wherein the mounting element comprises a slotted guideway, and one end of an axle of the clearer rollers forms a retaining device comprising at least one collar, which engages behind the slotted guideway. Drafting system, wherein the upper roller support and weighting arm and the mounting element are constructed such that they form an electrically conductive connection between the upper roller and a machine frame. Drafting system, wherein the mounting element comprises a base body and a steering member for receiving an axle of the upper rollers, said base body is made up of sheet steel and the steering member is made up of an elastic material. Drafting system, wherein the upper roller support and weighting arm comprises on its underside guide flanges and that the base body includes guide slots, said guide flanges engaging the guide slots, so that a secure mounting support exists also when the locking engagement of the mounting element is released, and that the displacement of the mounting element is simplified. Drafting system<br>
 -, wherein the lateral parts each comprise a recess formed as a slotted guideway for guiding the axle of the upper rollers.<br>
The configuration of the mounting element in accordance with the invention provides a common mounting support for upper rollers and clearer rollers, which is stable and excellently suited for a cost-favorable series manufacture. The number of the components to be manufactured and assembled tor the mounting support is reduced. In the case of a common mount of respectively interacting upper rollers and clearer rollers of the drafting system, only one adjustment step will be needed for changing the nip spacing. The clearer roller associated to the upper roller will move along, when it becomes necessary to change the distances  between nips  for a new spinning process by displacing the upper rollers. An additional<br><br>
adjustment of the position of the clearer rollers is not needed for adapting them to the new position o£ the upper rollers.  It is thus possible to reduce the manual labor that is required for changing the distances between nips and the therewith, connected shutdown time.<br>
When the mounting element comprises lateral<br>
m<br>
parts, which engage the upper roller support and weighting arm from the bottom on both sides, the upper side of the upper roller support and weighting arm remains free from components for mounting the clearer rollers.  It is easily possible to provide there functional elements such as, for example, an operating lover.  The clearer rollers are easy to insert into the lateral parts.  The mounting element requires little space.  There remains adequate space in the interior of the upper roller support and weighting arm, for example, for tubular pressure elements, which are used to weight down the upper rollers.<br>
In an advantageous form of realization, one end of the clearer roller axle is constructed as a retaining device that comprises a collar.  The retaining device engages behind a slotted guideway of the mounting element.  Such a configuration permits arranging on each side of tho upper roller support and weighting arm a clearer roller, whose axle is unilaterally supported. With that, it becomes possible to change a nip spacing on each individual upper roller support and weighting arm independently of adjacent upper roller support and weighting arms.  In the case of such a configuration, it is not necessary to adapt the adjustment of facing bearings on respectively facing sides of adjacent upper roller support and weighting arms.<br><br>
An electrically conductive connection between the upper roller and the machine frame prevents the upper roller from being electrostatically charged. Such an electrostatic charge may lead to operational malfunctions and yarn imperfections.<br>
The mounting element of the invention offers the possibility of selecting its manufacture from sheet steel. A mounting element of sheet steel can be manufactured fast and in a cost-favorable manner by manufacturing steps such as cutting and bending, and it excellently withstands the stresses that are to be applied as a functional requirement. The mounting element when made from sheet steel has a relatively low weight and occupies little space.<br>
Guide flanges and guide slots make it possible to slide the mounting element with ease and continuously in the longitudinal direction of the upper roller support and weighting arm for the purposes of adjusting the rollers.<br>
When the axle of the upper rollers is held only by the elastic receptacle of the steering member, the upper roller may assume an undesired tilt. The tilt may reach an extent that adversely affects operation. If the lateral parts of the mounting element comprise a slotted guideway, which forms in addition to the mount by the steering member element, a guidance for the axle of the upper roller, it will be possible to prevent such a tilt from occurring. The mounting element permits constructing a steering member that mounts the axle of the upper rollers such that it  has   onlv a relatively small width and consists in a cost-favorable manner of<br><br>
an elastic plastic, without having to accept the above-described disadvantages.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail with reference to the Figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a simplified, perspective view of an upper roller support and. weighting arm with an embodiment of a mounting element as well as upper rollers and clearer rollers;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of a base body of the mounting element of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is a simplified, perspective view of the upper roller support and weighting arm of Figure 1 with one clearer roller removed; and<br>
Figure 4 is a simplified, perspective view of the upper roller support and weighting arm with the upper rollers and clearer rollers being partially sectioned.<br>
An upper roller support and weighting arm 1 is supported for pivoting about an axis 2 to an upper end position and a lower spinning operation position. A mounting support of this type for an upper roller support arm is disclosed, for example, in DE 44 29 671 CI. The upper roller support and weighting arm 1 is essentially U-shaped and open on its underside. Arranged on each side of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 are an upper roller 3, 4 and a clearer roller 5, 6.  In the spinning operation position of the upper roller support and weighting arm X,   the upper rollers 3, 4 are pressed against lower rollers not shown, as are disclosed, for example, in EP 0 344 944 Al.<br>
Both the upper rollers 3, 4, which are mounted on an axle 37, and the clearer rollers 5, 6 are held in a common mounting element 7.  The mounting<br><br>
element 7 is adjustable in the longitudinal direction of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1, after releasing a locking device not shown, which can be operative in a force-locking or form-fitting manner.<br>
With that, it is possible to adjust the position of the mounting element 7, when resetting the nip spacing. Additional upper rollers with associated clearer rollers may be arranged on the upper roller support and weighting arm in a simple manner by arranging on the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 and securing thereto additional mounting elements.<br>
Figure 2 is a separate and enlarged view of a base body 27 of the mounting element 7 shown in Figure 1. The base body 27 of the mounting element 7 is made symmetric and consists of steel. Its configuration is advantageously obtained by cutting blanks from sheet steel by means of punching or laser machining operations and by subsequent bending or edge turning operations, which suitably proceed in several steps.<br>
Two lateral parts 8, 9 form with an intermediate guide member 10 the U-shaped base body 27 of the mounting element 7, which laterally engages the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 from the bottom in the illustration of Figure 1. The mounting element 7 is slipped over the free end of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1, with guide flanges 11, 12 engaging guide slots 13, 14, 15 and providing on the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 a safe engagement and stable guidance of the mounting element 7. The lateral parts 8, 9 include slotted guideways 16, 17, which each comprise parallel extending guide flanges 18,19, 20, 21 for the clearer rollers. In the illustration of Figure 2, the mounting   element   7  occupies a position, in which the slotted guideways 16,<br><br>
17 extend with their guide flanges 18, 19, 20, 21 .in the vertical direction.  This position corresponds to an  inclination ol the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 by 45°, which is indicated by line 24. In  this position, an-axle 25 of the clearer roller 6 is able to slide easily up and down with a slight play.<br>
Unlike the illustration of Figure 1, in the illustration of Figure 3, the clearer roller 5 has been removed from its hollow bearing pin for providing an unobstructed view o£ the bearing.  In Lhe installed position of the clearer roller 5 on the hollow bearing pin, the clearer roller 5 is detachably secured Lo the hollow bearing pin by means of a stop nipple 26.. The stop nipple 26 interacts with a stop groove arranged in Lhe interior of the clearer roller 5, as is.disclosed, for example, in 1)E 195 21 265 Al.<br>
The axle 25 of the clearer roller 5 is inserted into the slotted guideway 16 of the mounting element 7.  Figure 3 illustrates Lhe position, which the clearer roller 6 assumes, when it lies under its own weight aga.inst the upper roller 3 during the spinning operation. When the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 is pivoted to its upper end position, and, in so doing, raises the clearer rollers 5, 6 from the upper rollers 3, 4, the clearer rollers 5, 6 are no longer supported by the upper rollers 3, 4, and the axles of the clearer rollers 5, 6 slide in the slotted guideways 16, 17 downward, until they come to lie against support lodges 22, 23.  The axle 25 is constructed as a hollow bearing pin. At its end inserted into the slotted guideway 16 of the mounting element 7, the hollow bearing pin comprises a collar 29, which engages behind the lateral part 8 and causes the clearer roller 5 to be unilaterally retained in the<br><br>
mounting element 7 during the spinning operation. The base body 27 of the mounting element 7 includes on each side a recess 28 and 30 as shown in Fig 2 respectively, which are constructed as slotted guideways, and serve to guide the axle 37 of the upper rollers 3, 4. The guidance by the recesses 28, 30 as shown in fig 2 becomes operative upon insertion of the axle 37 into the mounting element 7.<br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 in the direction of its free end. The sectional plane extends through the axes of rotation of the upper rollers 3,4 and clearer rollers 31,32. Unlike the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 3, Figure 4 illustrates alternative embodiments of the mounting element and the clearer rollers. Slipped onto the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 is a mounting element 7 A, which comprises a base body 27A and a steering member 36. In this embodiment, the guide flanges 11, 12 of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 engage guide slots of a guide member 10A of mounting element 7A. Inserted into both sides of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1 are clearer rollers 31,32. With the end of their axles 33, 34, the clearer rollers 31, 32 are able to slide up and down in slotted guideways. Since the section in the illustration of Figure 4 extends through the slotted guideways, the Figure shows only the guide flanges 19A and 21A of the slotted guideways, which are each oriented toward the free end of the upper roller support and weighting arm 1. With the other end of their axles 33,34, the clearer rollers 31,32 are inserted into a mounting support not shown for reasons of simplification, which is arranged on each adjacent upper roller support and weighting arm. With      that,     each    clearer    roller      31,    32    extends    over       respectively<br><br>
two yarn tracks.  The clearer rollers 31, 32 lie under their own weight against the upper rollers 3, 4.  To secure the upper rollers 3, 4 to the upper roller support and weighting arm 1, their axle 37 is manually inserLed from the bottom into an elastic receptacle 35 of the steering member 36,  In a likewise simple manner, the axle 37 can again be removed from the receptacle 35. The steerinq member 36 consists of plastic and includes a pressure plate 38 at its upper end.  The pressure plate 38 is biased by a pressure load from a tubular pressure member 39, i n that the latter receives in a customary manner compressed air from a source of compressed air that is not shown for the sake o£ simplicity. The steering member 36 of the mounting element 7A is adapted for vertical upward and downward movement, so that the weight is transmitted to the upper rollers 3, 4.  In this manner, the upper rollers 3, 4 are pressed against lower rollers in their position during the spinning operation.  A spinning operation position, in which the upper rollers are arranged in a mounting support and pressed against the lower rollers, is disclosed, for example, in WP 0 344 944 Al.  The base body 27A of the mounting element 7A comprises lateral parts 8A, 9A, of which a sectional view is shown in figure 4.  These lateral parts 8A, 9A comprise recesses 28A, 30A, whose width is adapted to the corresponding diameter of the axle 37 of upper rollers 3, 4, and in which the axle 37 extends sideways. The recesses 28A, 30A of the base body 27A are constructed as slotted guideways in the same way as the recesses 28, 30 of the base body 27. This guideway prevents a disadvantageous tilt of the upper rollers 3, 4 relative to the drafting direction.  Such a tilt can<br><br>
occur, when the axle 37 is guided only by the elastic receptacle 35 of the steering member 36.<br>
The invention is not limited to the described embodiments.  Clearer rollers as are disclosed, for example, in DE 195 21 265 Al, may be supported with their pivot arm not directly on the upper roller support and weighting arm as disclosed in DK 195 21 265 Al, but on an adjustable, common mounting element for the respectively associated upper rollers and clearer rollers, and thus represent an alternative embodiment within the scope of the invention<br><br>
