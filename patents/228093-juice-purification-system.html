This International Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent Application No. 60/403,594, hereby incorporated bv reference herein.<br>
I.	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process system for the production of sugar along with other products from sucrose containing juice obtained from plant material, such as, sugar cane, sugar beets, or sweet sorghum. The invention further relates to apparatus and methods to produce sucrose containing juice having a reduced amount of dissolved material. The invention further relates to the conversion of conventional sugar process systems to produce or to utilize such sucrose containing juices that have a reduce amount of dissolved materials.<br>
II. BACKGROUND<br>
Sucrose, C12H22O11, a disaccharide, is a condensation molecule that links one glucose monosaccharide and one fructose monosaccharide. Sucrose occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables of the plant kingdom, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, sweet sorghum, sugar palms, or sugar maples. The amount of sucrose produced by plants can be dependent on the genetic strain, soil or fertilization factors, weather conditions during growth, incidence of plant disease, degree of maturity or the treatment between harvesting and processing, among many factors.<br>
Sucrose may be concentrated in certain portions of the plant, for example, the stalks of the sugarcane plant or the sugar beet root. The entire plant, or a portion of the plant in which the sucrose is concentrated, may be harvested and the plant juices may be removed or extracted to obtain a juice containing a certain concentration of sucrose. Typically, the removal or extraction of juices from plant material involves milling, diffusion, pressing, or a combination thereof. Milling is one of the conventional methods for extracting juice from sugar cane stalks. The sugar cane stalks may be cut up into pieces having the desired size and then passed through rollers to squeeze out the juices.<br><br>
This process may be repeated several times down a series of mills to ensure that substantially all the sugar cane juice is removed.<br>
Diffusion is considered to be the conventional method for extracting juice from the root of the sugar beet. Sugar beets may be sliced into thin strips called "cossettes" that may then be introduced into one end of a diffuser while a diffusion liquid, such as warm water, enters the other. When such counter current processing is used about 98 percent of the sucrose from the cossette or sugar beet material can be removed. The resulting sucrose containing liquid is often called "diffusion juice." The cossettes or beet slices from the diffuser can still be very wet and the juice, which can be 88-92% water, associated with them can still hold some sucrose. The cossettes or beet slices may, therefore, be pressed in a screw press, or other type of press, to squeeze as much juice out of them as possible. This juice often referred to as "pulp press water" can have a pH value of about 5 and in some cases is returned to the diffuser. The resulting pulp may contain about 75% moisture. The addition to the press feed of canonic charged pressing aids can lower the pulp moisture content by about 1.5 to 2%. Sucrose from sugarcane stalks can also be removed by diffusion. One diffusion process for sugarcane involves a moving bed of fmely prepared sugarcane pieces passed through the diffuser allowing the sucrose to be leached out of the sugarcane.<br>
The diffusion process, the milling process, other processes that remove juice from plant material, or bring plant juice into aqueous solution, result in a juice containing sucrose, non-sucrose substances, and water. The nature and amount of the non-sucrose substances in the juice obtained by these processes can vary and may include all manner of plant derived substances and non-plant derived substances, including but not limited to: insoluble material, such as, plant fiber or soil particles; and soluble materials, such as, fertilizer, sucrose, saccharides other than sucrose, organic and inorganic non-sugars, organic acids, dissolved gases, proteins, inorganic acids, organic acids, phosphates, metal ions (for example, iron, aluminum, or magnesium ions), pectins, colored materials, saponins, waxes, fats, or gums, their associated or linked moieties, or derivatives thereof.<br>
These non-sucrose substances are often highly colorized, thermally unstable, or otherwise interfere with certain processing steps or adversely impact the quality or quantity of the sugar product resulting from the purification process. It has been estimated<br><br>
that on average one pound of non-sucrose substances reduces the quantity of sugar product resulting from the purification process by one and one-half pounds. It may be desirable to have all or a portion of these non-sucrose substances separated from or removed from the juice resulting from the diffusion, milling, or other methods used to remove juice from the plant material. A good diffusion operation can eliminate 25-30% of entering impurities. Returned pulp or carbonation press water can reduce this level to 17-20%, however it is still economical due to: heat recovery, make up water saved, wastewater pollution reduced, sugar recovered.<br>
Conventional process systems utilize the remaining plant material, or the juice(s) resulting from the diffusion, milling, or other methods used to remove juice from the plant material, such as those described by United States Patent Nos. 6,051,075; 5,928,42; 5,480,490, each hereby incorporated by reference, or such as those described by "Sugar Technology, Beet and Cane Sugar Manufacture" by P. W. van der Poel et al. (1998); "Beet-Sugar Technology" edited by R.A. McGinnis, Third Edition (1982); or Cane Sugar Handbook: A Manual for Cane Sugar Manufacturers and Their Chemists by James C. P. Chen, Chung Chi Chou, 12th Edition (1993), each hereby incorporated by reference herein, to generate various types of: process juices; solids prepared from the remaining plant material or separated from such process juices during their clarification, purification or refining; sugar or sucrose containing juices; sugar or sucrose crystallized from such sugar or sucrose containing juices; mother liquors of such crystallization of sugar or sucrose, along with the various combinations, permutations, by products, or derivative products thereof, each having a level of impurities consistent with the process steps described herein or any portion thereof, or actually utilized in their production, or consistent with conventional standards for a type or kind of product including, but not limited to: animal feeds containing plant material from which juice has been removed such as exhausted beet cossettes, pulp, bagasse, or other solids or juices separated from process juices; power generated using plant material from which juice has been removed as a fuel to boil water to generate high pressure steam to drive turbine(s) in order to make electricity, or to' generate low pressure steam for the process system, or to generate low grade heat; syrup ranging from pure sucrose solutions such as those sold to industrial users to treated syrups incorporating flavors and colors, or those incorporating some invert sugar to prevent crystallization of sucrose, for example, golden syrup; molasses obtained by removal of all or any part of the crystallizable sucrose or sugar, or products<br><br>
derived from molasses, one example being treacle; alcohol distilled from molasses; bianco directo or plantation sugars generated by sulfitation using sulfur dioxide (S02) as a bleaching agent; juggeri or gur generated by boiling sucrose or sugar containing juices until essentially dry; juice sugar from melting refined white sugar or from syrup(s) which may be further decolorized; single-crystallization cane sugars often referred to as "unrefined sugar" in the United Kingdom or other parts of Europe, or referred to as "evaporated cane juice" in the North American natural foods industry to describe a free-flowing, single-crystallization cane sugar that is produced with a minimal degree of processing; milled cane; demerara; muscovado; rapedura; panela; turbina; raw sugar which can be 94-98 percent sucrose, the balance being molasses, ash, and other trace elements; refined sugars such as extra fine granulated having a quality based upon "bottlers" quality specified by the National Soft Drink Association being water white and at least 99.9 percent sucrose; specialty white sugars, such as, caster sugar, icing sugar, sugar cubes, or preserving sugar; brown sugars that can be manufactured by spraying and blending white refined sugar with molasses which can be light or dark brown sugar depending on the characteristics of the molasses; or powdered sugar made in various degrees of fineness by pulverizing granulated sugar in a powder mill and which may further contain corn starch or other chemicals to prevent caking. This list is not meant to be limiting with respect to the products generated from conventional sugar process systems, but rather, it is meant to provide a few examples of the enormous variety of sugar process system products that are generated.<br>
As can be understood, conventional process systems, in part, comprise steps that increasingly clarify, purify, or refine juice(s) resulting from the diffusion, milling, or other methods used to remove juice from the plant material. Typically, a portion of the insoluble or suspended material in sucrose containing juice derived from plant material can be removed using one or more mechanical processes such as screening. The resulting screened juice, when derived from sugar beets, for example, may contain about 82%-85% by weight water, about 13-15% by weight sucrose, about 2.0-3.0% by weight dissolved non-sucrose substances or impurities, and some amount of remaining insoluble materials.<br>
Typically, the resulting sucrose containing juice or juices, which can have a volume of 1000-2500 gallons per minute, may be treated by the gradual addition of base to increase the pH of the juice. In certain conventional process systems, the pH of the<br><br>
juice may be raised from between about 5.5 pH to about 6.5pH up to between about 11.5 pH to about 11.8pH to enable certain non-sucrose substances contained in such juices to reach their respective iso-electric points. This step is often referred to as "preliming". However, the subsequent use of this term is not meant to limit the step of adding base to sucrose containing juice or juices solely to those process systems that refer to this addition of base as "preliming". Rather it should be understood that in the various conventional juice process systems it may be desirable to first utilize base to raise pH of juice prior to a subsequent process step, such as a filtration step, as described by United States Patent Nos. 4,432,806, 5,759,283, or the like; an ion exchange step as described in British Patent No. 1,043,102, or United States Patent Nos. 3, 618, 589, 3,785,863, 4,140,541, or 4,331,483, 5,466,294, or the like; a chromatography step as described by United States Patent Nos. 5,466,294, 4,312,678, 2,985,589, 4,182,633, 4,412,866, or 5,102,553, or the like; or an ultrafilitration step as described by United States Patent No. 4,432,806, or the like; phase separation as described by United States Patent No. 6,051,075, or the like; process systems that add active materials to the final carbonation vessel as described by United States Patent No. 4,045,242, that may be an alternative to the conventional juice process steps of main liming and carbonation, each reference hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The use of the term "base" involves the use materials that are capable of increasing the pH of a juice including, but not limited to the use of lime or the underflow from processes that utilize lime. The use of the term "lime" typically involves the specific use of quick lime or calcium oxides formed by heating calcium (generally in the form of limestone) in oxygen to form calcium oxide. Milk of lime is preferred in many juice process systems, and consists of a suspension of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in accordance with the following reaction:<br>
CaO+H2O = Ca(OH)2 +15.5 Cal.<br>
The term "iso-electric point" involves the pH at which dissolved or colloidal materials, such as proteins, within the juice have a zero electrical potential. When such dissolved or colloidal materials reach their designated iso-electric points, they may form a plurality of solid particles, flocculate, or flocs.<br><br>
Flocculation may be further enhanced by the addition of calcium carbonate materials to juice, which functionally form a core or substrate with which the solid particles or flocculates associate. This process increases the size, weight or density of the particles, thereby facilitating the filtration or settling of such solid particles or materials and their removal from the juice.<br>
The resulting mixture of juice, residual lime, excess calcium carbonate, solid particles, flocculants, or flocs, may then be subjected to subsequent process steps as described above. Specifically, with regard to the process system for the clarification, purification, or refining of juices generated by the prior processing of sugar beets, the mixture may first be subjected to a cold main liming step to stabilize the solids formed in the preliming step. The cold main liming step may involve the addition of about another 0.3-0.7% lime by weight of prelimed juice (or more depending on the quality of the prelimed juice) undertaken at a temperature of between about 30 degrees Centigrade to about 40 degrees Centigrade.<br>
The cold main limed juice may then be hot main limed to further degrade invert sugar and other components that are not stable to this step. Hot main liming may involve the further addition of lime to cause the pH of the limed juice to increase to a level of between about 12 pH to aboutl2.5 pH. This results in a portion of the soluble non-sucrose materials that were not affected by preceding addition of base or lime to decompose. In particular, hot main liming of the limed juice may achieve thermostability by partial decomposition of invert sugar, amino acids, amides, and other dissolved non-sucrose materials.<br>
After cold or hot main liming, the main limed juice can be subjected to a first carbonation step in which carbon dioxide gas can be combined with the main limed juice. The carbon dioxide gas reacts with residual lime in the main limed juice to produce calcium carbonate in the form of precipitate. Not only may residual lime be removed by this procedure (typically about 95% by weight of the residual lime), but also the surface-active calcium carbonate precipitate may trap substantial amounts of remaining dissolved non-sucrose substances. Furthermore, the calcium carbonate precipitate may function as a<br><br>
filter aid in the physical removal of solid materials from the main limed and carbonated juice.<br>
The clarified juice product obtained from the first carbonation step may then be subjected to additional liming steps, heating steps, carbonation steps, filtering steps, membrane ultrafiltration steps, chromatography separation steps, or ion exchange steps as above described, or combinations, permutations, or derivations thereof to further clarify or purify the juice obtained from the first carbonation step resulting in a process juice often referred to as "thin juice".<br>
This further clarified juice or "thin juice" may be thickened by evaporation of a portion of the water content to yield a product conventionally referred to as "syrup". Evaporation of a portion of the water content may be performed in a multi-stage evaporator. This technique is used because it is an efficient way of using steam and it can also create another, lower grade, steam which can be used to drive the subsequent crystallization process, if desired.<br>
The thickened clarified juice or "syrup" can be placed into a container, which may typically hold 60 tons or more. In the container, even more water is boiled off until conditions are right for sucrose or sugar crystals to grow. Because it may be difficult to get the sucrose or sugar crystals to grow well, some seed crystals of sucrose or sugar are added to initiate crystal formation. Once the crystals have grown the resulting mixture of crystals and remaining juice can be separated. Conventionally, centrifuges are used to separate the two. The separated sucrose or sugar crystals are then dried to a desired moisture content before being packed, stored, transported, or further refined, or the like. For example, raw sugar may be refined only after shipment to the country where it will be used.<br>
There is a competitive global commercial market for the products derived from sucrose containing plant materials and juices. The market for products produced from sucrose containing plant material has sufficient size that even a slight reduction in the cost of a single process system step can yield a substantial and desired monetary savings. As such, there is great incentive to perform research in sugar or juice process systems by the sugar industry to yield process system savings, by independent researchers and by<br><br>
distributors who may be paid for novel process system chemicals and equipment, and in some cases have a further incentive by additional payments based upon a percentage of the savings within the process when improvements are made.<br>
However, even though process systems for the purification of sucrose containing juices from certain plant materials have been established and improved upon for at least 1000 years, and specifically with regard to sugar beets, there have been commercial process systems for more than 100 years, and even though there is great incentive to generate improvements within sugar or juice process systems, significant problems with regard to the processing of juices obtained from plant material remain.<br>
A significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems can be the expense of obtaining and using base, such as calcium oxide, to raise the pH of the sucrose containing liquids orjuice(s) obtained from plant materials. As discussed above, calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide may be added to juice to raise the pH allowing certain dissolved materials to come out of solution as solids, flocculent, or flocs. Calcium oxide is typically obtained through calcination of limestone a process in which the limestone is heated in a kiln in the presence of oxygen until carbon dioxide is released resulting in calcium oxide.<br>
As shown by Figure 5, calcination can be expensive because it requires the purchase of the kiln (40), limestone (41), and fuel (42), such as gas, oil, coal, coke, or the like, that can be combusted to raise the temperature of the kiln sufficiently to release carbon dioxide (43) from the limestone (41). Ancillary equipment to transport the limestone and the fuel to the kiln and to remove the resulting calcium oxide from the kiln must also be provided along with equipment to scrub certain kiln gases and particles from the kiln air exhausted during calcination of the limestone. Naturally, labor must be provided to operate and maintain the equipment, as well as, monitor the quality of the calcined limestone generated and also to monitor the clean up of gases and particulates released during operation of the kiln.<br>
Additionally, the calcium oxide generated by calcination must be converted to calcium hydroxide for use in typical juice process systems. Again this involves the purchase of equipment to reduce the calcium oxide to suitably sized particles and to mix<br><br>
these particles with water to generate calcium hydroxide. Again, labor must be provided to operate and maintain this equipment.<br>
Finally, the investment in equipment and labor associated with the use of calcium oxides incrementally increases as the amount used increases. This may involve the incremental expenditure for the additional labor to mix additional amounts of calcium hydroxide with juice, or it may involve an incremental expenditure to use equipment having greater loading capacity or having greater power, or the like.<br>
Another significant and related problem with the production of and use of base in conventional process systems can be disposal of excess base or the products formed when the base reacts with organic acids or inorganic acids dissolved in the juice. For example, when the process system uses one or more carbonation steps in clarifying or purifying juice, the amount of calcium carbonate or other salts formed, often referred to as "spent lime", will be proportionate to the amount of lime added to the juice. Simply put, the greater the amount of lime added to the juice, generally the greater the amount of precipitates formed during the carbonation step The "carbonation lime" may be allowed to settle to the bottom of the carbonation vessel forming what is sometimes referred to as a "lime mud". The lime mud can be separated by a rotary vacuum filter or plate and frame press. The product formed is then called "lime cake". The lime cake or lime mud may largely be calcium carbonate precipitate but may also contain sugars, other organic or inorganic matter, or water. These separated precipitates are almost always handled separately from other process system wastes and may, for example, be slurried with water and pumped, to settling ponds or areas surrounded by levees or transported to land fills.<br>
Alternately, the carbonation lime, lime mud, or lime cake can be recalcined. However, the cost of a recalcining kiln and the peripheral equipment to recalcine spent lime can be substantially more expensive than a kiln for calcining limestone. Furthermore, the quality of recalcined "carbonation lime" can be different than calcined limestone. The purity of calcined limestone compared to recalcined carbonation lime may be, as but one example, 92% compared with 77%. As such, the amount of recalcined lime required to neutralize the same amount of hydronium ion in juice may be correspondingly higher. Also, the carbon dioxide content of spent lime can be much higher than limestone. As such, not only can recalcined lime be expensive to generate, it<br><br>
can also require the use of substantially larger gas conduit and equipment to transfer the generated CO2 from recalcining spent lime, larger conveying equipment to move the recalcined lime, larger carbonation tanks, or the like.<br>
Also, whether spent lime is disposed of in ponds, landfills, or by recycling, the greater the amount of lime utilized in a particular process system, generally the greater the expense of disposing the spent lime.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be an incremental decrease in process system throughput corresponding with an incremental increase in the amount of lime used in processing juice(s). One aspect of this problem may be that there is a limit to the amount of or rate at which lime can be produced or provided to juice process steps. As discussed above, limestone must be calcined to produce calcium oxide prior to its use as a base in juice process systems. The amount of lime produced may be limited in by availability of limestone, kiln capacity, fuel availability, or the like. The rate at which lime can be made available to the juice process system may vary based on the size, kind, or amount of the lime generation equipment, available labor, or the like. Another aspect of this problem can be that the amount of lime used in the process system may proportionately reduce volume available for juice in the process system. Increased use of base, such as lime, may also require the use of larger containment areas, conduits, or the like to maintain throughput of the same volume of juice.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be excess acids within plant material generated prior to extraction of the plant juice. Organic acids act as a buffering system in the acid-base equilibrium of the plant cell, in order to maintain the required pH value in the plant tissue. The origin of these acids can be divided into two groups, the first, are acids taken up by the plant from the soil in the course of the growing cycle, and the second, are acids formed by biochemical or microbial processes. When the uptake of acids from the soil is insufficient, plants may synthesize organic acids, primarily oxalic acid, citric acid and malic acid, to maintain a healthy pH value of the plant cell juice. As such, juice extracted from the plant tissue will contain a certain amount of various organic acids.<br><br>
In addition to this naturally occurring amount of organic acids within the plant tissue, acids may be formed during storage primarily by microbial processes. Badly deteriorating plant material may generate large amounts of organic acids, primarily lactic, acetic acid, as well as citric acid. The total acid content within the plant tissue can increase threefold, or more, under certain circumstances.<br>
Moreover, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be generated in the plant tissues due to breakdown of the natural alkalinity in the juice. In this process, bicarbonate ion and carbonate ion are converted to carbon dioxide. The resulting carbon dioxide to the extent it remains in solution generates carbonic acid that provides a source of hydronium ion. Organic acids contained within the plant cell juice, in whole or in part, remain within the juice obtained from the plant material. As such, to raise the pH of the juice, these organic and inorganic acids must be neutralized with base. The higher the concentration of organic acids or inorganic acids within the juice, the greater the amount of base that may be necessary to raise the pH of the juice to a desired value.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be that plant materials or juice(s) treated with antimicrobial chemicals can have higher acid content then untreated plant materials or juices. For example, sulfur dioxide (SO2) or ammonium bisulfite (NH4HSO3) can be added continuously or intermittently to help control microbial growth or infection. The amount of SO2 added depends on the severity of the microbial growth or infection. Lactic acid and nitrite levels can be monitored or tracked to determine severity of growth or infection. Up to about 1000 ppm of SO2 can be used to shock or treat an infected system. Up to 400-500 ppm can be fed continuously to control an infection. The SO2 or NH4HSO3 addition used for antimicrobial protection can lower the pH and alkalinity of juice(s). The alkalinity reduction may occur due to conversion of naturally occurring bicarbonate ions to CO2 and carbonic acid.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be the formation of scale in containment vessels, such as, evaporators or sugar crystallization equipment. The calcium salt of oxalic acid often forms the main component of scale. Oxalate has low solubility in solution and that solubility can be reduced as the amount of calcium in solution increases. Even after juice purification to "thin" or "thick" juices there can be sufficient calcium in solution to force oxalate out of solution. The process of<br><br>
removing scale from the surfaces of equipment can be expensive, including, but not limited to, costs due to production slowdowns and efficiency losses, or the reduction in the effective life of equipment<br>
Another significant problem with convention sugar processing systems may be the lack of recognition that juice extraction equipment or processes used to obtain juice from plant material can alter or reduce the pH of the extracted juice. With respect to diffusors used to extract juice from sugar beet material, there may have been a failure to recognize that the pH value of sugar beet juice can be altered or reduced during the diffusion process. Another aspect of this problem may be that there may be a lack of recognition that different apparatus or different methods used to diffuse juice from sugar beet material alters or reduces the pH of the juice obtained differentially. To the extent that improvements in diffusion technology have generally resulted in increasingly lower pH values of the juice obtained, these apparatuses and methods teach away from the solutions provided by the invention.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be that organic substances, dissolved gases, or other materials soluble in juice (such as CO2 or SO2 as examples) extracted, removed, or diffused from sugar beets or added to the extracted or diffusion juice may not to the extent possible be allowed to move toward equilibrium or to equilibrate with atmospheric partial pressures or a selected mixture of partial pressures of gases prior to pre-liming steps in conventional sugar process purification. As such, dissolved materials that could have been transferred from the extracted, removed, or diffusion juice(s) to the atmosphere or other selected mixture of gases, thereby reducing partial pressures or concentration of those dissolved materials in the diffusion juice, remain to directly contribute to or indirectly contribute by conjunction with other pH adjusting processes in the juice(s), that result in lowering of pH of the diffusion juice(s) prior to or at the time of performing pre-liming, initial liming, lime addition step(s). Lower pH can result in the use of additional lime, as described above, to achieve the desired pH of the juice.<br>
One aspect of this problem with respect to conventional diffusion of sugar beet cossettes (or other conventional methods of removing or extracting juice or material(s) from plant material(s)) may be that convention diffusion equipment (or other convention<br><br>
equipment used to remove or extract juice or other materials from plant material(s)) does not provide, or provides an inadequate, surface interface between the diffusion juice(s) or liquids containing extracted or removed plant material(s) and the atmosphere, or other selected or desired mixture of gases, to allow materials dissolved in the diffusion juice or other liquids that contain extracted or removed plant materials to move toward an equilibrium that would substantially reduce the concentration of such materials in the juice or other liquids containing extracted or removed plant materials.<br>
Another aspect of this problem may be that conventional sugar beet-diffusion methods or equipment (or other convention equipment used to remove or extract juice or other materials from plant material(s)) does not provide sufficient re-circulation of atmospheric partial pressures, or other selected partial pressures of gases, within the equipment to maintain a difference in partial pressures between the concentration of dissolved material in the juice or other liquid containing extracted or removed plant material that can potentially be equilibrated with the partial pressures of gases presented at the gas-liquid interface to be effective in achieving the desired, potential, or possible reduction of pH reducing materials in the diffusion juice or other liquid containing extracted or removed plant material. As such, partial equilibrium or complete equilibrium between the partial pressures of gases presented at the liquid interface and the partial 'pressures of gases in solution prevents or slows the further reduction in concentration of pH reducing materials, compounds, or gases in the diffusion juice.<br>
A third aspect of this problem may be that conventional sugar beet-diffusion methods or equipment (or other convention equipment or methods used to remove or extract juice or other materials from plant materials)) may be that the diffusion juice(s) are not mixed sufficiently to allow the entire volume, or a sufficient volume, of the diffusion juice or other liquid containing extracted or removed plant materials that contribute to the reduction in pH to move toward equilibrium with the atmosphere or other mixture of gases presented at the liquid-gas interface.<br>
A fourth aspect of this problem may be that conventional sugar beet-diffusion methods or equipment (or other convention equipment or methods used to remove or extract juice or other materials from plant material(s)) do not heat the diffusion juice(s) or other liquids containing extracted or removed plant material(s), to a temperature that<br><br>
sufficiently reduces the solubility of the diffusion juice or other liquids containing extracted or removed plant material(s) to allow concentrations of pH reducing materials to move toward, or equilibrate with, the concentration in the partial pressures of gases presented at the liquid-gas interface, or move the point of equilibrium such that the concentration of pH reducing materials can be reduced to the desired, potential, or possible concentration, or move toward or equilibrate with the partial pressure of gases presented to the gas-liquid interface at the rate desired, or at the potential or possible equilibration rate that may be desired or achieved.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be that extracted or diffusion juice(s) are allowed to move toward equilibrium, or equilibrate with, atmospheric partial pressures or other mixture of gases having a higher concentration of pH reducing materials that may be presented to the surface of the juice as it cools. As diffusion juice or other liquids containing extracted or removed plant material cool the solubility of atmospheric gases or other mixture of gases can increase. As such, the concentration of gases or other materials that can be dissolved into the juice (including but not limited to pH reducing materials) may increase as the diffusion juice cools. As but a single example, solubility of atmospheric CO2 increases as diffusion juice cools from a range of between about 55 °C to about 70°C during diffusion steps to a range of temperature between about 20°C to 30°C prior to the pre-liming or liming steps. Exposure to atmospheric partial pressures of CO2, or any mixture of gases having sufficient partial pressure of CO2 to allow transfer of CO2 to the juice as it cools, increases the concentration of CO2 in the diffusion juice relative to that amount present at higher temperatures. The increased concentration of CO2 in the diffusion juice may reduce the pH of me juice. As such, the increased concentration of CO2 or other gases in the diffusion juice may require addition of greater amounts of lime during subsequent lime addition, pre-liming or other liming steps to achieve a desired or necessary pH.<br>
Another significant problem with conventional sugar processing systems may be that the partial pressures of gases presented at the gas-liquid interface of diffusion juice or other liquids containing removed or extracted plant materials to be effective in establishing a concentration gradient sufficient to volatilize, move, remove or otherwise transfer the necessary or desired portion of materials dissolved in the diffusion juice or other liquid containing removed or extracted plant materials to substantially increase the<br><br>
pH of the diffusion juice or reduce the concentration of pH reducing materials in the diffusion juice.<br>
The present invention provides a juice process system involving both apparatuses and methods that address each of the above-mentioned problems.<br>

V. MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Generally, the invention involves a juice process system to purify juice without addition of base or with reduced addition of base prior to evaporation of excess water content or fractional crystallization.of sucrose. Specifically, the invention provides juice having reduced dissolved material, reduced dissolved gases, higher pH, or lower acidity for use in juice process systems.<br>
As discussed above juice can be obtained from plant material such as sugar beets, sugar cane, sweet sorghum, or the like. Naturally, there may be large commercial markets or niche markets for products that necessitate obtaining juice from other types of plant materia] and it should be understood that the invention is not limited to juice removed, extracted, or obtained from any particular type of plant, or any portion of the plant or plant material harvested. Moreover, the term juice can be broadly understood to<br><br>
be any sucrose containing juice or liquid at, or from, any step in any process system prior to sugar crystallization. As such, sucrose containing liquids obtained from plant material by milling or pressing steps, or the juice resulting from the steps of diffusing the plant material, as but two examples, are juice. As further described above, the term juice includes liquid containing sucrose, non-sucrose substances, and water that can occur in various proportions depending on the nature of the plant material and the steps used to remove juice from the plant material. It may be desirable to remove all or a portion of the dissolved materials because they are highly colorized, thermally unstable, or otherwise interfere with certain processing steps or adversely impact the quality or quantity of the sugar product resulting from the purification process. The sucrose containing liquids resulting from these various clarification or purification steps are also included in the term juice.<br>
Particular embodiments of the invention involve the removal of at least a portion of the dissolved materials, volatile materials, dissolved gases, aqueous acids, or the like, such as carbon dioxide or sulfur dioxide that can form aqueous acids mat generate hydronium ion in solution, change the concentration of hydronium ion in the juice, or lower the pH of the juice.<br>
For example, when juice contains sufficient cations, hydroxide ion OH" can act as a anion, which enables carbon dioxide CO2 to dissolve into the juice as carbonate ions (CO3)"2, or as bicarbonate ions HCO3". The dissociation of HCO3' provides a very weak acid. However, when juice contains an insufficient number of cations to allow dissolved CO2 to form carbonate or bicarbonate ions, an equilibrium results between carbon dioxide and carbonic acid H2CO3. Carbonic acid can act as a strong acid in the pH range that juice is obtained. The consequent production of hydronium ion increases the existing concentration in the juice resulting in values of pH that can be lower.<br>
Similarly, sulfur dioxide (SO2) or ammonium bisulfite (NH4HSO3) can be introduced into the juice to control, reduce, or eliminate microbiologic activity, sucrose hydrolysis, formation of invert sugars, or loss of sucrose, or to adjust pH lower. Again, when juice contains sufficient cations, such as calcium, sulphites, such as calcium sulfite can result. However, when juice contains an insufficient number of cations to allow dissolved sulfur dioxide (SO2) to form sulphites, an equilibrium results between sulfur<br><br>
dioxide (S02), sulfurous acid (H2SO3), and sulfuric acid (H2S04). Sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid can act as strong acids. The consequent production of hydronium ion increases the existing concentration in the juice resulting in values of pH that can be lower.<br>
Additionally, other aqueous acids can be generated by the plant during normal growth and other acids are generated by microbial activity including, but not limited to, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, or the like.<br>
Moreover, other dissolved materials, such as ammonia NH3, can be generated by the breakdown of amino acids or by the conversion of materials added to the juice such as ammonium bisulfite.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 1, an embodiment of the invention can comprise exposing juice (1) obtained from plant material (2) to a mixture of gases (3) in a manner that generates an increased interface surface area (4) between the juice (1) and the mixture of gases (3). By generation of the increased interface surface area (4) between the juice (1) and the mixture of gases ( 3), the transfer rate of various types of dissolved materials (5) from the juice (1) to the mixture of gases (3) can be increased as the concentration of each component of the dissolved material (5) moves toward equilibrium with the concentration of that component in the mixture of gases (3). The mixture of gases (or stripping gas) can be selected to provide the desired partial pressures necessary to allow transfer of the undesired dissolved material (5) from the juice (1) to the mixture of gases (3). The mixture of gases (3) can be refreshed, or the partial pressures of the gases adjusted, continuously or periodically, at the increased interface surface area (4) with the juice (1) to prevent equilibrium between the mixture of gases (3) and the dissolved material (5) from occurring, thereby maintaining transfer of dissolved material ( 5) from the juice to the mixture of gases (3).<br>
When the invention is utilized dissolved materials or volatile materials, such as, volatile inorganic compounds, volatile organic compounds, or dissolved gases (e.g. carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or ammonia) can be removed from the juice. The juice<br><br>
product resulting from use of the invention can have reduced dissolved material, reduced dissolved gases, reduced capacity to generate hydronium ion, or a decreased concentration of hydronium ion, lower acidity, or a higher pH as compared to the same juice without application of the invention. As but one example, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the juice can be reduced substantially when atmospheric partial pressures are used to strip the juice. The pH of the juice product resulting from the process can have a pH value that is higher by 0.05 pH, 0.1 pH, 0.2 pH, 0.3 p'H, 0.4 pH, 0.5 pH, 0.6 pH, 0.7 pH, 0.8 pH, 0.9 pH, 1.0 pH, 1.1 pH, 1.2, pH1.3, pH1.4, pH1.5, pH1.6, pH1.7, pH1.8, pH1.9, 2.0 pH, however, any upward adjustment of the pH value from the initial pH value of the untreated juice can result in a substantial monetary savings and can be important commercially. The actual amount of upward adjustment of the pH value from the initial pH value generally depends upon the kind and quality of juice treated by the invention, the extent of the increased interface surface area generated throughout the volume of juice, the duration of time the mixture of gases is responsive to the increased interface surface area generated, and the partial pressures provided in the mixture of gases. As such, the upward adjustment of the pH value can vary with respect to the embodiment of the invention utilized. For example, varying the volume or amount of juice treated per unit time, but otherwise using the same embodiment of the invention, can yield a different increment in change of the pH value.<br>
The invention can further comprise the step of reducing the amount of base added per unit weight or unit volume of the juice treated with the invention to achieve a necessary or desired pH, concentration of hydronium ion, or acidity as compared to untreated juice or conventional process treated juice. The amount of base added after reducing dissolved material in the juice by treatment with the invention can be substantially less to establish a desired pH value, such as, between about 11.0 to about 12.0, or between 11.5 to about 12.5, or the range of pH used to "prelime", "main lime", "intermediate lime, or to establish a pH value corresponding to the iso-electric point of any particular non-sucrose substance in the juice, or required to adjust the acidity or alkalinity of the' juice to a desired concentration. With respect to lime usage, for example, a reduction of up to about 30% can be achieved by using the various embodiments of the invention as compared to untreated juices or conventional process treated juices.<br><br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 2, embodiments of the invention can comprise a mixture of gases (3) that can comprise atmospheric gases , or air, atmospheric gases or air that have been passed through one or more filters to reduce, or to substantially eliminate, non-biological particulate or biological particles (such as bacteria, viruses, pollen, microscopic flora or fauna, or other pathogens); atmospheric gases or air that have been passed through chemical scrubbers or otherwise processed to generate a desired concentration or range of concentrations of partial pressures of gases; purified gases; or combinations or permutations thereof.<br>
Particular embodiments of the invention can further include a gas filter (6) responsive to the flow of the mixture of gases (3). The gas filter (6) can be located before, or can be located after, a gas flow generator (7) made fluidicly responsive to the mixture of gases (3). The gas filter (6) responsive to the flow of the mixture of gases (3) can comprise a Hepa filter, or a Ulpa filter, or other type of macro-particulate or micro-particulate filter. Additional prefilters may also be used to capture particles in the mixture of gases prior to entering the gas flow generator (7), or may be used after the gas flow generator but prior to the gas filter (6).<br>
An unfiltered mixture of gases (3) can be drawn into a first stage prefilter (8) then through the second stage prefilter (9) and then through the gas flow generator (7). The prefiltered mixture of gases can then flow through the gas filter (6) (Hepa filter, or Ulpa filter, or other type filter). The resulting filtered mixture of gases (up to 99.99% of all particles as small as about 0.3 microns removed from the mixture of gases (3) when a Hepa filter is used, and up to 99.99% of all particles as small as about 0.12 microns removed from the mixture of gases ( 3) when a Ulpa filter is used) can then be made to generate or be responsive to the increased interface surface area (4) between the juice (1) and the mixture of gases (3). As to other embodiments of the invention, the mixture of gases (3) or the juice (1) can be exposed to short wavelength ultraviolet radiation source (10) in order to reduce the number of pathogen particles or bacterial particles. The invention can further comprise temperature control means (11) for establishing a desired temperature of the mixture of gases (3) prior to making them responsive with the juice (1) or the increased interface surface area (4). The temperature control means (11) can be made responsive to a temperature sensor (12) that can detect the temperature of the mixture of gases (3) or the juice (1) and can signal or cause the temperature control means<br><br>
(11) to adjust the temperature of the mixture of gases (3) or the juice (1), or both, to a desired temperature.<br>
With respect to certain embodiments of the invention, the mixture of gases (3), whether filter or unfiltered, can be used to form or assist in the formation of the increased interface surface area (4). For example, juice (1) can be transferred to a gas injector (13) by gravity feed or transferred under pressure generated by a pump (14) or other liquid transfer element. The gas injector (13) can have an inlet port (15) through which juice (1) enters the gas injector (13), an outlet port (16) from which juice (1) exits the gas injector (13), and at least one injection port (17) through which the mixture of gases (3) can be delivered into at least a portion of the volume of juice (1) contained within or passed through the gas injector (13).<br>
When the gas injector (13) has a configuration for batch processing of juice (the gas injector is periodically filled and emptied) the inlet port (15) and the outlet port (16) can, with respect to certain embodiments of the invention, be the same port. When the gas injector (13) has a configuration for pulsatile flow processing (the flow of the juice ( 1) can be periodically diminished or interrupted to increase residence time of the juice (1) in or responsive to the gas injector (13)), or continuous flow processing (a stream of juice (1) flows continuously through the gas injector (13) although the rate or volume of juice (1) flowing through the gas injector (13) may be adjusted) the inlet port (15) and the outlet port (16) can be discrete.<br>
As to each embodiment of the invention, the mixture of gases (3) can be injected into the juice (1) with a sufficient volume, at a sufficient pressure, or with a pattern of distribution (e.g. diffused or as small bubbles) to generate the desired increased interface surface area (4) between the juice (1) and the mixture of gases (3). The increased interface surface area (4) can provide the interface at which at least a portion of the dissolved material (5) in the juice can transfer from the juice (1) to the mixture of gases (3).<br>
The gas injector (13) whether configured to operate as a batch, pulsatile, intermittent, or continuous embodiment of the invention, can further agitate, move, stir or otherwise provide mixing means (18) to further distribute the mixture of gases (3) into the<br><br>
juice (1) to further generate the increased interface surface area (4). Where the configuration of the gas injector (13) generates a stream of juice (1), whether continuous, pulsatile, or discontinuous, injecting the mixture of gases (3) into the juice (1) can generate a mixed stream of juice (19). The mixture of gases in the mixed stream of juice (19) may be further distributed in the mixed stream of juice (19) by further extensions, channels, or the like coupled to the interior surface of the gas injector (13). The extensions or channels can be oriented to create a desired perturbation of the stream of juice within the gas injector (13). The invention can further provide a injection pressure adjustment means (20) to which the gas flow generator (7) can be responsive to increase or decrease the pressure or volume of the mixture of gases (3) injected, mixed, or sparged into the juice (1). In some, embodiments of the invention, the injection pressure adjustment means (20) can individually or in combination comprise a variably adjustable restriction means located between the gas flow generator (7) and the injection port (17).<br>
The invention, with respect to certain embodiments, can generate total dissolved gases within the juice greater than the initial concentration in the juice. This can be up to about 10 times the concentration that would be obtained by saturating the juice at atmospheric pressure. The pressure of the mixture of gases (3) injected into the juice (1) can be between the initial pressure exerted by the juice ( 1) to about a pressure of about 20 bars.<br>
Multiple gas injectors (13) can be used in series or in parallel, and each gas injector can have multiple gas injection ports (17) at substantially the same location or different locations in a series or in parallel. Each injection port (17) may be separately or variably controlled with respect to the volume and pressure of the mixture of gases (3) injected in the juice (1). The variably adjustable injection ports (17) can be made responsive to the volume of juice (1), the residence time of the juice in the gas injector (13), the concentration or amount of dissolved materials (5) in the juice (1), or the concentration of dissolved gases in the juice (1), or the like.<br>
With respect to other embodiments of the invention, the mixture of gases (3) can be injected into the juice (1) prior to the pump (14), whereby the pump (14) can act to distribute the mixture of gases (3) with the stream of juice (1) to generate the mixed stream (19 ) and increased interface surface area (4). As to certain types of pumps, the<br><br>
mixed stream (19) can comprise at least 35% mixture of gases with substantially 100% saturation of the stream of juice (1) with bubbles of the mixture of gases (3). As but one example, a Shanley Pump, can be used to generate the mixed stream (19). Shanley Pump, hereby incorporated by reference herein. A plurality of pumps (14) can be run in series or parallel as required to process a certain volume of juice (1) within the desired duration of time.<br>
With respect to other embodiments of the invention, a stream of juice (1) can be further configured to provide a venturi effect, or otherwise develop a reduced pressure responsive to the stream of juice (1) to draw the mixture of gases (3) into the stream of juice (1), whether pulstile, continuous, or intermittent.<br>
With respect to certain embodiments of the invention, only a portion of the stream of juice (1) may be exposed to the mixture of gases (3). For example, if the juice (1) contains a low amount of dissolved material (5), then the stream of juice (1) can be split and only a portion of the juice (1) exposed to the mixture of gases (3). The streams of juice (1) can then later be recombined in the proportions desired.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 3, with respect to other embodiments of the<br>
invention, juice (1) can be sprayed through a juice distribution element (21), such as a<br>
nozzle. The juice distribution element (21) can create a spray of very fine juice droplets<br>
(22) or particles. As such, spraying generates an increased interface surface area (4). The<br>
juice can be sprayed in an aeration containment element (23) and the mixture of gases (3),<br>
whether or not filtered or scrubbed as described above, can be exposed to the sprayed<br>
juice droplets. Juice can be discharged into the top region of the aeration containment<br>
element (23) (e.g. via a spray nozzle) and then exposed to the mixture of gases (3) passed<br>
through the aeration containment element (23). The mixture of gases (3) can be passed<br>
through the aeration containment element (23) counter current to the direction of the of<br>
the juice droplets (22) to increase the efficiency of transfer of dissolved material (5) in the<br>
juice (1) to the mixture of gases (3). The aeration containment element (23) can be, for<br>
example, a 150 gallon tank but it can be appreciated that the size and shape of this tank<br>
can vary depending upon the quantity of the juice that is being processed.<br><br>
Again referring primarily to Figure 2, the invention can further include a gas separator (27) to release the mixture of gases (3) which contain dissolved material (5) transferred from the juice (1). In certain embodiments of the invention, where an aeration containment element (23) is utilized, as described above, the gas separator (27) can<br>
comprise an aperture in the aeration containment element allowing the mixture of gases passed through the aeration containment element to be discharged to atmosphere. In those embodiments of the invention where the gas injector (13) comprises a sparger (26), the gas separator (27) can be an aperture allowing the mixture of gases (3) containing dissolved material to be discharged to atmosphere. In those embodiments of the<br>
invention where the gas injector (13) introduces the mixture of gases (3) into a stream of juice (1) to generate a mixed stream of juice (19), whether continuous, pulsatile, or intermittent, transferred in a conduit closed from atmosphere, the gas separator (27) can comprise a portion of the conduit that further provides an interior volume fluidicly coupled to atmosphere. Specifically, the gas separator (27) fluidicly coupled to atmosphere can comprise a portion of the conduit configured to, or having restriction means to, adjust the time that the mixed stream (19) is responsive to atmosphere.<br>
Specifically, one configuration of the gas separator (27) can be an increase in the internal volume of the conduit to spread the mixed stream (19) over the interior surface of the conduit to increase the residence time that, or to increase the surface area when, the juice is fluidicly coupled to atmosphere, or both. In certain embodiments of the gas separator (27), the juice can be spread over a surface area sufficiently large to allow the mixture of gases (3) within the juice (1) to substantially equilibrate with atmospheric partial pressures prior to transfer of the juice from the gas separator (27). The interior surfaces of the gas separator (27) can be further configured to provide extensions, corrugates, grooves, or the like, to further mix or agitate the juice (1) within the gas separator (27) to increase the rate at which the mixture of gases (3) can be transferred from the juice (1) to atmosphere.<br>
A gas flow of the mixture of gases (28) transferred from the juice (1) to atmosphere can be generated by coupling a source of reduced pressure (29) to the gas separator (27). Reduced pressure involves generating.partial pressures of gases at the increased surface area (4) of the juice (1) that are lower than the partial pressures of the dissolved materials (5) transferred to the mixture of gases (3). As can be understood, the<br><br>
source of reduced pressure (29) can be atmosphere when the partial pressures of the mixture of gases containing dissolved materials (5) removed from the juice exceeds atmospheric pressure. With respect to some embodiments of the invention, as described above, a source of reduced pressure (29) can be generated by increasing the interior volume of the conduit in which the mixed stream (19) flows. The source of reduced pressure (29) can also be generated by a vacuum pump, a venturi, or other device fluidicly coupled to the gas separator (27). The partial pressure of gases generated at the increased surface area (4) of the juice can then be adjusted as desired (e.g. below atmospheric pressure) to increase the transfer rate of the mixture of gases (3) containing dissolved material (5) from the mixed stream (19) of juice.<br>
As to some embodiments, the gas separator can further include a relief valve (30) or further include a signal generator (31), coupled to the source of reduced pressure (29) that can be responsive to accumulation of, or partial pressures of, gases within the gas separator (27), or responsive to a reduction in dissolved materials in the juice (total dissolved material, certain dissolved materials, concentration of dissolved materials, or concentration of certain dissolved materials), a reduction in acidity of the juice, alkalinity of the juice, an increase in pH of the juice, or other measure, that indicates sufficient dissolved material has been transferred from the juice (1).<br>
The invention can further include storage or conveyance of the mixture of gases (32) containing dissolved materials removed from the juice that avoids discharging all or a portion to atmosphere. In certain embodiments of the invention the mixture of gases containing dissolved materials from the juice (e.g. containing carbon dioxide) can be utilized for carbonation steps as described above, as but one example.<br>
The invention can also include the addition of antifoaming agents (33) to the juice (1). Juice contains a large amount of material that can be surface active or that can alter the surface tension of water. As such, air inclusion within the juice, or dissolved gases transferred from the juice to atmosphere, can result in foam. There are many lands of antifoaming agents that can be used to reduce the amount of foam. Including, but not limited to, fatty acids, oils, or the like. To accomplish injection of the mixture of gases (3) into juice (1) or to transfer the mixture of gases (3 ) containing at least some dissolved material (5), as described above, can further require the step of adding an amount of<br><br>
antifoaming agent simultaneous with, or at about the time the juice is exposed to or injected with, the desired mixture of gases (3).<br>
Once the desired amount of dissolved material, volatile material, dissolved gases, aqueous acids, or the like, have been transferred from the juice (1) the resulting juice product can be transported to existing sugar process facilities for further clarification or purification. Alternately, the various embodiments of the invention can be incorporated into sugar process facilities to produce juice having reduced dissolved material in situ.<br>
Now referring to Figure 5, with respect to sugar process systems which utilize base, such as calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide, to raise pH for the purpose of initially reaching the iso-electric point of the various materials dissolved in the juice (1), or as part of conventional method of preliming juice (33) either separate from or in conjunction with further steps such as cold liming (34), main liming (35) or intermediate liming (36) again separate from or in conjunction with a first carbonation step (37) or second carbonari on step (38) that can result in a precipitate of calcium carbonate (39) to trap at least a portion of the non-sucrose substances from the juice (1) so that the resulting clarified or purified juice can be filtered (44) prior to evaporation (45) of the desired amount of water, the method and apparatus involving the invention can be utilized to produce a juice product having reduced dissolved material or reduced dissolved gases consistent for introduction into one, or more, or all of these conventional steps, or conventional steps modified to the extent to benefit from the characteristics of the juice treated in accordance with the invention.<br>
As can be appreciated the invention can be used to reduce dissolved materials within the juice prior to any addition of base. Because the invention can substantially increase the pH or reduce the acidity of the juice, the amount of base used in conventional preliming or main liming steps can be reduced. Alternately, in those process systems in which die underflow in the process system, such as spent lime, is used to neutralize some portion of the acid in the juice, or used to reduce foaming, the under flow can be introduced either before or after utilizing the invention<br>
Specifically, a method of purifying juice utilizing the invention can comprise obtaining juice (1) from plant material (2) where the juice as above described contains<br><br>
sucrose, non-sucrose substances, and water. Utilizing the invention in the various<br>
embodiments shown or described to either raise the pH or lower acidity of the juice prior<br>
to preliming (33) the juice. Cold main liming (34) the juice (1) or hot main liming (35),<br>
or both, can be utilized in conjunction with carbonating (37)(38). Where calcium oxide<br>
or calcium hydroxide has been employed as the base (46) in the preliming (33) or main<br>
liming (34)(35) steps, a carbonation step (37) precipitating calcium carbonate (39) can<br>
result in trapping at least a portion of the non-sucrose substances in the juice (1). These<br>
precipitates (39) allow removal of the trapped non-sucrose substances by separation of the<br>
juice (1) from the precipitates (39). In some embodiments of the invention, an<br>
intermediate liming (36) step in conjunction with an additional carbonation (38) step can<br>
be performed. Again precipitating calcium carbonate (39) can allow removal of trapped<br>
non-sucrose substances. Removing calcium carbonate precipitates (39) can yield a juice<br>
(1) that after by removing water content (45) to the desired amount can yield desired<br>
syrups (46). Alternately, crystallizing (47) the sucrose content within the juice can yield<br>
sugar products (48).<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 6, with respect to sugar process systems that utilize ion exchange (49) to replace conventional calcium carbonate purification steps in the sugar process system as described above, it can be understood from United States •Patent Nos. 3,785,863; 4,331,483; or 4,140,541, each hereby incorporated by reference, mat base, such as lime can be used to pretreat juice so that it may more readily be filtered prior to ion exchange steps (49), to regenerate ion exchange material to generate the calcium form so that the polar load of the juice is exchanged for calcium, or to reduce acidity of the juice after ion exchange processes.<br>
In these types of processes, the invention can be used to reduce the amount of dissolved materials, or dissolved gases, or reduce acidity of the juice prior to or in conjunction with pretreatment of the juice, or to reduce the polar load of the juice prior to ion exchange, or to reduce the acidity of the juice after the ion exchange steps. Each of these can be accomplished by processing the juice in accordance with the invention.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 7, with respect to sugar process systems that utilize filtration or ultrafiltration to replace conventional calcium carbonate purification steps in the sugar process system as described above, it can be understood from United<br><br>
States Patent No. 4,432,806, hereby incorporated by reference, that base, such as lime can be used to pretreat juice so that it may more readily be filtered (50).<br>
In these types of processes, the invention can be used to reduce the amount of dissolved materials, or dissolved gases, or reduce acidity of the juice prior to or in conjunction with pretreatment of the juice with base to allow non-sucrose substances to reach their isoelectric points and aggregate, or to otherwise generate solid particulates that can be filtered from the remaining liquid portion of the juice. Each of these can be accomplished by processing the juice in accordance with the invention.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 8, the invention can include apparatus for processing or methods of processing liquids containing sucrose, or diffusion juice(s), which take advantage of the lower solubility of pH reducing materials in such liquids. As sucrose containing liquids are heated the solubility of certain materials including gases, such as C02 and S02 decreases. As such, the transfer of these materials from such liquids can be initiated or increased at the interface between such liquid and a mixture of partial pressures of gases, even when the material could not be transferred, or could not be further transferred to such partial pressure of gases at a lower liquid temperature.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 9, a particular embodiment of the invention is shown in which sugar beet cossettes (51) are introduced into a mixer (52) typically with a conveyor belt or other conveyance means, or alternately, sugar beet cossettes (51) can be introduced directly into a cossette diffuser (53) using a pump (54). In particular embodiments of the invention in which sugar beet cossettes (51) are introduced into the mixer (52), the sugar beet cossettes (51) may within the mixer (52) be exposed to a portion, or all, of the diffusion juice or effluent (55) from the cossette diffuser (53) before being transferred by a pump (54) to the cossette diffuser (53).<br>
In the diffuser (53) the sugar beet cosettes are treated with heated water (59) (typically between 50°C and 80°C), sometimes in a counter current fashion, to remove or transfer sugar beet juice (which can contain a variety of other soluble and non-soluble substances and materials as described above) from the sugar beet cossettes (51) to the heated water (59). The heated water (59) now wmtaining sugar beet juice diffused from the sugar beet cossettes (51) (sometimes referred to as "diffusion juice") is collected and<br><br>
transferred by pump (60) to the mixer (52) in a single or in multiple effluent streams (55)(58).<br>
Importantly, while diffuser technology has been used for decades, it has not been known until the instant invention that the diffuser (53) itself can prevent or reduce transfer of certain substances or pH reducing materials from the diffuser liquids resulting in diffusion juice which can contain amounts of certain substances or materials which can be reduced in accordance with the invention. Embodiments of the invention take advantage of the increased temperatures used during diffusion of sugar beet cossettes and which reduces solubility of certain substances contained in diffuser liquids, pulp liquids, diffusion juice, or the like, to remove, reduce or transfer certain substances or materials such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, nitriles, sulfides, pyrazines, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, sulfur dioxide, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, maleic acid, propanoic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, butanoic acid, pentanoic acid, 5-methylhexanoic, hexanoic, heptanoic, or lactic acid.<br>
The monitoring, assessment, and manipulation of the diffusion juice, pulp juice, or other diffusion liquids with the configurations of the invention (such as those shown by Figures 1 to 7 and 11, 12, 13 and described herein) to take advantage of higher temperatures (lower solubility of pH reducing material) of the diffusion liquids or diffusion juice can occur at the diffuser (53) itself or at various locations as shown in Figure 9 (200)(201)(202) to treat pulp press liquids or to treat diffusion juice between the diffuser (53) and the pre-limer (57). Heaters (T)(203)(204) can be added in line to maintain juice or diffusion juice to establish or maintain temperature of the juice between about 60°C and about 80°C. Various embodiments of the invention with heaters can establish or maintain juice at about 60°C, about 61°C, about 62°C, about 63°C, about 64°C, about 65°C, about 66°C, about 67°C, about 68°C, about 69°C, about 70°C, about 71°C, about 72°C, about 73°C, about 74°C, about 75°C, about 76°C, about 77°C, about 78°C, about 79°C, about 80°C, or other temperature as desired.<br>
As such, there are numerous embodiments of the invention which manifest a variety of configurations for use with diffusers and diffusion technology of sugar beet<br><br>
cossettes, certain of these configurations are shown by shown by Figure 9 (showing exemplary locations (200)(201)(202) at which the various configurations of the invention such as those shown by Figures 10 to 13 and described below can be positioned) which provide a sufficient number of illustrative examples to make and use the various embodiments of the invention. These illustrative examples are not to be considered limiting with respect to the wide variety of alternate embodiments not shown.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention comprise a controlled exchange rate of atmospheric partial pressures or maintains a partial pressure of gases (62) within the diffuser that provides for additional transfer of substances or pH reducing materials from heated diffusion juices (205) within the diffuser (53). In some embodiments of the invention, the diffuser (53) can be modified to include additional fluidic coupling with the atmosphere to allow increased exchange of atmospheric partial pressures at the surface of the heated diffusion juice. In other embodiments of the invention a gas flow generator (64) can be installed where the configuration of the diffuser cannot be modified to increase exchange of atmospheric pressures within the diffuser (53). Increased ventilation (63) may be balanced with the established gas flow within the diffuser (53). Assessment element(s)(65) which monitors the transfer of certain substances from the diffuser liquids to the gas flow can provide information about the exchange rate of substances between the diffuser liquids or atmospheric partial pressures (or other selected mixtures of gases or partial pressures of gases) at the diffusion juice interface can be controlled.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 10, other embodiments of the invention comprises heated diffusion juice (66) transferred by means of a pump (60) or other liquid conveyance to a containment element (67) that increases the surface area of the heated diffusion juice (66) to provide a greater reduction in concentration of pH reducing materials (or the desired level of pH reducing materials, such as C02 or S02) or to generate a more rapid transfer of the pH reducing materials from the heated diffusion juice. The increased surface area (or the desired surface area which could also be adjustably variable) of the heated diffusion juice (66) can be obtained in various ways as described above by injection of desired partial pressures of gases to strip the diffusion juice, sprayed into a containment element, or delivered over a increased area substrate.<br><br>
Certain embodiments of the invention can include container (67) having a substantially open top and can further provide a substantially open bottom (which for convenience can have a reduced size opening to transfer treated diffusion juice to the mixer, a settling tank (68), or pump (56)(54), or other transfer means. The heated juice (66) from the diffuser can be introduced near the top of the container (67) such that the heated juice (66) has a substantially increased surface area with respect to atmospheric partial pressures within the container. As shown in Figure 10, one embodiment of the invention introduces the heated juice near the top of the container (67) such that the heated juice spreads over the interior walls and can have sufficient force to spiral down at least a portion of the height of the interior surface to increase the residence time in the container (67).<br>
As to some embodiments of the invention, the manner of introduction of the heated juice into the container (67) can be the means of increasing the surface area of the heated juice (66) while the container (67) serves only to contain and collect the treated diffusion juice. In these embodiments of the invention the configuration of the fluid stream of heated juice can be modified to create additional surface area fluidicly coupled to atmospheric or desired partial pressures of gases by agitation, pulsation, division into multiple streams, spraying, droplet formation, or otherwise.<br>
Alternate embodiments of the invention can utilize the configuration of the container (67) to optimize the increase in surface area of the heated diffusion juice (66). For example, the container can have a circular or conical configuration or even a variably adjustable configuration that controllably increases or decreases the surface area of the heated juice introduced onto the container (67) surface and the residence time on the surfaces of the container. As to some embodiments of the invention the container can be an increase in the diameter of the conduit (69) transferring the juice providing fluidic coupling with atmospheric partial pressures or the desired partial pressures of gases can be injected into the conduit to strip the heated diffusion juice of pH reducing materials or undesirable strippable components.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the partial pressures of gases to which the surface area of the heated juice is exposed can be controlled by evacuation or desired exchange of selected mixtures of gases to maintain a continuously lower concentration of<br><br>
desired partial pressures of gases to increase transfer of the desired gases or materials from the heated diffusion juice, including gas stripping as described above.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figure 11, a further embodiment of the invention can comprise a pump (70) or other liquid transfer element that achieves adequate process liquid pressure (between about 20 pounds per square inch and about 25 pounds per square inch) at the an injection port of an gas injector (71). As described above, the process liquid may be heated to between about 50°C to about 80°C to decrease solubility of gases in the process liquid, such as CO2, SO2, volatile organic compounds, or volatile inorganic compounds, or otherwise described above, in the process liquid. After air or other partial pressures of gases as desired, are injected into the process liquid at the injection port (71), the process liquid can be transferred to a gas-liquid separator (72) which in some embodiments of the invention can be a centrifugal gas-liquid separator that can achieve forces of about four times gravity. The gas-liquid separator (72) allows partial pressures of gases injected into the process liquid to transfer dissolved gases, volatile organic compounds, or volatile inorganic compounds to atmosphere to lower the concentration of these materials in the process liquid. In some embodiments of the invention, the gas-liquid separator can be a container that contains the process liquid in a manner that increases the atmosphere-process liquid interface allowing the transfer of materials from the process liquid to the atmosphere in a shorter duration of time. When a centrifugal gas-liquid separator is used, centrifugal forces applied to the process liquid can spread the process liquid over the inside surface of a cylindrical container (although other configurations can be used as well) with forces in some cylindrical embodiments of the invention of about four times gravity. Spreading the process liquid over the inside surface of the cylindrical container of the centrifugal gas-liquid separator increases the area of the atmosphere (or other partial pressures of gases)-process liquid interface by maintaining a column of gases at the center of the cylindrical to which gases in the process liquid can be transferred to. A gas relief system (73) allows partial pressures of gases transferred from the process liquid to atmosphere. In some embodiments of the invention, the process liquid from the gas-process liquid separator (72) can enter the pre-liming step of convention sugar process systems, or enter other processing steps as described above.<br><br>
As to other embodiments of the invention, pump (74) or other process liquid transfer element transfers process liquid to a liquid dispersion element (76), such as a nozzle, to distribute the process liquid in a manner that increases the atmosphere (or other partial pressure of gases)-process liquid surface area. In some embodiments the liquid dispersion element (76) can create droplets or a spray. A gas distribution manifold (77) or other gas distribution element moves air or other partial pressure of gases through the dispersion of process liquid to further allow gas partitioning between dissolved gases, volatile organic compounds, or volatile acids, or the like, in the process liquid and the partial pressure gases introduced by the gas distribution manifold. In some cases, the flow of such partial pressure of gases introduced by the gas distribution manifold (77) can be counter current to the direction of the dispersed process liquid from the liquid dispersion element (76) to make the process of gas partitioning or gas stripping more efficient A foam dispersion element (78) can be further included to knock down foam generated by the liquid during the gas partifioning or gas stripping process. A mesh or screen having apertures of a suitable size can be used. The liquid dispersion element (76), the gas distribution manifold (77) and the foam dispersion element (78) can be located inside a containment element (79) or gas partition column. Gas flow volume to the gas distribution manifold (77) can be established with a gas transfer element (80). The gas flow volume can be regulated in amount based upon analysis of the conditions within the containment element (79) or the chemical conditions within the process liquid, separately or in combination. In some embodiments of the invention the process liquid can enter the pre-liming step of convention sugar process systems, or enter other processing steps as described above.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention can further include a vacuum chamber (84) into which process liquid can be transferred. The pressure within the vacuum chamber (S4) can be adjusted or regulated to transfer the desired amount of volatile materials from the volume of process liquid passed through the vacuum chamber (84) (or achieve the desired pH). The vacuum within the chamber can be generated by a vacuum pump, or with respect to some embodiments of the invention movement of liquid through an eductor system (88) (89)(90). The amount of process liquid entering the vacuum chamber (84) can also be regulated by a liquid control valve (81) and can be dispersed through a second liquid dispersion element (82) to increase the process liquid-gas interface area. The process liquid can then be transferred from the vacuum chamber (84) to the pre-<br><br>
liming step of convention sugar process systems, or enter other processing steps as described above.<br>
The invention can further comprise a vent system (91) from various components (72)(79)(84)(90) to transfer overflow process liquid or process liquid foam to a vent collection container (93) into which an anti-foam agent can be added through an anti-foam agent dispersion element (92). The process liquid collected in the vent collection container (93) can then be transferred from the vacuum chamber (84) to the pre-liming step of convention sugar process systems, or enter other processing steps as described above.<br>
Now referring primarily to Figures 12 and 13, an embodiment of the invention can comprise an a juice treatment system which provides juice dispersal element (300) which can as a non-limiting example be a BEX PSQ full square spray nozzle or a BEX PSWSQ<br>
wide angle full square spray nozzle (300). See for example	.<br>
Juice (301), whether or not heated as described above, can be dispersed into a gas (302),<br>
or a mixture of gases, or partial pressure of gases (such as atmospheric gases, or<br>
atmospheric gases supplemented or stripped to the desired partial pressures) having gas<br>
characteristics that allow transfer of at least one substance from said juice to said gas. An<br>
adjustable gas flow generator (303) maintains a flow of said gas (302) sufficient to<br>
maintain said gas characteristics (gas partial pressures, gas volume, gas residence time,<br>
gas velocity, or the like) which allow transfer of said at least one substance from said<br>
juice to gas (302). A gas discharge element(s)(304) allow gas containing substances<br>
transferred from the juice to discharge to the atmosphere or be carried to a desired<br>
location or be discharged to a desired process or into a desired process step. Gas flow<br>
(302) can be established by a single gas discharge location or by multiple gas discharge<br>
locations (305). In certain embodiments of the invention gas is first directed to a gas<br>
distribution element (310), such as the gas distribution ring shown in Figure 13 (providing<br>
numerous apertures (313) in the ring). The gas distribution element serves to generate<br>
desired gas flow characteristics within the containment vessel (312), whether counter<br>
current or otherwise.<br>
For example, juice (301), diffusion juice, pulp juice, diffuser liquids, or juice process liquids dispersed at about 60 to about 110 cubic foot per minute (about 500 to 133<br><br>
gallons per minute) dispersed into flow of gas generated at about 450 to 850 cubic foot per minute can result in a transfer from the juice to the gas flow of certain substances such as alcohol, an aldehyde, a ketone, an ester, a nitrile, a sulfide, a pyrazine, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, sulfur dioxide, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, glycolic acid, pyrrolidone-carboxylic acid, formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, maleic acid, propanoic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, butanoic acid, pentanoic acid, 5-methythexanoic, hexanoic, heptanoic, and lactic acid, or the like. With respect to embodiments of the invention such as those configurations shown in Figures 12 and 13 a gas flow (302) in cubic feet of about four times the amount of juice dispersed (301) has been used to reduce the amount of a variety of substance in diffusion juice obtained from sugar beets. See Examples 1 through 3. Similarly, the juices obtained from milled sugar cane can be treated similarly with similar results. Depending upon the amount of juice dispersed and the gas flow generated the configuration can be sized accordingly or multiple components comprising the invention can be used in series or in parallel to treat juice generated by a typical sugar beet process facility (typically between 1000 to 5000 gallons of diffusion juice per minute).<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention further include a supplemental gas flow generator (306) to generate supplemental gas flow (307) which can comprise oxygen, ozone, air stripped of certain partial pressures of gases, an oxidant capable of converting primary alcohols to corresponding aldehydes or carboxylic acids. Alternately, embodiments of the invention further include supplemental oxidants (308) which can be dispersed into the dispersed juice through nozzle (311).<br>
As discussed above, a heater (309) can establish or maintain juice at a substantially constant temperature selected within the range of 60°C and 80°C as said juice (301) disperses into said gas (302) having gas characteristics which allow transfer of said at least one substance from said juice to said gas. As to different embodiments of the invention, juice can have a temperature as said juice (301) disperses into said gas (302) having gas characteristics which allow transfer of said at least one substance from said juice (301) to the gas selected from the group consisting of about 60°C, about 61°C, about 62°C, about 63°C, about 64°C, about 65°C, about 66°C, about 67°C, about 68o0, about<br><br>
69°C, about 70°C, about 71°C, about 72°C, about 73°C, about 74°C, about 75°C, about 76°C, about 77°C, about 78°C, about 79°C, and about 80°C.<br>
Some embodiments of the invention can further include baffles (311) to increase the area of interface between dispersed juice (301) and the gas (302) having gas characteristics which allow transfer of at least one substance from said juice to said gas.<br>
Treatment of juice as described above can occur in a first containment element (312) as shown in Figure 13 after which treated juice is transferred from an exit port (314) to the prelimer (57) or other process step or can be transferred to a second containment element (315). In those embodiments, in which the treated juice is transferred to a second containment element, juice (301) can again be dispersed by at least one second dispersal element (316). A pressure reduction generator (317) can reduce pressure within said second containment element (316) to reduce gas partial pressures which allows transfer of at least one substance from said juice (301) to lowered partial pressures of gas (318).<br>
The pressure reduction generator establishes and maintains a reduced pressure (3IS) within the second containment element (315) sufficient to boil dispersed juice (102). The reduced pressure (318) within the second containment element (315) can be varied or adjusted (automatically or manually) based upon the temperature of, composition of dispersed juice (301). A stripping gas flow generator (319) can introduce a flow of stripping gas (320) into the second containment element (315) to transfer volatilized substances to atmosphere. The stripping gas (320) can comprise air, atmospheric gases, nitrogen, oxygen, other desired gas.<br>
Certain embodiments of the invention can further include a supplemental gas reduction generator (321) to assist gas reduction generator (317) in establishing or mamtaining boiling of dispersed juice (301) in the second containment element (315).<br>
Similar to the first containment element (312) baffles (311) can be included in the second containment element (315) to increase the area of interface between the juice (301) and the reduced partial pressures of gas (318).<br><br>
Some embodiments of the invention can comprise a third containment element (322) in which a reduced pressure can be established and maintained as described above. Juice (301) can be transferred from the second containment element (315) through exit port (323) and dispersed into the third containment element through a juice disbursement element similar to that in the first and second containment elements. Alternately, juice (301) exiting the second containment element (315) can be transferred directly to the preliming steps or filtration steps or other steps or processes as desired.<br>
These examples of specific embodiments of the invention are specifically intended to be illustrative of the broader generic concept of utilizing the lowered solubility of heated juice to certain materials, gases, volatile compounds, acids, or the like to affirmatively monitor, assess, or control the concentration of these materials through one of or a combination of controlling the partial pressures of gases presented to the surface of heated diffusion juices or increasing the surface area of the heated juice exposed to a desired partial pressure of gases prior to pre-liming steps. The advantages of the invention are to be understood even in the context of small additions of base such as lime to control foaming of juice(s) during processing prior to the pre-liming step.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet cossettes. A control group and an experimental group each consisting of six substantially identical 500 mL aliquots of the diffusion juice were generated. Each aliquot within the control group and the experimental group was analyzed to ascertain the pH value. As to each aliquot of the diffusion juice in the control group the pH value was about 6.3. Each aliquot within the control group without any further treatment was titrated to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 50% wt./vol. caustic soda Each aliquot within the experimental group was treated in accordance with the invention after which the pH of each aliquot was ascertained and each experimental aliquot titrated in substantially identical fashion to the control group to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 50% wt./vol. caustic soda.<br>
The results are set out in Table 1 below. As can be understood from the table each aliquot of juice prior to any treatment had a pH of about 6.3. The experimental group after treatment in accordance with the invention had increased pH values without<br><br>
the addition of any base, and required a reduced amount of caustic soda to achieve the 11.2 pH endpoint as compared to the control group.<br><br><br>
The reduction in the amount of caustic soda to reach the 11.2 pH endpoint for the aliquots of juice in the experimental group treated in accordance with the invention as compared to the aliquots of juice in the untreated control group was between about 15.8% and about 22.2%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2.<br>
Juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet cossettes. A control group and an experimental group each consisting of five substantially identical 500 mL aliquots of the diffusion juice were generated. Each aliquot within the control group and the experimental group was analyzed to ascertain the pH value. As to each aliquot of the diffusion juice in the control group the pH value was about 6.1. Each aliquot within the control group without any further treatment was titrated to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 30 brixs milk of lime. Each aliquot within the experimental group was treated in accordance with the invention after which the pH of each aliquot was ascertained and each experimental aliquot titrated in substantially identical fashion to the control group to an 11.2 pH endpoint with a solution of 30 brixs milk of lime.<br>
The results are set out in Table 2 below. As can be understood from the table each aliquot of juice prior to any treatment had a pH of about 6.1. The experimental group after treatment in accordance with the invention had increased pH values without the<br><br>
addition of any base, and required a reduced amount of milk of lime to achieve the 11.2 pH endpoint as compared to the control group.<br><br>
The reduction in the amount of milk of lime to reach the 11.2 pH endpoint for the aliquots of juice in the experimental group treated in accordance with the invention as compared to the aliquots of juice in the untreated control group was between about 25.0% and about 28.3%.<br>
Also, the data set out in Table 1 and Table 2 provides a comparison of two different types of diffusion apparatus and diffusion methods. Importantly, the data shows that different diffusers or different diffusion methods can generate diffusion juice having significantly different pH values even though pH values attributed to each type of diffusion technology can be substantially internally consistent. See for example the initial pH value of the untreated diffusion juice in Table 1 which shows a pH value of 6.3 as compared to the untreated diffusion juice in Table 2 which a pH value of 6.1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3.<br>
Diffusion juice was obtained by conventional tower diffusion of sugar beet cossettes and treated in accordance with the invention using the embodiment shown by Figures 12 and 13 having location between the mixer and the pre-limer. Diffusion juice dispersed at a rate of about 100 cubic foot per minute into a flow of atmospheric gases generated at a rate of about 400 cubic foot per minute (counter current path of 72 inches x<br><br>
72 inches with counter current path height of about 144 inches) generated transfer a variety of substances from the dispersed juice as identified by gas chromatograph/mass spectra analysis shown in Tables 1 and 2 below:<br><br>
Table 1 shows gas chromatography analysis of samples SMBSC 1 and SMBSC 2 (condensates obtained from gas flow after counter current exchange with juice as described herein) with the chromatographs of those samples compared with a gas chromatograph of a sample of a standard mixture of organic acids listed as 1-9 above. As can be understood, treatment of juice in accordance with the invention removed varying amounts of each organic acid included in the standard mixture.<br><br><br>
Table 2 shows gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry analysis of sample SMSBC5 D (condensates obtained from gas flow after counter current exchange with juice as described herein without use of reduced pressure with a juice temperature of between 60°C and 70°C with the chromatograph of this sample showing various volatile compounds rising above a base line having a curvature predominated by a variety of alcohols.<br>
Each of these compounds has been identified with GCMS and the kekule structures are set out below in Table 3:<br><br><br>
While there may be different types of diffusion apparatus and different diffusion methods, there is a lack of recognition within the ordinary skill in the art that pH can be altered or reduced during diffusion of sugar beet material or other types of plant material, or a lack of recognition that different diffusion apparatus or different methods yield juice or liquids having different pH values, or a lack of recognition that newer types of diffusers typically result in diffused juice that has lower pH values. To the extent that diffusion technology generates diffusion juice having different pH values using the same diffusion technology or different diffusion technology, or that improvements to diffusion technology have altered or reduced the pH value of diffusion juice, it can be understood that these conventional approaches to extracting juice from plant material teach away from the teaching of the invention.<br>
