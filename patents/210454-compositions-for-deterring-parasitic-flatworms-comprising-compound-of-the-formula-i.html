"COMPOSITIONS    FOR   DETERRING    PARASITIC    FLATWORMS    COMPRISING COMPOUND OF THE FORMULA (I)"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a German company, of D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  invention  and  the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
597/MUM/01<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries Sto/ngb/NT<br>
The present invention relates to composition for deterring parasitic flatworms comprising one compound of the formula (I).<br>
The present invention relates to compositions comprising certain active compounds which are suitable as repellents, and to their use for preventing an infection of humans or of animals by the infectious stages of parasitic flatworms (platyhelminths). The compositions are used on the skin against the flatworm stages which are capable of penetrating through the skin into the host organism (cercariae).<br>
Several platyhelminth species cause serious diseases in humans and animals. In<br>
5	tropical countries, infections with Schistosoma species in particular cause chronic<br>
suffering and frequently death. Important pathogens are Schistosoma mansoni,<br>
Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma japonicum. Affected are the local<br>
population, tourists, people working for humanitarian aid organizations and military<br>
personnel. In the case of infections of humans, the infectious cercariae, which are<br>
10	present in the water of open bodies of water penetrate through the skin into the body.<br>
Likewise problematic, in countries with a moderate climate, is the infection of<br>
humans  by   cercariae   of various   species   of the   genera  Trichobilharzia   and<br>
Ornithobilharzia, which can drill into the skin, causing dermatitis. Such infections<br>
15	occur during leisure activities on inland waters or sea coasts and during fishing,<br>
working on ponds or watering fields. In general, in many situations of daily life, contact of the skin with possibly contaminated/infected water is unavoidable.<br>
Protection against penetration of the pathogens is, however, possible by pretreating<br>
20	the skin according to the invention with anthelmintic substances.<br>
In the past, some compounds have already been tested for their suitabality for<br>
preventing infections with such parasites. However, the substances hitherto described<br>
for the purposes according to the invention are toxic if they get into the body either<br>
25	through the skin or orally:<br>
Thus, for example, hexachlorophene has a lethal effect on cercariae of Schistosoma<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
mansoni (Fripp, P. J. and Armstrong, F. I., The efficacy of hexachlorophene skin cleanser as a cercariae repellent. South African Med. J. 47: 1973, 526-527). Because of health risks, in particular liver damage, hexachlorophene cannot be used on the skin of humans. It is toxic on contact with the skin and when swallowed, may possibly cause deformities and is possibly carcinogenic [Commission of the European Community, Directive 93/72/EEC of 1 September 1993, Annex Vol. I and II (EU Directive on Dangerous Substances) with amendments to 1999, Official Journal EUL258A, Volume 36,16 October 1993, Amendments to 1997].<br>
Niclosamide acts against the penetration of cercariae [Bruce, J. I. et al. (1992) Efficacy of niclosamide as a potential topical antipenetrant (TAP) against cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni in monkeys. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz 87:28,1-289.] but is toxicologically objectionable since it may possibly cause inheritable genetic damage (Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health). Use on the skin in cases where the user is exposed to water has to be ruled out owing to the risk it poses to the environment, since niclosamide constitutes a water hazard [Federal Office for the Environment (Ed.), Catalogue of substances hazardous to water. LTwS No. 12 May 1996 with current amendments, Berlin 1996]. Accordingly, the compound has hitherto been used commercially in humans against cercariae.<br>
N,N-Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) acts against cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni [Salafsky, B. et al. Evaluation of N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) as a topical agent for preventing skin penetration by cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 58: 1998, 828-834). However, DEET has some unfavourable properties.<br>
The effect of the anthelmintics hitherto described against infectious stages of platyhelminths has hitherto only been tested on cercariae of the species Schistosoma mansoni, i.e. an efficacy of these agents against other worm species had hitherto not been demonstrated.<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compositions according to the invention are suitable for protecting humans and animals effectively against infections by platyhelminths, in particular Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma japonicum, Trichobilharzia spp. and Ornithobilharzia spp., but also Echinostoma spp. and others.<br>

Le A 34 3 03-Foreign Countries<br><br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) are either known, or they can be prepared by generally known methods and processes (cf., for example, Cesare Ferri, Reaktionen der organischen Synthese [Reactions of Organic Synthesis], Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 1978, p. 223 and p. 450, and also EP A 0 289 842).<br>
The active compounds contained in the compositions according to the invention have already been used specifically as repellents on the skin, against insects and ticks.<br>
A substantial advantage of using the compounds according to the invention is their high compatibility with the skin, plants and the environment and the generally low toxicity of these compounds.<br>
When staying outdoors, it is furthermore desirable to be protected against mosquitoes which, on the one hand, are considered a nuisance and, on the other hand, specifically in tropical regions, may transfer diseases such as malaria, various viruses, filaria and parasites by means of their sting. The compositions according to the invention now allow simultaneous prevention of platyhelminth infection and protection against mosquitoes, with only one composition. Thus, the necessity for using simultaneously two different, possibly incompatible compositions on the skin is avoided.<br>
In addition to the active compounds, the compositions according to the invention may also comprise all of the customary auxiliaries and additives used in formulations for topical application.<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
The active compounds are administered, either directly or in the form of suitable preparations, dermally or with the aid of shaped articles containing the active compound, such as, for example, strips, plates, tapes, collars, ear tags, limb bands or marking devices.<br>
Dermal administration is effected, for example, in the form of bathing, dipping, spraying, pouring-on or spotting-on, washing, shampooing, or powdering.<br>
Suitable preparations include:<br>
solutions or concentrates for administration after dilution, solutions for use on the skin,<br>
pour-on formulations, gels;<br>
emulsions and suspensions for dermal administration and also semisolid preparations;<br>
formulations in which the active compound is incorporated in an ointment base or in an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion base;<br>
solid preparations, such as powders, shaped articles containing the active compound.<br>
Solutions for use on the skin are applied drop by drop, brushed on, rubbed in, splashed on or sprayed on, or applied by dipping, bathing or washing.<br>

caprylic/capric acid biglyceride, a triglyceride mixture with vegetable fatty acids of chain length C8-12 or other specifically selected natural fatty acids, mixtures of partial glycerides of saturated or unsaturated fatty acids which may also contain hydroxyl groups, mono- and diglycerides of the C8/C10-fatty acids.<br>
Fatty acid esters, such as ethyl stearate, di-n-butyryl adipate, hexyl laurate, dipropylene glycol pelargonate, esters of a branched fatty acid having a medium chain length with saturated fatty alcohols of chain length C16-C18, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, caprylic/capric esters of saturated fatty alcohols of chain length C12-C18, isopropyl stearate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, ethyl oleate, ethyl lactate, waxy fatty acid esters such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl adipate, ester mixtures related to the latter, amongst others fatty alcohols, such as isotridecyl alcohol, 2-otyldodecanol, cetylstearyl alcohol or oleyl alcohol.<br>
Fatty acids, such as, for example oleic acid and its mixtures.<br>
Suitable hydrophilic phases include:<br>
water, alcohols, such as, for example, propylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol and their<br>
mixtures.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers include: nonionic surfactants, for example polyethoxylated castor oil, polyethoxylated sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan monostearate, glycerol monostearate, polyethoxy stearate, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers;<br>
ampholytic surfactants, such as disodium N-lauryl-fl-iminodipropionate or lecithin;<br>
anionic surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulphate, fatty alcohol ether sulphates, and the monoethanolamine salt of mono/dialkylpolyglycol ether orthophosphoric ester;<br>
cationic surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
Other suitable auxiliaries include: substances which increase the viscosity and stabilize the emulsion, such as carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose and other cellulose and starch derivatives, polyacrylates, alginates, gelatin, gum arabic, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, methylvinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymers, polyethylene glycols, waxes, colloidal silica, or mixtures of the listed substances.<br>
Suspensions are prepared by suspending the active compound in a liquid excipient, if appropriate with the addition of other auxiliaries, such as wetting agents, colorants, bioabsorption promoters, preservatives, antioxidants and photostabilizers.<br>
Suitable liquid excipients include all homogeneous solvents and solvent mixtures.<br>
Suitable wetting agents (dispersants) include the surfactants indicated further above.<br>
Other suitable auxiliaries include those indicated further above.<br>
Semi-solid preparations for dermal administration differ from the suspensions and emulsions described above only in that they have a higher viscosity.<br>
To prepare solid preparations, the active compound is mixed with suitable excipients, if appropriate with the addition of auxiliaries, and the mixture is formulated as desired.<br>
Suitable excipients include all physiologically acceptable solid inert substances. Suitable for this purpose are inorganic and organic substances. Inorganic substances are, for example, sodium chloride, carbonates, such as calcium carbonate, hydrogen carbonates, aluminium oxides, silicas, clays, precipitated or colloidal silica, and phosphates.<br>
Auxiliaries are preservatives, antioxidants and colorants which have already been mentioned further above.<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
Other suitable auxiliaries are lubricants and glidants, such as, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, bentonites.<br>
It is furthermore desirable for such a protective agent to have a sufficient protective action even after prolonged contact with water, for example when swimming, washing clothes or fishing. To this end, the compositions according to the invention may additionally comprise water-repelling or water-proof substances.<br>
Suitable water-proof substances are already being used in sun protection compositions which are to protect the user against the UV radiation from the sun (for example US 5 518 712 and US 4 810 489). Here, it is intended to maintain sun protection even after the user has been swimming, is sweating heavily, etc. Sun protection compositions which comprise such water-proof or water-repelling substances and insect repellents are already known (US 5 716 602). However, compositions which comprise anthelmintics have hitherto not been described.<br>
Accordingly, water-proof substances may also be present in the composition according to the invention. These may be substances which are soluble in fat and insoluble in water, and compounds which improve adherence of the composition to the skin.<br>
Skin protection products may comprise, as water-proof components, for example from 1 to 50% by weight of a polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyacrylates, silicones, etc.<br>
The compositions for topical application can be formulated as sprays, solutions, creams, ointments or layer- or film-forming compositions, according to the known processes for manufacturing cosmetics (Schrader, K. (1979) Grundlagen und Rezepturen der Kosmetika [Principles of and recipes for cosmetics], Dr. Alfred Hiithig Verlag, Heidelberg).<br><br>
For use, the formulations according to the invention are applied evenly and without any gaps onto the skin, in amounts appropriate for the user.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are of course also suitable for use on animals to prevent infection of the animals with parasites of these genera. The compositions can be used for pets, such as, for example, dogs and cats, and for economically useful animals, for example cattle, pigs, sheep, etc.<br>
When using tne"compositions according to the invention, in general from 0.03 to 1 mg, preferably from 0.03 to 0.1 mg and particularly preferably from 0.04 to 0.06 mg of the active compound are applied per cm2 of skin. This results in prophylactic protection against skin-penetrating worms and juvenile stages thereof If the user stays in the water for a longer time, the active compound has to be applied repeatedly.<br>
Accordingly,   the   present  invention  relates   to   composition  for  deterring parasitic flatworms comprising one compound of the formula (I)<br><br>
in which<br>
Y        represents radical O-X<br>
X        represent hydrogen<br>
R1       represents an optioning substituted C1-C4-alkyl, C3-C7alkenyl or C6-cycloalkyl<br>
R2       represents C1-alkyl, and R3 represents in this case hydrogen or<br>
R2 and R3 together with the atoms to which they are  attached form a pipelidine ring,<br><br>
R4 to R10 represent hydrogen and<br>
n=l and m= 0, characterized in that the composition contain, 0.06vol% compound of formula (I), 0.028%vol% polyethylene glycol ester 300 and 99.66vol% water.<br>
the,. examples  below .illustrate the compositions according to the invention, but without limiting tnem.<br>
20	Activity against Schistosoma mansoni cercariae<br>
[500ul/1 final concentration of the active compounds]<br>
Snails (Biomphalaria glabrata) were infected by incubating each of tnem with 8<br>
miracidia in 10 ml of Water overnight. About 6 to 9 weeks after me infection,<br>
25	cercariae were obtained by irradiating, the snails, which had been keptin_darkness,<br>
with light, followed by collection of the swarming cercariae within 2 hours.<br>
Such an amount of cercariae-containing water (1 or 2 ml, see below) was added to the test batches that each batch contained about 100 to, 150 cercariae.<br><br>
Le A 34 303-Foreign Countries<br>
5 ul of active compound were mixed thoroughly with 25 ul of PEG300. 9 ml of aquarium water was then added, and the batch was shaken vigorously. After (delayed) addition of 1 ml of cercariae suspension, survival of the cercariae was in each case observed immediately using a stereomagnifier. The activity of the active compounds was assessed using the following classification : 0 = no effect during the entire test period of 120 minutes; 1 = weak effect (the cercariae have a strongly reduced mobility); 2 = good effect (the cercariae are only slightly mobile and bent); 3 = full effect (the cercariae are completely immobile).<br>
Assessment of different compounds according to the invention:<br>
