				<td>WAVEFRONT ABERRATION AND DISTANCE MEASUREMENT PHASE CAMERA<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The system of the invention consists of a phase camera<br>
with microlenses placed in the focal point of a converging<br>
lens, wherein the camera data, processed using a combined<br>
Fourier "Slice" and fast Fourier transform edge detection<br>
technique, provide both a three-dimensional wavefront map and<br>
a real scene depth map within a broad range of volumes.<br>
This invention is suitable for use in any field where<br>
wavefronts need to be determined, such as earth-based<br>
astronomical observation, ophthalmology, etc., as well as in<br>
fields requiring metrology, e.g. real scenes, CCD polishing,<br>
automobile mechanics, etc. The invention is applied to the<br>
particular case of atmospheric tomography using ELTs (large-<br>
diameter telescopes: 50 or 100 metres).<br>
Field of the Art<br>
The invention is comprised in the field of optics and<br>
image processing.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to both the need for<br>
obtaining a three-dimensional wavefront measurement associated<br>
to any optical problem in which image quality is essential<br>
(e.g. for diagnosis) and to the need for obtaining a<br>
sufficiently reliable and precise depth map within a broad<br>
range of volumes, from a few microns up to several kilometers.<br>
Though the general approach can be applied to other<br>
fields, the analyses conducted focus on large aperture<br>
telescopes and on scene depth measurement.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Atmospheric tomography<br>
For present large-diameter telescopes (GRANTECAN,<br>
Keck,...) and future giant telescopes (50 or 100 metres in<br>
diameter) , the adaptive optics system has taken the course of<br>
measuring the three-dimensional distribution of the<br><br>
atmospheric phase by using a form of tomography called<br>
multiconjugate adaptive optics. The absence of a sufficient<br>
number of natural point sources in the sky, such that there is<br>
always one present within the field of vision of the object<br>
observed by the telescope, makes it necessary to use<br>
artificial point sources, e.g. Na stars (90 km high).<br>
In order to correct the entire atmosphere which affects<br>
the light beam coming from the object in the sky (avoiding<br>
focal anisoplanatism), it is necessary to use several of these<br>
artificial stars (at least 5) . In order to be generated, each<br>
of them requires a very high resolution and high powered<br>
pulsed laser, which translates into an incredibly expensive<br>
technology. Furthermore, after such a high cost, the<br>
multiconjugate adaptive optics can only measure the<br>
atmospheric phase associaited to at most three horizontal<br>
turbulence layers (with three phase sensors measuring<br>
simultaneously), i.e., it scans a minute proportion of the<br>
three-dimensional cylinder affecting the image. They also<br>
recover an estimation of the phase with calculations that are<br>
so complicated that they seriously compromise the adaptive<br>
correction of the optical beam within the stability time of<br>
the atmosphere in the visible spectrum (10 ms).<br>
The technique proposed herein will however allow:<br>
-being limited to a single measurement and to a single<br>
sensor, within each atmospheric stability time.<br>
-a recovery of the phase associated to each turbulent<br>
horizontal layer, i.e., tomography of the entire atmosphere,<br>
by means of an algorithm based on Fourier transform, which in<br>
and of itself is fast but can be accelerated with an<br>
intelligent adaptation thereof to graphics processing units<br>
(GPU) or to electronic hardware units, such as FPGA (Field<br>
Programmable Gate Arrays).<br>
-preventing the need to use artificial laser stars, as<br>
it will recover in real time the image of the object upon its<br>
arrival to the Earth' s atmosphere, since this new technique<br><br>
does not require calibration with a point signal to then be<br>
deconvoluted.<br>
Human eye tomography<br>
The main interest in performing human eye tomography is<br>
essentially based on obtaining and having available for<br>
medical specialists a clear image of the retinal fundus of the<br>
pacient, in order to make more reliable diagnoses. The aqueous<br>
humor, the vitreous humor and the lens behave in the eye as<br>
means which aberrate the image that can be obtained from the<br>
retinal fundus.<br>
In fact, it does not require taking measurements as<br>
frequently as in the Earth' s atmosphere (one every 10 ms) ,<br>
because it is a stable deformation; however it does require<br>
sufficient three-dimensional resolution to not only obtain a<br>
good image of the retinal fundus, but also to detect the<br>
spatial location of possible ocular lesions.<br>
The few authors who, within the mentioned fields, have<br>
placed microlenses in the focal point do not use the Fourier<br>
"Slice" technique to take the measurement of the optical<br>
aberration, or to correct the image, or to obtain distances.<br>
In addition, the Fourier "Slice" technique associated to<br>
microlenses in the focal point has only been used to obtain<br>
focused photographs of real scenes within ranges of a few<br>
cubic metres of volume, with a quality that apparently exceeds<br>
the common depth of field technique. In summary, these<br>
contributions of other authors have nothing to do with the<br>
patent herein described.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
A single array of microlenses, forming an image on a CCD<br>
with sufficient resolution and placed in the focal point<br>
position of a converging lens allows taking tomographic<br>
measurements of target three-dimensional space.<br>
The measurements are taken once only, i.e., a single<br>
image contains sufficient information to recover the three-<br>
dimensional environment. Such image can be understood as being<br><br>
made up of 4 dimensions: two coordinates on the CCD associated<br>
to the inside of each microlens and two other coordinates<br>
associated to the array of microlenses.<br>
The proposed technique is based on the Generalized<br>
Fourier "Slice" Theorem. The image taken by the CCD is Fourier<br>
transform in four dimensions, then a rotation and "slice"<br>
operator is applied to it, which decides the depth at which<br>
the object will be recovered and reduces the problem of 4<br>
dimensions to just 2. The objective of this invention is to<br>
find out the depths at which the objects are located; to that<br>
end, by working in the transformed domain and identifying the<br>
objects with the edge detection algorithm (high spatial<br>
frequencies), it is possible to identify the components of the<br>
scene of which it is previously known at what distance they<br>
are located.<br>
In addition, a Shack-Hartmann sensor consists of an<br>
assembly of lenses placed in array form to form the same<br>
number of images in a two-dimensional detector. The<br>
displacement of each of them in relation to the position<br>
corresponding to a planar wavefront measures the local<br>
gradient of the wavefront. It is possible to recover the<br>
original wavefront through numerical processes. The proposed<br>
phase camera contains a Shack-Hartmann in the focal point of a<br>
converging lens, which is why the design is also a wavefront<br>
phase camera, but placed in the focal point of a lens, with a<br>
completely different data processing than what has been<br>
associated up until now to the Shack-Hartmann sensor. It is<br>
then possible to recover both depths and wavefront phases.<br>

phase camera allows scanning the complete cylinder of<br>
atmospheric turbulence (13) which affects the final image of<br>
the telescope.<br>

observation of a star (8) using the adaptive optics<br>

and (10). It can only recover a very small number of<br>
individual turbulence layers (three layers at most). (11) and<br>
(12) indicate the wavefront sensors conjugately associated to<br>
each turbulent layer. (1) corresponds to the telescope.<br>
Preferred Embodiment of the Invention<br>
The particular case of an astrophysical observation with<br>
a telescope having a diameter exceeding the diameter of<br>
coherence r0 of the atmosphere (approximately 20 cm in the<br>
visible spectrum) is considered. The turbulence of the<br>
atmosphere causes a loss of resolution in the image obtained<br>
with the telescope, i.e., loss of high spatial frequencies<br>
information. To prevent this loss, it is necessary to know the<br>
manner in which the atmospheric turbulence degrades the<br>
wavefront of the light coming from the star under study.<br>
Natural or artificial point starts which allow characterizing<br>
the deformation that the atmosphere introduces in the<br>
wavefront can be used to that end.<br>
With classic multiconjugate adaptive optics (Figure 3),<br>
a wavefront phase sensor must be used for each deformable<br>
mirror conjugated to an individual turbulence layer, i.e. two<br>
different phase sensors (WFS) which must be aligned and placed<br>
in operation in parallel and in different positions of the<br>
optical axis. The complexity of the calculations and the need<br><br>
for velocity since the atmosphere changes every 10<br>
milliseconds in the visible spectrum, makes it impossible to<br>
overcome the correction today at only three atmospheric<br>
turbulence layers.<br>
With the phase camera having the design shown in Figure<br>
1, and whose operation in this case is shown in Figure 2, only<br>
one sensor is used, which sensor is placed in a single<br>
position of the optical axis, and a single measurement,<br>
subsequently processed by means of the Fourier Slice<br>
technique, will allow obtaining the three-dimensional map of<br>
turbulences (wavefront phases) associated to the entire column<br>
of atmosphere which affects the observation with the telescope<br>
of the invention, as well as the altitude at which these<br>
turbulence layers are located.<br><br>
