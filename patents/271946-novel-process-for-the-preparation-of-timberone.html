Thus, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of timberone (1), the process comprising the step of<br>
(a)	reacting citral with a 2-pentanone in the presence of an aldolization catalyst to produce 8,12-dimethyl-5,7,11-tridecatrien-4-one and<br>
(b)	cyclization of 8,12-dimethyl-5,7,11-tridecatrien-4-one in the presence of an acid to 1-(2,6,6-trirnethylcyclohex-2-en-1 -yl)-1-hexen-3-one and/or 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclo-hex-1-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one and<br>
(c)	hydrogenation of 1-(2,6,6-trimethyicyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one and/or<br>
1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one in the presence of Pt and /or Pd<br>
catalyst to timberone.<br>
Wherein the dotted line indicates a double bond which can be arranged in one of the two indicated positions. According to the nomenclature used for ionones they can also be referred to as a or p double bond (see Rompp-Lexikon Naturstoffe, Thieme, 1997, page 334-<br>
335)<br>
The timberone of formula (1) (i.e. the 1-(2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexan-1-yl)-1-hexan-3-one) obtainable via the process according to the invention may encompasses 4 different stereoisomers. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the timberone can be present in a stereochemically pure form or as a mixture of two or several stereoisomers in variable ratios.<br>
The term 'aldolization catalyst' as used in the present invention refers to catalysts being capable to catalyse aldol condensation reactions i.e. the addition of ketones and/ or aldehydes to obtain aidols ß-hydroxy ketones) followed by dehydration of the resulting aldol to obtain a α,ß-unsaturated ketones.<br>
Suitable aldolization catalyst to be employed in step (a) of the process according to the invention are any heterogeneous or homogeneous aldolization catalyst known to a skilled person in the art. Exemplary aldolization catalysts encompass bases such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, ion exchangers or supported catalysts. In all embodiments of the invention, preferred aldolization catalyst are heterogeneous aldolization catalysts i.e. supported catalyst which can be filtered off after the reaction is completed. In particular preferred are basic silica supported aldolization catalyst.<br>
In all embodiments according to the invention the use of Ca/Na on silica (Si02) as aldolization catalyst is preferred, especially a catalyst with a surface area 
In another preferred embodiment, the aldolization catalyst is selected from alkali hydroxides in an aqueous-organic phase or sodium ethoxide in an organic phase such as e.g. ethanol.<br>
The preparation of supported aldolization catalysts is well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, the basic silica supported catalyst which may be used in the process according to the invention is obtainable as e.g. disclosed in WO01/87812. Ca/Na on silica is e.g. obtainable by impregnating a silica support with an aqueous solution of a calcium compound, optionally and preferably in the presence of a sodium compound followed by drying and calcinations if necessary to effect decomposition to the respective basic compounds. As calcium and sodium compound any compounds which are basic or decompose to a basic compound upon heating such as for example calcium/ sodium hydroxide, acetate, oxalate, nitrate or carbonate may be used. As silica support any silica may be used such as e.g. silica support based on natural raw material or fumed pyrogenic silica which is e.g. available as Aerosil® / Aeroiyst® from Degussa AG, Hanau, Germany. In all embodiments of the invention, the Ca/ Na on silica catalyst preferably has a metal loading of about 15 to 35 wt-% Ca and about 20 to 35 wt.-% Na based on the total weight of the catalyst, more preferably a metal loading of about 20 to 30 wt.-% Ca and about 24 to 32 wt-% Na.<br>
The supported aldolization catalyst may be used as such or it may be suspended prior to its use. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the supported aldolization catalyst is added to the reaction mixture in pure solid form without further activation or modification. After termination of the reaction the catalyst can be recycled by simple technical measures such as filtration or decantation. The amount of the supported catalyst used in the process according to the invention is based on the amount of citral. In all embodiments of the invention, the amount of the supported aldolization catalyst is in the range of 5 to 30 wt%, preferably from 10 to 20 wt.-%, in particular in the range of 18 wt.-% based on citral. Such amounts of the supported aldolization catalyst are sufficient to obtain high yields of desired product.<br>
The aldolization reaction according to the invention can be carried out without an additional solvent or in the presence of an additional solvent. Suitable solvents for the aldol condensation reaction are non-polar aprotic solvents, e.g. toluene, xylene, or ethers, e.g. diethyl ether methyl t-butyl ether. Preferably, in all embodiments of the invention, the reaction is carried out without the addition of an additional solvent. The ratio of 2-pentanone to citral is not critical for the reaction and can vary over a wide range, although 2-pentanone is normally used as excess component in order to achieve high product selectivity in relation to citral. Good results are obtained if a molar ratio of the citral to the 2-pentanone of 1:0.5 to 1: 50, preferably 1:1 to 1:30, most preferably in the range of 1:10 to 1:3, in particular in the range of 1:4.4 is used.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a process according to the invention wherein the molar ratio of the citral to the 2-pentanone is selected in the range of 1:0.5 to 1: 50, preferably 1:1 to 1:30, most preferably in the range of 1:10 to 1:3, in particular in the range of 1:4.4<br>
The cydization of 8,12-dimethyl-5,7,11-tridecatrien-4-one can be performed in the presence of an acid such as e.g. a liquid acid (e.g. H3PO4 or MeSO3H) or a solid acid (acidic ion exchange). Preferably, the acid is selected from H3PO4 or a sulphur containing acid such as H2SO4, MeSO3H or F3CSO3H. Preferably, the cydization is performed in the presence of a sulfur containing acid, in particular in the presence of MeSO3H. The use of a sulfur containing acid leads to the preferred formation of the ß-isomer 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one. The ratio of a to ß isomers is in the range of 30:60 to 1:99 wt.-%. The<br>
cyclization according to the invention can be carried out without an additional solvent or in the presence of an additional solvent. Suitable solvents for the cyclization reaction are non-polar aprotic solvents, e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane without being limited thereto. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in the presence of heptane. The temperature range for the cyclization reaction can be easily determined by a person skilled in the art and depends on the catalyst used. Preferably, the cyclization reaction is carried out at low temperature in particular at a temperature selected in the range of -10 to 20°C, in particular in the range of -5 to 10 "C.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found, that the carbon carbon double bonds of 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one and/or 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one can be selectively hydrogenated to timberone in the presence of a Pd or Pt catalyst in high yields without reducing the carbonyl group. Further unexpected, it has been found that both forms (a and/ or p isomers) could be hydrogenated likewise to (all-rac)-timberone in quantitative yield at room temperature and low hydrogen pressure. Thus, the formation of the a- and/ or p-form in the cyclization step does not necessarily have to be selective. Thus, in all embodiments of the invention suitable hydrogenation catalysts are Pt and/ or Pd catalyst, in particular Pd catalyst on a solid support such as on carbon, alumina or silica, in particular Pd on carbon or Pd on alumina, more in particular Pd on carbon. The amount of the metal Pd or Pt on the solid support may vary in the range of 0.1 to 20 wt.-%, preferably in the range of 1 to 10 wt.-% such as 1, 5 or 10 wt.-%.<br>
The amount of the hydrogenation catalyst used in the reaction is not critical and can be easily established by a person skilled in the art. Preferably, an amount of 2 to 10 wt.-%, more preferably an amount of 6 to 9 wt.-% based on the 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one and/or 1-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-1-hexen-3-one is used. The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out without an additional solvent or in the presence of an additional solvent. Suitable solvents for the hydrogenation reaction are linear or cyclic hydrocarbon solvents, e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane or cyclohexane, aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, xylene without being limited thereto. The temperature range for the hydrogenation can be easily determined by a person skilled in the art and depends on the catalyst and/ or solvent used. Normally, the reaction is carried out at room temperature (i.e. 20-25°C) or at elevated temperatures such as e.g. 50-100°C. The hydrogenation can either be performed at normal pressure or at elevated pressure such as e.g. at 1 to 10 bar.<br>
The a and p isomer can be equally hydrogenated by the hydrogenation catalyst according to the invention in high yields.<br>
Each reaction of the process according to the invention can in principle be carried out in any reactor suitable for the respective reaction type. Without restricting generality, the following are mentioned by way of example: suspension reactor, stirred tank, stirred tank cascade, tubular reactor, shell-type reactor, shell and tube reactor, fixed-bed reactor, fluidized-bed reactor, reactive distillation column.<br>
