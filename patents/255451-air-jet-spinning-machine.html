OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG GERMAN Company LANDGRAFENSTRASSE-45, D-410 69 MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY<br><br>
3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a spinning machine according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In the drawing of fibre material through a drafting arrangement, which supplies fibre material with a desired draft to a spinning unit, wear symptoms occur on the rollers and the belts of the drafting arrangement, which necessitate the changing of the belts, the top roller coverings or the regrinding of the top rollers, in particular, which can only be repeated to a limited extent.<br>
In order to increase the service lives of the parts of the drafting arrangement which are subjected to wear, an approach prevails in the prior art according to which the fibre material is traversed while being guided through the drafting arrangement to avoid irregular wear of the rollers. This avoids the formation of grooves owing to the wearing in of the roller coatings because of the transporting and the drawing of the fibre material as the wear largely evens out over the surface of the top rollers or belts. A traversing of this type is known, for example, from DE 102 58 720 Al. It is proposed there to couple the traversing mechanism to at least one condenser and also to the air nozzle unit in terms of drive in order to achieve a reliable feed into the air nozzle unit if the latter traverses with the fibre band.<br>
DE 101 33 604 Al describes a device for guiding traverse guides back and forth, in which the traverse guides are controlled in such a way that the dwell time of the traverse guides is evened out over the width of the rollers.<br>
The drawback in the aforementioned prior art is that despite the traversing, the service lives of the drafting arrangement top rollers are comparatively short in particular in the case of air spinning machines, and conventional service lives are in the region of a few days, so frequent regrinding or frequent replacement of the drafting arrangement top rollers becomes necessary. Furthermore, the device for traversing requires a costly mounting of the spinning unit to ensure the precisely flush orientation of the spinning unit relative to the pair of delivery rollers. In addition, there is the problem when there is an interruption of the spinning process<br><br><br>
and subsequent repair by a service carriage which can be moved along the textile machine, that the traversing cannot be stopped during the piecing process if this involves a drive along the length of the machine for the traversing. To circumvent these problems, the use of single drives for traversing is required at each workstation and this is connected with a large technical outlay.<br>
The object of the present invention is to develop a spinning machine in such a way that relatively long service lives of the drafting arrangement top rollers are possible, wherein the drawbacks of the prior art are to be overcome in a simple and economical manner.<br>
This is achieved according to the invention by the characterising features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
It is proposed according to claim 1 that at least the top delivery rollers are arranged in relation to the spinning units in such a way that the material flow runs between the roller centre and one of the roller edges. Wear in the roller coatings is therefore displaced to an eccentric region of the top rollers or the belts. The one-sided wear allows, by detaching and turning around the top rollers, the undamaged surface of the latter to then be subjected to the fibre material flow. In this manner, the service life of the top rollers is doubled before the top rollers have to be reground. Compared to the prior art, an additional device or an additional drive, which brings about the traversing, at least of the fibre material according to the prior art, can be dispensed with. Additional auxiliary means, which correct the running of the fibre material leaving the drafting arrangement with respect to the spinning unit, are also dispensed with here to allow flush feeding into the latter.<br>
It is provided here that at least the top delivery rollers are arranged in relation to the spinning unit in such a way that the material flow in each case deviates in the same direction from the roller centre.<br><br><br>
The top rollers may preferably be arranged in pairs on a common respective axle which is attached to the pendulum carrier in an easily detachable manner. The top rollers which can be removed from the pendulum carrier are reinserted into the pendulum carrier after a simple pivoting movement through about 180°, so their surface portions which have not been worn are subjected to the fibre flow. Thus the arrangement of the two spinning units in the fibre material flow is such that the spacing from the centre longitudinal axis of the pendulum carrier or from the top roller centre is not equal<br>
A development provides that the top rollers can be detached individually from the common axle. In this manner, the top rollers can be arranged on the opposing side of the common axle so the non-ground-in region of the top roller is subjected to the fibre material flow. As an alternative, the top rollers detached from the axle can also be placed on the same side of the axle again, once they have been turned through 180°. This also allows it to be achieved that the region of the top roller which was not subjected to the material flow until then is subjected to the material flow. For this purpose, the lateral coverings, which protect the top rollers from penetrating fibre material dust, can be fastened in an easily detachable manner to the top rollers. The top rollers are configured accordingly for this, so after the turning of the top roller, the covering can be placed on the opposing side again.<br>
As an alternative, the top rollers can be mounted so as to be easily detachable on the pendulum carrier by means of separate axles. This development allows the top rollers together with the axle to be removed from the pendulum carrier and to be arranged pivoted through 180° on the opposing side.<br>
In a preferred development, fibre band condensers which are connected upstream from the drafting arrangement and/ or interposed and which are arranged flush with the spinning unit in the material flow direction, may be provided at the workstation. These assist the eccentric guidance of the material flow between the top rollers toward the spinning unit. It is thus achieved that the fibre material flow<br><br><br>
is kept flush in a line with the spinning unit so as not to influence the spinning quality. In addition, the condensers limit too great a spread of the fibre material supplied in the drafting arrangement.<br>
According to a development, the fibre band condensers may be arranged on a traversing mechanism, which allows a traversing of the thread material between the roller centre and a roller edge of the top rollers. The traversing width is limited here to a narrow region between the top roller centre and the top roller edge, which is predetermined by the eccentric arrangement. The outlay is limited to the traversing of the interposed fibre band condenser. The influence of the traversing movement on the flush guidance of the fibre material when being supplied to the spinning unit is kept small, so the spinning units can be quickly attached. Compared to the prior art, the traversing mechanism does not need any costly mounting of the fibre band condensers, as the influence owing to deviations in the position of the condensers during the supply of fibre material into the spinning unit is negligible.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1   schematically shows an air spinning machine in a front view;<br>
Fig. 2   shows a drafting arrangement in a side view;<br>
Fig. 3  shows a view from above of a schematically shown drafting arrangement with top rollers arranged on a common axle;<br>
Fig. 4  shows a view from above of a schematically shown drafting arrangement according to Fig. 3 with a traversing mechanism;<br>
Fig. 5   shows a view from above of a schematically shown drafting arrangement with top rollers arranged on separate axles.<br><br><br>
Fig. 1 shows an air spinning machine 1, with the aid of which the invention is described. The invention can equally be transferred to all textile machines which have a spinning unit, upstream from which a drafting arrangement is arranged, for example a ring spinning machine. Textile machines of this type generally have a plurality of workstations 2 arranged next to one another in a row as well as a so-called end frame 13 at at least one end.<br>
As known, each of the workstations or spinning stations 2 of an air spinning machine 1 of this type has a fibre band source, for example a spinning can 3, a drafting arrangement 4, an air spinning device 5, a thread take-off mechanism 6, a yarn clearer 7 as well as a thread traversing mechanism 8. The thread traversing mechanism 8 ensures that the thread produced in the air spinning device 5 is wound onto a take-up bobbin 9 in crossing layers. The cross-wound bobbin 9 is generally held in a creel and is rotated by a bobbin drive.<br>
As further indicated in Fig. 1, the spinning stations 2 of the air spinning machine 1 are supplied by an automatically operating service traveller 10, which, guided on rails 11,12, can be moved along the spinning stations 2.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the drafting arrangements 4 generally have a pair 20 of feed rollers, a pair 21 of central rollers and a pair 23 of delivery rollers, the pairs of rollers in each case consisting of drivable bottom rollers 20A, 21A, 23A as well as top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B held in a pendulum carrier 17. The pendulum carrier 17 is fastened on a holding bar 30 so as to be moveable to a limited extent and can be positioned by means of a lever 29 in three possible positions a) "loaded", b) "unloaded" and c) "folded up". Drawing belts 27, which are guided on deflection rails, are also arranged in the region of the pair 21 of central rollers.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic view from above of the drafting arrangement 4, with the aid of which the arrangement of the components involved in the production process and the material flow resulting therefrom are described.   The bottom rollers 20A,<br><br><br>
21 A, 23A are covered in this view by the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B. The fibre material is supplied to a condenser 33, 33' connected upstream from the drafting arrangement 4 and then advanced to the pair 20 of feed rollers. A further condenser 34, 34' is provided between the pair 20 of feed rollers and the pair 21 of central rollers. The air spinning device 5 adjoins the pair 23 of delivery rollers. The fibre material flow is indicated as a dashed line F in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen here that the fibre material flow F runs between the roller centre of the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B' and one of the top roller edges.<br>
The adjacent air spinning devices 5, 5' have a spacing from one another corresponding to the separation of the drafting arrangement 4. In this case, the arrangement of the air spinning devices 5, 5' is selected such that the spacing of the one air spinning device 5 from the centre longitudinal axis M of the pendulum carrier 17 is greater than the spacing of the adjacent air spinning device 5'. In the same manner, the condensers 33, 33', 34, 34' are arranged to achieve a flush material flow F through the drafting arrangement 4 toward the air spinning devices 5, 5'.<br>
The wear occurring on the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B and 20B', 21B1, 23B1 has the greatest effect on the top rollers 23B, 23B' of the pair 23 of delivery rollers. The fibre material reduced by the drawing to virtually thread diameter produces a groove with a corresponding width on the top rollers 23B, 23B'. As the wear only occurs in the edge regions of the top rollers 23B, 23B' because of the eccentric fibre material guidance, the top rollers 23B, 23B' connected to one another by an axle 14 in each case can be removed together from the pendulum carrier 17 and inserted again rotated through 180°.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further embodiment, in which the condensers 33, 33', 34, 34' are arranged on a traversing mechanism 36, 36'. The traversing mechanism 36, 36' is used to slightly traverse the condensers 33, 33', 34, 34' and therefore the fibre material between the pairs 20, 21, 23 of rollers in the region between the roller centre and a roller edge.  The service lives of the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B'<br><br><br>
can be further extended by the traversing as the traversing leads to a further evening out of the wear of the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B'. For this purpose, the traversing mechanism 36, 36' may be connected, for example, to an eccentric shaft along the length of the machine, which ensures uniform traversing of the condensers 33, 33', 34, 34' transversely to the fibre material flow. The traversing width is selected to be so narrow here that the deviation from the flush supply of the fibre material into the respective air spinning device 5, 5' is so slight that the spinning process is not negatively influenced. At the pair 23 of top delivery rollers, the traversing width is less than half the roller width, but preferably less than 10 mm. The resulting deviation during the introduction of the drawn fibre material into the air spinning device 5, 5' is in the region of a few tenths of millimetres.<br>
It is also conceivable for the drafting arrangement 4 to be configured in such a way that the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B' can be detached from their respective axle 14,14', 14" in order to place them again on the respective axle 14,14', 14" on the opposing side.<br>
As an alternative, a mounting may also be provided in which each top roller 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B1, 21B', 23B1 is mounted on a separate axle 15 as shown schematically in Fig. 5. In this embodiment, the top rollers can be detached from the axles 15 or else the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B, 23B' are detached together with their respective axle 15 from the pendulum carrier 17 and arranged again on the axles 15 or on the pendulum carrier 17 on the opposing side. This arrangement also allows at least the top delivery rollers 23B, 23B1 to be arranged in relation to the spinning units 5 in such a way that the material flow direction F is guided between the roller centre and one of the roller edges.<br>
In all the embodiments described, at least the top delivery rollers 23B, 23B' are arranged in relation to the spinning units 5 in such a way that the material flow F in each case deviates in the same direction from the roller centre. This ensures that, after detachment from the pendulum carrier 17 and the turning of the top rollers<br><br><br>
20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B' or the axles 14,14', 14", 15 together with the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B', 23B' located thereon, the eccentric regions of the top rollers 20B, 21B, 23B, 20B', 21B1, 23B' are always subjected to the material flow F which did not previously come into contact therewith, and were therefore not subjected to any wear.<br><br><br>
