				<td>CYCLONIC AERO POWER CONVERTER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cyclonic aero power converter in other words an<br>
improved wind power generator. More particuiarly the present invention relates to<br>
fixed disc. The fixed disc, promotes efficiently and easy starting at the time of a<br>
low wind speed and also to the wind power equipment is using a wind mill which<br>
can achieve high torque and comply with wind power conditions of an installed<br>
place.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
To generate electricity, hydraulic power, thermal power or atomic power is<br>
utilized, which involves disadvantages such as natural destruction with a dam,<br>
fuel shortage, air pollution and radioactivity injuries. Clean natural energy such as<br>
solar generation and wind power generation has been remarked over the whole<br>
world. As a power generation device for obtaining small electric power, for<br>
instance, a wind power generation attracts attention in view of an advantage that<br>
an environmental contamination does not arise. In a usual wind power generation<br>
device having a propeller provided on a horizontal shaft has been ordinarily<br>
employed. In such a wind power generation device, the propeller needs to be<br>
directed to the direction of wind. A troublesomeness of detecting the wind<br>
direction or a cost for a controller for adjusting the propeller to the wind direction<br>
is inconveniently required.<br>
Generally, with wind power equipment, the wind mill is used as a means to<br>
change a wind force into rotation driving force, a wind mill is rotated with a wind<br>
force, a generator is driven with the rotation driving force, and electrical energy is<br><br>
generated. Since such wind power equipment uses the unsteady force of the<br>
force of a natural wind of what can generate electricity safely compared with<br>
other power plants, such as thermal power station equipment, without having a<br>
bad influence on an environment, a living thing, etc., it is difficult to perform the<br>
generation of electrical energy stabilized efficiently.<br>
Especially the thing that it is stabilized and the wind mill of wind power equipment<br>
is started when a wind speed is low, and is made to generate electricity efficiently<br>
is very difficult. Then, in order to consider as the approach of making easy<br>
starting of the wind mill of the wind power equipment at the time of such a low<br>
wind speed and to acquire rotation driving torque required for stable starting of a<br>
wind mill from before, a radius of circle is given to the profile of a wind mill, and it<br>
is carrying out by the approach of improving flow of the wind to an aerofoil, and<br>
the approach of using as the angle of torsion which obtains rotation driving force<br>
with" an efficient aerofoil according to a wind speed using a pitch inverter.<br>
However, by such starting approach, in order to start the wind-mill device section<br>
directly, there was a problem that the adjustment corresponding to the wind<br>
speed fluctuation in a low wind-speed region was difficult, and difficulty was in<br>
operability.<br>
This invention aims at offering the modern type of advanced technology"s<br>
windmill starting promotion equipment, which can promote efficiently easily<br>
starting by which was made in view of the above situations, and the windmill at<br>
the time of a low wind speed was stabilized.<br>
According to the survey conducted by Vim Tukenburg and his friends of a<br>
university of Netherland, it was clear that our earth has enough wind energy to<br>
fulfill the requirement of earth"s electrical power. Vim Tukenburg distributed the<br>
earth into many thousand units and calculated the amount of wind power in each<br><br>
unit. All the populated areas, prohibited places, mountains and streams were not<br>
included in the survey. The calculations of Mr Tukenburg stated that wind energy<br>
could be converted into electrical energy only when it flows more than the rate of<br>
4m/s. Previous research stated that minimum 7.1m/s of wind flow was necessary<br>
to produce electricity from it. An average 20% of the world"s total area receives<br>
wind energy at the rate more than that of minimum requirement for the<br>
production of electricity. The total of 96 Mega watt /hour can be produced every<br>
year from the energy consumed by the wind energy. The production of the<br>
electricity will be more than that of the normal demand. The survey also tells that<br>
wind energy from 24lakh square km will be enough to fulfill the electricity demand<br>
of the world in the year 2000 very easily. It has been calculated that an area of 1<br>
Sq km, four wind turbines of 1-1 mega watt can be installed. Few places have<br>
even much more than 4 turbines installed in the area of 1 sq km.<br>
Now if we look at the problem, we will see that the survey tells that the wind does<br>
not flow evenly at all places in the globe. For example South Africa has much<br>
more wind power needed for the production of electricity to meet their<br>
requirement and on the other hand wind power in Northwest Asia arrives in a<br>
fluctuating manner. So wind power cannot be taken as the only source of energy.<br>
Whenever the wind energy will fall, we must have another source to produce<br>
electrical power. There is good example of Scandinavia as when the wind flows<br>
sufficiently, the electricity produced is utilized to pump the water at a higher<br>
altitude. On the other hand when the wind energy is not sufficient to produce<br>
electricity, water resource kept at higher altitude is the other way out.<br>
So electricity produced in a huge amount from wind energy will be cheaper than<br>
that of primary method. Lastly if we will utilize wind power by storing, then there<br>
has to be a large amount of changes in the present electrical gadgets.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Now, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, which shows the plan view of the rotator system for wind<br>
wave energy generation. The rotator system for wave energy generation consists<br>
of a windmill starting promotion equipment fixed disc (12) with nose cone (A) about 30°<br>
apex angle, having a frame (1) to hold the fixed structure. It is a frame, which<br>
work to hold the front disc strongly. The fixed structure which is also the windmill<br>
starting promotion unit is having fixed blades situated in the outer part (2). It is<br>
part of the front disc. Front disc"s shape is totally round. The front disc is divided<br>
into many parts in roundly structured wind receiving fixed blades (6).<br>
The wind wave energy generation system also consists of wind receiving rotating<br>
blades (3) fitted over a rotor, which is also the moving structure (11) of the wind<br>
wave energy generation system. It is a 2nd part of the front disc. Front disc is<br>
absolutely round. The movable part is also divided into many parts in specially<br>
designed blades (5) so that the maximum thrust is transferred to the windmill<br>
blades. The following air directly attacks to blades (3), the air pass through full<br>
assemble set of rotating disc (11). The thrust transferred from the directed wind<br>
is utilized in the rotation of the wind wave energy generation system.<br>
The structures to the fixed blade assembly and the rotating blade assembly is so<br>
designed that the flowing air from any direction when attack to blades (2) the<br>
flowing air is directed to pass through it in a particular direction and the maximum<br>
thrust is passed on to the blades (3) of the full assembled set of rotating blades<br>
(11). The thrust is applied continuously by the flowing wind to the moving blades<br>
one after the other. Also it has been seen experimentally that if the number of the<br>
fixed blades of fixed disc made equal to the number of the rotating blades of the<br>
rotating disc the rotating blades can use the maximum thrust continuously. The<br>
circumferential size of the rotor blades is preferably equal or can be more than<br>
the size of the fixed blades. Therefore the present system provides a gainful<br>
utilization of the wind energy irrespective of the direction of the flow of the wind.<br>
The said promotional equipment and the rotor have a plurality of support arms /<br><br>
blades in the radial direction; a heavy circumferential ring is fixed to the outer end<br>
of each of said support arms to construct a flywheel type structure.<br>
The base (4) of the frame (1) is welded to the frame so that the base can hold the<br>
frame strongly. The structures of the frame are made up of strong, non-corrosive,<br>
tough and light weight material preferably the alloys of aluminium. The rotating<br>
disc consumes the most of the energy of the air which is exit / directed from the<br>
fixed disc. The air creates a pressure on the rotating disc"s blade, which creates<br>
a circular movement. The structure of the blades of the rotating disc is nearly<br>
semi circular. When the average linear motion of the blade become half of the<br>
linear motion of the air, then it absorbs nearly all kinetic energy which is present<br>
in air an according to the structure and efficiency of the machine we can get the<br>
kinetic energy to produce electrical energy by dynamo.<br>
The blades (2) of the fixed disc change the direction of the flowing air into<br>
approximately 80 degree to 85 degrees as shown in the figure 6(b) in the<br>
direction of the rotating disc and the fixed blade convert the motion of the coming<br>
air into cyclonic aero when the air exists from it. The air flows at the different<br>
positions are shown in Fig 6 (a), (b).<br>
As per one of the object of the present invention the windmill rotor is horizontally<br>
mounted to a main shaft, said rotor being constructed as flywheel, a plurality of<br>
wind-receiving blades being spaced equally on the circumference of the rotor.<br>
The kinetic energy produced by the movement of the rotor is transmitted forward<br>
through a shaft (7), which is fitted with the rotating disc. The rotating disc is fitted<br>
with the shaft by very well balanced manner to prevent any loss of energy. The<br>
rotating disc is fitted with the shaft with the help of a flange (10). The coupling (8)<br>
is situated at the other side of the shaft to help to move other appliance. Also the<br>
assembly is fitted with a ball bearing (9). The Ball bearing is covered by a double<br>
"Z" and rubber seal for protection because of the presence of dust and moisture<br><br>
in the air. The kinetic energy thus produced is fed to a dynamo (D) for the<br>
production of the energy.<br>
As per another object of the present invention the wind-receiving blades for the<br>
windmill are mounted to a rotor having a shaft as flywheel, wherein said<br>
mounting support is projected in a direction of rotation, the top end of the wind-<br>
receiving portion being fixed forwards to the end of the mounting support.<br>
As shown in figure 4, the distance between the fixed blade assemble an the<br>
rotating blade assembly should be kept minimum so that the maximum amount of<br>
thrust can be transferred to the moving blades. Practically the distance is<br>
maintained less than 3mm for mechanical constraints and it is necessary too.<br>
As per the experiments carried out with the wind energy generation system as<br>
disclosed herein and the 3 blade fan turbines as available the results obtained<br>
are as under:-<br>
The area of the fan blades is taken as 0.126Sq Mtrs.<br><br><br><br>
The ratio of output in terms of watts is 6.571 times compared to the conventional<br>
3-blade fan turbine<br>
The ratio of output in terms of torque is 8.33 times compared to the conventional<br>
3-blade fan turbine<br>
Therefore it may be concluded that the energy generated is more than 6 times in<br>
the same wind conditions and the dimensions of the fan blade.<br>

described with reference to particular embodiments and applications thereof, it<br>
has been presented for purposes of illustration and description and is not<br>
intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the particular embodiments<br>
