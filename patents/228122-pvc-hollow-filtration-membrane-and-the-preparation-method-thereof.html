				<td>PVC HOLLOW FILTRATION MEMBRANE AND<br>
THE PREPARATION METHOD THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane,<br>
especially to a modified polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane having good<br>
permeability and anti-pollution properties.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to the characteristics such as energy conservation, environmental protection and<br>
easy operation o'f the membrane isolation technique, the industry of membrane isolation has<br>
developed rapidly, and the application scope thereof has been extended to the fields such as<br>
biology, medicament, environmental protection, energy sources, municipal water treatment,<br>
and waste water treatment. A hollow filtration membrane, due to its large filtration area per<br>
unit volume, low cost of the manufacture of equipment, and the realization of cross flow<br>
filtration, makes the life time of the filter element greatly extended. However, the current<br>
commercialized hollow filtration membrane products generally utilize materials such as<br>
polysulfones (PS), polyvinylidene fluorides (PVDF), polyethersulfones (PES), and<br>
polyacrylonitriles (PAN), which cannot be widely used due to their low ratios of quality to<br>
price.<br>
Polyvinyl chlorides are attracting more and more attention from research units, as they<br>
have good physical properties and chemical stability, are resistant to microorganism erosion,<br>
acids and bases, and have a lot of sources and varieties, the price of which is low. However,<br>
since the hydrophilicity of polyvinyl chloride materials themselves is not good, polyvinyl<br>
chloride filtration membranes have no good penetration property and are easily polluted, thus<br>
causing the filtration property thereof to decline rapidly.<br>
To produce liquid separation membranes of polyvinyl chloride having excellent<br>
properties, it is necessary to improve the hydrophilicity thereof after the membrane is formed.<br>
To realize it, the following methods may be employed: (1) copolymerization modification, i.e.<br>
introducing other chemical substances having hydrophilic groups into vinyl chloride chain<br>
segments by copolymerization; (2) plasma surface modification, i.e. treating polyvinyl<br>
chloride powders or membranes with plasma to produce hydrophilic groups containing<br>
chlorine on the surfaces of polyvinyl chloride powders or membranes; and (3) surface grafting<br>
modification (one of filtration membrane chemical modification), i.e. making polyvinyl<br>
chloride molecule chain produce free radicals by high energy radiation such as Y-ray and<br>
electron beam, then introducing the desired hydrophilic groups into the membrane surface by<br>
graft polymerization. All of the above three methods can realize the improvement of the<br>
hydrophilicity property of polyvinyl chloride filtration membrane, but their industrialization is<br>
not easy, as the cost is high.<br><br>
The fourth modification method for polyvinyl chloride filtration membrane is called as<br>
co-blend modification, i.e. adding a co-blend material, which is compatible with polyvinyl<br>
chloride materials and has hydrophilic groups, into a slurry for preparing the membrane. The<br>
less the difference of solubility parameters (representing the solubility property of a<br>
macromolecule material) between the two materials is, then the better the compatibility of the<br>
two materials is, the more stable the slurry for preparing the membrane is, the more uniform<br>
the aperture of the formed membrane is, and the less the drawbacks are. Furthermore, the<br>
better the hydrophilicity property of the selected co-blend material is, and the higher the ratio<br>
thereof in the slurry for preparing the membrane is, then the higher the water flux of the<br>
membrane is, and the better the anti-pollution property thereof is. Therefore, the selection of<br>
proper co-blend material and the use of the proper molding technique can produce a polyvinyl<br>
chloride hollow filtration membrane having good mechanical properties, high water flux and<br>
good anti-pollution property, which has a good quality and low cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration<br>
membrane having good penetration property and remarkable anti-pollution property.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a polyvinyl<br>
chloride hollow filtration membrane.<br>
The polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane of the present invention mainly<br>
comprises the following components:<br>
30-95 wt.% of polyvinyl chloride, and<br>
5-70 wt.% of vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer,<br>
wherein the polymerization degree of polyvinyl chloride is from 700 to 2500; the<br>
content of vinyl acetate is 10-19% and the content of maleic anhydride is 18-40% on a basis<br>
of total weight of the terpolymer; and the absolute viscosity of the terpolymer is 1.2-1.9<br>
mPa.s.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for preparing a polyvinyl chloride hollow<br>
filtration membrane, which comprises the following steps:<br>
formulating a spray-membrane slurry having the following components on a basis of<br>
total weight of the slurry:<br>
polyvinyl chloride	5.6-14.1%<br>
vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer	0.4-13.0%<br>
thermal stabilizer	0.1-0.7%<br>
solvent	61.5-85.1%<br>
hole-making agent	1.1-10.4%<br>
wherein the polymerization degree of polyvinyl chloride is from 700 to 2500; the content of<br>
vinyl acetate is 10-19% and the content of maleic anhydride is 18-40% on a basis of total<br>
weight of the terpolymer; and the absolute viscosity of the terpolymer is 1.2-1.9 mPa.s;<br><br>
mixing the polyvinyl chloride, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer,<br>
heat stabilizer and solvent within the above proportion ranges, dissolving the mixture at<br>
40-90Â°C, then adding a hole-making agent therein, dissolving for 10-24 hours with continuous<br>
stirring, and standing for 10-15 hours to form the spray-membrane slurry; and<br>
spraying the membrane by a known method to solidify the membrane, thereby forming<br>
the polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In the polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane of the present invention, the<br>
content of polyvinyl chloride is 30-95 wt.%, preferably 60-80 wt.%, and the content of the<br>
vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer is 5-70 wt.%, preferably 20-40 wt.%.<br>
Said filtration membrane further inevitably contains a trace quantity of residual solvent and<br>
other impurities.	.<br>
In the vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer used in the present<br>
invention, the content of vinyl acetate is 10-19 wt.%, preferably 13-15 wt.%, and the content<br>
of maleic anhydride is 18-40 wt.%, preferably 20-28 wt.%. The terpolymer contains a strong<br>
hydrophilic group (-COOH), which has a water contact angle of 40 degree and a solubility<br>
parameter of 9.5-9.7 (J/cm3)1/2. The solubility parameter of said vinyl chloride-vinyl<br>
acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer is very close to that of the polyvinyl chloride (9.6<br>
(J/cm3)1/2), so the compatibility of these two materials are very good, and can be blended<br>
almost in any ratio.<br>
In the method for preparing the membrane of the present invention, the solvent may be<br>
selected from the group consisting of dimethyl formamide (DMF) or dimethyl acetamide<br>
(DMAC). The thermal stabilizer may be selected from the group consisting of barium stearate,<br>
organotin, and a lead compound, preferably thiolmethyltin. The main function of the stabilizer<br>
is to avoid the thermal degradation of the polyvinyl chloride produced in the process of<br>
formulating and heating the slurry. The hole-making agent can increase the percentage of<br>
open area of the membrane, enhance the penetration property of the membrane, and will be<br>
helpful to improve the toughness thereof. The hole-making agent can be selected from the<br>
group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), preferably<br>
polyethylene glycol (PEG). The slurry for preparing the membrane can be prepared at a<br>
temperature of 40-90Â°C, preferably 50-80Â°C.<br>
The vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer used in the present<br>
invention has good hydrophilicity property, and physical and chemcial properties, and is<br>
compatible with polyvinyl chloride, the cost of which is relatively low. The addition of the<br>
vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer can greatly improve the<br>
hydrophilicity and anti-pollution properties of the formed membrane. For example, when the<br>
weight ratio of vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride terpolymer to polyvinyl chloride<br>
is 3:7, the water contact angle of the filtration membrane is 57 degree, while the water contact<br><br>
angle of the complete polyvinyl chloride filtration membrane is 66 degree.<br>
The spray-membrane slurry of the present invention can be used to spray the membrane<br>
by a known dry jet-wet spinning method, then be solidified in a coagulant to form a<br>
membrane, wherein the coagulant is water or an aqueous solution containing a certain solvent.<br>
Thus, the polyvinyl chloride hollow filtration membrane of the present invention, which has<br>
excellent properties, is prepared.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now the present invention is further detailedly illustrated in combination with the<br>
following examples. However, it is appreciated that these examples are only intended to<br>
illustrate the invention, but not to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A uniform spray-membrane slurry was prepared according to the following procedure:<br>
11.5 wt.% of polyvinyl chloride, 5.0 wt.% of vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride<br>
terpolymer and 0.3 wt.% of thiolmethyltin stabilizer were mixed; then the mixture, together<br>
with 76.3 wt.% of DMAC, were poured into a stirring vessel at a temperature of 78Â°C with the<br>
stirring rotation speed of 110rpm; after they were basically dissolved, 6.9 wt.% of PEG was<br>
added therein; then they were stirred for 10 hours at a constant temperature of 78Â°C, the<br>
vacuum debubbling was performed, and they were stood for 12 hours to form the<br>
spray-membrane slurry. The resulting spray-membrane slurry was extruded through an<br>
spinneret by a dry jet-wet spinning method, then it was passed through a water coagulant to<br>
produce a hollow filtration membrane. The resulting membrane has a retention molecule<br>
weight of 80,000 daltons, and has a pure water filtration yield of 800 L/m2h at a pressure of<br>
0.1 MPa and a water temperature of 25Â°C.<br>

9.4 wt.% of polyvinyl chloride, 3.3 wt.% of vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate-maleic anhydride<br>
terpolymer and 0.2 wt.% of thiolmethyltin stabilizer were mixed; then the mixture, together<br>
with 83.9 wt.% of DMAC, were poured into a stirring vessel at a temperature of 60Â°C with the<br>
stirring rotation speed of 90rpm; after they were basically dissolved, 3.2 wt.% of PEG was<br>
added therein; then they were stirred for 10 hours at a constant temperature of 60Â°C, the<br>
vacuum debubbling was performed, and they were stood for 12 hours toform the<br>
spray-membrane slurry. The resulting spray-membrane slurry was extruded through an<br>
