				<td>IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATIMG TO COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS<br><br>
The present invention relates to a solid, cosmetic depilatory composition and a shaving apparatus comprising the solid composition.<br><br>
Various methods for removing hair from dermal surfaces are known. For example, hair may be removed from the skin using a depilatory composition. Such compositions typically take the form of creams or lotions and contain a depilatory active that is capable of degrading hair keratin. ,<br><br>
In an alternative method, hair is removed from dermal surfaces using a razor. In a typical shaving method, the razor is moved across the surface of the skin; hair on the skin's surface is cut as it comes into contact with the razor blade (s) . Optionally, a shaving aid, such as shaving cream, may be applied to the skin prior to shaving.<br><br>
Although shaving provides an effective method of hair removal, the hair that is cut using a razor blade tends to have a hard and bristly appearance. It is therefore among the objects of the embodiments of the present invention to develop a composition that can be used to provide hair with an improved appearance, for example, after cutting.<br><br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a substantially solid cosmetic composition including a soap and/or a non-soap surfactant, and a hair modification active. <br><br>
The cosmetic composition is preferably a hair modification composition.<br><br>
In this application, the term "solid" covers bodies that retain their shape without support at room temperature. The term does not cover flowable compositions, such as lotions, pastes and creams."<br><br>
In this application the term hair modification covers both depilation (whereby the keratin present in hair is substantially broken down therefore effecting removal of the hair) and hair regrowth inhibition whereby an active is applied to a hair shaft or follicle thereby substantially reducing the hair regrowth. Hair modification is not intended to cover change the colour of hair by, for example, dying.<br><br>
The hair modification active may be a depilatory active or an active which substantially inhibits the regrowth of hair (commonly known as a hair regrowth inhibitor or hair regrowth inhibition active) .<br><br>
The solid composition may be applied onto the skin like a conventional soap. For example, the solid composition may be applied onto the skin in the presence of water.<br><br>
Typically, at least a portion of the solid depilatory composition dissolves in water, for example, to form a lather.<br><br>
The present invention further provides a method of modifying hair comprising: <br><br>
applying the substantially solid cosmetic composition substantially as described hereinbefore onto the skin, optionally, in the presence of water; permitting the composition to remain on the skin.<br><br>
It is envisaged that when the hair modification composition is for use as a depilatory composition the composition remains on the skin for a residence time which is sufficient to degrade hairs on the skin.<br><br>
The composition may be removed from the skin, together with depilated hair at the end of the residence time.<br><br>
Preferably the residence time is less than 15 minutes, more preferably not more than 10 minutes, even more preferably not more than 8 minutes . Preferably the residence time is at least 1 second, more preferably at least 30 seconds, even more preferably at least 1 minute. Very suitably the residence time is to 2 to 6 minutes, about 3 to 5 minutes being especially preferred.<br><br>
However, it is envisaged that when the composition is for use as a hair regrowth inhibitor the composition may remain on the skin indefinitely.<br><br>
A further aspect of the invention provides a method of substantially reducing hair regrowth which method includes : applying the solid composition substantially as described hereinbefore, to an area of skin to be treated, optionally in the presence of water, leaving the composition on the skin for a residence time sufficient to substantially inhibit hair regrowth. <br><br>
It is envisaged that the composition may be rinsed from the skin or allowed to remain on the skin indefinitely.<br><br>
The composition may be removed from the skin by any means, for example using a sponge, spatula or scraper device.<br><br>
The composition may also be removed by rinsing. However, it is also envisaged that the composition may remain on the skin indefinitely thereby not requiring rinsing. If rinsing or removal of the composition is not required it is particularly preferred that the pH of the composition is adjusted (such as to a pH in the range 4-8) so as to reduce irritation of the user.<br><br>
Preferably, the composition includes at least one skin enhancing active. The skin enhancing active is preferably a compound which is typically used in skin care products. Such agents may reduce wrinkles, acne scarring, substantially reduce in-growing hairs, and/or chemically exfoliating the skin.<br><br>
The at least one skin enhancing active is preferably a chemical exfoliating active such as an alpha hydroxyl acids (AEiAs) , such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, trichloracetic acid, or a Polyhydroxyacid (PHA) , such as gluconalactone.<br><br>
The chemical exfoliating active is typically present in an amount in the range 0.05 to 3.0 % by weight of the composition, preferably 0.1 to 2.0% by weight of the composition, such as 0.5 to 1.5% by weight. <br><br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a substantially solid cosmetic composition including: a soap and/or a non-soap surfactant, and at least one skin enhancing active.<br><br>
The cosmetic composition is preferably a skin enhancing composition.<br><br>
The skin enhancing active is preferably a compound chemical exfoliating agent substantially as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
It is particularly preferred that the composition includes a hair modification active. The hair modification active is substantially as described hereinbefore .<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention further extends to a method of enhancing mammalian skin, which method includes: applying a solid composition including a soap and/or non soap surfactant and a skin enhancing active, to the' skin to be treated, optionally in the presence of water, leaving the composition on the skin for a predetermined time.<br><br>
It is, of course, envisaged that the composition may be left in contact with the skin indefinitely.<br><br>
As described above, the cosmetic compositions of the present invention may comprise soap. Preferably, soap is present in the solid hair modifying composition, optionally together with a non-soap surfactant. Suitable soaps are described in WO 96/32922 and WO 03/009823. <br><br>
Suitable soaps include alkali metal (e.g. lithium, sodium or potassium), amine (e.g. alkanolamine) or ammonium salts of alkanoic or alkenoic acids having about 6 to 50 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 12 to 20 carbon atoms. A mixture of two or more soaps may be employed.<br><br>
The soap may be a salt of a fatty acid or a mixture of fatty acids . The fatty acid may be an animal or plant fatty acid. The fatty acid may be saturated, unsaturated and/or functionally substituted. The carbon chain length of the fatty acid may be selected to provide the soap with desired properties. Where a mixture of fatty acids is used, the carbon chain length of the fatty acids in the mixture may be selected to provide the soap with desired properties.<br><br>
The soap may be made by any suitable method, for example, by direct saponification, optionally, in the presence of an alcohol. Natural fats and oils, such as tallow, fish oil, lard, grease, olive oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, canola oil, castor oil (optionally, acetylated and/or hydrogenated) , corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, coconut oil, rice bran oil, neem oil, babassu oil, tall oil, sal oil, mowrah oil and/or karauja oil, may be saponified using procedures that are well known in the art. Mixtures of two or more oils may be used in the saponification reaction.<br><br>
The soaps may be made by neutralising fatty acids (see above) with an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate. Suitable hydroxides and carbonates include hydroxides and carbonates of lithium, sodium and potassium. Amines, <br><br>
such as alkanolamines may also be used in the neutralisation reaction. Examples include monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine. Fatty acids present in the fats and oils mentioned above may be used in the neutralisation reaction. Specific examples include lauric (C12) acid, myristic (C14) acid, palmitic (Cxβ) acid and/or stearic (Cig) acid. Palm fatty acids and palm kernel fatty acids may also be employed.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the soaps may be made by neutralising a mixture of two or more fatty acids . The carbon chain length of each fatty acid in the mixture may be selected to provide the soap with particular characteristics. In one embodiment, a mixture of palm fatty acids and palm kernel fatty acids may be neutralised with an alkali metal hydroxide (e.g. sodium hydroxide) . The mixture may include 60 to 90 %, for example 80 %, palm fatty acid and 10 to 30 %, for example 20%, palm kernel fatty acid.<br><br>
Examples of suitable soaps that may be used include sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate, sodium laurate, sodium stearate (e.g. sodium iso-stearate) and sodium cocoate. Mixtures of such soaps may be employed.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the soap comprises a sodium salt of distilled palm and lauric fatty acids. Specifically, the soap comprises a sodium salt of distilled 80% palm and 20% palm kernel fatty acids.<br><br>
The soap may include other components conventionally present in soap compositions. Such components include unreacted fatty acid(s) , chelating agents, such as tetra- sodium EDTA, and surfactants. Skin conditioning agents, such as glycerine (e.g. glycerine soaps) , may also be <br><br>
present. Additives, such as crystallization retardants, may also be present.<br><br>
Examples of suitable soaps include soaps sold under the PRISAVON™ trademark or the soap sold as PT Muslim SlOOO soap noodles. The soap may be opaque or translucent.<br><br>
As an alternative or in addition to the soap, a non-soap surfactant may be employed. Preferably, the non-soap surfactant is employed in addition to the soap. The non- soap surfactant may be a solid or a liquid. Suitable surfactants include cationic, anionic and/or non-ionic surfactants . Preferably, an anionic surfactant is employed. Suitable anionic surfactants include sodium cocoyl isethionate and sarcosinates , such as sodium lauryl sarcosinate. Mixtures of surfactants may be used. For example, in one embodiment, sodium cocoyl isethionate and sarcosinates are present in the solid depilatory composition. In an alternative embodiment, however, non- soap surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, are excluded from the composition.<br><br>
The composition according to the present invention may comprise 40 to up to 99 weight %, preferably 45 to 98 weight %, more preferably 50 to 95 weight % soap and/or non-soap surfactant. It is, of course, envisaged that the composition may include more than one soap and/or non-soap surfactant.<br><br>
In one aspect, the amount of soap and/or non-soap surfactant ranges from 80 to 93 weight %. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of soap and/or non-soap surfactant is from 85 to 91 weight %. <br><br>
In a second aspect the composition includes at least one&gt; soap and at least one non-soap surfactant. Preferably, the combined weight of the soap and non-soap surfactant is 40 to 93 weight %, preferably 45 to 85 weight %, further preferably 55 to 75 weight %.<br><br>
Where soap and non-soap surfactant (s) are present in the composition, the ratio of soap to non-soap surfactant (s) may be 100:1 to 1:100, preferably 20:1 to 1:20, more preferably 10:1 to 1:10, even more preferably 8:1 to 1:8, yet more preferably 4:1 to 1:4, for example 3:1 to 1:3. In one embodiment, the ratio of soap to non-soap surfactant is 2.5:1.<br><br>
It is believed that many hair modification actives may have both depilatory and hair re-growth inhibition properties . It is further believed that the amount of hair modification active present and/or the pH in the hair modification composition determines whether the composition acts as a hair re-growth inhibition composition or a depilatory composition.<br><br>
Accordingly, the composition when containing a hair modification active, may act as a depilatory composition or a hair re-growth inhibition composition. The hair modification active may therefore be selected from, but not restricted to a sulphur compound, such as potassium thioglycolate, sodium thioglycolate, ammonium thioglycolate, dithioetythritol, thioglycerol, thioglycol, thioxanthine, thipsalicylcic acid, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, lipic acid, NaHSO3, Li2S, Na2S, K2S, MgS, CaS, SrS, BaS, (NH1J)2S, sodium dihydrolipoate 6, 8-dithiooctanoate, sodium 6, 8-dithiooctanoate, salts of hydrogen sulphide (e.g. NaSH or KSH), thioglycolic acid, thioglycerol, 2- <br><br>

It is, of course, envisaged that blends of more than one hair modification active may be used.<br><br>
Preferred hair modification actives are thioglycolates, or their precursor thioglycolic acid; glycerol monothioglycolate, cysteamine, acetyl cysteine (N-acetyl- L-Cysteine) and BBI-AV An example of a suitable thioglycolate is potassium thioglycolate, which may be produced by mixing thioglycolic acid with a neutralising source of potassium hydroxide. <br><br>
The composition may comprise 0.01 to 30 weight %, preferably 0.05 to 20 weight %, more preferably 0.1 to 10 weight % of the hair modification active. In one embodiment, from 0.2 to 8 weight % depilatory active is present. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of depilatory active is 1 to 7 weight %, preferably 2 to 6 weight % .<br><br>
It is particularly preferred that the composition includes at least one silicone and/or mineral oil.<br><br>
The silicone is typically present in an amount greater than 5 % by weight of the composition. Preferably, the silicone is present in an amount greater than 7 % by weight of composition, further preferably greater than 10% by weight of the composition. It is particularly preferred that the silicone is present in an amount greater than 12.5% by weight of the composition, such as greater than 17.5% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
The silicone is typically present in an amount no more than 75% by weight of the composition. Preferably, the silicone is present in an amount no more than 65% by weight of the composition, further preferably no more than 55% by weight of the composition, such as less than 45% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is further provided a cosmetic composition comprising a soap and/or non-soap surfactant, and a silicone or mineral oil present in an amount greater than 5% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
The silicone is typically present in an amount greater than 7.5 % by weight of the composition. Preferably, the <br><br>
silicone is present in an amount greater than 10 % by weight of composition, further preferably greater than 12.5% by weight of the composition. It is particularly preferred that the silicone is present in an amount greater than 15% by weight of the composition, such as greater than 17.5% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
The cosmetic composition may be a hair modification composition which will include a hair modification active substantially as described hereinbefore. Alternatively, the composition may be a skin enhancing composition which includes a skin enhancing active substantially as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
Cosmetic compositions containing soap and/or a non-soap surfactant together with silicone and/or mineral oil in an amount less than 5% by weight of the composition typically leave the skin feeling dry and/or dehydrated and are therefore not favoured by many users . Surprisingly, it has been found that by substantially increasing the amount of silicone present in a composition improves the feel of the composition on the skin. 'Furthermore, addition of higher levels of silicon and/or mineral oil increases the life time of the final composition as well as improving the hardness and durability of the composition. In addition, such cosmetic compositions are easier to transport as they are less prone to damage which affects both the aesthetic appeal of the cosmetic composition and possibly it's effectiveness .<br><br>
The one or more silicone may be selected from C30-45 Alkyl Methicone and C30-45 Olefin, stearyl dimethicone, lauryl PEG/PPG - 18/18 methicone, bis-hydroxyethoxypropyl <br><br>

It is particularly preferred that the composition includes two or more silicone. Each silicone is selected for its properties which it imparts on the hair modification composition. For example, one or more silicone may provide body, hardness and structural integrity to the product. Alternatively, the one or more silicone may make the hair modification composition softer, improve the ease of spreading on the skin, reduces tackiness and/or provide a moisturising effect. Advantageously, when two or more silicone rubbers are included in the composition, each silicone rubber may provide a different physical property.<br><br>

More preferably, the amount of lathering agent is from 0.1 to 10 weight %, for example, 0.5 to 5 weight %. In one embodiment, the lathering agent is present in an amount of 1 to 3 weight %. Suitable lathering agents include surfactants (e.g. dodecylbenzene sulfonate (DBS) and linear alkylaryl sulfonate (LAS)), glycerol, fatty acids and sugar. Preferably, glycerol is employed, for example, in an amount of 0.5 to 10 weight %, more preferably 0.5 to 1.5 weight % of the composition.<br><br>
The solid composition of the present invention may additionally include a skin conditioning agent. The skin conditioning agent may act as a moisturiser and/or humectant. Suitable skin conditioning agents include allantoin, shea butter, cocoa butter, goa butter, kukui nut oil, coconut oil, castor oil, palm oil, olive oil, avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, sweet almond oil and <br><br>

The solid composition may be made, for example, by first mixing soap noodles until pliable. The remaining components of the composition may then be added to the soap mixture. Mixing is preferably continued until all components are evenly blended. Mixing may be carried out in more than one stages, for example, by passing the mixture through a mill more than once.<br><br>
Once the components are evenly mixed, the mixture may be moulded, for example, by extrusion moulding. The moulding step may be carried out at a temperature of 20 to 8O0C, preferably 30 to 500C, for example 400C.<br><br>
The mixture may optionally be subjected to a reduced pressure or vacuum prior to the moulding step to reduce the risk of formation of air bubbles on the surface of the solid hair modification composition.<br><br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing a composition comprising a soap and/or a non-surfactant and at least one silicone and/or mineral oil, the method comprising : a) heating a mixture of soap and/or non-soap surfactant to a temperature in the range of 75°C to 85°C; b) blending the soap and/or non-soap surfactant with at least one silicone and/or mineral oil at a temperature in the range of 750C to 850C; and c) milling the blend obtained in b) so as to form soap ribbons .<br><br>
Preferably the one or more silicones are pre-blended prior to step b) . <br><br>
The compositions of the present invention may be employed as a shaving aid. For example, the compositions of the present invention may be applied to the surface of the skin prior to or, preferably, after shaving. The composition may be wet with water before being contacted with the skin. Alternatively or additionally, the composition may be applied to wet skin. As mentioned above, at least a portion of the composition typically dissolves in water, optionally, to form a lather.<br><br>
The composition may be housed in or adjacent the shaving head of a razor and at least partially released when the shaving head comes into contact with, for example, a moist dermal surface.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head and having arranged thereon a substantially solid hair modification composition. The hair modification composition typically includes a soap and/or non-soap surfactant. The composition is preferably substantially as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
According to yet further aspect of the present invention there is provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head and the solid hair modification composition substantially as described above. At least a portion of the solid hair modification composition is desirably configured to directly contact the skin when the shaving apparatus is in use.<br><br>
There is further provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head and having arranged thereon a substantially solid skin enhancing composition. The skin enhancing composition typically includes a soap and/or non-soap <br><br>
surfactant. The composition is substantially as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
According to still yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head having arranged thereon a substantially solid composition, wherein the composition includes a soap and/or a non soap surfactant, and at least one silicone and/or mineral oil. At least a portion of the substantially solid composition is configured to directly contact the skin when the shaving apparatus is in use. Optionally the composition according to this aspect of the present invention includes a hair modification active and/or skin enhancing active substantially as described hereinbefore.<br><br>
According to still yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head having arranged thereon a substantially solid composition, wherein the composition includes a soap and/or a non soap surfactant, and at least one hair modification active.

According to still yet a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a shaving apparatus including a shaving head having arranged thereon a substantially solid composition, wherein the composition includes a soap and/or a non soap surfactant, and at least one skin enhancing active. At least a portion of the substantially solid composition is configured to directly contact the skin when the shaving apparatus is in use. <br><br>
Alternatively or additionally, some of the solid composition may partially dissolve in water and the resulting solution containing dissolved composition may contact the skin. This solution may help to reduce drag effect which may occur between the shaving apparatus and the skin when the shaving apparatus is in use. It is, however, envisaged that the solid hair modification composition, prior to dissolution in water, may also help to reduce drag effect which may occur between a shaving apparatus and skin when the shaving apparatus is in use.<br><br>
By applying the solid composition, when it contains a hair modification active onto the skin, the composition may act on the freshly cut hairs to provide the hairs with a more rounded and/or soft appearance. Providing the hairs with a more rounded and/or soft appearance is particularly advantageous as resultant hair re-growth may be substantially more aesthetically pleasing to the user of the shaver apparatus according to the present invention.<br><br>
Alternatively, the composition may advantageously substantially degrade the hair or substantially reduce hair re-growth.<br><br>
The shaving apparatus typically includes a handle which may be releasably connectible to the head. It is, however, envisaged that the handle may be permanently fixed to the head.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the shaving head includes one or more blades, wherein the composition is positioned adjacent the one or more blades. The composition may be <br><br>
present in or form a glide or lubrication strip, arranged as part of the shaving apparatus .<br><br>
The shaving apparatus may be contacted with water before use, for example, to moisten the solid composition.<br><br>
Alternatively or additionally, the shaving apparatus may be used on pre-moistened skin. Once the shaving operation is complete, the skin may be rinsed with water.<br><br>
Advantageously, the composition is positioned substantially adjacent one or more blades on the shaving head.<br><br>
It is particularly preferred that the shaving head includes a blade pack housing arranged to house the at least one blade, and a soap box housing arranged to house the composition.<br><br>
The composition may be in the form of a bar which is arranged on the blade pack housing. However it is also envisaged that the composition is housed in or on a soap box housing, wherein the soap box housing is substantially adjacent and linked to the blade pack housing. According to a particularly preferred embodiment the soap box housing is pivotally connected to or hinged to, the blade pack housing.<br><br>
