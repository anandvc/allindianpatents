TUBING CUTTER<br>
EMERSON ELECTRIC CO.<br>
U. S. Company<br>
of 8000 West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136, USA<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to tubing cutter.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application relates to the art of cutting devices and, more particularly, to improvements in tools for cutting workpieces having a circular cross section such as tubing. Although the preferred embodiment will be described in connection with a manual tubing cutter apparatus for cutting plastic tubes by hand, it is to be appreciated that the invention has application in other areas including devices for cutting, clipping, or otherwise applying a force to associated workpieces.<br>
A wide variety of tubing cutters has been provided heretofore for cutting plastic tubing of the character used in commercial and domestic water systems, such as schedule 40 PVC tubing, for example. Such cutters have included scissors-type cutters such as that shown in patent 6,513,245 to Aubriot and patent 6,658,738 to King wherein a tube to be cut is supported in a cradle portion of the cutter and a blade is displaceable about a fixed pivot axis to cut a tube interposed between the cradle and blade. In the King patent, the pivot axis is adjustable to accommodate the cuffing of tubes of different diameter.<br>
The scissors-type cutters which require a squeezing action of the handles requires an excessive effort on the part of the user to achieve a cutting operation, especially with larger diameter tubing. Partly in this respect, these tools require the user to rock or rotate the tube and cutter in opposite directions while squeezing the handles to apply a cutting load. Furthermore, with initially cutting through a larger diameter tube, a user who has a small<br>
2<br><br>
hand span has difficulty in applying the necessary closing force on the handles to achieve initial cutting of the tube and, often, has to grasp the handles with both hands to initiate cutting.<br>
Another type of tubing cutter heretofore available includes a cradle for supporting a tube to be cut and a pivotal cutting jaw or blade which is intermittently displaced toward the cradle by means of a ratchet mechanism. While the ratchet mechanism allows a smaller stroke of the cutter handles relative to one another for each intermittent cut, whereby a user can operate the cutter without a large hand span, the cutters are structurally complex and a cutting operation requires a number of sequential displacements of the ratchet handle relative to the cutting head to complete a cutting operation, especially with respect to larger diameter tubes. Accordingly, more work and time is required than is desirable.<br>
In addition to such tubing cutters, a number of metal shears and pruning devices have been provided in which manipulation of the handles of the cutters provide for a slicing displacement of a cutter blade relative to an anvil surface or the like against which an object is pressed during the cutting operation. Such shears are shown, for example, in patents 2,508,790 to Herr, 2,528,816 to Boyer, and 2,564,154 to Compton. These cutting devices are characterized by a pair of handles pivotally interconnected with one another, a cutter blade pivotally attached to one of the handles and a mechanism such as a pin and slot arrangement between the blade and the other handle by which the blade is displaced in a shearing and slicing motion in response to closure of the handles relative to one another. The angular blade travel during cutting with shears of this character is less than the angular displacement required to close the handles relative to one another, whereby the diameter of an object to<br>
3<br><br>
be cut is limited in order to provide for a user to grasp and close the handles with just one hand. Further, cutting is achieved by a combination of shearing and slicing motions, whereby the force required on the handles to achieve cutting is very uniform throughout the cutting stroke.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br>
In accordance with the present application, an improved tubing cutter is provided, especially for plastic tubing of the type mentioned above, which advantageously enables the single stroke of large diameter tubing, such as A-318 inch tubing for example, with less force than heretofore required with regard to closing the handles of the cutter to achieve the cutting operation. More particularly in this respect, the cutter is characterized by a first handle having a cradle for supporting a tube to be cut, a second handle pivotally attached to the first handle, a cutter blade attached to the second handle for displacement therewith and relative thereto, arid a pin and slot interengagement between the cutter blade and the first handle by which the angular displacement of the cutter blade from an open to a closed position relative to the cradle is greater than the angular displacement of the handles to achieve such blade displacement. Accordingly, a longer cutting stroke is achieved with a given handle displacement than heretofore possible, thus enabling the cutting of large diameter tubing with a single stroke, one hand manipulation of the cutters by a user.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the application, an improved tubing cutter is provided, especially for plastic tubing of the type mentioned above, which advantageously provides a mechanical advantage to users of the tubing cutter. In this aspect of the application, the slot configuration provides for displacement of the blade relative to the cradle to initially apply a higher<br>
4<br><br>
cutting force which is followed by a transition to a lower cutting force and a higher rate of blade displacement. Accordingly, a user can grasp the open handles of the cutters closer to the pivot axis between the handles to promote a better gripping of the handles and then, when the cutting stroke is in progress, the user can grasp the handles closer to the outer ends thereof and apply the same cutting force as was initially applied with the hands close to the pivot axis. In this respect, as the transition takes place to the lesser cutting force the user's grasping of the handles adjacent the outer ends thereof increases the leverage and thus enables obtaining the initial force in completing the cutting operation.<br>
It is accordingly an overarching object of the present application to provide an improved tubing cutter, especially for plastic tubing.<br>
Another object is the provision of an improved tubing cutter of the character having a pair of handles pivotally interconnected with one another and a blade pivotally attached to one of the handles and interconnected with the other for displacement of the handles from an open to a closed position to pivotally displace the blade from an open to a closed position relative to a tube being cut.<br>
Yet another object is the provision of a tubing cutter of the foregoing character in which the angular displacement of the blade from the open to the closed position is greater than the angular displacement of the handles from the open to the closed position.<br>
5<br><br>
A further object is the provision of a tubing cutter of the foregoing character which provides for single stroke cutting of tubing to be achieved with less physical effort than heretofore required on the part of a user.<br>
still another object is the provision Of a tubing cutter of the foregoing<br><br>
 followed by lower leverage and a higher cutting rate as the cutting operation is completed.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring now in greater detail to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating preferred embodiment of the present invention and not for the purpose of limiting the invention, Figure 1 provides a perspective view of the subject tubing cutter apparatus 10 in a partially opened position and Figure 2 is an exploded perspective view illustrating the various preferred components thereof and their preferred arrangement in the subject tool.<br>
As shown in those Figures, the preferred form of the tubing cutter 10 comprises a first elongate member 12 pivotally attached at a handle axis 14 with a second elongate member 16, and a cutter blade 20 pivotally attached at a blade axis 22 with the second elongate member 16 as shown. In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the first elongate member 12 is defined by handle halves 12a and 12b, each of which has a first end 24 and an opposite second end 26. Ends 24 are provided with corresponding arcuate cradle portions 30 which, when the cutter is assembled, provide a cradle area for supporting a tube to be cut. The opposite ends 26 of the first elongate member 12 are provided with first handle portions 28 used for gripping the cutter tool 10 during use thereof. Somewhat centrally located in the first elongate member 12 is provided a first guide portion 32 for guiding movement of the cutter blade 20 relative to the first and second elongate members 12, 16 in a manner to be described in greater detail below to provide an increased cutting range, enhanced mechanical advantage, and other benefits.<br>
In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the cutter tool 10 includes a second elongate member 16 pivotally mounted to the first elongate member 12 by a pin 40 having opposite ends received in a pin support 42 in each of the handle halves 12a, 12b, only one of which is visible in Figure 2, whereby the second<br>
7<br><br>
elongate member 16 and the pivot pin 40 are captured between the assembled handle halves 12a, 12b. Overall, the second elongate member 16 includes first and second ends 44, 46, the first end 44 being pivotally attached with the first elongate member 12 at the handle axis 14 and the second free end 46 defines a second handle portion 48 of the tool. The second handle portion is configured to complement the first handle portion 28 the pair and together are useful for gripping and operating the subject cutter tool 10 by hand.<br>
The cutter tool 10 further includes a cutter blade 20 pivotally mounted on the second elongate member 16 by means of a blade pivot pin 50 which extends through a blade pin opening 52 in the cutter blade 20. The blade pivot pin 50 has opposite ends received in a pin support pair 54 formed of the second elongate member 16, only one of which is visible in Figure 2. In this manner, the cutter blade 20 is movable about the blade pivot pin 50 in a blade axis 22 substantially aligned in parallel with the handle axis 14. It is to be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the cutter blade 20 is pivotally movable in a plane extending perpendicular with each of the handle and cutter blade axes 14, 22.<br>
With particular reference now to Figure 3, showing the cutter blade 20 removed from the first and second elongate members 12, 16, the blade pin opening 52 is formed on a first end 60 of the cutter blade and a cutting edge 62 is formed on a second end 64 of the cutter blade opposite the first end 60. In addition, a second guide portion 66 is provided on the cutter blade between the first and second ends 60, 64 as illustrated. The second guide portion 66 is operative with the first guide portion 32 provided on the first elongate member 12 to effect the desired movement of the cutter blade 20 relative to the first and second members 12, 16 during use of the tool. In its preferred form, the<br>
8<br><br>
second guide portion 66 defines an elongate cam slot 70 receiving a cam follower which in the present embodiment is in the form of a pin 72 and roller 74. The pin 72 has opposite ends received in pin recesses 76 formed in the handle halves 12a, 12b, only one of which is visible in Figure 2, whereby the follower and thus cutter blade 20 are captured between the assembled handle halves. A torsion spring 78 is mounted between the handle halves 12a, 12b coaxial with the cam follower and has opposite ends respectively interengaging the first and second handles to bias the handles toward an open position relative to one another. The cam slot 70 has a predetermined shape and is defined between spaced apart elongate side walls 80, 82 extending between spaced apart end walls 84, 86. In its preferred form, the cam slot 70 is generally L-shaped as shown, but can take on any shape including a generally straight slot, a crescent, an arc, multiple connected arcs, or any other regular or irregularly selected shape to realize the benefits of the subject tool as described above. It is to be appreciated that the shape of the slot is based in part on the dimensions of other components of the subject tool.<br>
As shown schematically in Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c, the cutter blade 20 is pivotable relative to the second elongate member 16 about the blade axis 22 in a manner described above. Essentially, the cutter blade 20 is pushed forward into the cavity 90 forming a work area as the second elongate member 16 is closed toward the first elongate member 12 through interaction of the blade pivot pin 50 urging the cutter blade 20 forward. Simultaneous with pivotal movement of the blade relative to the second elongate member, the first and second guide portions 32, 66 mutually cooperate to urge the second end 64 of the cutter blade carrying the cutting edge through arcuate movement in the cavity region 90. More particularly, the preferred tubing cutting is configured to enable pivotal movement between the first and second elongate members<br>
9<br><br>
12, 16 about the handle axis 12 through a first angle Φ1 between an open position as illustrated in Figure 4a whereat the first and second handle portions 28, 48 are in a fully spaced apart position and a fully closed position as illustrated in Figure 4c whereat the first and second handle portions 28, 48 are in close alignment. Figure 4b illustrates an intermediate handle position between the fully opened position shown in Figure 4a and the fully closed position shown in Figure 4c. In the preferred embodiment of the hand tool illustrated, the first angle Oi is about 85.5 degrees.<br>
Together with movement of the handle portions through the first angle as described above, the cutter blade is rotated and moved forward into the cavity area 90 for cutting an associated tube disposed in the cradle portion 30. Initially, the cutter blade 20 is disposed in a retracted position whereat the cutting edge 62 of the cutter blade 20 is spaced from the cradle portion 30 of the first elongate member 12. The cutter blade, however, is pivotally movable about the blade axis 22 through a second angle Φ2 between the retracted position illustrated in Figure 4a and an extended position illustrated in Figure 4c whereat the cutting edge 62 is brought through the cradle portion and cavity 90. In its preferred form, the second angle is about 91.3 degrees.<br>
In addition to the above, it is important to note that the subject tool 10 provides an enhanced mechanical advantage in a first portion X of the second angle between the retracted position and the extended position and a area of lower mechanical advantage Y in a substantially extended region of cutter blade movement A transition between a higher mechanical advantage and a lower mechanical advantage of the cutter blade occurs at approximately mid travel of the cutter blade through the cavity 90. Essentially, the ratio of blade<br>
10<br><br>
travel to handle travel is constantly changing throughout the entire handle advancement. The total blade travel is greater than the total handle travel overall as described above. Preferably, for every degree of handle advancement in a closed direction, the blade advancement is different permitting the cutting of a larger size tube with a smaller hand span than would be possible with a standard scissors cutter. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, for every five degrees of incremental handle travel, the blade rotational movement is between about 8.2 degrees and about 4.4 degrees of movement. A chart identifying respective handle and blade movement is provided below.<br><br>

As noted above, it is to be appreciated that the subject cutter tool provides an optimized mechanical advantage to users of the tool in cutting plastic pipe. More particularly, a mechanical advantage MA is provided relative to an applied force FA applied equally and oppositely against the handle portions 28, 48 of the first and second elongate members 12, 16 in turn effecting a compressive force Fc by the cutting edge 62 of the cutter blade 20 on an associated circular workpiece such as a plastic pipe. Figure 5 shows a free body diagram layered upon a cross-sectional view of the mechanical linkages forming the subject cutter tool 10. As illustrated, an applied force FA is applied at a distance E from the handle axis 14. With the first elongate member 12 held fixed, the applied force FA moves the second elongate member 16 from the opened position shown in Figure 4a to a closed position shown in Figure 4c to effect a cutting of the associated circular workpiece 100.<br>
As noted above, pivotal movement of the handle portion 28 of the second elongate member 16 about the handle axis 14 urges the cutter blade 20 forward through the first and second guide portions 32, 66 formed in the first elongate member 12 and in the cutter blade 20, respectively. Also, pivotal movement of the cutter blade is effected during movement of the second elongate member 16. As shown in Figure 5, the roller 74 carried on the pin 72 in the first guide portion 32 creates a counteractive loading force FL against the first side wall 80 of the cam slot 70 in reaction to the cutting force Fc applied to the workpiece 100. As those of ordinary skill in the art would understand, both the loading force FL as well as the cutting force Fc are generated in directions normal to their respective load surfaces. In the case of the loading force FL, the force is applied against the first side wall 80 in a direction normal to a surface thereof. Similarly, the cutting force Fc is applied to the associated workpiece 100 in a direction normal to a surface thereof.<br>
12<br><br>
Overall, a mechanical advantage MA is provided in the subject cutter tool 10 during the initial portions of a cutting stroke through a workpiece illustrated at X in Figure 4a. For purposes of illustrating an advantage of a preferred embodiment of the subject cutter tool, Figure 6 shows a mechanical advantage graph realized by the subject tool while cutting an associated workpiece in the form of a standard plastic pipe having a one inch (1") nominal outer diameter (actual O.D. is 1.315 inches). As illustrated there, the mechanical advantage is at its greatest when the handles of the cutter tool are in an opened position to enable the user to grip the tool and more easily squeeze and cut the workpiece with an opened hand. This occurs with the handles being operated between about 90° and about 70°. Typically of course, users have more hand strength as the hand is more fully closed rather than in an opened position. The subject tool compensates for the decreased mechanical advantage in the hand in an opened position by providing additional mechanical advantage during that phase of the operation. As the user's hand is closed, however, the mechanical advantage realized in the first portion of tool operation is diminished slightly but is easily overcome by the user's strength. This occurs with the handles being operated about 70° and about 35°.<br>
With reference once again to Figure 5, the mechanical advantage provided by the tool is based upon dimensions and the geometry of the tool and the shape of the slot 70 formed by the cutter blade 20. In Figure 5, the blade axis 22 is spaced from the cutting force Fc in a direction perpendicular to the cutting force Fc by a first distance A. Also as shown there, the handle axis 14 is spaced from the cutting force Fc in a direction perpendicular to the cutting force Fc by a second distance B. In addition, the handle axis 14 is spaced from<br>
the loading force FL in a direction perpendicular to the loading force FL by a<br>
13<br><br>
third distance C. Also, as noted above, the applied force FA is applied at a<br>
distance E from the handle axis 14. Lastly, the blade axis 22 is spaced from<br>
the loading force FL in a direction perpendicular to the loading force FL by a<br>
fourth distance D to provide a mechanical advantage MA according to:<br>
MA = Fc=	E-D)<br>
FA    (B-D) + (C-A).<br>
