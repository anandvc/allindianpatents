DESCRIPTION<br>
HUMAN MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AGAINST A COSTIMULATORY SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION MOLECULE AILIM AND PHARMACEUTICAL USE THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to human antibodies which bind to AILIM (activation inducible lymphocyte immunomodulatory molecule, also referred to as ICOS (inducible co-stimulator) ; human monoclonal antibodies which bind to AILIM or a portion thereof; DNA encoding said human monoclonal antibody or a portion thereof, or a portion of said DNA; cells (including genetic recombinant cells) producing said human monoclonal antibody or a portion thereof; human monoclonal antibody or a portion thereof produced by said genetic recombinant cells; pharmaceutical composition comprising said human monoclonal antibody or a portion thereof; pharmaceutical composition comprising antibody to AILIM for treating disorders related to the delayed allergy; method for identifying, cjuantitating or assaying substances that bind to AILIM or AILIM ligand; and kix used for said method.<br>
Background Art<br>
A living body of mammals has immune response systems that excludes pathogenic microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) or foreign bodies (both are called 'antigen" in the following) that have invaded the living body . One of them is called natural immune response system, another acquired immune response system. The former is an exclusion mechanism comprising phagocytosis by phagocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes , monocytes, macrophages, etc.) , attack by natural killer (NK) cells, and non-specific recognition such as opsonization of antigen by complements. The latter, acquired immune response system, is an exclusion mechanism by lymphocytes (mainly, T cells and B cells) that acquired the specificity to the antigen (namely, activated lymphocytes). B cells that acquired antigen specificity attack the antigen existing outside of the cells through production of antibodies specific to the antigen. T cells that acquired antigen specificity  (namely, activated T cells)  are<br><br>
classified into helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells (cytotoxic lymphocyte, CTL). The helper T cells regulate a differentiation of B cells and a production of antibodies, and destroy the antigen cooperating with phagocytes . The latter, CTLs attack virus-infected cells and so on by themselves (Experimental Medicine: SUPPLEMENT, "Bio Science Term Library, Immunity", Yodosha, pp.14-17 (1995)). This acquisition of antigen specificity by T cells (namely, activation of T cells) is initiated through recognition by T cells the antigen presented by antigen-presenting cells (APC) such as macrophage, B cells, or dendritic cells. Antigen-presenting cells process the antigens so incorporated and present these processed antigens through binding them to major histocompatibility complex (MHC). T cells receive primary signal for activation of the cells (or acquisition of specificity) by recognizing the processed antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells through a complex between T cell receptor (TcR) and CDS antigen existing on the surface of the cell membrane (TcR/CD3 complex).<br>
However, the TcR/CDS complex-mediated primary signal alone cannot activate T cells sufficiently and leads to unresponsiveness or clonal anergy, so that the cells can not react with any stimulation received thereafter. The autocrine of interleukin 2 (IL-2) is necessary for T cells to be activated, to be differentiated into antigen specific T cell clones, and to be proliferated. In clonal anergy, T cells are inactivated due to no production of IL-2 and such and no cell division. Namely, the activation of T cells accompanied by production of cytokines such as IL-2 requires the secondary signal following the first signal through TcR/CD3 complex. This secondary signal is called costimulatory signal.<br>
T cells receive this secondary signal and transmit it into the<br>
cells by interacting (cell adhesion) with molecules other than MHC<br>
on antigen-presenting cells through molecules other than TcR/CD3<br>
complex on the T cell surface. This secondary signal avoids cell anergy<br>
(clonal anergy) and activates the cells.<br>
Although some part of the mechanism of the secondary signal transmission between antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes such as T cells have not yet been elucidated in detail, studies so far<br><br>
have revealed that an important factor for the secondary signal transmission is the interaction of CD28 (also named Tp44, T44, or 9.3 antigen), which is a cell surface molecule expressed mainly on T cells and thymus cells, with CD80 (also named B7-1, B7, BBl, or B7/BB1) , which is a cell surface molecule expressed on antigen-presenting cells (macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and with CD86 (also named B7-2 or B70), which is also a cell surface molecule on antigen-presenting cells (namely, cell adhesion through the binding between these molecules) . Moreover, it has been experimentally elucidated that the interaction of Cytolytic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) , whose expression is thought to be enhanced depending on the secondary signal, with the CD80 (B7-1) and CDS6 (B7-2) (namely, cell adhesion through the binding between these molecules) also plays an important role in the regulation of T cell activation by the secondary signal. In other words, the regulation of T cell activation by the transmission of the secondary signal involves at least the interaction between CD28 and CD80/CD86, the enhancement of CTLA-4 expression, which is thought to depend on the interaction, and the interaction between CTLA-4 and CD80/CD86.<br>
CD2 8 is known to be a costimulator molecule transmitting the secondary signal (costimulatory signal) required for the activation of T cells and for the avoidance of anergy. The secondary signal transmitted by binding this molecule to costimulator molecules, CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2}, on antigen-presenting cells (cell adhesion through the binding between these molecules) , stabilizes mJRNA of Thl-type cytokines and consegaently promotes production by T cells of a large amount of Thl-type cytokines such as IL-2, IFNy, and TNPa. The expression of CTLA-4 is induced by the primary signal transmitted through TcR/CD3, and the expression is also enhanced by the secondary signal transmitted by the binding between CD28 and CD80. It is being revealed that CTLA-4 receives these signals to work to inhibit T cell function, which is contrary to the activation of T cells by the secondary signal transmitted by CD28.<br>
Human CD28 and CTLA-4 are type I glycoproteins whose molecular weights are 44 kD and 41 to 43 kD, respectively. Both have an iramunoglobulin-like domain, belong to the immunoglobulin superf amily,<br><br>
and have both function as a cell adhesion molecule and function as a signal transmission molecule.<br>
Human CD28 forms a homodimer with a disulfide bond while CTLA-4 exists as a monomer. Both CD28 and CTLA-4 genes are located at ^2q33" on human chromosome and "IC" on mouse chromosome, and are composed of four (4) exons. Human CD28 and CTLA-4 are composed of 220 and 223 amino acids, respectively, including the leader sequences, and amino acid homology between them is 20 to 30%.<br>
The ligands for CD28 and CTLA-4 are CD80 (BV-l) and CD86 (B7-2) in human and mice. CTLA-4 has about 20 times as high affinity to both ligands as CD28. It has been elucidated that the amino acid sequence structures "MYPPPY (Met-Tyr-Pro-Pro-Pro-Tyr)" conserved through animal species is important for the binding of CD28 and CTLA-4 to CD80 {B7-1) . It has also been reported that, when CD28 is stimulated, PI3 kinase (phosphoinositide 3 kinase, PI3K) associates with the phosphorylated tyrosine residue in a partial sequence "YMNM (Tyr-Met-Asn-Met) " of CD2 8 and that CD28 plays an important role in intracellular signal transmission through this "YxxM" structure. Furthermore, it has been reported that CTLA-4 also has a sequence represented by "YxxM," namely '^YVKM (Tyr-Val-Lys-Met) " in its cytoplasmic region and that, after being stimulated, SYP associates with this sequence.<br>
CD2 8 is expressed specifically in thymocytes and peripheral blood T cells, and CTLA-4 is expressed specifically in activated T cells (Cell Engineering: SUPPLEMENT, "Handbook of Adhesion Molecule" , Shujunsha, pp.93-102 (1994) ; ibid. pp. 120-136; Experimental Medicine: SUPPLEMENT, "BIO SCIENCE Term Library, Immunity", Yodosha, pp.94-9 8 (199 5) ; Experimental Medicine : SUPPLEMENT, "BIO SCIENCE Term Library, Intracellular Signal Transduction", Yodosha, pp.58-59 (1997); Nihon Rinsho, Vol.55, No.6, pp.215-220 (1997)).<br>
In the regulation of T cell function (the activation and the inhibition of function of T cells), the importance of interactions among multiple molecules such as costimulator molecules (CD28, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2), etc.) and CTLA-4, which cooperates with them, has thus been recognized, and this has been drawn attention to the relationship between these molecules and diseases, and the treatment<br><br>
of diseases by regulating the function of these molecules.<br>
As described above, although a living body activates its acquired immune response system against antigens that are foreign bodies to the living body (self), it also has immunological tolerance so as to show no immune response against its own component (autoantigen). If immunological tolerance breaks down by some reason, immune response to the autoantigen occurs, autoantigen-reactive T cells are induced by the same mechanism as mentioned above to fall into abnormal state of immunity, and various autoimmune diseases are caused.<br>
In other words, since non-stimulated antigen presenting cells (APC) in normal tissues do not express costimulatory molecules when the immune system of a living body is normal, T cells are in the unresponsiveness state to maintain immunological tolerance even if autoantigen-reactive T cells, which reacts with autoantigen, exist. It has been suggested that in abnormal state of immunity, more autoantigen-reactive T cells are activated due to abnormal excess and continuous expression of costimulatory molecules to thereby cause autoimmune diseases.<br>
From such viewpoints recently, many attempts to treat various autoimmune diseases by modulating the transmission of costimulatory signals , for example, the above-mentioned signal transmission between CD28/CTLA-4 and CD80/CD86, are proposed.<br>
The results of such attempts have not yet clarified in detail the mechanism of the T cell activation by interaction between costimulatory molecules and the related molecules. Other unknown molecules may be involved in this mechanism.<br>
Recently, there has been identified a novel co-stimulatory molecule like the above-described "CD28" and "CTLA-4" , which is thought to carry out the transduction of a second signal (co-stimulatory signal) essential for the activation of lymphocytes such as T cells, and functional regulation coupled with said signal of activated lymphocytes such as activated T cells.. This molecule has been designated as AILIM (activation inducible lymphocyte immunomodulatory molecule) (in humans, mice and rats: Int. Immunol. , Vol. 12, No. 1, p.51-55, 2000) , also referred to as ICOS (inducible co-stimulator) (in humans: Nature, Vol. 397, No.6716, p.263-266, 1999)).<br><br>
On the other hand, novel molecules celled B7h, B7RP-1, GL50 or LICOS which are ligands (AILIM ligands) interacting with this costimulatory transmission molecule AILIM (ICOS) have been identified very recently (Nature. Vol.402, No.6763, pp.827-832, 1999; Nature Medicine, Vol.5, No.l2, pp.1365-1369, 1999; J. Immunology, Vol.164, pp.1653-1657, 2000; Curr. Biol., Vol.10, No.6, pp.333-336, 2000).<br>
The identification of these two kinds of novel molecules, namely AILIM (ICOS) andB7RP-l (B7h, GL50, LICOS) , as the signal transduction pathway for the costimulatory signal essential for the above activation of lymphocytes such as T cells, and the control of the function of activated T cells, revealed that there is the novel third pathway by the interaction between AILIM (ICOS) andB7RP-l (B7h, GL50, LICOS) , besides the known first and second signal pathways which are already known transduction pathway between CD28 and CDS0 {B7-1) / CD86 {B7-2) , and that between CTLA4 and CD80 (B7-1) / CD 86 (B7-2).<br>
' Studies on the biological functions of these novel molecules, the function control of lymphocytes, such as T cells, through this third costimulatory signal transduction by the molecules, and the relationship between the novel signal transduction and diseases are in progress (J. Immunol., 166(1), pp.1, 2001; J. Immunol., 165(9), pp.5035, 2000; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. , 276(1) , pp.335, 2000; Immunity, 13(1), pp.95, 2000; J. Exp. Med., 192(1), pp.53, 2000; Eur. J. Immunol., 30(4), pp.1040, 2000; WO 01/15732).<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Specifically, an objective of the present invention is to reveal biological functions of the novel molecule AILIM, considered, like "CD28" and "CTLA-4" , as a molecule which transmits the secondary signal (costimulatory signal) essential for the activation of lymphocytes, such as T cells, and which controls the functions of activated lymphocytes, such as activated T cells, by working with the signal; to reveal relationships between the expression of AILIM and diseases; and to provide a method and a pharmaceutical which inhibit the development of the various diseases dependent on the express ion pattern of AILIM or which treat the diseases by controlling the biological functions of the AILIM using the medical and pharmaceutical methods<br><br>
(for example, a drug such as a monoclonal antibody and a low molecular compound).<br>
To achieve the above-described purposes, the present inventors have actively pursued studies on human antibodies (particularly human monoclonal antibodies) against mammalian AILIMs (particularly human AILIM) , and as a result, by immunizing transgenic mice prepared using genetic recombination techniques so as to produce human antibodies with AILIM (specifically cell membrane fraction of cells expressing human AILIM), succeeded first in the world in preparing a variety of monoclonal antibodies which bind to human AILIM, particularly those which bind to human AILIM that regulate signal transduction mediated by human AILIM.<br>
Since antibodies (particularly monoclonal antibodies) of this invention are derived from humans, they do not induce any severe immune rejection due to the immunogenicity against humans , KAMA (hioman anti-mouse antigenicity) , in the host at all, which has been a big problem (side effect) in therapy using antibody pharmaceuticals comprising antibodies derived from non-human mammals such as mice, and thus dramatically enhancing the value of antibody as medicine.<br>
Therefore, human antibodies (particularly human monoclonal antibodies) which bind to mammalian AILIMs (particularly human AILIM) of this invention and pharmaceutical compositions comprising said human antibodies (particularly humanmonoclonal antibodies) are useful as drugs to control, with no induction of immune rejection due to HAMA in the host, various physiological reactions related to the transduction of co-stimulatory signal to AILIM-expressing cells mediated by AILIM (for example, proliferation of AILIM-expressing cells, cytokine productionby AILIM-expressing cells, immune cy to lysis or apoptosis of AILIM-expressing cells, and activity to induce antibody-dependent cytotoxicity to AILIM-expressing cells, and so on) , and/or are also useful as drugs to suppress and prevent development of symptoms and/or progress of various disorders related to the signal transduction mediated by said AILIM, and as medicine to treat or prevent said disorder.<br>
Specifically, pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention are able to control (suppress or stimulate) proliferation<br><br>
of AILIM-expressing cells or production of cytokine (for example, interf eronyor interleukin 4 , etc.) by AILIM-expressing cells , thereby enabling suppression of various pathological conditions and treatment or prevention of various disorders caused by diverse physiological phenomena related to signal transduction mediated by AILIM.<br>
Use of pharmaceutical compositions according to this invention enables suppression, prevention and/or treatment of, for example, various disorders (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis , allergic contact-type dermatitis, chronic inflammatory dermatosis such as lichen planus, systemic lupus erythematosus, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , psoriasis, etc. ) classified into autoimmune or allergic disorders (particularly autoimmune disease and delayed allergy caused by cellular immunity) ; arthropathia (for example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA)), inflammation (e.g. hepatitis); graft versus host reaction (GVH reaction) ; graft versus host disease (GVHD) ; immune rejection accompanying transplantation (homoplasty or heteroplasty) of a tissue (tissues such as skin, cornea, bone, etc.) or organ (liver, heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, etc.); immune response triggered by a foreign antigen or autoantigen (for example, production of antibodies against said antigen, cell proliferation, production of cytokines) ; and disorders possibly caused by the abnormal intestinal immunity (specifically inflammatory intestinal disorders (particularly clone disease and ulcerative colitis) and alimentary allergy).<br>
Furthermore, in the field of suppression/treatment of immune rejection accompanying transplantation of above-described tissues and organs, it is possible to augment the suppressive effect on transplant rejection of known immunosuppressant by using the pharmaceutical composition of this invention together with said drugs which have been utilized for suppression of immune rejection in such a transplantation treatment.<br>
Moreover, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be applied for treating or preventing, any inflammatory diseases to which various steroids are indicated as antiphlogistic.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be applied to inflammatory disease for example, inflammation accompanying<br><br>
various arthritis (for example, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis) , pneumonia, hepatitis (including viral hepatitis), inflamination accompanying infectious diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, intestinal enteritis, nephritis (inflarnmation accompanying glomerular nephritis, nephrofibrosis), gastritis, angiitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis, bronchitis, myocarditis, cerebritis, inflammation in postischemic reperfusion injury (myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury) , inflammation attributed to immune rejection after transplantation of tissue and organ, burn, various skin inflammation (psoriasis, allergic contact-type dermatitis, lichen planus which is chronic inflammatory skin disease) , inflammation in multiple organ failure, inf larnmation after operation of PTCA or PTCR, and inflammation accompanying arteriosclerosis, and autoimmune thyroiditis.<br>
In addition, by using a method for identifying substances that bind to AILIM or AILIM ligand, which is one of the present inventions, it becomes possible to screen to select pharmaceuticals (chemical synthetic compounds or antibodies) with potential activity to treat various disorders by binding to AILIM or AILIM ligands to regulate signal transduction mediated by interaction of them.<br>

The present inventions are described in detail herein below by defining terminologies of the present invention.<br>
Herein, "mammal" means human, bovine, goat, rabbit, mouse, rat, hamster, and guinea pig; preferred is human, rabbit, rat, hamster, or mouse and particularly preferred is human, rat, hamster, or mouse.<br>
The term "mammals other than humans" and "non-human mammals" used herein, are synomic to each other, meaning all mammals other than humans defined above.<br>

The term "AILIM" used herein is the abbreviation for Activation Inducible Lymphocyte Immunomodulatory Molecule, indicating a mammalian cell surface molecule having the structure and function as already described in a previous report, more preferably a human-derived AILIM in particular (for example. International Immunology, Vol. 12, No. 1, p.51-55;GenBankAccessionNumber:BAA82129 (human) , BAA82128 (rat) , BAA82127  (rat variant) , and BAA82126<br><br>
(mouse)).<br>
Alternatively, this AILIM is also referred to as ICOS (Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application (JP-A) No. Hei 11-29599, International Patent Application No. W098/38216) , and these abbreviations indicate the same molecule.<br>
"AILIM ligand" used herein means a cell surface molecule which interacts with said co-stimulatory molecule AILIM (ICOS), and is referred to as B7h, B7RP-1, GL50 or LICOS (Nature, Vol. 402, No. 6763, p. 827-832, 1999; Nature Medicine, Vol. 5, No. 12, p. 1365-1369, 1999; J. Immunology, Vol. 164, p.1553-1657, 2000; Curr. Biol. Vol. 10, No. 6, p.333-336, 2000).<br>
Moreover, '"AILIM' usedherein also includes a polypeptide having substantially the same amino acid sequence as that of AILIM of each mammal described in the references, and particularly preferably, that of human AILIM. Furthermore, a human AILIM variant which is similar to the rat AILIM variant already reported (GenBank Accession Number: BAA82127) is also included in "AILIM" of this invention.<br>
"AILIM ligand" used herein is also defined to have a similar meaning as above.<br>
Herein, "polypeptides having essentially identical amino acid sequence" means variant polypeptides as described below.<br>
That is, as long as these variant polypeptides have biological properties essentially equivalent to the natural type AILIM (particularly preferably the human-derived AILIM), they are polipeptides of this invention. Like those having amino acid sequence of the natural type AILIM, in which a plurality of amino acid residues , preferably 1 to 10 amino acid residues, most preferably 1 to 5 amino acid residues are deleted and/or modified, and to which a plurality of amino acid residues, preferably 1 to 10 amino acid residues, most preferably 1 to 5 amino acid residues are added.<br>
Furthermore , they may be variant polypeptides having plurality of these substitution, deletion, modification and addition of amino acid residues in the molecule.<br>
"AILIM ligand" in this invention is also defined to have a similar meaning as above.<br>
AILIM (particularly human AILIM) and AILIM ligand (particularly<br><br>
human AILIM ligand) in this invention can be prepared by, in addition to gene recombinant technique, appropriately using well-known methods in this technical field such as chemical synthesis method, cell culture method, etc. or these methods with modifications.<br>
Such substitution, deletion, or insertion of amino acids can be achieved according to the usual method (Experimental Medicine: SUPPLEMENT, "Handbook of Genetic Engineering" (1992); and so on).<br>
Examples of methods for producing mutant polypeptides as mentioned above are synthetic oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (gapped duplex method) ,. point mutagenesis by which a point mutation is introduced at random by treatment with nitrite or sulfite, the method by which a deletion mutant is prepared with Bal31 enzyme and the like, cassette mutagenesis, linker scanning method, miss incorporation method, mismatch primer method, DNA segment synthesis method, etc.<br>
Synthetic oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis (gapped duplex method) can be, for example, performed as follows. The region desired to be mutagenized is cloned into M13 phage vector having amber mutation to prepare the single-stranded phage DNA. After RF I DNA of Ml3 vector without amber mutation is linearized by restriction enzyme treatment, DNA is mixed with the single-stranded phage DNA mentioned above, denatured, and annealed thereby forming "gapped duplex DNA." A synthetic oligonucleotide into which mutations are introduced is hybridized with the gapped duplex DNA and the closed-circular double-stranded DNAs are prepared by the reactions with DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. E. coli mutS cells, deficient in mismatch repair activity, are transfected with this DNA. E. coli cells without suppressor activity are infected with the grown phages, and only phages without amber mutation are screened.<br>
The method by which a point mutation is introduced with nitrite utilizes, for example the principle as mentioned below. If DNA is treated with nitrite, bases are deaminated to change adenine into hypoxanthine, cytosine into uracil, and guanine into xanthine. If deaminated DNA is introduced into cells, "A:T" and "G:C" are replaced with "G:C" and "A:T", respectively, because hypoxanthine, uracil, and xanthine form a base pair with cytosine, adenine, and thymine,<br><br>
respectively, in the DNA replication. Actually, single-stranded DNA fragments treated with nitrite are hybridized with "gapped duplex DNA", and thereafter mutant strains are separated by manipulating in the same way as synthetic oligonucleotide site-directedmutagenesis (gapped duplex method).<br>
In addition, "AILIM" herein also includes "a portion" of said AILIM. Herein, "a portion" means a polypeptide comprising any partial sequence of the above-defined AILIM amino acid sequence.<br>

Furthermore, monoclonal antibody of this invention can be also obtained from culture supernatant by culturing a "genetic recombinant host" [herein, said host is an eukaryotic cell other than fertilized eggs (preferably mammalian cells such as CHO, lymphocytes, and myeloma cells)], which can be prepared by transforming a host with cDNAs (preferably a vector containing said cDNAs) encoding each of the heavy and light chains of such a human monoclonal antibody of this invention using genetic recombination techniques, and which produces genetic recombinant human monoclonal antibody.<br>
Specifically, the monoclonal antibody of this invention can be obtained by culturing genetic recombinant host described in any of aforementioned (60) through (62) or (64) through (80) of this invention (herein, said host is an eukaryotic cell other than a fertilized egg (preferably mammalian cells such as CHO, lymphocytes, and myeloma cells)).<br>
In addition, human monoclonal antibody of this invention may<br>

Preferably, said monoclonal antibody belongs to IgG (IgGl, IgG2, IgG3<br>
and IgG4), more preferably IgGl, IgG2 or IgG4.<br>
Human monoclonal antibody of this invention can be prepared<br>
by immunizing transgenic non-human mammal producing human antibody<br>
such as human antibody-producing transgenic mouse described below<br>
with any of the immunogens (antigens) aforementioned in (a) through<br>
(f) according to known commonly used manufacturing method.<br>
That is, for example, said transgenic non-human mammal producing human antibody is immunized with said antigen in combination with Freund's adjuvant as the occasion demands. Polyclonal antibody can be obtained from sera collected from said immunized animal. Monoclonal antibody can be manufactured by preparing fusion cells (hybridomas) from said antibody-producing cells isolated from said immunized animal and myeloma cells with no autoantibody-producing ability, and cloning said hybridomas to select a clone producing the monoclonal antibody with a specific affinity to the antigen used for immunizing the mammal.<br><br>
More specifically, monoclonal antibody can be prepared as described below. That is, said human antibody-producing transgenic non-human mammal (particularly preferably ^'human antibody-producing transgenic mouse") is immunized by injecting any of the immunogens aforementioned in (a) through (c) intradermally, intramuscularly, intravenously, into the footpad, or intraperitoneally once to several times, or transplanting said immunogen into said mammal. Usually, immunizations are performed once to four times every one to fourteen days after the first immunization. Antibody-producing cells are obtained from the mammal so immunised in about one to five days after the last immunization. The frequency and interval of immunizations can be appropriately arranged depending on, e.g., property of the immunogen used.<br>
Hybridomas that secrete a human monoclonal antibody can be prepared by the method of KShler and Milstein (Nature, Vol.256, pp.495-497 (1975)) and by its modified method. Namely, hybridomas are prepared by fusing antibody-producing cells contained in a spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, or tonsil obtained from the human antibody-producing transgenic non-human mammal immunized as mentioned above, preferably a spleen, with myelomas without autoantibody-producing ability, which are derived from, preferably, a mammal such as a mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit, or human, or more preferably, a mouse, rat, or human.<br>

Cellsproducingmonoclonalantibodies (forexample,hybridomas) can be screened by cultivating the cells, for example, in microtiter plates and by measuring the reactivity of the culture supernatant in the well in which hybridoma growth is observed, to the immunogen used for the immunization mentioned above, for example, by enzyme immunoassay such as radio immunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immuno-solvent assay (ELISA).<br><br>
The monoclonal antibodies can be produced from hybridomas by cultivating the hybridomas in vitro or in vivo such as in the ascites fluid of a mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, or rabbit, preferably a mouse or rat, more preferably mouse and isolating the antibodies from the resulting the culture supernatant or ascites fluid of a mammal.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies of this invention can be manufactured on a large scale by the following method:<br>
(1)	genes (cDNAs, etc.) encoding each of the heavy and light chains of said monoclonal antibody are cloiied from said hybridomas;<br>
(2)	cloned genes encoding each of the heavy and light chains are inserted into separate vectors or a single vector to prepare the expression vector;<br>
(3)	said expression vector is transferred into a fertilized egg of a desired non-human mammal (such as goat);<br>
(4)	said fertilized egg transferred with the gene is<br>
transplanted into the uterus of a foster mother to obtain a chimeric<br>
non-human animal;<br>
(5)	by further mating said chimeric goat with another non-human<br>
mammal, a transgenic non-human mammal (cattle, goat, sheep or swine)<br>
with genes encoding each of said heavy and light chains incorporated<br>
into the endogenous gene is produced; and<br>
(6)	from the milk of said transgenic non-human mammal,<br>
monoclonal antibody derived from said human monoclonal antibody gene<br>
is obtained on a large scale (Nikkei Science, April, 1997, p.78-84).<br>
Cultivating in vitro the cells producing the monoclonal antibodies can be performed depending on, e.g. , the property of cells to be cultured, the object of a test study, and the various conditions of a cultivating method, by using known nutrient media or any nutrient media derived from known basal media for growing, maintaining, and storing the hybridomas to produce monoclonal antibodies in culture supernatant.<br>
Examples of basal media are low calcium concentration media such as Ham'F12 medium, MCDB153 medium, or low calcium concentration MEMmedium, andhigh calcium concentrationmedia such as MCDBl 04 medium, MEMmedium, D-MEMmedium, RPMIl640 medium, ASF104 medium, or RDmedium. The basal media can contain, for example, sera, hormones, cytokines,<br><br>
and/or various inorganic or organic substances depending on the objective.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and purified from the culture supernatant or ascites fluid mentioned above by saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation, euglobulin precipitation method, caproic acid method, caprylicacidmethod, ion exchange chromatography (DEAE or DE52), affinity chromatography using anti-immunoglobulin column or protein A column.<br>
Human monoclonal antibody of this invention includes human monoclonal antibodies consisting of the heavy chain and/or light chain of which amino acid sequence for each chain have one or more amino acid residues deleted, substituted or added.<br>
Herein, "more amino acid residues" means a plurality of amino acids, specifically 1 to 10 amino acid residues, preferably 1 to 5 amino acid residues.<br>
A partial modification (deletion, substitution, insertion or addition) as described above can be introduced into the amino acid sequence of human monoclonal antibody of this invention by partial alteration of base sequence encoding said amino acid sequence. This partial alteration of base sequence can be introduced by standard method using known site-specific mutagenesis technique (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 81, p.5662-5666, 1984).<br>
'Transgenic human antibody-producing non-human mammal", particularly human antibody-producing transgenic mouse which is a preferred embodiment, can be prepared according to published literature (Nature Genetics, Vol. 7, p.13-21, 1994; Nature Genetics, Vol. 15, p.146-156, 1997; Published Japanese Translation of International Publication No. Hei 4-504365; Published Japanese Translation of Publication No. Hei 7-509137; Nikkei Science, June, p.40-50, 1995; International Patent Publication No. W094/25585; Nature, Vol. 368, p. 856-859, 1994; and Published Japanese Translation of Publication No. Hei 6-500233, etc.)<br>
Specifically, said human antibody-producing transgenic mice can be prepared, for example, using techniques consisting of the following processes:<br>
(1) preparing a knockout mouse which endogenous immunoglobulin<br><br>
heavy chain gene is functionally inactivated by substituting at least a portion of gene locus of the mouse endogenous immunoglobulin heavy chain with a drug tolerance marker gene (such as neomycin tolerance gene) by homologous recombination;<br>
(2)	preparing a knockout mouse which endogenous immunoglobulin<br>
light chain gene (particularly the K chain gene) is functionally inactivated by substituting at least a portion of gene locus of the mouse endogenous immunoglobulin light chain with a drug tolerance marker gene (such as neomycin tolerance gene) by homologous recombination;<br>
(3)	preparing a transgenic mouse which desired region of the human immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus is incorporated into the mouse chromosome using a vector represented by the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) capable of carrying a giant gene;<br>
(4)	preparing a transgenic mouse which desired region of the<br>
human immunoglobulin light chain gene locus (particularly the K chain gene) is incorporated into the mouse chromosome using a vector represented by the yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) capable of carrying a giant gene; and<br>
(5)	preparing a transgenic mouse which endogenous<br>
immunoglobulin heavy and light chains gene loci are both functionally<br>
inactivated and which chromosome is incorporated with the desired<br>
regions of both of the human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains<br>
gene loci by mating knockout and transgenic mice aforementioned in<br>
(1) through (4) in arbitrary orders.<br>
The above-described knockout mouse can be prepared by substituting the suitable region of the mouse endogenous immunoglobulin gene locus with a foreign marker gene (such as neomycin tolerance gene) based on homologous recombination to inactivate said gene locus so as not to be rearranged. For the inactivation using said homologous recombination, for example, a method referred to as positive negative selection (PNS) can be used (Nikkei Science, May, p.52-62, 1994) .<br>
Functional inactivation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus can be achieved, for example, by introducing a lesion into a part of the J- or C-region (for example, C(X region) . And functional<br><br>
inactivation of the immunoglobulin light chain (for example, K chain) can be achieved, for example, by introducing a lesion into a part of J- or C-region, or a region extending over J- and C-regions.<br>
A transgenic mouse can be prepared according to the method as usually used for producing a transgenic animal (for example, see "Newest Manual of Animal Cell Experiment", LIC press. Chapter 7, pp. 361-408, (1990)). Specifically, for example, the HPRT-negative (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene deficient) ES cell (embryonic stem cell) derived from a normal mouse blastocyst is fused with yeast containing the YAC vector inserted with the gene encoding said human immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus or light chain gene locus or a portion thereof and the HPRT gene using spheroplast fusion method. ES cells whose mouse endogenous gene is integrated with said foreign gene are selected by HAT selection method. Then, the ES cells screened are microinjected into a fertilized egg obtained from another normal mouse (blastocyst) (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.77, No.12, pp.7380-7384 (1980); U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191). The blastocyst is transplanted into the uterus of another normal mouse as the foster mother. Then, chimeric transgenic mice are born from the foster mother mouse. By mating the chimeric transgenic mice with normal mice, heterogeneic transgenic mice are obtained. By mating the heterogeneic transgenic mice with each other, homogeneic transgenic mice are obtained according to Mendel's laws.<br>
The "portion of a monoclonal antibody" used in the present invention means a partial region of the above-mentioned human monoclonal antibody of the present invention, and specifically, includes F(ab')2r Fab' , Fab, Fv (variable fragment of antibody) , sFv, dsFv (disulfide stabilized Fv) , or dAb (single domain antibody) (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, Vol.6, No.5, pp.441-456 (1996)).<br>
"F (ab') 2" and "Fab' " can be produced by treating immunoglobulin (monoclonal antibody) with a protease such as pepsin and papain, and means an antibody fragment generated by digesting immunoglobulin near the disulfide bonds in the hinge regions existing between each of the two H chains. For example, papain cleaves IgG upstream of the disulfide bonds in the hinge regions existing between each of the two H chains to generate two homologous antibody fragments in which<br><br>
an L chain composed of VL (L chain variable region) and CL (L chain constant region) , andanHchainfragment composedof VH (H chain variable region) and CHYI (yl region in the constant region of H chain) are connected at their C terminal regions through a disulfide bond. Each of such two homologous antibody fragments is called Fab'. Pepsin also cleaves IgG downstream of the disulfide bonds in the hinge regions existing between each of the two H chains to generate an antibody fragment slightly larger than the fragment in which the two above-mentioned Fab ' are connected at the hinge region. This antibody fragment is called F(ab')2.<br>
"Binding rate constant (ka)" herein means a value indicating the binding strength (degree) of said monoclonal antibody to the target antigen calculated based on the antibody antigen reaction kinetics. "Dissociation rate constant (kd)" means a value indicating the dissociation strength (degree) of said monoclonal antibody from the target antigen. "Dissociation constant (Kd)" is a value obtained by dividing said "dissociation rate constant (kd) " by said "binding rate constant (ka)" value. These constants are used to represent the affinity of said monoclonal antibody to antigen and its activity to neutralize antigen.<br>

Immunoglobulin has a Y-shaped structural unit in which four chains composed of two homologous light chains (L chains) and two homologous heavy chains (H chains) are connected through disulfide bonds (S-S bonds) . The light chain is composed of the light chain variable region (VL) and the light chain constant region (CL) .

IgA, and IgD, and is the region composed of C2 domain, C3 domain, and C4 domain from each of IgM and IgE. A particularly preferable example thereof is the Fc region of human-derived IgGl.<br>
The fusion polypeptide mentioned above has the advantage that the fusion polypeptide can be purified extremely easily by using affinity column chromatography using the property of protein A, which binds specifically to the immunoglobulin fragment because the fusion polypeptide of the present invention has a portion of a constant region (for example Fc) of an immunoglobulin such as IgG as mentioned above as a fusion partner. Moreover, since various antibodies against the Fc of various immunoglobulins are available, an immunoassay for the fusion polypeptides can be easily performed with antibodies against the Fc.<br>

"Pharmaceutical composition" herein means a composition useful as a drug comprising as the effective ingredients antibody (preferably human antibody), which binds to AILIM (preferably human AILIM) or a portion thereof, or monoclonal antibody (preferably human monoclonal antibody) or a portion thereof and a "pharmacologically acceptable carrier".<br>
The "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes a excipient, a diluent, an expander, a decomposition agent, a stabilizer, a preservative, a buffer, an emulsifier, an aromatic, a colorant, a sweetener, a viscosity increasing agent, a flavor, a solubility increasing agent, or other additives.<br>
Using one or more of such carriers , a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated into tablets , pills, powders, granules, injections, solutions, capsules, troches, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, or syrups.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition can be administered orally or parenterally. Other forms for parenteral administration include a solution  for  external  application,  suppository  for  rectal<br><br>
administration, and pessary, prescribed by the usual method, which comprises one or more active ingredient.<br>
The dosage can vary depending on the age, sex, weight, and symptom of a patient, effect of treatment, administration route, period of treatment, or the kind of active ingredient (polypeptide or antibody mentioned above) contained in the pharmaceutical composition. Usually, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered to an adult in a dose of 10 fig to 1000 mg (or 10 |J,g to 500 mg) per one administration. Depending on various conditions , the dosage less than that mentioned above may be sufficient in some cases, and the dosage more than that mentioned above may be necessary in other cases.<br>
In .particular, the injection can be produced by dissolving or suspending the antibody in a non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as physiological saline or commercially available distilled water for injection with adjusting a concentration to 0.1 (j.g antibody/ml carrier to 10 mg antibody/ml carrier.<br>
The inj ection thus produced canbe administered to a human patient in need of treatment in a dose of 1 [ig to 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably 50 \lg to 50 mg/kg body weight once or more times a day.

The injection can be sterilized by filtration with a bacteria-non-penetrated filter, by mixing bacteriocide, or by irradiation. The inj ection can be produced in the form that is prepared upon use. Namely, it is f reeze-dried to be a sterile solid composition, and can be dissolved in sterile distilled water for inj ection or another solvent before use.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the human antibodies of this invention are useful as pharmaceutical preparations, without inducing host immunorej ection due to KAMA (human anti-mouse antibody) , to control a variety of biological reactions (e.g., proliferation<br><br>
of cells expressing AILIM, cytokine production by cells expressing AILIM, iiranune cytolysis or death (ppoptosis) of cells expressing AILIM and others) that are associated with AILIM-mediated transduction of costimulatory signal (secondary signal) to AILIM-expressing cells, and/or as pharmaceutical preparations to treat or prevent various diseases by suppressing and inhibiting the onset and/or progress of diseases associated with AILIM-mediated signal transduction.<br>
The term "immune cytolysis" herein indicates a biological phenomenon as follows.<br>
Lysis of the cell (cytolysis) can be induced by an antibody (particularly cell-lysing antibody) as well as by binding with killer cells. The cell-lysing antibody is a cytotoxic antibody, which particularly has lysing activity on cells such as immune cells, tissue cell or sperms. When the antibody binds to the cell-surface antigen, it causes a cytotoxic effect on the cell or induces cytolysis in the presence of the complement.<br>
This immune cytolysis is induced by the action of the complement in conjunction with specific binding of the antibody to cell-surface antigen. The antibody bound to the surface antigen activates CI complement (CI) . Subsequently cell damage sites are formed through a series of complement-fixation reactions with C2 to C9 complements (C2-C9) , and then cellular contents are released from the cells thereby lysing the cells.<br>
The term "antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity" herein indicates a biological event that is also abbreviated as "ADCC," and is a cytotoxic action on target cells by effector cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages or polymorphonuclear leucocytes, which requires not only effector cells and target cells but also an antibody participating in the induction of the cytotoxic event.<br>
The term "mixed lymphocyte reaction" herein means a biological phenomenon abbreviated as '•"MLR." The reaction is also referred to as mixed leukocyte reaction.<br>
Allogenic leukocytes or lymphocytes derived from distinct individuals are mixed with each other and cultured for several days, thereby allowing blast formation of the cells and DNA synthesis in the cells  (i.e., cell proliferation).  This reaction is referred<br><br>
to as MLR (allogenic MLR).<br>
DNA synthesis (cell proliferation) can be analyzed by arresting proliferation of either of the lymphocytes. The arrest can be accomplished by treatment with irradiation or mitomycin. Analysis can be carried out by measuring the amount of DNA synthesized in the other lymphocyte.<br>
The amount of synthesized DNA can be analyzed by measuring incorporation of thymidine, labeled with radioisotope such as tritium, into the nucleus of the cell.<br>
DNA encoding AILIM (particularly preferably human AILIM) of the present invention can be obtained according to a commonly used method by using procedures for cloning cDNA from mRNA encoding AILIM; procedure for isolating genomic DNA and splicing them; procedure for preparing the DNA by PCR using a cDNA sequence or mRNA sequence as a template; or procedure for chemically synthesizing the DNA.<br>
DNA encoding the AILIM ligand in accordance with the present invention can also be obtained in the same manner as described above.<br>
DNA encoding AILIM (particularly preferably the human AILIM) of the present invention can be prepared by cutting (digesting) DNA comprising DNA encoding AILIM prepared as such with appropriate restriction enzymes, and as required, ligating the resultant DNA fragment with a linker DNA or tag by using an appropriate DNA polymerase or the like. The DNA encoding AILIM ligand can also be prepared in the same manner.<br>
An exemplary method will be shown below to clone the cDNA encoding AILIM (particularly preferably the human AILIM; the protein is hereinafter referred to as the protein of interest) from the mRNA.<br>
A DNA encoding AILIM ligand can also be cloned in the same manner.<br>
First, messenger RNA encoding the protein of interest is prepared from tissues or cells expressing and producing the protein of interest. mRNA can be prepared isolating total RNA by a known method such as quanidine-thiocyanate method (Chirgwin, J.M. et al. , Biochemistry, Vol.18, p5294, 1979) , hot phenol method, or AGPCmethod, and subjecting it to affinity chromatography using oligo-dT cellulose or poly-U Sepharose.<br>
Then, with the mRNA obtained as a template, cDNA is synthesized.<br><br>
for example, by a well-known method using reverse transcriptase such as the method of Okayama et al. (Mol. Cell. Biol. Vol. 2, p. 161 (1982); ibid. Vol.3, p. 280 (1983) ) or the method of Hoffman et al. (Gene Vol.25, p. 263 (1983)) , and converted into double-strandedcDNA. AcDNAlibrary is prepared by transforming^, coil with plasraid vectors , phage vectors , or cosmid vectors having this cDNA or by transfecting E. coli after in vitro  packaging.<br>
The plasmid vectors used in this invention are not limited as long as they are replicated and maintained in hosts . Any phage vectors that can be replicated in hosts can also be used. Examples of usually used cloning vectors are pUC19, A.gtlO, Xgtll, and so on. When the vector is applied to immunological screening as mentioned below, the vector having a promoter that can expres s a gene encoding the polypeptide of the present invention in a host is preferably used.<br>
cDNA can be inserted into a plasmid by, for example, the method of Maniatis et al. (Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, p.1.53, 1989). cDNA can be inserted into a phage vector by, for example, the method of Hyunh etal. (DNA cloning, a practical approach, Vol. 1, p. 49 (1985)). These methods can be simply performed by using a commercially available cloning kit (for example, a product from Takara Shuzo). The recombinant plasmid or phage vector thus obtained is introduced into appropriate host cells such as a prokaryote (for example, E. coli: XLlBlue MRF', DH5a, HBlOl, MC1061/P3, etc.).<br>
Examples of a method for introducing a plasmid into a host are calcium chloride method, calcium chloride/rubidium chloride method described in Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, p.1.74 (1989)), and electroporation method. Phage vectors can be introduced into host cells by, for example, a method in which the phage DNAs are introduced into grown hosts after in vitro packaging. In vitro packaging can be easily performed with a commercially available in vitro packaging kit (for example, a product from Stratagene or Araersham) .<br>
The cDNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention can be isolated from the cDNA library so prepared according to the method mentioned above by combining general cDNA screening methods.<br><br>
For example , a clone comprising the desired cDNA can be screened by a known colony hybridization method (Crunstein et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.72, p.3951 (1975)) or plaque hybridization method (Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, second edition. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, p.2.108 (1989)) using ^^P-labeled chemically synthesized oligonucleotides as probes, which are corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of the present invention. Alternatively, a clone having a DNA fragment encoding a specific region within the polypeptide of the present invention can be screened by amplifying the region by PCR with synthetic PCR primers.<br>
When a cDNA library prepared using a cDNA expression vector<br>
(for example, XZAPIl phage vector) is used, the desired clone can be screened by the antigen-antibody reaction using an antibody against the polypeptide of the present invention. A screening method using PCR method is preferably used when many clones are subjected to screening.<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the DNA thus obtained can be determined by Maxam-Giibert method (Maxam et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol.74, p.560 (1977)) or the dideoxynucleotide synthetic chain termination method using phage M13 (Sanger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol,74, pp.5453-5467 (1977)). The whole or a portion of the gene encoding the polypeptide of the present invention can be obtained by excising the clone obtained as mentioned above with restriction enzymes and so on.<br>
The DNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention can be isolated from the genomic DNA derived from the cells expressing the polypeptide of the present invention as mentioned above by the following methods.<br>
Such cells are solubilized preferably by SDS or proteinase K, and the DNAs are deproteinized by repeating phenol extraction. RNAs are digested preferably with ribonuclease. The DNAs obtained are partially digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and the DNA fragments obtained are amplified with appropriate phage or cosmid to generate a library. Then, clones having the desired sequence are detected, for example, by using radioactively labeled DNA probes, and the whole or a portion of the gene encoding the polypeptide of<br><br>
the present invention is obtained from the clones by excision with restriction enzyme and so on.<br>

The extracellular region (soluble AILIM) of AILIM of the invention (particularly preferably the human AILIM) can be produced by culturing the above-mentioned transformed cells (particularly, animal cell or E. coli) and allowing the secretion of the protein in the culture supernatant. Narr.ely, a . culture filtrate (supernatant) is obtained by the method such as filtration or centrifugation of the obtained culture, and the polypeptide or polypeptide fragment of the present invention is purified and isolated<br><br>

Example 2 Preparation of hybridoma producing human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody<br>
In the present Example, preparation of monoclonal antibody was carried out according to a typical method as described in "Experimental Medicine (supplement) ,Handbook for Cell Technology" (eds. , T. Kuroki et al. , Yodosha, pp.66-74, 1992) and "Experimental Manual for Monoclonal Antibody" (T. Ando et al., Kodansha, 1991).<br>
Cell membrane fraction prepared from recombinant cells overexpressing human AILIM provided in Example 1 was used as the immunogen of human AILIM.<br>
Animals subj ected to immunization were human antibody-producing<br><br>
transgenic mice created by above-described method (Nature Genetics, Vol.7, p.13-21, 1994; Nature Genetics, Vol.15, p.146-156, 1997; Published Japanese Translation of International Application No. Hei 4-504365; Published Japanese Translation of International Application No. Hei 7-509137; Nikkei Science, June, pp. 40-50, 1995; etc.).<br>
Multi-well microplates were used for cell culture.  Immunization and preparation of hybridoma<br>
Either of the immunogens (lOOjil/mouse/administration) prepared in<l-4> (derived from HPB-ALL) andin<l-5> (derived from CHO) described above was given to the above-mentioned human antibody-producing transgenic mouse. The immunogen was injected together wit Freund's complete adjuvant (ICN/CAPPEL) in the footpad as primary immunization (day 0) .<br>
After primary immunization, either of the two immunogens was additionally inj ected to the footpad at 1-week interval as secondary and/or tertiary immunization. In the same manner, injection was further carried out for final immunization two days before preparation of lymphocytes, which is described below.<br>
Two days after final immunization, lymphocytes were prepared from (subinguinal and subgenual) lymph nodes and spleens of respective transgenic mice subjected to immunization. The lymphocytes andmouse myeloma cells P3/X63-AG8. 653 (ATCCNo. CRL-1580) were mixed at a ratio of 5:1, and polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim) was added thereto as a fusion agent. Then, the mixture was diluted with 10 voliimes of serum-free basal medium EX-CELL301 (JRH Bioscience). Subsequently, the mixed cells were washed with the basal medium and then suspended in HAT medium (IL of basal medium contained 13.61 mg of hypoxanthine, 176 ]ig of aminopterin, and 3.88 mg of thymidine) . The cells were plated on 96-well microplates and cultured for 10-14 days to complete cell fusion. The cell fusion treatment yielded many hybridomas.  Screening of human monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma<br>
A number of hybridomas prepared in  described above were screened with cell ELISA as described below to select hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM.<br>
Respective recombinant HPB-ALL cells and recombinant CHO cells<br><br>
overexpressing human AILIM, which are described above, were plated in each well of ELISA 96-well microplates (Ixio^ cell /well) . Incubation was carried out at Sl^C  for 2 days.<br>
Subsequently, supernatant of each well was discarded, samples of supernatant of each hybridoma culture was added thereto (50(ll/well) , and the mixture was incubated for 1 hour. After the reaction was completed, the mixed sample solution was discarded and each well was washed 3 times with PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma).<br>
Subsequently, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin (Fc) antibody (50[ll of the 2000-fold dilute per well; Ameircan Corex; 1% BSA/PBS) was added to each well in order to detect the heavy chain of human immunoglobulin (human monoclonal antibody) in the hybridoma supernatant. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
On the other hand, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin K chain antibody (50|L11 of the 2D00-fold dilute per well) was added to each well in order to detect the light chain of human immunoglobulin (human monoclonal antibody) in the hybridoma supernatant. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes.<br>
The anti-human IgFc antibody or anti-human IgK antibody was removed from each well of the microplates, and then the plates were washed 3 times with PBS containing 1% BSA. Tetramethylbenzidine (3,3',5,5',-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) , lOOfAl/well, BIO-RAD) was added to each well, and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes.<br>
Subsequently, IN H2SO4 was added to each well (50|il/well) to quench the reaction. The reaction was monitored for absorbance at a wavelength of 450nm by a microplate reader (Model 3550 Microplate Reader, BIO-RAD).<br>
Control ELISA experiment was performed in the same manner as described above by using the following items:<br>
(1)	Wild-type HPB-ALL cells, instead of human AILIM expressing<br>
recombinant HPB-ALL cells;<br>
(2)	Wild-type CHO cells, instead of human AILIM expressing<br>
recombinant CHO cells;<br><br>
(3)	Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human AILIM (SA12 or SG430; JP-All-29599 (Example 12) andW098/38216 (Example 12)) instead of hybridoma supernatant;<br>
(4)	Human monoclonal antibody against KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, PIERCE) instead of hybridoma supernatant.<br>
The human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody was prepared according to the same manner as described above in , by immunizing above-mentioned human antibody-producing transgenic mice with KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, PIERCE).<br>
Many hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibody capable of binding to human AILIM were selected by said screening.  Primary cloning of hybridoma<br>
Many types of hybridoma monoclones were established from the various hybridomas (parental cell lines) , which had been selected in  described above, producing human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM by the following assay procedure.<br>
Respective hybridomas selected in  described above were<br>
plated in 24-well microplates. Cell count of hybridoma in each well<br>
was determined by pipetting.  Subsequently, 10% fetal calf serum<br>
(FCS; Trace Bioscience PTY) , 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) , 1%<br>
HT Supplement (Gibco BRL) and 2.5% T-STIM Culture Supplement<br>
(Collaborative Biomedical Products) were added to EX-CELL301 medium<br>
(JRH Bioscience) containing 4.0 mM L-glutamine and lipid.  The<br>
resulting modified medium was used to dilute hybridomas to IxlO^<br>
cells/ml and the cells were suspended in each well.<br>
Cell suspension (30 0 111 or 600 |il) of each well was combined and mixed well with the modified medium (150 ml or 300 ml) , and then a 200-(il aliquot of the cell suspension was added to each well of multiple 96-well microplates such that each well contained 4 cells of the hybridoma. The above-mentioned modified medium (50ml or 100ml) was freshly added to the remaining cell suspension, which was mixed well, and then the resulting cell suspension was added to each well of other freshly prepared multiple 96-well microplates such that each well contained 2 cells of the hybridoma.<br>
Cultivation was continued for 1 to 2 weeks . After cultivation, single colonies derived from a single hybridoma were found in many<br><br>
wells.<br>
With the cell ELISA as described above in , it was verified that human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM was produced in the culture supernatant in each well containing the colony.  Secondary cloning of hybridoma<br>
Subcloning (secondary cloning) of each clone from the various hybridoma clones obtained in  described above was performed according to the same method as described above in .<br>
Cell density of each well in a 96-well microplate was adjusted to I cell/well in the present experiment.<br>
The screening yielded many hybridoma monoclones producing human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM. Part of the clones included were as below:<br>
(Clone name)<br>
AIF34 (JMabl24), AIF182 (JMab-126), AIF348 (JMab-127), AIF620 (JMab-128) , AIF1052 (JMab~135) , AIH5D3,(JMab-136) , AIH386 (JMab-137) , AII289 (JMab-138) , AII394 {JMab-139), AII48B (JMab-140) , AIJ40 (JMab-141) , The names shown above are used through the present application, namely in all Examples described below including the present Example, and in Figures and Tables containing the assay result obtained in this Example.<br>

By using ELISA and flow cytometry describedbelow, itwas verified that the monoclonal antibody against human AILIM produced by each hybridoma clone, which had been cloned in  described above, was indeed a human monoclonal antibody.<br>
The recombinant HPB-ALL cells overexpressing human AILIM, which had been prepared in Example 1,. were plated in each v-shaped well of microplate (3x10^ cell/well). Cells were cultured at 37°C in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS.<br>
After the culture was completed, the plate was centrifuged (at l,800rpm for 2 minutes) to precipitate the cells, andthen the resulting supernatant was discarded.    Subsequently,  supernatant sample<br><br>

After reaction, each well was washed with the above-mentioned phosphate buffer. Then, the above-mentioned phosphate buffer was added to each well (200^.1/well) in order to suspend the cells.<br>
Analysis was performed to determine the reactivity of the anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody in the culture supernatant of each hybridoma clone to the HPB-ALL cells overexpressing human AILIM in each well.<br>
Control assay was performed in the same manner as described above by using following items:<br>
(1)	Wild-type HPB-ALL cells, instead of human AILIM expressing<br>
recombinant HPB-ALL cells;<br>
(2)	Human monoclonal antibody against KLH (keyhole limpet<br>

The human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody was prepared according<br><br>
to the same manner as described above in , by immunizing the above-mentioned human antibody-producing transgenic mice with KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin, PIERCE).<br>
Based on the result, all of the hybridoma clones described above in  were verified to be human monoclonal antibodies consisting of human-derived heavy chain and human-derived K light chain.<br>
An example of the result is illustrated in Figure 1, which involves assay result for hybridoma clones AIH5D3 {JMab-136) , AII289 (JMab-138) , and AII394 (JMab-139) .  Isotyping of human monoclonal antibody<br>

Example 4 Preparation of human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM (human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody) on large scale and its purification  Method 1<br>
Cells of each hybridoma clone producing human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody, which had been prepared in  described above, were added to a tissue culture flask (50ml, FALCON) , and cultured in ASF104 medium (Ajinomoto) containing 10% Ultra Low Bovine IgG FBS (GIBCO-BRL) to be confluence under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at SV'C. Subsequently, the whole culture liquid was transferred into a new tissue culture flask (750ml, FALCON) , and the cells were cultured in ASF104 medium (Ajinomoto) containing 10% Ultra Low Bovine IgG FBS (GIBCO-BRL) to be confluent under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37^0. 10 to 20 days after the culture, the culture supernatant of each hybridoma was recovered and transferred into a 50-ml polypropylene conical tube (FALCON) . The tube was centrifuged under 500xg for 5 minutes.<br><br>
Subsequently, resulting centrifugal supernatant was filtered through a Sterilization Filter Unit (NALGEN) , and the filtrate was recovered.<br>
The filtrate was loaded onto a HiTrap Protein G column (HiTrap affinity column Protein G; Amersham Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffer (30ml) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min.<br>
Subsequently, the column was washed with phosphate buffer (20ml) , and then the antibody of interest was eluted by loading lOOmM citrate buffer (pH2.0) onto the column at a low rate of about Iml/min. Subsequently, the eluted solution was neutralized with a solution (pH9.0) of 750mM Tris-HCl, and then filtered through a filter (Millipore) to remove white precipitate. The resulting filtrate was dialyzed against phosphate buffer (overnight) and filtered through a filter (Millipore). Thus purified anti-AILIM human monoclonal antibody was obtained from each hybridoma line.<br>
Protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at A280 measured by using a photospectrometer (IA280 =1.41mg/ml).  Method 2<br>
Cells of each hybridoma clone, which had been prepared in  described above, were conditioned in ASF104 medium (Ajinomoto) containing 10% Ultra Low Bovine IgG FBS (GIBCO-BRL) (1-2x10^ Cells/ml each) , and were plated and cultured in Integra Cell Line 1000 (INTEGRA CLIOOO, INTEGRA BIOSCIENCE) . 7 to 10 days after cultivation, when the cell density reached 1x10^ cells/ml, the supernatant of each hybridoma culture was recovered.<br>
Each culture supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Protein G<br>
column (HiTrap affinity column Protein G; Amersham Pharmacia)<br>
pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffer (30ml) at a flow rate of 3ml/min.<br>
Subsequently, the column was washed with phosphate buffer (20ml) ,<br>
and then lOOmM citrate buffer (pH2.0) was loaded onto the column at<br>
a flow rate of about Iml/min to elute the antibody.  Then, a solution<br>
(pH9 . 0) of 750mM Tris-HCl was added to neutralize the eluted solution,<br>
and the resulting solution was filtered through a filter (Millipore)<br>
to remove white precipitate.  The resulting filtrate was dialyzed<br>
against phosphate buffer (overnight) and then filtered through a filter<br>
(Millipore) .  Thus purified anti-AILIM human monoclonal antibody was<br><br>
obtained from each hybridoma line.<br>
Example 5 Reactivity of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody to human AILIM, and cross-reactivity of that to mouse AILIM and rat AILIM<br>
Purified various human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies above were analyzed for their reactivity to human AILIM as well as cross-reactivity to mouse AILIM and rat AILIM by utilizing cell ELISA method.<br> Establishment of ELISA system to determine IgG antibody concentration and preparation of calibration curves<br>
Because all the above-mentioned purified human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies were IgG (IgG2) antibody, ELISA system was established to determine the concentration of IgG antibody.<br>
Goat anti-human IgG (Fc) antibody (1. 2 jlg/ml inPBS; 100\ll/vrell; Organon Teknika) was added to each well of a 96-well ELISA microplate (Nunc) . The plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours to adsorb the anti-IgG (Fc) antibody on the microplate. Subsequently, the supernatant was discarded, and the plate was washed 3 times with phosphate buff er (PBS) containing 0 . 05% Tween20. A blocking reagent (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween20)<br>
was added to each well (200fll/well) and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours to block the anti-IgG (Fc) antibody-fre^ sites on the plate. Then, the blocking reagent was discarded, and each well was washed twice with PBS.<br>
Human-derived IgG2 antibody {50(Xl/well; TheBindingSite) , which was used as a standard antibody, was added at various concentrations (0 to lOOng/ml) to respective wells of the plate and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Surplus solutions of standard antibody were removed and each well was washed 3 times with phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween20.<br>
Subsequently, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG/K antibody was added to each well (4,000 times diluted, 100 ^ll/well, Protos) , and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.<br>
The supernatant was discarded and the microplate was washed 3 times with phosphate buffer containing 0.05% Tween20.  A buffer<br><br>
containing substrate (composition: ortho-phenylenediamine (O-phenylenediamine, OPD; 2Omg)/citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 5.0, 50 ml)/aqueous solution of 30% hydrogen peroxide (ISjil)) was added to each well (100|J.l/well) and the pi ate was incubated at room temperature for about 7 minutes.<br>
Subsequently, 2M sulfuric acid was added to each well (50|J.l/well) to stop the reaction. Calibration curves were made (Figure 2) based on the values of absorbance measured at a wavelength of 490 nm by using a microplate reader.<br>
Control assays were performed with culture medium alone or BSA solution alone as a test substance in the same manner as described above.<br> Analyses for the reactivity of various purified human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies to human AILIM as well as for cross-reactivity of that to mouse AILIM and rat AILIM  Preparation of reagents<br>
Reagents to be used in this cell ELISA were prepared as follows:  Preparation of recombinant CHO cell overexpressing mouse AILIM<br>
Recombinant CHO cells overexpressing mouse AILIM were prepared and obtained in the same manner as described above in  and <l-3>.<br>
cDNA (GenBank Accession Number: AB023132 (cDNA) ; BAA82126 (amino acid)) containing the full-length ORF of mouse AILIM was inserted into a vector pEF-neo, and then the resulting recombinant expression vector was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cell) by a commonly used method for electroporation (960 [iF, 320 V) using a Gene Pulser (BioRad). The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing Geneticin (0.8mg/ml; Gibco BRL) and 10% FCS to select drug-resistant transformed cells, thereby obtaining mouse AILIM-overexpressing recombinant CHO cells.  Preparation of recombinant CHO cell overexpressing rat AILIM<br>
Recombinant CHO cells overexpressing rat AILIM were prepared and obtained in the same manner as described above in  and <l-3>.<br>
A cDNA (GenBank Accession Number: AB023134 (cDNA); BAA82128 (amino acid)) containing the full-length ORF of rat AILIM was inserted into a vector pEF-neo, and then the resulting recombinant expression<br><br>
vector was introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO cell) by a commonly used method for electroporation (960 |1F, 320 V) using a Gene Pulser (BioRad) . The cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing Geneticin (0.8mg/ml; Gibco BRL) and 10% FCS to select drug-resistant transformed cells, thereby obtaining rat AILIM-overexpressing recombinant CHO cells.  Preparation of monoclonal antibody against mouse AILIM<br>
The recombinant CHO cells overexpressing mouse AILIM, which had been prepared in  described above were homogenized, and subjected to ultracentrifugation (100,000xg). Resulting pellet containing cell membrane fraction was recovered and then suspended in PBS. Resulting cell membrane fraction was injected together with Freund's complete adjuvant to Wistar rats in the footpad for primary immunization (day 0) . The antigen of cell membrane fraction was further given to the rats into the footpad on the 7** day, 14'' day and 28^^ day after the primary immunization. The lymph node cells were collected from them 2 days after the final immunization.<br>
The lymph node cells and mouse myeloma cell PAI (JCR No.BOllS; Res. Disclosure, Vol.217, p.155, 1982) were combined at a ratio of 5:1. The cells were fused to each other by using polyethylene glycol 4000 (Boehringer Mannheim) as a fusion agent to prepare monoclonal antibody-producinghybridomas. Selection of hybridomas was achieved by culturing them in ASF104 medium (Ajinomoto) containing HAT, 10% fetal calf serum and aminopterin.<br>
Reactivity of rat monoclonal antibody in the culture supernatant of each hybridoma to mouse AILIM was determined by reacting the culture supernatant with the above-mentioned CHO cells expressing mouse AILIM and then measuring the fluorescence intensity of cells stained with FITC-labeled anti-rat IgG (Cappel) in a EPICS-ELITE flow cytometer. The screening yielded multiple hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody having reactivity against mouse AILIM.<br>
Among them, a hybridoma line was named 'BIO. 5. " Cells of this hybridoma were intraperitoneally injected (10^ to lO' cells/0 . Sml/mouse) to ICR nu/nu mice (female, 7 to 8-weeks old) . 10 to 20 days after the injection, the ascites was collected from each mouse by laparotomy under anesthesia according to a commonly used<br><br>
method. The rat anti-mouse AILIM monoclonal antibody BIO.5 (IgGl)<br>
was prepared from the ascites on a large scale.<br> The reactivity of the antibody to human, mouse and rat AILIM<br>

The result showed that the human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies of the present invention exhibited significantly high specificities to human AILIM.<br>
Further, it has been revealed that 6 types of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies (shown above in (B) and (C) ) are reactive to both mouse AILIM and rat AILIM (binding capability, cross-reactivity).<br>
Example 6 Determination of affinity and neutraliz ing activity of human anti-human AILIMmonoclonal antibody against the antigen (human AILIM) Association rate constant (ka) , dissociation rate constant (kd) and dissociation constant (Kd) with respect to the reaction between each of the purified various human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies prepared above and human AILIM were determined using a commercially available kit Biacore X (Amersham Pharmacia).<br><br> Preparation of antigen to be immobilized on sensor chip<br>
Antigen to be immobilized on sensor chip in the kit was prepared as a recombinant chimeric antigen (hereinafter referred to as "human AILIM-IgFc") consisting of the extracellular region of human AILIM and the constant region (Fc) of human IgGl.<br>
Human AILIM-IgFc was prepared by further purifying the antigen obtained according to the method as described in earlier applications (JP-A 11-29599 (Example 16 (2)) and W098/38216 (Example 16 (2)) by one of the present inventors, Tezuka.<br>
The culture supernatant of recombinant cells producing the human AILIM-IgFc was loaded onto a HiTrap Protein G column (HiTrap affinity column Protein G; Amersham-Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with phosphate buffer (30ml) at a flow'rate of 3ml/min to adsorb the human AILIM-IgFc in the culture supernatant on the column.<br>
Subsequently, the column was washed with phosphate buffer (20ml) , and then lOOmM citrate buffer (pH2.0) was loaded onto the column at a flow rate of about Iml/min to elute the human AILIM-IgFc. Subsequently, the eluted solution was neutralized with a solution (pH9 . 0) of 750mM Tris-HCl, and then dialyzed against phosphate buffer (overnight) . Then, the solution dialyzed was filtered through a filter (Millipore). Thus purified anti-human AILIM-IgFc was obtained.<br>
Protein concentration vias  determined from the absorbance at<br>
A2B0 measured by using a photospsctrometer (IA280 =lmg/ml).   The concentration of human AILIM-IgFc was determined to be 0.28mg/ml.<br>
Purified chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular region of rat AILIM and the constant region (Fc) ofhumanlgGl (rat AILIM-IgFc; JP-A 11-29599 (Example 16 (2)) and W098/38216 (Example 16 (2)) was also prepared according to the same manner as described above. The concentration of the rat AILIM-IgFc obtained was determined to be 0.45mg/ml.  Determination of affinity and neutralizing activity<br>
Experimental procedures except for immobilization of antigen<br>
(human AILIM-IgFc) on the sensor chip, which is described below, were<br>
based on the instruction manual and experimental protocol attached<br>
to   the   commercially   available   assay   kit  Biacore   X<br><br>
(Amersham-Pharmacia).<br>
HBS buffer (containing O.OIM HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 3mM EDTA and 0.005% detergent P20, (pH7.0)) was allowed to flow through a Flow Cell-1 attached to the kit at a flow rate of 5)j,l/min. Subsequently, a solution (15|j,l) containing 0.005M NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) and 0.2MEDC (N-ethyl-N'- (dimethylaitiinopropyl) carbodiimide) was added to activate carboxyl groups of CM coated on the surface of the sensor chip.<br>
Subsequently, 23^1 of human AILIM-IgFc solution {10|j,g/ml; dissolved in lOmM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0)) was added to the to immobilize the human AILIM-IgFc on the sensor chip.  Subsequently,<br>
unreacted activated carboxyl groups were blocked by adding 35^1 of IM ethanol amine hydrochloride. The amounts of human AILIM-IgFc immobilized by the immobilization treatment performed twice was 2,444RU (resonance unit) and 2,213RU, respectively. The unit, RU, corresponds to the mass per unit area; lRU=lpg/mm^.<br>
Flow Cell-2, which is a reference flow cell, was subjected to the capping treatment in the absence of human AILIM-IgFc in the same manner as described above.<br>
Phosphate buffer was allowed to flow through the flow cell (sensor chip) at a flow rate of 20(il/min, and each of purified human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies, which had been prepared in the Example<br>
above, was added thereto (10 to 50|J.g/ml, SOfll) .<br>
Standard condition for the measurement was: association phase for 3 minutes and dissociation phase for 10 minutes . Respective amounts of antibody bound to and released from the antigen were monitored over time to obtain a sensorgram. Dissociation of antibody from the antigen was achieved by running PBS through the sensor chip at a flow<br>
rate of 20Hl/min.<br>
Based on the resulting sensorgram data, association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd) and dissociation constant (Kd; Kd=kd/ka) were computed by using the analytical software (BIAevaluation 3.0) attached to the kit<br>
The affinity and the neutralizing activity of mouse monoclonal antibodies SA12 and SG430 to the human AILIM prepared in the Example described above were also analyzed in the same manner as described<br><br>

It was analyzed whether or not the human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the present invention had the capability of controlling (enhancing and/or inhibiting) human T cell responses (production of cytokines such as I FN-y and IL-4, cell proliferation, etc.), in other words, whether or not the antibodies exhibited regulatory activity on cellular transduction of AILIM-mediated costimulatory signal. Analysis was performed based on the amount of cytokines (IFN-y and IL-4) produced in human T cells as well as the degree of human T cell proliferation as an index.  Dilution of antibody<br>
Anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody 0KT3 (ATCC CRL-8001) was diluted with phosphate buffer (PBS) to final concentration of SM-g/ral.<br>
Each of the various human anti-human AILIMmonoclonal antibodies<br><br>

concentrations of antibodies (40|ig/ml-0 . 0 049|Lig/ral) .  Coating of ttiicroplate with antibody<br>
Each well of 96-well microplates was coated with (1) anti-human CDS monoclonal antibody 0KT3 {8|Xg/ml; 25fil to each well) and any one of the various human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies (40^lg/ml-0.0049|Ag/ml; 25|J,1 to each well), or (2) anti-human CD3 monoclonal antibody 0KT3 (8|Llg/ml; 25|j,l to eachwell) alone. The plates were incubated at 37*0 for 2 hours. Subsequently, the antibody solutions were discarded, and each well was washed 3 times with PBS. After the wash, RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS was added to each<br>
well (lOOlXl/well) , and the plates were incubated at 37*0 for 1 hour. Thus, respective wells of the plates were coated with the antibodies mentioned above in (1) or (2).<br>

(5 persons; donor A, B, C, D and E) . Fraction containing mononuclear cells was preparedby density-gradient centrif ugationusingLymphoPrep<br>
(Nycomed) . Human T cells were separated from the human mononuclear cell fraction according to the manual for experimental procedure by using a Pan-T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi) and Magnetic Sorter. T cell count was determined using a hemacytometer. Human T cells were suspended in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS to prepare human T<br><br>
cell suspension (IxlO^ cell/ml).  Cell culture<br>
(1)	Culture using microplate coated with anti-human CDS antibody and<br>
anti-human AILIM antibody<br>
Human T cell suspension (donor A, B, C, D or E; lOOjll/well; 1x10^ cells/well) was added to each well of the microplate coated with the antibody mentioned above and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 3 days in a CO2 incubator.<br>
After cultivation, aliquots of the resulting culture supernatants (50^11) were stored at -20^0 and then used in the assay described later (assay for IFNy) . After sampling aliquots of the culture supernatants, respective microplates were used for the following assay:<br>
(2)	Culture using microplate coated with anti-human CDS antibody alone<br>
Human T cell suspension (donor D; 100^ll/well; 1x10^ cells/well) was added to each well of the mi croplates coated with the above-mentioned antibody, and then any one of the various human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies was added thereto (25^1 of the antibody of 40ji,g/ml-0.0049fxg/ml) . The plates were incubated at SV'C for 3 days in a CO2 incubator.  Determination of proliferation activity of T cell<br>
Methyl [^H] thymidine (0. 5jACi/well; Amersham-Pharmacia) was added to each well of the plates after incubation, and the plates were incubated at 3 7°C for 6 hours in a CO2 incubator.  After incubation, cells were trapped on GF/C filters (Packard) using Cell Harvester.<br>
Subsequently, the filters were dried at 40'C for 3 hours or longer, and then Microscinti 0 (20jJll/well; Packard) was added thereto. Radioactivity of ^H incorporated of the cells trapped on the filters was measured by a p-counter (TOP COUNT) to analyze the degree of T cell proliferation after cultivation.<br>
Results are shown in Figures 15 to 39.<br>
Result of this assay showed tliat human T cells were significantly<br>
proliferated depending on the concentration of the cells when<br>
microplates were coated with anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody<br>
(human monoclonal antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody) together<br>
with anti-human CD3 antibody.  Further, there were some differences<br><br>
in the degree of cell proliferation among the donors.<br>
On the other hand, human T cells did not grow significantly when plates had been coated with anti-human CD3 antibody alone and anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (human monoclonal antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody) in solution (liquid phase) was used during culturing the cells.<br> Quantification of IFNy in culture supernatant of T cell<br>
For respective cultures of T cells (donors B and C) described<br>
in (1) of , the amounts of IFNy in the culture supernatants were determined by a commercially available human IFNy ELISA KIT (Amersham-Pharmacia; Endogen).<br>
Results are shown in Figures 40 to 47.<br>
Result of this assay showed that the production of IFNy increased significantly depending on the concentration of anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (human monoclonal antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody).<br>
Example 8 Regulatory activity of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody on mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)<br>
It was tested whether or not the human anti-human AILIMmonoclonal antibodies of the present invention were capable of controlling (enhancing and/or inhibiting) T cell responses (production of cytokines such as IFN-y and IL-4, cell proliferation, etc.) , in other words, capable of regulating the transduction of AILIM-mediated costimulatory signal into cells, by analyzing the activity (namely, DNA synthesis in cells) of control] ing T cell proliferation associated with allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (allogenic MLR) as an index.  Preparation of human PBMC and T cell<br>
Peripheral blood (200ml) collected from each normal healthy persons (7 persons; donor A, B, C, D, E, F and G&gt; was dispensed on the layers of Lymphoprep fl5ml; Nycomed) inmicrotubes (50ml; Falcon) . After centrifugation (at IGOOrpm for 10 minutes) , intermediate layers were recovered. Recovered cells were diluted 2 times or further with phosphate buffer, and then centrifuged (at l,800rpm for 10 minutes) . Thus, PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell; 2x10^-5x10^ cell) was<br><br>
prepared. Cell count was determined by using a hemacytometer. An aliquot of the cells to be used in MLR assay (1.08x10^ cell /9 microplates) were taken and kept on ice. Remaining cells were used for the separation of T cells described below.<br>
PanT Isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) was used for the separation of T cells from PBMC. According to the manual attached to the kit, remaining PBMCs were added to the solution attached to the kit, and the solution was incubated. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS containing 5mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA and then re-suspended in PBS. Subsequently, the cell suspension was added to a Positive Selection Column VS+ (Miltenyi Biotech) swollen with PBS, and unadsorbed fraction was recovered. Further, PBS was loaded onto the column, and the wash solution was recovered. The same treatment was repeated once. Recovered solutions were combined together to give a T cell fraction. After centrifugation of the T cell fraction , cells were re-suspended in PBS. Cell count of the resulting T cells was determined by using a hemacytometer. The cells were used in the following assay.  Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)<br>
As described above, two signaling pathways one between CD28 and CD80 (B7-1)/CD86(B7-2) and the other between CTLA4 and CD80 (B7-1) /CD86 (B7-2) , for which comparatively detailed analysis have been previously made, are known as costimulatory signaling pathways required for the activation of lymphocytes such as T cell, etc.<br>
Namely, the proliferation of T cell in response to mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) can be induced by the signal transduction through each of the two known pathways.<br>
Thus, by using the substances indicated below, test of this invention was conducted to analyze (1) the inhibition of MLRby blocking the CTLA4-mediated signaling pathway; (2) the inhibition of MLR by blocking the CD80 (B7-1) /CD86 (B7-2)-mediated signaling pathway; (3) the inhibition of MLR by blocking both CTLA4-mediated pathway and CD80 (B7-1)/CD86 (B7-2)-mediatedsignalingpathway; (4) the inhibition of MLR by blocking the tertiary signaling pathway associated with AILIM; and (5) the inhibition of MLR by blocking both CTLA4-mediated pathway and AILIM-mediated pathway.<br>
Following test substances were used.<br><br>
(1)	Human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (prepared in the Example described above) ;<br>
(2)	Mouse anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody SA12 (same as in the above Example);<br>
(3)	Human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody (negative control; same as in the above Example);<br>
(4)	Mouse IgG antibody (anti-human CD34; negative control; Immunotech);<br>
(5)	A mixture of anti-human CD80 monoclonal antibody<br>
(Pharmingen) and anti-human CD86 monoclonal antibody (Pharroingen) ;<br>
and<br>
(6)	Human CTLA4-IgFc chimera molecule (Ancell).<br>
Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was conducted on the following 6 combinations using PBMCs and T cells prepared from the donors described above in .<br>
(i) T cell (donor A) /PBMC (donor D)<br>
(ii) T cell  (donor D) /PBMC (donor B)<br>
(iii) T cell  (donor C) /PBMC (donor A)<br>
(iv) T cell  (donor E) /PBMC (donor G)<br>
(v) T cell  (donor F) /PBMC (donor E)<br>
(vi) T cell (donor G) /PBMC (donor F)<br>
The concentrations of PBMCs and T cells to be used in the test were adjusted as described below;<br>
PBMCs were suspended in PBS, and then transferred into culture dishes (60 mm) . The cells were subjected to X-ray irradiation (50 Gy) with an irradiator (Hitachi MEDICO). Cells were recovered, centrifuged and then added to PRMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Cell count was adjusted to 2Xio^ cells/50|Xl.<br>
Resulting T cells from each donor were also added to PRMI1640<br>
medium containing 10% FCS and the cell count was adjusted to IX10^ cells/50nl.<br> Inhibition of MLRby human anti-human AILIMmonoclonal antibody PRMI1640 medium containing' 10% FCS was added to each well of a 96-well microplate having U-shaped wells. A solution of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody or mouse anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody SA12 was diluted with PRMI1640 medium containing<br><br>
10% FCS to prepare solutions with various concentrations of the antibody. Diluted antibody solutions were added to the wells (final concentration: 0, 0.31, 1.25, 5 and 20|J,g/ml) . Subsequently, T cells (50|Lil) were added to the wells. The plate was incubated at SV'C for 1 hour in a CO2 incubator (NAPCO) . After the reaction was completed, PBMCs (SOfll) derived from a different donor were added to the wells to initiate MLR.<br>
When MLR vias conducted using an antibody other than human anti-human AILIM antibody (described above in (3) to (6)) as the test substance, T cells derived from a different donor were allowed to react after the incubation of PBMCs with the test substance.<br>
On the fifth day of the culture, tritium-labeled thymidine<br>
(^H-Thymidine; 20^.1; lp,Ci/well) diluted with PRMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS was added to each well. Cultivation was continued for one day. After the culture was com.pieted, the cells were harvested using a Cell Harvester (Packard) . Radioactivity of ^H incorporated of the cells was measured in a p-counter (TOP COUNT; Packard) to analyze the rate of T cell proliferation after the culture.<br>
Results are shown in Figures 48 to 59.  Inhibition of MLRby human anti-human AILIMmonoclonal antibody in MLR system where CTLA4-mediated signaling pathway has been previously blocked<br>
PRMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS was added to each well of a 96-well microplate having U-shaped wells. A solution of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody or mouse anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody SA12 was diluted with PRMI1540 medium containing 10% FCS to prepare solutions with various concentrations of the antibody. The diluted antibody solutions were added to the wells (final concentration: 0, 0.31, 1.25, 5 and 20ng/ml). Subsequently, T cells<br>
(SOfll) were added to the wells. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour in a CO2 incubator (NAPCO).<br>
In addition to the culture of the T cells, PBMCs (in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS) derived from other donors were cultured independently after adding human CTLA4-lgFc to the PBMCs. Cultivation was performed at 37 "C for 1 hour in a CO2 incubator (NAPCO) . Concentration of CTLA4-IgFc was adjusted to 20[ig/ml at the start of<br><br>
the MLR.<br>
Subsequently, PBMCs (50)11) were added to the T cell culture described above to initiate MLR.<br>
When MLR was conducted using an antibody other than human anti-human AILIM antibody (described above in (3) to (5)) as the test substance, T cells derived from a different donor were allowed to react after the incubation of PBMCs, which had been cultured in the presence of CTLA4-IgFc, with the test substance.<br>
On the fifth day of the culture, tritium-labeled thymidine (^H-Thymidine; 20p,l; l^lCi/well) diluted with PRMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS was added to each well. Cultivation was continued for one day. After the culture was completed, the cells were harvested by using a Cell Harvester (Packard) . Radioactivity of ^H incorporated of the cells was measured in a p-counter (TOP COUNT ; Packard) to analyze the rate of T cell proliferation after the culture.<br>
Results are shown in Figures 6 0 to 69.<br>
The results obtained from the two tests described above are summarized as follows:<br>
(1)	CTLA4-IgFc blocks the CTLA-4-mediated signal transduction, and thereby inhibiting the allogenic MLR-induced proliferation of T cell.<br>
(2)	Anti-CD80 antibody and anti-CD86 antibody inhibit the signal transduction mediated by CD80/CD86, which is a ligand for CTLA4 and CD2B , and thereby inhibiting the allogenic MLR-induced proliferation of T cell.<br>
(3)	A monoclonal antibody against human AILIM, like CTLA4-IgFc, anti-CD80 antibody and anti-CD86 antibody, significantly inhibits the allogenic MLR-induced T cell proliferation associated with the AILIM-mediated signal transduction in an antibody concentration-dependent manner.<br>
In other words, these results show that a tertiary pathway mediated by AILIM and the ligand thereof in addition to the known pathways mediated by CTLA4/CD80/CD86 and mediated by CD28/CD80/CD86 exist'as a costimulatory signaling pathways required for T cell activation, as well as that the AILIM-mediated signaling pathway is inhibited by antibody against AILIM.<br><br>
Furthermore, it raises the possibility that contribution of AILlM-mediated pathway to the signal transduction may be comparable to those of CTLA4/CD80/CD8 6-mediated pathway and CD28/CD80/CD86-mediated pathway.<br>
Example 9 Activity of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody to induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)<br>
Biological activities caused by antibodies include induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is a cytotoxic action that requires the antibody in addition to effector cells and target cells , that induces damage on the target cells induced by the effector cells such as lymphocyte, macrophage or polymorphonuclear leucocyte.<br>
The activity of the anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody of the present invention to induce ADCC was analyzed as follows:<br>
^^Cr (0.1 mCi/10^ cells; Amersham-Pharmacia) was added to the culture of human AILIM-overexpressing recombinant HPB-ALL cells prepared in the Example described above , and the mixture was incubated at37°C for 2 hours. The cells were washed 8 times with RPMI1640 medium. The isotope-labeled cells obtained were used as target cells.<br>
Control experiments were performedu sing wild-type human HPB-ALL cells labeled with the isotope as control cells in the same manner as described above.<br>
By using Lymphosepar I (IBL), PBMC fractions were separated from peripheral blood collected from normal healthy persons. The resulting human PBMCs were used as effector cells.<br>
The target cells (1x10^ cells/well; ZS^l/well) were plated on each well of a 9 6-well microplate (Nunc) having U-shaped wells. Subsequently, any one of various concentrations of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies diluted with RPMI1640 medium containing 5% FBS (0.0001-1.0|Xg/ml; 25M,l/well) , the medium alone (25M,l/well) or 1% Nonidet P-40 (25|Xl/well; detergent having cell-lysing activity) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes.<br>
Cultivation was carried out using anti-human CDS monoclonal antibody 0KT3 (ATCC CRL-8001) as a positive control antibody instead<br><br>
of anti-human AILIM antibody in the same manner as described above.<br>
Subsequently, the effector cells (E/T ratio=50; Ixio^ cells/well; 50|J.l/well) were added to each well and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 16 hours under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in an incubator.<br>
After cultivation, samples were centrifuged (at l,500rpm at 4 °C for 10 minutes). Resulting supernatant was recovered. Radioactivity in the centrifugal supernatant was measured by a<br>
y-counter. The radioactivity represents the amount of ^^Cr released from the cells into the culture supernatant by the damage of cell membrane by ADCC.<br>
Percentage of cell membrane damage (percentage cell lysis) , which was caused by ADCC induced by anti-AILIM antibody or anti-CD3 antibody, was determined under an assumption that the radioactivity observed with the medium alone corresponds to 0% with respect to the cell membrane damage (0) and that with Nonidet corresponds to 100% with respect to the cell membrane damage.<br>
Results are shown in Figures 70 and 71.<br>
The result of the test showed that human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody of the present invention exhibited ADCC-inducing activity in a concentration-dependent manner.<br>
Example 10 Determination of gene and amino acid sequences of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody and analysis of the same<br>
Sequences of cDNAs encoding the heavy chains as well as cDNAs encoding the light chains of various human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies, which had been prepared in the Example described above, were determined as described below. Structural features of the genes were also analyzed.<br>
By using Quick Prep mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham-Pharmacia) , PolyA^RNAs were extracted and purified from each of hybridomas (clones: AIH5D3 (JMab-136) , AiI289 (JMab-138) and AII394 (JMab-139)), which produce human monoclonal antibody against human AILIM prepared in the Example described above.<br>
The hybridoma cells were suspended in a cell lysis buffer (Lysis Buffer) , and lysed by using a syringe to solubilize them. Oligo (dT)<br><br>
resin was added to the solubilized material and the mixture was shaken gently. Subsequently, Oligo (dT) resin was washed, and then PolyA'^RNA was eluted with Elution Buffer. Eluted PolyA^RNA was precipitated with ethanol, and then dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. Concentration of PolyA*RNA obtained was determined by absorbance at a wavelength of 260nm.<br>
Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized by using PolyA*RNA as a template according to M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase method using a commercially available cDNA synthesis kit (GIBCOBRL) and synthetic oligo DNA Notl-T (SEQ ID NO: 1) as a primer.<br>
Specifically, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized in a solution<br>
(about 50|Xl) containing PolyA*RNA (about 5^g) purified from the hybridomas as a template, the primer (about 400 praole) andM-MLV Reverse<br>
Transcriptase at sy'C fori hour. Subsequently, dNTP, DNA polymerase I, RNaseH, DNA ligase, buffer and distilled water were added to the<br>
reaction solution (4p.l) , and the mixture was incubated at 16°C for 2 hours to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. The resulting double-stranded cDNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol.<br>
Subsequently, EcoRI linker DNA (about 300 pmole) and DNA ligase (Ligation High; 33|Xl; TOYOBO) was added to the solution containing the double-stranded cDNA in TE buffer (about 50^11) and the mixture was incubated at 16"^ for about 80 minutes to ligate the cDNA with the linker DNA. The linker DNA used was a double-stranded DNA consisting of oligo DNA (20adp; SEQ ID NO: 2) and oligo DNA (24adp; SEQ ID NO: 3) , which had been 5 '-phosphorylated and annealed to each other by a commonly used method.<br>
The DNA ligate was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and then precipitated with ethanol. Subsequently, the DNA reactant was digested with a commercially available restriction enzyme NotI (TOYOBO), and then incubated with a commercially available ATP solution (GIBCO BRL) and T4 kinase (TOYOBO) at 37°C for 30 minutes to phosphorylate the 5' end thereof.<br>
The resulting DNA was precipitated with ethanol-, and then fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A piece of gel containing DNA of about SOObp to20 00bp was cut out.  Cutting of the<br><br>
gel was carried out while the DNA stained with ethidium bromide was being visualized by irradiating UV light in a photographic device.<br>
The gel cut off was crushed and then suspended in TE buffer. The suspension was centrifuged and the resulting supernatant was recovered.<br>
The DNA recovered was ligated to a commercially available lambda phage vector A,EXcell (0.25|Llg; Amersham Pharmacia) in the presence of commercially available DNA Ligase (Ligation High; TOYOBO) (at le^C for 30 minutes) . In the next step, the DNA ligate was packaged into lambda phage using a commercially available lambda phage packaging kit Gigapack III Gold (STRATAGENE) and the resulting phage particles were infected to E. coli NM522 as a host to prepare a cDNA library. All the manipulations were carried out according to the experimental protocol attached to the kit.<br>
Subsequently, the cDNA library was screened by a plaque hybridization method (Maniatis et al., "Molecular Cloning: A Labolatory Manual, " Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York) as follows:<br>
The cDNA library (1x10* plaques) was plated on agar plates and replica filters thereof were prepared by using Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia) . These replica filters were subjected to hybridization treatment using probes labeled by using y^^P-ATP in a hybridization buffer according to the plaque hybridization method. Probes used were HIGLC (SEQ ID NO: 4) for antibody light chain and NHCc2 (SEQIDNO: 5) for antibody heavy chain. Single-plaque isolation was carried out from the positive clones obtained in the primary screening and secondary screening.<br>
Each of heavy chain and light chain of the antibody was amplified by PCR using a single PCR primer and Taq PCR kit (TAKARA) by utilizing phage suspension from each positive clone as a template DNA. A pair of primers used for antibody light chain were ExcellE (SEQ ID NO: 6) and ckll7 (SEQ ID NO: 7) , and a pair of primers used for antibody heavy chain were ExcellE (SEQ ID NO: 6) and NHCc2 (SEQ ID NO: 5). The resulting PCR products were fractionated according to a usual method using agarose gel electrophoresis. Pieces of gel containing DNAs of about SOObp corresponding to the heavy chain and light chain<br><br>
were cut out.  Nucleotide sequences of the DNAs purified from the gel were analyzedby using a DNA Sequencer (373A; PE-AppliedBiosystems) , ABI PRISM Sequencing Software (PE-Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM Auto Assembler (PE-Applied Biosystems) . DNA from each positive clone was verified to have sufficient length of nucleotide sequence.<br>
A.Phage from the plaque of each positive clone was infected to E. coli NP66 for in-vivo excision of plasmid DNA of interest, and the resulting filamentous phages were plated on ampicillin-containing plates to give colonies. Subsequently, plasmid DNAs were recovered and purified from the colonies by a commonly used method, and E. coli JM109 was transformed with the plasmids. Subsequently, the transformed cells were plated on ampicillin-containing nutrient agar plates to form colonies.<br>
Subsequently, bacterial suspension in ampicillin-containing LB medium derived from each colony was transferred to a liquid nutrient medium and the bacteria were cultured at 37°C for 24 hours. The bacteria were harvested from the culture, and then the plasmid DNA was purified by a plasmid purification kit (Quiagen) . Each of the plasmid DNAs was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI/NotI to verify the presence of vector DNA and insert DNA (heavy chain cDNA or light chain cDNA).<br>
Each nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding heavy chain and<br>
antibody light chain of the antibody, which was inserted in each purified<br>
plasmid, was determined by a commonly used method using DNA Sequencer<br>
(377A;  PE-Applied Biosystems), ABI PRISM Sequencing Software<br>
(PE-Applied Biosystems) and ABI PRISM Auto Assembler (PE-Applied<br>
Biosystems).<br>
Primers used for the sequence determination were as follows: <primers used for the determination of heavy chain cdna><br>

Example 11 Inhibitory effect of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody on delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)<br>
The biological system of immune response, the function of which is to eliminate harmful antigens (pathogenic microorganisms such as virus, bacterium and parasite, foreignbody, etc.) to the livingbodies , and can be broadly divided into congenital immunity and acquired immunity.<br><br>
The former is a system of elimination based on non-specific recognition including phagocytosis by phagocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocyte, monocyte, macrophage, etc.) , attack by natural killer (NK) cells, and opsonization of antigen by complement, etc.<br>
The latter, acquired immune response, is a system of elimination by lymphocytes (mainly, T cell and B cell) which acquired specificity (activation) to the antigen.<br>
Further, acquired immune response can broadly be divided into cellular immunity and humoral immunity.<br>
Unlike antibody-dependent humoral immunity, cellular immunity is an immune response expressed in general by the direct action of T cell on an antigen as the target. Cellular immunity is known to be involved in immune response to virus or tumor, immune response induced after transplantation of tissue or organ, hypersensitivity to some drugs, and some of autoimmune diseases.<br>
Most typical phenomenon belonging to cellular immunity is the well-known tuberculin allergy (almost synonymous with tuberculin hypersensitivity). Tuberculin allergy is a delayed allergy triggered by the infection by tubercle bacillus. The allergy is due to the infection by tubercle bacillus and can be induced by causing immune response by intracutaneously injecting, to a living body, tuberculin protein produced in culture supernatant of tubercle bacillus.<br>
Delayed allergy is an allergy mediated by T cell (memory T cell memorizing antigen) sensitizedwith an antigen. The allergy is called "delayed type," because it takes 24 to 48 hours for a living body sensitized with the antigen to express allergic response with inflammation induced by the memory T cell when contacted again with the antigen.<br>
The phenomenon of tuberculin allergy, which is a representative of delayed allergies, has generally been utilized in ^'tuberculin test" to diagnose whether or not sensitization by the infection of tubercle bacillus has already been established in an animal. Specifically, the test is conducted as follows: purified tuberculin (purified protein derivative; PPD; 0.1ml of the derivative of 0.05ng/0.1ml (2.5TU) for general diagnostic use), which is tuberculin protein<br><br>
purified from the culture of tubercle bacillus, is intracutaneously given to an animal; the major axis of skin redness at the injection site is measured 48 hours after the injection; and the presence of infection of tubercle bacillus can be diagnosed based on the major axis measured. If the major axis of the redness is shorter than 4mm, then the subject is negative; if it is within the range of 4-9mm then the subject is false positive; and if it is 10mm or longer then the subject is decided positive.<br>
Delayed allergies associated with cellular immunity include, for example, Jones-Mote type hypersensitivity transiently induced by a small amount of protein or the like, contact allergy to drugs such as picryl chloride or plant toxins such as Japanese lacquer, or allergy associated with graft rejection (e.g., allogenic graft) as well as the above-mentioned allergy to antigen from infectious pathogen such as tuberculin allergy caused by tubercle bacillus described above.<br>
In this test, the inhibitory effect of anti-AILIM antibody on delayed-type hypersensitivity (delayed allergy) was evaluated by utilizing the above-mentioned tuberculin test. The test was conducted as follows:<br>
Each of cynomolgus monkeyj (male, body weight: 6.0-8.5kg, Environmental Biological Life Science Research Center Inc.; 3 individuals in each group) , which had been sensitized with BCG (Bacille de Calmette et Guerin) , which is an attenuated live bacteriiira of bovine-type tubercle bacillus, was anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (lOmg/kg, intramuscular injection) , and then any one of the test samples indicated below was intracutaneously given with a quantity of 0,1ml to each injection site (6 injection sites/individual) in the chest. The distances between the injection sites of the sample were 3 cm or longer.<br>
(1)	1:1 mixed solution of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal<br>
antibody (JMab-136; O.Zmg; lOUg at each injection site) and tuberculin<br>
(4|ig/lml of physiological saline} ;<br>
(2)	1:1 mixed solution of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal<br>
antibody (JMab-136; 2mg; 100|j,g at each injection site) and tuberculin (4|lg/lml of physiological saline) ;<br><br>
(3)	phosphate buffer (PBS (-) ) as a control;<br>
(4)	1:1 mixed solution of a commercially available steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, Prednisolone (0.2mg; lO^lg at each injection site) and tuberculin (4|Llg/lml of physiological saline) as a positive control;<br>
(5)	1:1 mixed solution of human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody (Example ; 0.2mg; 10|Jlg at each injection site) and tuberculin (4jig/lml of physiological saline) as a negative control.<br>
24 hours after injection of each sample, the major axis and minor axis of redness at each inj ection site were measured to determine the area of the redness.<br>
The result is shown in Figure 72.<br>
The result showed that redness due to delayed allergy was significantly inhibited in any groups subjected to injection of the anti-AILIM antibodies, as compared with the control and negative control groups. The inhibitory effect was comparable to that of the steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used as a positive control.<br>
Example 12 Analysis for the expression of AILIM in various tissues of patients with graft versus host disease (GVHD)<br>
Expression of AILIM in a variety of tissues obtained of biopsy from patients, who were recipients subjected to transplantation of allogenic graft from donors and had been diagnosed clinically to be affected with acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) after the transplantation, was analyzed by a commonly used method. Tissues were stained with HE and human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (JMab-36) prepared in the Example described above.<br>
Analysis was carried out using 33 samples form various tissues collected from acute GVHD patients (28 cases) as well as 5 samples from chronic GVHD patient (5 cases).<br>
Results were as follows: AILIM-positive reaction was found in 15 of 29 samples of skin tissue; in 1 of 3 samples of stomach tissue; and in 1 of 1 sample of colon tissue; which were all obtained from acute GVHD patients. AILIM-positive reaction was found in 1 of 3 samples of skin tissue; in 2 of 2 samples of colon tissue; which were all obtained from chronic GVHD patients.  Further, AILIM-positive<br><br>
reaction was found in 10 of 13 samples in which significant lymphocyte infiltration had been observed.<br>
Example 13 Activity of human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody to transduce costimulatory signal in monkey T cell<br>
The experiment conducted in Example 7 has demonstrated that the human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are capable of enhancing the proliferation of human T cell via controlling the human T cell response, specifically, controlling the transduction of AILIM-mediated costimulatory signal to the cell. In this test, it was analyzed whether or not the human monoclonal antibodies exhibit activity of enhancing cell proliferation of monkey T cell by the same method as described in Example 7.  Dilution of antibody<br>
Anti-human CDS monoclonal antibody SP34 (BD-Pharmingen) was<br>
diluted with phosphate buffer (PBS) to a final concentration of Ifig/ml. The above-prepared human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody<br>
JMAbl35 was diluted with PBS to a final concentration of 40lig/ml. The antibody solutions were further diluted with PBS to prepare various concentrations of antibodies (40|J.g/ml-0. 064|ig/ml) .  Coating of microplate with antibody<br>
Each well of 96-well microplates was coated with anti-human CDS monoclonal antibody SP34 (lp.g/ml; 25^11 to each well) and the human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody JMAblSS (40llg/ml-0.064ng/ml; 25)Xl to each well) . The plates were incubated at 37*0 for 2 hours. Subsequently, the antibody solutions were discarded, and each well was washed 3 times with PBS. After the wash, RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS was added to each well (lOOHl/well) , and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Thus respective wells of the plates were coated with the antibodies mentioned above.<br>
Control experiments were carried out in the same manner using plates coated with human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody (JMab23; see the previous Examples) as control antibodies instead of the human anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibodies.<br>
The microplates coated with the antibodies were used in the following assays.<br><br>  Preparation  of monkey  T   cell  suspension<br>
Peripheral blood was collected from cynomolgus monkeys and mononuclear cells were fractionatedby density gradient centrifugation using NycoPrepl. 077A (Nycomed) . According to the experimental manual, monkey T cells were separated from the cynomolgus monkey mononuclear cells by using anti-human CD4 antibody M-T477 (BD-Pharmingen) , anti-human CDS antibody RPA-T8 (BD-Pha2:mingen) , anti-mouse IgG microbead (Miltenyi) and a Magnetic Sorter. T cell count was determined using a hemacytometer. Monkey T cells were suspended in RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Thus monkey T cell suspension (1x10^ cell /ml) vras prepared.  Cell culture<br>

Simian T cell suspension was added to each well of a microplate coated with the antibody mentioned above and the plate was incubated at   37°C for 2  days  in  a  CO2   incubator.<br>
After the culture was  completed,  respective microplates were used  in  the  following assays:  Determination of proliferation activity of  T  cell<br>
Methyl [^H] thymidine (0 . 5p,Ci/well; Amersham-Pharmacia) was added to each well of the plates after incubation, and the plates were incubated at 3 7°C for 5 hours in a CO2 incubator. After incubation, the cells were trapped on GF/C filters (Packard) by using a Cell Harvester. Subsequently, the filters were dried at 40°C for 3 hours or longer, andthenMicroscinti 0 (2 Ofll/well; Packard) was added thereto. Radioactivity of ^H incorporated in the cells trapped on the filters was measured by a p-counter (TOP COUNT) to analyze the degree of T cell proliferation after the  culture.<br>
The  result is  shown in Figures  73.<br>
The result of this assay showed that simian T cells were significantly proliferated depending on the concentration of the cells when microplates were coated with anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (human monoclonal antibody or mouse monoclonal antibody) together with  anti-human  CD3  antibody.<br>
The   result   also   suggests   that   the   human   anti-human   AILIM<br><br>
monoclonal antibodies of the present invention can bind to monkey AILIM and have the activity to regulate the function of monkey AILIM.<br>
Example 14 Establishment of method for identifying and quantifying substances capable of binding to AILIM or AILIM ligand<br>
A method of ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immuno solvent assay) was established to identify or quantify a substance capable of binding to AILIM (ICOS) or AILIM ligand (B7h/B7RPl/GL50/LICOS).<br>
The principle of the method described below in detail as an example is based on estimating, by ELISA, the degree of inhibition on the binding between soluble human AILIM (hAILIM-IgFc) and soluble human AILIM ligand (hB7h-IgFc) caused by the substance.  Sample<br>
The following samples were used:<br>
(1)	Streptavidin-HRP (Southern Biotechnology Associates,<br>
Inc.);<br>
(2)	Soluble human AILIM ligand (fusion protein between the<br>
extracellular region of human B7h and the constant region of human<br>
IgGl);<br>
The protein was prepared by the method described below in ;<br>
(3)	Biotin-labeled soluble AILIM-IgFc;<br>
The AILIM-IgFc was prepared by further purifying the antigen obtained according to the same method as described in earlier applications (JP-A 11-29599 (Example 16 (2) ) and W098/38216 (Example 16 (2))) of one of the present inventors, Tezuka;<br>

(hB7h-IgFc) of the extracellular region of human B7h and the constant region of human IgGl)<br>
Total RNA was prepared from human peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells in the same manner as described in the Example above. cDNA was synthesized from the obtained total RNA (5|j,g) as a template and by using Superscript Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (GIBCO-BRL).<br>
Subsequently,	5'primer<br>
(5'-GAGGTCTCCGCCCTCGAGATGCGGCTGGGCAGTCC-3', SEQ ID NO: 39) having Xhol        restriction        site        and        3'primer<br>
(5'-CACAGGACAGCCAGGGGATCCCACGTGGCCGCG-3' , SEQIDNO: 40) havingBamHI restriction site at their respective ends were designed and synthesized to amplify cDNA encoding the extracellular region of human AILIM ligand<br>
(hB7h) by PCR. By using the cDNA as a template and the primer pair, PCR was conducted to prepare a DNA having Xhol and BamHl at respective ends thereof containing cDNA encoding the extracellular region of human B7h. The resulting PCR products were digested with Xhol and BamHI, and fractioned by agarose gel electrophoresis to isolate a band corresponding to about 720-bp cDNA fragment, that was predicted to encode the extracellular region of interest. The isolated cDNA fragment was subcloned into plasmid pBluescript II SK ( + ) (Stratagene) pre-digested with Xhol and BamHI. It was verified that the cDNA fragment contained the portion encoding the extracellular region of human B7h by sequencing analysis using an automated fluorometric DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems).<br>
On the other hand, DNA encoding Fc of human IgGl as a fusion partner was prepared as a BamHI-Xbal DNA fragment (about 1.3kb) by digesting a plasmid (see. Cell, Vol.61, p.1303-1313, 1990; prepared by Dr. Seed et al. , at the Massachusetts General Hospital) with BamHI and Xbal. This fragment contained exons encoding the hinge regions<br>
of human IgGl, Cyl2, and CylS.<br>
The XhoI-BamHI fragment encoding the extracellular region of<br>
human B7h ( h. B7h) , and the BamHI-Xbal fragment containing exons encoding Fc (abbreviated as " igFc") of human IgGl, prepared as described above, were subcloned into a plasmid pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene) pre-digested with Xhol and Xbal.<br><br>
Subsequently, the plasmid was digested with Xhol and Xbal to prepare a DNA fragment about 1.8-kb containing fusion DNA between the extracellular region of human B7h and human IgFc. By using T4 DNA ligase, this fusion DNA fragment was inserted into an expression vector pMElSS (Medical Immunology, Vol.20, No.l, p.27-32, 1990, and "Handbook for Genetic Engineering, " Experimental Medicine, supplement, Yodosha, pp. 101-107, 1992) between Xhol and Xbal sites, to construct a plasmid phB7h-IgFc.<br>
Monolayer C0S7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) cultured to be sub-confluent in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and ampicillin, were transformed with the plasmid phB7h-IgFc by electroporation to yield transformed cells.<br>
The transformed cells were allowed to expresshB7h-IgFc by culturing them in serum-free ASF104 medium for 72 hours.<br>
HB7h-IgFc was purified by using a Protein G Sepharose affinity column  (Amersham Pharmacia) as follows:<br>
The above-mentioned culture supernatant was centrifuged to obtain centrifugal supernatant. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a Protein G Sepharose affinity column pre-equilibrated with a binding buffer. Subsequently, the column was washed with the binding buffer, and then elution was performed with an elution buffer. The eluted solution was recovered and then dialyzed against phosphate buffer. The outer dialyzing buffer was changed twice or more. Thus purified hB7h-IgFc was obtained.<br> Dilution of antibody and soluble human AILIM (hAILIM-IgFc) and reaction thereof<br>
Original solutions (20(Xg/ml) of anti-human AILIM monoclonal antibody (JMab-136) and human anti-KLH monoclonal antibody (JMab-23) as a negative control antibody were diluted in a series of 11 levels, and each sample (200|ll) was combined and mixed well with 200|ll of RPMI1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Thus various concentrations of antibody solutions were prepared. Biotin-labeled hAILIM-IgFc (2|il/tube; final concentration l|Jlg/ml) was added to each of the prepared solutions with various concentrations . The resulting solutions were mixed well and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br><br> Assay for the activity of anti-AILIM monoclonal antibody to inhibit the binding between hAILIM-IgFc and hB7h-IgFc<br>
hB7h-IgFc was added to each well of a 96-well microplate (50|Xl/well (800ng/well) ) . The plate was sealed and then incubated at 37'^ for 1 hour. Solution was removed from each well, and the wells were washed 3 times with PBS (120^1) . Subsequently, PBS containing 0.5% BSA (lOOjll/well) was added to each well to block the unreacted sites. The plate was sealed and incubated at 37*C for 1 hour. After incubation, the solution was removed, and then the wells were washed 3 times with PBS (120p.l) . Subsequently, each sample (50jll/well) prepared in  was added to the wells. The plate was sealed and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Solution was removed from each well. The wells were washed 3 times with RPMI16 40 medium containing 10% FCS (12 0^1) pre-heated at 37'C. Subsequently, PBS containing 3.7% formalin (100p,l/well) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated on ice for 5 minutes. Solution was removed from each well, and the wells were washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween20 (120^1) . Subsequently, Streptavidin-HRP {50\ll/viell) was added to each well. The plate was sealed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Solution was removed from each well, and the plate was washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween20 (120p,l) . Subsequently, TMB* substrate chroraogen (50|ll/well) was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. Subsequently, 2N sulfuric acid (SO^ll/well) was added to each well to stop the reaction. Absorbance of each well was measured at a wavelength of 450nm by a THERMO max (Molecular Devices).<br>
Results are shown in Figures 74 to 76.<br>
The results showed that anti-AILIM antibody had the activity of inhibiting the binding between hAILIM-IgFc and hB7h-IgFc in a dosage-dependent manner.<br>
Accordingly, this Example indicates that an assay system illustrated by the present method can be utilized to screen and identify substances capable of binding to AILIM or AILIM ligand (for example, antibody or synthetic low molecular weight compound) .<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
The human monoclonal antibodies of the invention capable of binding to human AILIM are of human origin, and therefore these antibody induces no serious immunorej ection due to antigenicity to human, i.e., KAMA (Human anti-mouse antigenicity) in a host, which has been a serious therapeutic problem (side effect) in antibody pharmaceutical preparations comprising non-human mammal-derived antibody such as mouse-derived antibody. The antibody of the invention is thus of great value as an antibody pharmaceutical.<br>
Thus, the h\aman monoclonal antibody of the invention against AILIM (particularly human AILIM) and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the human monoclonal antibody do not induce host immunorej ection caused by HAMA at all; and thus can be used as pharmaceutical preparations capable of controlling a variety of biological reactions (e.g. , proliferation of cells expressing AILIM, cytokine production by AILIM-expressing cells, immune cytolysis or cell death (apoptosis) of cells cixpressing AILIM, and activity of inducing antibody-dependent damage of cells expressing AILIM) associated with the transduction of AILIM-mediated costimulatory signal (secondary signal) to cells expressing AILIM; and/or can be used to treat or prevent various diseases associated with the transduction of the AILIM-mediated signal, controlling and inhibiting the onset and/or progress of the diseases.<br>
Specifically, by providing pharmaceutical preparations containing the human anti-AILIM monoclonal antibody of the invention or a portion thereof as an active ingredient, it is possible to inhibit<br><br>
or treat and prevent, for example, a variety of diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus as a chronic inflammatory skin disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and psoriasis, etc.) classified into autoimmune diseases or allergic diseases (particularly, autoimmune diseases and delayed allergies by cellular immunity); arthropathies (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , osteoarthritis (OA) ) , inflammation (e.g. , hepatitis) ; graft versus host reaction (GVH reaction) ; graft versus host disease (graft versus host disease; GVHD) ; immunorejection associated with transplantation (allogenic graft or heterogenous graft) of tissues (tissues such as skin, cornea and bone) or organs (liver, heart, lung, kidney, pancreas, etc.); immune response to foreign antigen or self antigen (for example, production of antibody against the antigen, cell proliferation, cytokine production, etc.); and diseases that are potentially caused by abnormality in gut immunity (specifically, inflammatory bowel disease (particularly, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); and alimentary allergy, etc.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention make it possible to treat or prevent some inflammations for which various steroidal drugs are used as anti-inflammatory drugs , for example, inflammation associated with various arthritides (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, etc.), pneumonia, hepatitis (including viral hepatitis) , inflammation associated with infectious diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, enteritis, nephritis (glomerular nephritis, inflammation associated with kidney fibrosis, gastritis, vasculitis, pancreatitis, peritonitis, bronchitis, myocarditis, encephalitis, inflammation associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury (myocaridial ischemia-reperfusion injury, etc.), inflammation associated with immunorejection after transplantation of tissues or organs, scald, various skin inflammations (psoriasis, allergic contact dermatitis , lichen planus as a chronic inflammatory skin disease) , inflammation associated with multiple organ failure, inflammation after operation of PTCA or PTCR, and inflammation associated with atherosclerosis, autoimmune thyroiditis, etc.<br><br>
In addition, with respect to the above-mentioned inhibition and treatment of immunorejection associated with transplantation of tissues or organs as described above, the pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention can be used in conjunction with known immunosuppressant used to inhibit the immunorejection in transplantation therapy thereby increasing the effect of the known drug to inhibit the graft rejection.<br>
Further, by the use of the method of identifying substances capable of binding to AILIM or AILIM ligand, which is within the scope of the present invention, it is possible to control the signal transduction associated with the interaction between AILIM and AILIM ligand through the binding to AILIM or AILIM ligand, and thereby achieving screening and selection of pharmaceutical agents (synthetic chemical compound and antibody) having potential activity to treat the above-mentioned various diseases.<br>
