3.	A MEMS BASED ELECTROSTATIC ACOUSTIC<br>
TRANSDUCER AND METHODS THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
(0001)	The present invention in general relates to acoustic<br>
transducers and more particularly the present invention relates to Micro<br>
Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based electrostatic acoustic<br>
transducers and the methods of constructing the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(2)	A microphone is an acoustic transducer that changes information from one form to another. The information in the form of sound energy is taken as the input and the microphone delivers it as electrical signal at the output. The main pressure sensing element in the microphone is the acoustic transducer that converts the acoustic pressure into an electrical signal.<br>
(3)	A microphone typically includes a surface called a diaphragm that is configurable to vibrate in response to the sound wave inputs. The diaphragm is coupled to a circuitry, which translates the diaphragm vibrations into electrical signals, which are proportional to the sound waves. Microphones are of several types. Condenser microphone is one of the commonly encountered designs. In known designs, condenser type microphones use electrostatic capacitors, which consist of two thin parallel plates, one is movable (diaphragm) and the other fixed (backplate). The capacitance is determined by the surface area of the plates, the dielectric or the medium (air) between the plates and the distance between the plates (which changes in response to the acoustic pressure waves). The plates form a sound-pressure sensitive capacitor.<br><br>
(4)	In condenser microphones employing electrostatic transduction, the sound waves produce a vibration of the diaphragm. The diaphragm and backplate are conductive and connected to opposite sides of a DC power supply, which provides a polarizing voltage to the capacitor. When the microphone receives a sound-pressure wave, the distance between the plates or overlap area changes resulting in change in capacitance of the circuit. The change in capacitance causes a proportional voltage change. The circuitry connected to the diaphragm then generates an output electrical signal corresponding to the variation of the capacitance. These signals are then further amplified and processed as required. The capacitor so formed between the diaphragm and the backplate is part of an RC circuit.<br>
(5)	The specifications of a microphone are normally based on the factors like, sensitivity, overload characteristics, linearity or distortion, frequency and noise. Issues related to the above-mentioned factors needs to be addressed in designing the transducer and sensing element of the microphone. In general, the main focus of any proposed method should be at the most fundamental level of the sensing element, the diaphragm, which changes the entire design and hence performance as well as specifications of a microphone.<br>
(6)	Following the principle mentioned above, micro elctromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones are produced where one chip serves "as the membrane/diaphragm and the other as the electrode or backplate, together forming a capacitor. Silicon micro machining and MEMS provides the means to fabricate microphones with length scales ranging from micron to millimeters. Using batch fabrication techniques, hundreds or thousands of devices can be built on a single silicon wafer. This offers a significant per-unit cost reduction relative to conventional microphone technologies. A miniature sensor enables mounting in a confined space and/or in a cluster of array of sensors.<br><br>
(7)	The basic pressure sensing element inx a MEMS condenser microphone is a silicon membrane. The membrane is fixed at the edges. It vibrates under the applied acoustic pressure. The deflected shape of the membrane changes the electric field between the membrane and the backplate, which in turn, changes the capacitance between the two parallel plates. This change in the capacitance is used as the electrical signal generator.<br>
(8)	There are several unresolved technical problems associated with the known configurations of condenser type microphone. The first problem is that the deflection field of the membrane is non-uniform and, therefore, the change in the electrical field is non-uniform. Secondly, the relationship between the capacitance and the dynamic gap between the membrane and the backplate is non-linear and, therefore, cannot be scaled linearly in designs. The third issue is that the electrical field between the two plates opposes the motion of the membrane and thus acts as an additional damper. This phenomenon couples the electrical field and the mechanical field strongly because the movement of the diaphragm is parallel to the direction of the electrical field.<br>
(9)	Yet another deficiency in the known configurations is that there is not much control over the natural frequency of the structure and hence the range for flat frequency response (cut-off frequency) of the microphone. The natural frequency in the existing designs depends on the membrane geometry and the polarizing voltage. Although, the natural frequency of the membrane can be varied with polarizing voltage, there is a strong limitation on the polarizing voltage due to the critical pull-in-voltage.<br>
(10)	The present invention addresses the deficiency in the prior art configurations mentioned above and discloses a novel configuration of a MEMS Microphone having miniaturized acoustic transducer and methods of constructing the same.<br><br>

(23)	It is an aspect of this invention to configure aacoustic transducer wherein the movement of the vibrating plate with the concentric cylinders is'normal to the direction of electrical field thus eliminating any additional force that opposes the deflection of the vibrating plate, towards the backplate thereby uncoupling the electrical and mechanical fields.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
(42)	Fig 1 shows the basic configuration of a condenser microphone based on electrostatic acoustic transduction mechanism. The basic elements of the condenser microphone include the transducer elements in the form of a diaphragm 110 which is placed close to the backplate 120, a DC power source 130 connected to the diaphragm 110 and the backplate 120 and produces the electric potential between them and an amplifier 140. The backplate 120 is fixed. The arrangement of the diaphragm and the backplate acts as the parallel plate capacitor. With the application of the acoustic pressure waves 100 as an input, the diaphragm 110 deflects and moves towards the fixed backplate 120. The deflection of the diaphragm 110 changes the gap between the diaphragm 110 and the backplate 120 and thereby changing the electric field. Consequently the change in capacitance of the circuit is read out through an electronic circuitry in terms of the voltage change.<br>
(43)	Fig 2 shows the diaphragm (vibrating plate) 110 with a plurality of concentric cylinders 150a, 150b, ..150n attached with the diaphragm 110 of the acoustic pressure sensor. The diaphragm 110 is suspended on a plurality of beams 160 at one end and the other end of the beams 160 is fixed. The diaphragm is exposed to acoustic pressure 100 in the direction shown and the diaphragm 110 deflects in the direction of application of the acoustic pressure 100.<br>
(44)	Fig. 3(a) shows the overlapping of the concentric cylinders 150a&gt; 150b, »150n on the diaphragm 110 and the concentric cylinders 170a, 170bl-170n on the fixed backplate 120.<br><br>
(0045)	Fig 3 (b) shows the sectional view of the meshed<br>
overlapping of the concentric cylinders 150a, 150b, »150n on the diaphragm<br>
110 and the concentric cylinders 170a, 170b,~170n of the backplate 120. The<br>
set of conductive cylinders 150a, 150b,~150nand 170a&gt; 170b,~170n forms the<br>
cylindrical combdrives. lc is the length of the cylinders attached with the<br>
plates 110 and 120. The length of overlap 180 of the cylindrical faces 150<br>
and 170 in meshed configurations forms the cylindrical capacitance.<br>
(0046)	Fig 3(c) shows for a given number of concentric cylinders<br>
on the moving diaphragm 110 and the fixed backplate 120, the equivalent<br>
capacitance is the summation of the individual capacitances, which are in<br>
parallel configurations.<br>
(0047)	For a cylindrical geometry such as coaxial cylinders, the<br>
capacitance is given by:<br><br>
where 'a' is the inner radius, 'b' the outer radius, 7' the length of cylinder, and e0 is the permittivity of free space between the two cylindrical surfaces.<br>
(0048)	Let the initial overlap between the fixed and the moving<br>
cylindrical combdrives be lQ 180. The length of overlap of combdrives is<br>
determined by cylindrical capacitance arid is given by,<br><br>
where,  l0  ~ initial overlap of cylindrical combdrives attached to the<br>
diaphragm 110 and the backplate 120, l(t) = overlap at some instant *t\ x(t) = deflection of the plate on application of acoustic pressure.<br><br>
(0049)	For the given number of cylinders in xne comoanves on ine<br>
moving diaphragm 110 and the fixed backplate 120, the equivalent<br>
capacitance can be calculated as follows:<br><br>
j = 1, 2, 3, ...,n, No of cylinders;<br>
v\ = inner radius of the cylindrical combdrives;<br>
r0= outer radius of the cylindrical combdrives;<br>
fj = fixed cylinders attached with backplate of the microphone<br>
m, = moving cylinders attached with diaphragm of microphone<br>
CI, C2, ....C6 = Cylindrical capacitors formed between the fixed and<br>
moving combdrives<br>
C = Equivalent capacitance<br>
C(t) = Cl+C2+C3+	<br>
'n' no. of cylinders on the moving plate (diaphragm 110) create '2n' gaps among the overlapping surfaces. This accounts for '2w' cylindrical capacitors in parallel.    The calculations shown above forC(/)   for 3<br>
cylindrical combs on the diaphragm which gives rise to 6 cylindrical capacitances in parallel. The same can be extended to cn' no. of cylindrical combdrives and forming '2n' cylindrical capacitances, increase in number of cylindrical combdrives gives higher capacitance change and hence, better electrical sensitivity.<br>
(0050)	Fig 4(a) shows the suspension of the plate 110 with plurality<br>
of beams 160 fixed at one end. The sensing part 190 is configured in such<br>
a manner that it is not affected with the boundary condition of the beams<br>
160. Further in fig 4(b) it can be seen that there is uniform displacement of<br><br>
the sensing part 190 of the microphone due to sound pressure waves 100. Due to this particular configuration and uniform displacement of the sensing part, the change in electric field is also uniform.<br>
(51)	Fig 4(b) shows the deflected position of the diaphragm 110 on application of sound pressure waves 100. Deflection of sensing part 190 i.e. concentric cylinders 150a, 150b, »150n on 110 with respect to the applied acoustic pressure 100 is shown. The set of cylindrical capacitors 150 and 170 on 110 and 120 respectively forms the cylindrical comb drive, which is used as an electrostatic capacitive sensing element. The change in capacitance is due to the change in the area of overlap 180 between two concentric cylindrical faces. First, the incident acoustic pressure waves 100 force the bending of the diaphragm 110, inducing displacement normal to the z-direction, thus translating the acoustic energy to mechanical energy. Since one set of the cylindrical combdrives are attached to the moving diaphragm 110, the concentric cylinders move in and out of the other set of fixed cylindrical combdrives attached to the backplate 120, thus changing the length of overlap. Consequently, the change in area of overlap changes the capacitance. This change in capacitance causes a change in the output voltage, translating the mechanical energy into an electrical signal. The voltage modulation is detected through a fully active electronic circuit.<br>
(52)	Fig 4(c) shows the electric field between overlapped faces of the cylinders in meshed configuration. It can also be observed that the change in electric field due to deflection of the diaphragm is uniform. The electrostatic field is limited between the concentric cylindrical faces of the combdrives" 150 and 170 because there is no charge on the moving flat plates, the diaphragm 110 and the backplate 120. The displacement of the moving combs on the plate 110 that affects this electrostatic field is normal to the direction of the electric field 200 and therefore, the changes induced in the electrostatic field are only due to the much weaker fringing field effects. Thus, the electrostatic field remains nearly constant. Moreover, there is no additional force of opposition due to the electrical field in the<br><br>
direction parallel to the mechanical motion. This phenomenon uncouples the electrical and mechanical fields in the proposed invention.<br>
(53)	The change in capacitance is calculated due to change in area of overlap or the length of overlap between a set of cylindrical capacitor. The calculation of capacitance explained earlier shows a linear relationship between change in capacitance and deflection of the sensing element 110. One of the advantages due to this linear relationship is that larger mechanical displacement of the diaphragm 110 corresponding to higher acoustic pressure levels poses no problems.<br>
(54)	Fig 5 shows the mode shape in the first mode of vibration of the diaphragm 110. This particular method of configuring an acoustic transducer provides a range of variation in design. The natural frequency of the proposed structural configuration depends only on the mechanical properties and not on the bias voltage. The plates 110 and beams 160 can be designed in numerous ways to place the natural frequencies at any desired location without resorting to optimization, because the beam 160 and the plate 110 combination can almost decouple the mass and stiffness properties of the structure. The ability to place the natural frequency at any location gives a direct control over the flat response of the device. The desired flexibility can be obtained to tune the stiffness of the structure and hence, can get the desired sensitivity. This particular aspect is extremely helpful in designing a system of microphone array where each sensor can be tuned to respond to a narrow bandwidth of the acoustic spectrum with extremely high flatness and high sensitivity.<br>
(55)	Fig 6 illustrates further the design of the sensing element in membrane mode with cylindrical combdrives with the beam length reduced to zero. Apart from a beam-diaphragm combination, the sensing element can also be made as a complete membrane 110 by reducing the beam length to zero. It can be modeled as a membrane considering the same cylindrical combdrives 150, where the restoring forces in a membrane are the internal<br>
1 e&gt;<br><br>
stresses. The diaphragm deflection fw' in this case can be approximated by the following differential equation:<br><br>
(0056)	Fig.7 (a) &amp; 7(b) show the variation in configuration of the<br>
sensing element in terms of achieving high cut-off frequency with respect<br>
to the first resonant frequency. It can be observed from the figure that by<br>
varying the plate thickness (mass) and beam thickness (stiffness)<br>
independently, the desired resonant frequency can be achieved.<br>
(57)	Fig. 8 shows the linearity in design with the application at different sound pressure levels. The response is plotted against the sound pressure level on a logarithmic scale.<br>
(58)	While this invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments, it should be appreciated that the present,invention is not limited to those precise embodiments. Rather, in view of the present disclosure, which describes the current best mode for practicing the invention, many modifications and variations would present themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention.<br>
