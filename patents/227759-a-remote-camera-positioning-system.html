				<td>A REMOTE CAMERA POSITIONING SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to camera supports. More particularly, the invention relates<br>
to supports for remotely positioning cameras.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In cinema graphic and other visual art endeavors, it is often desired to increase the<br>
range of viewing perspectives, to obtain various special effects and capture scenes from<br>
angles and elevations that are not available from a camera on a tripod or held by a camera<br>
man. This is particularly true in the recording of sporting events. Various systems have<br>
been developed to address these goals, including elevating and pivoting boom arms, as<br>
shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,849,778, and steady cam mounts for aircraft, as<br>
shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,156,512.<br>
While these approaches do increase the range of viewing angles and elevations,<br>
they often involve complicated componentry that is typically difficult to operate by a<br>
cameraman alone and is almost certainly too large to be held and maneuvered by a<br>
cameraman alone. The size and weight of the equipment often limits access to desired<br>
viewing and recording areas.<br>
It would therefore be advantageous to provide a remote camera positioning<br>
system that is capable of being supported, operated and maneuvered by a sole<br>
cameraman.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subject matter of the invention presents various features that can be combined<br>
in different combinations and with varying degrees of details to provide improvements to<br>
a remote camera positioning and control system. The various combinations of features<br>
preferably provide a remote camera positioner that can used and supported by a sole<br>
operator with no external structural or personnel support. With certain combinations of<br>
features, a remote camera positioner can be arranged that is controlled and physically<br>
supported only through the operator's hands, with auxiliary systems, such as power<br>
supplies, video monitoring and video recorder being mounted on the user.<br>
It is desirable for a remote camera positioning system having features according<br>
to aspects of the invention to be sufficiently light-weight to be borne and readily<br>
maneuvered by a sole operator, but have sufficient flexural rigidity to resist the various<br>
deflections that can be induced by loads created with the camera movements and by<br>
external forces. Various combinations of features according to principles of the invention<br>
can provide a balance between such light-weightness and flexural rigidity to enable sole<br>
operator use and control in a self-contained manner.<br>
One embodiment having a combination of features according to aspects of the<br>
invention is a remote camera positioning system for use and support by a sole operator,<br>
having a camera positioner with a distal camera mount for supporting a camera, a camera<br>
positioner having a proximal operator interface to enable an operator to support a camera<br>
positioner and spatially maneuver the camera through the camera positioner, wherein the<br>
positioner includes at least one elongated beam module. The beam module of this<br>
embodiment is positioned distally of the operator interface and proximally of the camera<br><br>
mount and has a plurality of discrete longerons radially displaced from the neutral axis of<br>
the beam module and extending substantially parallel to the neutral axis. In this<br>
embodiment, the cross-sectional flexural rigidity of the beam module decreases distally<br>
toward the camera from a first cross-sectional flexural rigidity to a second cross-sectional<br>
flexural rigidity.<br>
In another embodiment, the cross-sectional flexural rigidity of the beam module<br>
increases distally to a third cross-sectional flexural rigidity that is greater than said<br>
second cross-sectional flexural rigidity and then decreases distally to a fourth cross-<br>
sectional flexural rigidity. In another variation of combined features, the first cross-<br>
sectional flexural rigidity and the third cross-sectional flexural rigidity can be<br>
substantially the same and the second cross-sectional flexural rigidity and the fourth<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity can be substantially equal. Still another possibility is that<br>
the first cross-sectional flexural rigidity is greater than the third cross-sectional flexural<br>
rigidity, and optionally, at the same time, the second cross-sectional flexural rigidity can<br>
be greater than the fourth cross-sectional flexural rigidity.<br>
In another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention, the<br>
beam module can include, instead of just one beam module, multiple beam modules, for<br>
example, a proximal beam module and a separate distal beam module. In such an<br>
arrangement, the first cross-sectional flexural rigidity and the second cross-sectional<br>
flexural rigidity could occur along the length of the proximal beam module and the third<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity and the fourth cross-sectional flexural rigidity could<br>
occur along the length of the distal beam module.<br><br>
Another feature according to aspects of the invention is that at least one of the<br>
multiple beam modules can have an anchor brace region and a stabilizing web region.<br>
The anchor brace region can include at least one anchor brace extending substantially<br>
longitudinally and transversely joining adjacent ones of the plurality of longerons, and<br>
me stabilizing web region can include at least one stabilizing web extending substantially<br>
longitudinally and transversely joining adjacent ones of the plurality of longerons. In<br>
such a possible construction, the first cross-sectional flexural rigidity can occur across the<br>
anchor brace of a proximal beam module; the second cross-sectional flexural rigidity can<br>
occur across the stabilizing web of the proximal beam module; the third cross-sectional<br>
flexural rigidity can occur on the anchor brace of the distal beam module and the fourth<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity can occur on the stabilizing web of the distal beam<br>
module.<br>
The flexural rigidity in the anchor braces can decrease by reducing the thickness<br>
of the anchor braces located at more distal locations toward the camera. Similarly, the<br>
thickness and density of the stabilizing web material can be reduced to decrease the<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity at more distal locations towards the camera. Another<br>
possibility, either alone or in combination with these two techniques, is to reduce the<br>
diameter or other cross-sectional detail of the longerons.<br>
In another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention, the<br>
longerons can extend substantially the entire length of the beam module. Alternatively,<br>
the longerons can be removably connected between adjacent beam modules. The<br>
longerons and the associated beam modules can even be removably connected by hand<br><br>
adjustable connectors to avoid the need for tools and to provide the ability to fine tune the<br>
parallel arrangement of the longerons along the length of the positioner.<br>
In another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention, each<br>
anchor brace region includes at least three anchor braces joined to provide a polygonal<br>
cross section to the respective anchor brace region. Another possible feature is that each<br>
stabilizing web region includes at least three panels of low density material joined to<br>
provide a polygonal cross section to the respective low density stabilizing web region.<br>
The polygonal cross section could be triangular.<br>
Another possibility is that each anchor brace and each stabilizing web is disposed<br>
away from the neutral longitudinal axis of the beam module.<br>
The anchor brace can be constructed in a variety of ways so long as it contributes<br>
to the cross-sectional flexural rigidity of the beam module at the given location and<br>
assists in maintaining the longerons in the spaced and parallel arrangements. One<br>
possible anchor brace construction can include specially shaped laminated wood webs<br>
extending between and connecting adjacent longerons. Similarly, the stabilizing webs<br>
can be provided by low density panels, made for example of expanded polypropylene<br>
(EPP), although other web materials capable of assisting in mamtaining longeron spacing<br>
and parallel alignment can be used. In some embodiments having features according to<br>
aspects of the invention, the stabilizing web of low density material is constructed as a<br>
plurality of panels, with each of the panels having a greater thickness and lower density<br>
than the adjacent anchor braces.<br>
The longerons can each be constructed as a pull-truded carbon fiber composite<br>
tube. Other constructions for arranging stiffening material such as carbon fiber in parallel<br><br>
axial streams or channels and displaced from the neutral axis are also possible according<br>
to aspects of the invention.<br>
Other embodiments having one or more features according to aspects of the<br>
invention can include a camera mount in the form of a front end module for moveably<br>
mounting the camera to the distal beam module. The front end module can include a<br>
pan/tilt assembly and a pan/tilt support assembly. The pan/tilt support assembly can<br>
connect to the distal beam module and supports the pan/tilt assembly. The pan/tilt<br>
assembly supports the camera and permits the optical-axis of the camera to pan and tilt<br>
relative to the longitudinal axis of the distal beam module.<br>
In one preferred arrangement, the pan/tilt support assembly includes a pan drive<br>
platform connected to and extending substantially longitudinally from a distal-most end<br>
of a beam module to a pan bearing head. The pan/tilt assembly can then rotatably depend<br>
from the pan bearing head, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the positioner. One or<br>
more support legs can also be provided to connect to and extend from the beam module<br>
and connect to the pan drive platform substantially adjacent to the pan bearing head.<br>
In the case of a triangular beam module, the pan/tilt support assembly can<br>
transition from a three-point junction with the beam module to a unified junction with the<br>
pan bearing head. The pan bearing head can optionally and preferably include support<br>
flanges for connecting the pan bearing head to the pan drive platform. Another variation<br>
in the embodiment can provide lateral support struts depending from and extending along<br>
the length direction of the pan drive platform. Such a pan/tilt support assembly could<br>
include angle brackets and anchor plates for connecting the pan drive platform and the<br>
support legs to respective longerons of the beam module. Lateral stiffeners in the form of<br><br>
cross bars or wires can also be extended between two or more of the pan drive platform<br>
and the support legs.<br>
An embodiment having one or more features according to aspects of lie invention<br>
could include a pan drive assembly including a pan drive motor mounted on the pan drive<br>
platform, a pan drive sprocket rotated by the pan drive motor, a pan drive chain driven by<br>
the pan drive sprocket, a pan axle gear disk driven by the pan drive chain, a pan axle<br>
rotatably mounted on the pan bearing head and rotated by the pan axle gear disc; and a<br>
pan-tilt hanger plate attached to the pan axle for mounting the pan/tilt assembly.<br>
Additionally, a pan drive mounting and tensioning plate, moveably mounted on the pan<br>
drive platform to adjust the tension in the pan drive chain, could be provided.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include a pan/tilt assembly having a pan carriage rotatably attached to the pan bearing<br>
head; a tilt carriage supported by the pan carriage; and a tilt drive assembly including a<br>
tilt drive motor on the tilt carriage; a tilt drive sprocket; a tilt drive chain and a tilt drive<br>
gear disc, all interconnected to rotate the tilt carriage and the motor assembly therewith.<br>
The embodiment could also have a tilt drive motor mounting plate for supporting the tilt<br>
drive motor and tilt drive sprocket, with the tilt drive motor mounting plate being<br>
adjustably connected to the tilt carriage for adjusting the tension of the tilt drive chain.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include a pan carriage shaped as a channel with a base and two transversely extending<br>
flanges. The base can be connected to the pan bearing head and the tilt carriage can be<br>
rotatably mounted between the two flanges. The tilt can also be shaped as a channel with<br>
a base and two transversely extending flanges, with the camera being mounted to the base<br><br>
and the two flanges being rotatably mounted to the flanges of the pan carriage. The<br>
carriages can be constructed of laminated wood with the tilt carriage optionally being<br>
thinner than the pan carriage.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include a user interface that provides a handle module. The handle module can include a<br>
handle shaft extending proximally from the beam module and a handle grip moveably<br>
mounted in the handle shaft. The handle grip can be slidingly or rotatably mounted on.<br>
the handle shaft, or both. The handle module could further include a grip ring mounted<br>
adjacent a proximal terminus of the handle shaft for rotating the positioner.<br>
The handle module could also include a manual control for at least one of camera<br>
tilt and camera pan enclosed within a control cage at its proximal end. The control cage<br>
can provide a hollow interior, with the camera control being placed in the hollow interior<br>
of the control cage but accessible by the operator's hand while interfacing with the<br>
positioner. This camera control could be a joystick. The control cage can be defined by<br>
peripherally spaced ribs operatively connected to the handle shaft, with the ribs providing<br>
gaps between them and an open proximal end.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include a beam module providing at least one base plate at the proximal end of its anchor<br>
brace region and a handle terminus plate more distally within the anchor brace region.<br>
The handle can be secured by the base plate and the handle terminus plate. The beam<br>
module could include a base plate assembly, with the base plate assembly including a<br>
proximal plate and a distal base plate compressing a foam pad to fix the base plates<br>
against translation along the handle shaft through friction fit with the foam pad. In<br><br>
another arrangement having features according to aspects of the invention, one of the<br>
proximal base plate and the distal base plate is larger than the other, the larger one<br>
providing mass reducing holes that also provide additional operator interface surfaces.<br>
A handle module could further include a second manual camera control for<br>
controlling one of pan and tilt, and an adjustable camera control mount connected to the<br>
base plate assembly, with the second manual camera control being mounted to the camera<br>
control mount and positionally adjustable relative to the handle shaft.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include hand adjustable connectors between the various adjustable and disassemble-able<br>
components of the positioner to permit field adjustments and assembly and disassembly<br>
without tools. Most, if not all, of the hand adjustable fasteners could be nylon to reduce<br>
the mass of the positioner. Nylon fasteners can also provide "weak points" that can break<br>
away under impact with foreign objects before more expensive components are damaged<br>
by the collision.<br>
Another embodiment having features according to aspects of the invention can<br>
include various auxiliary systems, such as a VCR, an operator mounted monitor,<br>
preferably in the form of goggles, a camera motion control unit and a camera control unit<br>
as well as a battery pack, all arranged to be stored and mounted on the user through a<br>
support garment, such as a vest. The various units can be connected to each other and to<br>
the camera, controls and drives on the positioner through various cabling.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS AND PREFERENCES<br>
The subject matter according to aspects of the invention is directed to camera<br>
supports. Camera supports according to aspects of the invention can be held,<br>
maneuvered and controlled by a single operator. Such camera supports can be hand-held,<br>
or can be partially supported by the operator's body while being hand-held. The camera<br>
supports in various configurations, disclosed herein as examples, can provide remote<br>
placement of the camera from the operator at substantial distances, perrrdtting optical axis<br>
placement and pointing from significant heights and wide lateral positions.<br>
Additionally, the remote positioning provided by the camera supports provides a<br>
large range of motion, unhindered by equipment, such as a tripod or dolly that can be<br>
either stationary or limited in their mobility. Instead, camera supports according to<br>
principles of the invention enjoy the same degree of mobility and maneuverability as the<br>
operator who supports and controls them. Superimposing, within the camera support<br>
structure itself, motion control of the camera, such as pan and tilt, on the range and<br>
degree of motion provided by the camera support can provide an expanded degree of<br>
camera placements and field of view, with resulting enhanced image dynamics.<br>
Prior to describing embodiments having features according to aspects of the<br>
invention, some notes on the language used are in order. Throughout this specification,<br>
reference is made to embodiments and various structure and operations as "exemplary,"<br>
which is intended to simply characterize the subject matter as an example or as<br>
illustrative, but not necessarily the best of its kind. The following disclosure with<br>
reference to the figures of drawing is intended solely for illustrative purposes and not as<br>
limiting the scope of the subject matter of the invention to the disclosed examples.<br><br>
Referring generally to the figures of drawing and in particular to FIG. 1, an<br>
exemplary embodiment of portions of a remote camera positioning and control system<br>
having features according to aspects of the invention is shown. In general, the system 10<br>
includes a positioner 12 having a handle module 14, a beam module 16, and a front end<br>
module 18, for supporting a remotely placed camera. Auxiliary systems can also be<br>
provided and worn by the operator, using, for example, a vest 20. Auxiliary sub-systems<br>
22 can be interconnected to each other and to associated components on the positioner<br>
using cabling 24. Further details of system parts are discussed more fully below.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the exemplary camera positioning and control system 10<br>
includes generally a series of interconnected sections or modules 14,16,18 that together<br>
form a boom 12 for suspending a camera lens and detector 26 at the remote distal end for<br>
positioning and control by the handle module 14 at a proximal end. Between the camera<br>
26 and the handle module 14, the boom 12 is constructed of one or more beam modules<br>
16 which can include a proximal beam module 28 and a distal beam module 30.<br>
Although two beam modules 16 are illustrated, one beam module can be utilized or three<br>
or more beam modules can be utilized depending on the desired length for the boom 12.<br>
For purposes of this specification, the beam module adjacent the handle module 14 is<br>
identified as the proximal beam module 28 while the beam module adjacent to the front<br>
end assembly 18 supporting the camera 26 is referred to as the distal beam module 30.<br>
The beam module refers to the collective beam structure between the handle<br>
module 14 and the front-end module 18, and can be embodied as a single, unified beam<br>
structure or can be provided in multiple beams that are either permanently or removably<br>
connected to each other and to the other boom sections for use. The illustrated example<br><br>
shows two beam modules—an exemplary proximal beam module 28 and an exemplary<br>
distal beam module 30—proximal and distal referring to their relative position along the<br>
length of the positioner 12 from the proximal operator end of the system 10 to the distal<br>
camera end of the system 10. Additional beam modules can be added or a single beam<br>
module can be employed, but for ease of illustration and discussion, a two beam module<br>
example will be used.<br>
Suspended from the remote end of the distal beam module 30 is the front end<br>
assembly 18, which can be made up of a pan/tilt support 32 from which is suspended a<br>
pan/tilt assembly 34 to which the camera 26 is mounted.<br>
The remote camera positioning and control system is supported by various<br>
auxiliary systems 22 that can be mounted to the operator using a support garment such as<br>
the vest 20. The auxiliary systems 22 preferably include a battery pack 36, a VCR 38 or<br>
other video signal recording system, a motion control system 40 and a camera control<br>
unit 42. Monitoring of the video signals taken by the camera can be provided by a<br>
monitor on the vest 20. Preferably, the monitor is provided on goggles 44 that are worn<br>
by the operator so that the video image is constantly in the operator's field of view. The<br>
cabling 24 for connecting the various auxiliary systems can be linked to the various<br>
components of the boom 12 through one or more umbilical cords which are discussed<br>
more fully below. Thus, the illustrated embodiment having features according to aspects<br>
of the invention provides a completely self-contained, operator supported system for<br>
remotely positioning and controlling a camera out of the operator's reach. The boom 12<br>
is designed to be sufficiently light weight to be held and maneuvered by the operator<br>
without ground support or other assistance while providing sufficient flexural rigidity<br><br>
against deflections induced by motion of the boom 12 and external forces such as wind<br>
and light structural impact<br>
Other features of the embodiment according to aspects of the invention include<br>
construction of the handle module 14. Preferably, the handle module 14 is equipped with<br>
a handle shaft 46 onto which a handle grip 48 is slidably and rotatably mounted. At the<br>
proximal end of the shaft handle, a proximal or rear handle assembly 50 is provided that<br>
includes at its proximal end a handle ring 52. The handle ring 52 provides an opening<br>
into a control cage 54 formed by a series of ribs 56 that surround a camera control, such<br>
as a joy stick unit 58. The handle ring 52 enables the operator to freely rotate the boom<br>
12 with associated rotation of the camera 26. For this purpose, the handle grip 48 is<br>
preferably rotatably mounted on the handle shaft 46 so that the grip 48 can be held<br>
stationary in one hand and the handle shaft 46 and the associated, connected boom 12 can<br>
rotate relative to the stationary grip 48. Likewise, if the grip 48 is preferably mounted to<br>
also slide, the handle ring 52 can be used to translate the boom 12 axially relative to the<br>
stationary grip 48, thus providing axial translation of the camera 26.<br>
The camera control, such as the joystick 58, can be configured to control pan and<br>
tilt of the camera 26. By superimposing the boom motions of rotation and axial<br>
translation on the pan and tilt motion of the camera 26, complex camera motions and<br>
resulting image dynamics can be achieved. The variations in camera positioning and<br>
motion achieved by these boom positioning and pan/tilt controls is further expanded by<br>
the ability to rotate the boom 12 relative to the handle grip 48 in a full 360° range of<br>
motion as well as transverse, vertical and angular translation of the boom 12 through the<br>
operator's arm and body movements as well as walking, or even running.<br><br>
The essentially acrobatic maneuverability of tbe boom 12 and the associated<br>
camera movement and image dynamics can be achieved while minimizing camera image<br>
instability by providing a beam structure mat is light weight yet provides relatively great<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity. Each beam module 16 is equipped with areas of<br>
concentrated stiffness spaced away from the neutral axis of the beam module's cross-<br>
section. Preferably, these lines of concentrated stiffness are provided by longerons 60<br>
that extend the length of the beam module 16. In the illustrated embodiment, a triangular<br>
cross-section is provided with a longeron 60 extending axially at each of the three comers<br>
of the triangular cross-section. Other cross-sectional geometries are possible including<br>
square and other polygonal shapes with longerons or other concentrated stiffening<br>
structure arranged along the corners of the polygonal shape.<br>
In each beam section, the longerons 60 are preferably reinforced in a proximal<br>
region by anchor braces 62 that are constructed to increase the cross-sectional flexural<br>
rigidity of the beam 16. Each beam module 16 is also preferably constructed to provide a<br>
region of stabilizing webs 64 that, while providing less cross-sectional flexural rigidity,<br>
serve to maintain the spacing and parallel alignment of the longerons 60.<br>
The beam modules 16 are preferably constructed to provide a first relatively high<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity at the proximal end of the proximal beam module 28 and<br>
decrease the cross-sectional flexural rigidity distally towards the camera 34. Along the<br>
length of the beam modules 16, the cross-sectional flexural rigidity can begin relatively<br>
high, for example, in the region of the anchor braces 62 of the proximal beam module 28<br>
and then decrease to a second relatively lower cross-sectional flexural rigidity in the<br>
region of the stabilizing webs 64 of the proximal beam module 28. According to an<br><br>
aspect of the invention, the cross-sectional flexural rigidity can then increase in the region<br>
of the anchor braces 62 region of the distal beam module 30 and again decrease to a<br>
fourth relatively lower cross-sectional flexural rigidity in the region of the stabilizing<br>
webs 64 region of the distal beam module 30. While the illustrated embodiment is<br>
constructed to provide discrete anchor brace regions and stabilizing web regions, the<br>
beam modules can be provided with a continuous beam construction that transitions in<br>
cross-sectional flexural rigidity through variations in the cross-sectional design of the<br>
anchor braces, for example, by decreasing the thickness of the brace material, the<br>
material selected and the degree of reinforcement of the brace material, such as through<br>
decreasing degrees of reinforcing lamination of a substrate for the anchor brace materials.<br>
The stabilizing web regions of successive beam modules may also be of successively<br>
thinner or lower density material in order to achieve lengthwise variation of flexural<br>
rigidity and mass per unit length of the assembled positioner.<br>
The front end assembly 18 is preferably constructed to provide the pan/tilt<br>
assembly support 32 formed to transition from the relatively strong and stiff comer points<br>
of the beam design in the case of the illustrated embodiment These points of strength<br>
and stiffness are the three longeron regions of the triangular cross-section. The pan/tilt<br>
support assembly 32 transitions from the three points of the triangular beam cross-section<br>
to a bearing head 66 from which the pan/tilt assembly 34 and camera mount 26 can be<br>
suspended. Preferably, the camera 26 is positioned on the pan/tilt assembly 34 so as to be<br>
positioned on the neutral axis of the boom 12 through as great a range of motion as<br>
possible. Further details of the construction of the various modules and sections of the<br>
boom design and the associated auxiliary system are discussed in turn below.<br><br>
Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B collectively, FIG. 2A shows the proximal beam<br>
module 28 assembled with a portion of the handle shaft 46 anchored to it FIG. 2B<br>
provides an exploded view of portions of the proximal beam module 28. Because of its<br>
junction with a handle module, the proximal beam module 28 provides a base plate<br>
assembly 68 to be described in a later portion of this specification.<br>
Each longeron 60 is located along an apex of the triangular cross-section. Each<br>
longeron 60 extends the length of the beam module 28. Each longeron 60 is preferably<br>
constructed as a "pull-traded" carbon fiber composite tube having an outer diameter of<br>
approximately 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch, and a thick wall relative to the outer diameter, hi the<br>
anchor brace region, the three longerons 60 are joined laterally by anchor braces 62. The<br>
anchor braces 62 can be constructed in a number of different manners provided they<br>
provide sufficient flexural rigidity for the beam 28. In the illustrated embodiment, the<br>
anchor braces 62 are constructed with 3-ply wood substrate 70 with primary grain<br>
extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the beam module 28. Each anchor brace 62<br>
is partially cut away to form a series of connected x-forms having curved edges. The x-<br>
forms are laminated in the center sections on both the exterior and interior faces with<br>
very thin, for example, 0.007-inch, pre-cured carbon fiber composite sheets 72 arranged<br>
with the major fiber axis transverse to the beam module length, using epoxy for bonding<br>
to the wood substrate 70. The anchor braces 62 are bonded in the regions adjoining the<br>
longerons 60 on the exterior face with a conformal applied layer of plain weave carbon<br>
fiber cloth and epoxy composite 74. The primary fiber axes of the conformally applied<br>
cloth are biased 45° relative to the longitudinal axis of the beam section 28 for maximum<br>
sheer strength and stability across the bond. Between the center regions of the forward or<br><br>
distal x-form is a handle tube terminal plate 76 preferably made of plywood with a 3/32-<br>
inch thick 5-ply wood gusset 78 ground to a frusto-conical support profile with an outer<br>
diameter approximately 1/2-inch greater than the outer diameter of the handle tube 34.<br>
The handle terrninal plate 76 is bonded to the anchor braces 62 using hardwood cove<br>
dollhouse molding 80 and epoxy. The triangular cross-section of the beam 28 is<br>
circumferentially bound with carbon fiber tow 82 and epoxy at the location of the handle<br>
terminal plate 76. In the stabilizing web region of the beam module 28, which typically<br>
extends three to four times longer than the length of the anchor brace region, the<br>
longerons 60 are joined using webs 64 of a low-density material such as expanded<br>
polypropylene (EPP) having a greater thickness and lower density than the anchor braces<br>
62.<br>
The EPP panels 64 of the illustrated embodiment are provided with a beveled<br>
edge to join in a triangular configuration and are slotted with channels 84 to receive the<br>
tubular longerons 60. The EPP panels 64 can be connected using epoxy. The stabilizing<br>
web region is preferably constructed to provide uniformity along its lengdi.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the cross section of the stabilizing web region of the beam<br>
module 28 includes the pull-truded, composite, thick wall, tubular longerons 60 and EPP<br>
plate stabilizing webs 64, with a hollow center section 86 through which a system wire<br>
harness (not shown) is preferably routed as described in further detail later in this<br>
specification.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 4A and 4B, the proximal beam module and distal beam<br>
module are preferably removably connected by junction of each of the three respective<br>
longerons. The longerons of the various beam modules can be removably inter-<br><br>
connected using any of a number of end rod connectors. According to one embodiment<br>
having features according to aspects of the invention, the longerons 60 can be connected<br>
using a clevis 88 and eye 70 arrangement For example, each longeron of the proximal<br>
beam module can receive, within its hollow tube end, a knurled shaft end (not shown) of<br>
an end connector insert 92, bonded in place by epoxy (not shown), and have a Kevlar<br>
thread lashing 94 about the exterior of the longeron end, preferably about the mid-length<br>
region of the bonded portion of the end connector 92. The end connector 92 can be<br>
equipped with an adjustable tumbuckle 96 having a series of adjusting nuts 98 for<br>
varying the length of the tumbuckle 96 and the associated end connector. The end<br>
connector 92 of the proximal beam module longeron can be formed as a flexible clevis 88<br>
having a pin 100 between the flanges 102 of the clevis 88 mat extends from one flange<br>
and removably fits into a recess 104 in the second flange. The longeron of the distal<br>
beam module can be similarly equipped with an end connector having an adjustable<br>
tumbuckle 98.<br>
The end connector for the distal beam module longeron can be provided with a<br>
mating eye connector 90 for receiving and pivotally engaging the pin 100 of the flexible<br>
clevis 88. As shown in FIG. 4B, once the pin 100 of the clevis 88 is mated with the eye<br>
connector 90, the connection can be secured by a sliding collar 106 to retain the flexible<br>
flanges 102 of the clevis 8 8 in a closed position. Because the stability of the beam<br>
module is most dependent upon maintaining the longerons 60 in a substantially parallel<br>
arrangement, the lengths of the longerons 60 can be adjusted across a continuous range<br>
by the tumbuckles 96 to "fine tune" the relative lengths of the longerons 60 and the<br>
parallel arrangement resulting therefrom. Although a clevis-eye arrangement of<br><br>
connection has been disclosed, other rod end connectors are possible. It is also possible<br>
that the longerons can be continuous across the entire beam length. However, having<br>
separable beam modules enables selectivity in the length of the boom as well as the<br>
ability to break the boom down for storage, transport and repair. In this regard, it is<br>
preferred that the connectors are hand adjustable to minimize the needs for tools,<br>
particularly in the field where adjustments and repairs may be necessary during use of the<br>
camera positioning system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, an embodiment of a front end assembly for a camera<br>
positioning system having features according to aspects of the invention is shown. It is<br>
preferred that the front end assembly 18 include a pan/tilt support 32 that transitions from<br>
connection to the plurality of longerons 60 provided by the beam module 16 to a unified<br>
connection adjacent to the pan/tilt assembly 34. Additionally, it is preferred that the<br>
pan/tilt support 32 is arranged to present the pan/tilt assembly 34 and the camera mounted<br>
thereon (not shown, see FIG. 1.) substantially along the neutral axis of the beam 16<br>
throughout as much range of motion of the camera as possible. To this end, the<br>
illustrated embodiment of a pan/tilt support 32 for the front end assembly 18 includes a<br>
tripod-like arrangement including a pan drive platform 108 and two pan/tilt support legs<br>
110. The pan/tilt support legs 110 extend from an interface with two respective<br>
longerons 60 and join the pan drive support 108 adjacent the pan/tilt bearing head 66.<br>
The pan/tilt support legs 110 are preferably constructed of 1/8-inch low-density 3-ply<br>
wood core with the primary wood grain direction being substantially parallel to the<br>
length. Each leg 110 can be tapered and provided with a series of mass reducing<br>
cutaways. Each pan/tilt support leg 110 is preferably reinforced with fiberglass epoxy<br><br>
laminated skin using 1/2-ounce per square yard satin weave cloth on a 45° bias and low<br>
viscosity "Z-Poxy" laminating resin,.available from Pacer Technologies. Other<br>
laminating materials may be used in the skins to increase strength and stiffness. The legs<br>
110 and their arrangement in the pan/tilt support 32 provide relatively strong and stiff<br>
support relative to weight, yet provide flexibility to absorb energy through out of plane<br>
bending and torsion before incurring significant damage.<br>
The pan drive 108 platform is preferably arranged to extend from the -remaining<br>
longeron 60 of the distal beam module to a junction with the pan/tilt support legs 110 and<br>
the bearing head 66. The pan drive platform 108 provides a substantially planar surface<br>
to which can be mounted various components of the pan drive, as will be discussed more<br>
fully below. The pan drive platform 108 is preferably constructed of a low-density 3-<br>
plywood core and reinforced by lateral support struts 112. The lateral support struts 112<br>
are preferably parallel to the planes of the sides of the triangular distal beam module 16,<br>
each being substantially 60° out of plane with the pan drive platform 108. The lateral<br>
struts 112 in the platform 108 can be approximately 1/8-inch in thickness, which provides<br>
good stability and avoids the undesirable flexibility associated with thinner plates.<br>
Reinforcing lamination may also be utilized.<br>
In order to position the pan/tilt assembly 34 and the camera mounted thereon in<br>
the area of the neutral axis while providing for rotation, pan and tilt movement, it is<br>
desirable for the pan/tilt assembly 34 to depend from the support 32. Accordingly, the<br>
pan/tilt support 34 of the illustrated embodiment preferably includes the pan bearing head<br>
66 which joins the pan drive platform 108 and support legs 110 and provides an axis of<br>
rotation oriented substantially vertically in the arrangement of the boom illustrated in<br><br>
FIG. 5. The pan bearing head 66 preferably is constructed with a wood core composite<br>
shell with mounting flanges 114 to join with the support legs 110 and pan drive platform<br>
108. The pan bearing head 66 is provided with an axial opening preferably of 3/4-inch<br>
diameter for press fit engagement of a 3/4 outer diameter bearing. Vertical grain balsa<br>
core, with 3/32 5-ply top and bottom wood face sheets that are epoxy bonded to the balsa<br>
core, is preferred. The resulting structure is shaped and machined, then conformally<br>
laminated with 1.4-ounce per square yard plain weave carbon fiber cloth and "Z-Poxy"<br>
laminating resin. The resulting structure provides a mass of approximately 10 grams yet<br>
bears essentially all the support forces of the pan/tilt assembly and remains substantially<br>
rigid. It provides a pivotal structure to transmit loads from the pan/tilt assembly 34 to the<br>
pan drive platform 108 and the pan/tilt support legs 110.<br>
The pan bearing head support flanges 114 can be formed as a single unit with the<br>
pan bearing head 66 or can be separately fabricated and connected to the pan bearing<br>
head 66. The pan bearing head support flanges 114 are preferably constructed from 3/32-<br>
inch 5-ply wood partially laminated with an overlapping 1.4 ounce per square yard<br>
carbon fiber composite conformal lamination from the bearing head end and with "Z-<br>
Poxy" laminating resin. The pan bearing head support flanges 114 can also be provided<br>
with mass reducing circular cutaways. The pan drive for rotating the pan/tilt assembly 34<br>
relative to the pan bearing head 66 is mounted to and supported by the pan/tilt support<br>
assembly 32 and in particular on the pan drive platform 108. The pan drive includes a<br>
pan drive motor assembly 116. Preferably, the pan drive motor assembly 116 includes a<br>
Faulhaber/MicroMo 1524 brush commutation coreless motor with a 152-to-l gear box<br>
and an IE-512 quad encoder. Alternative motor assemblies can be utilized but high<br><br>
encoder count per output shaft revolution, high degree of programmability, compact size<br>
and low mass are preferred specifications resulting in smooth motion control for panning<br>
the pan/tilt assembly without sacrificing positioner maneuverability.<br>
Ihe motor assembly 116 can be positioned on the platform 108 to provide its<br>
drive shaft substantially vertically. A pan drive sprocket 118 can be provided for transfer<br>
of the drive motor motion to the pan/tilt assembly through a pan drive chain 120 and pan<br>
drive gear disk 122.<br>
The pan drive sprocket 118 is preferably a Delran molded 6-spoke gear having a<br>
1/4-inch inner-diameter, 32 teeth and a 1.24-inch pitch diameter. The pan drive chain<br>
120 is preferably a "Serve-O-L Link" chain C1227 made of Dupont Delran 500 acetyl<br>
resin. The chain 120 preferably has an approximately 1/8-inch pitch and can be<br>
approximately 92 links long for the illustrated embodiment Alternative chain designs<br>
are possible, but important characteristics that have been identified include a low mass of<br>
plastic to avoid contributing to the inertia of the camera pointing motion and relatively<br>
weakly attached snap-together chain links that can serve as an over-torque protection for<br>
the relatively expensive drive assembly. Snapped together fastening of the links allows<br>
for damage-free disconnect in the event of external object strike, for example.<br>
The pan axle gear disk 122 can be constructed in a number of ways but preferably<br>
is provided with a plastic gear ring on a central wood disk. The pan axle gear disk 122<br>
preferably has a 32 teeth Delran gear ring surrounding a 1/8-inch thick 3-ply low-density<br>
ply wood core disk that friction fits onto the pan axle tube. Other polymers or composite<br>
molded, cast or cut or otherwise manufactured parts may also be utilized. The wood disk<br>
arrangement serves as a fail-safe clutch in case of drive over-torque conditions due to<br><br>
foreign object strikes, for example. The low mass of the plastic and wood gear disk 122<br>
does not contribute significantly to the inertia of the pan/tilt motion and the plywood<br>
plate core can be laser cut or otherwise fabricated to very good tolerance and<br>
repeatability. The pan drive assembly preferably also includes a mounting and tensioning<br>
plate (not shown) along the top of the pan drive platform 108. The plate can be<br>
constructed as a composite with a plywood core and carbon fibers/fiberglass/epoxy skins.<br>
In one embodiment, a 1/32-inch thick 3-ply wood core is utilized with carbon fiber cloth<br>
of 1.4 ounce per square yard plain weave on a 45° bias, with a second skin of<br>
unidirectional, 3.5 ounce per square yard carbon fiber that is 0.006-inches thick and<br>
arranged with the fiber grains parallel to the major grain axis of the ply wood core. A<br>
third skin of the fiberglass cloth utilizing 1/2 ounce per square yard satin weave on a 45°<br>
bias can also be utilized. The matrix material can be a "Z-Poxy" laminating resin.<br>
The pan drive mounting and tensioning plate can be adjustably mounted to the<br>
pan drive platform 108 utilizing a screw and thumb nut assembly 124 to slide the pan<br>
motor 116 relative to the pan axis for tensioning of the pan drive chain 120. Nylon<br>
screws are preferred for their low mass and hand adjustability.<br>
At the proximal end of each of the pan drive platform 108 and the two support<br>
legs 110, an angle bracket 126 can be provided as one possibility for joining the pan/tilt<br>
support 32 to the distal beam module 16. Each angle bracket 126 can have a generally<br>
trapezoidal shape with angled side flanges for mounting to the support legs 110 and pan<br>
drive platform 108 using, for example, nylon bolts and nuts. Additionally, using<br>
preferably nylon bolts and wing nuts 128, a series of flat anchor plates can extend from<br>
the angle brackets 126 and provide an additional aperture for mounting onto the ends of<br><br>
the longerons 60. Each of the longerons 60 can provide, for the purposes of fastening, a<br>
threaded end that can be capped by any of a number of fasteners, including, for example,<br>
tumbuckles with jam nuts 130. The support legs 110 can be further braced laterally by a<br>
stiffening structure, such as a lateral stiffener 132, which is preferably constructed of 3-<br>
ply wood, although various thicknesses of plates and materials can be used as well. The<br>
triangular arrangement of the illustrated pan/tilt support assembly 32 can be further<br>
stiffened at its junction with the distal beam module 16 by thin carbon fiber wire 134<br>
secured to the angle brackets 126 by thin gusset plates in each corner having a hole to<br>
match the bolt hole footprint of the angled brackets 126 and the titanium mounting plates.<br>
The carbon fiber wires 134 are preferably 0.035-inch diameter carbon fiber epoxy pull-<br>
traded wire bonded to 1/32-inch thick 3-ply wood corner gussets using 1/2 ounce per<br>
square foot satin weave fiberglass cloth on a 45° bias and gap-filling, cyano-acrylate<br>
adhesive. Alternatively, various diameter rods, various thickness plates and various<br>
cross-sections of bulk low-density stiffening materials, such as balsa wood, may be<br>
employed. This stiffening arrangement helps maintain dimensional stability of the beam<br>
cross-section, thereby reducing unwanted deflection of the camera.<br>
Referring again to the pan bearing head 66, an axial assembly 136 can be<br>
provided for permitting relative rotation of the pan/tilt assembly 34. Details of preferred<br>
components of the axle assembly 136 are discussed more fully below.<br>
The pan/tilt assembly 34 is preferably secured to the axle assembly 136 of the pan<br>
bearing head 66 by a series of finger releasable nylon screws and nuts 138. The pan/tilt<br>
assembly 34 generally provides a channel-shaped pan carriage 140 which supports the<br>
entire pan/tilt assembly 34 and rotates relative to the pan/tilt support assembly 32.<br><br>
Nested pivotally within the pan carriage 140 is a tilt or camera carriage 142 which can<br>
rotate in the tilt plane relative to the pan carriage 140 under the actuation of a tilt motor<br>
drive assembly.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an exploded view of an embodiment of a pan/tilt assembly 34<br>
having features according to aspects of the invention is shown. The pan/tilt assembly 34<br>
preferably depends from the pan bearing head 66 so that the combined center of mass of<br>
all portions of the system distal to the distal end of the distal beam module is positioned<br>
on the neutral axis of the beam throughout as much of its range of motion as possible.<br>
The pan/tilt assembly 34 can mount to a pan/tilt hanger plate 146 mounted on a pan axle<br>
tube 136 of the pan bearing head 60. The pan/tilt hanger plate 146 is preferably arranged<br>
as an x-form with four mounting wings, each having at least one fastener hole. The<br>
hanger plate 146 can be constructed with a 1/32-inch thick 3-ply wood core with 3-ply<br>
carbon fiber-fiberglass-epoxy composite laminations on each face.<br>
The first ply is a plain weave lightweight carbon fiber cloth on an angled bias<br>
with respect to the primary wood grain direction of the plywood core. The second ply is<br>
unidirectional carbon fiber tow oriented in parallel to the primary wood grain direction.<br>
The third ply is preferably a satin weave fiberglass cloth of very lightweight on a bias<br>
with respect to the primary wood grain direction of the core. The skin lamination stack<br>
sequence is the same on both sides of the hanger plate 146. The matrix material can be<br>
E-Z-Lam low viscosity laminating resin available, for example, through Aerospace<br>
Composite Products of San Leandro, California, U.S.A. The carbon fiber cloth of the<br>
first ply can be 1.4 ounce per square yard plain weave on a 45° bias. The second layer<br>
can utilize carbon fiber unidirectional cloth of 3.5 ounce per square yards and 0.006-<br><br>
inches thickness aligned parallel to the major grain axis of the plywood core. The<br>
fiberglass cloth can be 1/2 ounce per square yard satin weave on a 45° bias. Different<br>
weights of plain weave carbon fiber and fiberglass will give varying degrees of strength,<br>
stiffness and mass of the finished structure. Kevlar may also be added for increased<br>
toughness but is more difficult to cut.<br>
The pan axle tube 136 is preferably constructed as a Thin wall fiberglass epoxy<br>
composite having a 1/2-inch outer diameter with a series of selectable placement holes<br>
for a spring clip (not shown) that allows adjustment of the spacing of the hanger plate 146<br>
relative to the pan bearing head 66 parallel to the pan axis. The axle 136 can be mounted<br>
to the pan bearing head 66 using pan axle bearings (not shown).<br>
The pan carriage 140, as noted above, is preferably arranged as a channel form<br>
having a base 150 with two transverse flanges 152. The pan carriage 140 can mount to<br>
the pan/tilt hanger plate 146 preferably by a series of finger releasable nylon screws and<br>
thumb nuts (not shown). The base 150 of the pan carriage 140 has slotted holes for<br>
lateral positional adjustment of the pan/tilt assembly 34 with respect to the central or<br>
neutral axis of the beam for purposes of dynamic balancing, for example, to place the<br>
center of mass of the pan/tilt assembly 34 substantially coincident with the pan axis, thus<br>
substantially minimizing unwanted dynamic reaction forces from being applied to the<br>
pan/tilt support 32 and therefore to the beam structure of the positioner system as a result<br>
of pan motion. The pan carriage core is preferably constructed of a low-density 3-ply<br>
wood base 150 and standard density 3-ply wood flanges 152 mounted at right angles to<br>
the base 150, using epoxy bonded hard wood cover doll-housing molding, ground smooth<br>
to interfaces of the base 150 and flanges 152. The major grain axis of the base 150 and<br><br>
flanges 152 are preferably aligned in the hoop direction of the channel form. The radii of<br>
the inner and outer surface of the core channel form thickness are such that the thickness<br>
of the core is greater at comers than the thickness of the base 150 or flange plates 152.<br>
The plywood base 150 is preferably 1/8-inch thick along the base and 1/16-inch thick on<br>
the flanges 152. The greater thickness of the channel form at the corners increases<br>
bending strength and stiffness of the finished composite channel form structure and the<br>
use of plywood cores permits laser cutting and other computer numeric controlled<br>
manufacturing techniques to maintain tight tolerances and a high degree of repeatability.<br>
The pan carriage 140 can be provided with strengthening skin lamination similar to that<br>
described above with respect to the pan/tilt hanger plate 146.<br>
The pan carriage 140 can be equipped with hoop-shaped bumpers 150 to protect<br>
the pan/tilt assembly 34 and the nested camera from impact with exterior objects. The<br>
bumpers 156 can be made of titanium wire and are preferably heat shrink tubing covered<br>
at the ends which are mounted to the pan carriage 140 with plastic brackets 158. The<br>
brackets 15S are preferably mounted adjacent the base 150 of the pan carriage 140 so as<br>
to transmit impact forces to the roots of the flanges 152 and reduce the resulting bending<br>
moments and the possibility of damage to the flanges 152 themselves or other critical and<br>
difficult to manufacture components nested within the pan carriage 140.<br>
Depending from one flange 152 of the pan carriage 140 is an axle plate 160,<br>
having an axle tube 162 arranged normal to the plate 160 toward the interior of the pan<br>
carriage 140. This axle tube 162 has a support gusset ring on the opposite side of the<br>
plate from the axle tube. The axle plate 160 is mounted using hand adjustable fasteners<br>
that pass through slightly oversized holes in the plate, allowing for axial alignment of the<br><br>
axle plate and tube with the tilt bearing on the opposite flange of the pan carriage. The<br>
axle tube 162 passes through an oversized hole in the pan carriage flange 152 and<br>
supports the tilt drive gear disk 164, which is friction tit on the axle tube 162 after the<br>
axle tube 162 and plate 160 are attached to the pan carriage flange 152, as Well as one of<br>
two tilt bearings which is also applied to the axle tube 162 after the axle tube 162 and<br>
plate 160 are attached to the pan carriage flange 152. The axle tube 162 allows passage<br>
 of connectors and cabling for electrical components within the tilt assembly such as the<br>
camera detector and the tilt drive unit, as well as for lens articulation and lighting or<br>
microphone means, when used. On the opposite flange of the pan carriage 140 from the<br>
axle plate 160 is the other tilt bearing, press fit into a hole in that flange, which is also<br>
reinforced with a 3/32 inch thick 5-ply wood disk bonded to the flange.<br>
Continuing with the components between the two flanges 152 of the pan carriage<br>
140, the tilt bearing around the pan carriage-affixed axle tube and plate is press-fit into its<br>
own plate 166 which also has a bonded doubler ring composed of 3/32-inch thick 5 ply<br>
wood. This tilt bearing plate 166 is also attached to one flange of the tilt or camera<br>
carriage 142, using hand adjustable fasteners that pass through slightly oversized holes in<br>
the plate, allowing for adjustable axial alignment of the bearing plate with respect to the<br>
camera carriage 142. Specifically, the tilt bearing plate 166 is slidably adjustable in a<br>
direction parallel to the optical axis of the camera optics/detector assembly to allow the<br>
tilt axis to be made substantially coincident with the center of mass of the components<br>
that move with tilt motion, such as the camera optics and detector, the tilt drive 144, and<br>
lens articulation componentry and lighting fixtures when used. Also mounted to the other<br><br>
side of the same flange of the camera carriage is the tilt drive mounting plate 168, further<br>
described below.<br>
On the opposite flange of the camera carriage 142 from the tilt bearing plate and<br>
the tilt drive components is fastened an axle tube and plate 170, similar to that previously<br>
described with respect to the pan carriage 140. This axle tube 170 passes through the<br>
previously described bearing that is fixed in the pan carriage flange 152. This axle tube<br>
and plate assembly 170 also attaches to the camera carriage 142 by hand adjustable<br>
fasteners that pass through slightly oversized holes in the axle tube and plate 170,<br>
allowing for adjustable axial alignment of the bearing plate with respect to the camera<br>
carriage 142. The adjustably positionable nature of this attachment means serves in<br>
conjunction with the similar feature on the other bearing of the camera carriage 142 to<br>
allow for dynamic balancing of the tilt components about the tilt axis, helping to<br>
substantially rrdnimize unwanted dynamic reaction forces from being applied to more<br>
proximal structure of the positioner system as a result of tilt motion. Such dynamic<br>
balancing substantially minimizes pan/tilt motion-induced perturbation of the camera<br>
positioner structure, allowing less structure and therefore less mass within the positioner,<br>
a feature critical to the maneuverability and therefore also to the utility of the positioner.<br>
To contribute to the compact sizing of the pan-tilt assembly 34, the tilt drive<br>
assembly 144 is preferably mounted to the tilt carriage 142 and drives rotation of the tilt<br>
carriage 142 relative to the pan carriage 140 by a sprocket gear chain assembly 172 that<br>
revolves with the tilt carriage 142 itself. The camera/tilt carriage 142 is constructed as a<br>
channel form but includes an aperture for the lens of the camera (not shown). The<br>
camera/tilt carriage 142 is preferably formed with a wood core and lamination<br><br>
arrangement similar to that described above with respect to the pan carriage 140, but<br>
using a relatively thinner 1/16-inch thick 3-ply wood base and 1/32-inch thick 3-ply<br>
wood flanges.<br>
The tilt drive motor assembly 144 can utilize a DC Motor with an encoder and<br>
gear box. Preferably, a Faulhaber/MicroMo Model 1516A with a 152:1 gear ratio and an<br>
IE512 Encoder provides the drive power. Preferred performance characteristics are the<br>
same as those described above with respect to the pan drive motor assembly, although the<br>
torque requirement for motion about the tilt axis is typically less than that for pan since<br>
the tilt motion componentry is of physically smaller dimension andjs more compactly<br>
arranged about its axis of motion. The tilt drive motor assembly 144 is preferably<br>
secured to a mounting plate 168 that is, in turn, adjustably mounted on the interior of a<br>
flange of the tilt carriage 142. The tilt drive motor assembly mounting plate 168 can be<br>
formed by a 45mm thin plate with a drive shaft opening and an arcuate slot for a chain<br>
tensioning adjusting screw. End grain balsa core or carbon fiber composite with a<br>
fiberglass lamination layer can also be used for the tilt drive mounting plate 168. The<br>
adjusting screws are preferably hand adjustable and can be selected as nylon screws with<br>
thumb nuts. The output of the motor rotates a tilt drive sprocket which is constructed<br>
similarly to the pan drive sprocket discussed above (See FIG. 5) but having 24 teeth.<br>
Both sprockets can optionally be equipped with a hub collar and hub sleeve adjusted with<br>
two set screws (not shown). This interior arrangement for the sprocket can provide a slip<br>
clutch function as a protection against over-torque.<br>
The rotating sprocket is connected to the tilt drive gear disk by a tilt drive chain.<br>
The tilt drive chain can be similarly constructed as the drive chain utilized for the pan<br><br>
drive as discussed above in reference to FIG. 3. Similarly, the tilt drive gear disk can be<br>
constructed similar to the pan drive gear disk but having 24 teem. The interior wood disk<br>
can be press fit into the plastic gear teeth ring to provide another fail-safe clutch in case<br>
of drive over-torque conditions.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 7A and 7B, the proximal end of the handle module 14<br>
preferably includes a handle grip ring 52 that can be constructed as a circular ring<br>
suspended from the end of the handle tube 46. Alternative geometries for the ring are<br>
possible, but a circular arrangement is preferred for ease in handling by the operator in<br>
rotating the boom and holding the ring about its entire periphery without engaging a<br>
corner or other non-curved surface that may otherwise be experienced with a polygonal<br>
shape.<br>
The grip ring 52 is preferably suspended from the end of the handle tube 46<br>
through a series of ribs 56 that form a control cage 54 for surrounding and protecting a<br>
camera control unit such as the joystick unit 58. Any of a number of ribs can be<br>
provided, but as illustrated, four equally spaced ribs 56 can provide a protective cage for<br>
the joystick 58 while providing lateral openings for gripping of the ribs 56 as well as for<br>
alternative access to the joystick 58 in addition to the central opening in the ring 52 for<br>
accessing the joystick 58. The joystick 58 can be mounted inside a control enclosure<br>
housing 174 constructed of diagonally alternating biased sheer web made up of upper and<br>
lower rings of 1/4-inch nominal width 1/16-inch thick 3-ply wood and 4 quadrants<br>
between the cage ribs of 1/64-inch thickness 3-ply wood cut with alternating 45° grain<br>
lines. The quadrants can be laid up against the rings and abutted to the ribs, tacked into<br>
position with cyano-acrylate adhesive and anchored thoroughly with epoxy. The joystick<br><br>
control can include control electronics in a base housing (not shown) that is enclosed<br>
within the control support housing 174 and removably secured by a control mounting<br>
plate 176 that covers the rear opening of the control support housing 174. The control<br>
mounting plate 176 can provide four slots through which the cage ribs 56 extend in<br>
preferably friction fit relation.<br>
The juxtaposition of the joystick 58 relative to the handle ring 52 provides an<br>
ergonoroic relationship enabling the user to easily control boom movement both axially<br>
and rotationally while simultaneously manipulating the joystick 58 for control of camera<br>
motion or other camera controls. The joystick 58 can be configured electronically to<br>
control pan and tilt or alternatively to control other aspects of the camera such as iris and<br>
focus control. The joystick 58 can be equipped with a push button actuator 178 at its end<br>
for such functions as pause/record control of the video recorder discussed more fully<br>
below.<br>
Referring particularly to FIG. 7B, the handle tube 46 can be secured to the<br>
proximal handle assembly through a series of retaining rings, including a forward<br>
retaining ring 1 SO and a rear retaining ring 182. Each retaining ring 180,182 can have<br>
mass reducing cutaways that can also provide additional grip services for the operator.<br>
Each retaining ring 180,182 provides a central opening through which the handle 46<br>
passes to terminate adjacent the control enclosure housing 174. Each of the proximal<br>
handle assembly components are made of a single sheet of low-density 1/4-inch thick 5-<br>
ply wood with the exception of the end grip ring which is preferably made of two sheets<br>
of low-density 1/4-inch 5-ply wood resulting in an end ring thickness of preferably 1/2-<br>
inch.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a general schematic of the cabling arrangement and the inter-<br>
connection of various auxiliary systems for supporting the camera boom and its camera<br>
and controls is shown.<br>
The auxiliary support systems for the boom and camera include a video recording<br>
system such as a VCR 38 for receiving and storing video signal information from the<br>
camera 26 onto recordable media, such as tape, DVD or the like. The VCR 38 is<br>
preferably capable of recording the video signals in mini-DV format, such as the Sony<br>
GV-D900. Any number of other video recording systems are capable of use as long as<br>
they support the output format of the camera selected. The auxiliary systems can also<br>
include a motion control subsystem 40 for controlling the motor drive assemblies for pan<br>
and tilt. Preferably, the motion control system 40 includes a digital programmable motor<br>
controller such as the MicroMo-Faulhaber MCDC 2805 with a joystick interface circuit.<br>
This controller packaging can be housed with other control electronics for the joystick<br>
and can be enhanced with various customizable switches, indicator lamps and connectors<br>
to further integrate the auxiliary systems. The auxiliary systems also preferably include a<br>
camera control unit 42 such as the Toshiba IK-TU 40A CCU, which provides front panel<br>
controls and detector connectors, rear panel connectors and can provide broadcast quality<br>
control of camera image signals and engineering parameters.<br>
Monitoring of the camera images is preferably provided by a monitor mounted to<br>
the operator to maintain the self-contained nature of the camera positioning and control<br>
system. While smaller monitors can be equipped on the operator's body, monitor goggles<br>
44 such as the Sony PLM-A35 are preferred in that they provide the camera imaging<br>
directly in the operator's field of view at all times. While some of the components such<br><br>
as the goggles 44 and the VCR 38 are preferably supplied with their own dedicated<br>
battery, other components can be supplied by a battery pack subsystem 36. Because<br>
some of the components require 24-volts while others specify 12-volts, a 24-volt battery<br>
bank with appropriate safety fuses can be wired to provide a 12-volt terminal for<br>
appropriate routing to the auxiliary systems.<br>
The various auxiliary systems are preferably mounted to the operator using a<br>
support system garment such as the vest 20. The vest 20 can be equipped with multiple<br>
pockets each sized to securely house the respective components. The battery packs 36<br>
are preferably positioned in a pocket on the rear of the vest 20 and the cabling,<br>
interconnecting the various components to each other and, through umbilical cables, to<br>
the boom 12, can be routed through the vest 20. Optionally, the vest 20 can be equipped<br>
with various openings on the interiors of the pockets and preferably routing sleeves to<br>
contain the cabling along the interior of the vest 20 to avoid entanglement and damage to<br>
the cabling and potential harm to the operator.<br>
The various auxiliary subsystems and the associated components on the camera<br>
boom 12 can be interconnected by various cabling. The proximal joystick control 58 is<br>
preferably connected to the auxiliary subsystems through a 9-conductor bundle<br>
terminated with a set of three Fatuba-J male and RS232 9-conductor IDC Canon D<br>
connectors. The cabling from the proximal joystick 58 extends along the interior of the<br>
hollow handle tube and connects to the umbilical cables at a break out junction along the<br>
proximal beam module. This joystick control cabling can also provide an additional<br>
break out for optional connection to a distal joystick controller discussed more fully<br>
below. At the beam junction, the motion control cables can connect to the auxiliary<br><br>
systems on the vest through an umbilical cable preferably configured as an RS232 9-<br>
conductor extension which extends to the motion control box 40.<br>
The motion control drive cabling from the motion control box 40 to the pan and<br>
tilt drives is preferably constructed as a 15-conductor ribbon cable terminated with an<br>
RS232 15-conductor IDC technology Canon-D type connector. A tilt drive motor<br>
extension cable can extend from the junction between the motion control drive cable and<br>
the tilt drive motor assembly. The tilt drive control cable extension can also be formed as<br>
a ribbon cable having 6 conductors terminated with twin Fatuba-J connectors.<br>
The camera detector cabling for routing the camera controls and video signals<br>
from the camera unit 26 to the camera control unit 42 is preferably provided by a Hirosi<br>
threaded coupling round connector providing twenty pins and providing a continuous<br>
cabling along the length of the boom and continuing as a camera umbilical to the camera<br>
control unit on the operator vest 20. The battery pack cabling is preferably arranged to<br>
provide ground and plus-24-volt taps as well as a center tap for plus-12-volts. Airtronics<br>
connectors joined for 12 and 24-volt break outs with voltage taps separately keyed by<br>
either the second or third pin of the three pin connectors is preferred to provide a fail-safe<br>
against improper power connections to the auxiliary components. To avoid danger and<br>
potential serious injury to the user, the batteries 36 are preferably fused in the event that a<br>
misrouting of the power causes battery overload or some other condition endangering the<br>
operator.<br>
A 24-volt motion control box power extension cable can be provided and is<br>
preferably constructed as a 22-gauge conductor with a mating keyed power connector at<br>
the motion control back panel, having shield to ground and an Airtronics connector at the<br><br>
battery end. Other cabling arrangements are possible but must preferably be able to<br>
handle 4 amps continuous.<br>
A 12-volt camera control unit power extension can also be provided and<br>
constructed with an Airtronics connector on the battery end and a Hirosi 4-pin power<br>
connector on the camera control unit end. Alternative cabling is possible.<br>
The video signal routed to the camera control unit is then transmitted to the VCR<br>
38 preferably using S-video cabling. The video signal feed is also provided to the<br>
monitor goggles 44 and is preferably routed through RCA video cabling with an<br>
appropriate adaptor.<br>
The goggles 44 are preferably equipped with a tally lamp to monitor the<br>
pause/record status of the VCR. If the goggles are equipped preferably with a 2-color<br>
LED, indicating various VCR status, then a 3-conductor AWG #26 jacketed cabling<br>
terminated at the goggles ends with a 2-color LED red and green connected by a Fatuba-J<br>
connector from the back panel of the motion control box is preferred.<br>
VCR record and pause can be controlled, for example, through the joystick 58 by<br>
way of the motion control box. The motion control panel can provide a control signal to<br>
the VCR 38 through LANC cabling according to established LANC protocol.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, the handle module 14 can optionally be equipped with a<br>
distal or front joystick control 184 in addition to, or instead of, the proximal joystick<br>
control 58. The camera motion or camera operation can then be divided up between the<br>
forward and the rear joystick controls 184,58. For example, one joystick can control tilt<br>
while the other controls pan. Alternatively, one can be dedicated to both pan and tilt<br>
control while the other is dedicated to focus and aperture controls. The joystick can be<br><br>
selected for any of a number of available joystick controls but can preferably include a<br>
subininiature 2 axis-3 channel (2 proportional and 1 switch.) joystick system available<br>
through CH Products. The distal joystick assembly can include a pair of joystick<br>
mounting brackets depending, for example, from the base plate assembly described later<br>
in this specification, each comprised of a series of wood plates including a 1/8-inch thick<br>
standard density 5-ply, a 1/4-inch thick low-density 5-ply, and slotted 1/8-inch thick<br>
standard density 5-ply plate which are epoxy bonded at right angles, with the outboard<br>
most plate of the brackets in a horizontal plane with respect to the beam, normal to the<br>
pan axis and having 1/4-inch wide slots parallel to the longitudinal axis of the beam to<br>
allow longitudinal positional adjustment of subsequent structure depending from the<br>
horizontal plates by means of a 1/4-inch nylon thumb screws and thumb nuts. A second<br>
pair of laterally adjustable plywood plates, preferably constructed of 1/8-inch standard<br>
density 5-ply in the horizontal plane, each having a triplet of parallel 1/4-inch slots<br>
configured in the lateral direction with respect to the length axis of the beam, depend<br>
from the above mounting brackets and allow for lateral and rotational adjustment within<br>
the horizontal plane. The second pair of plates have a joystick mounting fixture located<br>
between them. The fixture is also preferably constructed of 1/8-inch standard density 5-<br>
ply wood and depends from the laterally adjustable plates by means of 1/4-inch nylon<br>
thumb screws and thumb nuts through vertically oriented plates, also 1/8-inch standard<br>
density 5-ply, preferably located at each end of the joystick mounting fixture to allow<br>
tilting adjustment of the joystick mounting fixture.<br>
The base plate assembly can include a pair of plates. The proximal base plate as<br>
illustrated is preferably constructed of one layer of 1/4-inch standard density 5-ply wood<br><br>
with three thin walled stainless steel inserts, each having an inner diameter for size #8<br>
clamping bolts evenly circumferentially spaced around a close tolerance friction fit 7/8-<br>
inch diameter central aperture for the handle tube and reinforced by plain weave E-glass<br>
fiberglass skin lamination on a 45° bias to the vertical center line of the piece on both<br>
faces with a matrix of "Z-Poxy" laminating resin and hardener having a 1 -to-1 room<br>
temperature cure, available from Pacer Technologies. The forward, larger base plate is<br>
preferably made of 1/8-inch thick standard density 5-ply wood with three thin walled<br>
steel inserts in a hole pattern matching those of the smaller base plate, three thick walled<br>
aluminum inserts having oversized clearance inner diameters for the beam module<br>
threaded rods and a hole pattern to match that of the beam module terminal inserts. The<br>
forward base plate also includes a close tolerance, friction fit, 7/8-inch diameter hole for<br>
the handle tube and six large, evenly spaced, mass reduction holes, three clearance holes<br>
for 1/4 inch diameter fasteners evenly spaced around the perimeter (preferably 16<br>
millimeters on center from the edge of the plate) for mounting control componentry such<br>
as the forward joystick assembly, and plain weave E-glass fiberglass skin lamination on a<br>
45° bias to the vertical center line of the piece on both faces, with a matrix of "Z-Poxy"<br>
laminating resin.<br>
