BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTS<br>
Plant growth substances occupy an important place in the growth and developmental processes of all plant species. The pioneers in plant growth substances, Charles Darwin, Boycen-Jensen, and others, recognized that plant growth phenomenon was under control of some chemical substances produced by the plants and in 1928 F. W. Went successfully demonstrated the existence of growth-regulating substances in plants. These compounds are useful for altering a plant's life processes or structure in some beneficial way so as to enhance yield, improve quality or facilitate harvesting. The plant growth hormones, auxins from oat seedlings, and gibberellins from a fungus, and several secondary plant products such as phenolics, lipids, steroids and terpenoids were shown to be responsible for plant growth and development. One class of plant hormone, auxins, and their synthetic mimics are of particular interest. Auxinlike activity is known to affect a number of plant processes, such as cell division, rooting at the basal end of shoots, shoot elongation, apical dominance, phototropic responses and control of abscission of organs such as buds, flowers, fruits, leaves and<br>

The invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are provided<br>
to illustrate the invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example -1: Growth promoting activity of compound 1 using Bacopa sensor<br>
system<br>
For testing the growth promoting effect of Methanone- (3',4',5'-trimethoxy) phenyl,<br>
1-naphthyl, 2-O-4"-ethyl but-2"-enoate, the compounds was dissolved in DMSO and<br>
added into the medium at 1.0 ⁯g/ml. Only solvent was used as control in the<br>
experiment for comparison. A fast propagating strain of Bacopa monnieri developed<br>
as a biosensor system through tissue culture at CIMAP (Khanuja et al 2001, J<br>
Environa Pathol, Toxicol and Onco (JEPTO,), 20:15-22) was used in the tests. The<br>
MS basal<br>
medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962, Physiol.olanta 15: 473 - 497) supplemented<br>
with test compounds was used in the assays. Measured 0.5 to 1.0 ml medium was<br>
poured into 1.5 ml graduated microcentrifuge tubes. Twig cuttings of 2.5 cm were<br>
inoculated in 10 replicates for each treatment. These inoculated tubes were put into a<br>
half transparent dessicator allowing air passage through sterile cotton plugs fixed on<br>
opening vent. The tubes were placed such that the medium-containing portion of the<br>
tubes where roots would be initiating is inserted in to the holes of the stand made from<br>
a thermocol sheet. These dessicators were incubated at normal ambient temperature of<br>
25-28°C with 14 hours light and 10 hours dark cycle. The root initiation, shoot<br>
elongation, callus induction, shoot proliferation and wilting was recorded from day 2<br>
to 14 every 24 hours.<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Example -2: Growth promoting activity of compound 1 using aromatic plant species Mentha arvensis<br>
To confirm the growth promoting activity of Methanone- (3',4',5'-trimethoxy) phenyl, 1- naphthyl, 2-O-4"-ethyl but-2"-enoate, it was tested with a medicinal and aromatic plant species Mentha arvensis. The explants used were 0.5 cm long pieces of the second and third internodes of the shoots formed from axillary buds and culture. The internode segments were inoculated in MS basal media (Murashige and Skoog, 1962, Physiol.olanta 15: 473 - 497) containing vitamins lOOμg/ml, myo-inositol 3%, w/v, sucrose 1.5% w/v, Agar and different concentrations of auxins and cytokinin. Different concentrations of 1- naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) (0.0, 0.2, 2.0 ng/ml) were used in combination with different concentrations of 6 benzyl amino purine (BAP) (0, 10 &amp; 5 μg/ml). On each kind of media 10 replicates of the explants were inoculated into three petriplates with each plates containing 4 explants. The compound 1 was serially replaced with each concentration of NAA and BAP individually to observe its growth promoting activity. The experiment was arranged in the form of a completely randomized design (CRD).<br>
Cultures were maintained at 25 ± 2° C and 400 - 600 lux light intensity with 16 h photoperiod. The response of explants was recorded every 24 h over 4 weeks period. Each explant was observed at 2 weeks interval and sub cultured on same fresh medium. The proportional increase in biomass was recorded by taking the fresh weight of the growing tissue during sub culturing and dividing the increase with the initial weight.<br>
At the end of 12 weeks from inoculation the shoots were separated and individually transferred to MS basal media containing vitamins for rooting. The rooted plantlets were subsequently transferred to pods in a green house. <br>
Composition of Medium A3:<br>
The basal medium for studying the response was MS 0 (Murashige, T., Skoog, F. 1962, Physiol.planta. 15: 473-497) supplemented with 2mg/L IAA (Indole acetic acid) and 10 mg/L BAP (Benzene amino purine).

acid) and 5mg/L BAP (Benzene amino purine).<br>
