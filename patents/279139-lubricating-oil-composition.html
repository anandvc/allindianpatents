LUBRICATING OIL COMPOSITION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition for internal combustion engines, more specifically to a lubricating oil composition for internal combustion engines which is improved in a friction reducing effect, an oxidation stability and a corrosion inhibiting property by using (A) a fatty acid partial ester compound, (B) (bl) an aliphatic amine compound and/or (b2) an acid amide compound, (C) a specific benzotriazole derivative and (D) a specific succinimide compound in combination.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
[0002]<br>
At present, the environment is regulated more and more severely on a global scale, and particularly in situations surrounding automobiles, regulations to fuel consumption, exhaust gases and the like are becoming severer and severer. The above situations are backgrounded by environmental problems such as global warming and the like and resource protection originating in concerns about depletion of oil resources.  It is estimated that saving of fuel consumption in<br>
 <br>
automobiles shall be advanced more and more because of the reasons described above.<br>
[0003]<br>
In saving of fuel consumption in automobiles, important is an improvement in engine oils such as a reduction in a viscosity of engine oils, addition of good friction controlling agents and the like for preventing a frictional loss in engines in addition to an improvement in automobiles themselves such as a reduction in a weight of cars, an improvement in engines and the like. However, a reduction in a viscosity of engine oils is a cause to bring about an increase in friction in the respective parts of an engine, and therefore a friction controlling agent, an extreme pressure agent and the like have to be added for the purposes of reducing a frictional loss caused by the above reduction in a viscosity and preventing wear, and MoDTC and the like which are sulfur-containing compounds and phosphorus-containing compounds are used therefor.  It is known, however, that sulfur-containing compounds and phosphorus-containing compounds deteriorate catalysts clarifying exhaust gases, and it is desirable to reduce sulfur-containing compounds and phosphorus-containing compounds contained in engine oils as much as possible.<br>
[0004]<br>
Further, in diesel engines, countermeasures for reducing environmental pollution caused by exhaust gas components such<br>
 <br>
as particulate matters (granular matters), NOx and the like are important tasks.  It is predominant as the countermeasures therefor to install an exhaust gas clarifying device such as a particulate filter, an exhaust gas clarifying catalyst (oxidation or reduction catalyst) and the like in automobiles. When conventional lubricating oils for internal combustion engines are used for automobiles in which the above exhaust gas clarifying device is installed, soot stuck on a particulate filter is removed by oxidation and combustion, but brought about is the problem that the filter is clogged by metal oxides, phosphates, sulfates, carboxylates and the like which are produced by the combustion. A part of an engine oil used is combusted and exhausted in the form of an exhaust gas. Accordingly, a metal content and a sulfur content in a lubricating oil are preferably reduced as much as possible, and friction controlling agents in place of sulfur- and molybdenum-containing compounds such as MoDTC and the like are desired to be developed.<br>
[0005]<br>
Friction controlling agents other than organic molybdenum compounds such as MoDTC described above include, for example, organic friction reducing agents described in patent documents 1 to 4. Lubricating oils having an excellent friction reducing effect obtained by enhancing a solubility in base oils of organic friction reducing agents are described in the patent document 1. Also, lubricating oil compositions containing<br>
 <br>
specific fatty acid partial ester compounds and specific aliphatic amine compounds are described in the patent documents 2 to 4. The above technical developments have come to make it possible to reduce friction without using molybdenum base (hereinafter referred to as Mo base) friction reducing agents.  In general, however, the above organic friction reducing agents lead to corrosion of metals and oxidative deterioration of lubricating oils, and therefore it is important as well to investigate a composition of lubricating oils based on the above viewpoint.<br>
[0006]<br>
On the other hand, an improvement in engines aiming at saving of fuel consumption described above includes change from a direct strike type to a roller type for the purpose of reducing friction in a valve operating mechanism.  Performances required to engine oils are changed in accordance with the above change, and in recent years, a friction reducing effect in sliding parts other than a valve operating mechanism has come to be strongly requested to engine oils. The parts described above include bearing metals which are sliding parts in main bearings, con'rod bearings and the like, and the materials thereof are spread over various ones such as aluminum, copper, tin, lead and the like without being limited to iron.  These copper- and lead-containing compounds have the excellent characteristic that they have less fatigue phenomenon, but on the other hand, a problem of corrosion<br>
 <br>
caused by engine oils has been involved therein.<br>

An upper limit thereof shall not specifically be restricted, and the total amount of the fatty acid partial ester compound (A) and the component (B) is 1.5 % by mass or less from the viewpoints of the economical efficiency, the metal corrosion property and an oxidative deterioration of the lubricating oil. [0032]<br>
In the present invention, the component (A) and the component (B) described above are used in combination. More<br>
1 6<br>
 <br>
excellent friction reducing effect than in using them alone is obtained by using both components in combination. A total amount thereof is 0.5 to 1.5 % by mass, preferably 0,6 to 1.2 % by mass in terms of the friction reducing effect.  If it is less than 0.5 % by mass, the satisfactory friction reducing effect is not obtained, and if it exceeds 1.5 % by mass, the friction reducing effect meeting the amount is not obtained. [0033]<br>
A friction reducing effect with which the component (A) and the component (B) are endowed is synergistically enhanced by using both components in combination. On the other hand, however, the metal corrosion property to metal and an oxidative deterioration of the lubricating oil tend to be enhanced as well more than in using them alone by using both components in combination.  From the above point of view, a total amount of the component (A) and the component (B) is 1.5 % by mass or less.  If it is 1.5 % by mass or less, the metal corrosion property and the oxidative deterioration described above are avoided. [0034]<br>
In the present invention, the metal corrosion property and the oxidative deterioration can further be inhibited by blending a metal inactivation agent in addition to limitation of a total amount of the component (A) and the component (B) described above, and the lubricating oil composition in which a friction reducing effect, an oxidation stability and a<br>
1 7<br>
 <br>
corrosion inhibiting effect are enhanced in a balanced manner can be obtained. The metal inactivation agent includes, for example, benzotriazole base, tolyltriazole base, thiadiazole base, imidazole base and pyrimidine base compounds and the like. Among them, the benzotriazole base compounds are preferred.<br>
The benzotriazole base compound includes (C) a benzotriazole derivative represented by Formula (I):<br>
[0035] [Ka 3]<br>
 <br>
 <br>
(I)<br>
 <br>
[0036] in Formula (I), R^ and R^ each are independently a hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 2 to 18 carbon atoms, and especially preferably 3 to 18 carbon atoms. The above hydrocarbyl group may be any of linear, branched and cyclic groups and may contain an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a nitrogen atom.  R and R^ may be the same as or different from each other.<br>

 <br>
The benzotriazole derivative (C) described above is added in an amount of preferably 0.01 to 0.1 % by mass, more preferably 0.03 to 0.05 % by mass in terms of an effect thereof. The benzotriazole derivative (C) may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds thereof. Further, it may be used in combination with other metal inactivation agents,<br>
[0038]<br>
In the present invention, (D) a succinimide compound represented by Formula (II) or Formula (III) is used as a dispersant:<br>

[0040] in Formula (II) and Formula (III), R^, R^ and R^ each are an alkenyl group or an alkyl group having a number average molecular weight of 500 to 3,000, and R^ and R^ may be the same or different; a number average molecular weight of R"^, R^ and R® is preferably 1,000 to 3,000; R\   R'  and R^ each are an alkylene group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms, and R' and R® may be the same or different; r represents an integer of 1 to 10; and s represents 0 or an integer of 1 to 10.<br>
If a number average molecular weight of R^, R^ and R^ is less than 500, the solubility in the base oil is reduced.

 <br>
carried out at a test temperature of 100°C, a load of 200 g, an amplitude of 10 mm and a sliding speed of 1.0 mm/second, and a friction coefficient obtained was set to an index for a fuel consumption saving property.<br>
The friction coefficient reducing rate was determined from the following equation on the basis of a friction coefficient in a no friction controlling agent-added sample (Comparative Example 1): friction coefficient reducing rate (%) = (friction coefficient of Comparative Example 1) - (friction coefficient in the example or the comparative example)/(friction coefficient of Comparative Example 1) X 100 [0066] Oxidative deterioration test:<br>
A glass-made test tube was charged with 120 g of the sample, copper (25 mm X lo mm X 0.5 mm) and iron (25 mm X 30 mm X 0.5 mm), and air (500 ml/minute) was blown thereinto at 165.5°C to cause oxidative deterioration. After 216 hours, the kinematic viscosity at 40°C was measured to determine the viscosity increase rate.  Further, an amount of copper in the test oil was measured. Less increase in the viscosity shows that the sample is more excellent in an oxidation stability. Also, less elution amount of copper shows that the sample exerts less influence on copper and that it has more excellent characteristic to metal materials. [0067]<br>

Less elution amount of lead shows that the sample exerts less influence on lead and that it has more excellent characteristic to metal materials. [0068]<br>

[0071]<br>
In the chromium plating treatment test ball, the friction coefficient reducing rate shows a high value of 25 % or more in the examples, and an effect of reducing a friction coefficient is shown in the lubricating oil composition of the present invention. It is suggested in Example 1 and Comparative Examples 2 to 5 that the above effect is provided by a synergistic effect of the component (A) and the component (B) . The same tendency is observed as well in the test ball subjected to nitride treatment, chromium nitride (PVD) treatment or DLC (containing hydrogen 20 %) treatment.<br>
A relation of the contents of the component (A) and the component (B) with the friction coefficient reducing effect is found from the results shown in Examples 1 to 2 and Comparative Example 6. An effect meeting the addition amount is not obtained in Comparative Example 6 as compared with Examples 1 to 2.  Further, in Comparative Example 6, high values are shown in the oxidative deterioration test and the lead corrosion test of the lubricating oil composition, and a negative effect brought about by adding the component (A) and the component (B) results in being markedly shown.<br>
Also, as shown in Example 2 and Comparative Example 7, inhibition of the oxidative deterioration and the lead corrosion is further achieved by adding the benzotriazole compound (C).<br>
Further, comparison of Examples 1 to 5 with Comparative<br>
4 3<br>
 <br>
Example 8 shows that the results obtained in Comparative Example 8 are inferior to a large extent in the lead corrosion test and the oxidative deterioration test. This is considered to originate in a difference of the imide compounds, and the above effect is obtained by a regulated content of the polybutenylsuccinbisimide compound (dl) containing a polybutenyl group having a number average molecular weight of 1,500 or more based on a whole amount of the succinimide compound (D) and a regulated nitrogen content of the component (dl) based on a whole nitrogen amount of the succinimide compound (D). [0072]<br>
As shown above, the present invention has been completed by making use of an excellent friction reducing effect obtained by a synergistic effect of the component (A) and the component (B) and inhibiting the negative effects such as oxidative deterioration and lead corrosion which are brought about by using them in combination by numerical limitation in the contents of the component (A) and the component (B) and addition of the specific benzotriazole derivative (C) and the specific succinimide compound (D) .<br>
