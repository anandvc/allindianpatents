NUCLEIC ACID ADJUVANTS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to the fields of molecular biology and immunology,<br>
5	and generally relates to nucleic acid immunization techniques. More specincaliy,<br>
the invention relates to polynucleotides encoding an adjuvant, and to immunization strategies employing sucholynucleocides.<br>
Background<br>
] 0	Techniques for the injection of DNA and mRNA into mammalian tissue<br>
for the purposes of immunization against an expression product have been described in the art.   The techniques, termed "nucleic acid immunization" herein, have been shown to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. For example, sera from mice immunized with a DNA construct encoding the<br>
15	envelope glycoprotein, gpl60, were shown to react with recombinant gpl60 in<br>
immunoassays, and lymphocytes from the injected mice were shown to proliferate in response to recombinant gpI20. Wang et al, (1993) Proc. Nad, Acad. Sci USA 90:4156-4160. Similarly, mice immumzed with a human growth hormone (hGH) gene demonstrated an antibody-based immune response. Tang et<br>
20	al. (1992) Nature 356:152-154. Intramuscular injection of DNA encoding<br>
influenza nucleoprotein driven by a mammalian promoter has been shown to elicit a CDS+ CTL response that can protect mice against subsequent lethal challenge with virus. Ulmer et al. (1993) Science 259:1745-1749. Immunohistochemical studies of the injection site revealed that the DNA was<br>
25	taken up by myeloblasts, and cvtoplasmic production of viral protein could be<br>
demonsurated for at least 6 months.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is a primarv object of the invention to provide a polynucleotide adjuvant<br>
30	composition containing furst and second nucleic acid sequences, wherein the first<br>
nucleic acid secuence is a trucated A subunit coding region obtained or derived<br>
1<br><br><br>
from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and the second nucleic acid sequence<br>
is a truncated B subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-<br>
ribosylating exotoxin. Each of the truncated subunit coding regions has a 5'<br>
deletion and encodes a subunit peptide not having an amino terminal bacterial<br>
5	signal peptide.<br>
The first and second nucleic acid sequences maybe present in the same or<br>
in different nucleic acid constructs. The troncated subunit cod'lng regions may be<br>
obtained or derived from the same bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin and. in<br>
cer.ain preferred embodiments, the bacterial .ADP-ribosylating exotoxin is a<br>
10	cholera toxin (CT) or an E, coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT). In addition, at least<br>
W<br>
one of the truncated subunit coding regions maybe genetically modified to detoxify the subunit peptide encoded thereby, for example wherem the tnmcated A submiit coding region has been genetically modified to disrupt or inacrivate -ADP-ribosyl transferase activity in the subunit peptide expression product.<br>
15	It is also a primary object of the invention to provide a polynucleoride<br>
adjuvant composition contaimng first and second nucleic acid sequences, wherein the first nucleic acid sequence is a modified A subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial .ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and the second nucleic acid sequence is a B subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial AD?-<br>
20	ribosylating exotoxin. The modified A subunit coding region and said B subunit<br>
coding region each encode a mature subunit peptide, and the modified A subunit coding region has been genetically modified so as to delete a C-terminaJ KDEL or RDEL motif in the subunit peptide encoded thereby.<br>
As above, the first and second nucleic acid sequences may be present in<br>
25	the same or in different nucleic acid constructs. The truncated subunit coding<br>
regions may be obtained or derived from the same bacterial .ADP-ribosylaring exoioxin and, in certain preferred embodiments, the bac:erial .ADP-ribosylating exotoxin is a cholera toxin (CT) or an E. ccAi heat labile eriterotoxin ('LT).  In addition, at least one of the truncated subunit coding regions may be genetically modified to detoxify the subunit peptide encoded therby for example wherem the truncated A subunit coding region has been genetically modified :o disrupt or<br><br>
y<br><br>
inactivate ADP-ribosyl transferase activity in the subnnit peptide expression product.<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, the above compositions can be<br>
provided in particulate form, for example wherein the compositions are<br>
5	particulates suitable for deliver/ from a particle delivery device. In this regard,<br>
the present compositions may be coated onto the same or a different core carrier particle and thus suitable for delivery using a particle-mediated transfection technique. Preferred core carrier particies will have an average diameter of about 0.1 to 10 µm, and may comprise a metal such as gold. Accordingly, it is a still<br>
10	further object of the invention to provide a particle delivery device loaded with<br>
4	(e.g., containing) a particulate composition as defined herein.<br>
It is also a primary object of the invention.to provide for the use of a composition containing a first and second nucleic acid sequence, where each sequence includes a coding region for a subunit from a bacterial ADP-<br>
15	ribosylating exotoxin in the manufacmre of a medicament for enhancing an<br>
immime response in a vertebrate subject against an antigen of interest in the said subject. The antigen of interest and the composition are administered to the subject such that the toxin subunits encoded by the first and second nucleic acid sequences are expressed in an amount sufncient to elicit an enhanced immime<br>
20	response against the antigen. The first nucleic acid sequence contains a truncated<br>
A subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating<br>
exotoxin, and the second nucleic acid sequence contains a turncated B subunit<br>
^"^	coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin,<br>
however with the proviso that each of the truncated subunit coding regions has a<br>
25	5' deletion and encodes a subunit peptide not having an amino terminal bacterial<br>
signal peptide.<br>
It is a related primary object of the invention to provide a method for enhancing an immume resnonse asainst an antigen of interest in a subiect. The method generally entails: (a) administering the antigen of interest to the subject;<br>
30	(b) providing an adjuvant composition compnsing first and second nucleic acid<br>
sequences, wherein the first nucleic acid sequence is a truncated A subunit coding<br><br><br><br>
region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and the<br>
second nucleic acid sequence is a truncated B subunit coding region obtained or<br>
derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin; and (c) administering the<br>
adjuvant composition to the subject, whereby upon introduction to tlie subject,<br>
5	the first and second nucleic acid sequences are expressed to provide subunit<br>
peptides in an amount sufficient to elicit an enhanced immune response agahist the antigen of interest. The subunit coding regions are trancated in that each coding region has a 5' deletion and encodes a subunit ::eoiide not having an amino terminal bacterial signal peptide.<br>
10	It is yet a farther primary object of the invention to provide for the use of<br>
a composition comprising a first and second nucleic acid sequence, where each sequence includes a coding region for a subunit fi-om a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin in the m.anufacture of a medicament for enhancing an immime response in a vensbrate subject against an antigen of interest in the said<br>
15	subject. The antigen of interest and the composition are administered to the<br>
subject such that the toxin subunits encoded by the first and second nucleic acid sequences are expressed in an amcimt sufrlcient to ehcit an erJianced irmnune<br>
20 25 <br><br><br>
second nucleic acid sequence is a B subunit coding region obtained or derived<br>
from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin; and (c) administering the adjuvant<br>
composition to the subject, whereby upon introduction to the subject, the first and<br>
second nucleic acid sequences are expressed to provide subunit peptides in an<br>
5	amount sufficient to elicit an enhanced immune response against the antigen of<br>
interest. The subunit coding regions are modified in that each encodes a mature subunit peptide, but the A subunit coding region has been genetically modified so as :o delete a C-:erminal IGDEL or RDEL motif in the subunit peptide encoded thereby.<br>
10	In the uses and methods of the invention, administering the adjuvant<br>
comnositions entails transfecting cells of the subject with a polynucleotide adjuvant composirion according to the present invention. Expression cassettes and/or vectors containing the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be used to transfect the cells, and transfection is carried out under conditions that<br>
15	pennit expression of the subunit peptides within the subject. The method may<br>
farther entail one or more steps of administering at least one secondary composition to the subject.<br>
The transfection procedure carried out during the immunization can be conducted either in vivo, or ex vivo (e.g., to obtain transfected cells which are<br>
20	subsequently introduced into the subject prior to carrying out the secondary<br>
immunizadon step). When in vivo transfection is used, the nucleic acid molecules can be administered to the subject by way of intramuscular or intradermal injection of plasmid DNA or, preferably, administered to the subject using a particle-mediated delivery technique. Vaccine compositions (containing<br>
25	the antigen of interest) can be provided in the form of any suitable vaccine<br>
composition, for example, in the form of a peptide subunit composition, in the form, of a nucleic acid vaccine composition, or in the form of a whole or split virus influenza vaccine composition.<br>
In certain methods, the antigen of interest and the adjuvant composition<br>
30	are administered to the same site in the subject. For example, the adjuvant<br>
composition and the antigen of interest can be administred concurrently (e.g.,<br>
5<br><br><br>
provided in a single vaccine composition). In certain preferred embodiments, the adjuvant and, optionally the antigen of interest, is administered in particulate form, for example wherein the adjuvant composition has been coated onto a core carrier particle and delivered to the subject using a particle-mediated deliver/<br>
5	technique.<br>
In these methods, administration of the polyr.uclectide adjuvant<br>
compositions of the present invention preferably results in an augmented cellular<br>
immune response against the co-administered antigen of interest. Such an<br>
enhanced immune response may be generally characterized by increased titers of<br>
10	inrerferon-producing OD4 and/or CDS* T lymphocytes, increased antigen-<br>
	specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and a T helper 1-like immmune<br>
response (Thl) against the antigen of interest (characterized by increased antigen-specific antibody titers of the subclasses typically associated with cellular<br><br><br><br>
(hCMV) immediate early promoter and associated intron A sequence, and the<br>
coding sequence for the signal peptide of human tissue plasminogen activator co<br>

Definitioas<br>
10	Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br><br>
have the same meaning as commonly understood bv one of ordinary skill in the an to which the invention pertains. Although a number of methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are described herein.<br>
15	In describing the present invention, the following terms will be employed,<br>
and are intended to be defined as indicated below.<br>
The term 'adjuvant" intends any material or composition capable of specifically or non-specifically altering, enhancing, directing, redirecting, potentiating or initiating an antigen-specific immune response. Thus,<br>
20	coadministration of an adjuvant with an antigen may result in a lower dose or<br>
fewer doses of antigen being necessary to achieve a desired immune response in<br><br>
the subject to which the antigen is administered, or coadmiristration may result in<br>
f	...<br>
a qualitatively and'or quantitatively different immune response in the subject.<br>
25 30 <br><br>
^■f^^ll^<br><br><br>
An "adjuvant composition" intends any phannaceutical composition<br>
containing an adjuvant Adjuvant compositions can be delivered in the methods<br>
of the invention while in any suitable phannaceutical fonn, for example, as a<br>
liquid, powder, cream, lotion, emulsion, gel or the like. However, preferred<br>
5	adjuvant compositions will be in particulate form. It is intended, although not<br>
always explicitly stated, that molecules havmg similar biological activity as witd-type or purified peptide or chemical adjuvants.<br><br><br><br>
For purposes of the present invention, a 'humoral immune response" refers to an<br>
immune response mediated by antibody molecules, while a "cellular immune<br>
response" is one mediated by T-lymphocytes and/'cr ocher white blood ceils.<br>
The term 'nucleic acid immunization" is used herein to refer to the<br>
5	iniroducrion of a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more selected antigens<br>
into a host cell for the in vivo expression of the antigen or antigens. The term also encompasses introduction of a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more selected adjuvants into a host cell for the in vnvo expression of the adjuvanta or adjuvants.   The nucleic acid molecule can be introduced directly into the<br><br><br><br>
a central processing unit and used for bioinfonnatics applications such as functional genomics and homology searching.<br>
A "vector" is capable of transferring nucleic acid sequences to target cells<br>
(e.g., viral vectors, non-viral vectors, particulate carriers, and liposomes).<br>
5	Typically. 'Vector constructy' "expression vector," and "gene transfer vector."<br>
mean any nucleic acid construct capable of directing the expression of a gene of<br>
interest and which can transfer gene sequences to target cells. Thus, the term<br>
includes cloning and expression vehicles, as well as viral vectors. A 'plasmid' is<br>
a vector in the form of an extrachromosomal genetic element.<br>
10	A nucleic acid sequence which "encodes" a selected adjuvant and/or<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
effecting the expression of that sequence when the proper enzymes are present.<br>
The promoter need not be contiguous with the sequence, so long as it functions to<br>
direct the expression thereof Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet<br>
transcribed sequences can be present between the promoter sequence and the<br>
5	nucleic acid sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered<br>
'operabiy linked" to the coding sequence.<br>
'Recombinant" is used herein to describe a nucleic acid molecule<br>
(polynucleotide) of genomic, cDNA, semisyathetic, or syntheric or.gin whihc  by<br>
virtue of its origin or manipulation is not associated with all or a pordon of the<br>
10	polynucleotide with which it is associated in nature and/or is linked to a<br>
polynucleotide other than that to which it is linked in nature. Two nucieic acid sequences which are contained within a single recombinanr nucleic acid molecule are 'heterologous" relative to each other when they are not normally associated with each other in nature.<br><br><br><br>
whether nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, is the number of exact matches<br>
between two aligned sequences divided by the length of the shorter sequences and<br>
multiplied by 100. An approximate alignment for nucleic acid sequences is<br>
provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Advances in<br>
5	Applied Mathematics 2:482-489 (1981). This algorithm can be applied to amino<br>
acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Davhoff. Atlas of<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, homology can be determined by hybridization of<br>
polynucleotides under conditions which form stable duplexes between<br>
homologous regions, followed by digestion with singie-stranded-specific<br>

By "core carrier" is meant a carrier on which a guest nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RSA) is coated in order to impart a denned particle size as well as a sufficiently high density to achieve the momentum required for cell membrane penetration, such that the guest molecule can be delivered using panicle-mediated<br><br><br><br><br><br>
that this invention is not limited to particular formulations or process parameters<br>
as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used<br>
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodimenis of the invention<br>
only, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
5	The present invention provides novel compositions containing nucleic<br>
acid sequences, wherein a first sequence in the composition is a coding sequence<br>
lor an A subunit obtained or derived from an ADP-ribosylating baccerial toxin,<br>
and a second sequence in the composition is a coding sequence for a B subunit<br>
obtained or derived from an .ADP-ribosyiating bacterial toxin. The fust and<br>
10	second sequences are useful in immunization methods wherein they are delivered<br><br><br><br>
extremely similar molecules, and are at least about 70-80% homologous at the<br>
amino acid level.<br>
The CT and LT toxins are hexamers, composed of a single molecule of an<br>
A subunit surrounded by a doughnut-shaped ring composed of 5 molecules of the<br>
5	3 subunit. The A subunit possesses an ADP-ribosylase activity resulting in G<br>
protein modifications that lead to cAMP and protein Idnase A upregulation following  internlization of the A subunit in a manmrialian cell. The A subunit can be nicked by exogenous proteases yielding the Al and A2 fragments linlced via a single disulfide bridge. The A subunit of CT contains a C-terminal KDEL<br><br><br><br>
triggering activity, respectively. Regarding the B subunit of LT in particular,<br>
binding to the GMl receptor on B cells results in polyclonal activation, occurs in<br>
the absence of signiiicant proliferation, and involves the upregulation c: a<br>
number of important molecules such as MHC class II, B7, CD40, ICAM-1 and<br>
5	IL2-Ra. For T cells, addition of CT or LT holotoxins or recombinant 3 subunits<br><br><br><br>
is a coding region for a modified, mature A subunit peptide obtained or derived<br>
from an ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and (b) the second nucleic acid sequence is a<br>
coding region for a mature B subunit peptide obtained or derived from an ADP-<br>
ribosylating exotoxin. The first nucleic acid sequence contains a coding region<br>
5	that provides for a "modified" A subunit peptide in that the said coding  region<br>
has been genetically altered so as to delete a four amino acid residue C-termnai KDEL or RDZL motif normally found in the encoded subumil peotide.<br>
In still a further embodiment, a composition is provided which includes<br><br><br><br>
aspects of the invention, one or both of the toxin subunit peptide coding regions<br>
can be further genetically modified to detoxify rhe subunit peptide(s) encoded<br>
thereby. For example, genetically altered toxin mutants which have disrupted<br>
A\DP-ribcsylat:ng acnviry, tripsin cleavage site mutations, or disrapted birding<br>
5	activity are known in the art. See, e.g., Burnetts at al. (1994) 'Recombinant<br>
n"iicrobial ADP-ribosylating toxins of Bordetella peniisis. Vibrio ckolerae. ana enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli: structure, function and toxoid vaccine<br><br><br><br>
prime the replication reaction. The product of the first round of replication is<br>
itself a template for subsequent replication, thus repeated successive cycles of<br>
replication result in geometric amplification of the DNA fragment delimited by<br>
the primer pair used,<br>
5	Once the relevant sequences for the ADP-ribosylating exotoxin subunits<br>
of mterest have been obtained, they can be linked together to provide one or mors conuguous nucleic acid molecules using standard cloning or molecular biology techniques. More particularly, after sequence information for the selected toxin subunit combination has been obtained, the coding sequences can be combined<br><br><br>
w<br><br><br><br>
vectors which include control sequences operably linked to the inserted sequence or sequences, thus providing expression cassettes that allow for expression of the toxin subunit peptides in vivo in a targeted subject species.<br><br><br><br>
exotoxin subunit peptide coding sequences of interest, the expression cassettes can be provided in a suitable transfection vector such as a DNA plasmid vector or a viral vector for subsequent administration to a subject.. In this regard, the polynuclectide compositions of the invention can be used as standalone adjuvant<br><br><br><br>
lower or fewer doses of the antigen are required to generate an eScient immune response.<br>
As used herein, the term 'cc-administered' such as when an AD?-<br>

the genes of the virus but cannot package its own genome due to a deletion of the<br>

the invention relates to polynucleotides encoding an adjuvant, and to immunization strategies employing sucholynucleocides.<br>
Background<br>
] 0	Techniques for the injection of DNA and mRNA into mammalian tissue<br>
for the purposes of immunization against an expression product have been described in the art.   The techniques, termed "nucleic acid immunization" herein, have been shown to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. For example, sera from mice immunized with a DNA construct encoding the<br>
15	envelope glycoprotein, gpl60, were shown to react with recombinant gpl60 in<br>
immunoassays, and lymphocytes from the injected mice were shown to proliferate in response to recombinant gpI20. Wang et al, (1993) Proc. Nad, Acad. Sci USA 90:4156-4160. Similarly, mice immumzed with a human growth hormone (hGH) gene demonstrated an antibody-based immune response. Tang et<br>

influenza nucleoprotein driven by a mammalian promoter has been shown to elicit a CDS+ CTL response that can protect mice against subsequent lethal challenge with virus. Ulmer et al. (1993) Science 259:1745-1749. Immunohistochemical studies of the injection site revealed that the DNA was<br>

It is a primarv object of the invention to provide a polynucleotide adjuvant<br>
30	composition containing furst and second nucleic acid sequences, wherein the first<br>
nucleic acid secuence is a trucated A subunit coding region obtained or derived<br>

from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and the second nucleic acid sequence<br>
is a truncated B subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-<br>
ribosylating exotoxin. Each of the truncated subunit coding regions has a 5'<br>
deletion and encodes a subunit peptide not having an amino terminal bacterial<br>
5	signal peptide.<br>
The first and second nucleic acid sequences maybe present in the same or<br>
in different nucleic acid constructs. The troncated subunit cod'lng regions may be<br>
obtained or derived from the same bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin and. in<br>
cer.ain preferred embodiments, the bacterial .ADP-ribosylating exotoxin is a<br>
10	cholera toxin (CT) or an E, coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT). In addition, at least<br>
W<br>
one of the truncated subunit coding regions maybe genetically modified to detoxify the subunit peptide encoded thereby, for example wherem the tnmcated A submiit coding region has been genetically modified to disrupt or inacrivate -ADP-ribosyl transferase activity in the subunit peptide expression product.<br>
15	It is also a primary object of the invention to provide a polynucleoride<br>

20	ribosylating exotoxin. The modified A subunit coding region and said B subunit<br>
coding region each encode a mature subunit peptide, and the modified A subunit coding region has been genetically modified so as to delete a C-terminaJ KDEL or RDEL motif in the subunit peptide encoded thereby.<br>
As above, the first and second nucleic acid sequences may be present in<br>
25	the same or in different nucleic acid constructs. The truncated subunit coding<br>
regions may be obtained or derived from the same bacterial .ADP-ribosylaring exoioxin and, in certain preferred embodiments, the bac:erial .ADP-ribosylating exotoxin is a cholera toxin (CT) or an E. ccAi heat labile eriterotoxin ('LT).  In addition, at least one of the truncated subunit coding regions may be genetically modified to detoxify the subunit peptide encoded therby for example wherem the truncated A subunit coding region has been genetically modified :o disrupt or<br><br>
y<br><br>
inactivate ADP-ribosyl transferase activity in the subnnit peptide expression product.<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, the above compositions can be<br>

5	particulates suitable for deliver/ from a particle delivery device. In this regard,<br>
the present compositions may be coated onto the same or a different core carrier particle and thus suitable for delivery using a particle-mediated transfection technique. Preferred core carrier particies will have an average diameter of about 0.1 to 10 µm, and may comprise a metal such as gold. Accordingly, it is a still<br>

The antigen of interest and the composition are administered to the subject such that the toxin subunits encoded by the first and second nucleic acid sequences are expressed in an amount sufncient to elicit an enhanced immime<br>
20	response against the antigen. The first nucleic acid sequence contains a truncated<br>
A subunit coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating<br>
exotoxin, and the second nucleic acid sequence contains a turncated B subunit<br>
^"^	coding region obtained or derived from a bacterial ADP-ribosylating exotoxin,<br>
however with the proviso that each of the truncated subunit coding regions has a<br>
25	5' deletion and encodes a subunit peptide not having an amino terminal bacterial<br>
signal peptide.<br>
It is a related primary object of the invention to provide a method for enhancing an immume resnonse asainst an antigen of interest in a subiect. The method generally entails: (a) administering the antigen of interest to the subject;<br>
30	(b) providing an adjuvant composition compnsing first and second nucleic acid<br>

peptides in an amount sufficient to elicit an enhanced immune response agahist the antigen of interest. The subunit coding regions are trancated in that each coding region has a 5' deletion and encodes a subunit ::eoiide not having an amino terminal bacterial signal peptide.<br>
10	It is yet a farther primary object of the invention to provide for the use of<br>

15	subject. The antigen of interest and the composition are administered to the<br>
subject such that the toxin subunits encoded by the first and second nucleic acid sequences are expressed in an amcimt sufrlcient to ehcit an erJianced irmnune<br>

interest. The subunit coding regions are modified in that each encodes a mature subunit peptide, but the A subunit coding region has been genetically modified so as :o delete a C-:erminal IGDEL or RDEL motif in the subunit peptide encoded thereby.<br>
10	In the uses and methods of the invention, administering the adjuvant<br>
comnositions entails transfecting cells of the subject with a polynucleotide adjuvant composirion according to the present invention. Expression cassettes and/or vectors containing the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be used to transfect the cells, and transfection is carried out under conditions that<br>
15	pennit expression of the subunit peptides within the subject. The method may<br>

The transfection procedure carried out during the immunization can be conducted either in vivo, or ex vivo (e.g., to obtain transfected cells which are<br>
20	subsequently introduced into the subject prior to carrying out the secondary<br>
immunizadon step). When in vivo transfection is used, the nucleic acid molecules can be administered to the subject by way of intramuscular or intradermal injection of plasmid DNA or, preferably, administered to the subject using a particle-mediated delivery technique. Vaccine compositions (containing<br>
25	the antigen of interest) can be provided in the form of any suitable vaccine<br>
composition, for example, in the form of a peptide subunit composition, in the form, of a nucleic acid vaccine composition, or in the form of a whole or split virus influenza vaccine composition.<br>
In certain methods, the antigen of interest and the adjuvant composition<br>
30	are administered to the same site in the subject. For example, the adjuvant<br>
composition and the antigen of interest can be administred concurrently (e.g.,<br>
5<br><br><br>
provided in a single vaccine composition). In certain preferred embodiments, the adjuvant and, optionally the antigen of interest, is administered in particulate form, for example wherein the adjuvant composition has been coated onto a core carrier particle and delivered to the subject using a particle-mediated deliver/<br>
5	technique.<br>
In these methods, administration of the polyr.uclectide adjuvant<br>
compositions of the present invention preferably results in an augmented cellular<br>
immune response against the co-administered antigen of interest. Such an<br>
enhanced immune response may be generally characterized by increased titers of<br>
10	inrerferon-producing OD4 and/or CDS* T lymphocytes, increased antigen-<br>
	specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity, and a T helper 1-like immmune<br>
response (Thl) against the antigen of interest (characterized by increased antigen-specific antibody titers of the subclasses typically associated with cellular<br><br><br><br>

Definitioas<br>
10	Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein<br><br>
have the same meaning as commonly understood bv one of ordinary skill in the an to which the invention pertains. Although a number of methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are described herein.<br>
15	In describing the present invention, the following terms will be employed,<br>
and are intended to be defined as indicated below.<br>
The term 'adjuvant" intends any material or composition capable of specifically or non-specifically altering, enhancing, directing, redirecting, potentiating or initiating an antigen-specific immune response. Thus,<br>
20	coadministration of an adjuvant with an antigen may result in a lower dose or<br>
fewer doses of antigen being necessary to achieve a desired immune response in<br><br>
the subject to which the antigen is administered, or coadmiristration may result in<br>
f	...<br>
a qualitatively and'or quantitatively different immune response in the subject.<br>

^■f^^ll^<br><br><br>
An "adjuvant composition" intends any phannaceutical composition<br>
containing an adjuvant Adjuvant compositions can be delivered in the methods<br>
of the invention while in any suitable phannaceutical fonn, for example, as a<br>
liquid, powder, cream, lotion, emulsion, gel or the like. However, preferred<br>
5	adjuvant compositions will be in particulate form. It is intended, although not<br>
always explicitly stated, that molecules havmg similar biological activity as witd-type or purified peptide or chemical adjuvants.<br><br><br><br>
For purposes of the present invention, a 'humoral immune response" refers to an<br>
immune response mediated by antibody molecules, while a "cellular immune<br>
response" is one mediated by T-lymphocytes and/'cr ocher white blood ceils.<br>
The term 'nucleic acid immunization" is used herein to refer to the<br>
5	iniroducrion of a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more selected antigens<br>
into a host cell for the in vivo expression of the antigen or antigens. The term also encompasses introduction of a nucleic acid molecule encoding one or more selected adjuvants into a host cell for the in vnvo expression of the adjuvanta or adjuvants.   The nucleic acid molecule can be introduced directly into the<br><br><br><br>
a central processing unit and used for bioinfonnatics applications such as functional genomics and homology searching.<br>
A "vector" is capable of transferring nucleic acid sequences to target cells<br>
(e.g., viral vectors, non-viral vectors, particulate carriers, and liposomes).<br>
5	Typically. 'Vector constructy' "expression vector," and "gene transfer vector."<br>
mean any nucleic acid construct capable of directing the expression of a gene of<br>
interest and which can transfer gene sequences to target cells. Thus, the term<br>
includes cloning and expression vehicles, as well as viral vectors. A 'plasmid' is<br>
a vector in the form of an extrachromosomal genetic element.<br>
10	A nucleic acid sequence which "encodes" a selected adjuvant and/or<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
effecting the expression of that sequence when the proper enzymes are present.<br>
The promoter need not be contiguous with the sequence, so long as it functions to<br>
direct the expression thereof Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet<br>
transcribed sequences can be present between the promoter sequence and the<br>
5	nucleic acid sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered<br>
'operabiy linked" to the coding sequence.<br>
'Recombinant" is used herein to describe a nucleic acid molecule<br>
(polynucleotide) of genomic, cDNA, semisyathetic, or syntheric or.gin whihc  by<br>
virtue of its origin or manipulation is not associated with all or a pordon of the<br>
10	polynucleotide with which it is associated in nature and/or is linked to a<br>
polynucleotide other than that to which it is linked in nature. Two nucieic acid sequences which are contained within a single recombinanr nucleic acid molecule are 'heterologous" relative to each other when they are not normally associated with each other in nature.<br><br><br><br>
whether nucleic acid or amino acid sequences, is the number of exact matches<br>
between two aligned sequences divided by the length of the shorter sequences and<br>
multiplied by 100. An approximate alignment for nucleic acid sequences is<br>
provided by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Advances in<br>
5	Applied Mathematics 2:482-489 (1981). This algorithm can be applied to amino<br>
acid sequences by using the scoring matrix developed by Davhoff. Atlas of<br><br><br><br>
Alternatively, homology can be determined by hybridization of<br>
polynucleotides under conditions which form stable duplexes between<br>
homologous regions, followed by digestion with singie-stranded-specific<br>
nucleasels), and size determination of the digested fragmens. Two DNA, or two<br>

By "core carrier" is meant a carrier on which a guest nucleic acid (e.g., DNA, RSA) is coated in order to impart a denned particle size as well as a sufficiently high density to achieve the momentum required for cell membrane penetration, such that the guest molecule can be delivered using panicle-mediated<br><br><br><br><br><br>
that this invention is not limited to particular formulations or process parameters<br>
as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used<br>
herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodimenis of the invention<br>
only, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
5	The present invention provides novel compositions containing nucleic<br>
acid sequences, wherein a first sequence in the composition is a coding sequence<br>
lor an A subunit obtained or derived from an ADP-ribosylating baccerial toxin,<br>
and a second sequence in the composition is a coding sequence for a B subunit<br>
obtained or derived from an .ADP-ribosyiating bacterial toxin. The fust and<br>
10	second sequences are useful in immunization methods wherein they are delivered<br><br><br><br>
extremely similar molecules, and are at least about 70-80% homologous at the<br>
amino acid level.<br>
The CT and LT toxins are hexamers, composed of a single molecule of an<br>
A subunit surrounded by a doughnut-shaped ring composed of 5 molecules of the<br>
5	3 subunit. The A subunit possesses an ADP-ribosylase activity resulting in G<br>
protein modifications that lead to cAMP and protein Idnase A upregulation following  internlization of the A subunit in a manmrialian cell. The A subunit can be nicked by exogenous proteases yielding the Al and A2 fragments linlced via a single disulfide bridge. The A subunit of CT contains a C-terminal KDEL<br><br><br><br>
triggering activity, respectively. Regarding the B subunit of LT in particular,<br>
binding to the GMl receptor on B cells results in polyclonal activation, occurs in<br>
the absence of signiiicant proliferation, and involves the upregulation c: a<br>
number of important molecules such as MHC class II, B7, CD40, ICAM-1 and<br>
5	IL2-Ra. For T cells, addition of CT or LT holotoxins or recombinant 3 subunits<br><br><br><br>
is a coding region for a modified, mature A subunit peptide obtained or derived<br>
from an ADP-ribosylating exotoxin, and (b) the second nucleic acid sequence is a<br>
coding region for a mature B subunit peptide obtained or derived from an ADP-<br>
ribosylating exotoxin. The first nucleic acid sequence contains a coding region<br>
5	that provides for a "modified" A subunit peptide in that the said coding  region<br>
has been genetically altered so as to delete a four amino acid residue C-termnai KDEL or RDZL motif normally found in the encoded subumil peotide.<br>
In still a further embodiment, a composition is provided which includes<br><br><br><br>
aspects of the invention, one or both of the toxin subunit peptide coding regions<br>
can be further genetically modified to detoxify rhe subunit peptide(s) encoded<br>
thereby. For example, genetically altered toxin mutants which have disrupted<br>
A\DP-ribcsylat:ng acnviry, tripsin cleavage site mutations, or disrapted birding<br>
5	activity are known in the art. See, e.g., Burnetts at al. (1994) 'Recombinant<br>

prime the replication reaction. The product of the first round of replication is<br>
itself a template for subsequent replication, thus repeated successive cycles of<br>
replication result in geometric amplification of the DNA fragment delimited by<br>
the primer pair used,<br>
5	Once the relevant sequences for the ADP-ribosylating exotoxin subunits<br>
of mterest have been obtained, they can be linked together to provide one or mors conuguous nucleic acid molecules using standard cloning or molecular biology techniques. More particularly, after sequence information for the selected toxin subunit combination has been obtained, the coding sequences can be combined<br><br><br>

the genes of the virus but cannot package its own genome due to a deletion of the<br>

In a second study, the above-described DNA vaccine formulations were<br>
adminisiered to eight groups of mice using the PowderJect® XR-1 particle<br>
5	delivery device (PowderJect Vaccines Inc., Madison, UT). Each experimental<br>
group contained 5 animals, and each ammal received two immunizations with the<br><br><br>
combinations of the present adjuvant plasmid vectors to provide vaccine compositions. After immunization, the immunized animals were challenged with HSV-2 virus. and the protective effect of the various vaccine compositions was<br>
determined.<br>

from the HSV-2 genome, for example the genomic region spanning from<br>
approximately nucleotide 114589 to 134980 of the HSV-2 genome, or anEcoRI<br>
fragment that spans nucleotides 110931 to 139697 of the HSV-2 genome. The<br>
sequence of the HSV-2 genome is available form published sources, for example<br>
5	the sequence deposited with GenBank un der Accession Number NC_001798.<br><br><br><br>
In the study, the above-described DNA vaccine fcrmulatains were administered to five different groups of mice using the PowderJect XR-1<br>
15	panicle delivery device (PowderJect Vaccines Inc., Madison, WT). Each<br>
experimental group contained 12 animals, and each animal received two immunizations (single shot applied to the abdomen) with the respective formulation with a four vveelc restmg period beUveen inmiunizaiions. A sixth group of mice was established as a negative (naivej control, and did not receive<br>
20	any vaccinations. 4 mice from each group were sacked 2 weeks arier the second<br>
immunization and used for IFN-y ELISPOT assays (data not shown).<br>
Two v/eeks post second immunization, all remaining mice (8/group) were challenged with 1X10° FPU of HSV-2 virus, strain MS, via intra-nasal insullation. The survival graph depicting the results of the challenge study is<br>
25	depicted in Figure 14. As can be seen, 100% of the naive animals succumbed<br>
within 4 days post challenge. The naive animals are depicted on the graph by the   curve. In addition, 100% of the animals receiving the ICP27 antigen plasn:d vector alone (Formulation #1) died within 7 days post challenge. The animals<br>
receiving Formulation  #1 are depicted on the graph by the curve. In marked<br>
30	contrast, the 25% (2/S) of the anim.als receiving the ICP27 piasnrid adjuvanicd<br>
with the low dose CT (Formulation 3) were protected tcm the viral challenge,<br>
89<br><br>
and 38% (3/8) of the animals receiving the ICP27 adjuvanted with the high dose<br>
CT (Formulation #2) were protected from the viral challenge. The animals<br>
receiving Formulation #3 are depicted on the graph by the (■) curve. The<br>
animals receiving Formulation #2 are depicted on the graph by the (♦) cruve.<br>
5	Finally, both the low dose LT-adjuvanted (Formulation =5) and the high dose LT-<br>
adjuvanted (Formulation #4) ICP27 vaccine provided complete (100%) protection in the immunized animals. The animals receiving Formulation #5 are<br>
depicted on the graph by the  curve. The animals receving Formulation =4<br>
are depicted on the graph by the (O) cur\'e.<br>
