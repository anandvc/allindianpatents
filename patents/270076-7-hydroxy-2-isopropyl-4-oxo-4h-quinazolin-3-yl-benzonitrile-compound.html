A.     For preparing compounds of formula (la), where R, and R2 are as defined above, R3 is as defined for a compound of formula I, R^ is amino and m is 1.<br>
Scheme A<br>
First step:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
General description:<br>
The first step of Scheme A involves the condensation/cyclisation of the amide compound of formula 1 with a substituted aniline compound in the presence of phosphorus trichloride to obtain the 7-nitro substituted quinazolin-4-one compound of formula 2.<br>
Second step:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
General description:<br>
The second step of Scheme A involves the reduction of the 7-nitro substituted quinazolin-4-one compound of formula 2 with glacial acetic acid and iron powder to obtain the 7-amino substituted quinazolin-4-one compound of formula 3.<br>
The corresponding a)ky!amines, amides and carbamates may be prepared by methods described in the literature utilising a compound of formula 3. More particularly, the alkylamines may be prepared by subjecting a compound of formula 3 to reductive alkylatjon utilising an appropriate aldehyde or ketone. Alternatively, a compound of formula 3 may be reacted with a Ci-C6alkyl halide. The amides may be prepared by acylating a compound of<br>
formula 3 with an appropriate acyl chloride. The carbamates may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 3 with an appropriate alkylchloroformate.<br>
B.     For preparing compounds of formula (la), where R! and R2 are as defined above, Rs is as defined for a compound of formula I, R+ is hydroxy and m is 1.<br>
Scheme B<br>
(Figure Remove) <br>
General description:<br>
Scheme B involves the Sandmeyer reaction of the 7-amino substituted quinazolin-4-one compound of formula 3 which was prepared as set forth in Scheme A, with concentrated sulphuric acid and sodium nitrite to obtain the 7-hydroxy substituted quinazolin-4-one compound of formula 4.<br>
The starting compounds in Scheme A are known compounds which are commercially available.<br>
Working up the reaction mixtures according to the above processes and purification of the compounds thus obtained may be carried out in accordance with known procedures.<br>
Acid addition salts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice-versa.<br>
Compounds of formulae (I) and (la) in optically pure form can be obtained from the corresponding racemates according to well-known procedures, e.g., HPLC with chiral matrix. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used.<br>
Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g., mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures, e.g., may be separated into their individual diastereomers by<br>
means of fractionated crystallisation, chromatography, solvent distribution and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula (I) or (la) itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, e.g., by salt formation with an enantiomer-pure chira! acid, or by means of chromatography, e.g., by HPLC, using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>
In any additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected, e.g., by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned below. The protecting groups are then wholly- or partly-removed according to one of the methods described there.<br>
The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e., without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, e.g., under conditions analogous to physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The skilled artisan knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter,<br>
.    The protection of such functional groups by protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described, e.g., in standard reference works, such as J.F.W. McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, London and NY (1973); T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, NY (1981); The Peptides; Volume 3, E. Gross and J. Meienhofer, Eds., Academic Press, London and NY (1981); Methoden der organischen Chemie (Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th Edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1974); H.D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel (1982); and Jochen Lehmann, Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate (Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag., Stuttgart (1974).<br>
Alt process steps described herein can be carried out under known reaction conditions, preferably under those specifically mentioned, in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents, preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able<br>
to dissolve these, in the absence or presence of catalysts, condensing agents or neutralizing agents, e.g., ion exchangers, typically cation exchangers, e.g., in the H* form, depending on the type of reaction and/or reactants at reduced, normal or elevated temperature, e.g., in the range from -100eC to about 190°C, preferably from about-80°C to about 150'C, e.g., at -80"C to 60°C, at room temperature, at -20°C to 40°C or at the boiling point of the solvent used, under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel, where appropriate under pressure, and/or in an inert atmosphere, e.g., under argon or nitrogen.<br>

The even more preferred compounds of the formula I or la are the compounds of the Examples 1 to 29, especially of the Examples 1 to 28.<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to the fact that the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and, where possible, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, have beneficial pharmacological activity and, therefore, are useful as Pharmaceuticals. In particular, the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) exhibit human vanilloid antagonistic activity. More particularly, the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) are active at the TRPVI receptor as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit capsaicin and low pH activation of the TRPVI ion channel as follows:<br>
Chinese Hamster ©vary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells, transfected to express either the human, rat or guinea pig TRPV1 receptor, were grown in Minimal Essential Media (MEM) alpha medium without nucleosides supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 lU/mL penicillin, 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 350-700 ug/mL geneticin. All reagents were supplied by Invitrogen. Cells were grown in T-175 flasks or Costar black, clear-bottomed 96-well view plates and maintained at 37°C in a 90% humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were passaged twice a week at a ratio of 1:10 to 1:20 to maintain steady growth. For experimentation, cells were harvested at approximately 80% confluency and plated onto view plates at 40,000 cells per well in 100 uL media and grown overnight.<br>
Calcium mobilisation assay<br>
On the day of the capsaicin assay, media was aspirated and cells were washed with 100 uL 10 mM W-2-(hydroxyethylpiperazine-A/'-[2-ethane-sulfonic acid] (HEPES) buffered Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated for 40 minutes with 2.3 uM of the ratiometric calcium binding dye fura-2/AM (from Molecular Probes), made<br><br>
up in HEPES buffered HBSS, containing 0.01% pluronic F-127. For the pH assay, HEPES was omitted and the pH of HBSS adjusted to 7.4. After washing twice with 100 ul_ assay buffer, cells were incubated for 10 minutes with 100 uL of test compounds (made up in HBSS, pH 7.4), in duplicate, at concentrations between 0.001 and 30 uM. The plate was then placed in a Molecular Devices Flexstation. The TRPV1 receptor was stimulated by application of either capsaicin or low pH. For testing the effect of compounds for possible antagonism, capsaicin was used at the ECso concentration which was 0.05 uM for the rat TRPV1 receptor, and 0.1 uM for the human and guinea pig. For pH experiments, a low pH buffered solution [60 mM 2-[/V-morpholino] ethane sulfonic acid (MES) in HBSS] was added to the assay wells to give a final pH of 5.5.<br>
For determinations of antagonist IC50 values (concentrations of antagonist that inhibit responses to either pH 5.5 or capsacin by 50%), at least 10 antagonist concentrations were measured in duplicate. The response in the presence of the antagonist was calculated as a percentage of the control response to capsaicin or low pH and was plotted against the concentration of antagonist. The IC5o was estimated by non-linear regression analysis to   . sigmoidal-logistic curves by Activity-Base software (v5.0.10) or Microcal Origin (v7.03). These values were averaged (means and standard error of the mean) for at least three independent experiments.<br>
The compounds of formulae (I) and (la), e.g., the compounds of Examples 1-28, show TRPVI receptor antagonist activity having IC5o values in the range 0.004-30 uM.<br>
In view of the above, the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) are useful as vanilloid receptor blockers, e.g., in the treatment of diseases and conditions in which vanilloid receptor activation plays a role or is implicated. Such conditions include, in particular, pain, e.g., bone and joint pain (osteoarthritis), cancer pain, myofascial pain (muscular injury, fibromyalgia) and perioperative pain (genera! surgery, gynecologic surgery).<br>
The compounds of formulae (I) and (la) are particularly useful In the treatment or prevention of chronic pain, especially inflammatory, e.g., chronic inflammatory pain; inflammatory diseases, e.g., inflammatory airways disease, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or in asthma; cough; urinary incontinence; migraine; visceral disorders, e.g., inflammatory bowel disease; rhinitis; cystitis, e.g. interstitial cystitis; pancreatitis; uveitis; inflammatory skin disorders; and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The compounds of formulae (I) and (la) are thus useful as vanilloid receptor antagonists, e.g., for the treatment of pain of various genesis or aetiology and as anti-inflammatory and/or anti-edemic agents for the treatment of inflammatory reactions, diseases or conditions, as well as for the treatment of allergic responses. Having regard to their analgesic/anti-inflammatory profile, they are useful for the treatment of inflammatory pain, for the treatment of hyperalgesia and, in particular, for the treatment of severe chronic pain. They are, e.g., useful for the treatment of pain, inflammation and/or oedema consequential to trauma, e.g., associated with burns, sprains, fractures or the like, subsequent to surgical intervention, e.g., as post-operative analgesics, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory pain of diverse genesis, e.g., for the treatment of osteo and rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatic disease, teno-synovitis and gout. They are further suitable as analgesics for the treatment of pain associated with, e.g., angina, menstruation or cancer. As anti-inflammatory/anti-oedema agents, they are further useful, e.g., for the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders, e.g., psoriasis and eczema.<br>
As vanilioid receptor blockers, the compounds of formula (I) and (la) are also useful as smooth muscle relaxants, e.g., for the treatment of spasm of the gastrointestinal tract or uterus, e.g., in the therapy of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis or pancreatitis.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and (la) are in particular useful as agents for the therapy of airways hyperreactivity and for the treatment of inflammatory events associated with airways disease, in particular, asthma. In addition, the agents of invention may, e.g., be used for the control, restriction or reversal of airways hyperreactivity in asthma.<br>
Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic and, especially, extrinsic asthma. Thus,- the compounds of formula (I) and (la) are useful for the treatment of allergic asthma, as well as, e.g., exercise induced asthma, occupational asthma, asthma induced following bacterial infection, other non-allergic asthmas and "wheezy-infant syndrome".<br>
Efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g., of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack and by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, e.g., anti-inflammatory, e.g., corticosteroid; or bronchodilator, e.g., p2 adrenergic, therapy.<br>
Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable further include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and, in particular, byssinosis.<br>
Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions for which the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) may be used include adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or GOAD), and bronchitis. The compounds of formulae (I) and (la) may also be used for the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis.<br>
In addition to the foregoing, the compounds of formulae (I) and (la) are also indicated for use in the therapy of septic shock, e.g., as anti-hypovolaemic and/or anti-hypotensive agents; in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease; cerebral oedema; headache; migraine; inflammatory skin disease, such as eczema and psoriasis; inflammatory disorders of the gut, e.g., irritable bowel syndrome; Crohn's disease; ulcerative colitis; and cystitis, e.g., interstitial cystitis, nephritis and uveitis.<br>
The agents of the invention are useful in the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions in which human VR1 activation plays a role or is implicated, and therefore susceptible to treatment by the modulation (preferably antagonism) of VR1 receptors. Such conditions include chronic pain with an inflammatory component such as rheumatoid arthritis; bone and joint pain (osteoarthritis); post-surgical pain; musculo-skeletal pain such as fibromyalgia; myofascial pain syndromes; headache, including migraine, acute or chronic tension headache, cluster headache, temporomandibular pain, and maxillary sinus pain; ear pain; episiotomy pain; burns, and especially primary hyperalgesia associated therewith; deep and visceral pain, such as heart pain, muscle pain, eye pain, orofacial pain, abdominal pain, gynaecological pain, such as dysmenorrhoea, and labour pain; pain associated with the urogenital tract such as cystitis and vulvadynia; inflammatory skin disorders, for example psoriasis and eczema, or itch of non-specific origin; chronic pain associated with nerve injury and/or diseases affecting the nervous system, such as neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, amputations ("phantom limb pain"), nerve entrapment and brachial plexus avulsions, low back pain, sciatica and ankylosing spondylitis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and other chronic nerve injuries; complex regional pain syndromes; central nervous system pain, such<br>
as pain due to spinal cord or brain stem damage, or stroke; gout; scar pain; pain associated with carcinoma, often referred to as cancer pain; respiratory diseases including asthma, aluminosis, anthracosis, inflammatory airways disease, e.g. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; chronic bronchitis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptiiosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis, byssinosis; rhinitis including allergic rhinitis such as seasonal and perennial rhinitis, and non-allergic rhinitis; cough, either idiopathic or associated with respiratory dfseases such as COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis, cancer, or gastrointestinal disturbances such as gastro-oesophageal reflux; autoimmune diseases;, gastrointestinal disorders including but not restricted to irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease. Diseases of the urogenital tract, particularly cystitis; urinary incontinence including bladder detrusor hyper-reflexia and bladder hypersensitivity.<br>
For the above-mentioned indications, the appropriate dosage will of course vary depending upon, e.g., the compound employed, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals are indicated to be obtained at a daily dosage of from about 0.05 to about 150, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg animal body weight, in larger mammals, e.g., humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 0.5 to about 5,000, preferably from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of a compound of formulae (I) and (la), conveniently administered, e.g., in divided doses up to four times a day or in sustained-release form.<br>
The compounds of formulae (1) and (la) can be administered in vivo either alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents effective in the treatment of diseases and conditions in which vanilloid receptor activation plays a role or is implicated including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, such as specific COX-2 inhibitors, e.g., celecoxib and rofecoxib; and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.(NSAIDs), e.g., acetylsalicylic acid and propionic acid derivatives; tricyclic anti-depressants, e.g., Anafranil®, Asendin®, Aventyl®, Elavil®, Endep®, Norfranil®, Norpramin®, Parnelor®, Sinequan®, Surmontil®, Tipramine®, Tofranil®, Vivactil®, Tofranil-PM®; anti-convulsants, e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and gabapentin; bradykinin B1 or B2 antagonists; and GABAB agonists, e.g., L-baclofen.<br>
The agents of the invention can be administered in vivo either alone or in combination with other pharmaceutical agents, e.g. agents effective in the treatment of diseases and conditions in which the human VR1 activation plays a role or is implicated, such as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, including specific COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib, lumiracoxib,<br>
and valdecoxib) or in general nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g. acetylsalicylic acid, propionic acid derivatives), anti-migraine agents such as 5-HTi agonists and CGRP antagonists, trtcyclic antidepressants (e.g. clomipramine, amoxapine, nortripyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, doxepin, trimipramine, protripyline) selective serotonic reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine), selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (e.g. duloxetine), anticonvulsants (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin, oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine), GABAe agonists {e.g. L-baciofen), opioids (e.g. morphine), CBi receptor agonists, bradykinin receptor antagonists, substance P antagonists.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for separate administration of the combination partners and for the administration in a fixed combination, i.e., a single galenical composition comprising at least two combination partners, according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known perse and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals, including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active combination partner alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, especially suitable for enteral or parenterai application.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions contain, e.g., from about 0.1% to about 99.9%, preferably from about 20% to about 60%, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, e.g., those in unit dosage forms, such as tablets including sugar-coated tablets, capsules, suppositories and ampoules. These are prepared in a manner known, per se, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of a combination partner contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
A further aspect of the instant invention involves the "novel" compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (la), in free or salt form and, where possible, in acid addition salt form.<br>
