This invention relates to an oil chamber cleaning machine. More particularly it relates to a oil chamber cleaning machine which sucks contaminated oil from the oil chamber through vacuum pressure along with all sludge, impurities etc. and thus cleans the oil chamber completely.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
After running particular kilometers, engine oil and gear oil of the vehicle is to be replaced with new fresh oil. Presently in all vehicle workshops manual method is being used i.e. by opening the bottom bolt of the oil chamber thereby draining out the contaminated oil but the chamber does not get empty completely as some quantity of contaminated oil along with sludge, impurities etc. is left inside the oil chambers which cannot be taken out by it. When fresh oil is put in the chamber, it gets mixed up with these impurities thereby reduce the efficiency of the fresh oil from day one. Furthermore the person cleaning is subjected to a high contamination which brings along proven health risk.<br>
Deficiencies of the present oil change manual method:<br>
1.	As the oil chamber still contains small quantity of the contaminated oil after the cleaning, efficiency of the fresh oil filled is reduces and ultimately it effects the efficiency of the vehicle.<br>
2.	Life of the engine reduces.<br>
3.	As impurities are still inside the chamber, engine emits more smoke which leads to air pollution.<br>
4.	Mileage of the vehicle reduces.<br>
5.	Pick up of the vehicle reduces.<br>
6.	It effects on the smooth riding of the vehicle.<br>
7.	Present process of oil changing is time consuming.<br>

B1, B2, B3 and B4: Glass containers<br>
Referring to figures 1 to 4, the oil chamber cleaning machine (1) in accordance with the present invention comprises a compressor (2) for creating the vacuum. Compressor (2) is housed inside a special casing (3). The compressor (2) consists of a vacuum pipe (4). One end of vacuum pipe (4) is connected to compressor (2) &amp; other end is connected to "T" type connector (5). At least two glass containers (B1, B2, B3 &amp; B4) are provided outside for collecting the contaminated oil from the oil chamber. These glass containers (B1, B2, B3 &amp; B4) are connected to each other in series fashion through pipe (20). In figure \ and 2, only two glass containers (B1, B2) are shown. An unloading plug (6) is provided at the bottom of each glass container to drain the collected oil. First glass container (B1) is fitted with a football kind of valve (17) for avoiding the entry of used oil inside the compressor casing. The ball sticks to the pipe line end attached to air filter and does not allow used oil to enter inside the compressor, A filter (7) is provided for restricting unwanted particles from entering inside the compressor (2). One end of the filter (7) is connected to first glass container (B1) in the set of the series connected containers (B1, B2, B3 and B4) and other end is connected to one end of the "T" type connector (5). A vacuum release valve (10) is provided for controlling the release of the vacuum pressure created by the compressor (2). This vacuum valve (10) has two openings. At one opening a pipe (20) is connected whose other end is connected to the last glass (B2/B4) in the set of the series connected containers (B1, B2, B3 and B4). To other opening of the vacuum valve (10), suction pipe (11) is attached which is placed at the drainage point of the oil chamber for sucking the oil in the glass containers. A vacuum meter (8) is connected to the compressor (2) through "T" type connector (5) for indicating the vacuum pressure created by the compressor (2). The whole machine (1) is powered by the power supply unit (11). The power supply unit (11) provides the supply to the whole machine (1) and also it protects the machine from voltage fluctuations. All these accessories i.e. compressor (2), vacuum meter (8), "T" type connector (5), vacuum pipe (4) all are placed inside the housing (9). Handle (18) is provided on the housing (9) for easy shifting of the machine (1). The glass containers (B1, B2, B3 and B4) are connected to the housing from outside using the clamping unit (19). Base rubbers (22) are fitted at the bottom of the machine housing (9) to prevent it from direct contact with the ground.<br>
The power supply unit (11) of the oil chamber cleaning machine (1) consists of main power supply unit (12) for providing power to the machine. It also consists of on-off switch (13) to input the power supply to the machine. An ampere meter (14) is provided for indicating power supply consumed by the machine during application. An overload device (15) along with relay (16) is connected to the compressor (2) for protecting compressor from over heating &amp; voltage fluctuation.<br>
Now referring to figure 3, the vacuum supply unit of the oil chamber cleaning machine is shown. As shown in figure, compressor (2) is connected to vacuum meter (8) and filter (7) through "T" type filter (5). Filter (7) is connected to container (B1). Four containers (B1, B2, B3 and B4) are connected in series fashion i.e. Container B1 is connected to<br><br><br>
container (B2), container (B2) is connected to container (B3) and Container (B3) is connected to container (B4). Container (B4) is connected to vacuum release valve (10). It means filter (7), containers (B1, B2, B3 and B4) and vacuum release valve (10) are connected in series fashion. When the compressor (2) starts and produces the vacuum, first vacuum created goes to vacuum pipe (4) and to air filter (7) and to the vacuum meter (8) through the "T" type connector (5). The vacuum goes to glass container (B1), then to container (B2), then to container (B3) and then to container (B4). Then vacuum goes to vacuum release valve (10). After that when vacuum release valve (10) is released, vacuum goes to oil chamber through the suction pipe (11). Because of this vacuum, all impurities, sludge and used oil are sucked in the glass container (B4). When the glass container (B4) is filled, the used oil automatically gets filled in the glass container (B3), the container (B2) and then to container (B1). When these containers are filled the used oil is taken out by opening a unloading plug (6) provided at the bottom of the containers.<br>
Now referring to figure 4, the power supply unit (11) of the oil chamber cleaning machine is shown. As shown in figure, power supply unit consists of: Main power supply unit for providing power to the machine; On-off switch to input the power supply to the machine; Ampere meter for indicating power supply consumed by the machine during application; Overload device along with relay connected to the compressor for Protecting compressor from over noaftincf i&amp; voltage fluctuations. The main power supply from the electrical point, first goes to power in MCB switch (12), then to ON/OFF switch (13). The switch (13) is placed on the front top of the machine. From there it travels to Ampere meter (14) and from Ampere meter (14) it goes to condenser (21) Relay (16) and Compressor (2)<br>
Working of oil chamber cleaning machine of the present invention:<br>
First the release valve is closed before suctioning of the contaminated oil from the oil chamber. Then switch on the power supply. Then by means of compressor vacuum pressure is generated till its level reach to maximum. Then the suction pipe is placed at the drainage point of the oil chamber. Then the release valve is opened till the vacuum reach to zero level. Then this whole process is repeated till the oil is completely sucked.<br>
Advantages of the oil chamber cleaning machine of the present invention:<br>
1.	It provides quick &amp; thorough cleaning of oil chamber.<br>
2.	As all the contaminated oil is removed by the machine, efficiency of the fresh oil filled increases and ultimately it improves the performance of the vehicle.<br>
3.	Life of the engine increases.<br>
4.	As impurities are completely removed from the chamber, engine emits less smoke which does not create so much air pollution.<br>
5.	Mileage of the vehicle increases.<br>
6.	Pick up of the vehicle increases.<br>
7.	It smoothes riding of the vehicle.<br>
