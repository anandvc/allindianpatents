				<td>ANTIPLAQUE BREATH FRESHENING CONSUMABLE FILM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an orally consumable film for delivering antibacterial agents to<br>
the oral cavity and in particular a consumable film having antiplaque and breath freshening<br>
properties enhanced by the presence of an antibacterial ester compound incorporated in the<br>
film.<br>
2. The Prior Art<br>
Halitosis, the technical term for breath malodor, is an undesirable condition. Breath malodor<br>
results when proteins, particles from food, and saliva debris are decomposed by mouth<br>
bacteria. The tongue, with its fissures and large, bumpy surface area, retains considerable<br>
quantities of food and debris that support and house a large bacterial population. Under low<br>
oxygen conditions, the bacteria form malodorous volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) such as<br>
hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptans.<br>
Dental plaque is a soft deposit which forms on teeth and is comprised of an accumulation of<br>
bacterial and bacterial by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or<br>
discontinuity, e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line and the like. Besides being<br>
unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal<br>
disease.<br>
A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard breath malodor<br>
and plaque formation and the oral infections associated therewith. For example, halogenated<br>
hydroxydiphenyl ether compounds such as Triclosan are well known to the art for their<br>
antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions such as toothpastes to counter<br>
breath malodor and plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity.<br>
BrT3 52,420 discloses that the mono-N-higher aliphatic acyl arginine derivative adhere to the<br>
mucosa in the oral cavity and possess an antibacterial activity against oral bacterium such as<br>
Lactobacillus, a main pathogen of dental caries and bacterium belonging to the genus<br>
Staphylococcus, a main pathogen of alveolar pyorrhea.<br>
US 5,874,068 discloses an antiplaque effective mouthrinse containing a NÂ°-acyl acidic amino<br>
acid ester salt, the salt being stabilized by the presence in the mouthrinse of a monohydric<br>
alcohol such as ethanol, as aqueous compositions containing these salts normally undergo<br>
hydrolysis in aqueous environments.<br>
It is known to the art to use consumable water soluble or dispersible films adapted to<br>
disintegrate in the oral cavity which films contain flavoring agents for delivering breath<br>
freshening agents to mask or reduce bacteria caused breath malodor. For example, US<br>
6,419,903 discloses a consumable breath freshening film adapted to dissolve in the mouth of<br>
the user, the film being comprised of a water soluble hydroxyalkylmethyl cellulose, a water<br>
dispersible starch and a flavoring agent.<br>
US 6,177,096 discloses a film composition containing therapeutic and/or breath freshening<br>
agents for use in the oral cavity prepared from a water soluble polymer such as<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and a polyalcohol such as glycerol,<br>
polyethylene glycol.<br>
Although the prior art water soluble consumable films have provided breath freshening<br>
benefits, the art continually seeks to enhance such benefits.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided orally consumable film composition<br>
effective to reduce breath malodor and plaque formation on teeth having incorporated in the<br>
film matrix an antibacterial ester and salts thereof having the formula<br>
NH2<br>
[R2CONH-CH-(CH2)n-NH-C-NH2]+<br>
I<br>
COOR1<br>
where R1 is an alkyl chain of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and R2 is an alkyl chain of 6 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms and X is an anion,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The film of the present invention comprises a consumable water soluble or dispersible forming<br>
polymer containing an antibacterial ester compound namely, a Na-acyl acidic amino acid ester<br>
compound. The film can further comprise water, flavor agents, plasticizing agents,<br>
emulsifying agents, coloring agents, sweeteners and other compatible antibacterial and other<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
Antibacterial Ester<br>
hi the above identified antibacterial ester formula, R2CO may be a natural system mixed fatty<br>
acid residue such as coconut oil fatty acid tallow fatty acid residue and the like, or a mono-fatty<br>
acid residue such as lauroyl, myristyl, stearoyl and the like, the lauroyl group being preferred.<br>
Examples of antibacterial ester salts of the above identified formula include an inorganic acid<br>
salt such as hydrochloride, sulfate or an organic salt such as acetate, tautarate or citrate, the<br>
chloride salt being preferred.<br>
Examples of antibacterial ester compounds preferred in the practice of the present invention<br>
are antibacterial ester compound of the above-identified formula wherein n in the formula<br>
equals 3 as for example, Na-cocoyl-L-arginine methyl ester, Na-cocoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester,<br>
NQ-cocoyl-L-arginine propyl ester, Na stearoyl-L-arginine methyl ester, Na steoryl-L-arginine<br>
ethyl ester hydrochloride. The term "cocoyl" is an abbreviation for coconut oil fatty acid<br>
residue, and chloride salts of these compounds, these ester compounds hereinafter being<br>
referred to as arginine derivative compounds. A preferred arginine derivative compound is the<br>
hydrochloride salt of ethyl lauroyl arginine.<br>
The antibacterial ester of the present invention is present in the film compositions of the<br>
present invention at a concentration of about 0.05 to about 25% by weight and preferably about<br>
0.075 to about 20% by weight.<br>
Arginine derivative compounds and their salts in particular show excellent inhibitory effect<br>
against microorganisms which possess relatively strong resistance to bacterium such as<br>
S.aureus, S.mutans, F.nucleatum which are involved in plaque formation on teeth. As will<br>
hereinafter be demonstrated, the plaque inhibitory effect of the film composition of the present<br>
invention is comparable to that of Triclosan, the only antibacterial agent approved by the U.S.<br>
Federal Drug Administration for use in oral care formulations.<br>

cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium alginate, alginate esters, guar<br>
gum, xanthan gum, gelatin, polyethylene oxide, polyethylene glycol, carrageenan, pullulan,<br>
locust bean gum as well as water dispersible polymers such as polyacrylates, carboxyvinyl<br>
copolymers, methyl methacrylate copolymers and polyacrylic acid. A low viscosity<br>
hydropropylmethyl cellulose polymer (HPMC) having a viscosity in the range of about 1 to<br>
about 40 millipascal seconds (mPa.s) as determined as a 2% by weight aqueous solution of the<br>
HPMC at 20 Â°C using a Ubbelohde tube viscometer is a preferred film matrix material as is<br>
disclosed in US 6,419,903, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference..<br>
Preferably the HPMC has a viscosity of about 3 to about 20 mPa-s at 20Â°C such HMPC is<br>
available commercially from the Dow Chemical Company under the trade designation<br>
Methocel E5 Premium LV. Methocel E5 Premium LV is a USP grade, low viscosity HPMC<br>
having 29.1% methoxyl groups and 9% hydroxyproxyl group substitution. It is white or offwhite<br>
free flowing dry powder. As a 2 weight % solution in water as measured with Ubbelohde<br>
tube viscometer it has a viscosity of 5.1 to mPa-s at 20Â°C.<br>
4<br>
The%droxyalkyl methyl cellulose is incorporated in the film composition in amounts ranging<br>
from about 10 to about 60% by weight and preferably about 15 to about 40% by weight.<br>
Cold water dispersible, swellable, physically modified and pregelatinized starches are<br>
particularly useful as texture modifier to increase the stiffness of the hydroxyalkyl methyl<br>
cellulose polymer films of the present invention. To prepare such starch products, the granular<br>
starch is cooked in the presence of water and possibly an organic solvent at a temperature not<br>
higher than 10Â°C higher than the gelatinization temperature. The obtained starch is then dried.<br>
Pregelatinized corn starch is available commercially. A preferred starch is available under the<br>
trade designation Cerestar Polar Tex-Instant 12640 from the Cerestar Company. This Cerestar<br>
starch is a pregelaterized, stabilized and crosslinked waxy maize starch. It is readily dispersible<br>
and swellable in cold water. In its dry form, it is a white free flowing powder with an average<br>
particle size no greater than 180 micrometers and 85% of the particles are smaller than 75<br>
micrometers. It has a bulk density of 441bs/ft3.<br>
The pregelatinized starch may be incorporated in the film matrix of the present invention in an<br>
amount ranging from about 5 to about 50% by weight and preferably about 10 to about 35% by<br>
weight.<br>
Emuisifiers<br>

dispersion of the ingredients. Examples of suitable emulsifiers include condensation products<br>
of ethylene oxide with fatty acids, fatty alcohols, polyhyrric alcohols (e.g., sorbitan<br>
monostearate, sorbitan oleate), alkyl phenols (e.g., Tergitol) and polypropyleneoxide or<br>
polyoxybutylene (e.g., Pluronics); amine oxides such as dimethyl cocamine oxide, dimethyl<br>
lauryl amine oxide and cocoalkyldimethyl amine oxide polysorbates such as Tween 20, Tween<br>
40 and Tween 80 (Hercules), glyceryl esters of fatty acid (e.g., Arlacel 186), natural and<br>
synthetic lipids such as lecithin. The emulsifying agent is incorporated in the film matrix<br>
composition of the present invention at a concentration of about 0.01 to about 10% by weight<br>
and preferably about 0.1 to 5.0% by weight.<br>
Flavor Agents<br>
Flavor agents that can be used to prepare the film of the present invention include those known<br>
to the art, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavor agents may be chosen from<br>
synthetic flavor oils and flavoring aromatics, and/or oils, oleo resins and extracts derived from<br>
plants, leaves, flowers, fruits and so forth, and combinations thereof. Representative flavor oils<br>
include: spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf<br>
oil, oil of nutmeg, oil of sage, and oil of bitter almonds. These flavor agents can be used<br>
individually or in admixture. Commonly used flavor include mints such as peppermint,<br>
artificial vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit flavors, whether employed<br>
individually or in admixture. The amount of flavoring agent employed is normally a matter of<br>
preference subject to such factors as flavor type, individual flavor, and strength desired.<br>
Generally the flavor agent is incorporated in the film of the present invention in an amount<br>
ranging from about 0.1 to about 35% by weight and preferably about 3 to about 25% by<br>
weight.<br>
Sweeteners useful in the practice of the present invention include both natural and artificial<br>
sweeteners. Suitable sweetener include water soluble sweetening agents such as<br>
monosaccharides, disaccharides and plysaccharides such as xylose, ribose, glucose (dextrose),<br>
mannose, glatose, fructose (levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, water soluble artificial<br>
sweeteners such as the soluble saccharin salts, i.e., sodium or calcium saccharin salts,<br>
cyclamate salts dipeptide based sweeteners, such a L-aspartic acid derived sweeteners, such as<br>
L-aspartyl-L-phenylalaine methyl ester (aspartame) and sucralose.<br>
In general, the effective amount of sweetener is utilized to provide the level of sweetness<br>
desired for a particular composition, will vary with the sweetener selected. This amount will<br>
normally be about 0.01 % to about 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
Plasticizers<br>

the film matrix of the present invention, such antibacterial agents including Triclosan,<br>
cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidene, natural herbs such as Magnolia, metal salts such as<br>
stannous chloride, stannous citrate and stannous gluconate and zinc salts such as zinc chloride,<br>
zinc citrate and zinc gluconate, and copper salts such as copper gluconate.<br>
Film Manufacture<br>
In preparing the film composition according to the present invention, a water soluble or water<br>
dispersible film forming agent such as hydroxyalkylmethyl cellulose is dissolved in a<br>
compatible solvent such as water heated to about 60Â°C to about 95 Â°C to form a film forming<br>
composition. Thereafter, there is optionally added in the sequence, a second film forming agent<br>
such as starch, sweetener, surfactant, flavor, antibacterial ester and other antiplaque agents to<br>
prepare a film ingredient slurry.<br>
The slurry is cast on a releasable carrier and dried. The carrier material must have a surface<br>
tension which allows the film solution to spread evenly across the intended carrier -width<br>
without soaking to form a destructive bond between the film and the carrier substrate.<br>
Examples of suitable carrier materials include glass, stainless steel, Teflon and polyethylene<br>
impregnated paper. Drying of the film may be carried out at elevated temperatures in a<br>
convection oven or by transversing through a zoned dryer at approximately 10-100 inches/min<br>
at temperatures ranging for example from, 70Â°C to 120Â°C, using a drying oven, drying<br>
terminal, vacuum drier, or any other suitable drying equipment for residence times which do<br>
not adversely effect the ingredients of which the film is composed.<br>
The film once formed is segmented into dosage units by die-cutting or slitting-and-die cutting.<br>
The segmented film has a strip width and length corresponding to about the size of a postage<br>
stamp, generally about 12 to about 30 millimeter in width and about 20 to about 50 millimeters<br>
in length. The film has a thickness ranging from about 15 to about 80 micrometers, and<br>
preferably about 40 to 60 micrometers.<br>
The following examples further describe and demonstrate preferred embodiments within the<br>
scope of the present invention. The examples are given solely for illustration, and are not to be<br>
construed as limitation of this invention as many variations thereof are possible without<br>
departing from its spirit and scope.<br>
Exflfaflle<br>
A series of films containing varying amounts of the arginine derivative compound the<br>
hydrochloride salt of ethyl lauroyl arginine designated Compositions A, B and C were prepared<br>
by using the ingredients listed in Table I below. In preparing the film, the hydroxy<br>
propylmethylcellulose polymer ingredient (Methocel E5LV) and carrageenan was added at a<br>
temperature of 70Â°C to 90Â°C, to half the amount of total deionized water used, and the solution<br>
stirred for 20 minutes at a slow speed using a IKA Labortechnik Model RW20DZMixer. The<br>
remaining amount of water maintained at room temperature (21Â°C) was then added and the<br>
mixing continued for 40 minutes. To this solution was added the com starch ingredient<br>
(Cerestar Polar Tex Instant 12640) and the mixture stirred for an additional 20 minutes until<br>
the starch was completely dispersed and a homogeneous mixture was formed. To this mixture<br>
was added sucralose and mixed for 10 minutes after which the emulsifier Tween 80 was added<br>
and mixed for an additional 5 minutes. Thereafter, flavor was thoroughly mixed for an<br>
additional 30 minutes to form a slurry emulsion to which as a final step the hydrochloride salt<br>
of ethyl lauroyl arginine HC1 (ELAH) dispersed in canola oil was slowly added until evenly<br>
dispersed in the film ingredient slurry. The emulsion was then cast on a polyethylene coated<br>
paper substrate and dried in a convection oven at 110Â°C to form a solid thin (30-60 um thick)<br>
film.<br>
For^Bposes of comparison, the procedure of Example I was repeated to prepare a film<br>
composition designated Composition D with the exception that no ethyl lauroyl arginine HC1<br>
was incorporated in the film composition.<br>
The antiplaque activity of Compositions A, B, C and D was assessed using a flow cell model of<br>
the type disclosed in the Journal of Dental Research, vol. 73(11), pp. 1748-1755 (1994) using<br>
human saliva as the bacterial source and single crystal germanium prisms as the oral surface<br>
model. After pretreatment of these surfaces with a precisely cut strip (10mm x 20mm), they<br>
were rinsed with artificial saliva (1 part porcine mucin 25 g/L, and 1 part saliva buffer<br>
solution) prior to exposure to bacteria, and exposed to treatment in the flow cell. The plaque<br>
index of the deposits on the prisms was determined by infrared spectrophotometry.<br>
Compositions A, B and C were assessed for overall plaque inhibition versus the comparative<br>
Composition D which did not contain an antibacterial agent which was simultaneously run in<br>
the system. The lower the Plaque Index the more effective the antiplaque agent. The results<br>
recorded in Table II below show a 30-40% reduction in plaque effected by Film Compositions<br>
A, B and C when compared to Comparative Film Composition D.<br>
Composition F contained 5% by weight (dry film) ELAH and 1.5% by weight (dry film) zinc<br>
gluconate. For purposes of comparison, film Composition G prepared in the same manner as<br>
Film A but which contained no ELAH and Film Composition H, a commercially available<br>
breath freshening film were tested for antiplaque efficacy in the artificial mouth test model.<br>
The tests were run in parallel under identical conditions wherein 4 hydroxyapatitie discs (HAP)<br>
disks were coated with pellicle for two hours followed by additional 2 hours of bacteria<br>
attachment. The disks were mounted in a flow cell and a lOmL solution of film (containing<br>
150 mg film) were then passed over the surface of the disks for 1-2 minutes; water \vas passed<br>
over the disks for 10 minutes to wash. The flow cell was then connected to the artificial mouth<br>
chemostat circulator and incubated for 8-12 hours. The procedure was repeated 4 times, and<br>
thereafter the HAP disks were dismounted and bacteria on the disks were detached. The<br>
bacteria were quantified by optical density readings. The results of this test procedure are<br>
recorded in Table III below.<br>
The results recorded in Table III show that antibacterial films of the present invention (Films<br>
E, F) effect a significant reduction in antiplaque formation when compared to films G, H that<br>
did not contain the arginine derivative compound.<br>
Example III<br>
The procedure of Example II was repeated in which a series of film compositions designated J,<br>
K were prepared following the procedure of Example I in which Composition E contained 5%<br>
by weight (dry film) EL AH, Composition L contained 5% by weight (dry film) ELAH and<br>
1.5% by weight (dry film) zinc gluconate. For purposes of comparison, Composition M<br>
contained 5% by weight (dry film) Triclosan, but no ELAH and Composition H was a placebo<br>
containing no ELAH or antibacterial ester compound.<br>
12<br>
The~sfotiplaque efficacy of the films was evaluated following the artificial mouth model<br>
described in Example II, The results of these tests are recorded in Table IV below.<br>
(Table Removed)  The results recorded in Table IV indicate that ELAH is at least effective as Triclosan in<br>
reducing plaque formation when delivered to the oral cavity from a consumable film and that a<br>
combination of ELAH and a metal salt such as zinc gluconate provides antiplaque efficacy<br>
superior to Triclosan.<br>
Example IV<br>
A series of film compositions designated Compositions N, P, Q were prepared following the<br>
procedure of Example I, in which Composition N contained 0.50 by weight ELAH,<br>
Composition P contained 2.5% ELAH and Composition Q contained 5% by weight ELAH.<br>
For purposes of comparison film Composition R was also prepared following the procedure of<br>
Example I except that no ELAH was incorporated in the film composition.<br>
Film Compositions N, P, Q and R were evaluated for breath freshening efficacy by an in-vitro<br>
volatile sulfur compound (VSC) reduction assay. In this assay a known amount of film is<br>
dissolved in 3.0 milliliters (ml) of saliva in a glass vial. After incubation at 37Â°C overnight,<br>
the headspace of the solution is sampled and analyzed for the VSC. The VSC assay results are<br>
The VSC assay results recorded in Table V demonstrate the increase in VSC reduction as the<br>
concentration of the antibacterial ester ELAH in the film matrix is increased.<br>
