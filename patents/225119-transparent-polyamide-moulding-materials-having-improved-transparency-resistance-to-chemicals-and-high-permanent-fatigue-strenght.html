TRANSPARENT POLYAMIDE MOULDING<br>
MATERIALS	HAVING	IMPROVED<br>
TRANSPARENCY, RESISTANCE TO CHEMICALS AND HIGH PERMANENT FATIGUE STRENGHT;<br>
EMS-CHEMIE AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS REICHENAUERSTRASSE, CH-7013 DOMAT / EMS, SWITZERLAND;<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to transparent polyamide moulding materials. More specifically, the present invention relates to polyamide moulding materials having an optimum transparency and optimum chemical resistance as well as high permanent     fatigue strength.<br>
Two polymer types are known in the field of transparent polyamides having a high light transmission, high permanent fatigue strength and excellent chemical resistance,<br>
Microcrystalline, transparent polyamide moulding materials having excellent chemical resistance, especially to alcohols, which are produced from PACM having 35 - 60 mole-% of the bis-(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane trans,trans-isomer, 65-40 mole-% of other diamines and dodecanedioic acid are known by DE 43 10 970. A disadvantage is the low glass transition temperature (Tg) being 140 °C and the low stiffness. Due to the microcrystalline phases, the transparency does not achieve the  optimum. The permanent fatigue strength for these polyamide types for defined initial bending stresses shows low numbers of cycles to break in fatigue test after Wohler.<br>
Amorphous, transparent polyamide moulding materials which have high chemical and thermal resistances and an excellent permanent fatigue strength to fatigue test after Wohler and which are constituted from MACM (bis-(4-amino-3-methyl-cyclohexyl)-methane)"and dodecanedioic acid are known by EP-A-0 725 101. With regard to the microcrystalline, transparent polyamides, the resistance to alcohols is lower. The transparency is comparable to the PACM 12 types, but is not yet optimum.<br>
DE 196 42 885 C2 describes amorphous, transparent polyamide moulding materials containing at least a second homopolyamide which show an excellent permanent fatigue strength besides the properties described in EP-A-0 725 101 and<br><br>
which are suitable for producing moulded parts for electro-optical applications such as lenses for sunglasses and opticals waveguides.<br>
At mechanical loading of the surfaces, transparent polyamides have a high abrasion resistance and a good scratch resistance which can be further improved by a coating with hard lacquer.<br>
Transparent polyamides are advanced polymers which are used especially in the field of aggressive media and in the field of high pressure load and high permanent fatigue strength. Simultaneously, transparent polyamides have high glass transition temperatures (Tg) and achieve high thermal resistance.<br>
For example, aggressive media at high temperatures are present in dish¬washers or media-conducting systems to which transparent mass-produced materials such as PS (polystyrene), PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)), PET (polyethylene terephthalate), PVC (polyvinyl chloride)) or PC (polycarbonate) do not resist. Application examples are baby bottles, bottles for earbonating, dinner-service and cutlery handles. For example, resistance to chemicals in connection with thermal resistance and permanent fatigue strength are required for viewing glasses in the field of heating technics and service stations having direct fuel or oil contact, filter cups for drinking water treatment and media filtration, flowmeter for gases or liquid media, lamp cases, reflectors for auto lamps and sensors. The importance of transparent polyamides for external use increases because high weathering resistances are achieved by a combination of cycloaliphatic diamines having long-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids, which can be adjusted optimumly by the tertiary butylphenol class and HALS types stabilizers.<br>
Further, lacquering processes require chemical resistance to avoid stress cracks to the solvents, but require simultaneously an activability of the surfaces to achieve an optimum lacquer adhesion. Numerous lacquers such as hard lacquers for increasing the scratch resistance require hardening temperatures up to 130°C.<br>
High permanent fatigue strength in combination with a very good thermal and chemical resistance are required also in the field of spectacles and safety spectacles besides the engine construction and the medicinal technics.<br>
Spectacle glasses for sunglasses and correction spectacles can be produced due to the favorable optical properties such as refractive index and Abbe coefficient and<br><br>
transparency. Also, lenses for technical devices, lights or signal lamps, opto-electronic couplers or LEDs can be produced. These applications require the optical properties as well as an improved transparency and clarity as well as simultaneously a high temperature stability with a very low discoloration of the materials. The combination of suitable properties for spectacle frames and spectacle lenses of amorphous polyamides having an excellent resistance to chemicals and stress cracks allows new design forms for spectacles having bores for positioning screws directly in the spectacle glass, which leads to cracks and breaks for traditionally used materials such as glass, PC or PMMA.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an advantage of the present invention to provide polyamide-based<br>
moulding materials having an optimum transparency and optimum chemical resistance<br>
as well as a high permanent fatigue strength and to provide moulded articles being<br>

Further, the present invention provides methods for producing the moulding materials according to the invention and methods for producing and further treating moulded articles from the moulding materials according to the invention. Especially, the present invention relates to spectacles and spectacle glasses or eyeglasses, respectively, which are obtainable from the polyamide moulding materials according to the invention.<br><br>
The term PACM used in this application represents the ISO-name bis-(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-methane which is commercially available under the commercial name 4,4'-diaminodicyclohexylmethane as dicycane type (CAS no. 1761-71-3).

It is intended in the spirit of the present invention that the terms PACM and MACM, respectively, include all trivial names, commercial names or other names being common to those skilled in the art and corresponding to the chemical structures 10    of the above compounds.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention are described in, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description of the Invention and the figures.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
15	According  to   the  invention  the  advantages   are  achieved  by  providing<br>
transparent polyamide moulding materials being characterized in that the polyamides have a melting enthalpy between 0 and 12 J/g and the polyamides are constituted of<br>
A.	100 mole-% of a diamine mixture having 10-70 mole-% of PACM [bis-<br>
(4-amino-cyclohexyl)-methane] with less than 50 wt.-% of trans,trans-<br>
20	isomer   and   90-30   mole-%   of   MACM   [bis-(4-amino-3-methyl-<br>
cyclohexyl)-methane], wherein, optionally, 0-10 mole-% can be replaced by other aliphatic diamines having 6 to 12 C atoms, cycloaliphatic, alkyl-substituted cycloaliphatic, branched aliphatic diamines or multiamines having 3 to 12 amino groups or mixtures<br>
25	thereof, and<br>
B.	100 mole-% of long-chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having 8 to 14 C<br>
atoms or mixtures of these dicarboxylic acids, wherein 0-10 mole-%<br>
can be replaced by other aromatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids<br>
having 8 to 16 C atoms, which are especially selected from the group<br>
30	consisting        of        isophthalic        acid,        terephthalic        acid,<br>
naphthalenedicarboxylic    acid,    cyclohexanedicarboxylic    acid    or<br><br>
mixtures thereof, and wherein, optionally, 0-10 mole-% of the other<br>
long-chain aliphatic diamines and 0-10 mole-% of the other long-chain<br>
aliphatic dicarboxylic acids can be added as 0-20 mole-% of co-<br>
aminocarboxylic acids having 6 to 12 C atoms or lactams having 6 to<br>
5	12 C atoms.<br>
The special advantage of the polyamide moulding material according to the invention is that the used diamine mixture which is in the range of 30-90% MACM and preferably in the range of 30-70 % MACM shows an optimum transparency and minimum discoloration as well as maximum elongation at break. Simultaneously,<br>
10 notched-impact strength and chemical resistance are on a high level. The chemical resistance is adjusted in such a way that moulded articles which are produced from the polyamide moulding materials according to the invention can be treated with usual after-treatment technics, e. g. lacquering, printing, coating, vapor-depositing etc. Excellent values are obtained for a main property of the transparent polyamides, the<br>
15 permanent fatigue strength, which is required, for example, in drinking water systems, where spontaneous pressure changes occur frequently during opening and closing the cocks. The permanent fatigue strength which is measured in form of number of cycles to break in fatigue test after Wohler achieves in moulded articles which are produced from polyamide moulding materials according to the invention high values compared<br>
20 to other polyamides and a multiple of the achievable values such as for moulded articles made of polycarbonate, polystyrene, SAN or poly(methyl methacrylate).<br>
Transparent polyamides which are produced from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or alkyl-substituted aliphatic or cycloaliphatic monomers on optimumly adjusted large-scale plants (5-10 to) show due to a lack of aromatic absorption with 92% at 560 nm in<br>
25 the moulded article having a wall thickness of 2 mm a higher light transmission in the visible and near-infrared range as, for example, polystyrene (PS) or polycarbonate (PC) with 89% similar to the poly(methyl methacrylates) (PMMA) with 92%. The light transmission has a decisive importance in the high-quality transparent applications and is increased to maximum values by coating the surfaces with suitable<br>
30    protecting lacquers.<br>
The optimum resistance to formation of stress cracks in, for example isopropanol, is obtained in the range of 45-0 mole-% of MACM and 65-100 mole-% of<br><br>
PACM.  In this range, crystalline phases are present which do not  impair the transparency and have melting enthalpies between 8 and 25 J/g.<br>
The stress at break and elongation at break of the polyamide moulding materials according to the invention have an optimum in the range of 30-90 mole-% of 5    MACM and 70-10 mole-% of PACM. Simultaneously, moulded articles having a high notched-impact strength and high permanent fatigue strength are obtained.<br>
A  possible  reason  for the  advantageous  transparency  behaviour  of the composition according to the invention is the low crystallinity in a defined range of the melting enthalpy of from 0 to 12 J/g and the reduction of the alky 1-substituted 10    diamines. The transparency decreases for a melting enthalpy above 12 J/g.<br>
With regard to pure MACM12 and PACM12 polyamide types which are<br>
produced on pilot autoclaves, the transparency increases from 80 to 85 % at 540 nm, as<br>
measured on plates made of unpolished moulds having a thickness of 3 mm, for a<br>
composition of the diamines PACM/MACM of 60/40 mole-%. As experience shows,<br>
15     the light transmission is higher for plates made of polished moulds.<br>
Simultaneously, lower discolorations are measured according to ASTM D1925 on plates having a thickness of 3 mm for the range of from 30 to 40 mole-% of MACM despite constant production conditions.<br>
Also, the stress at break and elongation at break show an unexpected maximum 20    of 62 MPa and 160% of elongation in the range of 40-60 mole-% of MACM.<br>
By increasing the PACM amount, the resistance to stress crack to isopropanol<br>
increases of from 15 to 59 MPa of bending stress up to crack formation and achieves<br>
the maximum already in the composition range according to the invention of from 30-<br>
90 mole-% of MACM. Also, a corresponding behaviour is found for hexane and<br>
25     acetone.<br>
The notched-impact strength at 23°C is on a stable level of 11 KJ/m2 for all compositions and shows slight advantages for high PACM amounts with 12 KJ/m2. Especially, these polyamide types are characterized in that the noteched-impact strengths, also when measured at -70°C, do not show a decrease, as it is known for 30 polycarbonate (PC) and polyester. Other transparent materials such as polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) have already 5 to 10 times lower values at 23<br><br>
In a fatigue test at an initial bending stress of approx. 50 MPa, the polyamide moulding materials which are produced on pilot autoclaves achieve a maximum in the composition range of 20-40 mole-% of MACM with number of cycles to break from 0.3 to 0.4 mio. cycles and show highest permanent fatigue strength. When the 5 polyamide moulding materials are produced on production plants having a vessel volume of 1 to 10 cubic meter, the values are higher with 1.0 mio. cycles for MACM12 and 0.6 mio. cycles for PACM12, as experience shows.<br>
