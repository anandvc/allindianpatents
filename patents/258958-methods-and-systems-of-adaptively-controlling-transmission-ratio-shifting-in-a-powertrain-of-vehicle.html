FUEL QUALITY INDICATION FOR ADAPTIVE TRANSMISSION CONTROL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates generally to a powertrain<br>
control system, and more particularly to adaptive shift controls of an<br>
electronically controlled transmission to respond to changes in fuel quality.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] When a driver refuels a motor vehicle, the composition of<br>
fuel (also referred to as fuel quality) in the fuel tank may change significantly<br>
with the addition of new fuel. For example, ethanol and/or gasohol can be<br>
introduced into a fuel tank containing gasoline. Fuel quality can impact the<br>
torque generating capability of an internal combustion engine. Torque output<br>
of the engine may be impacted positively or negatively by as much as seven<br>
percent after a refueling event. Although currently manufactured powertrains<br>
may include adaptive transmission shift controls to improve shift quality, such<br>
controls tend to adapt belatedly to changes in fuel quality.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] The present invention, in one embodiment, is directed to a<br>
method of adaptively controlling transmission ratio shifting in a vehicle<br>
equipped with an electronically controlled transmission. First, a refueling event<br>
is detected. After the detected refueling event, fuel consumption is monitored<br>
over a predetermined period during which a change in composition of fuel to<br>
the engine reaches or approaches a steady state condition. During this<br>
period, the rate of adapting the transmission shift controls is modified to<br>
respond quicker to the errors in ratio change characteristics that may be<br>
induced by differences in torque produced by the engine.<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
2<br>
[0004] In another configuration, the invention is directed to a system<br>
for adaptively controlling the shifting of transmission ratios in an electronically<br>
controlled transmission. A control module controls the transmission to adapt<br>
the shifting to cause at least one actual shift parameter to converge with at<br>
least one predefined shift parameter. First, the control module detects a<br>
refueling event. After the detected refueling event, the control module<br>
monitors fuel consumption by the engine for a period predefined in terms of<br>
fuel consumption. During the period, the control module controls the<br>
transmission to increase a rate of adapting to deviations from the desired<br>
shifting characteristics.<br>
[0005] In another implementation, the invention is directed to a<br>
system for controlling a powertrain in a vehicle having an engine and a<br>
transmission that adaptively shifts transmission ratios in accordance with<br>
learned shift parameters. A control module captures a baseline fuel level in a<br>
fuel tank of the vehicle. The control module recognizes a refueling event after<br>
the baseline fuel level is captured. The control module tracks fuel consumed<br>
after the recognized refueling event until a predetermined amount of fuel is<br>
consumed. During the tracking period, the control module triggers the<br>
transmission shift controls to learn shift parameters responsive at least in part<br>
to the fuel consumed. The learning is performed at a rate faster than a rate of<br>
learning performed before and after the tracking period.<br>
[0006] In yet another implementation, the present invention is<br>
directed to a method of controlling a powertrain in a vehicle. The vehicle has<br>
an engine and a transmission that adaptively shifts transmission ratios in<br>
accordance with learned shift parameters. A baseline fuel level in a fuel tank<br>
of the vehicle is captured. After the capturing step, a refueling event is<br>
recognized. Fuel consumed is tracked after the recognizing event until a<br>
predetermined amount of fuel is consumed. During the tracking period, the<br>
transmission is triggered to learn shift parameters responsive at least in part<br>
to the fuel consumed. The learning is performed at a rate faster than a rate of<br>
learning performed before and after the tracking period.<br><br>

GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
4<br>
[0013] Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle containing adaptive<br>
transmission shift controls in accordance with one embodiment of the present<br>
invention is indicated generally by reference number 20. The vehicle 20 may<br>
be fueled with gasoline and/or ethanol in various percentages. Fuel is<br>
delivered to an engine 22 from a fuel tank 26 through a plurality of fuel<br>
injectors 28. An output of the engine 22 is coupled by a torque converter 30, a<br>
transmission 32, a driveshaft 34 and a differential 36 to driven wheels (not<br>
shown). The transmission 32 transmits power to the differential 36 in<br>
accordance with a plurality of transmission ratios. The transmission 32, which<br>
may be, for example, a continuously variable transmission (CVT) or a step-<br>
gear automatic transmission, is controlled by a control module 40. It should be<br>
understood that a control module, for example, a transmission control module<br>
(TCM), could be used alone or in combination with an engine control module<br>
(ECM) in other embodiments to control the transmission 32.<br>
[0014] An electronic throttle controller (ETC) 42 adjusts a throttle<br>
plate 44 that is located adjacent to an inlet of an intake manifold 46 based<br>
upon a position of an accelerator pedal 48 and a throttle control algorithm that<br>
is executed by the control module 40. The throttle 44 adjusts output torque of<br>
the engine 22.<br>
[0015] A fuel sensor 50 senses a level of fuel in the tank 26 and<br>
communicates the fuel level to the control module 40. Air is delivered to the<br>
engine 22 through the intake manifold 46. Vapor from the fuel tank 26 may be<br>
collected and delivered to the intake manifold 46 and burned in engine<br>
cylinders 52. The control module 40 controls operation of fuel injectors 28 and<br>
an ignition system 54. The control module 40 also is connected with an<br>
accelerator pedal sensor 56 that senses a position of the accelerator pedal 48<br>
and sends a signal representative of the accelerator pedal position to the<br>
control module 40. Other sensor inputs collectively indicated by reference<br>
number 60 and used by the control module 40 include an engine speed signal<br>
62, a vehicle speed signal 64, an intake manifold pressure signal 66, a<br>
manifold air temperature signal 76 and a throttle position signal 68. An engine<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
5<br>
torque signal 70 indicates engine load on the transmission 32. Signals 72 and<br>
74 indicate transmission input and output pulley speeds. .<br>
[0016] A catalytic converter 78 receives exhaust from the engine 22<br>
through an exhaust manifold 80. An oxygen sensor 82 senses exhaust in the<br>
manifold 80 and delivers signals to the control module 40 indicative of<br>
whether the exhaust gas is lean or rich. The signal output of the oxygen<br>
sensor 82 is used by the control module 40 as feedback in a closed-loop<br>
manner to regulate fuel delivery to the engine 22 via fuel injectors 28.<br>
[0017] The control module 40 may use the exhaust sensor 82<br>
feedback to drive an actual air-fuel ratio to a desired value, usually around a<br>
stoichiometric value. A plurality of predefined engine operating regions is<br>
referred to by the control module 40 in controlling fuel delivery to the engine<br>
22. Operating regions may be defined, for example, based on speed and/or<br>
load of the engine 22. The control module 40 may perform control functions<br>
that vary dependent on which operating region of the vehicle is currently<br>
active.<br>
[0018] Fuel, air and/or re-circulated exhaust to the engine 22 may<br>
be adjusted, i.e., trimmed, to correct for deviations from a desired air-fuel<br>
ratio. Trim values used to make such corrections may be stored in control<br>
module 40 memory locations corresponding to a plurality of predefined closed<br>
loop air-fuel ratio control cells (also referred to as sub-regions) associated<br>
with the operating regions of the engine 22. Cell values may be used to<br>
provide closed-loop fuel, air and/or re-circulated exhaust control. For example,<br>
long-term multipliers (LTMs) associated with the cells may be used to learn<br>
and provide long-term corrections to fuel commands to the engine 22 in<br>
response to evolving conditions. A short-term integrator (STI) also may be<br>
used to provide short-term fuel trim corrections as known in the art.<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
6<br>
[0019] The transmission 32 may be controlled by the control<br>
module 40 to adaptively control transmission ratio shifting in order to improve<br>
shift quality. After a shift is made, for example, requested by an operator of<br>
the vehicle 20, parameters such as shift delay and shift time may be<br>
periodically compared to parameters predetermined to represent optimal shift<br>
quality. The control module 40 then may cause hydraulic pressure magnitude<br>
and profile adjustments to be made to cause the actual shift parameters to<br>
converge with the predetermined optimal parameters the next time a shift is<br>
made under similar operating conditions, e.g., engine RPM, engine load, and<br>
road load conditions.<br>
[0020] For example, the control module 40 may compare an actual<br>
shift time to a desired shift time to obtain a shift error. The control module 40<br>
uses the shift error to adjust hydraulic pressure to the transmission 32 to<br>
reduce or eliminate shift error in a subsequent shift. Shift errors may be stored<br>
by the control module 40 in a plurality of cells similar to the cells discussed<br>
above with reference to engine fuel trim. The transmission cells are pre-<br>
designated, for example, based on a plurality of torque ranges of the<br>
engine 22.<br>
[0021] In one implementation of the present invention, a refueling<br>
event is detected. After the detected refueling event, fuel consumption is<br>
monitored for a predetermined period during which a possible change in fuel<br>
composition to the engine 22 reaches or approaches a steady state. During<br>
the predetermined period, the rate of adapting transmission shift controls is<br>
modified to respond quicker to errors in ratio change characteristics that may<br>
be induced by differences in torque produced by the engine.<br>
[0022] One implementation of a method of adaptively controlling the<br>
shifting of transmission ratios in the transmission 32 is indicated generally in<br>
Figure 2 by reference number 100. A baseline level of fuel in the tank 26 is<br>
obtained in order to evaluate an increase in fuel level due to a refueling.<br>
Generally, before a baseline level is obtained, at least enough time is allowed<br>
to pass during which a fuel level in the tank 26 can settle after the vehicle 20<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
7<br>
comes to a stop. Such time, however, also is limited to avoid a possibility that<br>
the vehicle operator could add a significant amount of fuel to the tank 26.<br>
[0023] Accordingly, in step 104 it is determined whether the vehicle<br>
20 has stopped. If the vehicle is stopped, it is determined in step 108 whether<br>
the vehicle ignition system 54 is switched off. If yes, then in step 116 it is<br>
determined whether a first predetermined time period has expired. When the<br>
time has expired, in step 120 a baseline fuel level in the fuel tank 26 is<br>
captured. The first time period preferably expires just before the control<br>
module 40 shuts down completely. In one implementation, shutdown of the<br>
control module 40 is delayed long enough, e.g., several seconds, to allow fuel<br>
to settle so that a baseline capture may be made.<br>
[0024] If the operator refuels the vehicle 20 without switching off the<br>
ignition system 54, time is allowed pass before the refuel event is<br>
acknowledged. During such time, a baseline fuel level can be obtained before<br>
evaluating the refuel event. Thus, accuracy of the present implementation can<br>
be preserved, for example, if the vehicle has come to a stop on a non-level<br>
surface. Accordingly, if in step 108 it was determined that the ignition system<br>
54 is on, then in step 124 it is determined whether a second predetermined<br>
time period has expired. When the second period has expired, then in step<br>
128 it is determined whether the ignition system 54 is still switched on. If yes,<br>
then in step 120 a baseline fuel level in the fuel tank 26 is captured. (It should<br>
be noted that the terms "first", "second" and so on, when used in connection<br>
with time or other periods, do not necessarily refer to any chronological order.<br>
It also should be noted, for example that a "first" period may or may not be<br>
equal to a "second" period.)<br>
[0025] In step 132 a refuel event may be detected. It is assumed<br>
that the vehicle 20 is stopped during a refuel event. Accordingly, in step 132 it<br>
is determined whether the vehicle 20 is stopped and whether a fuel level in<br>
the tank 26 is increasing. If yes, then in step 136 a variable representing an<br>
amount of fuel consumed ("fuel-consumed variable") is set to zero. The fuel-<br>
consumed variable preferably is stored in non-volatile memory so that fuel<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
8<br>
consumed may be tracked across ignition cycles. In step 140 it is determined<br>
whether the vehicle 20 is still stopped. If not, then in step 144 it is assumed<br>
that the refuel event is completed. If in step 140 it is determined that the<br>
vehicle 20 is still stopped, it is determined in step 148 whether a third<br>
predetermined time period has passed since the refuel detection, such that it<br>
can be assumed that the fuel level in the tank 26 is no longer increasing. If<br>
yes, then in step 144 it is assumed that the refuel event is completed.<br>
[0026] The fuel-consumed variable is updated as fuel is consumed<br>
by the engine 22. In step 152 it is determined whether fuel added in the<br>
refueling is being "seen" by the engine 22. Such determination is made based<br>
on the fuel-consumed variable as further described below. If the new fuel is<br>
determined to be reaching the engine 22, then in step 156 the control module<br>
40 enters into a state in which it suspends performing convergence of<br>
adaptive transmission shift control as previously learned. Adaptive control<br>
rates are modified in step 160 so that the control module learns the effects (if<br>
any) of a possible fuel quality change due to the refueling. In step 164 the<br>
fuel-consumed variable is used to determine whether a transition from old fuel<br>
to a mixture of old and new fuel is complete. If yes, then in step 168 the<br>
control module returns to a normal adaptive transmission shift controls.<br>
[0027] A graph indicating shift adaptation relative to fuel quality<br>
transition and amounts of fuel consumed in accordance with one<br>
implementation is indicated generally in Figure 3 by reference number 200.<br>
Generally, a mixing and transport delay that typically occurs before a fuel<br>
change reaches the engine 22 can be characterized consistently when<br>
expressed in terms of fuel consumed since detection of a refueling event.<br>
Accordingly, signaling by the control module 40 to the transmission 32 of<br>
onset and completion of a transition between fuel already in the tank 26 ("old<br>
fuel") and a mixture of old and added fuels can be calibrated in the following<br>
manner. Closed-loop fuel control LTMs (long term multipliers) may be frozen,<br>
that is, prevented from performing long-time learning of fuel trim as described<br>
previously. After adding, for example, ten percent ethanol to gasoline fuel in<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
9<br>
the tank 26, the closed-loop fuel control STI (short term integrator) may be<br>
monitored. The added fuel is preferably selected to have a measurable but<br>
minor effect on engine performance. The STI may be used to measure a<br>
transition between old and combined fuels to provide one or more calibration<br>
values. In one implementation in which fuel transitions are modeled based on<br>
mixing of fuel and transport delays in the vehicle fuel system, a plurality of<br>
shift adaptation stages may be calibrated and performed to provide a plurality<br>
of stages of adaptive transmission shift control.<br>
[0028] The foregoing adaptive transmission shift control system can<br>
improve shift quality while the quality of fuel reaching an engine is in<br>
transition. Implementations of the present invention can account for fuel<br>
quality changes that typically occur quickly compared to time periods needed<br>
by current adaptive transmission shift control systems to improve shift quality.<br>
[0029] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the<br>
foregoing description that the broad teachings of the present invention can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this invention has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
invention should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>

during said tracking period, causes the adaptive transmission shift<br>
controls to learn shift parameters responsive at least in part to the fuel<br>
consumed, said learning performed at a rate faster than a rate of learning<br>
performed before and after said tracking period.<br>
14.	The system of claim 13 wherein during said tracking period, said<br>
control module suspends the normal learning performed before said tracking<br>
period.<br><br>
GP-305087-PTE-CD<br>
13<br>
15.	The system of claim 13 wherein after said tracking period, said<br>
control module resumes the normal learning performed before said tracking<br>
period.<br>
16.	The system of claim 13 wherein during said tracking period, said<br>
control module controls the transmission to increase a rate of adapting to<br>
deviations from the desired shifting characteristics.<br>
17.	A method of controlling a powertrain in a vehicle having an<br>
engine and a transmission that adaptively shifts transmission ratios in<br>
accordance with learned shift parameters, said method comprising:<br>
capturing a baseline fuel level in a fuel tank of the vehicle;<br>
recognizing a refueling event after said capturing step;<br>
tracking fuel consumed after said recognizing step until a<br>
predetermined amount of fuel is consumed; and<br>
during said tracking, causing the adaptive transmission shift<br>
controls to learn shift parameters responsive at least in part to the fuel<br>
consumed, said learning performed at a rate faster than a rate of learning<br>
performed before and after said tracking period.<br>
18.	The method of claim 17, further comprising after said tracking<br>
period, adaptive transmission shift controls are returned to the learning<br>
performed before said tracking.<br><br>
A control system and method for adaptively controlling transmission<br>
ratio shifting in an electronically controlled transmission. A refueling event is<br>
detected. After the detected refueling event, fuel consumption is monitored for<br>
a predetermined period during which a change in composition of fuel to the<br>
engine reaches or approaches a steady state. During the period, the rate of<br>
adapting transmission shift controls is modified to respond quicker to the<br>
change in shift characteristics induced by differences in torque produced by<br>
the engine. Implementing this method can improve transmission shift quality<br>
while the quality of fuel reaching an engine is in transition.<br></td>
