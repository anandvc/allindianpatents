				<td>This invention relates to an automatic suction filtering system for textile machines such as roving frame and spinning frame.<br>
Roving frame or spinning frame has plurality of bottom rollers, suction tube and spindles. On spindles  bobbins or spinning tubes are mounted. The roving or yam is delivered fix)m the bottom rollers and wound on the bobbins or spinning tubes. The roving or yam that is broken during spinning is sucked at the bottom rollers through suction tubes placed near the bottom rollers. The suction tubes are subjected to a negative pressure through a suction duct. Through the suction tube, the waste fiber material is taken to &amp;e suction duct. The suction duct mines through the complete machine and the waste fiber material is taken to the end of the machine, where a suction filtering system is situated. Here the waste fiber material is separated and evacuated manually or automatically.<br>
In the manual waste evacuation system, the filter is to be cleaned manually which means that it depends on the efficiency of the person involved. Failure to attend to the cleaning leads to frequent choking of suction tubes leading to lapping of bottom rollers with waste fiber material.<br>
At present in the automatic waste evacuation system, there is a rotary filter dam supported on bearings or rollers, which are again mounted on sheet metal walls. Being a rotary filter, it involves wear parts like long length mobbed sealing to prevent waste fiber material entry into the fan motor area. The total system involves high accuracy components like rotary filter, sheet metal walls, longer filter cloth to cover the complete rotary filter and alignment of bearings or rollers. As the rotary filter rotates in between<br><br>
the sheet metal walls, alignment of rotary filter will be a difficult job, which is to be repeated at frequent intervals. This makes the system not user friendly and maintenance of the system is not easy.<br>
The automatic suction filtering system according to the invention facilitates continuous waste evacuation having stationary filter elements with twin chambers. The suction is not interrupted during waste evacuation.<br>
Thus the invention provides an automatic suction filtering system for textile machines such as roving frames and spinning frames said system comprising a first filtering chamber with side walls formed by a first entrance side sheet, a first filter, a first rotatable flap, a bottom sheet and a top sheet; a second filtering chamber with side walls formed by a second entrance side sheet, a second filter, the said first rotatable flap, the said bottom sheet and the said top sheet; a first suction chamber with side walls formed by a first exit side sheet, a second rotatable flap, the said first filter, the said bottom sheet and the said top sheet, a second suction chamber with side walls formed by a second exit side sheet, the said second rotatable flap, the said second filter, the said bottom sheet and the said top sheet; a first waste cleaner and a second waste cleaner for pushing out waste fibre material collected by the respective first and second filter chambers to a waste chamber; a pair of pressure sensing switches for sensing the pressure difference between the respective pair of first and second filtering chambers and the pair of first and second suction chambers and actuate the respective pair of first and second waste cleaners; and a suction &amp;n to create an air draft Iâ€™m entrance to outlet.<br><br>
The invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figures 1 to 4 shows different views of the automatic suction filtering system according to the invention.<br>
A suction housing (1) consists of a housing top fi:ame (2), a housing bottom fi-ame (3), a bottom sheet (4), a top sheet (5), a motor fixing sheet (6) and a filter fixing sheet (7). A motor (8) is mounted on a motor fixing sheet (6) to drive a suction fan (9). Two rotatable flaps (10, 11) are mounted between a bottom sheet (4) and top sheet (5). The flaps (10, 11) can be simultaneously and individually rotated through an angle by the operation of two respective flap operating mechanisms (26, 27) such as pneumatic cylinders. A first and second filter (16 , 17) are fixed on the filter fixing sheet (7). A first entrance side sheet (12), a first rotatable flap (10), a first filter (16), the bottom sheet (4) and the top sheet (5) form a filtering chamber (18). A second entrance side sheet (13), a second filter (17), the first rotatable flap (10), the bottom sheet (4) and the top sheet (5) forms a second filtering chamber (19). A first exit side sheet (14), a second rotatable flap (11), the first filter (16), the bottom sheet (4) and the top sheet (5) forms a first suction chamber (20). A second exit side sheet (15), the second rotatable flap (11), the second filter (17), the bottom sheet (4) and the top sheet (5) form another suction chamber (21). Two evacuating mechanisms (28, 29) individually operate as waste cleaners (22, 23). They will push out the waste fiber material through outlet boxes (24, 25) to a waste chamber (30). A first pressure switch (33) senses the pressure difference between the first filtering chamber (18) and the first suction chamber (20).     A second<br><br>
pressure switch (34) senses the pressure difference between the second filtering chamber (19) and the second suction chamber (21).<br>
The suction air along with fiber material enters the suction filtering system at the entrance (31). Initially the first filtering chamber (18) is closed by the first flap (10) and the second filtering chamber (19) is open to the entrance (31). The first suction chamber (20) is closed by the second flap (11) and the second suction chamber (21) is open to the suction fan (9). The suction fen (9) creates a negative pressure in the second filtering chamber (19) and the second suction chamber (21). The air with waste fiber material is sucked fi-om the suction duct through the entrance (31). It is filtered by the second filter (17). The fihered air goes through the fen and it is passed out through outlet (32). Due to continuous accumulation of waste fiber material on the second filter (17) a batt is formed on the second filter(14). So the pressure in the second filtering chamber (19) increases and the pressure in the second suction chamber (21) decreases. This makes a difference in pressure between the second filtering chamber (19) and the second suction chamber (21). This pressure difference is sensed by the pressure switch (34) and actuate the flap operating mechanisms (26, 27) to rotate the first and second flaps (10, 11). Then the first filtering chamber (18) and the first suction chamber (20) are opened and the second filtering chamber (19) and the second suction chamber (21) are closed. Now the suction takes place through the first filtering chamber (18) and the first suction chamber (20).<br><br>
The evacuating mechanism (29) is operated to move downward and upward for a certain number of times to completely push out the waste fiber material through an outlet box (25), to a waste chamber (30). The operation of the evacuating mechanism is preferably controlled by a timer. The operation is repeated through filtering chamber (18) and suction chamber (20) in the next cycle. Because of these alternative operations the suction is continuous without any interference.<br>
Thus the automatic suction filtering system according to the invention continuous waste evacuation. The operation is continuous by time alternate operation of the two filtering chambers and two suction chambers. One set of filtering chamber and suction chamber is in operation continuously while the other set of filtering chamber and suction chamber is in closed condition for evacuating waste fiber material collected on the filter. It has a stationary filtering element and the waste fiber material cleaning fix)m the filter element is automatic.<br>
The automatic filtering system according to the invention can be effectively used for cleaning fiber waste material food desired locations in textile manufacturing units.<br><br><br>
