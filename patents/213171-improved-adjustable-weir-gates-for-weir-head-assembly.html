27-SEP-2007<br><br>
The present invention relates to an improved adjustable weir gates. More particularly it relates to a weir to adjust water head from zero to any required height in descending or ascending order and also to allow overtopping.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A weir performs the function of obstructing water flow through river or nallah or small channels by either constructing walls perpendicular to flow direction or by use of Mild Steel gates or wooden planks in between constructed columns to restrict flow. Weirs help to store water at a particular head and can be used for irrigation, drinking water or industrial use.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In prior art, system using wooden planks or Mild Steel gate is known. In between two banks of river /nalla concrete or brick/stone masonary wall columns are constructed at a specified distance. Two wooden planks are fixed in two rows in between two concrete columns and the gap between two planks is filled up with mud to avoid leakages. Number of planks one upon one can be increased or decreased as per requirement of water head. Mild Steel gate is replacement for wooden plank and instead of two rows it is in one row and similarly in ascending or descending arrangement as per water head requirement.<br>
DRAWBACKS OF PRIOR ART:<br>
1.	In wooden planks replacement is very early, i.e. after every two years<br>
2.	There is wastage of natural resources.<br>
3.	Mild Steel gates are not designed properly due to which leakage is heavy.<br>
4.	It is very difficult to remove or insert them.<br>
5.	Maintenance is tremendous and thus the recurring costs are high.<br>
6.	Life is limited due to corrosion.<br>
7.	It is useful only for adjusting water head at particular and fixed point depending on height of M.S. gate or wooden plank.<br><br>
8.0vertopping of water above gate is dangerous to break whole system. For example in wooden plank if overtopping is there gate may not sustain overload and may slip from grove made in Concrete Column and thereby cause damage to the entire system.<br>
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to adjust water head from zero to any required height in descending /ascending order and also allow overtopping to certain head. This is advantageous even in irrigation management &amp; canal systems because opening is in the direction down to up or up to down and also overtopping, while in prior art all controlling gates open from bottom side to upward side.<br>
In the present invention similar Concrete or brick masonary or steel columns are kept at a specified distance perpendicular to flow at a derived distance. Flow is restricted with gates made of Mild Steel or fiber glass reinforced plastic (FRP) or combination of both or with any ferrous or non-ferrous material. Width and height of gate or numbers depends on actual requirement of storage and site conditions.<br>
COMPARISON WITH PRIOR ART<br>
In prior art assembly of gates, weir is one upon one with nut bolting arrangement. This causes heavy leakages from every joint due to water pressure. As per the present invention weirs gates are curved shaped and telescopically  slide on each other in upward or downward direction. The said curved shaped gates having its convex portion exposed to water pressure.<br><br>
Whole assembly of said curved shaped gates slides in a M.S. bracket fixed at facing side of water individually or collectively. It can hold at any position for any gate as per the requirement of water head. The assembly of said curved shaped gate, if telescopically expanded for full height then maximum head of water can be stored. If water is to be totally drained then all the gates are lifted from bottom to top position like curtain. If limited drain is required then overtopping is allowed over the gate assembly. These gate assemblies are in series. So by arranging them in different positions in different sector, storage or drain can be decided by seeing inflow and outflow requirement.<br>
In prior art, weir systems gates are removed in rainy season by using winch. As per the present invention, weir gates assembly can be stretched in highest position in upward direction. So, according to present invention, to remove and transport gates is not necessary.<br>
In prior art, movement of gates weir is completely manual or by mechanical winch. As per present invention weir movement of gates can be controlled manually or by using mechanical methods pneumatic hydraulic or with electrical/electronic control system, for adjusting variable head or discharge for any universal position.<br>
Top of the said curved shaped gate is designed in such manner that discharge flow can be measured at in upstream side of gate assembly. This facility is available only in the present invention.<br>
At the bottom side of assembled gates a provision for electricity generation can be incorporated by using pipe outlet and turbines.<br>
Statement of invention<br>
An improved adjustable weir gates for weir head assembly comprises of<br>
plurality of hollow elongated gates being closed at top and open at the<br>
bottom, among said gates bottom most gate is placed in lower channel of<br>
the weir and said channel is fixed in bed concrete. Said gates are arranged<br>
in such a manner that outer body of first gate is slidable in inner hollow<br><br>
portion of second gate. Outer body of first gate is slidable in inner hollow portion of third gate. Outer body of third gate is slidable in inner hollow portion of forth gate, and so on and thereby making telescopically expanding and contracting arrangement. A sliding mechanism comprising of gear or pulley arrangement for lifting or lowering said gates. Controlling unit to control the operation of said sliding mechanism, wherein said telescopically arranged gates are placed in a mild steel bracket with sealing arrangement and said telescopically arranged gates are slidable in upward and downward direction within said mild steel bracket as per requirement. Top portion of the gates is curved. Said gates are "U" shaped. Gates are made of ferrous or non ferrous metal or fibre glass or any of the said combinations and coated with anti corrosive material.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
(A)      As per prior art weirs are useful only in river or nalla for limited storage. Weirs as per present invention can be used in river or nalla with more storage capacity and also can adjust accurately according to inflow / outflow requirements. Also leakages in weir, as per the present invention, will be minimum, which save lot of water.<br>
(B)	In irrigation canal system controlling gates are used for flowing water, which lifts only from bottom, and overtopping is dangerous. So storage facility is not possible in prior art. As per the present invention, weirs storage is possible, overtopping is allowed so can be used for multipurpose for flowing water. Also discharge can be measured and useful to increase command area of irrigation.<br>
(C)	For small tanks or nallas weirs are constructed by keeping permanent concrete, bricks stone masonary wall, for fixed head. Weirs, as per the present invention, are best replacement to raise water head to maximum level as per maximum inflow condition.<br><br>
(D)	For waste weir, M.S. Gates or permanent walls are constructed in tanks.<br>
Inflow in rainy season is always more with weirs as per the present invention. More<br>
precise planning is possible as it can be adjusted to any head.<br>
(E)	In kharland area, water head is more due to tidal force. So, the weirs as per<br>
the present invention can be used to protect irrigated land from saline water by<br>
stretching gates to required position.<br>
(F)	Productivity of salt preparation can be increased by putting weirs as per the<br>
present invention to maintain required head.<br>
(G)	In weirs, as per the present invention, electricity can be generated in canal<br>
rivers, nalla, kharland area in limited manner.<br>
In India, scarcity of water is due to limited storage facility and erratic rainfall. The present invention is a solution to increase storage facility especially in scarcity area. Electricity generation, discharge measurement facility or use in kharland area is additional advantages. Even in flood position these improved weirs can be used to stop or divert the water from the flooded areas elsewhere.<br>
