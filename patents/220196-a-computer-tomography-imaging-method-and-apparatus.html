				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a CT (Computer Tomography) imaging method and an X-ray CT apparatus, and more particularly to a CT imaging method and an X-ray CT apparatus capable of producing a CT image in a short time.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 5 is a diagram explaining the conventional CT imaging method. For the expedience of explanation, one frame of image is assumed to be composed by eight pieces of image data All through A42. The X-ray sensor array in use is assumed to have four channels, of which the 1st-channel sensor produces image data All and A12, the 2nd-channel sensor produces image data A21 and A22, the 3rd-channel sensor produces image data A31 and A32, and the 4th-channel sensor produces image data A41 and A42. The X-ray sensors of 1st through 4th channels are provided with modification data Bl, B2, B3 and B4, respectively. The image data pairs All and A22, A21 and A32, A31 and A42, and A41 and A12 are each derived from parallel X-ray transmission paths.<br>
The X-ray CT apparatus has a central processor, which is assumed to include a master processor MP and four slave processors SP1 through SP4.<br>
The master processor MP groups the image data based on their originating X-ray sensors, and distributes the resulting paired data to the slave processors SP1 through SP4. At the<br>
same time, the master processor MP sends the modification data corresponding to the X-ray sensors to the slave processors SP1 through SP4.<br>
Specifically, the first slave processor SP1 is supplied with cats pair All and A12 produced by the Ist-channel sensor and the modification data Bl corresponding to that sensor. The second slave processor SP2 is supplied with data pair A21 and A22 produced by the 2nd-channel sensor and the modification data B2 corresponding to that sensor. The third slave processor SP3 is supplied with data pair A31 and A32 produced by the 3rd-channeil sensor and the modification data B3 corresponding to that sensor. The fourth slave processor SP4 is supplied with data pair A41 and A42 produced by the 4th-channel sensor and the modification data B4 corresponding to that sensor.<br>
Since a data pair supplied to each slave processor have fan-out X-ray transmission paths, these image data will be called "fan-view data".<br>
The slave processors SP1 through SP4 implement the first pre-processing for the supplied data pair All and A12 through data pair A41 and A42 by using the supplied modification data Bl through B4, thereby producing a new data pair all and a!2 through data pair a41 and a42 .<br>
The master processor MP collects the data pair all and a12 through data pair a41 and a42 produced by the slave processors SP1 through SP4, groups the data into data pairs each<br>
derived from parallel X-ray transmission paths, and distributes the paired data to the slave processors SP1 through SP4.<br>
Specifically, the image data is grouped into data pair all and a22, data pair a21 and a32, data pair a31 and a42, and data pair a41 and a!2, and these data pairs are supplied to the first, second, third and fourth slave processors SPl, SP2, SP3 and SF4, respectively. Since a data pair supplied to each slave processor have parallel X-ray transmission paths, these image data will be called "para-view data". The above-mentioned data grouping process from fan-view data into para-view data will be called "fan-para data conversion".<br>
The slave processors SP1 through SP4 implement the second pre-processing for the supplied data pair all and a22 through data pair a41 and a!2, thereby producing a new data pair all and a:l2 through data pair a41 and a!2.<br>
The slave processors SPl through SP4 further implement the FBP (Filtered Back Projection) process for the data pair all and a22 through data pair α41 and α12, thereby producing new delta i1 through i4. The resulting back-projected data il through i4 will be called "BP data",<br>
The master processor MP collects the BP data il through i4 produced by the slave processors SPl through SP4, and composes the data to produce a CT image I.<br>
As described above, the conventional scheme is designed to distribute the fan-view data to the slave processors SPl<br>
through SP4 to carry out the first pre-processing. It is convenient in that the slave processors SP1 through SP4 are merely supplied with the modification data Bl through B4, respectively.<br>
However, it suffers an extended processing time due to the data transfer for the collection of data pair all and a!2 through data pair a41 and a42 resulting from the first pre-processing to the master processor MP and the data transfer for the distribution of para-view data pair all and a22 through data pair a41 and a!2 to the slave processors SP1 through SP4.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a CT imaging method and an X-ray CT apparatus capable of producing a CT image in a shorter time.<br>

produced by the X-ray sensors into data groups each derived from<br>
parallel X-ray transmission paths, distributes the grouped data to a<br>
plurality of slave processors, collects output data from the slave<br>
processors and composes the data to produce a CT image; and<br>

Although, in this case, same modification data need to be sent twice to the slave processors, the slave processors can implement the first pre-processing up to the post processing continuously, eliminating the need of collection of the output data of the first pre-processing and transfer of para-viewdata to the slave processors. As a result, the total processing time can be reduced, and a CT image can be produced in a shorter time.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in connection with the following illustrated embodiments. Embodiment 1:<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of the X-ray CT apparatus based on the first embodiment of this invention. The X-ray CT apparatus 100 has an operation console 1, an imaging table 10, and a gantry scanner 20.<br>
The operation console 1 incorporates an input device 2 which is used by the operator to enter instructions and information, a central processor 3 which implements the imaging process and image composing process, a control interface 4 which transacts control signals with the imaging table 10 and gantry scanner 20, a data collection buffer 5 which collects image data produced by the gantry scanner 20, a CRT screen 6 which displays a CT image resulting from the composition of the image data, and a memory which stores programs and image data.<br>
The imaging table 10, with a subject body being placed therecn, is operated to move in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the subject body.<br>
The gantry scanner 20 incorporates an x-ray controller 21, a eollimator controller 22, an X-ray tube 30, a collimator 40, a sensor array 50 which consists of multiple X-ray sensors, a data collector 23, and a rotation controller 24 which operates to turn the X-ray tube 30, etc. around the longitudinal axis of the subject body.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the principal arrangement of the central processor 3. The central processor 3 includes a master processor MP, four slave processors SPl through SP4, a memory GM, and an internal bus BUS.<br>
Fig. 3 explains the CT imaging process implemented by the central processor 3. For the expedience of explanation, one frame of image,is assumed to be composed by eight pieces of image data A.'Ll through A42 . The X-ray sensor array is assumed to have four channels, of which the 1st-channel sensor produces image data All and A12, the 2nd-channel sensor produces image data A21 anc3 A22, the 3rd-channel sensor produces image data A31 and A32, and the 4th-channel sensor produces image data A41 and A42 . The X-ray sensors of 1st through 4th channels are provided with modification data Bl, B2, B3 and B4, respectively. The image data pairs All and A22, A21 and A32, A31 and A42, and A41 and A12 are each derived from parallel X-ray transmission paths.<br>
The master processor MP groups the image data produced by each of X-ray sensors into data pairs each derived from<br>
parallel X-ray transmission paths, and distributes the resulting paired data to the slave processors SP1 through SP4. At the same time, the master processor MP sends the modification data corresponding to the X-ray sensors to the slave processors SP1 through SP4.<br>
Specifically, the image data All and A12 produced by the -Ist-channel sensor, image data A21 and A22 produced by the 2nd-channel sensor, image data A31 and A32 produced by the 3rd-channel sensor, and image data A41 and A42 produced by the • 4th-channel sensor are grouped into data pair All and A22, data pair A21 and A32, data pair A31 and A42, and data pair A41 and A12, each derived from parallel X-ray transmission paths. The first slave processor SP1 is supplied with the data pair All and A22 and the modification data Bl and B2 corresponding to the 1st and 2nd-channel sensors. The second slave processor SP2 is supplied with the data pair A21 and A32 and the modification data B2 and B3 corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd channel sensors. The third slave processor SP3 is supplied with the data pair A31 and A42 and the modification data B3 and B4 corresponding to the 3rd and 4th channel sensors . The fourth slave processor SP4 is supplied with the data pair A41 and A12 and the modification data B4 and Bl corresponding to the 4th and 1s- channel sensors. Since a data pair supplied to each slave processor have parallel x-ray transmission paths, these image data will be called "para-view data". The above-<br>
mentioned data grouping process from fan-view data Into para-view data will be called "fan-para data conversion".<br>
The alave processor SPl implements the first preprocessing for the supplied data pair All and A22 by using the supplied modification data Bl and B2 thereby to produce a new data pair all and a22. • Similarly, the slave processor SP2 implements the first pre-processing for the supplied data pair A21 and A32 by using the supplied modification data B2 and B3 thereby to produce a new data pair a21 and a32 . The slave processor SP3 implements the first pre-processing for the supplied data pair A31 and A42 by using the supplied modification data B3 and B4 thereby to produce a nnw data pair a31 and a42. The slave processor SP4 implements the first pre-processing for the supplied data pair A41 and A12 by using the supplied modification data B4 and Bl thereby to produce a new data pair a41 and a!2.<br>
Subsequently, the slave processors SPl through SP4 implement the second pre-processing for the data pair all and a22 through data pair a41 and al2 to produce new data pair all and ct22 through data pair a41 and al2.<br>
The slave processors SPl through SP4 further implement the FBP process for the data pair all and ct22 through data pair a41 and al2, and implement the post processing, thereby producing new data il through 14 . The resulting back-projected data il through i4 will be called "BP data".<br>
The master processor MP collects the EP data il through i4 produced by the slave processors SPI through SP4, and composes the data to produce a CT image I.<br>
According to the foregoing X-ray CT apparatus 100, although same modification data need to be sent twice to the slave processors SPI through SP4, the slave processors can implement the first pre-processing up t.o the post processing continuously. As a result, the total processing time can be reduced, and a CT image can be produced in a shorter time. Embodiment 2:<br>
In the case of producing CT images continuously, the four slave processors SPI through SP4 are divided into let-group slave processors SPI and SP2 and 2nd-group slave processors SP3 and SP4. The-lst-group slave processors SPI and SP2 operate to produce odd-numbered CT images II, 13, 15, and so on in the same manner as the preceding first embodiment, while the 2nd-group slave processors SP3 and SP4 operate to produce even-numbered CT images 12, 14, 16, and so on in the same manner as the first embodiment.<br>
In contrast to the first embodiment, in which the master processor MP needs to collect the BP data II through 14 from the four slave processors SPI through SP4, it is sufficient for the master processor MP of the second embodiment to collect the BP data II through 14 only from the two slave processors SPI and SP2, or SP3 and SP4, whereby the data transfer time can be<br><br>
reduced.<br>
Many widely different embodiments of the invention may be constructed without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. It should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments described in the specification, except as defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
