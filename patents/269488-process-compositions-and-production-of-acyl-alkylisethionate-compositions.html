Due mainly to its low water solubility, SCI is not suitable for use in liquid cleansers. One method for improving SCI's limited water solubility is to combine SCI with other surfactants such as taurate, amphoacetates and betaines. This combination of surfactants, however, produces relatively hazy solution, which tend to separate during storage.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to produce acyl isethionate esters that are highly water soluble, hydrolytically-stable and non-irritating for use in aqueous as well as non-aqueous consumer products such as personal care cleansers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes certain preferred combinations of the acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions, processes for forming the acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions, and additional processing thereof into useful articles. The present invention also includes alkyl-substituted hydroxyalkyi sulfonates and methods of preparing alkyl-substituted hydroxyalkyl sulfonates.<br>
One embodiment of the invention is a process comprising: providing at least one alkylene oxide having between 2 and 8 carbon atoms; providing an aqueous solution comprising a biÂ¬sulfite anion. The alkylene oxide is contacted with the aqueous solution while maintaining a pH between about 5 and about 10. A mixture is then formed of (i)        a first isomer having the structure:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
An alternative embodiment of the invention is a persona] care cleanser comprising:<br>
an acyl alkylisethionate ester composition having two or more esters according to the formula:<br><br>
wherein at least a first ester comprises R having a hydrocarbon group having between about 4 and 25 carbon atoms, R1 and R2 each comprise a straight chain or branched C| to Ce alkyl group or a hydrogen atom with at least one of R1 or R2 comprising the alkyl group and at least one of R1 or R2 comprising the hydrogen atom, and at least a second ester comprises R having a hydrocarbon group having between about 4 and 25 carbon atoms, R| comprises a hydrogen atom, R2 comprises a hydrogen atom, and X for the first ester ion and the second ester ion are each selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, zinc, aluminum, ammonium, ammonium ions substituted with one or more organic groups, and combinations thereof.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following is a detailed description of certain preferred combinations of the acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions, processes for forming the acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions, and additional processing thereof into useful articles. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous modifications to these preferred embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, while certain specific acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions are exemplified, other compositions are also contemplated. Additionally, while some products are discussed as uses for the composition, other uses, are also contemplated.<br>
The present invention provides processes for forming acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions. The acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions generally have improved solubility and hydrolytic stability as compared to acyl isethionate compositions while retaining beneficial properties including, high-tight foaming, and non-irritating to human tissue. The acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions would be useful as primary or secondary surfactants in aqueous and non-aqueous consumer products such as personal care cleansers. The acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions may include isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters, a blend of an acyl alkylisethionate ester and an acyl isethionates ester, or mixtures thereof. Salt derivatives of the esters described herein may also be used for the respective esters in forming the acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions.<br>
An acyl alkylisethionate ester herein refers to an acyl isethionate ester in which at least one hydrogen atom on the alkyl moiety of the isethionate portion of the molecule is substituted with an alkyl group. For example, an alkyl group is substituted onto at least one carbon atom of the alkane sulfonate portion of the acyl isethionate ester. An acyl isethionate ester herein refers to an isethionate ester without an alkyl substitution, such as sodium cocoyl isethionate<br><br>
(SCI). In one embodiment of the invention, the acyl alkylisethionate ester has the following general formula (I): <br>
wherein R is any hydrocarbon group having between 4 and 25 carbon atoms; R| and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a branched or straight aliphatic C1 to C6 alkyl group; and X is any cationic species present for charge neutrality such as hydrogen, ammonium and ammonium ions which are substituted with one or more organic groups, an alkali metal including sodium, potassium, and lithium, an alkaline earth metal including calcium and magnesium, zinc, aluminum, and combinations thereof, in a preferred embodiment, only one of R| and R2 is a branched or straight aliphatic C| to C(, alkyl group while the remaining R| or R2 is hydrogen. The respective compounds having the aliphatic group on R|, or alternatively, R2 form the respective isomers of the compound of Formula (I). An example of a compound is sodium cocoyl methyl isethionate (SCMI).<br>
In another example, ths. acyl alkylisethionate ester is an alkyl-substituted acylpropylsulfonate ester having the general formula (II):<br><br>
R may comprise any hydrocarbon group having between 4 and 25 carbon atoms. R is preferably selected from the groujj consisting of straight-chain hydrocarbon groups, branched hydrocarbon groups, saturated hydrocarbon groups, unsaturated hydrocarbon groups, and combinations thereof. R\, R2, and R3 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and a branched or straight aliphatic C1 to C6 alkyl group. In one prefeaed embodiment of the formula, one of R1 and R2 and R3 is a branched or straight aliphatic C1 to Ce alkyl group while the remaining functional groups, R1, R2, or R3, are hydrogen. Alternatively, two of R1 and R2 and R3 are a branched or straight aliphatic C1 to Ce alkyl group while the remaining functional group, K\, R2, or Rj, is hydrogen. In another embodiment, R| and R? and R3 are each a branched or straight aliphatic Ci to Ce alkyl group.<br><br>
In another embodiment, R\ and R2 and R3 are each hydrogen. X may be any cationic species present for charge neutrality such as hydrogen, an alkali metal such as sodium, potassium and lithium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, aluminum, ammonium and ammonium ions which are substituted with one or more organic groups.<br>
Isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters of the present invention may be prepared by direct esterification of one or more alkyl-substituted isethionates, for example methyl-substituted isethionates. In an embodiment, isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters of the present invention may be prepared by contacting two or more alkyl-substituted isethionates in the presence of a carboxylic acid. In another embodiment, isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters of the present invention may be prepared by contacting one, two, or more alkyl-substituted isethionates and at least one sodium isethionate in the presence of a carboxylic acid. The isomeric alkyl-substituted isethionates may be prepared by reacting an alkylene oxide(s) with anions derived from a mineral acid, such as an aqueous solution of bisulfite anions. Preferred alkylene oxides have between 2 and 8 carbon atoms per molecule. The invention contemplates that alkylene oxides having 2 or more carbon atoms may be used. Examples of suitable alkylene oxides used in preparing the isethionates may include propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, butylene oxide, and combinations thereof<br>
The aqueous solution of bisulfite may have a concentration from about 10% to about 70% by weight, such as between about 20% and about 50%, for exam.ple, between about 30% and about 45%. The aqueous solution of bisulfite may include any alkali metal aqueous solution â¢ of bisulfite, such as sodium or potassium bisulfite. Additionally, the aqueous bisulfite solution may contain one or more cations such as sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium, and ammonium ions are present in the aqueous bisulfite solution to maintain charge neutrality, and in fact any ion by which charge neutrality may be accomplished is suitably included in the aqueous solution, including mono-positive ions, di-positive ions, and triply positive ions. The cations may form salts with the anions formed during the reaction. For example, sodium alkylisethionates (SAI) may be produced from the presence of sodium ions in the aqueous solution. In an embodiment, the aqueous solution is comprised of sulfite ions and bi-sulfite ions. Preferably the aqueous solution comprises 25 wt. % to 99 wt. % sulfite ions and I wt. % to 75. wt % bi-sulfite ions.   In another embodiment, the aqueous solution<br><br>
comprises 40 wt. % to 99 wt. % sulfite ions and 1 wt. % to 60 wt. % bi-sulfite ions. In an embodiment, the aqueous solution, comprising bi-sulfite ions or a combination of hydroxide solution and sulftir dioxide.<br>
In one embodiment, the alkyl-substituted isethionate is an alky-substituted hydroxyethane sulfonate produced by the following reactions:<br>
(I)<br>
O                                                       Ri R2                                R3 ^<br>

/   \                                                               II.	II.<br>
pRâCH âCH2 +	p HSO3-    	^    q HO-CHCHâSO3	+   r HO-CHCH^S03_<br>
R is a C| to Cs alkyl group, R| and R? are each independently selected from the group of hydrogen and a C\ to C(, alkyl group. In a preferred embodiment of a compound from reaction (I), only one of R| and R2 is hydrogen while the other is a Ci to Cs alkyl group. R3 and R4 are each independently selected fi-om the group of hydrogen and a Ci to Ce alkyl group. In a preferred embodiment of a compound fi-om reaction (I), only one of R3 and R4 is hydrogen while the other is a Ci to Ce alkyl group. Q + r is equal to p for both reactions (I) and (II).<br>
The respective presence of alkyl group (R) on the first and second carbon atoms, as shown in reaction (II), of the anions, may form substituted primary and secondary hydroxy! isomeric sulfonates. Preferably, the molar ratios of the substituted secondary hydroxy! carbon to substituted primary hydroxyl carbon at between about 19:1 to about 1:19, between about 19:1 and about 4:1, such as between about 17:3 and about 19:1, for example, about 15:1 to about 1:15. Preferably, propylene oxide, butylene oxide and oxides up to six carbon atoms are used to produce isomers containing primary hydroxyls and secondary hydroxyl sulfonates. The ratio may vary depending upon-the reaction conditions and production of by products such as<br><br>
propylene glycol, butylene glycol, propoxylated/butoxylated sodium alkylisethionates, among others.<br>
In one example of the reaction, propylene oxide is reacted with sodium bisulfite/sulfite to produce sodium 2-methy! 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate and/or sodium 1-methyl 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate or a mixture thereof. In another example butylene oxide is reacted with sodium bisulfite/sulfite to produce sodium 2-ethyl 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate and/or sodium 1 -ethyl 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate or a mixture thereof.<br>
Additionally, a mixture of alkyl-substituted isethionate may be formed by using one or more oxides. In one example, a mixture of propylene oxide and butylene oxide is reacted with sodium bisulfite/sulfite to produce sodium 2-methyI 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate, sodium 2-ethyl 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate, sodium 1-methyl 2-hydroxyethane sulfonate, and/or sodium<br>
]-ethyl-2-hydraxyethane sulfonate, or mixtures thereof In one example, a mixture of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and/or butylene oxide may be used to generate a mixture of sodium alkylisethionate and sodium isethionate compounds.<br>
The various oxides can be combined in any proportion by. varying molar ratios to obtain the desired amounts of each alkyl-substituted hydroxyalkyl sulfonate, in one example, a preferred mixture of alkylisethionates and isethionates can be produced by mixing propylene oxide, and/or butylene oxide with ethylene oxide in any proportion containing ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and/or butylene oxide, or a combination thereof. The oxide mixture produces isethionates, and isomeric mixtures of methylisethionates, and/or ethylisethionates, in the above reactions.<br>
The alkyl-substituted isethionate may be used in the esterification process as follows to form an acyl alkylisethionate that is, completely water soluble sodium cocoyl alkylisethionate esters (SCAI) by reaction of SAI with fatty acids and a catalyst(s), and unlike pure SCI, water soluble to generate clear formulations for personal care applications.<br>
During production of the alkyl-substituted isethionates, also referred herein as alkylisethionates, the pH of the reaction solution comprising the alkylene oxide and bisulfite<br><br>
may range from about 4 to about 10. A preferred pH of the reaction solution may be between about 5 to about 10. It is believed such a pH range will minimize side reactions and side products such as diols. In another preferred pH level, the pH of the reaction solution may be maintained optimally at a pH of about 7. It is believed that such a pH level will maximize production of alkyl-substituted isethionates having a high content of secondary ester link carbons. To maintain the pH of the reaction solution at a desired pH range during the entire reaction, a weak acid or buffering acid and/or more bisulfite may be added to the reaction solution as needed.<br>
Alternatively a mixture of alkylisethionates could be made by forming the alkyl-substituted isethionates from respective oxides, such as propylene oxide and butylene oxide, separately and then combined into one mixture before the esterification process. The respective amount of the individual alkyl-substituted isethionates formed from the respective oxides may be detemiined for the esterification process to produce isethionates with desired properties, such as a desired viscosity or solubility. The use of a mixture of alkyl-substituted isethionates from reaction with the respective oxides has been observed to have lowered the melt point and improved homogeneity of the mixture at lower temperature, and decreased reaction times, of the products formed in the subsequent esterification process.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the alkyl-substituted isethionates are prepared by making the bisulfite/sulfite in situ by reacting a hydroxide solution, such as sodium hydroxide, with sulfiir dioxide under pressure. Suitable hydroxide solution concentrations include 10, 25, and 50% by weight sodium hydroxide, alternatively the solution may comprises a sodium hydroxide concentration of from about 25% by weight to about 45% by weight. Suitable hydroxide solutions include potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or combinations thereof In a preferred embodiment of the hydroxide solution, the hydroxide solution may comprise a 50% by weight sodium hydroxide solution. The alkylene oxide can be added concurrently or after to produce the corresponding isethionates and alkyl-substituted isethionates.<br>
Furthermore, the temperature and pressure of the reaction solution during production of the alkyl-substituted isethionates may range between about 20Â°C and about 200Â°C, such as<br><br>
between about 30Â°C and about 95Â°C, for example between about 50Â°C and about 80Â°C; and from between about 0.00 psi to about 103 psi, such as between about 2.0 psi and about 7.0 psi , for example, between about 10.00 psi and about 50 psi respectively. The temperature and pressure of the reaction solution may be held constant during the entire reaction or one or both may be raised or lowered at any time for any time period to produce the desired alkyl-substituted isethionate.<br>
Furthermore, the alkyl-substituted isethionates may be prepared as a liquid or in solid form. For example, the alkyl-substituted isethionates may first be prepared in liquid form then dried to form a powder. A preferred method of drying the alkyl-substituted isethionates is spray drying. For example, alkyl-substituted isethionates are prepared in liquid form by reacting propylene oxide and/or butylene oxide with sodium bisulfite. The liquid salts of the alkyl-substituted isethionate are then spray dried to the corresponding powder form. The alkyl-substituted isethionate powders have been found to be less hygroscopic and therefore easier to handle than non-alkyl-substituted isethionate powders making their transportation more efficient and less expensive. In addition, use of the alkyl-substituted isethionate powder allows for the elimination of a water removal step that is normally required when using a liquid alkyl-substituted isethionate during direct esterification.<br>
The alkyl-substituted isethionates may then be used in producing the acyl alkylisethionate esters of the present invention by direct esterification of an alkyl-substituted isethionate mixture with a carboxylic acid. More than one alkyl-substituted isethionates mixture and/or more than one carboxylic acid may be used in the esterification reaction. Esterification occurs by mixing alkyl-substituted isethionate with carboxylic acids and optionally an esterification catalyst under esterification conditions. The alkyl-substituted isethionate can be present as the salt of the alkyl-substituted isethionate or in its acidic form. Alternatively, a composition of alkyl-substituted isethionate and isethionate may also be used in the esterification process.<br>
Esterification for one embodiment may occur according to the reaction (III):<br><br>
O	t^t^O	o       R,  R20<br>
II	I     I     II	II	I      I    II<br>

O	^<br>
R is any hydrocarbon group having between about 4 and about 25 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon group may include straight-chain, branched, saturated, unsaturated hydrocarbon groups, and combinations thereof. R| and R2 may each independently be hydrogen or an alky! group having 1 to 6 carbons, Ci to Ce alkyl. In a preferred embodiment of the reaction, at least one of Ri and R2 is hydrogen and at least one of at least one of Ri and R2 is a Ci to Ce alkyl group. X is a cationic species present for charge neutrality. Suitable cationic species are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, zinc, aluminum, ammonium, and ammonium ions which are substituted with one or more organic groups, and combinations thereof. When X is hydrogen, the alkyl-substituted alkylisethionic acid is present, which we have surprisingly found to be catalytic during esteriftcation. X can be present as hydrogeri by addition of any strong acid, however, it is most preferable to add the alkyl-substituted alkylisethionic acid itself in its pure form when it is added as an esterification catalyst.<br>
In one embodiment of an acyl alkyl isethionate ester composition, the composition includes a blend of isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters with acyl isethionate esters. A composition including the blend of the isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters and the acyl isethionate esters may be achieved by independently producing the respective esters and then mixing the esters in desired ratios to obtain a desired solubility. Alternatively, a composition including a blend of the isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters with acyl isethionate esters may be achieved by blending alkyl-substituted isethionate and isethionate precursors, such as sodium alkylisethionate and sodium isethionate, respectively, prior to esterifi cation as described herein. In either composition formation process, the molar ratio of isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters to acyl isethionate esters in the composition may be between about 0.5:9.5 and about 9.5:0.5, such as between about 3:7 and about 7:3. Alternatively, a mixture of isomeric acyl alkylisethionate esters, as described herein, may be substituted for the isomeric in the composition described abc"<br><br>
The acyl isethionate esters have the formula (IV):<br>
H   H<br>
I     I<br>
RCOO âCHCH	SO3X ^<br>
R is any hydrocarbon group having between 4 and 25 carbon atoms. R is preferably selected from the group consisting of straight-chain hydrocarbon groups, branched hydrocarbon groups, saturated hydrocarbon groups, unsaturated hydrocarbon groups, and combinations thereof. X may be Â£my cationic species present for charge neutrality such as hydrogen, ammonium and ammonium ions which are substituted with one or more organic groups, an alkali metal including sodium, potassium, and lithium, an alkaline earth metal including calcium and magnesium, zinc, aluminum, and combinations thereof. An example of a compound is sodium cocoyl isethionate ester (SCI).<br>
In one embodiment of the esterification reaction, isethionates may be included with alkyl-substituted isethionates to co-produce acyl isethionate esters from the isethionates with the production of the acyl alkylisethionate esters from alkyl-substituted isethionates during the same reaction process. For example, sodium cocoyl isethionate esters and sodium cocoyl alkylisethionates may be produced from an esterification reaction using sodium isethionates and sodium alkylisethionates as reactants with the carboxylic acid. In a mixed isethionate and alkyl-substituted isethionate reaction, the ratio of isethionate to alkyl-substituted isethionate may be between about 0.5:9.5 and about 9.5:0.5, such as between about 3:7 and about 7:3. The ratios are illustrative, and the invention contemplates that the ratio of the respective components may be varied to produce compounds having desired physical properties, such as solubility. Suitable isethionate compounds include 10, 20, 30 wt% isethionate and the balance is alkyl-substituted isethionate. The ratio are illustrative, and the invention contemplates that the ratio of the respective components may be varied to produce compounds having desired physical properties, such as solubility.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that a mixed isethionate and alkyl-substituted isethionate esterfication reaction can occur at a lower temnerature. at about 200Â°r! for a SI and SMT<br><br>
reaction, than the individual isethionate components, about 220Â°C to about 250Â°C for SMI and SI esterification reactions.<br>
The carboxylic acids employed in producing the esters of the present invention have the general formula (IV): R-COOH where R is any hydrocarbon group having between about 4 to about 25 carbon atoms. The R hydrocarbon group can be saturated or unsaturated, and straight-chain, branched, and combinations thereof. Generally, an excess of carboxylic acid is used in producing the esters of the present invention. Thus, the amount of carboxylic acid used may range from a mole ratio of carboxylic acid to isethionate of 1.5:1 to 1.1:1. However, a mole ratio range of carboxylic acid to isethionate as high as 2:1 to as low as 0.9:1 may be used if desired.<br><br>
Examples of carboxylic acids suitable for use in the present invention include: coco acid; butyric acid; hexanoic acid; caproic acid; caprylic acid; capric acid; lauric acid; myristic acid; palmitic acid; palmitoleic acid; stearic acid; oleic acid; linoleic acid; arachidic acid; gadoleic acid; arachidonic acid; (EPA); behinic acid; eruic acid; (DHA); lignoceric acid; naturally occurring fatty acids such as coconut oil, tallow, palm kernel oil, butterfat, palm oil, olive oil, com oil, linseed oil, peanut oil, fish oil and rapeseed oil; synthetic fatty acids made as chains of a single length or a selected distribution of chain lengths; and mixtures of any of the foregoing.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that fatty acids obtained from naturally occurring sources are mixtures of acids having various carbon chains of various lengths. Therefore, it is within the scope of this invention to use one or more naturally occurring fatty acids (including mixtures thereof), synthetic fatty acids (including mixtures thereof) and mixtures of both natural and synthetic fatty acids. Moreover, "coco acid" or "coco fatty acid" as used herein is a commercial fatty acid mixture containing a range of carboxylic acids having chain lengths of between about Cg to Cis, and some saturation which may be removed by hydrogenation. Thus, hydrogenated coco acid is a mixture of carboxylic acids having Cg to C|8 chain lengths, mostly lauric and myristic, together with some capric and caprylic acids, and contains very little, if any, unsaturation.<br>
In producing an acyl alkylisethionate ester by the reaction of a carboxylic acid with an alkylisethionate, such as an alkyl-substituted hydroxyethane sulfonate, the carbon atom of the hydroxyethane sulfonate portion of the molecule connected to the oxygen atom of the ester linkage is herein referred to as the "ester link carbon atom." It has been surprisingly found that when the alkylisethionate contains a high degree of ester link carbons that are secondary carbon atoms, the hydrolytic stability of the final acyl alkylisethionate ester product is substantially increased. No similar increase in hydrolj/tic stability has been observed with regards to increasing the secondary carbon content of the other carbon atom bonded directly to the sulfur atom in the alkylisethionate. Therefore, it is highly desirable to produce an alkyl-substituted isethionate that permits an acyl alkylisethionate ester produced therefrom to possess as high a degree of ester link carbons which are secondary carbon atoms as possible.<br><br>
Additionally, an esterification catalyst may be employed and combined with the alkyl-substituted isethionate and carboxylic acid. Esterification catalysts suitable for use include alkylisethionic acids, salts of hydroxyalkane sulfonates, methane sulfonic acid, p-toluene. sulfonic acid, inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, boric acid or their anhydrides, heavy metal salts such as zinc sulfate, zirconium sulfate, zinc isethionate, zinc alkylisethionates, zinc cocoate, zinc citrate, zinc borate, aluminurn sulfate, titanium sulfate or tungsten phosphate, metal oxides such as zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, cerium oxide, zirconium oxide or lanthanum oxide, organic acids such as citric acid and glycolic acid, and also mixtures of two or more of these catalysts, and soaps formed from heavy metals and metal oxides. The esterification catalyst may be employed in an amount from 0.05 to 2% by weight, preferably from 0.05% to 1% by weight, based on total weight of the reactants.<br>
In one embodiment, the acy] alkylisethionate sster is prepared using the acidic form of alkyl-substituted hydroxyethane sulfonate as the esterification catalyst. The alkyl-substituted hydroxyethane isethionic acid can be added in its pure form or a strong acid can be added to the reaction mixture containing carboxylic acid and salt of the alkyl-substituted hydroxyethane isethionate to convert the isethionate salt to the acidic form.<br>
The dual use of the alkyl-substituted hydroxyethane sulfonate as both a reactant and a catalyst is preferred since there is no need to quench or to remove the catalyst, there is no catalyst residues so there is minimal change in the molecular weight distribution of the acyl alkylisethionate ester, manufacturing capital expenditures are reduced and processing time is decreased.<br>
In general detail, the esterification reaction can be conducted by charging the carboxylic acid, alkyl-substituted isethionate and isethionate as necessary, and optionally the esterification catalyst under atmospheric pressure or vacuum to a reaction vessel. The reaction vessel is flushed thoroughly with dry inert gas, such as nitrogen. Direct esterification is carried out by heating the reaction mixture to the reaction temperature with stirring. The water that may be introduced into the reaction mixture with the starting components and the water that is formed as a result of the esterification reaction is discharged from the reaction vessel. In<br><br>
addition, it may be also be required to distill off some of the excess carboxylic acid during the course of the esterification reaction. The reaction time to complete esterification will vary from 1 to 12 hours depending on the reaction temperature, and if present, the amount of esterification catalyst. The final ester product can then be delivered in liquid or solid form, such as a solution, powder, flakes or paste, for use as a raw material in the formulation of personal care cleansers.<br>
The esterification reaction may be performed in a reaction vessel under atmospheric pressure. However, to aid in water removal, mild vacuum (500-550 mm Hg) may be applied during commencement of the charging of the reactants or anytime during the reaction. Applying mild vacuum also allows for water removal without distilling of the carboxylic acid. Preferably, the vacuum applied is not allowed to drop below 500 mm Hg so as to prevent carboxylic acid distillation when such is not desired.<br>
Generally, the reaction vessel is heated to a single reaction temperature range. However, the process can employ more than one reaction temperature range. For example, the reaction vessel may be heated to a first reaction temperature range and held at that temperature range for a period of time to remove water, then subsequently heated further to a second temperature range higher than the first and held for a period of time. The reaction temperature ranges employed during the esterification reaction may range from about 180Â° C to about 240Â°C. However, it has been surprisingly found that if alkyl-substituted isethionic acid is used as the catalyst, the reaction temperature can be lowered to a temperature range of about 90Â°C to about ISO^C, preferably about 120Â°C to about 160Â°C.<br>
In one embodiment, the acyl alkylisethionate ester is produced by combining one or more carboxylic acids and one or more sodium salts of the alkyl-substituted isethionate with an alkyl-substituted isethionic acid catalyst to a reaction vessel. Additionally, an isethionate ester may be formed in situ with the acyl alkylisethionate ester as described herein. The reaction vessel is purged using nitrogen and the reaction mixture is heated at a first temperature range of about 120Â°C to about 130Â°C for 30 minutes to remove water from the reaction components. The reaction mixture is then subsequently heated to a range of about 140Â°C to about 15GÂ°C to start the esterification reaction.   Mild vacuum (500-550 mm Hg) is<br><br>
applied during the esterification reaction to assist in removal of water and the reaction mixture is continually heated until the distilling over of water ceases. The vacuum can be adjusted during the reaction to prevent carboxylic acid fi"om distilling over. After esterification is complete, the residual alkyl-substituted isethionic acid present as a catalyst may be neutralized with an alkali such as caustic, amine, ammonia or substituted ammonium compounds such as mono-, di-, and triamines, and alkanolamine such as ethanolamine. The excess fatty acid can be conveniently removed by vacuum distillation at temperatures and pressures varying from about 100Â° and about 250Â°C and between about 1 and about 200 mm Hg to make the product substantially fatty acid free.<br>
The acyl alkylisethionate esters according to the present invention produced from alkyl-substituted isethionates are much more hydrolytically stable than acyl isethionate esters produced from non-alkyl-substituted isethionates, such as SI.<br>
Thus, it has been surprisingly found that by substituting hydrogen with Ci to Cs alkyl groups on one or both of the carbon atoms of the ethane sulfonate portion of an acyl alkylisethionate ester, hydrol&gt;'tic stability and water solubility of the acyl alkylisethionate ester is dramatically improved. That is by providing a C| to Ce on one or both of the carbon atoms of the isethionic acid (or isethionate salt) raw material used in producing the acylethylisethionate ester, the water solubility and hydrolytic stability of the modified ester is improved. This result is wholly unexpected in view of the common knowledge in the art that increasing the hydrocarbon character of a material generally results in a reduction of water solubility. As a result of this improved solubility and hydrolytic stability, the acyl alkylisethionates of the present invention are suitable for use in liquid personal care cleaners and not limited to soap bars.<br>
In one embodiment of the reaction processes described herein, using the respective reactants herein, allow for the formation of acyl alkylisethionate ester compositions having both acyl isethionate esters and acyl alkylisethionate esters. For example, an acyl alkylisethionate ester composition may include of sodium cocoyl alkylisethionate isomeric esters (SCAl) and sodium cocoyl isethionates esters (SCI) from a blend of sodium isethionate (SI) and sodium alkylisethionate isomeric mixture (SAI).    The blend  of acyl  isethionate esters and acyl<br><br>
alkylisethionate esters in a composition have been observed to have lowered the melt temperatures of ester products and the ester products remain liquid at considerably lower temperatures than individual esters. In addition, it has also been observed that blend of acyl isethionate esters and acyl alkylisethionate esters provide improved homogeneity of the mixture at lower temperature with decreased reaction times during the esterification process.<br>
Additionally, the blending of isethionates and alkyl-substituted isethionates prior to the esterification process has been observed to result in a composition having water soluble isethionate esters. For example, the blending of water insoluble sodium cocoyl isethionates with sodium cocyl alkylisethionates has been observed to result in a composition having water soluble sodium cocyl isethionates. Additionally, this blending enhanced not only the solubility but also the processability of the isethionate esters by lowering the melt temperatures of the reactants which allows for lowering the reaction temperatures. -A-dditionally, the reaction mass is more homogeneous at a lower temperature due to the lower melt temperatures of the reactants, the reaction is faster and the esterification is far more complete than single ester processes. Thus, the blending of the respective isethionates improves the economics of the esterification process and ester products compared to the process and products in manufacturing pure component esters blending for formulation purposes.<br>
For example, a blend of sodium isethionate (SI) with sodium alkylisethionates, particularly, sodium methyl and ethyl isethionates separately or mixtures was reacted with fatty acids (carboxylic acids) using a catalyst such as zinc oxide at between about 200**C and about 225"C. The reaction was observed to have a much higher ester formation at lower temperatures between about 200Â°C and about .225'C compared to between about 240Â°C and about 250Â°C with the esters remaining liquids at lower temperatures without product degradation. It was also observed that the blends prevented the solids formation during the addition of isethionate solution to fatty acid at temperatures below 150Â°C and reduced the amount of fatty acid distilled over into water layer during the esterification process. Also, the reaction time was observed to be reduced by 25% and at most 50% compared to single sodium alkylisethionates reactions.<br><br>
It is believed that varying the level of each of the isethionate and alkylisethionate component for the esterification, can produce ester products with a desired water solubility. For example, by increasing the level of sodium methyl isethionate or sodium ethyl isethionate in a composition having sodium isethionate, the solubility of the resulting ester was observed to improve from almost no solubility of the sodium isethionate ester to almost 30% solubility when sodium isethionate ester is mixed with either sodium methyl isethionate or sodium ethyl isethionate esters. More specifically, a composition of sodium cocoyl methyl isethionate (SCMI) and sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) resulted in water soluble isethionate esters when compared to water insoluble sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI). The blending of sodium isethionate (SI) and sodium alkylisethionates (SAI) (especially, sodium methyl isethionate (P-salt), sodium ethyl isethionate, (B-salt) and reacting with fatty acids produced esters having improved water solubility compared to SCI from sodium isethionate. The ability to control the physical properties of the ester products, such as solubility, would allow for the manufacturing of tailor esters to suit customer needs.<br>
Thus, the blend of esters as d-sscribed herein gave une}:pected or surprising results by improving solubility of isethionate esters, the alkylisethionate esters blends are milder than single component isethionates including SCI as shown in (Example 29 and Table 3 herein), the alkylisethionate esters blends have a lower melting point than single component esters, the blend of reactants to form the alkylisethionate esters blends have lower esterification reaction temperatures and shorter esterification reaction times with less product degradation.<br>

Again, the results of this foam test show that foaming can be significantly increased when using a stripped coco fatty acid feed SCMl instead of whole coco fatty acid. The C\2 to C|8 SCMI flash foam height, as well as the stability at 10 minutes, were better than SLES alone and were similar to SLES/betaine performance. Furthermore, the C12 to Cig SCMl was again synergistic with CAPB as shown by the results for Samples 4 and 5 when 25% and 18% by weight of SCMI was replaced with CAPB. Thus, SCMl can be used with other surfactants and still maintain or improve excellent foaming properties.<br>
Finally, as shown in Figures lA and IB, the foam appearance of SCMI was tighter and creamier than SLES or SLS based cleansers making the use of SCMI in personal care cleansers highly desirable. All samples shown in Figures lA and IB were at 0.5% active of surfactant.<br>
