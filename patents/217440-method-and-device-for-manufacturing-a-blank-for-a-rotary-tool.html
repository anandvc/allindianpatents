The field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for manufacturing a blank for<br>
a tool as well as a tool made by the method according to the preambles of the independent<br>
claims.<br>
Prior art<br>
It is previously known through for example WO 98/28455 to press material powder,<br>
such as tungsten carbide (WC) together with cobalt (Co), between a punch and a die, and<br>
subsequently to sinter the material such that the binder metal is melted and binds the<br>
carbides to form tool material for chip removing machining. The known technique brings<br>
about a plurality of drawbacks. The powder give off dust and the formed green body<br>
(pressed but not sintered material) will not endure handling to any degree. Furthermore the<br>
chip flutes must be ground and the method requires time and energy. The problems have<br>
partly been solved by injection moulding of cemented carbide mixed in a carrier such as<br>
indicated in SE-B-9501687-9. The method of injection moulding brings a high degree of<br>
freedom concerning geometry but brings costly investments in moulds.<br>
It is previously known through for example US 4,779,440 and WO/0074870 to form<br>
a blank for a helix drill. The extruded blank has chip flutes with uniform pitch along the<br>
circumference of the blank. At tests with elastic threads such as in US-A-5,438,858 the<br>
spaces formed obtained poor position tolerances. This means that these spaces endanger to<br>
encroach on chip flutes and cutting edge areas.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a method and a device, whereby<br>
varying pitch of the flush channels can be obtained.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method and a device, whereby<br>
the lengths and pitch of the chip flutes can be decided.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a tool with varying pitch.<br>
2<br><br>
These and other objects have been achieved by a method and a device for<br>
manufacturing a tool as well as a tool made by the method such as they are defined in the<br>
appended claims with reference to the drawings.<br>

Detailed description of preferred embodiments<br>
The embodiment of a tool according to invention shown in Figs. 1 A-IE is a so-<br>
called helix drill. The drill 10 is made in solid hard material, such as for example extruded<br>
cemented carbide, and includes helical chip flutes 18 and these can extend through the<br>
entire body or through a part thereof. The drill has a shank 11 to be secured to a rotary<br>
spindle, not shown. The drill has two upper clearance surfaces 15. All surfaces and<br>
3<br><br>
associated edges are made from the same material, i.e. preferably in extruded cemented<br>
carbide. Lines of intersection of the chip flutes 18 and the clearance surfaces 15 form main<br>
cutting edges 19 at the cutting end of the drill, preferably via reinforcing chamfers 12. The<br>
entire length of the drill is chosen from 3 to 10 times its diameter. Two flush channels 14<br>
extend through the entire drill to transfer flushing medium from the spindle to the tip of<br>
the drill. A diametrical groove can be provided at the shank end to inter alia counteract<br>
obstruction of the holes. Both the flushing channels 14 and the chip flutes 18 have varying<br>
pitch. The variation of the pitch of the, for example two, flushing channels 14 are<br>
preferably substantially identical. The variation of the pitch of the, for example two, chip<br>
flutes 18 are preferably substantially identical. The variation of the pitch of the flushing<br>
channels 14 and of the chip flutes 18 are preferably substantially identical. The pitch is<br>
such that the axial angle al relative to the center line CL of the drill is bigger at its cutting<br>
end 16 than the axial angle a2 at the mid of the chip flutes in the axial direction of the<br>
drill. For example the axial angle can vary between 5 and 20° from its cutting end 16 to the<br>
axially inner end 17 of the chip flute. This drill can be made via one of at least four<br>
different methods. The unit "mm/revolution" defines the pitch. The pitch p is<br>
proportionally inverted relative to the axial angle a according to this formula:<br>
D*7i/tana = p,<br>
where D is the diameter of the drill in millimeter, and p is the pitch in millimeter.<br>
Example: A drill with D 10 mm and a 30° axial angle in a radial cross section gives the<br>
pitch 10 * 3,14 / tan(30°) = 54,4 mm.<br>
The axial angle for the axially forward part of the drill lies within the interval of 20°-<br>
45° and the rear part of the drill between 5° and 25°. The drill in the shown embodiment<br>
has 31° at the cutting end 16 and 16° at the axially inner end 17. By providing the axial<br>
angles according to the described geometry low cutting forces are obtained at drilling<br>
through the relatively large rake angle at the end 16 as well as an efficient chip flow by<br>
means of a relatively small axial angle at axially rearwardly along the chip flutes. In<br>
addition, the varying pitch of the flushing channels 14 in the drill 10 implies that the exits<br>
of the channels can be placed where they give most effect for the drilling process without<br>
influencing the area of for example grinding of chip flutes.<br>
4<br><br>
In Figs. 2A-2C an embodiment of a device 20 according to the present invention for<br>
generation of elongated cylindrical green bodies is shown. With the term "green body" is<br>
here meant an extruded but not sintered body, while the term "blank" relates to a sintered<br>
body. It should be noted that the term "green" does not relate to the colour of the body but<br>
relates to an extrudate. The device 20 comprises a rectangular housing 21 of steel, which is<br>
intended to be fastened with for instance bolts to a machine for extrusion, not shown. The<br>
housing 21 has two bolts 22 to be fastened in the machine and has a rear surface 23<br>
intended to seal against said machine. The housing has a central through-going recess 24<br>
through which a mixture will be pressed. The recess 24 is widened in connection to the<br>
rear surface 23 to form spaces 25, 26 for feed worm ends, Fig. 3. The recess 24 transforms<br>
into a diameter reducing restriction 27 in a circular nozzle 28. The nozzle 28 is made from<br>
a wear resistant material such as cemented carbide. The recess 24 then continues via a<br>
cylindrical inner, centrally positioned hole 30 into a circular die 29, which is provided next<br>
to and in connection with the nozzle 28. The die 29 is substantially cylindrical and<br>
comprises a radially external flange 31, which is intended to cooperate with axial bearings<br>
32 in a lid 36. The external end of the die 29 is provided with a rotational device or a<br>
pinion 50, which is rigid with the die. The pinion is intended to be operated by a cog-<br>
wheel, not shown. The die can thereby be rotated a infinite number of revolutions together<br>
with the pinion 50. The principal feed direction of the mixture is depicted by F. A bar-<br>
shaped core 33 is recessed into the die. The core is rectangular and contains two elongate<br>
rigid pins 35. The pins can be made from steel. The pins 35 are intended to project from<br>
the core in the feed direction F to form flush channels in the green body. The recess 24<br>
ends in an open hole in the outer end of the die. The device according to the present<br>
invention consequently comprises a rigid part 28 and a rotatable part 29.<br>
The drill or the end mill is manufactured as follows. Hard metal powder having a<br>
certain cobalt content and a carrier, for example a polymer or a plastic, is mixed and<br>
shaped to pellets or granulates. The content of binder lies within the interval of 1-10<br>
percent by weight. The expression "cobalt" shall here be understood as a metallic binder<br>
that alternatively can be exchanged for or include other metals, for example nickel, Ni.<br>
Subsequently the mixture is preheated to a temperature suitable for the mixture and is<br>
5<br><br>
inserted in a machine for extrusion. Then the mixture is pressed at certain pressure and<br>
certain temperature, about 180 °C, that is considerably lower than at prior art where the<br>
melting temperature of cobalt is required, into the recess 24 by means of the two feed<br>
worms, said restriction 27 will further compress the mixture or mass. Then the hot mixture<br>
reaches the core 33 and passes this on each side through the two substantially semi-circular<br>
openings formed about the core. Rearwardly of the core in the feed direction F the mixture<br>
fuses again to a cylindrical body except from where the pins 35 form spaces in the body,<br>
which later will constitute flush channels. The pins are chosen long enough to allow the<br>
mixture to cool such that fusion is avoided. The pins 35 do not reach the rotatable part 29,<br>
i.e. the rigid pins 35 are provided axially distant from the rotatable die 29. Subsequently<br>
the mixture reaches the space 30 and the mixture is brought to rotate by friction between<br>
the mixture and the bore wall. Thereby, a cylindrical green body is attained the channels of<br>
which having varying pitch. Then chip flutes are sintered and ground with substantially the<br>
same varying pitch as that of the flushing channels.<br>
Thus, at extrusion of the green body the mixture is fed into the device that comprises<br>
a rigid and a rotatable part. By first being able to shape a green body with flushing holes<br>
and then twist it in one and the same device has definitive advantages. A great advantage<br>
with this technique is that green bodies can be extruded with both straight and twisted<br>
flushing holes in one and the same device, which gives better economy. Another advantage<br>
with this technique is however that a compact solution for the manufacture of twisted<br>
green bodies is attained. Thereby bulky and expensive equipment is avoided that otherwise<br>
would be required for gripping the green body from the outside and then twisting it. The<br>
finished green body consequently has been extruded and has obtained entirely or partly<br>
twisted flushing holes that also may have varying pitch. The shaping that is plastic, occurs<br>
with the aid of a tool that comprises a rigid and a rotatable part. The mixture is fed into in<br>
the rigid part of the tool where it is compressed around a fixed core in order to be shaped<br>
to a green body with flushing holes. In the next moment the mixture is further fed into in<br>
the rotatable part of the tool the driving of which is synchronized with the control system<br>
of the machine. The rotatable part has a die that compresses the mixture further and the<br>
friction between the mixture and the wall of the hole 30 forces the green body to be<br>
6<br><br>
twisted. The rotational speed of the die thereby influences the pitch of the flushing holes,<br>
which means that green bodies with flushing holes that have varying pitch can be extruded.<br>
The greatest advantage with this technique is that one in a very simple manner can<br>
influence the pitch of the flushing holes by changing the rotational speed of the die. The<br>
varying pitch is attained by changing the rotational speed of the die under controlled<br>
conditions during the process. Also the chip flutes must be created by grinding with<br>
corresponding pitch at a blank with chip flutes having varying pitch. With regard to<br>
drilling in certain materials a drill which has chip flutes of varying pitch can be a better<br>
product.<br>
In Figs. 4A-4D is shown an alternative embodiment of a device 20' according to the<br>
present invention for manufacture of elongated green bodies with external grooves such as<br>
is shown in Fig. 3. What differs this device 20' from the device 20 is foremost that the<br>
device 20' comprises a portion 42 provided on level with the ends of the pins 35, which<br>
portion comprises two movable parts 40, 41 that project radially into the recess 24 between<br>
the nozzle 28 and the die 29 in order to emboss chip flutes in the green body. Each<br>
movable part 40, 41 comprises an inner rounded end. The end is symmetrically shaped and<br>
is provided on a bar. The bar runs in a hole in an intermediate part. A shoulder is provided<br>
on the bar in the vicinity of the end. The shoulder is intended to cooperate with a collar in<br>
the hole in order to obtain the correct projection into the space of the intermediate part. At<br>
extrusion of current green bodies the extrudate is fed into the device and passes in this case<br>
first cores 33, 35 that shape flushing holes. In the next phase the extrudate is compressed<br>
in order to again be homogenized after partition at the core. The extrudate now passes the<br>
part in device where the plastic shaping of the chip flutes occur. Two cylindrical cores or<br>
movable parts 40, 41, each having one end shaped according to the desired chip flute<br>
profile, are assembled at suitable partition, for example 180°, in the device. Said one end is<br>
preferably rounded. The cores bottom in the device at full chip flute depth and are coupled<br>
to suitable control and automatic engineering, not shown, outside of the device. After<br>
reaching the desired chip flute length the cores are pulled back and the extrudate reverts to<br>
the roundness that is necessary to shape the drill shank. After formation of the chip flutes<br>
the extrudate is pressed further into a rotatable part of the device, which through friction<br>
7<br><br>
twists the extrudate and then also the chip flutes. The rotational speed determines what<br>
pitch the chip flutes get. It also becomes possible to combine straight and twisted chip<br>
flutes in one and the same blank that results in better products.<br>
In Figs. 5A-5D is shown an alternative embodiment of a device 20" according to the<br>
present invention for generation of elongated green bodies with external grooves such as is<br>
shown in Fig. 3. What differs this device 20" from the device 20' is foremost the two<br>
movable parts or jaws 40', 41' of the portion 42'. Each jaw 40', 41' comprises an inner end<br>
provided with a cutting edge. The profile of the cutting edge is the same as the desired chip<br>
flute profile. Each jaw has chip space of its own that runs from the center of the cutting<br>
insert, through the jaw, and out from the device. The profile of the cutting edge and the<br>
motion of the jaw make that the chip flute profile in the extrudate is changed in pace with<br>
the cutting depth. If desired also the cutting insert can be developed such that the profile of<br>
the chip flute does not vary with the cutting depth. This means that green bodies with<br>
varying chip flute depth and profile can be extruded, which results in improved products.<br>
Furthermore, optimal ends of the chip spaces can be obtained which is not always the case<br>
with the device 20'. The extrudate gives in this situation green bodies with straight chip<br>
flutes and flushing holes. In the last phase of the device the extrudate is finely calibrated<br>
and is pressed further into a rotatable die 29 that twists chip flutes and flushing holes to<br>
desired pitch.<br>
In Figs. 6A-6D is shown an alternative embodiment of a device 20'" according to the<br>
present invention for generation of elongated green bodies with external grooves such as is<br>
shown in Fig. 3. What differs this device 20" from the device 20' is foremost the two<br>
movable parts or cutting inserts 40", 41" of the portion 42". Each cutting insert 40", 41"<br>
comprises an inner end provided with a cutting edge. Two cutting inserts, or more, at<br>
suitable partition are assembled on shafts which makes them possible to pivot. The shafts<br>
terminate on the upper side of the tool and is coupled to suitable control and automatic<br>
engineering. The noses of the cutting inserts have the desired chip flute profile at a 45°<br>
angle, relative to the center line CL1 of the recess, and when the extrudate passes the<br>
cutting inserts material is machined and chip flutes are formed. Machined material leaves<br>
the device by means of the chip flutes of the tool. The lower side of each cutting insert has<br>
8<br><br>
the same radius as the green body, which makes when the cutting inserts pivot back that<br>
the device seals tightly as if no cutting insert was present. With the cutting inserts in this<br>
position the shaping of the chip flutes ceases and the extrudate surpasses to the roundness<br>
that is necessary to shape drill shanks. The combination with the extrudate being machined<br>
in a hot condition close to the creation of the green body and the material being machined<br>
instead of being deformed when chip flutes are formed, results in better products.<br>
When the green body comes out from the jaws it cools quickly due the surrounding<br>
temperature and the green body continues to extrude until the chip flute part is sufficiently<br>
long. The length of the green body is determined by how long the extrusion is continued.<br>
The solidified green body can then be cut or simply be broken, for example by hand, in<br>
suitable lengths in interval of 5-10 times its diameter.<br>
When the green body has been removed from the extrusion machine it is heated in a<br>
separate furnace such that the carrier is burned off and such that the binder metal melts and<br>
binds the carbides, such that a blank is formed. Then further machining of the blank takes<br>
place, such as for example grinding of edge portions, shank portion and clearance surfaces.<br>
With the present method and device a tool can be produce whereby varying pitch can<br>
be obtained both for flush channels and chip flutes. The mixture is allowed pass a rotatable<br>
part 29 after the formation of the spaces in the green body. This means that the method<br>
according to the present invention creates the spaces before rotation is made. The<br>
advantage therefrom in both the method and the device according to the present invention<br>
is that economically advantageous modular structural design can be utilized since the<br>
portions 42, 42' and 42" easily can be mounted without interference from the rigid pins 35.<br>
The invention is in no way limited to the above described embodiments but can be<br>
varied freely within the scope of the appended claims. Thus the invention can be used also<br>
for solid end mills. The tool can be coated with layers of for example AI2O3, TiN and/or<br>
TiCN.<br>
