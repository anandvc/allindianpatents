				<td>The present invention relates to an audible pilot winker apparatus. The audible pilot winker apparatus permits a rider to check turning on and off of a winker lamp. [0002] [Prior Art]<br>
A conventional audible pilot winker apparatus is disclosed, for example, in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 5227/82, which is provided in the interior of a relay device with an oscillator, relay coils, an armature integral with a relay switch, and a diaphragm, and wherein the relay coils are energized intermittently with an output of the oscillator, a winker lamp is turned on and off through a winker switch by means of an armature and a relay switch both responding to the magnetic force of the relay coils, and the diaphragm is struck by an elastic action of the armature to generate an alarm sound. [0003]<br>
There also is known a conventional audible pilot winker apparatus which is provided in the interior of a relay device with a capacitor, relay coils and an armature integral with a relay switch and wherein the relay coils are energized intermittently by utilizing the charge and discharge function of capacitor, a winker lamp isturned on and off through a winker switch by means of the armature and the relay switch both responding to the magnetic force of the relay coils, and a cover of the relay device is struck by an elastic action of the armature to generate a ticking sound.<br>
problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, the audible pilot winker apparatus disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No.5227/82 involves the problem that the relay device is expensive because it is provided with an oscillator in the interior thereof.<br>
In the conventional winker with an audible pilot which utilizes the charge and discharge function of the capacitor and wherein the armature is attracted during charging of the capacitor and is deenergized to generate a ticking sound upon completion of the capacitor charging, if the turn indictor switch is turned off during charging of the capacitor, the armature is deenergized and generates a ticking sound at that instant, then the relay coils are again energized to attract the armature by the discharging current from the capacitor. With decrease of the discharging current, the attracting force becomes weaker<br>
gradually, and upon return of the armature by virtue of its elastic action, the armature again strikes the cover of the relay device to generate a ticking sound despite the winker lamp is off, thus affording an indicating function having a sense of incongruity. [0006]<br>
The present invention has been accomplished for solving the above-mentioned problems of the prior art and it is an object of the invention to provide an audible pilot winker apparatus which is small in size and inexpensive and which is provided in the interior of a relay device with a capacitor, relay coils and a relay switch, further provided with a tick generation shortening means connected in parallel with both terminals of the relay device to shorten the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning off a winker switch, thereby eliminating the sense of incongruity in the indicating function. [0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an audible pilot winker apparatus, comprising a relay device with audible pilot, said relay device having a capacitor and a ticking iron piece, winker lamps, a winker switch, and a pilot lamp used for a rider to check the operation of said winker switch, and wherein, by means of said ticking iron piece, said winker lamp are turned on and of selectively through said winker switch and a cover of said relay means having an audible pilot is struck to generate a ticking sound, the improvement characterized by farther comprising a tick generation shortening means connected in parallel with both terminals of said relay device having an audible pilot to shorten the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning off said winker switch.<br>
Since the audible pilot winker apparatus according to the present invention includes the tick generation shortening means connected in parallel with both terminals of a relay device with audible pilot to shorten the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning off a winker switch, it is possible to eliminate the sense of incongruity in the indicating function. [0009]<br>
The audible pilot winker apparatus according to the present invention is also characterized in that a pilot lamp used for a rider to check the operation of the winker switch is used as the tick generation shortening means. [0010]<br>
Consequently, it is possible to reduce the number of parts used. [0011] [Embodiment of the Invention]<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will be described hereinunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
[Brief Description of the Drawings]<br>
Fig.l is an electric circuit diagram of an audible pilot winker apparatus according to the present invention;<br>
Fig.2 is a diagram explaining the operation of the winker; and<br>
Fig.3 is a sectional view of a relay device 2 with audible pilot.<br>
Fig.l is an electric circuit diagram of an audible pilot winker apparatus embodying the present invention.<br>
In Fig.l, the audible pilot winker apparatus, indicated at 1, comprises a relay device 2 with audible pilot, a pilot lamp 7 serving as a tick generation shortening means, a winker switch 4, and winker lamps (5,6).<br>
The relay device 2 with audible pilot is provided in the interior thereof with relay coils (A,B), a relay switch S2, a capacitor Cl, and a discharging resistor Rl.<br>
Fig.2 is a diagram explaining the operation of the audible pilot winker apparatus.<br>
Fig.2 shows how the state changes with time with respect to (1) winker switch 4, (2) capacitor charging/ discharging currents, (3) relay switch S2, (4) pilot lamp 7, (5) current Is in the winker lamp, (6) winker lamps (5,6) and (7) ticking sound, in the winker 1 with audible pilot.<br>
With reference to Figs.1 and 2, the following description is now provided about the indicating function of the winker 1 with audible pilot. [0013]<br>
The winker 1 with audible pilot starts operation<br>
the instant the winker switch 4 changes over from OFF to ON.<br>
When a terminal C of the winker switch 4 is connected to a terminal L or a terminal R, there is formed through a key switch S1 a closed circuit comprising a vehicular power supply VB, the relay device 2 with audible pilot and winker lamps (5,6).<br>
Time tl in Fig.2(l) represents the instant of change-over from OFF to ON of the winker switch 4. [0014]<br>
At the instant (tl) of change-over from OFF to ON of the winker switch 4 there flows an exciting current in the relay coil A to energize the relay coil, and a ticking iron piece 12 (Fig.3) to be described later is attracted to turn the relay switch S2 from ON to OFF.<br>
Upon turning OFF of the relay switch S2, there flows a charging current Ic in the capacitor Cl to energize both relay coils A and B, and the relay switch S2 is kept OFF with a magnetic force created in both relay coils A and B.<br>
While the relay switch S2 is OFF, a discharging current Idl flows in a closed circuit comprising the capacitor Cl, relay coils A,B and the pilot lamp 7 connected in parallel with terminals Tl and T2 of the relay<br>
device 2 with audible pilot, to turn ON the pilot lamp 7.<br>
With the relay switch S2 OFF, the states of charging current Ic, pilot lamp 7, winker lamp current Is, winker lamp 5 and ticking sound are shown with times (tl-t2) in Fig.2.<br>
The charging current Ic decreases with an increase in the amount of charge which has been stored in the capacitor Cl by the charging current Ic.<br>
As the charging current Ic decreases, the<br>
attractive force based on the magnetism of both relay coils A and B becomes weaker, so that the ticking iron piece 12 (Fig.3) to be described later strikes a cover of the relay device 2 by virtue of its elastic force to generate a ticking sound.<br>
Time t2 in Fig.2(3) represents the instant of change-over from OFF to ON of the relay switch S2.<br>
Upon change-over from OFF to ON of the relay switch S2 there is formed a closed circuit comprising the vehicular power supply VB, relay coil A, relay switch S2, winker switch 4 and winker lamp 5, and a winker lamp current Is flows in the winker lamp 5 to turn ON the winker<br><br>
lamp 5. [0019]<br>
When the relay switch S2 changes over from OFF to ON, there is formed a closed circuit comprising the capacitor Cl, relay coil B and relay switch S2, and a discharging current Id flows through the relay coil B in a direction to prevent energization of the relay coil A by the winker lamp current Is, whereby the relay switch S2 is held ON.<br>
While the relay switch S2 is held ON, the pilot lamp 7 goes on and off. [0020]<br>
With the relay switch S2 ON, the states of discharging current Id, pilot lamp 7, winker lamp current Is, winker lamp 5 and ticking are shown with times (t2-t3) in Fig.2. [0021]<br>
The discharging current Id decreases with a decrease in the amount of charge stored in the capacitor Cl.<br>
When the discharging current Id decreases in a direction to prevent energization of the relay coil A by the winker lamp current Is, the relay coil A is energized, so that the ticking iron piece 12 (Fig.3) to be described<br>
later is again attracted and the relay switch S2 is thereby<br>
changed over from ON to OFF.<br>
[0022]<br>
Upon change-over from ON to OFF of the relay switch S2, the charging current Ic again flows in the capacitor Cl to energize both relay coils A and B, so that the relay switch S2 is kept OFF with a magnetic force developed in both coils.<br>
While the relay switch S2 is held OFF, the pilot lamp 7 goes ON, the winker lamp 5 goes OFF, and the ticking sound is extinguished. [0023]<br>
With the relay switch S2 OFF, the states of the charging current Ic, pilot lamp 7, winker lamp current Is, winker lamp 5 and ticking are shown with times (t3-t4) in Fig.2. [0024]<br>
ON/OFF of the relay switch S2 and charging and discharging of the capacitor Cl are repeated until turning OFF of the winker switch 4, whereby the winker lamp (5 or 6) and the pilot lamp 7 are turned ON and OFF and a ticking sound is generated in synchronism with turning ON and OFF of the winker lamp (5 or 6) or the pilot lamp 7. [0025]<br>
With the relay switch S2 OFF and at the instant of change-over from ON to OFF of the winker switch 4 during charging of the capacitor Cl by the charging current Ic, as shown at time t6 in Fig.2, the relay coils (A,B) are deenergized and the ticking iron piece 12 strikes the cover of the relay device 2 with audible pilot by virtue of its elastic force to generate a ticking sound. At the same time, the relay switch S2 turns ON. [0026]<br>
As a result, the relay coil B is again energized by the discharging current Id from the capacitor Cl and attracts the sticking iron piece 12 (Fig.3), thus causing the relay switch S2 to turn OFF.<br>
Once the relay switch S2 turns OFF, the relay coils (A,B) are energized by both the charging current Idr flowing in the closed circuit comprising the capacitor Cl, relay coils B,A and resistor Rl and the discharging current Idl flowing in the closed circuit comprising the capacitor Cl, relay coils B,A and pilot lamp 7, to keep OFF the relay switch S2. [0027]<br>
With a decrease of the discharging currents (Idr, Idl) flowing in the relay coils (A,B), the attractive force of the ticking iron piece 12 induced by the relay coils<br>
(A,B) becomes weaker, and upon return of the ticking iron piece 12 by virtue of its elastic action, the ticking iron piece again strikes the cover (Fig.3) of the relay device 2 with audible pilot to generate a ticking sound despite turning OFF of the winker lamp. [0028]<br>
As a result, the relay coils A and B are energized by the discharging currents (Idr + Idl) to continue attracting the ticking iron piece 12 (Fig.3), thereby keeping OFF the relay switch S2. [0029]<br>
At this time, the pilot lamp 7, the winker lamp current Is, winker lamp 5 and ticking are in such states as shown at times t6 and t7 in Fig.2. [0030]<br>
If the discharging current based on the amount of charge stored in the capacitor Cl after turning OFF of the winker switch 4 is only the discharging current Idr flowing in the discharging resistor Rl, the discharging time becomes long, so that the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning OFF the winker switch 4 becomes long, as shown at time t8 in Fig.2. [0031]<br>
On the other hand, if the discharging current based<br>
on the amount of charge stored in the capacitor Cl after turning OFF the winker switch 4 comprises the discharging currents (Idr + Idl) flowing in both discharging resistor Rl and pilot lamp 7, then as shown at time t7 in Fig.2, it is possible to shorten the discharging time and thereby shorten the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning OFF the winker switch 4.<br>
Thus, in the winker 1 with audible pilot according to the present invention, the pilot lamp 7 is connected in parallel with both terminals Tl and T2 of the relay device 2 with audible pilot to shorten the discharging time based on the amount of charge stored in the capacitor cl after turning OFF the winker switch 4, whereby the time until the generation of a ticking sound after turning OFF of the winker switch 4 can be made short. Therefore, the sense of incongruity in the indicating function can be eliminated.<br>
Fig.3 is a sectional view of the relay device 2 with audible pilot.<br>
In Fig.3, the relay device 2 comprises a case 10, a base 11, the ticking iron piece 12, a cover 13, constituents of the relay switch S2 which are a contact moving piece 14, a movable contact 15 and a fixed contact<br>
16, the relay coils A,B, resistor Rl and capacitor Cl.<br>
The movable contact 15 is attached to the front end portion of the contact moving piece 14, while the fixed contact 16 is located at a position opposed to the movable contact 15.<br>
In an inoperative state of the ticking iron piece 12, the movable contact 15 is in abutment with the fixed contact 16 and the relay switch S2 is ON.<br>
Further, in an inoperative state of the ticking iron piece 12, the front end portion of the ticking iron piece 12 is in abutment with the cover 13.<br>
When the relay coils A and B are energized intermittently, the ticking iron piece 12 is operated by an intermittent attractive force based on the magnetism developed in both coils.<br>
The ticking iron piece 12 is attracted by the magnetism developed the relay coils A and B and acts on the relay switch S2 to turn it OFF.<br>
Next, when both coils A and B are deenergized, the icking iron piece 12 returns to its unattracted position by virtue of its elastic force, thereby striking the cover<br>
13 to generate a ticking sound. At the same time, the ticking iron piece 12 no longer acts on the relay switch S2, allowing the switch S2 to turn ON.<br>
The above is one embodiment of the present invention and the invention is not limited thereto.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
With the above construction, the present invention exhibits the following effects.<br>
Since the audible pilot winker apparatus according to the present invention is provided wiht a tick generation shortening means connected in parallel with both terminals of a relay device having an audible pilot to shorten the time until generation of a ticking sound after turning OFF the winker switch, it is possible to eliminate the sense of incongruity associated with the indicating function, and hence the commercial value of the winker can be improved.<br>
In the audible pilot winker apparatus according to the present invention, moreover, since the pilot lamp used for a rider to check the operation of the winker switch is used as the tick generation shortening means, it is possible to reduce the number of parts used, and hence the size and cost of the winker can be reduced.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention can afford an economical audible pilot winker apparatus of a high commercial value.<br>
