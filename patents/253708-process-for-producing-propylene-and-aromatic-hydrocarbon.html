				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING PROPYLENE AND AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS,<br>
AND PRODUCING APARATUS THEREFOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for producing propylene and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons by catalytic conversion and catalytic cyclization from a<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock, and to a producing apparatus therefor.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Thermal cracking has been widely used for obtaining propylene and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons from hydrocarbon feedstock, but by its very nature thermal<br>
decomposition requires severe reaction conditions, and a common by-product is<br>
methane, which is difficult to use as petrochemical feedstock. Moreover, the product<br>
yields of propylene and other olefins and benzene, toluene and other aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons as percentages of the decomposition product are generally limited, and<br>
the yield structure is not sufficiently flexible among other problems.<br>
[00O3] Patent Document 1 discloses a method wherein silver is carried on<br>
crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite in order to improve selectivity for lower olefins.<br>
Although propylene yield is improved by this method, the yield of aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons is poor. Also, in methods for catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons<br>
using zeolite, coke accumulates on the catalyst and must be frequently removed by<br>
combustion to regenerate the catalyst, but the problem is that in the case of the acid<br>
zeolite described above, repeated regeneration operations cause permanent<br>
degradation of catalyst activity. This occurs because coke combustion generates<br>
steam that hydrolyzes the zeolite, causing aluminum to be released from the zeolite<br>
crystals and eliminating protons that are active sites in the catalyst. This poses a<br><br>
serious problem that must be solved if proton-type zeolites are to be used in these<br>
kinds of reactions.<br>
[0004] Patent Document 2 discloses a proton-free zeolite catalyst along with a<br>
method for using this catalyst to convert hydrocarbon feedstock into ethylene,<br>
propylene and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The catalyst used in this method<br>
has the advantage of being resistant to regeneration degradation, but is still<br>
vulnerable to the problem of coking deterioration. Moreover, because the<br>
aforementioned paraffin conversion reaction is an endothermic reaction, a large<br>
amount of heat must be supplied to the reaction vessel. As a result, this method<br>
requires a complex and expensive reaction system.<br>
[0005] An effective means of increasing the flexibility of the propylene / aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon yield structure is to obtain these components by separate processes.<br>
However, the reaction technologies that have been used for each in the past need to<br>
be improved in order to obtain both components efficiently and stably.<br>
[0006] For the propylene production step, methods of catalytic conversion from<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock containing olefins using catalysts containing zeolite have<br>
been adopted, and there are many reports of methods for producing propylene from<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock containing olefins by catalytic conversion using catalysts<br>
containing zeolite. However, efficient, long-term and stable production of propylene<br>
from hydrocarbon feedstock containing olefins by catalytic conversion using a<br>
catalyst containing zeolite is difficult for the following reasons.<br>
[0007] Propylene is an intermediate in reactions for converting olefins into<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons in the presence of a zeolite catalyst, and is converted into<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons by the subsequent reaction. Consequently, when attempting<br>
to produce propylene by catalytic conversion of hydrocarbon feedstock containing<br>
olefins using a catalyst containing zeolite, the catalyst activity and reaction conditions<br><br>
need to be strictly controlled in order to obtain the desired product with a high yield.<br>
That is, if the catalyst is too active or the contact time is too long, the resulting<br>
propylene will be converted to aromatic hydrocarbons by the subsequent reaction.<br>
Conversely, if the catalyst is not active enough or the contact time is too short, the<br>
propylene yield will be poor. Because olefins are highly reactive, however,<br>
deposition of coke on the surface of the catalyst is likely to occur during catalytic<br>
conversion of the hydrocarbon feedstock containing olefins using the catalyst<br>
containing zeolite. In continuous conversion reactions, the catalyst deteriorates due<br>
to coking (coking deterioration), and catalytic activity quickly declines. Regeneration<br>
operations are required as described above in order to reactivate the catalyst, but<br>
after repeated regeneration operations catalytic activity can no longer be adequately<br>
restored.<br>
[0008] As discussed above, coking is particularly likely in catalytic conversion<br>
reactions of the hydrocarbon feedstock containing olefins using catalysts containing<br>
zeolite, and regeneration degradation is also extremely likely because of the<br>
consequent need for frequent regeneration operations.<br>
[0009] Patent Document 3 discloses a method for converting C4-12 olefins into<br>
ethylene and propylene using a proton-free ZSM-5 zeolite containing an IB group<br>
metal and having an SiO2 / Al2O3 ratio of from 200 to 5000. When a zeolite-<br>
containing catalyst is used to selectively convert C4-12 olefins to propylene, olefins<br>
with about 4 to 8 carbon atoms are produced as reaction products in addition to<br>
ethylene and propylene. This is because the raw material olefins are dimerized and<br>
decomposed by the catalyst, resulting in an olefin composition similar to the<br>
equilIbrium composition under the reaction conditions. Consequently, in order to<br>
efficiently convert the raw material olefins into propylene, the C4+ olefins in the<br><br>
reaction product need to be efficiently recycled back to the reaction container by a<br>
simple method, and converted to propylene.<br>
[0010] Patent Document 3 describes a method for removing the heavy fraction<br>
with a boiling point at or above that of the C8 aromatic hydrocarbons from the<br>
reaction product and recycling the C4-8 olefins back into the reaction vessel, but this<br>
method requires multiple separators to obtain the raw material for recycling, thereby<br>
complicating the equipment and operations, so there is a demand for simpler<br>
methods, but so far it has not been possible to achieve both efficiency (equipment,<br>
operating costs and yield) and stable production. Patent Document 3 also makes no<br>
mention of the effect on coking deterioration of the diolefin concentration in the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock. The higher the diolefin compound concentration in the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock, the more activity deteriorates due to coke production.<br>
Removal of diolefins from the feedstock is highly unpractical on an industrial scale<br>
because it requires that the feedstock be purified by pretreatment such as separation<br>
by distillation, partial hydrogenation or the like.<br>
[0011 ] For the aromatic hydrocarbon producing step, however, many methods<br>
are known for producing aromatic hydrocarbons using zeolite catalysts. As in the<br>
propylene producing step, the biggest problems with methods of producing aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons by catalytic cyclization using a zeolite catalyst are controlling coking<br>
deterioration during the reaction and controlling regeneration (permanent)<br>
degradation that occurs when the coke on the deteriorated catalyst is removed by<br>
combustion to regenerate the catalyst.<br>
[0012] Many proposals have been made in recent years for preventing both<br>
kinds of deterioration. Specifically, Patent Document 4 reports that coke precipitation<br>
during the reaction and permanent degradation due to dealumination during catalyst<br>
regeneration can be simultaneously controlled by using a high-silica zeolite catalyst<br><br>
of a specific particle size that exhibits a specific surface acid site / total acid site ratio<br>
and amounts of pyridine adsorption before and after steam treatment, or in other<br>
words specific changes in acid site behavior. In this method, however, the preferred<br>
method of synthesizing the zeolite is one using a seed slurry, which has low<br>
productivity, and moreover the stable production range of ZSM-5 zeolite is narrow,<br>
limiting the SiO2/ AI2O3 ratio so that the primary particles are likely to be relatively<br>
large. According to Patent Document 4, both coking deterioration and regeneration<br>
degradation are controlled, but because the zeolite particle size is relatively large, it<br>
does not appear that coking deterioration is adequately controlled. A zeolite with a<br>
smaller primary particle size would be preferable, but according to Patent Document<br>
4 this results in greater accumulation of coke during the reaction, and more rapid<br>
regeneration (permanent) degradation. These are serious obstacles to the industrial<br>
manufacture of aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
[0013] An example using a proton-free zeolite is given in Patent Document 2.<br>
The catalyst used in this method is effective at resisting regeneration degradation as<br>
described above, but the problem of coking deterioration remains. Consequently,<br>
coking deterioration is likely when the hydrocarbon feedstock contains large amounts<br>
of olefins. Moreover, this document makes no mentioned of the effect of the particle<br>
size of the zeolite used in the catalytic cyclization reaction.<br>

[0020] An aspect of a producing apparatus according to the present invention<br>
provides:<br><br>
[29] a producing apparatus for producing propylene and aromatic hydrocarbons from<br>
a hydrocarbon feedstock, comprising:<br>
(a)	a first reactor that receives the hydrocarbon feedstock and produces a<br>
reaction mixture containing propylene;<br>
(b)	a separator that receives the reaction mixture and is connected to the<br>

(c)	a second reactor connected to the separator, wherein the aromatic<br>

conduit for directly conducting a part of a separated product obtained from the<br>
separator to the first reactor and second reactor,<br>
[31] the producing apparatus according to item [29] or [30], wherein a part of a<br>

Advantageous Effects of the Invention<br>
[0021] According to the producing process of the present invention, propylene<br>
and aromatic hydrocarbons can be efficiently and stably produced from olefinic<br><br>
hydrocarbon feedstock, and the production ratios thereof can be easily varied as<br>
necessary.<br>
[0022] Further, the amount of at least one of C3-12 diolefin compound contained<br>
in the C4+ component produced in the propylene production reactor (which is the raw<br>
material in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step) is reduced below the amount<br>
of diolefin compounds in the hydrocarbon feedstock (which is the raw material in the<br>
propylene production step and contains 50 % by mass or more of at least one of C4-12<br>
olefin). Because they are highly reactive, diolefins are known to promote soiling of<br>
the equipment and coking of the catalyst surface, so by reducing the amount of<br>
diolefin compounds in the raw material for the aromatic hydrocarbon production step<br>
it is possible to achieve more stable continuous operation in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step.<br>
[0023] Furthermore, according to the producing apparatus of the present invention, propylene and aromatic hydrocarbons can be efficiently and stably<br>
produced from olefinic hydrocarbon feedstocks by using a simple apparatus and<br>
especially a single separator.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0024] Embodiments of the present invention are explained with reference to the<br>
drawings. The following embodiments are only examples for explaining the present<br>
invention, and the intent is not to limit the present invention only to these<br>
embodiments. The present invention can be implemented in a variety of modes as<br>
long as these do not depart from the spirits of the present invention.<br>
[0025] Figure 1 shows a schematic view of a producing apparatus according to<br>
one embodiment for implementing the producing process according to the present<br>
invention. Producing apparatus 1 according to the present invention comprises<br><br>
propylene production reactor' 12, which receives the hydrocarbon feedstock and is<br>
used to produce a reaction mixture containing propylene by catalytic conversion from<br>
the hydrocarbon feedstock, one separator 16 connected to propylene production<br>
reactor 12, which receives the aforementioned reaction mixture and is used to<br>
separate the reaction mixture into specific fractions and then isolate the propylene,<br>
and aromatic hydrocarbon production reactor 18, which receives a part of the specific<br>
fractions described above, is connected to separator 16 and is used to produce<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons by catalytic cyclization. Each reactor and separator is<br>
connected via conduit 20 as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, separator 16 is<br>
connected via a conduit which conducts the separated product obtained in separator<br>
16 directly to propylene production reactor 12 and aromatic hydrocarbon production<br>
reactor 18.<br>
[0026] Propylene production reactor 12 receives the hydrocarbon feedstock via<br>
heat exchanger 10, and a reaction mixture containing propylene is obtained by<br>
catalytic conversion inside reactor 12 by means of contact with the zeolite molded<br>
catalyst A described below. Note that this heat exchanger 10 can heat the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock being supplied to producing apparatus 1 according to the<br>
present invention using the heating value of the hydrocarbon fluid inside propylene<br>
production reactor 12. The reaction mixture containing propylene that is obtained in<br>
propylene production reactor 12 is compressed as necessary by compressor 14 and<br>
sent to separator 16.<br>
[0027] A part of the specific fractions separated in separator 16, and specifically<br>
a part of the fractions D or F2 described below, are preferably recycled back to<br>
propylene production reactor 12, contained in this reactor 12 and subjected to<br>
catalytic conversion. This recycling aspect is described below in the context of the<br>
propylene production step.<br><br>
[0028] In order for propylene to be efficiently produced in propylene production<br>
reactor 12, a value obtained by dividing an amount of component (% by mass) of the<br>
C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbons produced in the propylene production reactor by the<br>
hydrocarbon partial pressure [MPa] is preferably 13 or less, more preferably 10 or<br>
less.<br>
[0029] In separator 16, propylene is separated from the reaction mixture<br>
containing propylene that was obtained in propylene production reactor 12. Modes of<br>
separation may include, but are not limited to, a mode by which the reaction mixture<br>
is separated into fraction C containing mainly hydrogen and C1-3 hydrocarbons and<br>
fraction D containing mainly at least one of C4+ hydrocarbon, and propylene is<br>
isolated from fraction C, and a mode by which the reaction mixture is separated into<br>
fraction E containing mainly hydrogen and C1-2 hydrocarbons and fraction F<br>
containing mainly at least one of C3+ hydrocarbon, fraction F is separated into fraction<br>
F1 containing mainly C3 hydrocarbons and fraction F2 containing mainly at least one<br>
of C4+ hydrocarbon, and propylene is isolated from fraction F1. Specific examples of<br>
separator 16 may include a distilling column, a flash drum (gas-liquid separator) and<br>
the like, and a distilling column is preferred.<br>
[0O30] Aromatic hydrocarbon production reactor 18 is a reactor for producing<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons by catalytic cyclization, and aromatic hydrocarbons are<br>
produced as described below by contact with zeolite-containing molded catalyst B<br>
(described below) from all or a part of a specific fraction separated by this separator<br>
16, specifically fraction D or fraction F2.<br>
[0O31] Note that a fixed-bed reactor, moving-bed reactor, fluidized-bed reactor or<br>
stream transport system can be used for propylene production reactor 12 and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon production reactor 18, and an adiabatic fixed-bed reactor is<br>
preferred. Propylene production reactor 12 and aromatic hydrocarbon production<br><br>
reactor 18 are preferably made primarily of a metal material such as carbon steel or<br>
stainless steel.<br>
[0O32] Producing apparatus 1 according to the present invention is suitable for<br>
implementation of the producing process according to the present invention<br>
discussed below, which comprises a propylene production step and an aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step. Separation of the Cg+fraction has conventionally been<br>
necessary when producing propylene and aromatic hydrocarbons from olefinic<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock, but this is not required in producing apparatus 1 for<br>
implementing the producing process according to the present invention. Therefore,<br>
because producing apparatus 1 according to the present invention comprises<br>
propylene production reactor 12 and aromatic hydrocarbon production reactor 18<br>
with only one separator 16 between propylene production reactor 12 and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production reactor 18, it is a simple apparatus capable of efficiently and<br>
stably producing propylene and aromatic hydrocarbons from an olefinic hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock.<br>
[0O33] In the following explanation, the propylene production step and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step of the producing process according to the present<br>
invention are discussed separately.<br>
[0O34] [Propylene production step]<br>
A hydrocarbon feedstock containing 50 % by weight or more of at least<br>
one of C4-12 olefin is used in the propylene production step.<br>
In the propylene production step, the term "hydrocarbon feedstock" refers<br>
to a raw material containing mainly at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
the C1-12 hydrocarbons, such as for example the C1-12 normal paraffins, isoparaffins,<br>
olefins, cycloparaffins (naphthenes) and cycloparaffins having side chain alkyl groups.<br>
The term "olefin" used in the producing process according to the present invention<br><br>
refers to cycloparaffins as well as straight-chain, branched and cyclic olefins. If the<br>
olefin content is less than 50 % by weight, the propylene yield will be insufficient.<br>
This hydrocarbon feedstock may also contain, as impurities, small quantities of tert-<br>
butanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, methanol and other oxygen-containing compounds.<br>
[0O35] The hydrocarbon feedstock can be used as is in the propylene production<br>
step if the total content of propadiene, butadiene, pentadiene and other diolefin<br>
(diene) compounds and methyl acetylene and other acetylene compounds is not<br>
more than 2.5 % by mass. When more stable propylene production is desired, the<br>
content should be 2 % by mass or less. These dieolefin compounds are highly<br>
polymerizable and are known as a cause of coking deterioration. Of course, it is<br>
generally desirable to reduce diene compounds as much as possible by a treatment<br>
such as distillation, partial hydrogenation or the like, but such pre-treatment is of<br>
course extremely impractical for industrial purposes.<br>
[0O36] Desirable examples of hydrocarbon feedstocks that can be used in the<br>
propylene production step include the following.<br>
(1)	C4 and C5 fractions isolated from products of thermal cracking of naphtha and<br>
other petroleum hydrocarbons, and fractions obtained by partial hydrogenation of<br>
diolefins into olefins in these C4 and C5 fractions;<br>
(2)	Fractions obtained by isolating and removing some or all of the butadiene and<br>
isobutene from the aforementioned C4 fractions;<br>
(3)	Fractions obtained by isolating and removing some or all of the isoprene and<br>
cyclopentadiene from the aforementioned C5 fractions;<br>
(4)	C4 fractions and gasoline fractions isolated from products obtained by fluidized<br>
catalytic cracking (FCC) of vacuum gas oil and other petroleum hydrocarbons;<br>
(5)	C4 fractions and gasoline fractions isolated from cokers;<br><br>
(6) C4 fractions and / or gasoline fractions isolated from hydrocarbons synthesized by<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reaction (FT synthesis) from carbon monoxide and hydrogen.<br>
These may be used individually, or two or more may be used as a mixture.<br>
[0O37] In the propylene production step, the hydrocarbon feedstock such as<br>
those described above is brought into contact in propylene production reactor 12 with<br>
a specific zeolite-containing molded catalyst to thereby perform a catalytic conversion<br>
reaction of at least one of C4-12 olefin contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock,<br>
producing a reaction mixture containing propylene, and propylene is then separated<br>
from the resulting reaction mixture in separator 18.<br>
[0O38] In the propylene production step, a so-called "medium pore diameter<br>
zeolite" with a pore diameter of from 5 to 6.5 A is used as the zeolite in the<br>
aforementioned zeolite-containing molded catalyst A. The term "medium pore<br>
diameter zeolite" refers to a zeolite with a range of pore diameters between the pore<br>
diameters of small-pore zeolites (typically A-type zeolites) and the pore diameters of<br>
large-pore zeolites (typically mordenite and X-type and Y-type zeolites), which zeolite<br>
has an 10-membered oxygen ring in the crystal structure. Examples of the medium<br>
pore diameter zeolites may include ZSM-5 and so-called pentasil zeolites, which are<br>
structurally similar to ZSM-5. These may include ZSM-5, ZSM-8, ZSM-11, ZSM-12,<br>
ZSM-18, ZSM-23, ZSM-35 and ZSM-39. Of these zeolites, the most desirable types<br>
of zeolites are those represented as MFI structures according to the IUPAC<br>
nomenclature for zeolite frameworks, and ZSM-5 is particular desirable. A zeolite<br>
similar to ZSM-5 or ZSM-11 as described in PA. Jacobs and J. A. Martens, "Stud.<br>
Surf. Sci. Catal.", 33, p. 167 to 215 (1987, Netherlands) can also be used.<br>
[0O39] A zeolite containing substantially no protons can be used as the zeolite in<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene production step. The term<br>
"containing substantially no protons" in the producing process according to the<br><br>
present invention means that the amount of proton (i.e., amount of acid) of the zeolite<br>
is 0.02 mmol or less per gram of zeolite as measured by the liquid phase ion<br>
exchange / filtrate titration method explained below. Preferably, the amount of proton<br>
is 0.01 mmol or less per gram of zeolite.<br>
[0040] The liquid phase ion exchange / filtrate titration method is described in<br>
Intrazeolite Chemistry, "ACS Symp. Ser." 218, p. 369 to 382 (1983, USA); Nihon<br>
Kagakukaishi (Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan), 3, p. 521 to 527 (1989,<br>
Japan) and the like. Using this method, the amount of proton can be measured as<br>
follows. A zeolite-containing molded catalyst is calcined in air and then subjected to<br>
ion exchange treatment using an aqueous NaCI solution, after which the molded<br>
catalyst is collected by filtration, and a filtrate is also obtained. The collected molded<br>
catalyst is washed with pure water, and the whole amount of the resultant wash liquid<br>
is collected and mixed with the aforementioned filtrate. The amount of proton of the<br>
resulting mixed solution is measured by neutralization titration, and a value per<br>
weight of the zeolite in the zeolite-containing molded catalyst is given as the amount<br>
of proton of the zeolite. Ammonium ion-type zeolites and multivalent metal cation-<br>
type zeolites (such as rare earth metal cation-type zeolites) are known to generate<br>
protons by heating. Therefore, the zeolite-containing molded catalyst should be<br>
calcined prior to measurement of the amount of proton by the aforementioned<br>
method.<br>
[0041] The zeolite of zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene<br>
production step contains at least one metal selected from the group consisting of<br>
metals belonging to Group IB of the period table (hereinafter referred to as "Group IB<br>
metals"), or in other words from the group consisting of copper, silver and gold. Of<br>
these metals, copper and silver are preferred, and silver is especially preferred. The<br>
term "periodic table" in the present specification means the periodic table described<br><br>
on pages 1 to 15 of the CRC handbook of Chemistry and Physics (75th Edition) by<br>
David R. Lide et al. (published by CRC Press Inc., 1994-1995).<br>
[0042] The term "Containing a Group IB metal" means containing the Group IB<br>
metal in the form of the corresponding cations. However, in addition to cations of the<br>
Group IB metal the zeolite may further contain the Group IB metal in another form,<br>
such as oxide form. Examples of methods of incorporating the Group IB metal into<br>
the zeolite may include methods of treating a zeolite containing no Group IB metal by<br>
the conventional method, such as ion exchange, impregnation or kneading, and<br>
preferably by an ion-exchange method. When the ion-exchange method is used to<br>
incorporate the Group IB metal into the zeolite, a salt of the Group IB metal must be<br>
used. Examples of the Group IB metal salts may include silver nitrate, silver acetate,<br>
silver sulfate, copper chloride, copper sulfate, copper nitrate and gold chloride.<br>
[0043] The amount of the Group IB metal contained as Group IB metal cations in<br>
the zeolite-containing molded catalyst is not strictly limited, but is preferably from 0.01<br>
to 5 % by mass, more preferably from 0.02 to 3 % by mass, based on the weight of<br>
the zeolite. If the Group IB metal content is less than 0.01 % by mass, the catalytic<br>
activity of the zeolite-containing catalyst will be unsatisfactory, while addition of more<br>
than 5 % by mass will generally result in no further improvement in the performance<br>
of the zeolite-containing catalyst. The Group IB metal content of the zeolite can be<br>
determined by the known method such as x-ray fluorescence analysis.<br>
[0044] Because in a preferred embodiment as discussed above the zeolite of<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene production step contains<br>
substantially no protons, the ion-exchange sites remaining after exchange with the<br>
Group IB metal cations are preferably ion-exchanged with the cations of at least one<br>
of the metal selected from the alkali metals and alkali earth metals. More preferably<br>
they are ion-exchanged with the cations of at least one of the metal selected from the<br><br>
alkali metals, and still more preferably with the cations of at least one of the metal<br>
selected from the group consisting of sodium and potassium. In other words, the<br>
zeolite of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst in the propylene production step is<br>
preferably a zeolite that contains both the Group IB metal and at least one of the<br>
metal selected from the alkali metals and alkali earth metals.<br>
[0045] The method used to incorporate at least one metal selected from the<br>
alkali metals and alkali earth metals into the zeolite may be one similar to the method<br>
used for incorporating the Group IB metal into the zeolite. The content of the at least<br>
one metal selected from the alkali metals and alkali earth metals differs depending on<br>
the type of metal, but is preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 0.4 % by mass, based<br>
on the weight of the zeolite in the case of sodium and 0.01 to 0.8 % by mass, based<br>
on the weight of the zeolite in the case of potassium.<br>
[0046] When preparing zeolite-containing molded catalyst A for use in the<br>
propylene production step, there are no particular limits on the number of times or<br>
order in which the method for incorporating at least one metal selected from the alkali<br>
metals and alkali earth metals into the zeolite and the method for incorporating the<br>
Group IB metal are performed. In any case, however, as discussed above, the<br>
zeolite must be made to contain the metal in such a way that it also contains<br>
substantially no protons. For example, when preparing a silver / sodium cation<br>
exchange-type catalyst as the zeolite-containing molded catalyst for the propylene<br>
production step, because some of the silver cannot be carried as silver cations if an<br>
alkali component is present in the zeolite-containing molded catalyst, the zeolite is<br>
preferably converted to a proton type during molding. Thus, the zeolite-containing<br>
molded catalyst, which has been molded as a proton-type zeolite, is first exchanged<br>
with sodium (preferably using an aqueous sodium nitrate solution) to convert it into a<br><br>
sodium (proton-free) type, and then exchanged with silver cations (preferably using<br>
an aqueous silver nitrate solution).<br>
[0047] A SiO2 / AI2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite in zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst A in the propylene production step is preferably at least 800 but no more<br>
than 2,000. If the'SiO2/ AI2O3 molar ratio is less than 800, the zeolite-containing--<br>
molded catalyst will deteriorate more rapidly due to coking in the conversion reaction,<br>
resulting in a greater replacement frequency when the propylene production step is<br>
accomplished by a fixed bed 2-reactor swing system for example, and therefore in<br>
greater regeneration frequency. Consequently, regeneration degradation is also<br>
accelerated. When the hydrocarbon feedstock contains diolefin compounds,<br>
moreover, coking deterioration is more severe and the replacement frequency is<br>
even greater, which soon makes it difficult to continue stable operation. To avoid this,<br>
it is necessary to pre-treat the diolefin compounds in the raw material, which is<br>
impractical for industrial purposes.<br>
[0048] On the other hand, the SiO2/ AI2O3 molar ratio of more than 2,000, there<br>
is a problem from the standpoint of catalyst preparation. To maintain the catalyst<br>
activity of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst A with a high SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio,<br>
the ion-exchange rate of the zeolite must be increased so as to adjust the silver<br>
content to an equivalent amount. However, the ion-exchange rate declines as the<br>
exchange rate increases when preparing the proton-free, IB metal-exchanged<br>
catalyst by ion exchange of a zeolite-containing molded catalyst.<br>
[0049] To avoid this it is necessary to increase the metal concentration of the<br>
exchange liquid. When the SiO2/ Al2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite exceeds 2,000, it<br>
becomes more difficult to accomplish both ion exchange with the alkali metal and ion<br>
exchange with the Group IB metal, and a long time and many steps are required for<br>
catalyst preparation when the present invention is used industrially. An excess of<br><br>
chemical liquid is also required, thereby greatly increasing the amount of wastewater<br>
produced among other problems.<br>
[0050] The SiO2 / Al2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite contained in the zeolite-<br>
containing molded catalyst A used in the propylene production step is preferably at<br>
least 900 but no more than 1,800, more preferably at least 1,000 but no more than<br>
1,600. WO 2000/010948 discloses a similar zeolite catalyst. However, in this<br>
example the focus is on a zeolite with a SiO2/ AI2O3 molar ratio of 300, and reaction<br>
results are only disclosed up to 24 hours. A zeolite catalyst with a SiO2/ AI2O3 molar<br>
ratio of 3,000 has also been described, but this was obtained by compression<br>
molding of zeolite powder, and there are no examples of zeolite catalysts that are<br>
industrially applicable.<br>
[0051] The SiO2 / AI2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite can be measured by the<br>
conventional method, such as for example the method in which the zeolite is<br>
completely dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution or aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solution, and the resulting solution is analyzed by plasma emission spectrometry or<br>
the like to determine the ratio.<br>
[0052] A metalloaluminosilicate in which some of the aluminum atoms in the<br>
zeolite framework are replaced by atoms of Ga, Fe, B, Cr or the like, or a<br>
metallosilicate in which all the aluminum atoms in the zeolite frameworks are<br>
replaced by such atoms, can also be used as the zeolite of zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst A in the propylene production step. In this case, the SiO2/ AI2O3 molar ratio<br>
is calculated after converting the contents of the aforementioned elements in the<br>
metalloaluminosilicate or metallosilicate into moles of alumina.<br>
[0053] If desired, at least one metal selected from the group consisting of the<br>
metals in Groups lIb, III, Vb, Vlb, Vllb and VIII, such as V, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Pt, Pd, Fe,<br>
Ni, Zn, Ga or the like, may be included in zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the<br><br>
propylene production step in order to suppress coking deterioration and improve the<br>
propylene yield.<br>
[0054] If desired, the zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene<br>
production step may be heat treated at 500°C or more in the presence of steam prior<br>
to contact with the hydrocarbon feedstock in order to improve the resistance of the<br>
zeolite to coking deterioration. This heat treatment is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature of at least 500°C but no more than 900°C under a steam partial<br>
pressure of 0.01 atm or more.<br>
[0055] The zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene production step<br>
may suffer from coking deterioration if used in the conversion reaction for a long<br>
period of time. The deteriorated catalyst can be regenerated by burning off the coke<br>
on the catalyst at a temperature of 400 to 700°C, usually in an atmosphere of air or a<br>
gaseous mixture of oxygen and an inert gas (this treatment is hereinafter referred to<br>
as "regeneration treatment").<br>
[0056] For the zeolite-containing molded catalyst A in the propylene production<br>
step, a porous, flame-resistant, inorganic oxide such as alumina, silica, silica /<br>
alumina, zirconia, titania, diatomaceous earth or clay is generally mixed as a binder<br>
or molding diluent (matrix) with the aforementioned zeolite to obtain a mixture which<br>
is then molded, and the resulting molded body is used as the zeolite-containing<br>
molded catalyst. When using the matrix or binder, the content thereof is preferably<br>
from 10 to 90 % by mass, more preferably from 20 to 50 % by mass, based on the<br>
total weight of the zeolite and the matrix or binder.<br>
[0057] In the propylene production step, the reaction container is filled with the<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst A such as that described above, and a catalytic<br>
conversion reaction is performed with at least one C4-12 olefin. The catalytic<br>
conversion reaction of the C4-12 olefin is preferably effected under the reaction<br><br>
conditions described below, whereby the C4-12 olefins in the hydrocarbon feedstock<br>
are converted to propylene with high selectivity, with substantially no reaction of<br>
paraffins coexisting in the hydrocarbon feedstock. The reaction temperature is<br>
preferably from 400 to 600°C, more preferably from 500 to 580°C. The pressure of<br>
the hydrocarbon feedstock should be low, and is generally from 0.01 to 1 MPa,<br>
preferably from 0.05 to 0.3 MPa. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock should be in the range of from 1 to 100 hr-1, preferably from 2<br>
to 20 hr-1, based on the weight of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst. The contact<br>
time between the hydrocarbon feedstock and the zeolite-containing molded catalyst<br>
A is preferably 5 seconds or less, more preferably 1 second or less.<br>
[0058] The hydrocarbon feedstock may be a mixture with a dilution gas.<br>
Examples of the dilution gas may include an inactive gas such as hydrogen, methane,<br>
steam, nitrogen or the like, but hydrogen dilution is not desirable. This is because<br>
although hydrogen can be used to suppress coking deterioration of the catalyst, it<br>
also causes hydrogenation reactions of the resulting propylene and the like, thereby<br>
detracting from the propylene purity (propylene / (propylene + propane)). In the<br>
producing process according to the present invention, hydrogen dilution is preferably<br>
avoided because stable operation with minimal coking deterioration of the catalyst<br>
can be achieved without diluting with hydrogen.<br>
[0059] When the propylene production step is performed under the<br>
aforementioned conditions under which there is substantially no reaction of paraffins,<br>
the olefins in the hydrocarbon feedstock selectively undergo a conversion reaction<br>
while paraffin conversion reactions are suppressed, and bi-products such as<br>
methane, ethane, propane and the like that are produced by paraffin conversion are<br>
controlled, facilitating separation and purification of propylene from the reaction<br>
mixture.<br><br>
[0060] In the propylene production step, a fixed-bed reactor, moving-bed reactor,<br>
fluidized-bed reactor or stream transport system can be used as the propylene<br>
production reactor wherein zeolite-containing molded catalyst A is brought into<br>
contact with the hydrocarbon feedstock, and a structurally simple adiabatic fixed-bed<br>
reactor is preferred.<br>
[0061] Because the zeolite-containing molded catalyst A used in the propylene<br>
production step resists deterioration due to coking, propylene can be stably produced<br>
for a long period of time even using the fixed-bed reactor. The conversion reaction of<br>
paraffins is highly endothermic, whereas the conversion reaction of olefins is slightly<br>
endothermic or exothermic, depending on the reaction conditions. When olefins in<br>
the hydrocarbon feedstock are selectively reacted under the aforementioned<br>
conditions under which substantially no reaction of paraffins in the hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock occurs, therefore, it is not necessary to supply reaction heat, and a simple<br>
reactor system such as the fixed bed, single-stage adiabatic reactor can be used.<br>
[0062] Propylene is separated from the propylene-containing reaction mixture<br>
thus obtained. Specifically, in the first process of propylene separation the<br>
aforementioned reaction mixture is separated into fraction C containing mainly<br>
hydrogen and C1-3 hydrocarbons and fraction D containing mainly at least one of C4+<br>
hydrocarbon, and propylene is separated from fraction C. In the second process, the<br>
reaction mixture is separated into fraction E containing mainly hydrogen and C1-2<br>
hydrocarbons and fraction F containing mainly at least one of C3+ hydrocarbon,<br>
fraction F is separated into fraction F-i containing mainly C3 hydrocarbons and<br>
fraction F2 containing mainly at least one of C4+ hydrocarbon, and propylene is<br>
isolated from fraction F-i. These separation processes can be accomplished through<br>
a combination of various known methods such as fractional distillation, extraction and<br>
the like.<br><br>
[0063] As discussed above, in addition to propylene the aforementioned reaction<br>
mixture contains C4+ olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons. Consequently, a so-called<br>
recycling reaction system, in which a part of the C4+ olefins in the reaction mixture are<br>
recycled back to the reactor and reacted again, can be used to increase the<br>
propylene yield based on the weight of the hydrocarbon feedstock containing 50 %<br>
by mass or more of at least one of C4-12 olefin which is the feedstock in this propylene<br>
production step, thereby making more effective use of the hydrocarbon feedstock.<br>
[0064] In the producing process according to the present invention, a part of<br>
fraction D or fraction F2 can be recycled back to the propylene production reactor and<br>
used as part of the hydrocarbon feedstock. That is, the simplest possible recycling<br>
process can be constructed by using the aforementioned fraction D or F2 as is as a<br>
raw material for recycling without any refinement.<br>
[0065] In order to efficiently obtain propylene from the recycling process in the<br>
propylene production step, a value obtained by dividing the amount of component (%<br>
by mass) of the C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbons produced in the reactor by the<br>
hydrocarbon partial pressure [MPa] is preferably 13 or less, more preferably 10 or<br>
less. This calculated value means that it is desirable, in order to efficiently obtain<br>
propylene, to minimize production of the C
decrease in catalytic activity is likely if the value is 13 or more or in other words if the<br>
reaction conditions are such that aromatic hydrocarbons are easily produced. When<br>
more of the C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbon component is produced in the reactor, not<br>
only does the propylene yield decrease, but the ratio of C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
components and Cg+ aromatic hydrocarbon components in the recycled raw material<br>
increases. As a result, accumulation and coking become a problem in the reactor.<br>
The advantage of the calculated value of 13 or less is that the ratio of olefin<br>
components increases in the Cg+ component, which converts relatively easily into an<br><br>
aromatic hydrocarbon component, and the propylene yield can be increased by<br>
recycling this component.<br>
[0066] A propylene production ratio can be easily increased by increasing the<br>
recycling ratio. Conversely, the aromatic hydrocarbon production ratio can be<br>
increased by either decreasing the recycling ratio in the propylene production step or<br>
stopping recycling and supplying more hydrocarbon components to the subsequent<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon production step.<br>
[0067] The method of suppressing production of C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
components in the propylene production step is not particularly limited, but a normal<br>
method is to reduce the olefin conversion ratio of the hydrocarbon feedstock. The<br>
olefin conversion ratio here is the olefin conversion ratio based on butene as<br>
represented by the following formula.<br>
Olefin conversion ratio (%) = {(C4+ olefin concentration in hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock at reactor inlet - butene concentration in hydrocarbon components<br>
at reactor outlet) / C4+ olefin concentration in hydrocarbon feedstock at<br>
reactor inlet} x 100<br>
A desirable olefin conversion ratio is 40 to 75 % by mass.<br>
[0068] The method of reducing the olefin conversion ratio is not particularly<br>
limited, but possible methods include raising the weight hourly space velocity of the<br>
hydrocarbon feedstock, lowering the reaction temperature, or raising the SiO2/ AI2O3<br>
molar ratio of the medium pore diameter zeolite in the medium pore diameter zeolite-<br>
containing catalyst. Moreover, the zeolite of the present invention, which contains at<br>
least one metal element selected from the group consisting of the metal elements in<br>
group IB of the periodic table and substantially no protons, produces few C6-s<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons in comparison with commonly used H-type zeolites, allowing<br><br>
the olefin conversion ratio to be increased, which has the effect of increasing the<br>
propylene yield.<br>
[0069] In the propylene production step, the recycling ratio of fraction D or<br>
fraction F2 is preferably from 10 to 95 % by mass, more preferably from 15 to 90 %<br>
by mass. If the recycling ratio is less than 10 % by mass, the propylene yield will not<br>
be greatly improved. If the recycling ratio exceeds 95 % by mass, paraffin<br>
components contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock and C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
components produced in the reactor will accumulate in large quantities, increasing<br>
the burden on the reaction apparatus.<br>
[0070] The ratio of Cg+ hydrocarbon components in fraction D or F2 in the<br>
propylene production process is preferably 20 % by mass or less, more preferably<br>
15 % by mass or less. When the conditions are such that this ratio of Cg+<br>
hydrocarbon components exceeds 20 % by mass, the ratio of aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
components in this Cg+ hydrocarbon component will be greater, and propylene will<br>
not be obtained efficiently.<br>
[0071] The propylene production step is explained in more detail using an<br>
example in which the hydrocarbon feedstock is a C4 fraction (fraction containing<br>
mainly C4 hydrocarbons such as butane, isobutane, butene, isobutene and the like)<br>
obtained from a steam cracking product of petroleum hydrocarbons.<br>
[0072] Figure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the recycling reaction system<br>
of a propylene production step using a C4 fraction as the hydrocarbon feedstock. A<br>
reaction mixture (comprising hydrogen and Ci+ hydrocarbons) is separated into a<br>
fraction containing mainly hydrogen and C1-3 hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"H2~-C3 fraction") and a fraction containing mainly at least one C4+ hydrocarbon<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "C4+fraction"). Examples of the apparatus used for<br>
separation (C3 separator) may include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid<br><br>
separator) or the like, preferably a distillation column. Propylene is collected from the<br>
resulting H2~C3 fraction. At least part of the C4+fraction can be recycled back to the<br>
reactor and used as part of the propylene production raw material. When the<br>
C4+fraction is recycled, the butane contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock is<br>
concentrated in the C4+fraction. Since butane therefore accumulates when the entire<br>
C4+fraction is recycled, butane accumulation can be controlled if the amount of the<br>
C4+fraction that is recycled back to the propylene production reactor is limited to part<br>
of the obtained C4+fraction.<br>
[0073] The H2~C3 fraction may be further separated into a fraction containing<br>
mainly hydrogen and C1-2 hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "C2-fraction") and<br>
a fraction containing mainly hydrocarbons with 3 carbon atoms (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "C3 fraction"). Examples of the apparatus used for separation (C2 separator)<br>
may include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid separator) or the like,<br>
preferably a distillation column. Ethylene can be collected from the C2-fraction, or<br>
when selectively producing propylene, at least part of this C2-fraction can be recycled<br>
back to the reactor, and the ethylene in the C2-fraction can be used as part of the raw<br>
material. Because the C2-fraction contains hydrogen, methane and ethane in<br>
addition to ethylene, hydrogen, methane and ethane accumulate when the entire C2-<br>
fraction is recycled. Therefore, accumulation of hydrogen, methane and ethane can<br>
be controlled if the amount of the C2-fraction that is recycled back to the reactor is<br>
limited to only part of the obtained C2-fraction.<br>
[0074] The aromatic hydrocarbon yield can also be increased by using this C2-<br>
fraction as a raw material in the subsequent aromatic hydrocarbon production step.<br>
Moreover, propylene collected from the C3 fraction can be used as is as chemical<br>
grade propylene if the reaction conditions and separation conditions are set<br>
appropriately.<br><br>
[0075] The C4+fraction can also be separated into a fraction containing mainly C4<br>
hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "C4 fraction") and a fraction containing<br>
mainly at least one of Cs+hydrocarbon (hereinafter referred to as "Cs+fraction"). The<br>
C4 fraction can be separated from the C4+fraction either before or after the<br>
C4+fraction is recycled. Examples of the apparatus used for separation (C4<br>
separator) may include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid separator) or the<br>
like, preferably a distillation column. Part of the resulting C4 fraction and / or<br>
Cs+fraction can be recycled back to the propylene production reactor and used as<br>
part of the hydrocarbon feedstock.<br>
[0076] Figure 3 shows another preferred embodiment of a recycling reaction<br>
system using a C4 fraction as the hydrocarbon feedstock. A reaction mixture<br>
(comprising hydrogen and Ci+ hydrocarbons) is separated into a fraction containing<br>
mainly hydrogen and C1-2 hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "C2-fraction") and<br>
a fraction containing mainly at least one of C3+ hydrocarbon (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "C3+fraction"). Examples of the apparatus used for separation (C2 separator) may<br>
include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid separator) or the like, preferably a<br>
distillation column. Ethylene can also be collected from the C2-fraction. When<br>
selectively producing propylene, at least part of this C2-fraction can be recycled back<br>
to the propylene reactor as discussed above, and the ethylene in the C2-fraction can<br>
be used as part of the raw material. It can also be used as the raw material in the<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon production step in order to increase the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
yield.<br>
[0077] Likewise, the C3+fraction can be further separated into a fraction<br>
containing mainly C3 hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "C3 fraction") and a<br>
fraction containing mainly at least one of C4+ hydrocarbon (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"C4+fraction"). Examples of the apparatus used for separation (C3 separator) may<br><br>
include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid separator) or the like, preferably a<br>
distillation column. Moreover, propylene collected from the C3 fraction can be used<br>
as is as chemical grade propylene if the reaction conditions and separation<br>
conditions are set appropriately.<br>
[0078] At least part of the C4+fraction can be recycled back to the reactor and<br>
used as part of the propylene production raw material. When the C4+fraction is<br>
recycled, the butane contained in the hydrocarbon feedstock is concentrated in the<br>
C4+fraction. Since butane therefore accumulates when the entire C4+fraction is<br>
recycled, butane accumulation can be controlled if the amount that is recycled back<br>
to the reactor is restricted to only part of the obtained C4+fraction. As explained<br>
above with reference to Figure 2, the C4+fraction can also be separated into a<br>
fraction containing mainly C4 hydrocarbons (hereinafter referred to as "C4 fraction")<br>
and a fraction containing mainly at least one of C5+ hydrocarbon (hereinafter referred<br>
to as "C5+fraction"). The C4 fraction can be separated from the C4+fraction either<br>
before or after the C4+fraction is recycled. Examples of the apparatus used for<br>
separation (C4 separator) may include a distillation column, flash drum (gas-liquid<br>
separator) or the like, preferably a distillation column. At least part of the resulting C4<br>
fraction and / or Cs+fraction can be recycled back to the reactor and used as part of<br>
the hydrocarbon feedstock.<br>
[0079] [Aromatic hydrocarbon production step]<br>
The zeolite used in zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step has a pore diameter of from 5 to 6.5 A. That is, the<br>
"medium pore diameter zeolite" is used. Examples of the medium pore diameter<br>
zeolites are given above with reference to the propylene production step. Of these,<br>
the most desirable types of zeolites are those represented as MFI structures<br><br>
according to the IUPAC nomenclature for zeolite frameworks, and ZSM-5 is particular<br>
desirable.<br>
[0080] The zeolite of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step contains at least one metal selected from the group<br>
consisting of metals belonging to Group IB of the period table (hereinafter referred to<br>
as "Group IB metals"), or in other words from the group consisting of copper, silver<br>
and gold. Of these metals, copper and silver are preferred, and silver is especially<br>
preferred.<br>
[0081] [ A "zeolite containing a Group IB metal" in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production step is preferably one that contains the Group IB metal in the form of the<br>
corresponding cations. The IB metal cations carried by ion exchange on the zeolite<br>
used in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step are a cause of cracking activity?/<br>
[0082] Examples of methods for incorporating the Group IB metal into the zeolite<br>
may include methods in which a zeolite containing no Group IB metal is treated by<br>
the conventional method, such as ion exchange, impregnation or kneading, and<br>
preferably is treated by an ion-exchange method. When the ion-exchange method is<br>
used to incorporate the Group IB metal into the zeolite, a salt of the Group IB metal<br>
must be used. Examples of Group IB metal salts may include silver nitrate, silver<br>
acetate, silver sulfate, copper chloride, copper sulfate, copper nitrate and gold<br>
chloride. Silver nitrate or copper nitrate is preferred, and silver nitrate is especially<br>
preferred.<br>
[0083] An amount of the Group IB metal contained in zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst B is not strictly limited, but is preferably from 0.01 to 5 % by mass, more<br>
preferably from 0.02 to 3 % by mass, based on the weight of the zeolite. If the Group<br>
IB metal content is less than 0.01 % by mass, the catalytic activity of the zeolite-<br>
containing catalyst will be unsatisfactory, while addition of more than 5 % by mass<br><br>
will generally result in no further improvement in the performance of the zeolite-<br>
containing catalyst. The amount of the Group IB metal contained in zeolite-<br>
containing molded catalyst B can be determined by the known method such as x-ray<br>
fluorescence analysis.<br>
[0084] As well as being included in the zeolite as cations, the Group IB metal in<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step<br>
may also be included in a form other than cations as discussed below, such as an<br>
oxide form. As discussed below the Group IB metal contributes strong<br>
dehydrogenation ability to the catalyst of the present invention, and is included in<br>
order to improve the aromatic hydrocarbon yield.<br>
[0085] /The ion-exchange sites that are not exchanged with Group IB metal<br>
cations of zeolite contained in zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step are of course exchanged with protons or metal cations,<br>
and are preferably exchanged with alkali metal cations or Group IIB, Group IIIB or<br>
Group VIM metal cationsj<br>
[0086] The SiO2 / AI2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite in zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step is preferably at least 60 but<br>
no more than 200. If the SiO2/ Al2O3 molar ratio is less than 60 the catalyst will be<br>
somewhat less stable with respect to high-temperature steam and be less resistant to<br>
regeneration degradation, which is undesirable because the activity is likely to<br>
decline gradually in the course of repeated reaction and regeneration when the<br>
present invention is applied industrially. If the SiO^/ AI2O3 molar ratio exceeds 200,<br>
on the other hand, a sufficient amount of Group IB metal will not be carried by ion<br>
exchange, detracting from cracking activity and from aromatic hydrocarbon yield.<br>
Moreover, in order to maintain the catalytic activity of the zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst with a high SiC&gt;2 / AI2O3 molar ratio, the ion-exchange ratio of the zeolite<br><br>
needs to be increased so as to adjust the Group IB metal content to an equivalent<br>
amount, but the ion-exchange ratio of the Group IB metal then declines, increasing<br>
the burden of catalyst preparation, which is highly undesirable for industrial purposes.<br>
[0087] The SiC&gt;2 / Al2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite in zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step is more preferably at least 80<br>
but no more than 120. The SiO2/ AI2O3 molar ratio of the zeolite can be determined<br>
by the known method, such as for example a method in which the zeolite is<br>
completely dissolved in an aqueous alkali solution or aqueous hydrofluoric acid<br>
solution, and the resulting solution is analyzed by plasma emission spectrometry or<br>
the like to determine the ratio.<br>
[0088] A metalloaluminosilicate in which some of the aluminum atoms in the<br>
zeolite framework are replaced by atoms of Ga, Fe, B, Cr or the like, or a<br>
metallosilicate in which all the aluminum atoms in the zeolite frameworks are<br>
replaced by such atoms, can also be used as the zeolite contained in zeolite-<br>
containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step. In this<br>
case, the SiC&gt;2 / AI2O3 molar ratio is calculated after converting the contents of the<br>
aforementioned elements in the metalloaluminosilicate or metallosilicate into moles of<br>
alumina.<br>
[0089] The primary particle diameter of the zeolite contained in zeolite-containing<br>
molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step is in the range of from<br>
0.02 to 0.25 µm. Preferably, the primary particle diameter is in the range of from 0.02<br>
to 0.2 (j.m, more preferably from 0.O3 to 0.15 µm.<br>
[0090] The primary particles of the zeolite contained in zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step may be present as individual<br>
particles or as secondary aggregates. In most cases the primary particles will<br>
aggregate to form secondary particles, and since the primary particles assume<br><br>
various forms, a method of measuring the Feret diameter (see The Society of<br>
Chemical Engineers, Japan Ed., Kagaku Kogaku Binran (Chemical Engineering<br>
Handbook), Revised 6th Edition, p. 233) from a scanning microscope image of zeolite<br>
powder taken at 100,000x magnification can be adopted for measuring the primary<br>
particle diameter in the present invention. Primary particles having this particle<br>
diameter should preferably constitute at least 50 % by mass, more preferably at least<br>
80 % by mass of the total.<br>
[0091] The smaller the particle size of the zeolite, the greater the effective<br>
surface area, which is known to be an advantage in terms of both activity and coking<br>
deterioration. The particle size of the zeolite is affected not by the particle size of<br>
secondary particles formed by aggregation of primary particles, but by the particle<br>
size of the primary particles that can be distinguished at 100,000x magnification<br>
under a scanning electron microscope. Consequently, in zeolite contained in the<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst in the present invention the Feret diameter of the<br>
primary particles as measured by the scanning electron microscopy of zeolite powder<br>
at 100,000x magnification is preferably in the range of from 0.02 to 0.25 urn.<br>
[0092] However, the crystal structure of this fine-particle zeolite is unstable, and<br>
as described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-052646, the lattice<br>
aluminum is easily detached by high-temperature treatment in the presence of steam,<br>
and regeneration (permanent) degradation is likely due to this low hot water stability.<br>
Surprisingly, however, with the zeolite-containing molded catalyst used in the present<br>
invention hot water stability is much improved even in the case of a fine-particle<br>
zeolite, and regeneration degradation can be greatly controlled, the amount of coke<br>
accumulation can be inhibited. According to the present invention, a zeolite-<br>
containing molded catalyst is achieved which is resistant to both the conventional<br>
problems of coking deterioration and regeneration degradation.<br><br>
[0093] IAt least one element selected from the group consisting of the elements<br>
belonging to Groups IB, MB, 1MB and VIII in the period table is included in zeolite-<br>
containing molded catalyst B in order to confer strong dehydrogenation ability on the<br>
catalyst in the aromatic hydrocarbon production stepj The metals copper, zinc,<br>
gallium, indium, nickel, palladium and platinum and oxides and complex oxides<br>
thereof are preferred, and zinc and zinc compounds are most preferred.<br>
[0094] Ion exchange or impregnation is generally used as the method of<br>
incorporating metal elements and compounds of metal elements belonging to Groups<br>
|B, MB, NIB and VIII in the period table into the zeolite-containing molded catalyst B,<br>
in order to confer strong dehydrogenation ability on the catalyst in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step. The amount of metal elements and compounds of<br>
metal elements belonging to Groups IB, IIB, 1MB and VIII in the period table that is<br>
incorporated into the zeolite-containing molded catalyst B is generally from 0.1 to 25<br>
by mass %, preferably from 5 to 20 % by mass as elements, in order to confer strong<br>
dehydrogenation ability on the zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step.<br>
[0095] In the zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production step, a porous, flame-resistant, inorganic oxide such as alumina, silica,<br>
silica / alumina, zirconia, titania, diatomaceous earth or clay can generally be used as<br>
a binder or molding diluent (matrix). Alumina or silica is preferred, and alumina is<br>
especially preferred. A mixture obtained by mixing this with the zeolite described<br>
above is molded, and the resulting molded body is used as the zeolite-containing<br>
molded catalyst. When using the matrix or binder, the content thereof is preferably<br>
from 5 to 50 % by mass, more preferably from 10 to 50 % by mass, based on the<br>
total weight of the zeolite and the matrix or binder.<br><br>
[0096] Zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production step can be subjected to heat treatment at 500°C or more in the presence<br>
of steam prior to contact with the hydrocarbon feedstock with the aim of improving<br>
resistance to coking deterioration. Heat treatment is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature of at least 500°C but no more than 900°C, under a steam pressure of<br>
0.01 atm or more.<br>
[0097] When zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production step contains a mixture of Group IB metal-exchanged zeolite, zinc and a<br>
compound thereof and alumina (which is a preferred example of the producing<br>
process according to the present invention), high-temperature steam treatment<br>
serves to stabilize the zinc component in the catalyst as zinc aluminate, thereby<br>
achieving the additional object of greatly controlling scattering loss of zinc in the<br>
reaction atmosphere. This effect is extremely advantageous for industrial application<br>
of the present invention. The zinc aluminate in the present invention has an x-ray<br>
diffraction pattern identical to the pattern given in JCPDS 5-0669NBS Circ, 539, Vol.<br>
II, 38(1953).<br>
[0098] In a preferred example of the producing process according to the present<br>
invention, in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step an aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production reactor is filled with a specific zeolite-containing molded catalyst B such<br>
as that described above, which is then brought into contact with the hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock (described below) to perform the catalytic cyclization reaction and obtain<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic hydrocarbons are separated and collected<br>
from the resulting reaction mixture by known methods.<br>
[0099] For the hydrocarbon feedstock in the aromatic hydrocarbon production<br>
step, a fraction containing at least one of C4+ hydrocarbon produced in the propylene<br>
production step described above is used as all or a part of the hydrocarbon feedstock.<br><br>
Similarly, a C2-fraction produced in the propylene production step can be used as a<br>
raw material, or light hydrocarbon components may be newly added as a raw<br>
material.<br>
[0100] The light hydrocarbon feedstock that is newly added in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step is a light hydrocarbon feedstock containing at least one<br>
selected from the olefins and paraffins, wherein the hydrocarbons have 2 or more<br>
carbon atoms and a 90 % distillation temperature of 190°C or less. Examples of<br>
such paraffins may include ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane, heptane,<br>
octane and nonane. Examples of such olefins may include ethylene, propylene,<br>
butene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene and nonene. In addition, cyclopentene,<br>
methylcyclopentane, cyclohexene and other cycloparaffins, cyclopentene,<br>
methylcyclopentene, cyclohexane and other cycloolefins and / or cyclohexadiene,<br>
butadiene, pentadiene, cyclopentadiene and other dienes may be included. A<br>
mixture of such hydrocarbons may be used as the raw material, or methane,<br>
hydrogen or an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or the<br>
like may be included in the mixture as a diluent.<br>
[0101] These diluents may constitute preferably 20% or less, more preferably<br>
10% or less by volume. It is particularly desirable to use a mixture containing<br>
saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons at a weight ratio of between 1<br>
/ 0.33 and 1 / 2.33. The weight ratio of saturated hydrocarbons to unsaturated<br>
hydrocarbons here means the weight ratio in the supplied mixture.<br>
[0102] Desirable examples of light hydrocarbon components to be newly added<br>
to a fraction containing mainly at least one of C4+ hydrocarbon produced in the<br>
propylene production step may include the following as above:<br><br>
(1)	C4 and C5 fractions isolated from thermal decomposition products of naphtha and<br>
other petroleum hydrocarbons, and fractions obtained by partial hydrogenation of<br>
diolefins into olefins in these C4 and C5 fractions;<br>
(2)	Fractions obtained by isolating and removing some or all of the butadiene and<br>
isobutene from the aforementioned C4 fraction;<br>
(3)	Fractions obtained by isolating and removing some or all of the isoprene and<br>
cyclopentadiene from the aforementioned C5 fraction;<br><br>
(4)	C4 fractions and / or gasoline fractions isolated from products obtained by<br>
fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of vacuum gas oil and other petroleum<br>
hydrocarbons;<br>
(5)	C4 fractions and / or gasoline fractions isolated from cokers; and<br>
(6)	C4 fractions and / or gasoline fractions isolated from hydrocarbons synthesized by<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reaction (FT synthesis) from carbon monoxide and hydrogen.<br>
[01O3] In the aromatic hydrocarbon production step, the light hydrocarbon<br>
feedstock may also contain, as impurities, tert-butyl alcohol, methyl tert-butyl ether,<br>
methanol and other oxygen-containing compounds.<br>
[0104] The reaction conditions for the aromatic hydrocarbon production step<br>
differ according to the light hydrocarbon feedstock and particularly according to the<br>
weight ratios of olefins and paraffins in the feedstock, but a temperature of from 300<br>
to 650°C, a hydrocarbon partial pressure of between atmospheric pressure and 30<br>
atmospheres, and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of from 0.1 to 50 hr-1<br>
based on the weight of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst are preferred. More<br>
preferably the reaction temperature is in the range of from 400 to 600°C.<br>
[0105] A fixed-bed reactor, moving-bed reactor, fluidized-bed reactor or stream<br>
transport system can be used for the aromatic hydrocarbon production reactor in the<br><br>
aromatic hydrocarbon production step, and a structurally simple adiabatic fixed-bed<br>
reactor is preferred.<br>
[0106] Zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production step may suffer from coking deterioration if used in the conversion<br>
reaction for a long period of time. The deteriorated catalyst can be regenerated by<br>
burning off the coke on the catalyst at a temperature of from 400 to 700°C, usually in<br>
an atmosphere of air or a gaseous mixture of oxygen and an inert gas (this treatment<br>
is hereinafter referred to as "regeneration treatment").<br>
[0107] Because the zeolite-containing molded catalyst B in the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production step is resistant to deterioration from coking, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons can be stably produced over a long period of time even using a fixed-<br>
bed reactor. Since the zeolite-containing molded catalyst in the producing process<br>
according to the present invention is less liable to dealumination in the presence of<br>
high-temperature steam, it also resists permanent degradation (regeneration<br>
degradation) during regeneration treatment, and consequently suffers very little loss<br>
of activity even after repeated reaction and regeneration. Therefore, an aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon compound can be produced stably and with high yield over a long<br>
period of time. These features are extremely useful for industrial application of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[0108] Examples<br>
The present invention is explained in more detail below by means of<br>
examples and comparative examples, but the present invention is in no way limited<br>
by these examples. Measurements in the examples and comparative examples are<br>
performed as follows.<br>
[0109] (1) Measurement of the amount of proton by liquid phase ion exchange /<br>
filtrate titration<br><br>
2.5 g of zeolite-containing molded catalyst that had been ground in a<br>
mortar and baked in air at from 400 to 600°C was subjected to ion-exchange<br>
treatment for 10 minutes with ice cooling in 25 ml of 3.4 mol / liter NaCI aqueous<br>
solution. The resulting mixture was filtered, the molded catalyst was washed with 50<br>
ml of pure water, and whole amount of the filtrate including the wash water was<br>
recovered. This filtrate (including wash water) was analyzed by neutralizing titration<br>
with 0.1 N NaOH aqueous solution, the amount of proton was determined from the<br>
neutralization point, and the amount of proton based on zeolite weight was<br>
determined based on the zeolite content of the zeolite-containing molded catalyst.<br>
[0110] (2) Measurement of zeolite SiC&gt;2 / AI2O3 molar ratio<br>
0.2 g of zeolite was added to 50 g of 5 N NaOH aqueous solution. This<br>
was transferred to a stainless steel microcylinder with a Teflon® inner tube, and the<br>
microcylinder was sealed. This was then maintained for 15 to 70 hours in an oil bath<br>
to completely dissolve the zeolite. The resulting zeolite solution was diluted with ion-<br>
exchanged water, the silicon and aluminum concentrations in the diluted liquid were<br>
measured with a plasma spectrometer (ICP unit), and the SiO/ AI2O3 molar ratio of<br>
the zeolite was calculated from the results.<br>
ICP unit and measurement conditions<br>
Device : JOBIN YVON (JY138 ULTRACE), Rigaku Corp.<br>
Measurement conditions:<br>
Silicon measurement wavelength	251.60 nm<br>
Aluminum measurement wavelength	396.152 nm<br>
Plasma power	1.0 kw<br>
Nebulizer gas	0.28 L/min<br>
Sheath gas	0.3 to 0.8 L/min<br>
Coolant gas	13 L/min<br><br>
[0111] (3)	Measurement of zeolite primary particle diameter<br>
A zeolite powder sample was held with carbon adhesive tape on an<br>
aluminum sample platform, and subjected to Pt deposition with an ion sputterer<br>
(Hitachi E-1O30) to maintain conductivity.<br>
SEM images were taken with a Hitachi FE-SEM (S-800), at an<br>
acceleration voltage (HV) of 20 KV at magnifications of 500, 15,000 and 100,000.<br>
Secondary particles are often formed by aggregation of fine primary<br>
particles in the zeolite used in the present invention, so the Feret diameters of 20 or<br>
more primary particles that were determined to be primary particles because they<br>
appeared as single masses without cracks in the 100,000x scanning electron<br>
microscope image were measured, and the average was given as the primary<br>
particle diameter. When the primary particle diameter was so large that it could not<br>
be evaluated in a 100,000x scanning electron microscope image, a scanning electron<br>
microscope image of a different magnification was selected appropriately for<br>
purposes of comparison, and the primary particle diameter was determined in the<br>
same way.<br>
[0112] (4) Gas chromatography analysis of reaction products<br>

Sample gas volume: 1 ml (sampling line maintained at 200 to 300°C,<br>
liquefaction prevented)<br>
Temperature program: Maintained for 12 minutes at 40°C, then raised to<br>

Measurement method: A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and<br>
hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) were connected in a line, hydrogen and C1 and C2 hydrocarbons were detected with the TCD detector, and C3+ hydrocarbons<br>
were detected with the FID detector. 10 Minutes after the start of analysis, detector<br>
output was switched from TCD to FID.<br>
[0113] (5) Reaction conversion ratio, reaction rate constant<br>
The reaction rate constant K, which is an indicator of catalytic activity, was<br>
determined by the following formula.<br>
Reaction rate constant K = WHSV x ln[1/(1-X)]<br>
[wherein X is the olefin conversion ration based on butene {(C4-8 olefin concentration<br>
in raw materials - butene concentration in product) / C4.8 olefin concentration in raw<br>
materials}].<br>
[0114] [Example 1]<br>
An Na-type ZSM-5 extrudate with a SiO2 / Al2O3 molar ratio of 1200<br>
(containing 30 % by mass of SiC&gt;2 binder, 1.6 mm<t purchased from nikki universal></t>
Co., Ltd., Japan) was dispersed in an 0.02 N aqueous silver nitrate solution (10 cc/g-<br>
molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange treatment at 60°C for 1 hour, a<br>
treatment that was repeated twice. This was then filtered, water-washed and dried to<br>
prepare catalyst A-1. The Ag content of catalyst A-1 as measured by fluorescent x-<br>
ray analysis was 0.22 % by mass.<br>
A Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm was filled with<br>
catalyst A-1, which was then steamed for 5 hours under conditions of temperature<br>
650°C, steam flow rate 214 g / hr, nitrogen flow rate 400 NL / hr, and pressure 0.1<br>
MPaG. After steaming treatment, the amount of proton of catalyst A-1 was 0.002<br><br>
mmol / g as determined by liquid phase ion exchange / filtrate titration. 60 g of the<br>
steamed catalyst A-1 was packed in a Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of<br>
27 mm.<br>
The C4 raffinate-2 (hydrocarbons obtained by extracting and removing the<br>
butadiene and isobutene from a C4 fraction obtained by steam cracking of naphtha)<br>
shown in Table 1 was used as the raw material and supplied at a C4 raffinate-2<br>
supply rate of 360.0 g / hr (WHSV = 6 hr-1) and a steam supply rate of 108 g / hr to<br>
the reactor filled with catalyst A-1 in thereby perform a propylene production reaction<br>
under conditions of reaction temperature 550°C, reaction pressure 0.1 MPaG, and<br>
the resulting reaction product was supplied to a distillation column and separated into<br>
a H2~C3 fraction and a C4+fraction. This propylene production reaction was<br>
continued for 2 days.<br>
The product yields (% by mass) are shown in Table 1. The value<br>
obtained by dividing the amount of component (% by mass) of the C6-8 aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons produced in the reactor by the hydrocarbon partial pressure [MPa] was<br>
9.9.<br>
The primary particle size of the zeolite was 0.06 \im as measured by<br>
scanning electron microscopy with a magnification of 100,000x. 72 parts by mass of<br>
H-type ZSM-5 (SiO2/ Al2O3 molar ratio = 92), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (10 parts by<br>
mass as zinc metal) and alumina sol (18 parts by mass as AI2O3) were kneaded and<br>
extrusion molded to 1.6 mm in diameter, 4 to 6 mm in length. After being dried at<br>
120X for 4 hours, this was baked for 3 hours at 500°C to obtain a molded catalyst<br>
containing zinc carried on zeolite. This catalyst was dispersed in a 1 N sodium<br>
nitrate aqueous solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange<br>
treatment three times at room temperature for 1 hour each time. This was then<br>
filtered, water washed and dried. This was dispersed in a 0.1 N silver nitrate<br><br>
aqueous solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and subjected to ion exchange for 2 hours<br>
at room temperature. This was then filtered, water washed and dried to prepare<br>
catalyst B-1.<br>
The Ag content of catalyst B-1 as measured by fluorescence x-ray<br>
analysis was 1.8% by mass.<br>
A Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm was filled with<br>
catalyst B-1, which was then steamed for 3 hours under conditions of temperature<br>
650°C, steam flow rate 214 g / hr, nitrogen flow rate 400 NL / hr, and pressure 0.1<br>
MPaG. After steaming treatment, 35 g of catalyst B-1 was packed in a Hastelloy C<br>
reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm.<br>
Using this reactor, an aromatic hydrocarbon production reaction was<br>
continued for 2 days with the C4+fraction obtained from the previous propylene<br>
production reaction supplied at a rate of 98 g / hr with a reaction temperature of<br>
515°C at a pressure of 0.5 MPa. The yield of C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons was<br>
47.4 % by mass 8 hours after the start of the reaction and 46.7 % by mass after 48<br>
hours.<br>
As calculated based on the C4 raffinate-2, the yield was 26.8 % by mass<br>
for propylene and 30.6 % by mass for C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
As shown in Table 1, the raw material in the aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
production reaction (the C4+fraction obtained in the previous propylene production<br>
reaction) contains fewer diene compounds than C4 raffinate-2. Diene compounds are<br>
highly polymerizable and not only promote soiling of the equipment but are also<br>
known to be a cause of coking deterioration, so more stable operation can be<br>
achieved in the aromatic hydrocarbon production step if the propylene production<br>
step is performed first.<br>
[0115] [Example 2]<br><br>
60 g of catalyst A-1 that had been steamed as in Example 1 was packed<br>
in a Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm.<br>
Using C4 raffinate-2 shown in Table 1 as the raw material, a propylene<br>
production reaction was performed with a reaction temperature of 550°C, a C4<br>
raffinate-2 supply rate of 220.3 g / hr, a recycled C4+fraction supply rate of 139.7 g /<br>
hr (WHSV = 6 hr-1), a steam supply rate of 108 g / hr and a reaction pressure of 0.1<br>
MPaG, the resulting reaction product was supplied to a distillation column and<br>
separated into a H2~C3 fraction and a C4+fraction, and about 56% of the C4+fraction<br>
was recycled back to the reactor.<br>
The propylene production reaction was continued for 2 days, after which<br>
the catalyst was regenerated under the following conditions: regeneration<br>
temperature 500 to 550°C, regeneration pressure 0.5 MPaG, nitrogen + air flow rate<br>
1008 NL / hr, oxygen concentration 1 to 5 vol %, regeneration time 10 hours. The<br>
yields based on C4 raffinate-2 (% by mass) are shown in Table 1. The value<br>
obtained by dividing the amount of component (% by mass) of the C6-8 aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons produced in the reactor by the hydrocarbon partial pressure [MPa] was<br>
8.9. During regeneration treatment the regeneration gas was sampled periodically at<br>
the reactor outlet, the CO2 and CO concentrations were measured, and the amount<br>
of coke was determined from these values. The coke yield was 72 ppm by mass as<br>
determined by dividing the amount of coke by the total amount of raw materials fed<br>
into the reaction.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon production reaction was continued for 2 days<br>
under the same conditions as in Example 1 except that the raw material was the<br>
C4+fraction obtained in this Example 2. The yield of C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons was<br>
44.7 % by mass 8 hours after the start of the reaction, and 43.9 % by mass after 48<br>
hours.<br><br>
As converted to yields based on C4 raffinate-2, the propylene yield was<br>
38.1 % by mass and the C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons yield was 22.3 % by mass.<br>
[0116] [Example 3]<br>
A propylene production reaction was performed under the same<br>
conditions as in Example 2 except that the C4 raffinate-2 supply rate was 279.1 g / hr,<br>
the recycled C4++fraction supply rate was 80.9 g / hr (WHSV = 6 hr-1), and about<br>
33% of the C4+fraction was recycled back to the reactor. The yields based on the C4<br>
raffinate-2 (% by mass) are shown in Table 1. The propylene yield based on C4<br>
raffinate-2 was 33.24 % by mass 2 hours after the start of the reaction, and 31-35 %<br>
by mass 48 hours after the start of the reaction. The value obtained by dividing the<br>
amount of component (% by mass) of the C6-8 aromatic hydrocarbons produced in<br>
the reactor by the hydrocarbon partial pressure [MPa] was 4.8.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon production reaction was performed under the<br>
same conditions as in Example 1 except that the raw material was the C4+fraction<br>
obtained in this Example 3. The yield of C&amp;.9 aromatic hydrocarbons was 46.3 % by<br>
mass 8 hours after the start of the reaction and 45.5 % by mass after 48 hours.<br>
The yields based on C4 raffinate-2 were 32.4 % by mass for propylene<br>
and 26.5 % by mass for C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The results of Examples 1 to 3 show that the production rates of the<br>
desired propylene and C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons can be varied by means of simple<br>
changes in the operating conditions even using the same raw material.<br>
[0117] [Comparative Example 1]<br>
A molded catalyst containing H-type ZSM-5 with a SiO2/ Al2O3 molar ratio<br>
of 407 (containing 30 % by mass of SiO2 binder, 1.6 mm<j to mml was></j>
dispersed in a 1 N aqueous sodium nitrate solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and was<br>
subjected to ion-exchange treatment for 1 hour at room temperature, a treatment that<br><br>
was repeated three times. This was then filtered, water-washed and dried to prepare<br>
a Na-type ZSM-5 / SiC&gt;2 molded catalyst. This was dispersed in 0.00145 N aqueous<br>
silver nitrate solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange<br>
treatment for 2 hours at room temperature. This was then filtered, water-washed and<br>
dried to prepare catalyst A-2.<br>
The Ag content of the catalyst A-2 as measured by fluorescence x-ray<br>
analysis was 0.094 % by mass.<br>
A Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm was filled with<br>
catalyst A-2, which was then steamed for 5 hours under conditions of temperature<br>
650°C, steam flow rate 218 g / hr, and nitrogen flow rate 220 NL / hr.<br>
After steaming treatment, the amount of proton of catalyst A-2 was 0.0016<br>
mmol / g-zeolite as determined by liquid phase ion exchange / filtrate titration.<br>
A reaction evaluation test was performed as in Example 3 except that the<br>
steamed catalyst A-2 was used. The propylene yield based on C4 raffinate-2 was<br>
27.33 % by mass 2 hours after the start of the reaction and 22.61 % by mass 48<br>
hours after the start of the reaction, giving a somewhat high propylene yield<br>
differential of 4.7 % by mass.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon production reaction was performed under the<br>
same conditions as in Example 1 except that the C4+fraction obtained in this<br>
Comparative Example 1 was used as the raw material. The yield of C6-9 aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons was 47.9 % by mass 2 hours after the start of the reaction and 48.0 %<br>
by mass after 48 hours.<br>
As calculated from these results, the yields based on C4 raffinate-2 were<br>
24.8 % by mass for propylene and 30.8 % by mass for C6-g aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
Comparing Example 3 with Comparative Example 1, not only did the<br>
combined yield of propylene and C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbons drop from 58.9 % by<br><br>
mass (Example 3) to 55.5 % by mass (Comparative Example 1), but there was<br>
greater fluctuation in propylene yield.<br>
The following are reference example involving only propylene production<br>
reactions.<br>
[0118] [Reference Example 1 ]<br>
A H-type ZSM-5 extrudate with a SiO2 / Al2O3 molar ratio of 1000<br>
(containing 30 % by mass of SiC&gt;2 binder, 1.6 mm<t>, purchased from Nikki Universal<br>
Co., Ltd., Japan) was dispersed in a 1 N sodium nitrate aqueous solution (10 cc/g-<br>
molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange treatment at room temperature for 1<br>
hour, a treatment that was repeated 3 times. This was then filtered, water-washed<br>
and dried to prepare Na-type ZSM-5 / SiO2. This was dispersed in a 0.01 N silver<br>
nitrate aqueous solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange<br>
treatment for 2 hours at room temperature. This was then filtered, water-washed and<br>
dried to prepare catalyst A-3. The Ag content of catalyst A-3 as measured by<br>
fluorescence x-ray analysis was 0.15 % by mass.<br>
A quartz glass reactor with an inner diameter of 16 mm was filled with<br>
catalyst A-2, which was then steamed for 5 hours under conditions of temperature<br>
650°C, steam flow rate 27.6 g / hr, and nitrogen flow rate 140 Ncc / min. After<br>
steaming treatment, the amount of proton of catalyst A-3 was 0.002 mmol / g-zeolite<br>
as determined by liquid phase ion exchange / filtrate titration.<br>
A Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 17 mm was filled with 10 g<br>
of the steamed catalyst A-3.<br>
Using this reactor and the C4 raffinate-2 shown in Table 2 as the raw<br>
material, a propylene production reaction was performed with a C4 raffinate-2 supply<br>
rate of 60 g / hr (weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 6 hr-1), a reaction<br>
temperature of 580°C and a pressure of 0.1 MPaG, the resulting reaction product<br><br>
was cooled to about 30°C with a heat exchanger at the reactor outlet and conveyed<br>
to a gas-liquid separation drum, and the liquid (C4+fraction) was separated and<br>
collected. The composition of the collected C4+fraction is shown in Table 2.<br>
Next, a C4+ recycling test was performed for 24 hours under the following<br>
test conditions using the collected C4+fraction and C4 raffinate-2 as the raw materials:<br>
Reaction temperature 580°C, C4 raffinate-2 supply rate 30 g / hr,<br>
C4+fraction supply rate 31-2 g I hr (WHSV = 6.1 hr1), reaction pressure 0.1 MPaG.<br>
The analysis result for the reaction product 12 hours after the start of the<br>
reaction was a propylene yield of 32.1 % by mass based on the C4-8 olefins in the<br>
supplied raw material. However, the C6-8 component in the collected effraction was<br>
considered to be all olefins apart from the aromatic hydrocarbons. The ratio of the<br>
reaction rate constants K 4 hours and 24 hours after the start of the reaction [K(24<br>
hrs) / K(4 hrs)] was 0.90.<br>
[0119] [Reference Example 2]<br>
A propylene production reaction was performed with C4 raffinate-2 under<br>
the same conditions as in Reference Example 1 except that only 60 g / hr (WHSV = 6<br>
hr-1) of C4 raffinate-2 was supplied as the raw material to the reactor. The analysis<br>
result for the reaction product 12 hours after the start of the reaction was a propylene<br>
yield of 31.1 % by mass based on the C4.8 olefins in the supplied raw material. The<br>
ratio of the reaction rate constants K 4 hours and 24 hours after the start of the<br>
reaction [K(24 hrs) / K(4 hrs)] was 0.87.<br>
From comparing Reference Examples 1 and 2, it can be seen that there is<br>
no ill effect on deterioration of the catalyst even if the C4+fraction is used as is as a<br>
recycled material without removing the heavy component. The rise in propylene yield<br>
from 31.1 % by mass (Reference Example 2) to 32.1 % by mass (Reference<br>
Example 1) is due to propylene production from the Cg+ component.<br><br>
[0120] [Example 4]<br>
A H-type ZSM-5 extrudate with a SiO2 / Al2O3 molar ratio of 1220<br>
(containing 30 % by mass of SiO2 binder, 1.6 mm<t>) was dispersed in a 1 N sodium<br>
nitrate aqueous solution (10 cc/g-molded zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange<br>
treatment at room temperature for 1 hour, a treatment that was repeated 3 times.<br>
This was then filtered, water-washed and dried to prepare Na-type ZSM-5 / SiO2.<br>
This was dispersed in a 0.0017 N silver nitrate aqueous solution (10 cc/g-molded<br>
zeolite), and subjected to ion-exchange treatment for 2 hours at room temperature.<br>
This was then filtered, water-washed and dried to prepare catalyst A-4. The Ag<br>
content of catalyst A-4 as measured by fluorescence x-ray analysis was 0.095 % by<br>
mass.<br>
A Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of 27 mm was filled with<br>
catalyst A-4, which was then steamed for 5 hours under conditions of temperature<br>
650°C, steam flow rate 214 g / hr, nitrogen flow rate 400 NL / hr, and pressure 0.1<br>
MPaG. After steaming treatment, the amount of proton of catalyst A-4 was 0.002<br>
mmol / g as determined by liquid phase ion exchange / filtrate titration. 60 g of the<br>
steamed catalyst A-4 was packed in a Hastelloy C reactor with an inner diameter of<br>
27 mm.<br>
Using this reactor and the C4 raffinate-2 shown in Table 3 as the raw<br>
material, a propylene production reaction was performed with a C4 raffinate-2 supply<br>
rate of 268.7 g / hr, a recycled C4+fraction supply rate of 181-3 g / hr (WHSV = 7.5<br>
hr-1), a reaction temperature of 550°C and a reaction pressure of 0.1 MPaG, the<br>
resulting reaction product was supplied to a distillation column, the H2~C3 fraction<br>
and effraction were separated, and about 58% of the C4+fraction was recycled back<br>
to the reactor. The propylene yield [% by mass] based on the C4 raffinate-2 was<br><br>
32.9 % by mass 2 hours after the start of the reaction and 30.4 % by mass after 48<br>
hours.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon production reaction was performed under the<br>
same conditions as in Example 1 except that the C4+fraction obtained in this<br>
Example 4 was used as the raw material. The yield of C&amp;.9 aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
was 45.5 % by mass 2 hours after the start of the reaction and 45.2 % by mass after<br>
48 hours.<br>
As calculated from these results, the yields based on C4 raffinate-2 were<br>
31.7 % by mass for propylene and 24.8 % by mass for aromatic hydrocarbons.<br>
This shows that two days of continuous operation can be accomplished<br>
without any ill effect on deterioration even using a raw material wherein the diolefin<br>
compound concentration is 2.25 % by mass.<br>
[0121] [Example 5]<br>
A reaction was performed under the same conditions as the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon production reaction of Example 2 except that a mixture of the<br>
C4+fraction (60 g / hr) obtained in Example 3 and the C5 fraction shown in Table 3<br>
(38 g / hr) was supplied as the raw material. The C6-9 aromatic hydrocarbon yield<br>
was 44.1 % by mass 8 hours after the start of the reaction and 43.2 % by mass after<br>
48 hours.<br>
The ratio of the aromatic hydrocarbon component can be increased by<br>
adding a fresh light hydrocarbon component as in Example 5. Specifically, when 60<br>
g / hr of the C4+fraction obtained in Example 3 was used as the raw material the C6-9<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon yield 8 hours after the start of the reaction was 46.3 % by<br>
mass, or 60 g / hr x 0.463 = 27.8 g / hr. By contrast, when the mixture of Example 5<br>
was used as the raw material, the C6-g aromatic hydrocarbon yield 8 hours after the<br>
start of the reaction was 44.1 % by mass, or (60 + 38)g / hr x 0.441 = 41.0 g / hr.<br><br>
This shows that the proportion of the aromatic hydrocarbon component can be<br>
increased by adding a fresh light hydrocarbon component.<br>
[0122] [Comparative Example 2]<br>
A H-type ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized by the method described in<br>
Example 1 of the description of Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-<br>
052646. The SiO2 / AI2O3 molar ratio of the resulting zeolite was 42. A zeolite<br>
powder of this zeolite was photographed at 15,000x magnification under a scanning<br>
electron microscope, and the primary particle size of the zeolite was measured and<br>
found to be 1.54 \im.<br>
A molded catalyst containing zinc carried on zeolite, catalyst B-2, was<br>
obtained by the same methods as in Example 1.<br>
A reaction was performed in the same way as the catalytic cyclization<br>
reaction of Example 3 except that catalyst B-2 was used. The yield of C6-9 aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons was 45.1 % by mass 4 hours after the start of the reaction and 42.7 %<br>
by mass after 45 hours.<br>
[0123] From comparing Example 3 and Comparative Example 2, it is<br>
demonstrated that with the conventional H-type zeolite, hot water stability is much<br>
less than with the catalyst of the present invention even if the zeolite used is one<br>
having the physical properties stipulated in the invention disclosed in Japanese<br>
Patent Application Laid-open No. H10-052646. This is because even if the zeolite<br>
has a lower SiO/ AI2O3 molar ratio (has more reactivity sites), the yield of aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons is low at the start of the reaction with an H-type zeolite. This means<br>
that more permanent degradation (regeneration degradation) over time is likely in<br>
industrial use. In terms of particle size, moreover, the primary particle size of the<br>
zeolite is greater than that of the zeolite used in the zeolite-containing molded<br>
catalyst of the present invention, meaning that the speed of deterioration (coking<br><br>
deterioration) due to coke precipitation during the reaction is much greater in<br>
comparison with the zeolite-containing molded catalyst of the present invention.<br>
[0124] Thus, in comparison with previously proposed H-type zeolite catalysts, the<br>
zeolite-containing molded catalyst according to the present invention has much better<br>
water heat stability as a fine-particle zeolite. Consequently, it is possible to greatly<br>
control the conventional problems of regeneration degradation and coking<br>
deterioration, and produce aromatic hydrocarbon compounds stably and with high<br>
yield over a long period of time.<br>
