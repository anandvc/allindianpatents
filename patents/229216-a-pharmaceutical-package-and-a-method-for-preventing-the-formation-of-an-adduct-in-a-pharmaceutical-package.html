Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method and a package for packaging medical devices comprising a medicament. More particularly, it relates to a package and packaging method that utilizes an adsorbent material, such as a molecular sieve, that adsorbs or absorbs a gaseous substance that gradually accumulates in the inner local environment of an impermeable package, so as to prevent formation of adducts due to chemical reactions between the medicament in the medical device and the trace gaseous substance. Background of the Invention<br>
Medical devices usually need to be packed in a substantially impenneable packages to prevent atmospheric moisture ingress. The use of such impermeable packages may cause accumulation of certain trace substances within the sealed local environment to a level sufficient for them to interact with the medicament contained in the medical device. Such interaction, for example, may result in an adduct between the medicament and the trace substance. For instance, a dry powder inhaler generally       \ includes a number of plastic components molded from an acetyl homopolymer, and the plastic components may contain trace formaldehyde formed as a breakdown product during the molding of lacteal resins. It is believed that the trace formaldehye released from the plastic components is capable of forming an adduct with various medicaments when packaged within a substantially impenneable container.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art for an improvement In substantially impermeable medical device packages for preventing trace substances from interacting with the medicament in the medical device. Summary of the Invention<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide a new package for medical device comprising a medicament in which formation of adducts, such as medicament-polymer adducts, wilt be reduced or eliminated.<br>
This and other objects of the present invention are attained by providing a package comprising (i) an outer substantially Impermeable package; (ii) a medical device comprising a medicament that has a tendency to form adducts in the medicament; and (iii) an adsorbent material, preferably a molecular sieve. Both the<br><br>
medical device comprising a medicament and the adsorbent material are sealed within the package.<br>
It is believed that the mechanism by which the adsorbent material prevents adduct foliation is by entrapping residual gaseous substances released by various components of the medical device comprising a medicament so that those substances will not accumulate within the package to a significant level and interact with the medicament contained in the medical device to form the adducts. However, this explanation of the mechanism is not a limitation on the present Invention and an adsorbent material may achieve Its effect on adduct formation through other known or unknown mechanisms.<br>
The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, and specific objects attained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings and the following description in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the Invention.

It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Also, various features of the invention which are. for brevity, described in the context of a single emtTodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. The Problem of Adduct Formation<br>
During a feasibility study of a dry powder Inhaler (DPI) containing triamcinolone acetonide (TAA), an increasing level of the impurity from the synthesis, delta 14-TAA, was observed. This was first seen at the 6 week check point in samples stored at 40 C/75%RH and was observed to the greatest extent in the 100 μg/actuatlon DPI with a level of delta 14-TAA (0.48 % w/w) which failed the specification limit of 0.40 % w/w. After obtaining this out-of-specification result, a series of investigation were performed. Using an HPLC method, it is discovered that a new peak was present that eluted just before delta 14-TAA. It was further determined that in the original stability study, this new peak co-eluted with delta 14-TAA and thus gave rise to the out-of-specification reading of delta 14-TAA. When using the HPLC method, the delta 14-TAA level remained constant, as expected for an impurity from the synthesis. The new peak, detennined using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS), was found to be con-esponding to a mass of TAA plus 30, and had the same retention time as the product of the reaction between TAA and formaldehyde. Thus, It Is believed that the<br><br>
new peak was the adduct between TAA and fonnaldehyde, which was identified as the C11 hydroxymethyl derivative of TAA and was assigned Compound A with the following steucture:<br><br><br>
HOCH-O<br><br>
Compound A belongs to the glucocorticoid class of molecules, in which the class are known to possess anti-inflammatory activities and are commonly utilized for the treatment of numerous Inflammatory diseases, for example asthma. The effects of compounds in treating asthma can be examined by any one of the procedures known in the art. for example those disclosed in I.L Bemstein et al, Chest 81,20 (1982); K. Florey. Anal. Profiles Drug Subs. 1, 397-421 (1972); and D. H. Seih, Ibid. 11,615-649 (1982), which are incorporated herein by reference In their entirety.<br>
The term "medical device" as used herein is Intended to encompass any device that is capable of containing a medicament, wherein the device has a component that gradually releases a gaseous substance that may Interact with the medicament to form an adduct.

The term "package" as used herein is meant to encompass a container that Is substantially impermeable to moisture and to a gaseous substance released from a component of the device. For example, the package may be made of metal, glass, or plastic, and is selected from the group consisting of bottles, bags, drum boxes, and i^eguiarly shaped containers.<br>
In one embodiment, the package is a conventional flexible package and its manufacturing is well within the knowledge of the people skilled In the art. In general, the flexible package is constructed from flat reels of laminate which are folded or<br><br>
otherwise formed according to the packaging equipment technology Into a package by means of sealing and cutting. For example, as shown in figure 2, the package has a substantially impermeable flexible package 10, in which a dry powder inhaler 20 and a molecular sieve 30 enclosed in a porous sachet 40 are sealed. In this embodiment the package is constructed from a flat reel of flexible material which is curled around into a long tube and a seat 14 is fomied by heating (welding) the edges of the tube together. The cross seals 12 are formed by a straight heater bar which clamps the laminate tube before and after the package contents (i.e., the inhaler and the adsorbent sachet). It also cuts the continuous tube Into individual packs. As a result, there is a long continuous seal 14 down the middle of the pack and the cross seals 12 at both ends. Also, in figure 3, the package has a substantially impemeable flexible package 10, In which a dry powder inhaler 20 and adsorbent 30 are situated. The adsorbent 30 can molded as part of one of the plastic components, or could be provided in a container that is fixed to the Inhaler. In this embodiment the package is constructed from a fiat reel of flexible material which is curled around into a long tube and a seal 14 is formed by heating (welding) the edges of the tube together. The cross seals 12 are formed by a straight heater bar that clamps the laminate tube before and after the package contents. It also cuts the continuous tube Into individual packs. As a result, there is a long continuous seal 14 down the middle of the pack and the cross seals 12 at both ends.<br>
Other package types may include more or less seals according to the desired shape of the container, which may be flat seals or crimped, and may include gussets. The seals may be fomned by heating (welding) or by the use of pressure sensitive materials. In a further embodiment the flexible laminates may be formed using heat, pressure and/or vacuum into blisters or pockets to contain the product and which are then sealed by heating.<br>
Although a flexible package is preferred, other types of enclosures or containers may be suitable, whether flexible or inflexible, provided that the enclosure chosen is substantially impenmeabie to moisture ingress. In general, when the package or enclosure is impermeable, or substantially impemneabie, to moisture, it is also impemieable, or substantially impermeable, to the gaseous substance that has potential to interact with the medicament in the medical device.<br><br>
A prefen-ed flexible material for making the package is a laminate, although other materials may also be satisfactorily employed. The main limitation is that the package material must be substantially impenmeable to atmosphere moisture.<br>
The laminate used in making packages generally consists of several layers of materials either co-extruded or bonded together to form an apparently single film of •laminate". As an example, a suitable laminate may have three layers adhesively laminated to each other: an inner layer, a banier layer and an outer layer. For example, Pharmaflex Ltd., part of Alcan inc. (Cramlington, Northumberland, England) supplies a laminate film having three layers: 12 micron polyester/ 9 micron aluminum foil / 50 micron polyethylene (product catalog LMP-F BRI/72/H1).<br>
The inner layer fonns the inside of the package (in contact with the medk^al device) and is normally a thennoplastic layer and heat-sealable. A common material for the inner layer is polyethylene, but other polyolefinic or cyclo-olefinic materials may also be used, in addition, specialist materials such as lonomers are also frequently used for making the inner layer, for example, the ionomer under the tradename Suriyn.<br>
The barrier layer is situated between the inner and outer layers and provides Impermeability to the pack. Aluminum foil is commonly used for the banier layer, although any other metals capable of being rolled into thin sheets can also be satisfactorily used. A typical thickness for the aluminum foil layer is about 8 or 9 microns. Alternatively, the banier layer may be metallsed films, made up of tin, iron, zinc, magnesium or other metals coated by vacuum deposition or sputtering onto a polymeric sheet.<br>
The outer layer normally provides support, impact resistance, protection for the bamer layer and general robustness to the pack. A commonly used material for the outer layer is polyester, although other material, such as paper, may also be used. Most flexible laminate materials for packaging are commercially available. For example, Phamiaflex Ltd., part of Alcan inc. (Cramlington, Northumberiand, England) supplies a laminate film having three layers: 12 micron polyester / 9 micron aluminum foil / 50 micron polyethylene (product catalog LMP-F BRI/72/H1).<br>
The term "substantially Impermeable to the gaseous substance" as used herein, means that the level of the gaseous substance in the enclosed volume of the package or enclosure will elevate if no measure, such as inclusion of an adsorbent material<br><br>
within the package or enclosure, is taken to reduce it. Or in other words, the egress rate of the gaseous substance allowed by the package or enclosure is lower than the rate by which it is released into the enclosed volume of the package or enclosure by the medical device components.<br>
The present invention is intended to encompass the free acids, free bases, salts, amines and various hydrate forms including semi-hydrate forms of such medicaments and is particularly directed towards pharmaceuticatly acceptable formulations of such medicaments which are formulated in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable excipient materials generally known to those skilled in the art. preferably without other additives such as preservatives.<br>
The medicament may be in the form of a solid, such as a powder or a solid film, or In the fomri of a liquid, such as a watery, viscous, or paste-like material. The medicament may also be compounded with a variety of additives, such as surfactants or emulsifiers, and vehicles.<br>
Preferred medicament formulations do not include additional components such as preservatives which have a significant effect on the overall formulation. Thus preferred formulations consist essentially of phamaceutically active medicament and a phamnaceutlcally acceptable carrier (e.g., water and/or ethanol). However, if a medk:ament is liquid without an excipient the formulation may consist essentially of the medicament that has a sufficiently low viscosity that it can be aerosolized using a dispenser of the present invention.<br>
A prefen-ed medicament formulation consists essentially of a medicament, or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, optionally in combinafion with one or more other phannacologically active agents.<br>
Optionally, the fonnulations according to the invention may further comprise one or more cosolvent. A polar cosolvent such as C2.6 aliphatic alcohols and polyols, e.g.,<br>
glycerol, ethanol, isopropanol and propylene glycol, preferably ethanol, may be Included in the medicament formulation in the desired amount, either as the only excipient or in addition to other excipients, such as surfactants. Suitably, the medicament formulation may contain 0.01 to 5% wAv based on the propellent of a polar cosolvent, e.g., ethanol, preferably 0.1 to 5% w/w, e.g., about 0.1 to 1% w/w.<br><br>
Optionally, the fomiulations according to the invention may further comprise one or more surfactants. The surfactants must be physiologically acceptable upon administration by inhalation. Within this category are included surfactants such as oleic acid, sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan mono-oleate, sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate, polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate, natural lecithin, oleyl polyoxyethylene (2) ether, stearyl polyoxyethylene (2) ether, lauryl polyoxyethylene (4) ether, block copolymers of oxyethylene and oxypropylene, synthetic lecithin, diethylene glycol dioleate, tetrahydrofurfuryl oleate, ethyf oleate. isopropyl myristate, glyceryl monooleate, glyceyl monostearate, glyceryl monoriclnoleate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol 400, cetyl pyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, olive oil. glyceryl monolaurate, com oil, cotton seed oil and sunflower seed oil. Preferred surfactants are lecithin, oleic add and sorbitan trioleate. The amount of surfactant employed is desirably in the range of 0.0001% to 50% w/w ratio relative to the medicament, in particular 0.05 to 5% w/w ratio.<br>
Optionally, the formulations according to the invention may further comprise one or more stabilizers. The stabilizer is selected from the group consisting of glydn, glydne, alanine, valine, leucine, isoieuclne, methionine, threonine, Isovaline, phenylalanine, tyrosine, serine, histidine, tryptophan, proline, hydroxyproline. arginine, ornithine, asparaglne, citrulline, aspartic add. cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, l^ine, hydroxylysine, N-acefyl-L-cystelne, phenylalanine, trans-4-hydroxy-L-proHne, tyrosine, L-aspartyl-L-phenyialanine methylester and a mixture of any of the foregoing.<br>
Optionally, the formulations according to the invention may further comprise one or more antioxidants. The antioxidant may be selected from the group consisting of tocopherol, deteroxime mesylate, methyl paraben, ethyl paraben and ascorbic acid and mixtures thereof. A prefenred antioxidant is tocopherol.<br>
The tenm "adduct" as used herein is meant to encompass a compound that is fonfned by the reaction of the medicament with the undesired leakage of a gaseous substance from a component of the medical device. Examples of adducts include a medicament-polymer adduct and Compound A. There are at least two possible mechanisms by which the medicament-formaldehyde adduct Compound A is formed. The first possibility is that the medicament-formaldehyde reaction Is caused by direct contact between the medicament (TAA) and the plastic components of the DPI device<br><br>
that contain residual formaldehyde. The second possibility is that Compound A is formed from reaction between the medicament and gaseous formaldehyde in the inner local environment of the package, which has been released from the polyacetal components and accumulated in the local environment to a significant level due to the substantial impermeability of the package.<br>
The term "gaseous substance" as used herein is meant to encompass any gaseous substance that is gradually emitted from the device and is capable of reacting with the medicament in the device to form a product e.g. an adduct. An example of such a gaseous substance is fomiatdehyde gas.<br>
The term "adsorbenf as used herein is meant to encompass a substance which has the ability to condense or hold molecules of other substances on its surface or in its inner structure, an activity often referred as "adsorbing" or "absorbing". Examples of such adsort)ents include activated carbon, alumina, bauxite, charcoal, zeolites, silica gel, molecular sieves, activated clays, bauxite, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The present invention is not limited to any specific adsorbents. Although there are many different adsorbents and there are various trace gaseous substances, it is believed that any trace gaseous substance can be in principle entrapped by a properly-chosen adsorbent. Choosing a proper adsorbent for a given gaseous substance is well within the ordinary skill of the artisans in the field. They can make an initial choice based on their knowledge and experience (for example, weighing the factors such as the molecular size of the gaseous substance and the pore size of an adsorbent as well as electronic charges it canies) and then conduct tests to detennine the actual effectiveness, and the effective amount, of the chosen adsorbent against a given gaseous substance. They may need to repeat the process until a proper adsorbent is found. One of the tests for finding an effective adsorioent against adduct formation is described herein and can be adopted by people skilled in the art to detennine the actual effectiveness of any adsorbent, cun-ently existing or to be developed in the future, against fonnation of medicament-adducts caused by any gaseous substances.<br>
For preventing adduct fonnation caused by gaseous formaldehyde in medical devices comprising a medicament. Applicants have found that the most effective adsorbent material is molecular sieve with a pore size of about 10 Angstroms. Inclusion of 1 to 10 grams of the molecular sieve for example that supplied by AtoFina (Solihull,<br><br>
England) under the trade name Siliporlte Is found sufficient per packa^ to prevent formation of medicament-polymer adducts In medical devices containing 5.8 mg/g TAA/lactose blend. More detailed technical infomiation about molecular sieves and their other industrial uses can be found in the Hajdu article: Molecular Selves: Unique Moisture and Odor-Taste Control Material, D. Hajdu, T.J. Dangieri and S.R. Dunne, TAPPI Polym.. Laminations Coat. Conf. (1999), Vol. 2. p. 655-662.<br>
There are numerous ways In which the absorbent material can be present in the phamnaceutlcal product. For example, the adsorbent can be incorporated into a polymer mixture and manufactured into a plastic component of the medical device. Also, the adsorbent can be Incorporated into a polymer mixture and manufactured Into plastic sheeting used in the packaging of the device. The adsorbent can be Incorporated into a polymer mixture in the same, or similar, manner as desiccant polymer mixtures disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5911937, 3245946,4013566,4407897, 4425410,4464443 5078909 and 4792484. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Although these patents disclose desiccants. It is foreseeable that the methods of manufacturing these plastics could be used to use to manufacture the adsorbent material used in the present invention. The adsorbent can also be in the fomn of an adsorbent incorporated in an adhesive (e.g. a self-adhesive patch or tape). In the same, or similar, manner as adhesive desiccants disclosed in US Patent No. 6103141, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The adsorbent material of the invention can also be in the form of an adsorbent in a porous sachet. Although it is not necessary to have a sachet to contain the adsorbent within the package, it is usually preferred. The adsorbent sachets are commercially available from many suppliers including Sud-Chemie (MIddlewich. England). The sachet, with a "tea-bag" like appearance, is generally manufactured from synthetic fibers, such as polyamlde or polyester fibers or blends thereof. Commercially available materials suitable for making adsorbent sachets include, for example, GDT-II from San-ei Corporation (Osaka, Japan) and Tyvek from Perfecseal (Londonderry N.Ireland U.K.). However, a suitable sachet may be In other convenient shapes or appearances and made from other penneable materials. Examples of adsorbents are selected from the group consisting of molecular sieves, activated clays, activated alumina, silica, zeolites, bauxites, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, 10 A (Angstrom)<br><br>
molecular sieves. Molecular sieve material is commercially avaiiaoie trom several manufacturers. For example AtoFlna (Solihull, England) market a molecular sieve under the trade name of Siliporlte. More detailed technical information about molecular sieves and their other industrial uses can be found in the Molecular Selves: Unique Moisture and Odor-Taste Control Material", D. Hajdu, T.J. Dangieri and S.R. Dunne, TAPPI Polym.. Laminations Coat Conf. (1999), Vol. 2, p. 655-662, which is Incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
The term "effective amount of an adsorbenr as used herein is intended to encompass the amount of an adsorbent material that is necessary to be effective in reducing fomiation of medicament adducts. The effective amount of adsorbent will depend on a number of factors, including the type of adsorbent and gas, the moisture content of the pharmaceutical product, and the amount of gaseous substance released. A person skilled in the art would readily be able to detemnlne the effective amount of the adsorbent.<br>
Due to the variety of forms in which the adsort&gt;ent can t&gt;e present in the<br>
invention, the adsorbent can also be situated In a variety of places within the<br>
pharmaceutical product. For example, the adsorbent can t&gt;e within a cavity in the	&gt;<br>
medical device (i.e. housed In the device) e.g. the adsorbent can be situated inside the cap or inside the body of a dry-powder inhaler (see figure 3). Also, the adsorbent can be a component of the device e.g. the cap of a dry-powder inhaler can comprise an adsorbent polymer mixture (see figure 3). Also, the adsorbent can be affixed to the device in the form of an adhesive sticker/tape comprising the adsorbent. Furthermore, the adsorbent can be separate from the device in an enclosed volume within which the device is situated (see figure 2).<br>
While there have been described and pointed out fundamental novel features of the Invention as applied to a preferred embodiment thereof, It will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes, in the form and details of the packages, adsorbents, phamnaceutical products and methods illustrated, may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the Invention. For example, it is expressly intended that all combinations of those elements and/or method steps which perfonm substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve the same results are within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
Process of Finding an Effective Adsorbent against Adduct Formation<br>
A study has been performed to determine an effective adsorbent against adduct formation, the result of which is summarized In figure 1. It showed that the adduct Compound A is formed not because of the direct contact between the medicament and the plastic components, but primarily because of the gaseous formaldehyde released from the plastic components and accumulated within the substantial impemrieable local package environment. It further showed that the molecular sieve is an effective adsorbent in preventing the fonmation of Compound A.<br>
The study was conducted in two groups: the contact group and non-contact group.<br>
In the contact group, twenty-seven (27) samples were used, each comprising a dry-powder inhaler (DPI) sub assembly device core, assembled with only the upper mandrel and the powder chamber. The powder chambers were filled with 5.8 mg/g TAA/lactose blend. The samples were packaged with a laminated foil package, which provides a substantial Impermeable enclosure. Thirteen (13) of the samples were packaged along with a molecular sieve as an adsorbent and the rest fourteen (14) samples did not include any adsorbent. The samples were stored at 40 °C/75%RH for 24 weeks. The blend from the power chamber was tested for the Compound A content and the adduct profile obtained initially and after storage for 1,2,3,4,6,8 and 24 weeks is shown In figure 1.<br>
in the non-contact group, twenty-seven (27) samples were used. In each sample, a powder chamber filled with 5.8 mg/g TAA/lactose blend was contained in a breathable Tyvek bag and then placed in a seated laminated foil package. Also placed in the sealed package was a polyacetal upper mandrel of the DPI sub assembly device core. Thus, the mandrel was in close proximity but not In direct contact with the blend itself. Of the samples, thirteen(13) Included a molecular sieve within the seated package and the remaining fourteen(14) did not. The samples were stored at 40 *'C/75%RH for 24 weeks. The blend from the powder chamber was tested for the Compound A content and the adduct profile obtained initially and after storage for 1.2,3.4.6,8 and 24 weeks are shown in figure 1.<br>
The above study result demonstrates that inclusion of an adsorbent inside the impermeable package is a simple and effective solution to the problem of medicament-<br><br>
I<br><br>
polymer adduct formation occurred when medical devices comprising a medicament are packaged in impermeable packages. Particularly, molecular sieves are effective adsorbent materials against adduct formation caused by gaseous formaldehyde.<br>
Although there are various types of adsorbent materials available and their effectiveness against any given gaseous substance varies considerably, it is understood that people of ordinary skill in the art can easily adopt the above-described study to determine the type and the amount of an adsorbent material that is effective in reducing formation of medicament adducts for any other types medical devices containing other different medicaments.<br>
