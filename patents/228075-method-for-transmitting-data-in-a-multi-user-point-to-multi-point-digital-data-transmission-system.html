				<td>Method For Transmitting Data In A Multi-User, Point To Multi-<br>
Point Digital Data Transmission System<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for transmitting data in a multi-user,<br>
point to multi-point digital data transmission system and generally applies to<br>
various user modems (1) in two-way communication over a physical medium<br>
(6). The process allows multiple transmissions of information at various speeds<br>
between a user modem (la) and numerous addressee user modems (lb-Id)<br>
while maintaining the values for bandwidth and maximum latency required by<br>
each of the addressee user modems (1 b-1 d).<br>
The process comprises the sending of various frames<br>
(4) of information from a modem (la) to numerous<br>
addressee user modems (1b-1d) at various speeds and<br>
furthermore achieves quality of service per user modem by<br>
reserving a percentage of the frame and it provides a<br>
criterion to dynamically assign the packets sent to each<br>
user modem in the frame, by grouping or dividing the<br>
packets to be sent.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The current invention, as suggested in the title,<br>
consists of a process for the transmission of data by a<br>
multi-user, point to multi-point digital data<br>
transmission system. The process refers to the means of<br>
carrying out access control in the transmission medium in<br>
the downstream channel, that is to say, the manner by<br>
which transmission is carried out from a user modem to<br>
numerous other user modems.<br>
The principal objective of the process in this<br>
invention is to maximize transmission capacity by means<br>
of distributing the bandwidth available in the physical<br>
medium between the different user modems to whom it is<br>
transmitted according to the maximum latency requirements<br>
established by each one of the user modems.<br>
The technical field of the invention is the<br>
telecommunications sector, and more specifically two-way<br><br>
communications between various users using any<br>
transmission means.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of point to multi-point systems, where<br>
various modems send information to each other using the<br>
same physical medium, is known in the prior art. The main<br>
problem in these systems is that unless the transmission<br>
network is symmetrical for each user, something that is<br>
unlikely to occur in reality, the user modems receivers<br>
will not be able to receive information from the various<br>
transmitters at equal levels of quality due to the fact<br>
that attenuation and channel noise in the downstream (the<br>
channel that runs from a user modem transmitter to the<br>
receiver in another user modem) depends on which<br>
transmitter and receiver are involved in each case and<br>
the behaviour of the channel at each moment.<br>
This problem makes it very difficult to maintain<br>
both the bandwidth requirements and the maximum latency<br>
necessary to be able to transmit different types of<br>
traffic in the point to multi-point systems available to<br>
date.<br>
Furthermore, in cases where the transmission medium<br>
response in time is variable rather than fixed, as is the<br>
case of low voltage electricity networks or mobile<br>
networks, this technical problem becomes more important<br>
due to the need to modify the configuration of the<br>
communication so as to be able to maintain the<br>
requirements for latency and bandwidth at all times.<br>
The current invention solves this technical problem,<br>
allowing said quality of service requirements (bandwidth<br>
and maximum latency) to be maintained independently of<br>
the characteristics of the physical medium and the<br>
communication.<br>
Other systems that allow the inclusion of quality of<br>
service (QoS) in a communication exist in the prior art.<br><br>
In this context mention must be made of the Spanish Patent submission<br>
No.200003024 (corresponding to Indian Patent Application<br>
No.895/KOLNP/2003) concerning a "POINT TO MULTIPOINT SYSTEM<br>
AND PROCESS FOR THE TRANSMISSION OVER THE ELECTRICITY<br>
NETWORK OF DIGITAL DATA", as well as Spanish Patent submission<br>
No.200100916 (corresponding to Indian Patent Application<br>
NO.133/KOLNP/2003 concerning a "PROCESS FOR MULTIPLE ACCESS<br>
AND MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION OF DATA IN A MULTI-USER<br>
SYSTEM FOR THE POINT TO MULTIPOINT DIGITAL TRANSMISSION<br>
OF DATA OVER THE ELECTRICITY NETWORK", both of which present a<br>
solution for the inclusion of quality of service (QoS) for communication<br>
point to multi-point over the electricity network, and<br>
where a single transmitter (the head-end modem)<br>
communicates with various users (user modems). The<br>
process in the present invention improves this process to<br>
allow the inclusion of quality of service (in terms of<br>
bandwidth and maximum latency) in point to multi-point<br>
communications, so that any user modem may transmit<br>
information to any other user and the communication is<br>
not limited to a variable time medium such as the low<br>
voltage electricity network but can also be employed in<br>
any other transmission medium used as a communications<br>
channel in point to multi-point transmissions.<br>
Another relevant background art can be found in<br>
document EP-0973-290-A2, which relates to multiplexing<br>
data packets in a data service channel with data in one<br>
or more digital video signals channels to form a<br>
multiplexed output signal. The data in the data service<br>
channel may include control data, conditional access<br>
data, electronic program guides, paged data services,<br>
service information, broadcast internet information, and<br>
business information such as financial share information.<br>
The data packets each comprise a time stamp indicating a<br>
requested delivery time and the data packets are sorted<br>
into a queue in time stamp order. The urgency of the data<br>
service channel is calculated as a function of the queue<br><br>
length and requested delivery times. The share of the bit<br>
rate of the multiplexed output signal allocated to the<br>
data service channel is varied according to its urgency.<br>
An error value is calculated for each data packet to<br>
represent the error between the expected delivery time<br>
and the requested delivery time to the head of the queue<br>
and the urgency of the data channel is derived as an<br>
average of the error values. The average may be a<br>
weighted average.<br>
Therefore, the present invention presents a process<br>
that maintains said requirements including when<br>
attenuation, noise and channel response vary dynamically<br>
not only in frequency but also in time for each user<br>
modem.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
To achieve the objectives and avoid the<br>
inconveniences indicated in the previous paragraphs, this<br>
invention as claimed has developed a new process for the<br>
transmission of data in the downstream of a multi-user,<br>
point to multi-point, digital data transmission system<br>
where various user modems are in two-way communication<br>
over a physical medium. The downstream channel is that<br>
which is used by a user modem to transmit information to<br>
a series of user modem that receives the information and<br>
the upstream channel is by definition, the opposite.<br>
The process described in this invention is<br>
characterized because it comprises transmission of<br>
information at different speeds to different user modems<br>
using the same physical medium; because time division in<br>
the downstream channel adaptable to the different<br>
transmission speeds and the different users is carried<br>
out, because packet size is optimised to the means of<br>
communication, and this size may be different to that<br>
used in the upper layers of the communication by the<br>
transmitter; and because packets with different<br><br>
priorities for user modems or groups of user modems are<br>
transmitted by means of reservation of channel time based<br>
on the quality required by these.<br>
All these characteristics allows to guarantee a<br>
determined bandwidth and a determined maximum latency for<br>
the various users in the downstream channel, delivering<br>
quality of service (QoS) for the communication traffic<br>
based on different bandwidth requirements and latency for<br>
different user modems.<br>
To carry out time division in the downstream channel<br>
that is adaptable to the transmission speeds of the<br>
various users, all the packets sent by the physical<br>
medium must occupy the same channel time but at different<br>
lengths, since the information is transmitted at<br>
different speeds and these transmission speeds depend of<br>
the number of bits per symbol to be used by each user<br>
modem. The length of the packets sent may be less or<br>
equal to a fixed maximum (in number of bits).<br>
In order that the packets occupy the same channel<br>
time, the number of symbols for each packet is fixed in<br>
what is conventionally called the Maximum Tranfer Unit<br>
(MTU) in the transmitter. This number of symbols is<br>
adjusted to a value that is adequate to reach a<br>
compromise between efficiency in the transmission of bits<br>
per second and quality of service in terms of latency.<br>
The process allows different types of traffic from the<br>
unit used for transmitting packets (MTU). Among the<br>
various types of traffic allowed is traffic without<br>
minimum latency and bandwidth requirements, traffic with<br>
constant bit rates (CBR), traffic with variable bit rates<br>
(VBR), and traffic with reserved bandwidth and fixed<br>
maximum latency.<br>
Due to the fact that the number of symbols sent is a<br>
fixed number per packet, the packets that must be sent to<br>
the various users are grouped and/or divided in the<br><br>
transmitter. In this way, packet size is fixed to the<br>
number of symbols in the unit used for transmission, the<br>
Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU).<br>
Due to the fact that the duration of the symbols is<br>
fixed and always the same, the number of symbols for each<br>
packet sent is also fixed.<br>
The downstream channel is divided into a series of<br>
frames with a fixed number of packets. In these frames<br>
different percentages of packets to be sent to the<br>
addressee user groups are reserved. Each user group<br>
contains users who share the same quality of service<br>
requirements for their traffic, this quality being<br>
reserved bandwidth and/or maximum latency.<br>
If the percentage reserved for a user or group of<br>
addressee users is not used, this percentage may be<br>
distributed between the remaining modems or groups of<br>
user modems that will transmit information. This is<br>
carried out according to a determined configuration of<br>
traffic to be transmitted.<br>
In the percentage reserved for packets in the frame<br>
by each user group, each user in the group has a certain<br>
percentage according to its own quality of service<br>
depending on whether it has reserved bandwidth and/or<br>
maximum latency requirements.<br>
The process of the invention includes storing of<br>
packets to be transmitted to different users in a series<br>
of queues in the transmitter. These transmission queues<br>
are queues per user where the packets are ordered<br>
according to priority, said priority being fixed by an<br>
upper protocol. Having the packets stored in such queues<br>
allows the extraction of packets ordered according to<br>
priority. Therefore, the transmitter groups packets and<br>
decides on not only which is the next packet to be<br>
transmitted, but to whom, and the size of that packet.<br>
The following drawings are provided to facilitate a<br><br>
better understanding of the present invention and while<br>
forming an integral part of the detailed description and<br>
the claims, they offer an illustrative but not limited<br>
representation of the principles of this invention.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hereafter follows a description of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, making reference to the<br>
numeration used in the Figures.<br>
This example concerns a digital transmission system<br>
for the two-way transmission of data point to multi-<br>
point, and where therefore there are numerous user modems<br>
1.<br>
The example in Figure 1 shows a series of user<br>
modems 1 in a building 2 and a user group 1 in the<br>
building 3.<br>
Since the invention is applicable to the downstream<br>
channel, Figure 2 shows a user modem la transmitting data<br>
to three user modems 1a-1d with different speeds vi, vi+1,<br>
and vi+2.<br>
The speed vi, is the number of bits per second that<br>
can be sent from the transmitter la to the user modem 1b-<br>
1d.<br><br>
The transmitter takes charge of assigning<br>
communication bandwidth over the physical medium 6 by<br>
means of an arbiter unit as will be mention later.<br>
In a point to multi-point system with different<br>
transmission speeds the need to define quality of service<br>
that ensures differing efficient latencies for different<br>
users is considered.<br>
The transmission speed for each user modem may be<br>
very different. For example in an "OFDM" (orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing) communication system,<br>
the speed depends on the number of bits per carrier, and<br>
this last value depends on the quality of certain channel<br>
parameters in this carrier.<br>
In this communication system, for example, if a user<br>
modem 1b is much closer to the transmitter la than<br>
another modem 1d, giving a more optimistic bit<br>
configuration per carrier to the modem 1b than to the<br>
modem 1d in each OFDM symbol, more bits can be sent to<br>
the nearest rather than the furthest away user, without<br>
loss of quality, due to the fact that attenuation is<br>
less.<br>
In a traditional system, where the speed that<br>
unites the origin with all the addressees is the same, a<br>
maximum number of bytes (MTU) for all packets that will<br>
be transmitted is fixed. Therefore, each packet occupies<br>
the same channel time and it can be guaranteed that the<br>
reception latencies for all the remote users will not<br>
surpass a certain value. On the contrary in a system<br>
where each addressee has a different speed, if there is<br>
the same MTU for all addressees the channel time that the<br>
packets will use depends on the speed, so latencies<br>
cannot be guaranteed.<br>
The process of this invention sets the channel time<br>
to be equal for all the addressee modems, independently<br>
of the speed in each channel. Therefore transmission to<br><br>
each addressee modem 1b-1d has a maximum number of bytes<br>
(MTU), that will be different for each modem.<br>
Consider the example in Figure 2, where two user<br>
modems 1b and 1c are selected, and where lb is further<br>
away from the modem 1a than the modem 1c. Consider that<br>
there are speeds vi and vi+1 associated to communications<br>
1a to 1b and 1a to 1c respectively (where vi is greater<br>
than vi+1) . Taking into account that in an OFDM<br>
communication system the speeds vx and vi+1 are translated<br>
into number of bits per carrier, then in each OFDM symbol<br>
one can introduce and send N1 bits for the modem 1b and N2<br>
bits for the modem lc, since the time that each symbol<br>
lasts is known and it is the same for each addressee<br>
modem.<br>
In this example, each packet at a maximum occupies N<br>
number of OFDM symbols. Therefore, the channel time for<br>
each packet is controlled and it can be calculated that<br>
the MTU for modem 1b is N1*N and the MTU for modem lc is<br>
N2*N, guaranteeing the latencies for all the user modems<br>
to whom they transmit information.<br>
Another problem that is found in a multipoint<br>
configuration where each addressee has a different speed<br>
is the need to guarantee reception bandwidth in the<br>
different addressee user modems 1b-1d. To achieve this,<br>
the channel is divided in time. For example, in and OFDM<br>
communication system the number of symbols are grouped in<br>
frames 4. The definition of each frame is carried out<br>
taking into account the bandwidth that it is wished to<br>
reserve for each user modem 1b-1d.<br>
For example, taking the configuration presented<br>
previously in Figure 2, it is possible to reserve 80% of<br>
the bandwidth for the modem lb and the remaining 20% for<br>
the modem 1c. This scenario is demonstrated in Figure 3.<br>
The transmitter uses an arbiter unit to determine to<br>
which addressee modem the current packet should be<br><br>
transmitted.<br>
Taking into account that the channel is divided into<br>
frames 4 and that each packet occupies the same channel<br>
time, the channel can be divided into packets 5, thus<br>
facilitating the functioning of the arbiter.<br>
The arbiter must decide, at each moment, which<br>
packet must be transmitted. In the previous example the<br>
modem 1b has 80% reserved and the modem 1c 20%, this<br>
reserve implies that the transmitter had to send P1<br>
packets to the user modem 1b where P1 is 80% of the frame<br>
4 and P2 packets for the user 1c here P2 is 20% of the<br>
packets in the frame 4.<br>
In this situation, the arbiter decides at each<br>
moment which packet to transmit taking into account that<br>
of the P packets in the frame, the percentage P1 must be<br>
the percentage of packets for the user of modem 1b and P2<br>
the percentage of packets for the user of modem 1c.<br>
The packets that will be sent to each user modem are<br>
stored in the transmitter 1a. In the management of these<br>
stored packets, one must take into account that for each<br>
addressee user there are a number of stored packets and<br>
the transmission order of these packets for each user is<br>
carried out according to packet priority and if there are<br>
two packets with the same priority then these are sent by<br>
order of arrival (from the oldest to the most recent).<br>
For example, a possible implementation of this<br>
storing could occur in a FIFO (first in, first out)<br>
memory for each user, address and priority. When the<br>
arbiter decides which user to transmit to, it selects the<br>
packet to transmit taking in to account the priorities.<br>
The concepts of reserved bandwidth and maximum<br>
latency unite to offer different qualities of service.<br>
For this, every time that a packet can be sent, the user<br>
to receive the packet is identified and furthermore, the<br>
maximum length that this packet can have (MTU) is<br><br>
calculated. Taking the MTU and the addressee into<br>
account, the packets are extracted from the queues<br>
according to the priorities of the packets, and then they<br>
are aggregated. To construct the packet with the maximum<br>
length, not only are packets joined, but they are also<br>
divided to adjust to the maximum length (MTU) calculated<br>
for this addressee user modem.<br>
The users are grouped depending on the quality of<br>
service required. A group of users without quality of<br>
service requirement also exists, that is, they do not<br>
require bandwidth or maximum latency. The packets for<br>
users without quality of service requirements enter in a<br>
frame in a moment when the arbiter has no packets to send<br>
to the users that require quality of service.<br>
For example, in a situation with three user modems<br>
1b-1d, where 1b has 80% reserved and the modem 1c has 20%<br>
reserved, then 1d has 0% reserved. The arbiter always<br>
sends packets to the modems 1b and 1c and in the case that<br>
it does not have packets for these user modems, it sends<br>
data to the modem 1d. The user modem 1d has a channel<br>
speed of vi+2 and therefore it has a MTU that does not<br>
affect the latencies of the users profile (in this example<br>
1b and 1c).<br>
In particular, the users are divided into two<br>
principal groups, one group with a percentage of reserved<br>
bandwidth (type A) and the other without any reserved<br>
percentage (type B) . The arbiter gives priority to type<br>
A. The possibility of considering a percentage of reserved<br>
bandwidth for all type B exists, thereby guaranteeing that<br>
all the type B users will have very low bandwidth but will<br>
receive packets. A third option consists of considering<br>
all the type B users globally as one extra type A user.<br>
On the other hand, data packets on the line include a<br>
header that occupies certain channel time. The process<br>
proposed optimises the time applied to headers with<br><br>
respect to the time used in the channel for the<br>
transmission of data, arriving at an efficient compromise<br>
between the time needed for headers and the time used for<br>
the transmission of data.<br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION<br>
SYSTEM, where various user modems (1) are in two-way<br>
communication over a physical medium (6), a<br>
downstream channel being the channel used in the<br>
communication between a user modem (1a) and numerous<br>
addressee user modems (1b-1d), and an upstream<br>
channel being that used in the communication to this<br>
specific user modem (from 1b-1d to 1a) ; wherein the<br>
method comprises:<br>
- carrying out the transmission of information at<br>
various speeds to various addressee user modems<br>
over the same physical medium (6);<br>
- carrying out time division in the down-stream<br>
channel adaptable to the different transmission<br>
speeds of the different addressee user modems<br>
(1b-1c);<br>
- optimizing a size of a packet to be transmitted<br>
over the physical medium (6) , so that this packet<br>
size may be different to that used the upper<br>
communication layers of the transmitter (la);<br>
- carrying out packet transmission with different<br>
priorities by means of reservation of channel<br>
time based on a quality required by the addressee<br>
user modems or groups of addressee user modems;<br>
- dividing the downstream link in a series of<br>
frames (4) containing a fixed number of packets<br>
(5) , all packets occupying the same channel time<br>
,and where various percentages of the packets sent<br>
in the same frame are reserved for the various<br>
groups of addressee user modems that share the<br>
same quality of service, in terms of criteria<br>
selected from reserved bandwidth, maximum latency<br>
and combinations thereof;<br><br>
all of which in order to guarantee a fixed bandwidth and<br>
a fixed maximum latency for the various addressee user<br>
modems in the downstream channel, and adapting quality of<br>
services (QoS) for a communication traffic to different<br>
requests for bandwidth and latency.<br>
2.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 1, wherein time division in the<br>
downstream channel that is adaptable to the different<br>
transmission speeds of the different addressee user<br>
modems is undertaken by sending packets of different<br>
length in a same channel time, so that information is<br>
transmitted at different speeds, depending on a number of<br>
usable bits per symbol for each one of the addressee user<br>
modems by means of packets with a maximum length fixed in<br>
number of bits.<br>
3.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 2, wherein to occupy the same channel<br>
time a number of symbols to be sent in a packet<br>
transmission unit (Maximum Transfer Unit or MTU) of the<br>
transmitter (1a) is fixed, said number being adjusted to<br>
reach a compromise between transmission efficiency in<br>
bits per second and quality of service in terms of<br>
latency, in order to allow selectively different types of<br>
traffic selected from traffic without minimum latency and<br>
bandwidth requirements, traffic with constant bit rates<br>
(CBR), traffic with variable bit rates (VBR) and traffic<br>
with reserved bandwidth and fixed maximum latency.<br>
4.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 3, wherein the packets that must be sent<br>
to the various addressee user modems are grouped and/or<br>
divided in the transmitter so that they occupy the size<br>
fixed in number of symbols in the Maximum Transfer Unit<br>
(MTU).<br><br>
5.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 1, wherein if an addressee user modem or<br>
group of addressee user modems do not use the percentage<br>
reserved for them, said percentage is divided between the<br>
rest of the modems or groups of modems to whom<br>
information is being transmitted, in function of a<br>
determined configuration of selected traffic.<br>
6.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 1, wherein within the percentage of<br>
packets in the frame reserved for a group of addressee<br>
user modems, each modem has its own percentage of packets<br>
depending on the quality of service requirements in terms<br>
of a criteria selected from reserved bandwidth, maximum<br>
latency and combinations thereof.<br>
7.- METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING DATA IN A MULTI-USER,<br>
POINT TO MULTI-POINT DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, as<br>
claimed in Claim 1, wherein the packets that must be<br>
transmitted are stored in user queues ordered by<br>
priority, where these priorities are fixed by a higher<br>
layer protocol to allow extraction of the packets ordered<br>
according to a priority established, so that the<br>
transmitter groups packets and determines which is the<br>
next packet to be sent, to which user and the size of<br>
that packet.<br><br>
The invention relates to a data transmission method for a multi-user, multi-point-to-multipoint<br>
digital data transmission system involving a plurality of pieces of user<br>
equipment (1) which are bidirectionallyconnected via a physical means (6). the<br>
inventive method can be used to establish various communications from a piece of<br>
user equipment (1a) to different pieces of destination user equipment(1b-1d) at<br>
different speeds, while maintaining the bandwidth and maximum latency values<br>
required by each of the pieces of destination user equipment (1b-1d). Said method<br>
consists in sending multiple information frames (4) from a piece of equipment (1a) to<br>
a multiple pieces of destination user equipment (1b-1d) at different speeds.<br>
Moreover, using the percentage reserve of the frame, the invention provides a<br>
quality of service based on that required by the piece of user equipment and supplies<br>
a criterion for dynamically assigning the packets which are sent to each piece of user<br>
equipment in the frame, grouping or dividing the packets to be sent.</td>
