BORON-CONTAINING MOLECULAR SIEVE CHA<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Chabazite, which has the crystal structure designated "CHA", is a natural zeolite with the approximate formula Ca6AI12Si24072. Synthetic forms of chabazite are described in "Zeolite Molecular Sieves" by D. W. Breck, published in 1973 by John Wiley &amp; Sons. The synthetic forms reported by Breck are: zeolite "K-G", described in J. Chem. SocM p. 2822 (1956), Barrer et al.; zeolite D, described in British Patent No. 868,846 (1961); and zeolite R, described in U. S. Patent No. 3,030,181, issued April 17,1962 to Milton et al. Chabazite is also discussed in "Atlas of Zeolite Structure Types" (1978) by W. H. Meier and D. H. Olson.<br>
The K-G zeolite material reported in the J. Chem. Soc. Article by Barrer et al. is a potassium form having a silica:alumina mole ratio (referred to herein as "SAR") of 2.3:1 to 4.15:1. Zeolite D reported in British Patent No. 868,846 is a sodium-potassium form having a SAR of 4.5:1 to 4.9:1. Zeolite R reported in U. S. Patent No. 3,030,181 is a sodium form which has a SAR of 3.45:1 to 3.65:1.<br>
Citation No. 93:66052y in Volume 93 (1980) of Chemical Abstracts concerns a Russian language article by Tsitsishrili et al. in Soobsch. Akad. Nauk. Gruz. SSR 1980, 97(3) 621-4. This article teaches that the presence of tetramethylammonium ions in a reaction mixture containing K20-Na20-Si02-AI2O3-H2O promotes the crystallization of chabazite. The zeolite obtained by the crystallization procedure has a SAR of 4.23.<br>
The molecular sieve designated SSZ-13, which has the CHA crystal structure, is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,544,538, issued October 1, 1985 to Zones. SSZ-13 is prepared from nitrogen-containing cations derived from 1-adamantamine, 3-quinuciidinol and 2-exo-aminonorbomane. Zones discloses that the SSZ-13 of U. S. Patent No. 4,544,538 has a composition, as-synthesized and in the anhydrous state, in terms of mole ratios of oxides as follows:<br>
(0.5 to 1.4)R20 : (0 to 0.5)M2O : W203 : (greater than 5)Y02<br><br>
.wherein M is an alkali metal cation, W is selected from aluminum, gallium and mixtures thereof, Y is selected from silicon, germanium and mixtures thereof, and R is an organic cation. U. S. Patent No. 4,544,538 does not, however, disclose boron-containing SSZ-13.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 6,709,644, issued March 23, 2004 to Zones et al.f discloses zeolites having the CHA crystal structure and having small crystallite sizes. It does not, however, disclose a CHA zeolite containing boron. It is disclosed that the zeolite can be used for separation of gasses (e.g., separating carbon dioxide from natural gas), and in catalysts used for the reduction of oxides of nitrogen in a gas stream (e.g., automotive exhaust), converting lower alcohols and other oxygenated hydrocarbons to liquid products, and for producing dimethylamine.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to molecular sieves having the CHA crystal structure and containing boron in their crystal framework.<br><br>
Boron-containing CHA molecular sieves can be suitably prepared from an aqueous reaction mixture containing sources of sources of an oxide of silicon; sources of boron oxide or a combination of boron oxide and aluminum oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, gallium oxide and mixtures thereof; optionally sources of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal oxide; and a cation derived from 1-adamantamine, 3-quinuclidinol or 2-exo-aminonorbomane. The mixture should have a composition in terms of mole ratios falling within the ranges shown in Table A below:<br>
TABLE A<br>
Y02/WaOb	&gt;2-2,000<br>
OH-/YO2	0.2 - 0.45<br>
Q/YO2	0.2 - 0.45<br>
M2/nO/Y02	0-0.25<br>
H20/Y02	22 - 80<br>
wherein Y is silicon; W is boron or a combination of boron and aluminum, iron, titanium, gallium and mixtures thereof; M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal; n is the valence of M (i.e., 1 or 2) and Q is a quaternary ammonium cation derived from 1-adamantamine, 3-quinuclidinol or 2-exo-aminonorbomane (commonly known as a structure directing agent or "SDA").<br>
The quaternary ammonium cation derived from 1-adamantamine can be a N,N,N-trialkyl-1-adamantammonium cation which has the formula:<br><br>
where R1, R2, and R3 are each independently a lower alkyl, for example methyl. The cation is associated with an anion, A", which is not detrimental to<br><br>
the formation of the molecular sieve. Representative of such anions include halogens, such as fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide; hydroxide; acetate; sulfate and carboxylate. Hydroxide is the preferred anion. It may be beneficial to ion exchange, for example, a halide for hydroxide ion, thereby reducing or eliminating the alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide required.<br>
The quaternary ammonium cation derived from 3-quinuclidinol can have the formula:<br><br>
where R1, R2, R3 and A are as defined above.<br>
The reaction mixture is prepared using standard molecular sieve preparation techniques. Typical sources of silicon oxide include fumed silica, silicates, silica hydrogel, silicic acid , colloidal silica, tetra-alkyl orthosilicates, and silica hydroxides. Sources of boron oxide include borosilicate glasses and other reactive boron compounds. These include borates, boric acid and borate esters. Typical sources of aluminum oxide include aluminates, alumina, hydrated aluminum hydroxides, and aluminum compounds such as AICI3 and AI2(S04)3. Sources of other oxides are analogous to those for silicon oxide, boron oxide and aluminum oxide.<br>
It has been found that seeding the reaction mixture with CHA crystals both directs and accelerates the crystallization, as well as minimizing the formation of undesired contaminants. In order to produce pure phase boron-containing CHA crystals, seeding may be required. When seeds are used,<br><br>
, they can be used in an amount that is about 2-3 weight percent based on the weight of YO2.<br>
The reaction mixture is maintained at an elevated temperature until CHA crystals are formed. The temperatures during the hydrothermal crystallization step are typically maintained from about 120°C to about 160°C. It has been found that a temperature below 160°C, e.g., about 120°C to about 140°C, is useful for producing boron-containing CHA crystals without the formation of secondary crystal phases.<br>
The crystallization period is typically greater than 1 day and preferably from about 3 days to about 7 days. The hydrothermal crystallization is conducted under pressure and usually in an autoclave so that the reaction mixture is subject to autogenous pressure. The reaction mixture can be stirred, such as by rotating the reaction vessel, during crystallization.<br>
Once the boron-containing CHA crystals have formed, the solid product is separated from the reaction mixture by standard mechanical separation techniques such as filtration. The crystals are water-washed and then dried, e.g., at 90°C to 150°C for from 8 to 24 hours, to obtain the as-synthesized crystals. The drying step can be performed at atmospheric or subatmospheric pressures.<br>
The boron-containing CHA molecular sieve has a composition, as-synthesized and in the anhydrous state, in terms of mole ratios of oxides as indicated in Table B below:<br>
As-Synthesized Boron-containing CHA Composition<br>
TABLE B<br>
Y02/WcOd     20-2,000<br>
M2/nO/Y02     0 - 0.03<br>
Q/YO2	0.02 - 0.05<br>
where Y, W, M, n and Q are as defined above.<br>
The boron-containing CHA molecular sieves, as-synthesized, have a crystalline structure whose X-ray powder diffraction ("XRD") pattern shows the following characteristic lines:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
scintillation counter spectrometer with a strip-chart pen recorder was used. The peak heights I and the positions, as a function of 2 Theta where Theta is the Bragg angle, were read from the spectrometer chart. From these measured values, the relative intensities, 100 x l/lo, where lo is the intensity of the strongest line or peak, and d, the interplanar spacing in Angstroms corresponding to the recorded lines, can be calculated.<br>
Variations in the diffraction pattern can result from variations in the mole ratio of oxides from sample to sample. The molecular sieve produced by exchanging the metal or other cations present in the molecular sieve with various other cations yields a similar diffraction pattern, although there can be shifts in interplanar spacing as well as variations in relative intensity. Calcination can also cause shifts in the X-ray diffraction pattern. Also, the symmetry can change based on the relative amounts of boron and aluminum in the crystal structure. Notwithstanding these perturbations, the basic crystal lattice structure remains unchanged.<br>
Boron-containing CHA molecular sieves are useful in adsorption, in catalysts useful in converting methanol to olefins, synthesis of amines (such as dimethylamine), in the reduction of oxides of nitrogen in gasses (such as automobile exhaust), and in gas separation.<br>
The present invention comprises a process for catalytic conversion of a feedstock comprising one or more oxygenates comprising alcohols and ethers to a hydrocarbon product containing light olefins, i.e., C2, C3 and/or C4 olefins. The feedstock is contacted with the molecular sieve of the present invention at effective process conditions to produce light olefins.<br>
The term "oxygenate" as used herein designates compounds such as alcohols, ethers and mixtures thereof. Examples of oxygenates include, but are not limited to, methanol and dimethyl ether.<br>
The process of the present invention may be conducted in the presence of one or more diluents which may be present in the oxygenate feed in an amount between about 1 and about 99 molar percent, based on the total number of moles of all feed and diluent components. Diluents include, but are not limited to, helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, hydrocarbons (such as methane and the<br><br>
like), aromatic compounds, or mixtures thereof. U. S. Patents No. 4,861,938 and 4,677,242, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, emphasize the use of a diluent to maintain catalyst selectivity toward the production of light olefins, particularly ethylene.<br>
The oxygenate conversion is preferably conducted in the vapor phase such that the oxygenate feedstock is contacted in a vapor phase in a reaction zone with the molecular sieve of this invention at effective process conditions to produce hydrocarbons, i.e., an effective temperature, pressure, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) and, optionally, an effective amount of diluent. The process is conducted for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired light olefins. In general, the residence time employed to produce the desired product can vary from seconds to a number of hours. It will be readily appreciated that the residence time will be determined to a significant extent by the reaction temperature , the molecular sieve catalyst, the WHSV, the phase (liquid or vapor) and process design characteristics. The oxygenate feedstock flow rate affects olefin production. Increasing the feedstock flow rate increases WHSV and enhances the formation of olefin production relative to paraffin production. However, the enhanced olefin production relative to paraffin production is offset by a diminished conversion of oxygenate to hydrocarbons.<br>
The oxygenate conversion process is effectively carried out over a wide range of pressures, including autogenous pressures. At pressures between about 0.01 atmospheres (0.1 kPa) and about 1000 atmospheres (101.3 kPa), the formation of light olefins will be affected although the optimum amount of product will not necessarily be formed at all pressures. The preferred pressure is between about 0.01 atmospheres (0.1 kPa) and about 100 atmospheres (10.13 kPa). More preferably, the pressure will range from about 1 to about 10 atmospheres (101.3 kPa to 1.013 Mpa). The pressures referred to herein are exclusive of the diluent, if any, that is present and refer to the partial pressure of the feedstock as it relates to oxygenate compounds.<br>
The temperature which may be employed in the oxygenate conversion process may vary over a wide range depending, at least in part, on the<br><br>
. molecular sieve catalyst. In general, the process can be conducted at an effective temperature between about 200°C and about 700°C. At the lower end of the temperature range, and thus generally at a lower rate of reaction, the formation of the desired light olefins may become low. At the upper end of the range , the process may not form an optimum amount of light olefins and catalyst deactivation may be rapid.<br>
The molecular sieve catalyst preferably is incorporated into solid particles in which the catalyst is present in an amount effective to promote the desired conversion of oxygenates to light olefins. In one aspect, the solid particles comprise a catalytically effective amount of the catalyst and at least one matrix material selected from the group consisting of binder materials, filler materials and mixtures thereof to provide a desired property or ■ properties, e.g., desired catalyst dilution, mechanical strength and the like to the solid particles. Such matrix materials are often, to some extent, porous in nature and may or may not be effective to promote the desired reaction. Filler and binder materials include, for example, synthetic and naturally occurring substances such as metal oxides, clays, silicas, aluminas, silica-aluminas, silica-magnesias, silica-zirconias, silica-thorias and the like. If matrix materials are included in the catalyst composition, the molecular sieve preferably comprises about 1 to 99%, more preferably about 5 to 90%, and still more preferably about 10 to 80% by weight of the total composition.<br>
The molecular sieve of the present invention can be used in a catalyst to prepare methylamine or dimethylamine. Dimethylamine is generally prepared in industrial quantities by continuous reaction of methanol (and/or dimethylether) and ammonia in the presence of a silica-alumina catalyst. The reactants are typically combined in the vapor phase, at temperatures in the range of 300°C to 500°C, and at elevated pressures. Such a process is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,737,592, issued April 12,1988 to Abrams et al., which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The catalyst is used in its acid form. Acid forms of molecular sieves can be prepared by a variety of techniques. Preferably, the molecular sieve used to prepare dimethylamine will be in the hydrogen form, or have an alkali or alkaline earth metal, such as Na, K, Rb, or Cs, ion-exchanged into it.<br><br>
The process of the present invention involves reacting methanol, dimethylether or a mixture thereof and ammonia in amounts sufficient to provide a carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio from about 0.2 to about 1.5, preferably about 0.5 to about 1.2. The reaction is conducted at a temperature from about 250°C to about 450°C, preferably about 300°C to about 400°C. Reaction pressures can vary from about 7-7000 kPa (1-1000 psi), preferably about 70-3000 kPa (10-500 psi). A methanol and/or dimethylether space time of about 0.01-80 hours, preferably 0.10-1.5 hours, is typically used. This space time is calculated as the mass of catalyst divided by the mass flow rate of methanol/dimethylether introduced into the reactor.<br>
Boron-containing CHA molecular sieves may be used for the catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen in a gas stream. Typically, the gas stream also contains oxygen, often a stoichiometric excess thereof. Also, the molecular sieve may contain a metal or metal ions within or on it which are capable of catalyzing the reduction of the nitrogen oxides. Examples of such metals or metal ions include cobalt, copper, platinum, iron, chromium, manganese, nickel, zinc, lanthanum, palladium, rhodium and mixtures thereof.<br>
One example of such a process for the catalytic reduction of oxides of nitrogen in the presence of a zeolite is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,297,328, issued October 27,1981 to Ritscher et al., which is incorporated by reference herein. There, the catalytic process is the combustion of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and the catalytic reduction of the oxides of nitrogen contained in a gas stream, such as the exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine. The zeolite used is metal ion-exchanged, doped or loaded sufficiently so as to provide an effective amount of catalytic copper metal or copper ions within or on the zeolite. In addition, the process is conducted in an excess of oxidant, e.g., oxygen.<br>
The molecular sieve of the present invention can be used to separate gasses. For example, it can be used to separate carbon dioxide from natural gas. Typically, the molecular sieve is used as a component in a membrane that is used to separate the gasses. Examples of such membranes are<br><br>
. disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 6,508,860, issued January 21, 2003 to Kuikarni et al., which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for treating engine exhaust using a boron-containing molecular sieve having the CHA crystal structure and comprising (1) silicon oxide, and (2) boron oxide or a combination of boron oxide and aluminum oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, gallium oxide and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, oxide (2) is more than 50% boron oxide on a molar basis.<br>
As stated this invention generally relates to a process for treating an engine exhaust stream and in particular to a process for minimizing emissions during the cold start operation of an engine. The engine consists of any internal or external combustion engine which generates an exhaust gas stream containing noxious components or pollutants including unburned or thermally degraded hydrocarbons or similar organics. Other noxious components usually present in the exhaust gas include nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. The engine may be fueled by a hydrocarbonaceous fuel. As used in this specification and in the appended claims, the term "hydrocarbonaceous fuel" includes hydrocarbons, alcohols and mixtures thereof. Examples of hydrocarbons which can be used to fuel the engine are the mixtures of hydrocarbons which make up gasoline or diesel fuel. The alcohols which may be used to fuel engines include ethanol and methanol. Mixtures of alcohols and mixtures of alcohols and hydrocarbons can also be used. The engine may be a jet engine, gas turbine, internal combustion engine, such as an automobile, truck or bus engine, a diesel engine or the like. The process of this invention is particularly suited for hydrocarbon, alcohol, or hydrocarbon-alcohol mixture, internal combustion engine mounted in an automobile. For convenience the description will use hydrocarbon as the fuel to exemplify the invention. The use of hydrocarbon in the subsequent description is not to be construed as limiting the invention to hydrocarbon fueled engines.<br>
When the engine is started up, it produces a relatively high concentration of hydrocarbons in the engine exhaust gas stream as well as other pollutants. Pollutants will be used herein to collectively refer to any<br><br>
, unburned fuel components and combustion byproducts found in the exhaust stream. For example, when the fuel is a hydrocarbon fuel, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and other combustion byproducts will be found in the engine exhaust gas stream. The temperature of this engine exhaust stream is relatively cool, generally below 500° C. and typically in the range of 200° to 400° C. This engine exhaust stream has the above characteristics during the initial period of engine operation, typically for the first 30 to 120 seconds after startup of a cold engine. The engine exhaust stream will typically contain, by volume, about 500 to 1000 ppm hydrocarbons.<br>
The engine exhaust gas stream which is to be treated is flowed over a molecular sieve bed comprising the molecular sieve of this invention to produce a first exhaust stream. The molecular sieve is described below. The first exhaust stream which is discharged from the molecular sieve bed is now flowed over a catalyst to convert the pollutants contained in the first exhaust stream to innocuous components and provide a treated exhaust stream which is discharged into the atmosphere. It is understood that prior to discharge into the atmosphere, the treated exhaust stream may be flowed through a muffler or other sound reduction apparatus well known in the art.<br>
The catalyst which is used to convert the pollutants to innocuous components is usually referred to in the art as a three-component control catalyst because it can simultaneously oxidize any residual hydrocarbons present in the first exhaust stream to carbon dioxide and water, oxidize any residual carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and reduce any residual nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen. In some cases the catalyst may not be required to convert nitric oxide to nitrogen and oxygen, e.g., when an alcohol is used as the fuel. In this case the catalyst is called an oxidation catalyst. Because of the relatively low temperature of the engine exhaust stream and the first exhaust stream, this catalyst does not function at a very high efficiency, thereby necessitating the molecular sieve bed.<br>
When the molecular sieve bed reaches a sufficient temperature, typically about 150-200° C, the pollutants which are adsorbed in the bed begin to desorb and are carried by the first exhaust stream over the catalyst.<br><br>
, At this point the catalyst has reached its operating temperature and is therefore capable of fully converting the pollutants to innocuous components.<br>
The adsorbent bed used in the instant invention can be conveniently employed in particulate form or the adsorbent can be deposited onto a solid monolithic carrier. When particulate form is desired, the adsorbent can be formed into shapes such as pills, pellets, granules, rings, spheres, etc. In the employment of a monolithic form, it is usually most convenient to employ the adsorbent as a thin film or coating deposited on an inert carrier material which provides the structural support for the adsorbent. The inert carrier material can be any refractory material such as ceramic or metallic materials. It is desirable that the carrier material be unreactive with the adsorbent and not be degraded by the gas to which it is exposed. Examples of suitable ceramic materials include sillimanite, petalite, cordierite, mullite, zircon, zircon mullite, spondumene, alumina-titanate, etc. Additionally, metallic materials which are within the scope of this invention include metals and alloys as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,920,583 which are oxidation resistant and are otherwise capable of withstanding high temperatures.<br>
The carrier material can best be utilized in any rigid unitary configuration which provides a plurality of pores or channels extending in the direction of gas flow. It is preferred that the configuration be a honeycomb configuration. The honeycomb structure can be used advantageously in either unitary form, or as an arrangement of multiple modules. The honeycomb structure is usually oriented such that gas flow is generally in the same direction as the cells or channels of the honeycomb structure. For a more detailed discussion of monolithic structures, refer to U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,785,998 and 3,767,453.<br>
The molecular sieve is deposited onto the carrier by any convenient way well known in the art. A preferred method involves preparing a slurry using the molecular sieve and coating the monolithic honeycomb carrier with the slurry. The slurry can be prepared by means known in the art such as combining the appropriate amount of the molecular sieve and a binder with water. This mixture is then blended by using means such as sonification, milling, etc. This slurry is used to coat a monolithic honeycomb by dipping the<br><br>
, honeycomb into the slurry, removing the excess slurry by draining or blowing out the channels, and heating to about 100° C. If the desired loading of molecular sieve is not achieved, the above process may be repeated as many times as required to achieve the desired loading.<br>
Instead of depositing the molecular sieve onto a monolithic honeycomb structure, one can take the molecular sieve and form it into a monolithic honeycomb structure by means known in the art.<br>
The adsorbent may optionally contain one or more catalytic metals dispersed thereon. The metals which can be dispersed on the adsorbent are the noble metals which consist of platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, and mixtures thereof. The desired noble metal may be deposited onto the adsorbent, which acts as a support, in any suitable manner well known in the art. One example of a method of dispersing the noble metal onto the adsorbent support involves impregnating the adsorbent support with an aqueous solution of a decomposable compound of the desired noble metal or metals, drying the adsorbent which has the noble metal compound dispersed on it and then calcining in air at a temperature of about 400° to about 500° C. for a time of about 1 to about 4 hours. By decomposable compound is meant a compound which upon heating in air gives the metal or metal oxide.<br>
Examples of the decomposable compounds which can be used are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,091 which is incorporated by reference. Preferred decomposable compounds are chloroplatinic acid, rhodium trichloride, chloropalladic acid, hexachloroiridate (IV) acid and hexachlororuthenate. It is preferable that the noble metal be present in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 4 weight percent of the adsorbent support. Specifically, in the case of platinum and palladium the range is 0.1 to 4 weight percent, while in the case of rhodium and ruthenium the range is from about 0.01 to 2 weight percent.<br>
These catalytic metals are capable of oxidizing the hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide and reducing the nitric oxide components to innocuous products. Accordingly, the adsorbent bed can act both as an adsorbent and as a catalyst.<br><br>
The catalyst which is used in this invention is selected from any three component control or oxidation catalyst well known in the art. Examples of catalysts are those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,528,279; 4,791,091; 4,760,044; 4,868,148; and 4,868,149, which are all incorporated by reference. Preferred catalysts well known in the art are those that contain platinum and rhodium and optionally palladium, while oxidation catalysts usually do not contain rhodium. Oxidation catalysts usually contain platinum and/or palladium metal. These catalysts may also contain promoters and stabilizers such as barium, cerium, lanthanum, nickel, and iron. The noble metals promoters and stabilizers are usually deposited on a support such as alumina, silica, titania, zirconia, aluminosilicates, and mixtures thereof with alumina being preferred. The catalyst can be conveniently employed in particulate form or the catalytic composite can be deposited on a solid monolithic carrier with a monolithic carrier being preferred. The particulate form and monolithic form of the catalyst are prepared as described for the adsorbent above.<br>
