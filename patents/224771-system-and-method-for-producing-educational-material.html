				<td>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING EDUCATIONAL MATERIAL<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[OOO1] The present invention relates to a system and a method for producing<br>
educational materials, and more particularly, relates to a system and a method for<br>
producing educational materials, which are customized upon respective abilities<br>
and respective environments of respective users (i.e. a student, a teacher, parents)<br>
using database.<br>
Related Art Statements<br>
[0002] A conventional educational material is a typically standardized school<br>
textbook provided by major publisher. For instance, in a school textbook for<br>
first grade in Japan, it is often the case that a visual scene of walking around a<br>
schoolyard lined with cherry trees in full bloom in April (which is a season of an<br>
entrance ceremony in Tokyo in Japan) is illustrated for expressing pleasure of<br>
students in an entrance ceremony. Although cherry trees open out in April in<br>
Tokyo city, they come out in February in Okinawa and they open out in May in<br>
Hokkaidou. Therefore, the cherry blossom does not properly express pleasure<br>
of students in an entrance ceremony. In such a way, conventional textbooks of<br>
Japan are generally standardized in a view of Tokyo city-and they are published<br>
on the basis of a regional environment of Tokyo-centrism. For example, even if<br>
students in Okinawa watch a cherry blossom picture in a textbook, which opens<br>
out in April in Tokyo and which is scheduled in April curriculum, since cherry<br>
blossom dose not open out in April in Okinawa, the student in Okinawa cannot<br>
smell and feel real cherry blossom in that time. Accordingly the students don't<br>
greatly impressed by the flower shown in the textbook.<br>
[0003] As described above, the conventional educational materials are<br>
published with disregard to regional characteristics of respective students. That<br>
is, various scenes with disregard to regionally are illustrated in drawings of<br>
textbooks. Such standardized textbooks could not heighten sensitivity of<br>
students.<br>
Additionally, in a conventional educational environment, teacher<br>
ability is not considered.<br>
Smmary of the Invention<br>
[0004] It is an object of the present invention to provide a system and a<br>
method for producing an educational material in consideration of ability or<br>
personality of respective students, leaning progress, an educational environment,<br>
an educational policy of a school, and ability or personality of respective teachers.<br>
The present system and the method according the present invention<br>
provide three types of educational materials. Although first type of educational<br>
material (i.e. normal type) is similar to ordinary textbook at the first face, the first<br>
type of educational material is produced based upon characteristics of respective<br>
students and opinions of parents/students. Second type of educational material<br>
is produced upon self-initiative of the students, and provides blanks to let the<br>
student to write anything, in which a student is interested, to develop student's<br>
independence and a positive attitude. That is, the second type is a portfolio type<br>
of educational material such as a worksheet or a workbook.<br>
[0005] The present system and method provide the third type educational<br>
material which is a mixture of the first (normal) type and the second (portfolio)<br>
type based upon respective student abilities. Mixture ratio of the hybrid type<br>
educational material is determined by ability and/or leaning level of respective<br>
students. It is noted that educational materials provided by this system may be<br>
utilized in various training ground, such as a school, a school in the<br>
"miscellaneous" category, or a culture center, etc, and the term "student" includes<br>
a person who is taught such as a pupil, a preschooler, or a school student. That<br>
is the present invention is not only for students but also for various persons such<br>
as employees of a company.<br>
[0006] In order to attain the above mentioned object, a system for producing<br>
an educational material according the invention comprises:<br>
storing means for storing raw educational materials into a database;<br>
input means for inputting both student-related data and educational<br>
environment-related data; and<br>
educational material producing means for selecting at least one raw<br>
educational materials from said database based on predetermined selecting<br>
criteria and said inputted both student-related data and educational environment-<br>
related data to arrange said selected at least one raw educational material based<br>
upon a predetermined edution pattern to produce an educational material from<br>
said selected at least one raw educational material.<br>
[0007] According to the present invention, it is possible to easily and<br>
properly provide the educational material which is customized to each student by<br>
inputting student-related data (eg., subject, academic year, age, leaning ability,<br>
leaning history, or autonomy of a student, etc.) and educational-environment data<br>
(e.g., personality, faculty to teach, yeas of experience, achievement of a teacher,<br>
or environment of a school or home, etc.) and selecting any raw educational<br>
material based upon the student-related data, educational-environment data and<br>
predetermined selecting criteria.<br>
[0008] For instance, it is assumed mat a target student is in 3rd grade and he<br>
resides in x-area. To produce textbook about natural science for him, the<br>
present system prompts a user (e.g., a teacher, a student or a parent) to input<br>
following student-related data and educational environment data: "natural<br>
science" as subject, 3rd grade as school year, and x-area as locality. The present<br>
system automatically produces an educational material, which is customized to<br>
this student upon the inputted data and the predetermined selecting criteria. For<br>
producing educational materials for elementary school to high school students, it<br>
is preferable mat the "predetermined selecting criteria" is arranged by reference<br>
to "official guide to teaching" and "time allocation" by Education Ministry.<br>
The official guide to teaching has an influence on content of the educational<br>
materials. The time allocation has an impact on a volume i.e. page count,<br>
In addition the selecting criteria can be discretionary and freely defined by<br>
teachers or parents.<br>
[0009] For example, "official guide to teaching" by Education Ministry in<br>
Japan for natural science to 3rd grade defines three chapter "Animate Beings and<br>
its environment", " Substance and Energy", and "Earth and Outer space". When<br>
the selecting criteria is made from said official guide, the present system will<br>
produce an educational material including the three chapters described above for<br>
the 3rd grade student.<br>
Additionally, in this case the "Animate Beings and its environment"<br>
of the official guide defines to observe about several accessible plants by<br>
cultivating to comprehend the growth of plants, thus the educational material will<br>
include this content. When the student resides in x-rcgion and this locality is<br>
inputted as educational environment-related data, the present system may<br>
produce the educational material including any plants or insects peculiar to x-<br>
area as a content.<br>
A student, a parent or a teacher can modify the educational material<br>
produced by the present system. It is preferable that a teacher rearranges a<br>
format of the educational material to adapt it to respective students.<br>
[0010] A teacher inputs some pieces of data related to both a student and<br>
leaning environment, and the system then produces an educational material.<br>
A teacher, a student, or parents check whether or not the educational material is<br>
well adapted a target student. After the educational material is utilized by the<br>
student and the teacher, the educational material, its raw educational materials<br>
and evaluation of the educational material are stored into a database for leaning<br>
management. These data can be utilized for generating next educational<br>
material for the target student or any student.<br>
An educational environment of area in which students reside (e.g.,<br>
culture, history, and geographical position, etc.) is important and the educational<br>
environment is inputted as educational environment data to utilize this data. For<br>
example, when the present system determines that the target student resides near<br>
the sea based on the inputted educational environment data, the system produces<br>
an educational material, which includes marine products industry or marine<br>
wildlife as content. Accordingly, since the target student has a tendency to feel<br>
immensely attracted to marine wildlife, the educational material including a<br>
content of marine wildlife can more effectively attract the target student and can<br>
improve motivation for leaning of the target student.<br>
[0011] In a preferable embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said educational material and/or said<br>
raw educational materials comprise an element of a text, a still image, a motion<br>
picture, an illustration, a photograph, a figure, a graph or a sound.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, it makes it<br>
possible to provide an educational material, which utilizes various elements such<br>
as a text or motion picture. Since visualized educational material is produced,<br>
the student can more effectively and easily learn using the educational material.<br>
[0012] In another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said educational material is a normal<br>
type to which teachers instruct with reference, a portfolio type which is<br>
recordable by a student and i.e. which is voluntary filled any data along with a<br>
course object by the student, or a hybrid type which is a mixture of the normal<br>
type and portfolio type based upon respective student abilities.<br>
According to this embodiment of the present invention, the present<br>
system can provide various types of educational materials in response to any<br>
purposes. The present system can provide a portfolio type as well as an<br>
ordinary type of educational material. The portfolio type of educational<br>
material is better suited for so-called "Project-based Leaning" or "Active<br>
Leaning". In the case of the portfolio type of educational material, it may<br>
include any hints such as several keywords and URLs for serving as a useful<br>
reference. Of course such hints can be automatically selected in accordance<br>
with the independence of the student and degree of ability of the teacher (i.e.,<br>
student-related data or educational environment-related data) and the selected<br>
hints can be included in the educational material.<br>
[0013] In still another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said educational material producing<br>
means comprises means for generating a guide to teaching and/or an evaluation<br>
sheet based upon the inputted student-related data, educational environment-<br>
related data, the selected raw materials, or the produced educational material.<br>
According to mis embodiment of the present invention, the guide to<br>
teaching and the evaluation sheet, which are adapted to respective educational<br>
material customized for respective students, can easily and automatically are<br>
generated.<br>
[0014] In still another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, the system further comprises<br>
evaluating means for evaluating earnestness or leaning outcome of the respective<br>
students by capturing images of the student using a CCD camera while the<br>
student takes a lecture using the produced educational material and means for<br>
transmitting the evaluated results to a parent-client PC.<br>
[0015] In still another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said database can be one or more<br>
database which is managed by any administrator. The present system further<br>
comprises database for leaning management, which is managed by school-related<br>
persons or a third party entrusted by school. The educational material provided<br>
this system can be utilized by a student, a teacher or a third party and can be<br>
presented on a screen of a PC, or may be printed on paper.<br>
[0016] In still another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said database can be a normal<br>
database or a dedicated database for education. The present system can search<br>
for desired information using a search engine from said database. Files stored<br>
in said database can be managed and sorted by both file-types and file-attributes<br>
(such as hidden file attribute). The present system further comprises means for<br>
gathering the information such as file information (types, attributes, and updating<br>
date, etc.) the evaluation results and any comments from client PC (a student, a<br>
teacher or a parent) in real time or batch process.<br>
[0017] In still another embodiment of the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said database and present system can<br>
be accessible from anywhere in the world via network using PC, web-TV, or STB.<br>
[0018] By way of easily explanation the aspect of the present invention has<br>
been mainly described as systems i.e. devices, however it is understood that the<br>
present invention may be realized as methods corresponding to the systems,<br>
programs embodying the methods as well as a storage media storing the programs.<br>
For example, according to another aspect of the present invention, a<br>
method for producing an educational material comprises the steps of:<br>
storing raw educational materials into a database;<br>
inputting both student-related data and educational environment-related<br>
data; and<br>
selecting at least one raw educational material from said database based<br>
upon predetermined selecting criteria and said inputted both student-related data<br>
and educational environment-related data to produce an educational material<br>
from said selected at least one raw educational material.<br>
[0019] In an embodiment of the method for producing an educational<br>
material according to the present invention, said educational material and/or said<br>
raw educational materials comprise an dement of a text, a still image, a motion<br>
picture, an illustration, a photograph, a figure, a graph or a sound. <br>
[0020] In another embodiment of the method for producing an educational<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0024] Several preferred embodiment of the systems for producing an<br>
educational material according to the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a basic configuration of the system<br>
for producing an educational material according to the invention. As shown in<br>
Fig. 1, the present system 10 for producing an educational material comprises a<br>
database 12, input means 14, and means 16 for producing an educational material.<br>
The database 12 has been loaded with various raw educational materials, which<br>
will be selected and incorporated into an educational material, such as text and<br>
image data. The input means 14 prompts teacher client PC 18, which is<br>
connected to the network interface of the present system via a network such as<br>
Internet, to input student-related data and educational environment-related data.<br>
The means 16 for producing an educational material selects at least one raw<br>
educational material from said database 12 in accordance with the inputted<br>
student-related data and educational environment-related data to generate an<br>
educational material, which is customized for a target student, from the selected<br>
raw educational material. The present system 10 distributes the generated<br>
educational material to respective client PC, which is a local or remote terminal,<br>
via a network. Although the generated educational material can be utilized just<br>
as it is, it can be modified by a teacher or a parent to fit more closely the target '<br>
student.<br>
[0025] Fig. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the basic arrangement of a<br>
computer system which allows to operate the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the invention. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a computer system<br>
20 comprises a processor 21, a RAM 22, a ROM 23, a network interface 24, an<br>
auxiliary storage controller 25 and a system bus 26. The each of elements such<br>
as RAM 22 in the computer system 20 is connected via system bus 26 to each<br>
other. The computer system 20 is connected via the auxiliary storage controller<br>
25 to an auxiliary storage 27. The auxiliary storage 27 or the ROM 23 has stored<br>
program embodying the method of the present invention, a large number of raw<br>
educational materials, and predetermined selecting criteria. Before to operate,<br>
the program is loaded into the RAM 22, then the program are executed in the<br>
processor 21. The computer 20 is connected via the network interface 24 to<br>
network 28 such as Internet and likewise is connected to a remote terminal 19<br>
connected with the network 18. The computer 20 is connected via the network<br>
interface 24 to a client PC (or terminal) 29 or to a remote terminal 30<br>
The client PC 29 or the remote terminal 30 is used for presenting any information<br>
provided by the educational material.<br>
[0026] Fig. 3 is a block diagram schematically depicting a concept of the<br>
learning environment realized by the system for producing an educational<br>
material according to the invention. As depicted in Fig. 3, the database with a<br>
search engine comprises one or more databases which are connected via a<br>
network. The database stores various raw educational materials, selection<br>
criteria, and the generated educational materials with both evaluation sheets and<br>
teaching guides. The said database can be a general database, a database<br>
dedicated for education, or a pay or free database. The database dedicated for<br>
education may have filtering function to filtering harmful contents.<br>
The database dedicated for learning management shown in Fig. 3 can be<br>
accessible by authorized person such as a teacher in charge and can block<br>
unauthorized access using a firewall. The database dedicated for learning<br>
management can store student-related information and educational environment-<br>
related information such as personal information about respective students or<br>
teachers, learning outcomes about students, teaching skills about teachers, lesson<br>
histories of every student, and educational environment of schools. The said<br>
database dedicated for education may be incorporated into the main database.<br>
Information stored in these databases is classified into several classes by<br>
accessibility. For instance, some of the classes are restricted to rewrite by only<br>
authorized person. When files (i.e. information) in the databases are updated,<br>
the present system may gather static information for evaluation such as updaters,<br>
timestamps, changes and used tune to record them as hidden files. Such static<br>
information may be added to the file which is updated. Alternatively, Such<br>
static information may be embedded into the file which is updated using known<br>
watermarking techniques.<br>
[0027] Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing an exemplary method of producing an<br>
educational material according to the invention. As shown in Fig. 4, at a step<br>
S1, the present system prompts a teacher (or a student, or parents) to input both<br>
student-related data, which is related to a targeted student for providing an<br>
educational material, and educational environment-related data. The present<br>
system may provide menu-oriented user interface to prompt users to select any<br>
options such as ages or subject names.<br>
[0028] At a step S2, the present system selects at least one raw educational<br>
material from the database in accordance with the inputted student-related data,<br>
educational environment-related data, and selection criteria for selecting raw<br>
educational materials. The present system then generates an educational<br>
material, which is customized for the target student or class, from the selected<br>
raw educational materials. The present system further automatically generates<br>
an evaluation sheet, a teaching guide sheet and "a school-to-home communica-<br>
tion sheet", which are used by teachers or parents, in accordance with the inputted<br>
data, the generated educational material, and predetermined criteria for making<br>
the sheet. At this moment the generated educational material is a prototype and<br>
thus it can be modified by a student, a teacher or a parent. The educational<br>
material can be a "soft copy" image on some form of electronic display, a<br>
printout, or any other appropriate medium. The each of elements consisting of<br>
the educational material (i.e. raw educational material) can be a text, a still image,<br>
a motion picture, an illustration, a photograph, a figure, a graph or a sound.<br>
[0029] At a step S3, the generated educational material is presented to a<br>
teacher. If necessary the teacher modifies the educational material. For<br>
instance, the teacher checks a plot, a context, a layout, a design, a fitness to the<br>
targeted student with respect to the educational material to modify any parts of<br>
the educational material or replace any parts of it with manually selected raw<br>
educational data.<br>
[0030] At a step S4, the teacher discusses the modified educational material<br>
with both the student and the parents to modify it till the student fully satisfied<br>
with it. The teacher further may change contents or construction of the<br>
educational material in consideration of respective students.<br>
The present system generates a teaching guide sheet including aim of<br>
lesson and an evaluation sheet as well as the educational material.<br>
[0031] The present system collects the evaluation data from the student client<br>
PC to record them into both the evaluation sheet and teaching guide sheet with<br>
respect to each chapter or unit. The teacher gives a lecture using the<br>
educational material in view of the evaluation information in the evaluation sheet<br>
or teaching guide sheet.<br>
The present system further may give an examination to students to<br>
evaluate learning outcomes about the lessons provided by the educational<br>
material. The present system may send a file for examination with a start signal<br>
to the client PC. On receiving the start signal, the student can open the file to<br>
fill out answers to questions. After the lapse of a predetermined period, the file<br>
is automatically closed to record the answers on a hidden file. Afterwards the<br>
hidden file which stores the answers is transmitted to the present system. In this<br>
way, the system can give the test to evaluate for the student who study using the<br>
educational material.<br>
The present system may provide various examinations such as an<br>
essay examination, a true-fake test, or a multiple-choice test. The present<br>
system utilizesan automated marking system to lighten teacher's burden.<br>
[0032] After the student has learned the educational material, the teacher<br>
would confirm achievements based upon the evaluation sheet and the student and<br>
parents would respond to satisfaction surveys about the educational material and<br>
teaching skill of the teacher. Such information will be recorded in the database<br>
dedicated for education.<br>
[0033] Fig. 5 is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method for producing a<br>
self-supported educational material according to the invention;<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, at a step S11, the present system prompts a<br>
teacher (or a student or parents) to input both student-related data, which is<br>
related to a targeted student for providing an educational material, and<br>
educational environment-related data. At a step S12, the present system selects<br>
at least one raw educational material from the database in accordance with the<br>
inputted student-related data, educational environment-related data, and selection<br>
criteria for selecting raw educational materials. The present system then<br>
automatically generates a portfolio type of educational material, which is<br>
customized for the target student or class, from the selected raw educational<br>
materials. The computerized portfolio type of educational material is<br>
recordable by a student, a teacher or parents. In other words, the computerized<br>
portfolio type textbook has many blank spaces. Thus the textbook is voluntary<br>
filled any useful data along with a course object by the student. Educational<br>
level of the textbook is determined based upon both respective abilities and<br>
motivation for learning of students. For the targeted student who has high<br>
learning ability, a positive attitude, and high motivation for learning, the portfolio<br>
type textbook will have many blank spaces. The portfolio type textbook has a<br>
list of recommended books and URLs. The student uses the URLs to do "active<br>
learning" to fill out the blank spaces in the portfolio textbook. The present<br>
system collects the recorded data, which is filled out by the student, from the<br>
portfolio textbook to evaluate it. The teacher then gives advice and appreciation<br>
to the student based upon the evaluation.<br>
[0034] Fig. 6 is a screen interface for displaying the content of the educational<br>
material produced by the present system. The present system automatically<br>
selects adequate raw educational materials form the database in accordance with<br>
both the inputted student-related data and educational environment-related data<br>
to lay out them on a screen interface. As shown in Fig. 6, the screen interface<br>
has a title section, an abstract section, a detailed description section, a visual<br>
section, a related matters section, and a check sheet section. The layout can be<br>
determined based upon a predetermined edit pattern. Additionally, the layout<br>
shown in fig.6 is based upon a standard edit pattern for education. For history <br>
textbook, contents, for example, will be a historic event, its location, detailed<br>
description, figures explaining the event, and related URLs. Volume (i.e.<br>
number of pages) of the textbook can be determined in accordance with the<br>
material selection criteria, which includes allocated time for respective subjects.<br>
The check sheet section can be used to write some data such as impression,<br>
findings or the like. Additionally, the section also is used to develop both<br>
positive attitude and by finding problems to solve them.<br>
[0035] After the educational material is utilized by the student and the<br>
teacher, evaluation examination is performed to evaluate learning outcomes of<br>
the student. When the educational material is a normal type, the test is typically<br>
performed in such way that the present system provides a screen interface for<br>
displaying some questions to client PC of the student to prompt the student to<br>
answer the questions. When the educational material is a portfolio type, the test<br>
is typically performed in such way that the student makes a presentation based on<br>
his portfolio textbook which has been recorded his original useful information<br>
such as his findings about the subject.<br>
[0036] Fig. 7 is a table showing configuration of the teaching guide sheet<br>
generated by the present system and Fig. 8 is a table showing configuration of the<br>
evaluation sheet generated by the present system.<br>
This evaluation sheet and teaching guide sheet are generally provided<br>
to the teacher's client PC to store therein. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the sheets<br>
include student-related and educational environment-related data such as name,<br>
age of the student by each subject or each credit hour. The teaching guide sheet<br>
has a teaching guide section, which includes a learning plan or a learning<br>
coverage. The evaluation sheet has an evaluation description section, which<br>
includes evaluations by a teacher, a student and parents.<br>
