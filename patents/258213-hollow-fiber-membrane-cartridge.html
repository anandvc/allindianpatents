DESCRIPTION<br>
HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANE CARTRIDGE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an immersion<br>
type membrane cartridge using a hollow fiber membrane<br>
set to a suction type tank filter device or an<br>
immersion type filter device. More minutely, the<br>
present invention relates to a hollow fiber membrane<br>
cartridge used for a filter device that removes<br>
turbidity and bacteria from raw water such as river<br>
water, lake water, underground water, seawater,<br>
domestic liquid waste, industrial liquid waste, or<br>
sewage secondary treated water, membrane separation<br>
activated sludge device for carrying out solid-liquid<br>
separation of activated sludge by a membrane, or<br>
separation of valuable objects and non-valuable<br>
objects.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As a waste water treatment method, there is a<br>
membrane separation activated sludge method comprising<br>
immersing a membrane cartridge in an activated sludge<br>
tank and carrying out solid-liquid separation of the<br>
activated sludge and the treated water after the<br>
treatment. This method allows the concentration of the<br>
activated sludge (MLSS: Mixed Liquor Suspended Solid)<br><br>
to be set at a very large value from 5,000 to 20,000<br>
mg/1 for a filtering process. This advantageously<br>
allows the capacity of the activated sludge vessel to<br>
be reduced or enables a reaction time in the activated<br>
sludge vessel to be shortened. Further, the filtration<br>
with the membrane prevents suspended solids (SS) from<br>
being mixed into treated water, thus eliminating the<br>
need for a final sedimentation tank. This makes it<br>
possible to reduce the construction area of the<br>
treatment facility and to achieve filtration regardless<br>
of whether or not activated sludge is appropriately<br>
sedimented. This method thus has advantages such as a<br>
reduction in the load of activated sludge managing<br>
operation. Therefore, in recent years, the membrane<br>
separation activated sludge method has prevailed<br>
rapidly.<br>
If hollow fiber membranes are used for the<br>
membrane cartridge, the high strength of the membrane<br>
itself hinders the surface of the membrane from being<br>
damaged as a result of contact with contaminants<br>
contained in the raw water. The membrane cartridge can<br>
thus be used for a long period. Moreover, this<br>
structure has the advantage of being capable of back<br>
wash reverse filtration, that is, injecting a medium<br>
such as treated water in a direction opposite to that<br>
of filtration to remove fouling to the membrane<br>
surface. In this case, however, effective membrane<br>
area may decrease unless filtration is carried out<br><br>
while excluding aggregates of activated sludge as well<br>
as contaminants from the raw water accumulating in the<br>
gap between the hollow fiber membranes. As a result,<br>
filtration efficiency lowers, thus stable filtration is<br>
prevented from being maintained over a long period.<br>
Conventionally, the following method is used<br>
to avoid accumulating sludge or the like on the<br>
surfaces of hollow fiber membranes or between the<br>
hollow fiber membranes. That is, aeration by air or<br>
the like is performed from the lower portion of a<br>
membrane cartridge, and activated sludge aggregate and<br>
contaminants brought from raw water on the surface of a<br>
hollow fiber membrane or between hollow fiber membranes<br>
are removed in accordance with the oscillation effect<br>
of a membrane and agitation effect by movement of<br>
bubblers upward and thereby, accumulation of them is<br>
prevented. For example, a lower ring (or also referred<br>
to as skirt) is set to the lower portion of a hollow<br>
fiber membrane cartridge and a plurality of through-<br>
holes are formed on a lower-ring-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer to form an air pool in the end of the lower ring<br>
protruded from the lower ring by aeration from the<br>
lower portion of the cartridge. Thus, bubbles are<br>
uniformly generated from the plurality of through-holes<br>
and hollow fiber membranes are oscillated so that a<br>
suspended material deposited on the outer surfaces of<br>
the membranes are easily removed. (For example, refer<br>
to Patent Document 1).<br><br>
According to this method, when filtering<br>
high-concentration MLSS such as the case of the<br>
membrane separation activated sludge method, there is<br>
an effect for removing the sludge between hollow fiber<br>
membrane bundles in accordance with the agitation<br>
effect by aeration and the oscillation effect of a<br>
membrane. However, a force for raising activated<br>
sludge aggregate or contaminants acts due to ascent of<br>
bubbles, and removed sludge moves to a position nearby<br>
the adhesion fixation layer, and they are not easily<br>
removed to the outside of the membrane bundle.<br>
Moreover, the hollow fiber membrane at the portion<br>
nearby the adhesion fixation layer has a small<br>
oscillation amplitude and therefore, it is impossible<br>
to sufficiently remove fouling from the surface of the<br>
membrane, and there is a problem that the surface of a<br>
hollow fiber is clogged because sludge is accumulated<br>
between membranes.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example for illustrating the<br>
structure of a hollow fiber membrane cartridge of the<br>
present invention. The hollow fiber membrane cartridge<br>
has a hollow fiber membrane bundle 1 consisting of<br>
plural hollow fiber membranes and a upper-side adhesion<br>
fixation section 2 and a lower-side adhesion fixation<br>
section 3 at the both ends of the hollow fiber membrane<br>
bundle 1, and the hollow fiber membranes are fixed by<br>
an upper-side adhesion fixation layer 4 and a lower-<br>
side adhesion fixation layer 5. The hollow fiber<br>
membranes open at the end surface 6 of the upper-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer and they may open or may not at<br><br>
the end surface 7 of the lower-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer. More preferable is a structure in which the<br>
hollow fiber membranes open only at the end surface 6<br>
of the upper-side adhesion fixation layer and do not<br>
open at the end surface 7 of the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer, because such a structure enables a<br>
lower-side catchment chamber as well as an auxiliary<br>
facility to be omitted.<br>
A bubble supply port 8 for applying aeration<br>
to hollow fiber membranes may be integrated or may not<br>
with a membrane cartridge. When the membranes are not<br>
integrated with the cartridge, it is preferable to set<br>
the port 8 to a position to which aeration is applied<br>
to a membrane bundle under the membrane cartridge.<br>
Moreover, when the port 8 is integrated with the<br>
cartridge, it is possible to jet vapor from an airtight<br>
pipe or jet vapor from an air pool after supplying the<br>
vapor into a skirt-like space and forming the air pool.<br>
When the port 8 is integrated with the cartridge,<br>
through-holes for bubbles supplied from the lower<br>
portion to escape to the upper portion are formed on<br>
the lower-side adhesion fixation layer 5.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an example in which the end<br>
surfaces of an adhesion fixation layer open at both the<br>
upper side and the lower side of hollow fiber membranes<br>
and a bubble supply port for carrying out aeration is<br>
not integrated with a membrane cartridge. A catchment<br>
chambers 9 and 11 and catchment pipes 10 and 12 are<br><br>
connected to the upper and lower adhesion fixation<br>
portions.<br>
The upper and lower adhesion fixation layers<br>
are connected by a side stem 13. In hollow fiber<br>
membranes, a portion not included in adhesion fixation<br>
layers at the both ends is defined as a filtration<br>
section 14, a portion facing the filtration section-<br>
side in the upper-side adhesion fixation layer 4 is<br>
defined as a filtration section-side interface 15 of<br>
the upper-side adhesion fixation layer, and a portion<br>
facing the filtration section in the lower-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer 5 is defined as the filtration<br>
section-side interface 16 of the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer.<br>
The hollow fiber membrane bundle 1 is divided<br>
into plural small bundles 17 on the upper-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer 4.<br>
Bubbles due to aeration from the lower<br>
portion almost vertically rise in a gap between hollow<br>
fiber membranes while applying oscillation to the<br>
hollow fiber membranes. Amplitude of oscillation of<br>
the hollow fiber membranes are small nearby the upper-<br>
side adhesion fixation layer and the gap becomes small,<br>
and bubbles escape to the outside of a membrane<br>
cartridge.<br>
When a filling factor is increased and the<br>
gap between hollow film membranes is small, solid<br>
matter contained in sludge, fiber-like object, and<br><br>
deposit of sludge cannot escape through the gap. As a<br>
result, they remain between hollow fiber membranes to<br>
decrease a filtering area and make filtering difficult.<br>
To easily remove sludge deposit while<br>
increasing the filling factor of hollow fiber<br>
membranes, it is necessary to form a rarefaction<br>
portion in density of hollow fiber membranes nearby an<br>
upper-side adhesion fixation portion and use the<br>
rarefaction portion as a channel through which sludge<br>
deposit escape. That is, a structure is effective in<br>
which a hollow fiber membrane bundle is divided into<br>
plural small bundles to use the gap between hollow<br>
fiber membrane bundles as a channel of aeration bubbles<br>
and sludge deposit.<br>
However, the gap between hollow fiber<br>
membrane bundles nearby an adhesion portion has a small<br>
amplitude of oscillation and sludge is easily deposited<br>
in the gap. Therefore, by forming small bundles, the<br>
distance between hollow fiber membranes in the small<br>
bundles decreases, a space in which sludge is<br>
accumulated is eliminated, and it is possible to<br>
prevent accumulation.<br>
Moreover, dividing a hollow fiber membrane<br>
bundle into plural small bundles in the portion between<br>
the lower-side adhesion fixation layer and the upper-<br>
side adhesion fixation layer is preferable because<br>
aeration from the lower portion oscillates all hollow<br>
fiber membranes thereby enhancing cleaning effect.<br><br>
Particularly, forming plural mutual confoundings<br>
between the lower-side adhesion fixation layer and the<br>
upper-side adhesion fixation layer on hollow fiber<br>
membranes is preferable because the effect of<br>
oscillation by aeration is further increased. Though<br>
the structure of a lower bundle may be a single bundle,<br>
plural small bundle structures may be used. It is<br>
preferable that hollow fiber membranes are divided into<br>
plural small bundles between the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer and the upper-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer and there is confounding between hollow fiber<br>
membranes. Figs. 2(a) to 2(d) show schematic views of<br>
bundle structures. Bundle structures of the present<br>
invention are shown in Fig. 2(a) to 2(c) but Fig. 2(d)<br>
is not included.<br>
As used herein, the fact that there is<br>
confounding represents that the positional relation<br>
between hollow fiber membranes fixed by the lower-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer does not always coincide with<br>
the positional relation between hollow fiber membranes<br>
fixed by the upper-side adhesion fixation layer. Or it<br>
represents a state in which a rod-like object cannot be<br>
moved due to the intersection between the membranes<br>
when inserting the rod-like object between hollow fiber<br>
membranes from the outside of the cartridge on the<br>
filtration section-side interface of the lower-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer and then, moving the rod-like<br>
object to the upper-side adhesion fixation layer.<br><br>
Confounding can be realized by dividing the<br>
either side of a single bundle of hollow fiber<br>
membranes into small bundle structures, keeping the<br>
shapes of the small bundle structures, and bonding the<br>
both ends of the hollow fiber membranes. For example,<br>
it is possible to form a bundle by winding hollow fiber<br>
membranes on two facing sides of a rectangular frame.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b), it is also possible to<br>
form a confounding state by changing the interval<br>
between hollow fiber membranes to be wound on two<br>
sides.<br>
It is preferable that the shape of an<br>
adhesion fixation layer to be adhered and fixed at the<br>
both ends of a hollow fiber membrane (the shape when<br>
viewing a hollow fiber membrane cartridge from the<br>
upper portion or lower portion after setting the<br>
cartridge so as to arrange the hollow fiber membranes<br>
vertically) is any one of triangle, rectangle, and<br>
hexagon because closet packing is realized when setting<br>
plural hollow fiber membrane cartridges to an immersion<br>
bath. Particularly, a rectangle shape is preferable<br>
because a channel for sludge deposit to escape to the<br>
outside of a cartridge becomes short and thereby sludge<br>
deposit is easily discharged with respect to the same<br>
number of hollow fiber membranes being used. Moreover,<br>
also when infilling plural cartridges, it is possible<br>
to independently set or remove any cartridge in the<br>
horizontal direction by arranging the cartridges in<br><br>
parallel and the setting operation is efficiently<br>
carried out.<br>
In the case of small bundles of hollow fiber<br>
membranes at the filtration section-side interface of<br>
the upper-side adhesion fixation layer, it is<br>
preferable that the distance between nearest hollow<br>
fiber membranes in each small bundle is less than 2 mm<br>
and it is more preferable that the distance is less<br>
than 1 mm because it is possible to increase the<br>
effective membrane area of hollow fiber membranes and<br>
improve the filtering water quantity of a membrane<br>
cartridge. As used herein, the distance between hollow<br>
fiber membranes is the distance between outermost<br>
surfaces of the hollow fiber membranes. Moreover, the<br>
number of hollow fiber membranes constituting each<br>
small bundle preferably is 10 or more and 1000 or less<br>
and more preferably 20 or more and 500 or less.<br>
Accumulation of sludge aggregates and contaminants is<br>
small between hollow fiber membranes in these ranges.<br>
The distance between the nearest small bundles is 2 mm<br>
or more and 100 mm or less, more preferably 3 mm or<br>
more and less than 30 mm. In this range, it is<br>
possible to increase the filling factor of a hollow<br>
fiber membrane and filtering water quantity with little<br>
accumulation of sludge aggregates and contaminants. As<br>
used herein, the distance between small bundles<br>
represents the nearest distance among distances between<br>
outermost surfaces of hollow fiber membranes included<br><br>
in each small bundle.<br>
The aggregation state of hollow fiber<br>
membranes in the lower-side adhesion fixation layer may<br>
be a single bundle structure or may be divided into<br>
plural small bundles.<br>
Hereafter, an embodiment of a hollow fiber<br>
membrane cartridge of the present invention is<br>
described by referring to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In Fig. 1, a hollow fiber membrane cartridge<br>
is constituted of a hollow fiber membrane bundle 1 in<br>
which plural hollow fiber membranes are collected,<br>
upper-side adhesion fixation section 2, and lower-side<br>
adhesion fixation section 3. In the both ends of the<br>
bundled hollow fiber membrane bundle 1, hollow fiber<br>
membranes are integrally connected by an adhesive and<br>
integrally connected in the upper-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer 4 and the lower-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer 5, and are opened at the end surface 6 of the<br>
upper-side adhesion fixation layer and at the end<br>
surface 7 of the lower-side adhesion fixation layer.<br>
Catchment chambers 9 and 11 and catchment pipes 10 and<br>
12 are connected to the upper and lower adhesion<br>
fixation sections. The bubble supply section 8 is set<br>
to the lower portion of the membrane cartridge and<br>
bubbles by aeration move upward while oscillating<br>
hollow fiber membranes.<br>
To integrate the bubble supply section 8 with<br>
the membrane cartridge, the bubble supply section 8 is<br><br>
connected to the lower portion of the catchment chamber<br>
11 as shown in Fig. 3(a). Moreover, it is possible to<br>
apply gas to hollow fiber membranes by forming through-<br>
holes 18 continuing from the bubble supply section 8 up<br>
to the filtration section-side interface 16 of the<br>
lower-side adhesion fixation layer by passing through<br>
the lower-side adhesion fixation layer 5. Moreover, it<br>
is possible to form the lower portion of the lower-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer 5 into an opened skirt 19 and<br>
set a gas jetting port 20 without closing the bubble<br>
supply section as shown in Fig. 3(b).<br>
It is preferable that the size of through-<br>
holes ranges from 2 to 30 mm in an equivalent diameter.<br>
The shape of through-hole is optionally selected from a<br>
polygon such as a triangle, quadrangle, or hexagon,<br>
circle, ellipse, sector, C-shape, or star. It is<br>
preferable that the number of through-holes is 2 to 300<br>
though it depends on the cross-sectional area of a<br>
membrane cartridge or the number of fibers. It is<br>
possible to set positions of the through-holes to<br>
optional positions in the lower-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer 5. However, it is preferable to uniformly<br>
disperse the through-holes in order to uniformly<br>
oscillate all hollow fiber membranes.<br>
It is preferable that the skirt 19 is<br>
protruded to a position lower than the catchment<br>
chamber 11 and fixed to the outer periphery of a hollow<br>
fiber membrane bundle. It is preferable that the<br><br>
length protruded from the lower portion of the<br>
catchment chamber ranges from 5 to 300 mm in order to<br>
prevent dissipation of gas from the lower portion<br>
though it depends on the size of the membrane<br>
cartridge, the amount of supplied gas, and the number<br>
and diameter of through-holes. The length of 300 mm or<br>
less is preferable because a wasted space is small over<br>
the entire length of a cartridge. The length of 5 mm<br>
or more is preferable because the gas supplied to the<br>
cartridge is effectively led to the through-holes but<br>
it is not dissipated in the transverse direction.<br>
For uniformly passing the gas spouted from<br>
the gas jetting port 20 through plural through-holes<br>
18, it is necessary that the gas spouted from the gas<br>
jetting port 20 forms a gas pool on the skirt 19 and<br>
gas is supplied from the gas pool to each through-hole.<br>
The thickness of the gas pool is preferably 30 mm or<br>
more, more preferably 50 mm or more. It is preferable<br>
to determine the position of the gas jetting port 20<br>
for aeration by taking into account the thickness of a<br>
gas pool to be formed.<br>
Though the size of a hollow fiber membrane<br>
cartridge adhesion fixation section (the size when<br>
viewing the hollow fiber membrane cartridge from the<br>
upper portion or lower portion after setting the<br>
cartridge so as to arrange the hollow fiber membranes<br>
vertically) is optional, in the case of a rectangle<br>
structure it is preferable that the aspect ratio<br><br>
(length : width) of the rectangle structure is 3:1 or<br>
more and 50:1 or less. When the aspect ratio is<br>
smaller than 3:1, a channel when sludge passes between<br>
small bundles relatively becomes long but when the<br>
aspect ratio is larger than 50:1, a percentage for<br>
bubbles to dissipate to the outside of a cartridge<br>
increases before the bubbles passing between membrane<br>
bundles reach the upper adhesion fixation layer.<br>
It is preferable that the vertical length of<br>
a hollow fiber membrane cartridge ranges from 300 to<br>
3000 mm.<br>
In the present invention, to prevent the rise<br>
or twist of the lower-side adhesion fixation layer 3 at<br>
the time of aeration, the upper-side adhesion fixation<br>
layer 4 and lower-side adhesion fixation layer 5 are<br>
connected and fixed by any one of a rod, pipe, plate,<br>
chain, cord, and net. The rod or pipe is particularly<br>
preferable. It is preferable to use metal or resin as<br>
the material to be used. Though the shape of the rod<br>
or pipe is optional, it is preferable that the rod or<br>
pipe is cylindrical. A shape having an acute-angle<br>
corner is not very suitable because it causes a damage<br>
when a hollow fiber membrane repeatedly contacts. It<br>
is preferable to determine the thickness of the rod or<br>
pipe by taking into account the strength against<br>
deformation of the material used. Using a pipe or rod<br>
having a high hardness for connection is preferable<br>
because it is possible to prevent a damage when a<br><br>
hollow fiber membrane repeatedly contacts with the pipe<br>
or rod by coating the surface with resin of low<br>
hardness.<br>
For a hole diameter of a hollow fiber<br>
membrane used for the present invention, it is possible<br>
to use a reverse osmosis membrane, ultrafilter or a<br>
precise filter. Moreover, the material of a hollow<br>
fiber membrane is not particularly limited, but the<br>
following are cited: polysulfone, polyether sulfone,<br>
polyacrylonitrile, polyimide, polyether imide,<br>
polyamide, polyether keton, polyether ether keton,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, poly-4-methylpenten,<br>
cellulose, cellulose acetate, polyvinylidene fluoride,<br>
polyethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, and<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene. Moreover, it is possible to<br>
use a compound material thereof. Furthermore, as the<br>
shape of a hollow fiber membrane, a membrane having an<br>
inside diameter ranging from 50 to 3000 jxm and an<br>
inside/outside diameter ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.8<br>
is preferably used.<br>
As an adhesive used for the present<br>
invention, any one of the following polymer materials<br>
is used: epoxy resin, urethane resin, epoxy acrylate<br>
resin, and silicon resin.<br>
It is preferable that the resin hardness of<br>
the filtration section-side interface 15 of the upper-<br>
side adhesion fixation layer and the filtration<br>
section-side interface 16 of the lower-side adhesion<br><br>
fixation layer is 20 A or more and 90 A or less and it<br>
is more preferable that the resin hardness is 20 A or<br>
more and 70 A or less. If the hardness is 20 A or<br>
more, it is possible to keep a shape for a long time.<br>
If the hardness is 90 A or less, it is possible to<br>
sufficiently moderate a strain stress when a hollow<br>
fiber membranes oscillate. It is possible to adjust a<br>
resin hardness of an interface to a preferable range by<br>
using a resin having a low hardness as an adhesive and<br>
moreover bonding such a resin having a low hardness on<br>
a fixed layer adhered to a first stage. . For example,<br>
it is possible to adjust a resin hardness of an<br>
interface by forming an adhesion fixation layer by an<br>
epoxy resin and then bonding a silicon resin on the<br>
epoxy resin or forming an adhesion fixation layer by an<br>
urethane resin and then bonding another urethane resin<br>
having a low hardness on the urethane resin. As<br>
bonding methods, publicly known methods such as<br>
centrifugal bonding method and stationary bonding<br>
method are known. To improve the shrinkage on curing<br>
or strength of an adhesive, it is also allowed to<br>
include a fiber-like object such as glass fiber or<br>
carbon fiber or fine powder such as carbon black,<br>
alumina, or silica in the above adhesive.<br>
Materials of housings of the upper-side<br>
adhesion fixation section 2 and the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation section 3 and the catchment chambers 9 and 11<br>
are not particularly limited and they may be the same<br><br>
or different. However, thermoplastic resin or<br>
stainless steel is preferably used.<br>
In the present invention, as shown in<br>
examples of Figs. 4(a) to 4(c), the arrangement of<br>
small bundles of hollow fiber membranes on the<br>
filtration section-side interface of an upper-side<br>
adhesion fixation layer, irregularity is allowed as<br>
shown in Fig. 4(a) but it is preferable to linearly<br>
arrange the small bundles at equal intervals as shown<br>
in Fig. 4(b). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4(c), the<br>
small bundles may be divided into plural rows. It is<br>
possible that the shape of a small bundle is not<br>
circular or sizes of small bundles are not equal.<br>
[Examples]<br>
Examples of the present invention are<br>
described below. However, the present invention is not<br>
restricted to the examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Two cylindrical pipes 21 having a diameter of<br>
1 cm and a length of 80 cm shown in Fig. 5(a) were<br>
arranged in parallel by keeping a distance of 2 m from<br>
each other to form a winding cassette and wound hollow<br>
fiber membranes 22. The pipes 21 were wound by<br>
rotating them at 1,650 times while adjusting a winding<br>
position so that hollow fiber membranes became small<br>
bundles at the one pipe side and became a single bundle<br>
at the other pipe side. As shown in Fig. 5(b),<br><br>
traverse was conducted when winding the hollow fiber<br>
membrane 22 so that the bundle was divided from the<br>
side which became the lower position of a cartridge<br>
toward the side which became the upper position of the<br>
cartridge and confounding occurs between hollow fiber<br>
membranes.<br>
Each of cylindrical pipes at the both ends on<br>
which hollow fiber membranes were wound was stationary-<br>
bonded in a housing 23 made of ABS resin by using a<br>
urethane resin 24 (made by SANYUREKKUSU Inc. "SA-6330<br>
type"; hardness after curing: 98A) serving as an<br>
adhesion fixation layer in the ABS-resin housing 23.<br>
Thereafter, urethane resin 25 (made by SANYUREKKUSU<br>
Inc., "SA-6330 type"; hardness after curing: 56A) was<br>
fixed on the interface between bonding portion and<br>
nonbonding portion of hollow fiber membranes through<br>
stationary bonding.<br>
A measuring method of resin hardness<br>
conformed to JIS K6253. Along the cutting direction 26<br>
shown in Fig. 5(c), a housing, a urethane resin, and a<br>
cylindrical pipe were cut. The state of one of the cut<br>
cylindrical pipe was the end face shown in Fig. 5(d)<br>
and the other one of the cut cylindrical pipe was the<br>
state shown in Fig. 5(e). A catchment chamber and a<br>
catchment pipe were connected to each of the cut<br>
surfaces while keeping the hollow fiber membranes open.<br>
It is possible to use any connection method as long as<br>
connection is liquid-tightly made.<br><br>
A hollow fiber membrane was a precise<br>
filtering membrane made of polyvinylidene fluoride and<br>
having a small hole diameter of 0.1 µm, outside<br>
diameter of about 1.25 mm, and inside diameter of 0.7<br>
mm and the membrane area of the membrane cartridge was<br>
25 m2. A small bundle was formed by 110 hollow fiber<br>
membranes per bundle at the filtration section-side<br>
interface of the upper adhesion fixation layer and 30<br>
small bundles were present. The distance between<br>
nearest small bundles was 5 mm.<br>
In the connection of two pipes of the winding<br>
cassette, an upper-side adhesion fixation section and a<br>
lower-side adhesion fixation section were connected and<br>
fixed by using two pipes each one of which was obtained<br>
by covering a pipe made of SUS304 and having an outside<br>
diameter of 13 mm with a vinylidene chloride film.<br>
An aeration bubble supply section was set to<br>
a position 5 cm lower than the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer.<br>
A hollow fiber membrane cartridge produced<br>
thereby was immersed in an activated sludge tank having<br>
a volume of 8 m3, and the catchment chamber of the upper<br>
adhesion fixation layer and a filtrate pipe were<br>
connected, and fixed to the activated sludge tank.<br>
Suction filtration was conducted using a<br>
suction pump so that a membrane-filtration flow rate is<br>
0.6 m3/membrane area m2/day while aerating air of 10<br>
Nm3/hr from the aeration bubble supply section to the<br><br>
hollow fiber membrane cartridge. The differential<br>
pressure between membranes in this case ranged between<br>
-15 and -20 kPa and was stable for three months. The<br>
concentration MLSS in the activated sludge tank in the<br>
evaluation period was 10000 mg/1 on average and the<br>
average temperature was 25°C. City sewage water having<br>
an average BOD of 150 mg/1 and SS of 160 mg/1 was used<br>
for the raw water of activated sludge.<br>
The weight of the sludge fouling or<br>
contaminants attached to the cartridge after operation<br>
was 0.84 kg and it was found that the attached quantity<br>
was small. Weights of the cartridge before and after<br>
operation were measured for wet hollow fiber membranes<br>
and the weight difference was defined as the weight of<br>
sludge fouling or contaminants.<br>
Example 2<br>
Two cylindrical pipes 21 having a diameter of<br>
1 cm and a length of 80 cm shown in Fig. 5(a) were<br>
arranged in parallel by keeping a distance of 1.4 m<br>
from each other to form a winding cassette and wound<br>
hollow fiber membranes 22. The winding method, the<br>
bonding and fixing method by urethane resin and the<br>
cutting method were conducted in the same manner as in<br>
Example 1.<br>
Open were end surfaces of the hollow fiber<br>
membranes at the side where small bundles of the hollow<br>
fiber membranes were constituted, while close were the<br><br>
oppsite end surfaces of the hollow fiber membranes at<br>
the side where the end surfaces were buried inside the<br>
urethane resin. A catchment chamber and a catchment<br>
pipe were connected only to the end surfaces of the<br>
hollow fiber membranes at the side where small bundles<br>
of the hollow fiber membranes were constituted. The<br>
hollow fiber membranes were the same as those used in<br>
Example 1. The membrane area of the hollow fiber<br>
membrane cartridge was 17.5 m2. A small bundle was<br>
formed by 110 hollow fiber membranes per bundle at a<br>
filtration section-side interface of the upper adhesion<br>
fixation layer and 30 small bundles were present. The<br>
distance between nearest small bundles was 5 mm.<br>
In the connection of two pipes of the winding<br>
cassette, an upper-side adhesion fixation section and a<br>
lower-side adhesion fixation section were connected and<br>
fixed by using two pipes each one of which was covering<br>
a pipe made of SUS304 and having an outside diameter of<br>
13 mm with a vinylidene chloride film.<br>
An aeration bubble supply section was set to<br>
a position 5 cm lower than the lower-side adhesion<br>
fixation layer.<br>
A hollow fiber membrane cartridge produced<br>
thereby was immersed in an activated sludge tank having<br>
a volume of 8 m3, and the catchment chamber of the upper<br>
adhesion fixation layer and a filtrate pipe were<br>
connected, and fixed to the activated sludge tank.<br>
Suction filtration was conducted using a<br><br>
suction pump so that a membrane-filtration flow rate is<br>
0.6 m3/membrane area m2/day while aerating air of 10<br>
Nm3/hr from the aeration bubble supply section to the<br>
hollow fiber membrane cartridge. The differential<br>
pressure between membranes in this case ranged between<br>
-15 and -20 kPa and was stable for three months. The<br>
concentration MLSS in the activated sludge tank in the<br>
evaluation period was 10000 mg/1 on average and the<br>
average temperature was 25°C. City sewage water having<br>
an average BOD of 150 mg/1 and SS of 160 mg/1 was used<br>
for the raw water of activated sludge.<br>
The weight of the sludge fouling or<br>
contaminants attached to the cartridge after operation<br>
was determined in the same manner as in Example 1. As<br>
a result, the weight was 0.65 kg and it was found that<br>
the attached quantity was small.<br>
Example 3<br>
The hollow fiber membranes, the number<br>
thereof and the housing which are the same as those of<br>
Example 1 were used and all hollow fiber membranes were<br>
collected to one bundle and they are entwined to a<br>
state in which there was confounding between hollow<br>
fiber membranes. Thereafter, the hollow fiber<br>
membranes at one end were divided into the bundles<br>
shown in Fig. 4(b) and the other end was divided as<br>
shown in Fig. 4(c). Under this state, stationary<br>
bonding was carried out together with the catchment<br><br>
chamber, the catchment pipe, and the housing using the<br>
same resin as that used in Example 1. The bonding was<br>
conducted while keeping both ends of the hollow fiber<br>
membranes open. The procedure after that was carried<br>
out similarly to Example 1.<br>
As a result of carrying out the same<br>
evaluation as the case of Example 1, the differential<br>
pressure between membranes ranged from -15 and -21 kPa<br>
and it was stable for three months. Moreover, the<br>
sludge fouling or contaminants attached to the<br>
cartridge after operation was 0.78 kg and it was found<br>
that the attached quantity is small.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
Evaluation was made by an activated sludge<br>
tank in the same filtration conditions as the case of<br>
the Example 1 except that the arrangement of hollow<br>
fiber membranes on the filtration section-side<br>
interface of the upper-side adhesion fixation layer was<br>
not divided into small bundles but it was formed into a<br>
single bundle structure.<br>
In this case, the differential pressure<br>
between membranes suddenly rises for 14 days, reached<br>
up to -80 kPa, and pump suction becomes impossible.<br>
Similarly to the case of Example 1, the<br>
concentration MLSS in the activated sludge tank in the<br>
evaluation period was 10000 mg/1 on average and the<br>
average temperature was 25°C. City sewage water having<br><br>
average BOD of 150 mg/1 and SS of 160 mg/1 was used for<br>
the raw water of activated sludge.<br>
The weight of sludge fouling or contaminants<br>
attached to the cartridge after operation was 6.4 kg<br>
and it was found that the fouling weight was extremely<br>
large.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
Evaluation was made by an activated sludge<br>
tank in the same filtration conditions as the case of<br>
the Example 2 except that the arrangement of hollow<br>
fiber membranes on the filtration section-side<br>
interface of the upper-side adhesion fixation layer was<br>
not divided into small bundles but it was formed into a<br>
single bundle structure.<br>
In this case, the differential pressure<br>
between membranes suddenly rises for 12 days, reached<br>
up to -80 kPa, and pump suction becomes impossible.<br>
Similarly to the case of Example 2, the<br>
concentration MLSS in the activated sludge tank in the<br>
evaluation period was 10000 mg/1 on average and the<br>
average temperature was 25°C. City sewage water having<br>
average BOD of 150 mg/1 and SS of 160 mg/1 was used for<br>
the raw water of activated sludge.<br>
The weight of sludge fouling or contaminants<br>
attached to the cartridge after operation was 5.7 kg<br>
and it was found that the fouling weight was extremely<br>
large.<br><br>
