				<td>Field of Invention<br>
Present invention relates to a rotary electric motor of armature type with electric brush device, particularly to a rotary electric motor suitable for electromotive turning means.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 is shown a rotary electric motor for electromotive turning means of prior art. Fig. 7 is a longitudinal sectional view of above-mentioned electric motor, and Fig. 8 is a plane view of electric brush and bearing support for accommodating said brush of above-mentioned electric motor. In Fig. 7 &amp; 8, 10 denotes electric motor, 11 denotes armature, 12 denotes commentator, 13 denotes yoke,  14 denotes magnet, 15 denotes ball bearing, 16 denotes rotary shaft, 17 denotes lead wire, 18 denotes washer, 19 denotes bearing, 20 denotes bearing support, and 21 denotes electric brush device. Electric brush device 21 includes base 211 and four brush accommodating boxes 212 fixed on base 211. Rotary shaft 16 is supported by bearings 15 and 19.<br>
In the electric motor with above-said construction, bearings support 20 is composed of cylindrical part 201 and end plate 202 provided integrally at end of said cylindrical part 201. Cylindrical part 201 is joined to left end of yoke 13 and fixed on yoke 13. In addition, at inner side of end plate 202, i.e. the side with commentator 12, bearing support 20 is disposed with brush accommodating means 203, in which electric brush device is secured to inner side of end plate 202 with attachment screws 213. Bearing support bore 104 is provided at center part of end plate 202, and bearing 19 is inserted into bearing support bore 104 from outside and abuts against stop ring 204a formed on inner side of bearing support bore 104. Rotary shaft 16 runs through opening 206 ( refer to Fig. 8) of bearing support 206 and supported on bearing 19.<br>
Bearing support 20 is machined from a pressure casting, consisting of cylindrical part 201 and end plate 202, by processing on a lathe to from a brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204. Brush<br><br>
accommodating means 203 is formed at inner side( right side ) of end plate 202 by machining cylindrical part 201 from the right, and on the other hand bearing support bore 204 is formed at the center of end plate 202 by machining the center part of end plate 202 from outer side (left side ). Since bearing support 204 is machined at center part of end plate 202 from outer side, the result is that stop ring 204a for bearing 19 is positioned there side (right side ) of end plate 202. Bearing 19 is inserted from outer side (left side ) into bearing support bore 204 and positioned there by abutting against stop ring 204a.<br>
Thus, brush accommodating means 203 is formed at inner side ( right side ) of end plate 202 by machining cylindrical part 201 from the right, and on the other hand bearing support bore 204 is formed at the center of end plate 202 by machining the center part of end plate 202 from outer side (left side ). It means that brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 are machined from opposite sides respectively. Hence, after the pressure casting for bearing support 20 has been processed on the lathe to from the brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 from one side, said casting has to be removed and clamped again on the lathe to machine the other side. Because of changing of clamping (on the lathe ), centerlines of said brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 are liable to offset with each other. Said offset of these centerlines would make contact of commentator to brush in electric brush device 21 unstable, causing noise in work of electric brush, increase of whirling vibration of rotary shaft and worsening of performance of electric motor.<br>
In view of above-mentioned problems in prior art, present invention aims to provide a rotary electric motor, which is simple in construction, but enhanced in consistency of centerlines of said electric brush device and bearing support bore.<br>

bearing support bore, formed at said end plate. This rotary electric motor is characterized in that, said bearing support bore and said brush accommodating means are formed respectively by machining at same side of said end plate and cylindrical part.<br>
In this rotary electric motor claimed in the present invention bearing support bore and brush accommodating means are formed by machining the same side of end plate and cylindrical part respectively, and consequently their centerlines could be easily and precisely kept in consistency. In addition, noise caused by brush device is lowered, and performance of rotary motor is stabilized.<br>
Also, rotary electric motor claimed in the present invention includes a cylindrical part and bearing support of end plate provided integrally at end of said cylindrical part, as well as electric brush device of brush accommodating means, provided on inner periphery of said cylindrical part.

This rotary electric motor is characterized in that said bearing is inserted from one side of said brush accommodating means into said bearing support bore.<br>
Moreover, in the rotary electric motor claimed in the present invention, since bearing is inserted into bearing support bore from the side of brush accommodating means, bearing support bore and brush accommodating means could be machined from the same side, and consequently their centerlines could be easily and precisely kept in consistency. In addition, noise caused by brush device is lowered, and performance of rotary motor is stabilized.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a rotary electric motor, comprising a bearing support with cylindrical part and end plate disposed integrally at one end of cylindrical part, bearing means inserted into a bearing<br><br>

Concrete Mode of Embodiments<br>
Embodiments of rotary motor of present invention are described in the following text. In the depiction of said embodiments, all part shown and similar in Fig. 7 &amp; 8 are denoted as same numerals with their description omitted.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Embodiment 1 of rotary motor of present invention is shown in Fig. 1 and 2, and said embodiment is used for electromotive turning means. Fig. 1 is a sectional view of electric motor of embodiment 1, particularly about bearing support. Fig. 2 is a right side view of Fig. 1. In Fig. 1 numerals denoting parts 11-16 in Fig. 7 &amp; 8 are omitted, only bearing support 20 and adjacent parts of motor of present invention are shown.<br>
In Fig. 1 &amp; 2, bearing support comprises integrally cyhndrical part<br>
201	and end plate 202. At inner side (right side ) of end plate 202 of said<br>
bearing support 20, i.e. the side disposed with commentator 12( refer to<br>
Fig. 7), is provided electric brush device 21 in brush accommodating<br>
means 203. said brush accommodating means 203 is formed on the inner<br>
surface of cylindrical part 201. In addition, in the center part of end plate<br>
202	is disposed bearing support bore 204 inserted with bearing 19.<br>
For electric brush device 21, on circular base plate 211, with a<br>
Though bore for shaft at center part, are provided construction for fixing 4 brush accommodating brush boxes 212, and base plate 211 is fixed through attachment screws 213 on inner side of end plate 202, i.e. bottom surface of brush accommodating means 203. On the other hand, for bearing support bore 204 at the side of brush accommodating means is provided an opening 204b for insertion of bearing 19, and on its opposite side is provided stop ring 204a to about against bearing 19. Lead wire 17 passes through washer 18, which is elastically snapped into opening 206 of bearing support 20, and is led outside.<br>
In embodiment 1, for bearing support 20 brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 are machined on the lathe from the same side. Concretely speaking, pressure casting, comprising<br><br>
cylindrical apart 201 and end plate202, is processed from inner side (right side ) on lathe to form electric brush accommodating means 203, and on the other hand center part of end plate 202 is machined on lathe from inner side( right side ) also to from bearing support bore 204. The result, that end plate 202 is machined on lathe from inner side to from bearing support bore, is an opening 204b for insertion of bearing 19 formed at inner side of bearing support bore 204. In addition, at outer side of bearing support 204 is formed stop ring 204a for bearing 19. Bearing 19 is inserted from inner side (right side ) though electric brush accommodating means 203 into bearing support bore 204. Bearing 19 is inserted from opening 204b positioned at inner side (right side ) of bearing support bore 204 into bearing support bore 204, and abuts against stop ring 204a, positioned at outer side (left side ) of bearing support 204.<br>
As described above, brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 of bearing support 20 are machined on lathe from the same side. In the concrete, at first electric brush accommodating means 203 is formed by machining cylindrical part 201 on lathe from inner side (right side ), and subsequently bearing support bore 204 is formed by machining end plate 202 on lathe from inner side (right side) also. As a result, in the process of machining brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 on lathe, clamping of work piece (pressure casting) need not be changed. Therefore, each centerline of brush accommodating means 203 and bearing support bore 204 are easy to be highly consistent and coincident, and their depths and diameters could be precisely machined complying with requirement of standards.<br>
Prior to electric brush device 21 is installed in its accommodating means 203; bearing 19 is inserted into bearing support bore 204 by passing through accommodating means 204.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 3 &amp; 4 depict embodiment 2 according to rotary electric motor of present invention, and said embodiment is also used for electromotive turning means. Fig. 3 is a sectional view of bearing support of electric motor of embodiment 2, and Fig. 4 is a right side view. As compared with embodiment 1, a first positioning device is added in said embodiment 2. All parts similar to those in embodiment 1 are denoted by same numerals.<br><br>
In Fig. 3 &amp; 4, element 208 is an example of protrusion in said first positioning device. Said protrusions are disposed at inner peripheral surface of cylindrical part 201 of bearing support 20 as integral parts of 201, and are arranged equidistantly at 4 positions. Comparing said embodiment 2 with above said embodiment 1, the difference between them consists only in arrangement of protrusion 208 and other construction is the same.<br>
As described in embodiment U, electric brush device is secured to bottom side of electric brush accommodating means 203 through base plate 211 by attachment screws 213. Here, dimensions of bolt holes at base plate 211 are usually of free tolerance, and clearance 214 exists between attachment screws and said bolt holes. Therefore, base plate 211 is fixed in electric brush accommodating means 203 only on condition that the clearance in a state of eccentricity. Fixation (of electric brush) in state of eccentricity results in problem of brush noise due to unevenness of contact between electric brush and commentator 12 (refer to Fig. 8).<br>
In embodiment 2, fixation problem in state of eccentricity could be solved trough disposition of protrusion 208. That is, a pitch circle, joining all the tops of 4 protrusions 208, is designed with diameter a little larger than diameter of base plate 211. Thereby, base plate 211 would no longer be controlled by the magnitude of clearance 214 in above said bolt holes, and its radial position is limited by the protrusions 208 and fixed on the bottom surface of brush accommodating means 203 without eccentricity usually.<br>
In addition, in embodiment 2 centerlines of electric brush accommodating means 203 and of bearing support bore 204 could keep precisely consistent with each other as in embodiment 1.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Fig. 5 &amp; 6 depict embodiment 3of rotary electric motor of present invention, and said embodiment 3 is also used for electromotive turning means. Fig. 5 is a sectional view of bearing support of electric motor of embodiment 3, and Fig. 6 is a right side view. Said embodiment 3 is formed on the basis of embodiment 1, added with first poisoning device 215 in its radial direction and second positioning device 216 in its circumferential direction for positioning of electric brush device 21, First<br><br>
positioning device is disposed at the protrusion on outer peripheral surface of base 211, and second positioning devise is an inserting tab between base 211 and end plate 202. In Fig. 5 &amp; 6, parts same as those in embodiment 1 are denoted by same numerals.<br>
Protrusions 215 are arranged on outer peripheral surface of base 211 and disposed equidistantly at 4 locations, being integral with base211. All protrusions 215 are snapped into inner peripheral surface of cylindrical part 201, and its function is same as protrusions in embodiment 2 for radial positioning of electric brush device 21. Concretely speaking, second positioning device 216 is a locating pin, protruding axially from base 211, and said locating pin 216 inserts into hole 209 formed at end plate 202, functioning as circumferential positioning of electric brush device 21.<br>
The circumferential positioning of said electric brush device 21 could prevent displacement of electric brush device, causing increase of brush noise and worsening of performance. At same time, circumferential displacement of electric brush device 21 could lessen the difference in performance, caused by difference in rotating directions of electric motor, and therefore, the motor, used as electromotive turning means, has the effect of lessening the difference of driving performance in left and right turning.<br>
Same as in embodiment 1, in embodiment 3 cisterns of electric brush accommodating means 203 and of bearing support bore 204 could keep precisely consistent with each other.<br>
