				<td>This   invention   relates   to     a   process   for   transferring  granular solids   into   a  pressure   vessel.<br>
Description<br>
This invention relates to a process of introducing granular solids into a pressure vessel under a pressure of at least 2 bar, wherein the solids first of all reach a first container under atmospheric pressure and then a second container of variable pressure, which is disposed thereunder, before they are introduced into the pressure vessel, and wherein the first and the second container each have a lower outlet pas-sage and a movable shutter cooperating with the outlet pas-sage.<br>
Sluice devices of this kind, which employ movable shutters, are known and described for instance in U.S. patent 5,584,970. In these devices, however, small amounts of gas always flow from the pressure vessel to the container under atmospheric pressure and from there into the atmosphere, which in certain cases can be very disadvantageous. It is therefore the object underlying the invention to design the above-mentioned process such that without a remarkable wear of material solids can be introduced into the pressure vessel<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
without gases reaching the atmosphere countercurrently with respect to the solids.<br>
In accordance with the invention this object is solved in that the outlet end of the outlet passage is 20 to 400 mm above the shutter in the closed position, that in the closed position the shutter forms the bottom of a chamber at least partly filled with solids, that the chamber is connected with the outlet passage in a gastight way and there is no gas-tightness between the chamber and the shutter, that in the closed position the shutter carries a solid bed and a verti-cal solid column having a height of at least 1 m is present in the outlet passage and in the container, and that in the closed position seal gas is pressed into the chamber and into the solid column from the outside. This locking process is particularly useful for hot solids, which are introduced into the first container for instance with temperatures in the range from 300 to 1300Â°C.<br>
Expediently, the shutter and at least in part also the cham-ber are disposed in a shutter housing which includes the so-ids inlet for the container disposed thereunder.<br>
It is usually ensured that in the closed position the solid bed in the chamber has a minimum height of 5 mm, so that the area between the edge of the chamber and the shutter becomes largely impermeable to gas.<br>
The pressure in the pressure vessel preferably lies in the range from 3 to 20 bar. The gas in the pressure vessel may be of completely different kinds, it may for instance have a toxic effect or it may consist of hydrogen for at least 50 vol-%, so that it must be prevented from getting in contact with the oxygen of the air.<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
Embodiments of the process will be explained with reference to the accompay in drawing, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1   shows the schematic flow diagram of the process, and<br>
Fig. 2   shows the sealing between two containers with dif-ferent pressure.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, granular free-flowing solids are intro-duced continuously or discontinuously from the top through the inlet 1 into the first container 10, from where they fall into the second container 20 when the shutter 2 is open. When the shutter 3 is open, the solids will first of all fall into a storage bin 30, which has the same excess pressure as a subsequent reactor 40 which is only represented in part. With the bin 30 it is possible that solids discontinuously intro-duced into the bin 30 from the top can continuously be intr-duced into the reactor 40 by means of a conveying screw 31 due to the solids reservoir in the bin 30. The pressure in the bin 30 and in the reactor 40 is at least 2 bar and usu-ally 3 to 20 bar, but it may be even higher.<br>
The second container 20 has a variable pressure, which may be adjusted as required to the atmospheric pressure of the first container 10 or to the pressure in the container 30. The nec-essary sealing between two containers of different pressure is explained with reference to Fig. 2. A horizontally movable shutter 2, the outlet end of an outlet passage 11 belonging to the container 10, a solid bed 14 and a seal gas supplied through line 12 cooperate with each other. In the closed po-sition represented in Fig. 2, the shutter 2 forms the bottom of the downwardly open chamber 13 which is disposed above the same. Between the bottom edge of the chamber 13 and the shut-ter 2 there is a small distance, usually in the range between 0.2 and 2 mm, so that the shutter 2 can be reciprocated with-out touching the chamber 13. The solid bed 14 on the shutter<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
has a minimum height of 5 mm, so that it usually covers the gap between the edge of the chamber and the shutter 2. The vertical distance between the outlet end of the passage 11 and the shutter 2 in the closed position expediently is 20 to 400 mm and preferably at least 40 mm. The lid portion 13a of the chamber 13 is connected with the outlet passage 11 in a gastight way. Line 12 opens in the lid portion, which line is used for supplying seal gas, e.g. nitrogen or C02,   which by means of a compressor 15 (cf. Fig. 1) is pressed from the outside through the open valve 12a into the chamber 13. By means of this seal gas the pressure in the chamber 13 is ad-justed to approximately the pressure as it exists in the con-tainer 20 disposed thereunder.<br>
Since atmospheric pressure exists in the upper portion of the container 10, which is partly filled with solids, seal gas flows from line 12 through the chamber 13 and the solid bed 14 into the solid column disposed in the outlet passage 11 and from there upwards through the solids contained in the container 10 and le aves the container 10 through a vent line 16. To restrict this flow of seal gas, it is important that the height of the solid column in the outlet passage 11 and in the container 10 is at least 1 m and usually at least 2 m. The necessary height of the solid column depends on the pres-sure difference between the chamber 13 and the upper portion of the container 10. During the operation of the sluice de-vice it must be ensured that a certain minimum height of the solid column is maintained. In the individual case, this minimum height will be determined by a test run. It may also be recommendable to always hold the solid column up to the expanding part of the container 10, as is indicated in Fig. 1 by the dotted line 17. By expanding the horizontal cross-section in this area, the flow rate of the seal gas flowing upwards is reduced and a fluidization is thus prevented. This improves the sealing effect of the solid column.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
What has been explained with reference to Fig. 2 concerning the sealing between the first container 10 and the second container 20 disposed thereunder is likewise true for the sealing between the second container 20 and the storage bin 30 with the shutter 3 provided there. Both the shutter 2 and the shutter 3 are disposed in a shutter housing 18, whose lid portion 18a is connected with the chamber 13 in a gastight way, and which has a solids inlet 18b for the container dis-posed thereunder. The respective shutter 2 or 3 can be recip-rocated horizontally by means of a rod 19 which in a sealed manner extends through the housing 18, as is indicated by the double-headed arrow 22. For the sealing between the housing 18 and the rod 19 a stuffing box may for instance be used.<br>
The chamber 13 belonging to the shutter 3 likewise has a seal gas line 12 with associated compressor 15a. Between the bin 30 and the container 20 disposed above the same a pressure compensation line 24 with a valve 25 is provided, and to the line 24 a further pressure compensation line 26 with a valve 29 is attached, which effects the pressure compensation be-tween the containers 10 and 20. The second container 20 is provided with a lockable vent line 27.<br>
Granular solids are transferred from the inlet opening 1 into the bin 30 as follows, and it is assumed that the bin already contains a certain amount of solids, that the shutter 3 is in the closed position (cf. Fig. 1), that in the vicinity of its outlet passage 21 the container 20 contains a solid column having a height of at least 1 m, that seal gas coming from the compressor 15a flows into the chamber 13 through line 12 and flows upwards through the solid column in the passage 21 before it leaves the container 20 through the open line 27. At this moment, the pressure in the container 20 is 1 bar and is equal to the pressure in the container 10, the shutter 2 is open, and solids from the first container 10 flow into the second container 20.<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
When the solid charge in the container 20 has reached the de-sired height, the shutter 2 disposed above the same is closed and the container 10 is largely filled with solids. When the solid column in the passage 11 and in the container 10 has reached the necessary height, seal gas is pressed by the com-pressor 15 through line 12 into the chamber 13 and at the same time also through line 28 and the open valve 28a into the container 20. The valve 27a of the vent line 27 and also the valve 29 of the pressure compensation line 26 are closed. When the pressure in the container 20 has reached the pres-sure in the bin 30, the shutter 3 can be opened, and at the same time the valve 25 is opened in order to effect a pres-sure compensation between the bin 30 and the container 20. When the desired amount of solids has flown into the bin 30, the shutter 3 is closed again and the pressure in the container 20 is again reduced to atmospheric pressure, with the air-relief valve 27a being opened. During this time, seal gas is continuously supplied through the compressor 15a and the line 12 into the chamber 13 and into the solid column of the outlet passage 21. The locking process can now be continued periodically.<br>
Example:<br>
Through the sluice device in accordance with the drawing and the associated description, 200 t/h hot iron ore with a par-ticle-size range between 0 and 2 mm and a temperature of 850Â°C are fed into a reduction reactor 40 in which a pressure of 40 bar exists. The containers 10 and 20 each have a capac-ity of 9 m3, their outlet passages 11 and 21 each have a length of 2 m, and they each have a diameter of 400 mm. In each outlet passage with the associated container 10 or 20 a minimum height of the solid column of 3 m is ensured. The distance between the shutter 2 and the outlet end of the pas-sage 11 is 100 mm, and the minimum height of the solid bed on the shutter 2 is 20 mm; the same is true for the container 20<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
with its outlet passage 21 and the associated shutter 3. Ni-trogen is used as seal gas, which is introduced into the chamber 13 with a pressure of 4.4 bar, when the same should have a sealing effect. The containers 10 and 20 are provided with level indicators known per se. Within 5 minutes, 8 m hot iron ore are passed through the two containers 10 and 20 into the bin 30.<br>
Apart from the ore reservoir, the bin 30 contains a hot gas mixture of 80 vol-% hydrogen, 12 vol-% steam and 8 vol-% ni-trogen, which temporarily also flows into the container 20. Prior to filling the container 20, the same is therefore ren-dered inert by rinsing with nitrogen, the valve 27a being closed and the valve 29 being open.<br><br>
