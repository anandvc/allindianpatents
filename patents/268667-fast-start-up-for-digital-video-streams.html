				<td>FAST START-UP FOR DIGITAL VIDEO STREAMS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention generally relates to a technology for digital video streaming.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
With advent of digital video streaming technology (such as video-on-demand (VOD) systems), users are able to see and hear digital videos, more or less, as the data is being received from a video server.<br>
When video is streamed, the incoming video stream is typically buffered on the user's receiving device (e.g., computer or set-top box) while data is downloaded into it. At some defined point (generally, when the buffer is full), the video contents are presented to the user. As the video content plays, the receiving device empties the data stored in the buffer. However, while the receiving device is playing the stored video, more data is being downloaded to re-fill the buffer. As long as the data can be downloaded at least as fast as it is being played back, the file will play smoothly.<br>
MPEG<br>
The predominant digital video compression and transmission formats are from a family called MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group). It is the name of family of standards used for coding audio-visual information (e.g., movies, video, music, and such) in a digital compressed format.<br>
For the convenience of explanation of video streaming, the MPEG-family video stream is generally discussed and described herein. However, those who are<br>
skilled  in  the  art understand  and  appreciate  that  other  such  digital  video compression and transmission formats exist and may be used.<br>
Of course, there are other digital video compression and transmission formats, such as the H.264 codec. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand how the concepts discussed herein with relationship to MPEG apply to other formats.<br>
GOP and Frames<br>
A MPEG video stream is typically defined by a series of segments called Groups of Pictures (GOP). Typically, a GOP consists of a set of pictures intended to be displayed in sequence over a short duration (e.g., 14 second) when displayed at their intended speed.<br>
A GOP typically includes, three types of frames:<br>
•	an intra frame (I-frame);<br>
•	predictive frames (P-frames); and<br>
•	bi-directionally predictive frames (B-frames).<br>
There is no specific limit to the number of frames which may be in a GOP, nor is there a requirement for an equal number of pictures in all GOPs in a video sequence.<br>
The I-frame is an encoded still image. It is not dependent upon any other frame that the decoder has already received. Each GOP typically has only one I-frame. It is sometimes called a random access point (or "RAP") since it is an entry point for accessing its associated GOP.<br>
From the point of view of a video-stream decoder, the P-frames are predicted from the most recently reconstructed I- or P-frame. A P-frame (such<br>
as frame 120p) requires data from a previously decompressed anchor frames (e.g., I-frames or P-frames) to enable its decompression.<br>
Switching to the point of view of video stream encoder and transmitter, the B-frames are predicted from the closest two I- or P-frames—one frame in the past and one frame in the future. A B-frame (such as frame 132p) requires data from both preceding and succeeding anchor frames (e.g., I-frames or P-frames) to decode its image. It is bi-directionally dependent.<br>
Of course, other digital video compression and transmission formats (such as H.264 codec) may employ other labels, some different types, and different relationships between frames. For example, in H.264, the frame types, frame dependence relationships, and frame ordering are much more decoupled than they are in MPEG. In H.264, the I-frames are independently decodable and are random access points. Also, frames have defined presentation order (like MPEG does). However, the other frames relate differently than do the MPEG P-frames and B-frames.<br>
So, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand how the concepts discussed herein with relationship to MPEG apply to other formats.<br>
Transmission and Presentation Timelines<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates two manifestations of the same MPEG video stream. The first is the transmission timeline 100t and the other is the presentation timeline 100p.<br>
The transmission timeline 100t illustrates a video stream from the perspective  of its  transmission  by  a  video-stream encoder and transmitter.<br>
Alternatively, it may be viewed from the perspective of the receiver of the transmission of the video stream.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the I-frames (e.g., ll0t and 150t) are typically temporally longer than the other frames in the transmission timeline. Since it doesn't utilize data from any other frame, it contains all of the data necessary to produce one complete image for presentation. Consequently, an I-frame includes more data than any of the other frames. Since the I-frame has more data than others, it follows that it typically requires greater time for transmission (and, of course, reception) than the other frame types.<br>
Fig. 1 also shows P-frames (such as 120t) and B-frames (such as 130t and 132t) of the transmission timeline 100t. Relative to the B-frames, the P-frames are temporally longer in the transmission timeline because they typically include more data than the B-frames. However, P-frames are temporally shorter than I-frames because they include less data than I-frames. Since the B-frames rely on data from at least two other frames, they typically do not need as much data of their own to decode their image as do P-frames (which rely on one other frame).<br>
Fig. 1 also illustrates the presentation timeline 100p of the video stream from the perspective of its presentation by the video decoder and presenter. In contrast to their transmission duration, the presentation duration of each frame— regardless of type—is exactly the same. In other words, it displays at a fixed frequency.<br>
The incoming frames of the video stream are decoded, buffered, and then presented at a fixed frequency (e.g., 24 frames per second (fps)) to produce a relatively smooth motion picture presentation to the user. In MPEG 2 used to convey NTSC video, the field rate is fixed, and each MPEG 2 picture may produce<br>
1, 2, or 3 fields. Field pictures are required to produce 1 field, and frame pictures may produce 2 or 3 fields. Thus, the frame picture presentation rate may not be fixed, but it is not dictated by the transmission rate of the frame pictures.<br>
Fig. 1 also illustrates a typical decoded GOP 105 of MPEG in its presentation timeline. This GOP example includes an I-frame ll0p; six P-frames (e.g., 120p); and 14 B-frames (e.g., 130p and 132p). Typically, each GOP includes a series of consecutively presented decoded frames that begin with an I-frame (such as frame 110p).<br>
Order of Transmission and Presentation<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the order in which the frames are presented typically does not directly match the order in which the frames are transmitted. The arrows shown in Fig. 1 between the frames of the transmission timeline 100t and the presentation timeline 100p illustrate a typical way that frames are reordered between reception and presentation. The tail of each arrow has a bullet (i.e., circle) anchor at the end of a transmitted frame. The head of each arrow has an arrowhead pointing to its corresponding presentation frame.<br>
For example, the transmission I-frame 110t corresponds to the presentation I-frame 110p. In reality these are the same frames, but their timeline representations indicate their different manifestations.<br>
Returning to the explanation of this example, the transmission P-frame 120t corresponds to the presentation P-frame 120p. The transmission B-frames 130t and 132t corresponds to the presentation B-frames 130p and 132p. As shown in Fig. 1, these B-frames 130t and 132t are encoded, transmitted, received, and decoded after their P-frame 120t in the transmission timeline 100t, but their<br>
corresponding presentation B-frames 130p and 132p are presented before their P-frame 120p in the presentation timeline 100t. Note that the encoder typically receives the frames in non-compressed form in the same order that the frames are eventually displayed, and the encoder typically performs the.frame re-ordering before compressing the frames.<br>
Furthermore, the next GOP to be transmitted starts with I-frame 150t, but two B-frames 134t and 136t typically come along after this new GOP has begun. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the straggling B-frames 134p and 136p are presented in sequence and before the presentation of the I-frame 150p of the new GOP.<br>
GOP Presentation Delay<br>
Fig. 1 shows that the I-frame ll0t of an example GOP is first received beginning at point T1 in time; however, it is not first presented until point T2. The time gap between the two points is called herein the "GOP presentation delay" and is labeled 170 in Fig. 1. It represents the delay from when the receiver first begins receiving the first frame of a GOP (which is typically the I-frame) until the device first presents the first frame of the GOP.<br>
There are many reasons for this delay. Some are a natural consequence of the video streaming technology and others are imposed into the process to address known technical issues. Some of reasons for the GOP presentation delay include:<br>
•	contrast between the time required to receive a frame transmission and the time required to display a frame;<br>
•	the time required to decode a frame (especially considering inter-frame dependencies for decoding); and<br>
•   built-in delay to facilitate smooth presentation of frames without needed to wait for frame transmission or decoding. The details of these reasons and the knowledge of other reasons are known to those-of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Video-Stream Presentation Start-up Delay<br>
To tune channels in a video-streaming environment (such as digital cable), a receiver receives a video stream and waits for an access point into the stream. A channel change cannot occur until an access point is received. From the perspective of the user, this can lead to lengthy channel change times.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of a video-stream presentation start-up delay at 280. The start-up delay is the effective delay experienced by a user. It includes a delay between when a particular video stream is requested and the actual presentation of the first frame of a GOP from the particular video stream. As shown in Fig. 2, the start-up delay 280 includes the GOP presentation delay 270 (discussed above).<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, this example is explained. A GOP, starting with I-frame 21 Ot, is being transmitted. This is shown in the transmission timeline 200t. The receiver tunes into this video stream at request point R. This selection is illustrated as a user selecting'a video-stream channel using a remote control 260.<br>
Again, this is an example illustration for explanatory purpose. This point R could be at any moment in time after the beginning (i.e., after the beginning of its I-frame 210t)o fa GOP.<br>
The receiver must wait for a random access point (or RAP) in order to access the video stream. In this example, each GOP has one RAP. An I-frame is<br>
an example of a typical RAP. Therefore, each GOP has one I-frame. So, the receiver must wait for the next I-frame (at the beginning of the next GOP) before it can access the video-stream transmission as shown by transmission timeline 200t.<br>
Once the receiver has an I-frame in its buffer, it may refer back to it for dependency decoding of P- and B-frames. Consequently, a conventional system must wait for a RAP before it can start buffering frames (that are useful).<br>
In Fig. 2, the receiver starts buffering the next GOP at point M1 with I-frame 250t. Thus, the first frame that may be eventually presented to the user is I-frame 250t, because it is the first RAP in the stream after the point at which the receiver joined the stream. Because of the GOP presentation delay (discussed above), it actually starts presenting the GOP (with I-frame 250p of presentation timeline 200p) at point M2—which is also the presentation start-up point S of the start-up delay 280.<br>
As demonstrated by the screens 262-266, the start-up delay is the effective delay experienced by a user. The user selects a video-stream channel at request point R (using, for example, a remote 260) and sees a blank screen, as shown by screen 262. Of course, there may be information presented here (such as electronic programming information), but since it is not yet the desired video-stream content it is effectively blank.<br>
Screen 264 shows that screen remains blank even after the next GOP is currently being received. Screen 266 shows that the first image of frame 250p is finally presented to the user.<br>
The average length of this start-up delay is directly proportional to the average GOP length. Some video-stream providers employ relatively long average<br>
GOP lengths. For these instances, this delay is even more acute because the user is waiting longer for the next GOP to come round after she has changed channels.<br>
It short, this start-up delay is very annoying to the typical users and tries their patience.<br>

Described herein is a technology facilitating the presentation of digital video streams. An implementation, described herein, reduces the effective start-up delay in the presentation of the first frames of the video content that occurs when a system tunes into a video stream.<br>

The following description sets forth one or more exemplary implementations of a Fast Start-up for Digital Video Streams that incorporate elements recited in the appended claims. These implementations are described with specificity in order to meet statutory written description, enablement, and best-mode requirements. However, the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent.<br>
The inventors intend these exemplary implementations to be examples. The inventors do not intend these exemplary implementations to limit the scope of the claimed present invention; rather, the inventors have contemplated that the claimed present invention might also be embodied and implemented in other ways, in conjunction with other present or future technologies.<br>
An example of an embodiment of a Fast Start-up for Digital Video Streams may be referred to as an "exemplary fast start-up system."<br>
For the convenience of explanation, digital video streams are discussed and described herein in terms of the MPEG-family standard format. However, those who are skilled in the art understand and appreciate that other such digital video compression and transmission formats exist.<br>
Introduction<br>
The one or more exemplary implementations, described herein, of the present claimed invention may be implemented (in whole or in part) by a<br>
presentation device 708 (of Figs. 7-9) and/or as part of a computing environment like that shown in Fig. 7.<br>
To tune channels in a digital video multicast (e.g., IP multicast) environment, a receiver receives a multicast video data stream and waits for an access point into the stream. This is sometimes called a random access point (RAP). A channel change cannot occur until a RAP is received. Thus may lead to lengthy channel change times.<br>
A multicast environment is an example of one type of environment that employs video streaming. Such an environment may utilize Internet Protocol multicasting (i.e., IP multicasting). Those of ordinary skill in the art are familiar with multicast and its use in a multicast environment.<br>
In many IP multicast scenarios, there is a limited bit-rate available to the client device (i.e., a receiver). The bit-rate used to the client device typically depends on which IP multicasts the client is currently listening to among all available IP multicasts.<br>
Because the total number of ongoing IP multicasts is not limited by the available bit-rate to any particular client, the exemplary fast start-up system is particularly applicable to such a scenario. One may multicast multiple join-in streams (e.g., alternative transmissions 402-207) and a main stream at all times. Furthermore, individual client device may determine for themselves which stream to be listening to at any given point. Also, the bit-rate of the main stream may be as high as the connection to the client device can support—so, a relatively highan apparent steady-state video quality may be achieved.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the exemplary fast start-up system employs a main multicast video stream transmission 300t and one or more alternative multicast<br>
lead-in video stream transmissions (such as transmission 302t) to achieve a faster tuning time. These alternative streams include the same original content as the main stream, but they may have a lower bit-rate than the main stream.<br>
The alternative streams may be low bitrate so that they may be transmitted in less time than is required to transmit the main stream. This is graphically illustrated by alternative video-stream transmission 302t being shorter than the corresponding frames in the main video-stream transmission 300t. Herein, the concept of "low bitrate" is in terms of number of bits per picture (i.e., frame). These may be a normal bitrate in terms of the number of bits per second.<br>
With the exemplary fast start-up system, the video stream content is presented more quickly (than conventional approaches) in response to a tuning command—even if the initial picture is of lesser quality.<br>
While much of the discussion of the exemplary fast start-up system is framed within terms of the MPEG family of digital video compression and transmission formats, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand how the concepts discussed herein with relationship to MPEG apply to other formats, such as H.264.<br>
Exemplary Fast Start-up System with One Alternative Stream<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the exemplary operation of the exemplary fast start-up system with only one alternative video-stream. Fig. 3 shows the main multicast video stream transmission 300t and the alternative multicast lead-in video stream transmission 302t. Although this discussion refers to the use of only one alternative stream, the bulk of the concepts illustrated in this example apply the use of multiple alternative video-streams.<br>
Fig. 3 also illustrates how this operation reduces the apparent video-stream presentation start-up delay—which is the effective delay experienced by the user. This start-up delay is the delay between the time a particular video stream is requested and the actual presentation of the first frame of a GOP.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, this example is explained. A GOP starting with I-frame 310t is transmitted in the main stream 300t. The receiver tunes into this video stream at request point R. This selection is illustrated as a user selecting a video-stream channel using a remote control 360. (However, in a multicast environment this stream 300t is requested, but since the receiver is not yet tuned in, the stream may not actually be transmitted to the receiver until some point after R.)<br>
Again, this is an example illustration for explanatory purpose. This point R could be at any moment in time within a GOP after its beginning (i.e., after the beginning of its I-frame 310t).<br>
The receiver typically waits for a random access point (or RAP) in order to access a video stream. (In this example, each GOP is assumed to have one RAP.) An I-frame is an example of a typical RAP. So, the receiver must wait for the next I-frame (at the beginning of the next GOP transmission) before it can access a video-stream transmission and present the video.<br>
With conventional approaches, the user would start seeing the video presentation (as shown in presentation timeline 300p) upon the presentation of the first I-frame 350p at point M2. Therefore, the conventional presentation start-up delay (D) would be the difference between the request point (R) and point M2. Written as an equation that is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Conventional Presentation Start-up Delay<br>
However, instead of waiting for the next RAP in the main stream transmission 300t, the exemplary fast start-up system tunes into the alternative video-stream transmission 302t. It starts receiving this GOP transmission at point A. The RAP of alternative transmission 302t is I-frame 312t; therefore, it can begin presenting the alternative presentation timeline 302p with presentation I-frame 312p at point S'.<br>
While alternative video-stream is presented (as shown in presentation timeline 302p), the exemplary fast start-up system requests that the multicast router switch the receiver to the main stream multicast transmission 300t at the next RAP (e.g., I-frame 350t) of the main stream.<br>
While alternative video-stream is presented (as shown in presentation timeline 302p), the exemplary fast start-up system starts receiving main video-stream transmission 300t starting with the first frame (e.g., I-frame 350t) of the next GOP of the main stream. In Fig. 3, the first frame (e.g., I-frame 350t) of the next GOP starts at point M1. Point B on the timeline represents the end of the reception of the last frame of the alternative stream transmission 302t.<br>
The switch-over from the alternative stream transmission 302t back to the main stream 300t occurs during or around the gap between points B and M1 in Fig. 3. An exaggerated and visible gap between these points is shown in Fig. 3 to illustrate that there is a clear opportunity for the exemplary fast start-up system to join the main stream.    In reality, points B and M1 may occur very nearly<br>
concurrently and may indeed be concurrent. It is possible in some embodiments to have an small overlap so that point B occurs shortly after point Mj.<br>
At point M2, the exemplary fast start-up system starts presenting main video-stream presentation 300p starting with the first frame (e.g., I-frame 350p) of the next GOP of the main stream. This starts immediately after (or very nearly so) the presentation of the last frame (e.g., frame 322p) of the alternative stream presentation 302p. This presentation switch-over point is designated in Fig. 3 at point M2.<br>
To accomplish switch-over, it may be desirable for the main stream be tagged for splicing. Alternatively, the RAP locations within the main stream may be conveyed to the multicast router via some other mechanism. Furthermore, it may be desirable for the router have an extension to normal IP multicast so that it starts delivering the main stream multicast transmission when the next RAP in the main stream multicast arrives.<br>
Although not necessarily required, it is desirable for the presentation of the alternative stream 302p to be timed so that the last frame presented (e.g., frame 322p) is presented immediately before the presentation of the first frame (e.g., frame 350p) of the main stream presentation 300p. Doing so enhances the smooth presentation of the video content—in particular, it smoothes the presentation of the switch-over from the alternative to the main stream presentations at point M2.<br>
As demonstrated by the screens 362-366, the start-up delay is the effective delay experienced by a user. The user selects a video-stream channel at request point R (using, for example, a remote 360) and sees a blank screen, as shown by screen 362.     Of course, there may be information presented here (such as<br>
electronic programming information), but since it is not yet the desired video-stream content it is effectively blank.<br>
Screen 364 shows that screen remains blank even as the RAP of the alternative stream 302t is being transmitted and received. However, screen 366 shows that the first image of frame 312p is presented to the user.<br>
With the exemplary fast start-up system (as shown in Fig. 3), the user first experiences the presentation of the video content (as shown in alternative presentation timeline 302p) upon the presentation of the first I-frame 312p at point S'. Therefore, the new presentation start-up delay (D') would be the difference between the request point (R) and presentation of the alternative stream at point S'. Expressed as an equation, that is<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
New Presentation Start-up Delay<br>
The time-savings effected by the exemplary fast start-up system is the difference between the D' and D. Using equations 1 and 2, that time-savings may be expressed as this equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
With the exemplary fast start-up system, the user experience is improved because the new start-up delay (D') is less than the conventional start-up delay (D) (i.e., D' 
by decreasing the effective start-up delay experienced by the user when compared to the delay experienced using conventional approaches.<br>
Exemplary Fast Start-up System with Multiple Alternative Streams<br>
To further minimize the start-up delay, the exemplary fast start-up system may account for the randomness at which a user tunes into a video-stream channel by employing multiple alternative, RAP phase-staggered video-stream transmissions.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the main multicast video stream transmission 400t and phase-staggered multiple alternative lead-in video-stream transmissions 402t-407t. Each alternative transmission may be sent using all of the available band width—thereby minimizing transmission time for each stream. Also, the transmission schedule of the streams are phase-staggered so that the completed reception of each stream's RAP is staggered. Since the RAP of each of the streams illustrated in Fig. 4 is at the beginning of the transmissions, the beginning of each of the transmissions 402t-407t is staggered. This staggered start of the alternative transmissions is illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
Furthermore, the time range of phase-staggering of the alternative streams 402t-407t is between RAPs of the main stream transmission 400t. In Fig. 4, this is illustrated by the phase-staggering between I-frames 410t and 450t.<br>
By sending multiple different streams, tuning time is improved because the receiver may select one of the lead-in streams to play. The one selected will typically be the one which will be ready to be presented the quickest after the time at which the user tunes.<br>
These alternative transmissions need not be sent concurrently to a particular receiver within a multicast environment. Rather, each one is prepared for transmission, but a particular multicast stream is sent to a particular receiver only when requested by that receiver. Fig. 4 shows six alternative request points (R1 through R6) where each one corresponds to a particular alternative video-stream transmission (streams 402t-407t, respectively).<br>
For example, when the exemplary fast start-up system wishes to tune to a channel (examples are indicated by points R1 through R6), it queries the multicast server (such as content server 712 of Fig. 7) in order to determine which lead-in alternative stream is the first lead-in that has not started yet, and the receiver joins that alternative multicast transmission. Then, the exemplary fast start-up system requests that the router switch the receiver back to the main stream multicast transmission 400t just before the next RAP (e.g., frame 450t) of the main stream.<br>
Since the alternative stream transmission(s) serves as a "bridge" until the receiver can start receiving the next RAP of the main stream 400t, all of these alternative streams (402t-408t) are shown in Fig. 4 ending at point B.<br>
In Fig. 4, the first frame (e.g., I-frame 450t) of the next GOP starts at point Ml. Point B on the timeline represents the end of the reception of the last frame of each of the alternative streams (402t-408t)<br>
The switch-over from each of the alternative streams (402t-408t) back to the main stream 400t occurs during or around the gap between points B and M1 in Fig. 4. An exaggerated and visible gap between these points is shown in Fig. 4 to illustrate that there is a clear opportunity for the exemplary fast start-up system to join the main stream.    In reality, points B and M1 may occur very nearly<br>
concurrently and may indeed be concurrent. It is possible in some embodiments to have a small overlap so that point B occurs shortly after point M1.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the alternative video-stream presentations 402p-407p that correspond to the alterative video-stream transmissions 402p-407p, respectively. Although not necessarily required, it is desirable for the alternative video-stream presentations 402p-407p to be timed so that the last frame presented is presented immediately before the presentation of the first frame of the main stream presentation 400p. Doing so enhances the smooth presentation of the video content—in particular, it smoothes the presentation of the switch-over from the alternative to the main stream presentations at point M2.<br>
Operation of Exemplary Fast Start-up System<br>
Fig. 5 shows a methodological implementation of the exemplary fast startup system. This methodological implementation may be performed in software, hardware, or a combination thereof.<br>
At 510 of Fig. 5, the user tunes into a specific main video-stream multicast transmission (e.g., 300t or 400t). This example point is designated at points R in Fig. 3 and R1 through R6 in Fig. 4.<br>
At 512, the exemplary fast start-up system queries a multicast server (such as content server 712 of Fig. 7) in order to determine which of the alternative RAP-phase-staggered lead-in alternative video streams is the first lead-in that has not started yet. Of course, if there is only one alternative transmission, this query may be viewed simply as a request.<br>
At 514, the exemplary fast start-up system joins the alternative multicast transmission identified by the query.    It receives and buffers this alternative<br>
transmission. This occurs, for example, at designated points A in Fig. 3 and A1 through A6 in Fig. 4.<br>
At 516, it presents the video stream of the identified and buffered alternative transmission. This occurs, for example, at designated point.S in Fig. 3.<br>
At 518, the exemplary fast start-up system switches back to receiving and buffering the main stream multicast transmission (e.g., 300t and 400t) exactly at the next RAP (e.g., frame 350t and 450t) of the main stream. It may do this by requesting that the router switch the receiver back to the main stream multicast transmission exactly at the next RAP of the main stream. This occurs, for example, between or around designated points B and M1 in Figs. 3 and 4. This may also be described as occurring "on or about" such designated points.<br>
At 520, it presents the video stream of the main stream multicast. This occurs, for example, at designated point M2 in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
Operation of Exemplary Fast Start-up Multicast System<br>
Fig. 6 shows a methodological implementation of the exemplary fast startup multicast system, which may be embodied by a content provider 702 and/or a content distribution system 706 of Fig. 7). This methodological implementation may be performed in software, hardware, or a combination thereof.<br>
At 610 of Fig. 6, the exemplary fast start-up multicast system concurrently encodes one or more alternative video streams for transmission. The server system encodes each alternative stream so that the RAP of each is phase-staggered relative to the other streams.<br>
Furthermore, each stream is encoded so that each ends at the same point, which is at or near when the next RAP is available in the main video stream. This designated point, for example, is point M1 in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
At 612, the multicast system receives a query to which of the RAP-phase-staggered lead-in alternative video streams is the first lead-in that has not started yet. Of course, if there is only one alternative transmission, this query may be viewed simply as a request.<br>
At 614, it transmits the alternative multicast transmission identified by the query to the receiver that requested it.<br>
At 616, the multicast system receives a request for the router switch the receiver back to the main stream multicast transmission just before the next RAP of the main stream. At 618, it does so in response to such a request. This occurs, for example, between or around designated points B and M1 in Figs. 3 and 4.. This may also be described as occurring "on or about" such designated points.<br>
Exemplary Environment<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates an exemplary environment 700 in which the techniques, systems, and other aspects described herein may be implemented (partially or wholly). Exemplary environment 700 is a television entertainment system that facilitates distribution of multi-media.<br>
