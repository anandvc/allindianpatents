				<td>METHOD OF PREPARING A CONTINUOUS LENGTH OF CURED<br>
IN PLACE LINER, IN PLACE LINER SO PREPARED AND APPARATUS FOR<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to cured in place liners for trenchless rehabilitation of<br>
existing conduits and pipelines, and more particularly to a cured in place liner of a resin<br>
impregnable material with an integral inner impermeable layer continuously<br>
manufactured in desired lengths for trenchless rehabilitation of existing conduits by<br>
pulling in and inflating.<br>
[0002] It is generally well known that existing conduits and pipelines, particularly<br><br>
underground pipes, such as sanitary sewer pipes, storm sewer pipes, water lines and gas<br>
lines that are employed for conducting fluids frequently require repair due to fluid<br>
leakage. The leakage may be inward from the environment into the interior or conducting<br>
portion of the pipelines. Alternatively, the leakage may be outward from the conducting<br>
portion of the pipeline into the surrounding environment. In either case of infiltration or<br>
exfultration, it is desirable to avoid this type of leakage.<br>
[0003] The lcakage in the existing conduit may be due to improper installation of the<br>
original pipeline, or deterioration of the pipe itself due to normal aging, or the effects of<br>
conveying corrosive or abrasive material. Cracks at, or near pipe joints may be due to<br>
environment conditions such as earthquakes, or the movement of large vehicles on the<br>
overhead surface, or similar natural or man-made vibrations, or other such causes.<br>
Regardless of the cause, such leakages are undesirable and may result in waste of the<br>
fluid being conveyed within the pipeline, or result in damage to the surrounding<br>
environment and possible creation of dangerous public health hazards. If the leakage<br>
continues it can lead to structural failure of the existing conduit due to loss of soil and<br>
side support of the conduit.<br>
[0004] Because of ever increasing labor and machinery costs, it is increasingly more<br>
difficult and less economical to repair underground pipes or portions that may be leaking<br>
by digging up the existing pipe and replacing the pipe with a new one. As a result,<br><br><br><br>
various methods have been devised for the in place repair or rehabilitation of existing<br>
pipelines. These new methods avoid the expense and hazards associated with digging up<br>
and replacing the pipe or pipe sections, as well as the significant inconvenience to the<br>
public during construction. One of the most successful pipeline repair or trenchless<br>
rehabilitation processes that is currently in wide use is called the InsituformÂ® Process.<br>
The Insituform Process is described in detail in U.S. Patents No. 4,009,063, No.<br>
4,064,211 and No. 4,135,958, the contents of which are all incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0005] In the standard practice of the Insituform Process an elongated flexible tubular<br>
liner of a felt fabric, foam or similar resin impregnable material with an outer<br>
impermeable coating that has been impregnated with a thermoseting curable resin is<br>
installed within the existing pipeline. In the most widely practiced embodiment of that<br>
process, the liner is installed utilizing an eversion process, as described in the 211 and<br>
'958 Insituform patents. In the eversion process, radial pressure applied to the interior of<br>
an everted liner presses it against and into engagement with the inner surface of the<br>
pipeline as the liner unfolds along the length of the pipeline. The Insituform Process is<br>
also practiced by pulling a resin impregnated liner into the conduit by a rope or cable and<br>
using a separate fluid impermeable inflation bla'ddel? or tube that is everted within the<br>
liner to cause the liner to cure against the inner wall of the existing pipeline. Such resin<br>
impregnated liners are generally referred to as "cured-in-place-pipes" or "CIPP liners"<br>
and the installation is referred to a CIPP installation.<br>
[0006] Conventional cured in place flexible tubular liners for both the eversion and<br>
pull-in-and-inflate CIPP installations have an outer smooth layer of relatively flexible,<br>
substantially impermeable polymer coating in its initial state. The outer coating allows a<br>
resin to be impregnated into the inner layer of resin impregnable material, such as felt<br>
When everted, this impermeable layer ends up on the inside of the liner with the resin<br>
impregnated layer against the wall of the existing pipeline. As the flexible liner is<br>
installed in place within the pipeline, the pipeline is pressurized from within, preferably<br>
utilizing an eversion fluid, such as water or air to force the liner radially outwardly to<br>
engage and conform to the interior surface of the existing pipeline. Cure of the resin is<br><br>
initiated by introduction of hot curing fluid, such as water into the everted liner through a<br>
recirculation hose attached to the end of the everting liner. The resin impregnated into the<br>
impregnable material then cures to form a hard, tight fitting rigid pipe lining within the<br>
existing pipeline. The new liner effectively seals any cracks and repairs any pipe section<br>
or pipe joint deterioration in order to prevent further leakage either into or out of the<br>
existing pipeline. The cured resin also serves to strengthen the existing pipeline wall so<br>
as to provide added structural support for the surrounding environment<br>
[0007] When tubular cured in place liners are installed by the pull-in-and-inflate<br>
method, the liner is impregnated with resin in the same manner as in the eversion process<br>
and pulled into and positioned within the existing pipeline in a collapsed state. In a<br>
typical installation, a downtube, inflation pipe or conduit having an elbow at the lower<br>
end is positioned within an existing manhole or access point and an everting bladder is<br>
passed through the downtube, opened up and cuffed back over the mouth of the<br>
horizontal portion of the elbow and inserted into the collapsed liner. The collapsed liner<br>
within the existing conduit is then positioned over and secured to the cuffed back end of<br>
the inflation bladder. An everting fluid, such as water, is then fed into the downtube and<br>
the water pressure causes the inflation bladder to push out of the horizontal portion of the<br>
elbow and cause the collapsed liner to expand against the interior surface of the existing<br>
conduit. The eversion of the inflation bladder continues until the bladder reaches and<br>
extends into the downstream manhole or second access point At this time the liner<br>
pressed against the interior surface of the existing conduit is allow to cure. Cure is<br>
initiated by introduction of hot curing water introduced into the inflation bladder in much<br>
the same manner as the recirculation line tied to the end of the everting bladder to cause<br>
the resin in the impregnated layer to cure.<br>
[0008] After the resin in the liner cures, the inflation bladder may be removed or left<br>
in place in the cured liner. Both the pull-in and inflate method as well as the eversion<br>
method typically require man-access to restricted manhole space on several occasions<br>
during the process. For example, man-access is required to secure the everting liner or<br>
bladder to the end of the elbow and insert it into the collapsed liner.<br><br>
[0009] Regardless of how the liner is to be installed a curable thermosetting resin is<br>
impregnated into the resin absorbent layers of a liner by a process referred to as "wet out"<br>
The wet-out process generally involves injecting resin into resin absorbent layers through<br>
an end or an opening formed in the outer impermeable film, drawing a vacuum and<br>
passing the impregnated liner through nip rollers as is well known in the lining art A<br>
wide variety of resins may be used, such as polyester, vinyl esters, epoxy resins and the<br>
like, which may be modified as desired. It is preferable to utilize a resin which is<br>
relatively stable at room temperature, but which cures readily when heated with air, steam<br>
or hot water, or subjected to appropriate radiation, such as ultra-violet light<br>
[0010] One such procedure for wetting out a liner by vacuum impregnation is<br>
described in msituform U.S. Patent No. 4,366,012. When the liner has inner and outer<br>
impermeable layers, the tubular liner may be supplied flat and slits formed on opposite<br>
sides of the flattened liner and resin injected and on both sides as described in the '063<br>
Patent Another apparatus for wetting out at the time of installation while drawing a<br>
vacuum at the trailing end of the liner is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,182,262. The<br>
contents of each of these patents are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0011] Recent efforts have been made to modify the pull-in and inflate method to<br>
utilize air to evert a bladder into the pulled-in liner from a proximal access point. When<br>
the everting bladder reaches the distal access point, steam is introduced into the proximal<br>
access point to initiate cure of the resin impregnated into the resin impregnable layer.<br>
This process offers the advantage of faster cure due to the increased energy carried by the<br>
steam as the curing fluid. However, the process still requires eversion of a bladder into<br>
the pulled-in impregnated liner. Efforts to avoid this step of everting the bladder into the<br>
pulled-in liner include performing the eversion step above ground. For example, in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,270,289, the process includes everting a calibration hose into a flat-lying<br>
lining hose above ground prior to pulling the hose assembly into the existing conduit<br>
This process avoids the eversion below grade, but is severely limited into the length of<br>
lining that can be laid out above ground prior to pulling-in.<br>
[0012] A further suggestion to avoid this eversion is to manufacture a liner having an<br>
inner coating and an outer coating so that a curing fluid can be introduced directly into a<br><br>
pulled-in liner. The disadvantages here involves the difficulty faced when trying to<br>
impregnate the resin impregnable material disposed between the inner and outer<br>
impermeable coatings. The outer coating remains essential for handling the impregnated<br>
liner and to allow the liner to be pulled into the existing conduit and the inner coating is<br>
desired to all for curing with the steam.<br>
[0013] Notwithstanding the modifications to both the eversion and pull-in and inflate<br>
trenchless rehabilitation methods, both processes are labor intensive, require an eversion<br>
step and suffer from the increased costs associated with this. Accordingly, it is desirable<br>
to provide a rehabilitation method utilizing pull-in and inflate methodology wherein the<br>
liner is manufactured with an inner and outer coatings and readily impregnated so that it<br>
can be cured by steam as the curing fluid to take advantage of the energy available to<br>
provide an installation method which is faster and more efficient economically than<br>
current rehabilitation methods.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0014] Generally speaking, in accordance with the invention, a resin impregnated<br>
cured in place liner with an integral inner impermeable layer suitable for pull-in and<br>
inflate rehabilitation of existing pipelines is provided; The liner is continuously formed<br>
from a length of resin absorbent material having bonded thereto on one surface an<br>
impermeable layer formed into a tubular shape and sealed into a tube with the<br>
impermeable layer on the inside of the tube. The resin absorbent tube with the inner<br>
impermeable layer may be wrapped with additional layers of resin absorbent material<br>
secured into tubular form. An impermeable film is wrapped about the inner resin<br>
impregnable tube. The resin absorbent material may be impregnated with a thermosetting<br>
resin before or after the outer resin impermeable film is wrapped about the inner tube.<br>
[0015] The inner impermeable layer should be one which is resistant to the high<br>
temperatures of the curing fluid and exposure to fluids intended to be carried with in the<br>
rehabilitated pipe. The outer layer may be simply heat sealed using a thermal bond or<br>
taped. This outer seal merely encapsulates the resin impregnated material but should<br><br>
have sufficient strength to withstand handling and abrasion as the liner is transported and<br>
then pulled into the existing conduit<br>
[0016] The resin absorbent material with the integral impermeable layer on one<br>
surface can be formed into a tube and sealed in a variety of ways. This includes<br>
conventional heat bonding and taping, sewing and taping, or sealing with an extruded<br>
material. The tube is continuously formed with the resin impregnable layer on the inside<br>
about a tubular device in one direction with the impermeable layer on the outside, sealed<br>
in a conventional manner and then everted continuously through the forming device. The<br>
outer layer is now the resin absorbent layer or layers that are impregnated prior to or after<br>
being wrapped with a polymeric coating to contain the resin and allow for storage and<br>
pulling the liner with inner and outer impermeable layers into the existing conduit<br>
[0017] Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide an improved method of<br>
cured-in-place rehabilitation of existing pipelines.<br>
[0018] Another object of the invention is to provide an improved liner for cured in<br>
place rehabilitation of an existing pipeline.<br>
[0019] A further object of the invention is to provide an improved liner having an<br>
integral inner impermeable layer suitable for, trenchless rehabilitation of existing<br>
pipelines.<br>
[0020] Yet another object of the invention is provide an improved method of<br>
continuously manufacturing a resin impregnated cured in place liner having an integral<br>
inner impermeable layer.<br>
[0021] Yet a further object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a<br>
resin impregnated cured in place liner having an integral inner impermeable layers and an<br>
outer impermeable coating for pull-in and inflate trenchless pipeline installation.<br>
[0022] Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will<br>
in part be apparent from the specification.<br>
[0023] The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or<br>
more of such steps with respect to each of the others, the apparatuses embodying features of<br><br>
construction, combinations and arrangement of parts that are adapted to effect such steps,<br>
and the products that possess the characteristics, features, properties, and the relation of<br>
components, which are exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the<br>
invention will be indicated in the claims.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0032] A resin impregnated cured in place liner prepared in accordance with the<br>
invention has an integral internal lining so that it can be installed by the pull-in-and-<br><br>
inflate method and inflated and cured with a heated fluid without the use of an inflation<br>
bladder. The impregnated liner with inner impermeable polymer layer is prepared<br>
continuously in desired lengths. The liner may be impregnated as it is assembled in view<br>
of the increased effort necessary to impregnate a flattened liner having a resin absorbent<br>
material between an inner and an outer coating using convention vacuum impregnation<br>
technology.<br>
[0033] This increased effort necessary is evidenced by the process suggested in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,270,289. Here, above ground a calibration hose is inverted into a flat-lying<br>
impregnated lining hose, or an impregnated lining hose is inverted into a tubular film<br>
using compressed air. In this case, the length of the lining hose approximates the length<br><br>
of the underground conduit to be lined. The inversion of one tube inside the other<br>
requires an unobstructed length equal to the length of the longest layer. If the two layers<br>
had not been previously impregnated, it would be necessary to inject resin between the<br>
layers on both sides of the lay flat tubes in order to provide adequate impregnation. This<br>
is a difficult and inefficient way to impregnate lining tubes. Thus, not only is the length<br>
restricted, but also the impregnation is extremely difficult.<br>
[0034] FIG. 1 illustrates a flexible cured in place liner 11 of the type generally in use<br>
today and well known in the art. Liner 11 is formed from at least one layer of a flexible<br>
resin impregnable material, such as a felt layer 12 having an outer impermeable polymer<br>
film layer 13. Felt layer 12 and outer polymer layer 13 are stitched along a seam line 14<br>
to form a tubular liner. A compatible thermoplastic film in a form of a tape or extruded<br>
material 16 is placed on or extruded over seam line 14 in order to ensure the<br>
impermeability of liner 11. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1 and used throughout<br>
this description, liner 11 includes an inner tube of a second felt layer 17 also stitched<br>
along a seam line 18 positioned at a point in the tube other than the location of seam line<br>
14 in outer felt layer 12. Outer felt layer 12 with polymer layer 13 is then formed around<br>
inner tubular layer 17. After impregnation liner 11 in a continuous length is stored in a<br>
refrigeration unit to suppress premature cure of the resin. Liner 11 is then cut to a desired<br>
length after being pulled into the existing pipeline, or is cut prior to being everted into the<br>
existing pipeline.<br><br>
[0035] Liner 11 of the type illustrated in FIG. 1 is impermeable to water and air. This<br>
will allow use in an air or water eversion as described above. However, in a pull in and<br>
inflate installation in accordance with the invention, the outer coating on the liner need<br>
only be sufficiently impermeable to allow for suitable wet out and retention of resin and<br>
to prevent damage to the liner as it is pulled into the existing pipeline.<br>
[0036] For larger liner diameters, several layers of felt or resin impregnable material<br>
may be used. Felt layers 12 and 17 may be natural or synthetic flexible resin absorbable<br>
material, such as polyester, acrylic polypropylene, or inorganic fibers such as glass and<br>
carbon. Alternatively, the resin absorbent material may be a foam. Impermeable film 13<br>
in outer impermeable layer 12 may be a polyolefin, such as polyethylene or<br>
polypropylene, a vinyl polymer, such as polyvinyl chloride, or a polyurethane as is well<br>
known in the art. Any form of sewing, adhesive-bonding or flame bonding, or any other<br>
convenient means can be used to join the material into tubes. In the initial step in all<br>
trenchless rehabilitation installations, the existing pipeline is prepared by cleaning and<br>
videotaping.<br>
[0037] Referring now to FIG. 2, a cured in place liner 21 prepared in accordance with<br>
the invention is shown in cross-section. Liner 21 is constructed in similar fashion to<br>
convention liner 11, but includes an inner tubular member with an integral inner<br>
impermeable layer 22 that has a thin felt or resin impregnable layer 23 bonded thereto.<br>
Inner felt layer 23 with impermeable layer 22 has been sewn along abutting longitudinal<br>
edges to form a seam line 24 by a row of stitches 26 and sealed with a tape 27 applied<br>
over stitches 26. An outer felt layer 28 is wrapped about inner thin felt layer 23 and<br>
formed into a tube by stitches 29. Finally, an outer layer or wrapping 31 is disposed<br>
about outer felt layer 28.<br>
[0038] By providing a liner having both inner and outer impermeable layers, it is not<br>
necessary to evert the liner during installation or evert an inflation bladder after the liner<br>
has been pulled into the existing conduit Thus, significant saving in labor cost at the<br>
time of installation are available. It also allows for use of a heated curing fluid such as<br>
steam to inflate and cure the resin. In such case all the heated fluids are introduced into<br>
the liner below ground level to provide a safer work environment.<br><br>
[0039] Felt layers 23 and 28 may be impregnated in the usual manner using vacuum.<br>
Alternatively, felt layers 23 and 28 are first impregnated with resin and then an outer<br>
impermeable wrapping 31 is applied. This avoids the difficulty with impregnating a<br>
finished liner having felt layers between an inner and outer impregnable layer. In U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,009,063, Eric Wood proposed injecting resin in the felt layer using needles<br>
inserted into opposite sides of a flattened constructed liner. This operation requires<br>
cutting and patching needle holes in the outer coating. The vacuum impregnation process<br>
taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,366,012 would not be suitable unless the vacuum is drawn on<br>
both sides as the inner coating is a barrier to resin flow in a liner with inner and outer<br>
coating. In order to overcome these impregnation difficulties, liner 21 is manufactured<br>
from endless rolls of flat coated and plain felt and continuously impregnated prior to<br>
application of outer wrapping 31. This is accomplished by the method illustrated in<br>
FIGS. 3 and 5 resulting in a liner 68 as illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
[0040] While felt layers 23 and 28 are formed into tubes by stitching and/or taping,<br>
any of the conventionally known methods for forming felt or other resin impregnable<br>
material into tubes is suitable. For example, tubes can be formed by use of various glues<br>
or adhesives as well as flame bonding. Tape may be applied to inner felt layer 23 and<br>
inner impermeable layer 22 by applying an adhesive strip, extruding a layer of polymeric<br>
material, or heat fusing the tape in order to seal the butted edges of the felt material and<br>
the holes formed during a sewing operation.<br>
[0041] Referring now to FIG. 3, a method for continuously forming a length of a tube<br>
of resin impregnable material with a sealed inner layer of impermeable material is shown.<br>
A roll of coated felt 36 having an endless length of felt 37 with an impermeable layer 38<br>
bonded to one surface is fed over a directional roller 39 in flat form with coated side<br>
facing roller 39 to a tube-forming device 41.<br>
[0042] Tube forming device 41 includes a tubular support frame 42 having a proximal<br>
end 42a and a distal end 42b and a film deformer 40. A seaming device 43 that may be a<br>
sewing and taping machine, gluing machine or flame bonding apparatus is mounted<br>
above support frame 42. Felt 37 with impermeable layer 38 facing roller 39 is fed in the<br>
direction of an arrow A to the proximal end of tube forming device 41 where it is<br><br>
deflected by deflector 40 and wrapped around support frame 42 and seamed into a tube<br>
44 along a seam line 46 with felt 37 on the inside and impermeable layer 38 on the<br>
outside. Tube 44 then passes a taping device 47 where a tape 48 is placed over seam line<br>
46 to form an impermeable coated taped tube member 45.<br>
[0043] Taped tube member 45 then continues to travel along tubular support frame 42<br>
to an inverter ring 49 at the distal end 42b of support frame 42. Taped tube member 45 is<br>
then everted into tubular support frame 42 so that impermeable layer 38 is now on the<br>
inside of tube 45 as it is withdrawn from the proximal end 42a of tubular support frame<br>
42 along a line defined by an arrow B. At this point everted tube 45 has the structure<br>
illustrated in cross-section in FIG. 4 with impermeable layer 38 on the inside of tube 45<br>
and felt layer 37 on the outside. Tube 45 then continues to travel in the direction of arrow<br>
B for the addition of one or more plain felt layers. Tube 45 is then stored for further use,<br>
wrapped with an outer impermeable coating, or may be passed directly to a resin<br>
impregnation step as shown on FIG. 5 prior to final wrapping.<br>
[0044] FIG. 5 illustrates in schematic impregnation of a supply 51 of taped tube 45.<br>
Here, tube 45 is pulled in arrow direction C by or through a pair of rubber covered pulling<br>
rollers 52 into an open top resin tank 53 filled to a predetermined level with a curable<br>
thermoset resin 54 to form an impregnated or wet out tube 55. Tube 45 passes between a<br>
first and second set of compression rollers 56 and 57 and around a first directional roller<br>
58 to turn tube 45 in a horizontal direction and a second directional roller 59 to turn tube<br>
to a vertical direction. A sonic wave generator 61 may be utilized in lieu of or in addition<br>
to second compression rollers 57. Sonic wave generator 61 improves the impregnation of<br>
resin 54 into felt layer 37 of tube 45 as it passes through resin tank 53. After changing<br>
direction about second directional roller 59, impregnated tube 55 passes between a pair of<br>
pneumatic calibration rollers 62. At this time, tube 55 then enters through a film<br>
wrapping and sealing station 63.<br>
[0045] Wrapping and sealing station 63 includes a roll 64 of a resin impermeable film<br>
material 66 that is wrapped about moving impregnated tube 55 as it passes into a film<br>
edge sealer device 67. Resin impregnated tube 55 is now a wrapped tube 68 having an<br>
impermeable outer wrapping 69 with an edge seal 71 as it exits film edge sealer 67 as<br><br>
shown in cross-section in FIG. 7. Wrapped tube 68 is pulled by a pair of final pulling<br>
rollers 72 and fed along an arrow D as shown in FIG. 5 to a refrigerated truck for<br>
shipment to an installation site.<br>
[0046] FIG. 6 is a cross-sectional view of edge sealing device 63 showing film 66<br>
formed into a sealed tube 69 of impermeable film 66 with a sealed edge 71.<br>
[0047] FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the finished wrapped tube 68 with<br>
impregnable layer 37 and integral inner impermeable layer 38 bonded thereto and outer<br>
wrapping 69. As noted in connection with liner 21 in FIG. 2, there may be more than one<br>
layer of resin impregnable, depending on the diameter or engineering requirements of the<br>
installation.<br>
[0048] Once at the installation site, impregnated tube 68 paving inner impermeable<br>
layer 38 and outer impermeable wrapping 69 is ready for installation by the pull-in-and-<br>
inflate method. This method is fully described in U.S. Patent No. 4,009,063, the contents<br>
of which are incorporated herein by reference. In the case of installation by the pull-in-<br>
and-inflate method, a separate eversion bladder is not necessary to inflate the liner due to<br>
the presence of integral inner impermeable layer 38. By proper selection of materials for<br>
integral inner impermeable layer 38, such as polypropylene, inflation and curing can be<br>
done with steam introduced into the liner 68 once in position in the existing conduit.<br>
[0049] The processes and apparatuses described herein provide a convenient means to<br>
prepare a cured in place liner having an inner impermeable layer and an outer<br>
impermeable film. A tube forming and eversion apparatus as illustrated in FIG. 3 readily<br>
provides a method to prepare the inner portion of the finished tube with a sealed<br>
impermeable layer on the inside of the tube and an outer felt or resin impregnable layer.<br>
Additional layers of uncoated felt may be wrapped about the formed inner tube if desired.<br>
[0050] The tube prepared in accordance with the process described in connection with<br>
FIG. 3 is then readily impregnated in an open top resin tank and wrapped with an<br>
impermeable wrapping as described in connection with the apparatus shown in FIG. 5.<br>
Use of an open resin tank and compression rollers avoids the need to impregnate utilizing<br>
high pressure techniques which are cumbersome to use in view of the desire to<br><br>
impregnate in a continuous fashion. Alternatively, if the liner is wrapped prior to resin<br>
impregnation, the liner can be wet out by vacuum in the usual manner as noted above.<br>
[0051] It will thus be seen that the objects set forth above, among those made apparent<br>
from the preceding description, are efficiently attained and, since certain changes may be<br>
made in carrying out the above process, in the described product, and in the constructions)<br>
set forth without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention, it is intended that all<br>
matter contained in the above description and shown in the accompanying drawing(s) shall<br>
be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>
[0052] It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of<br>
