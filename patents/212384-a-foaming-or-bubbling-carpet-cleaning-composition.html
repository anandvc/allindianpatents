CARPET CLEANERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to fabric cleaning compositions of the type adaptable for use in the cleaning of textile fabrics such as carpets, and more particularly to cleaning ■ compositions for carpets that do not require rubbing, scrubbing, or vacuuming,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fabric cleaning formulations have been previously developed and employed in the cleaning of textile fabrics of the type normally found in carpets and rugs. Many of the prior fabric cleaning formulations involve the use of detergent materials in aqueous or solvent mediums, in which dirt and soil are removed by normal detergent action. Others involve formulations which are applied dry or damp to the fabric surface. Soil and dirt particles are, in effect, loosened by mild detergent action. Loosened particles are then adsorbed on particles of filler material and thereafter vacuumed from the fabric.<br>
A disadvantage to many of the previous cleaning formulations is that the cleaned area is wet or damp for a long period of time, making the carpeted area unusable. In addition, some carpet cleaners are of the foam type in which the foam will remain stable for a long period of time, for example 15 to 20 minutes, before it collapses. Thereafter, the carpet is allowed to dry, when dry it can be vacuumed and then used.<br>
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a composition with a quick breaking foam or even a bubbling action that cleans a variety of stains without the need for subsequent vacuuming of the carpet In so doing, the carpeted area that has been cleaned will be useable in a shorter period of time.<br><br>
The present invention is directed to a foaming or bubbling composition for cleaning carpets which comprises a solvent system comprising one or more organic solvents; a surfactant selected from the group consisting of anionic surfactant, non-ionic surfactant, and mixtures thereof; a propellant; and water. The composition may also contain an hydrotrope. The composition optionally contains one or more cationic surfactants, one or more corrosion inhibitors, pH buffering agents, perfumes, perfume carriers, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers, antioxidants, antimicrobials, germicidals, fungicidals, acaricides, allergen neutralizer and preservatives, wherein the foam breaks within ten minutes of application to the carpet.<br>
The organic solvents can be selected from one or more of glycol ethers, m-Pyrol, low molecular weight alcohols, and mixtures thereof. Examples of glycol ethers include ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol phenyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol monopropyl ether, dipropylene glycol monopropyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether and ethylene glycol monohexyl ether. Examples of low molecular weight alcohols include methanol, ethanol, n-propanolf isopropanol, and the like. Preferably, the solvent system is selected from the group consisting of propylene glycol monopropyl ether or a mixture of dipropylene glycpl . methyl ether and dipropylene glycol monobutyl ether.<br>
The non-ionic surfactant is preferably a surfactant having a formula RO(CH2CH20)nH wherein R is a mixture of linear, even carbon-number hydrocarbon chains ranging from C^H25 to C^H33 and n represents the number of repeating units and is a number of from about 1 to about 12. Examples of other non-ionic surfactants include higher aliphatic primary alcohols containing about twelve to about 16 carbon atoms which are condensed with about three to thirteen moles of ethylene oxide.<br>
Other examples of nonionic surfactants include primary alcohol ethoxylates (available under the Neodol tradename from Shell Co,), such as Cni alkanol condensed with 9 moles of ethylene oxide (Neodol 1-9), C12-13 alkanol condensed with 6.5 motes ethylene oxide (Neodol 23-6.5), C12.13 alkanol with 9 moles of ethylene oxide (Neodol 23-9)i C^.i5 alkanol condensed with 7 or 3 moles ethylene oxide (Neodol 25-7 or Neodol<br><br>
25-3), Cu.i5 aikanol condensed .with 13 moles ethylene oxide (Neodoi 45-13), ¾ti linear ethoxyiated alcohol, averaging 2.5 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol (Neodoi 91-2.5), and the like.<br>
Other examples of non-ionic surfactants suitable for use in the present invention include ethylene oxide condensate products of secondary aliphatic alcohols containing -11 to 18 carbon atoms in a straight or branched chain-configuration condensed with 5 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide. Examples of commercially available nonionic detergents of the foregoing type are Cn.15 secondary aikanol condensed with either 9 moles of ethylene oxide (Tergitol 15-S-9) or 12 moles of ethylene oxide (Tergitol 15-S•12j marketed by Union Carbide, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical.<br>
Octyiphenoxy polyethoxyethanol type non-ionic surfactants, for example, Triton X-100, as well as amine oxides can also be used as a non-ionic surfactant in the present invention.<br>
Other examples of linear primary alcohol ethoxyiates are available under the Tomadol tradename such as, for example, Tornado! 1-7, a Ct1 linear primary alcohol ethoxylate with 7 moles EO; Tomadol 25-7, a CirCis linear primary alcohol ethoxylate with 7 moles EO; Tomadol 45~7,a Cl4-C15 linear primary alcohol ethoxylate with 7 moles EO; Bad Tomadol 91-6, a CQ-C^ linear alcohol ethoxylate with 6 moles EO.<br>
Anionic surfactants can also be used in the present invention. Suitable anionic surfactants include, for example, alcohol sulfates (e,g. aikali metal or ammonium salts of alcohol sulfates) and sulfonates, alcohol phosphates and phosphonates, alkyl sultanates, ethoxyiated alkyl sulfonates, alkylaryl sulfonates, G10.ie alkyl benzene sulfonates, CWa alkyl alkoxy carboxylates having 1 to 5 moles of ethylene oxide, and the C10-1B sarcosinates.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also contain propellants such as pressurized gases, including carbon dioxide, air, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, as well as others, for example, propane, butane, pentane, Isobutane, isopentane, mixtures of hydrocarbon gases {such as, for example, A-46 and A-70 available from Phillips Petroleum, CAP 40 and CAP 48 available from Shell, BPAP 40 available from BP<br><br>
Chemicals), dimethyl ether, and mixtures thereof. The amount of propellant used is generally between 2 and 20% w/w of the entire composition. More preferably between 3 and 10% w/w of the entire composition. Typically, 6% w/w propellant is used.<br>
The foam composition of the present invention is designed so that it collapses, or breaks, within a short period of time, preferably less than ten minutes, more preferably less than five minutes, even more preferably less than one minute and most preferably less than thirty seconds. Alternatively the composition can give a bubbling action for a short period of time, preferably less than five minutes, more preferably less than one minute even more preferably less than thirty seconds. The quick breaking of the foam or the bubbling action permits the spot to blotted up quickly, allowing the carpeted surface to be used in a shorter period of time over conventional foam-type carpet cleaners where the time for the foam to collapse is longer, making clean-up time longer.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the removal of stains from carpets which comprises the step of applying an effective amount of the composition of the present invention to a carpet in need of such treatment.<br>

r<br>
Anionic surfactants can also be used in the present invention. Suitable anionic surfactants include,.for example, alcohol sulfates (e.g. alkali metal or ammonium salts of alcohol sulfates) and sulfonates, alcohol phosphates and phosphonates, alky! ' sulfonates, ethoxylated alkyl sulfonates, alkylaryl sulfonates, C10-ie alkyl benzene sulfonates, C10-ia alkyl alkoxy carboxylates having 1 to 5 moles of ethylene oxide, and the C10-18 sarcosinates<br>
Preferably, the,alkyl chain length of a chosen surfactant will range from about nine-eleven carbon atoms to about 16 carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, the preferred non-ionic surfactants are found in the Examples. The amount of non-ionic surfactant present in the compositions ranges from about 0.2 to about 0.5 wt.%, preferably from about 0.2 to about 0.4 wt% of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also contain propellants such as pressurized gases, including carbon dioxide, air, nitrogen, nitrous oxide, as well as others, for example, propane, butane, pentane, isobutane, isopentane, mixtures of hydrocarbon gases (such as, for example, A-46 and A-70 available from Phillips Petroleum, CAP 40 and CAP 48 available from Shell, BPAP 40 available from BP Chemicals), dimethyl ether, and mixtures thereof. The amount of propellant used is generally between 2 and 20% w/w of the entire composition.. More preferably between 3 and 10% w/w of the entire composition. Typically, 6% w/w propellant is used.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the removal of stains from carpets which comprises the step of applying an effective amount of the composition of the present invention to a carpet in need of such treatment<br><br>
The compositions are largely aqueous in nature, and comprise water. Water is added to order to provide to 100% by weight of the compositions of the invention. The water may be tap water, but is preferably distilled and is most preferably deionized water. If the water is tap water, it is preferably substantially free of any undesirable impurities such as organics or inorganics, especially mineral salts which are present in hard water which may thus undesirably interfere with the operation of the constituents present in the aqueous compositions according to the invention.<br>
The composition of the present invention may also contain one or more hydrotropes. Suitable hydrotropes are sodium cumene sulfonate (ELTESOL SC4O available from Albright &amp; Wilson), sodium xylene sulfonate (ELTESOL SX4O available from Albright &amp; Wilson), di-sodium mono- and di-alkyl disulfonate diphenyloxide (DOWFAX 3B2 available from Dow Chemicals), n-octane sodium sulfonate (BIOTERGE PAS 7 S or 8 S available from Stepan),<br>
The compositions of the present invention can optionally contain one or more cationic surfactants, one or more corrosion inhibitors, pH buffering agents, perfumes, perfume carriers, pH adjusting agents, pH buffers, antioxidants, antimicrobials, germicidals, fungicidals, acaricides, allergen neutralizer and preservatives which, when present, should be present in minor amounts, preferably in total comprise less than about 5% by weight (on an active weight basis) of the compositions, and desirably less than about 3%wt. It is known that certain types of fragrances can have an effect on the speed in which the foam breaks, but even with fragrance in the composition, the foam will still break within the range often minutes.<br>
The foam composition of the present invention is designed so that it collapses, or breaks, within a short period of time, preferably less than ten minutes, more preferably less than five minutes, even more preferably less than one minute and most preferably less than thirty seconds. Alternatively the composition can give a bubbling action for a short period of time, preferably less than five minutes, more preferably less than one minute even more preferably less than thirty seconds. The quick breaking of the foam or the bubbling action permits the spot to blotted up quickly, allowing the carpeted surface<br><br>
to be used in a shorter period of time over conventional foam-type carpet cleaners where the time for the foam to collapse is longer, making clean-up time longer.<br>
The foaming/bubbling composition is applied to the stained area on the carpet The instantaneous foam/bubble production causes the stain to be lifted to the surface of the carpet pile and then the foam collapses. The stain is brought to the surface of the   ■ carpet making it easier to blot and remove. While not being limited to this theory, it is believed that part of the good cleaning seen with the compositions of the present invention is due forces generated by the quick collapse of the foam, which causes the stains to lifted to the surface of the carpet,<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the removal of stains from carpets which comprises the step of applying an effective amount of the composition of the present invention to a carpet in need of such treatment<br>
The composition is typically prepared by mixing all the components together in a suitable container to form a concentrate, placing an amount of the concentrate In a suitable container useful to dispense aerosols, and then the propellant is added. For the examples below, a charge of the example formulation (equal to 94% of the finished product) is placed in a suitable canister and charged with 6% propellant Examples of compositions forming a part of the present invention are set forth below in Table 1 with the various components identified in Table 2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Certain compositions of Table 1 were evaluated in a cleaning test and were compared against a commercially available product 'Spot Shot" which is advertised as an instant carpet cleaner ("Commercial Product"). The Commercial Product is believed to contain about 5% propellant, about 16 to 17% solvent (butyl cellosolve), about 0.8% Monacor BE, about 0.26% sodium benzoate, about 0,15% nonyl phenol type non-ionic surfactant, the balance being water.<br>
The cleaning test that was conducted consisted of five stains cleaned with three compositions and five repetitions of each stain for each composition. The five stains tested were: Red Ink; Dirty Motor Oil; Red Wine; Spaghetti Sauce; and Coffee,<br><br>
The compositions tested were Ex. 1; Ex. 2; and Commercial Product.<br>
The test was conducted as follows: 6" x 6" swatches of carpet were stained with the appropriate amount of the appropriate product.<br>
Redlnk-2"x2"X<br>
Dirty Motor Oil-O.5g<br>
Red Wine -1.5g<br>
Spaghetti Sauce - 2.Og<br>
Coffee-1.5g<br>
The stains were allowed to dry for 24 hrs. in the room temperature chamber. Thereafter, approximately 9.5g of the appropriate composition were applied on each swatch. Then, each swatch was blotted by hand twice for a count of ten. The swatches were allowed to dry overnight in the room temp chamber. The swatches were visually scored based on a scale from 0-100. 0 = no soil removal and 100 = complete soil removal.<br>
The results were as follows:<br>
For Red Ink: Ex. 1 is statistically better than Ex, 2. Both examples were at parity with the Commercial Product.<br>
For Dirty Motor Oil: Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 were both at parity with the Commercial . Product.<br>
For Red Wine: Ex, 1 was at parity with Ex. 2, Both examples were prototypes were statistically better over the Commercial Product.<br>
For Spaghetti Sauce: Ex. 1 and Ex. 2 were both at parity with the Commercial<br><br>
For Coffee: Ex. 1 was at parity with Ex, 2 and the Commercial Product. The Commercial Product was statistically better than Ex. 2,<br><br><br><br><br><br>
