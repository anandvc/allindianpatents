FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel 1,2,4-thiadiazole derivatives useful<br>
for the treatment of a disorder mediated by a melanocortin receptor. More<br>
particularly, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment<br>
of metabolic, CNS and dermatologic disorders such as obesity, impaired oral<br>
glucose tolerance, elevated blood glucose levels, type II diabetes, Syndrome<br>
X, diabetic retinopathy, acute neurodegenerative disorders, chronic<br>
neurodegenerative disorders, plexopathies, male erectile dysfunction, dry eyes,<br>
acne, dry skin, aged skin, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, excessive ear wax,<br>
meibomian gland disorder, pseudofolliculitis, yeast infections, dandruff,<br>
hiradenitis suppurativa, ocular rosacea and eccrine gland disorder.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Melanocortins are neuropeptides that arise from proopiomelanocortin<br>
(POMC), which is most prevalently expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the<br>
hypothalamus, pituitary lobes, and the nucleus tractus solarius of the<br>
brainstem. [Gantz, I., et al., Molecular Cloning, Expression, and Gene<br>
Localization of a Fourth Melanocortin Receptor, J. Biolog. Chem., 1993, 268,<br>
15174-15179.] These peptides include ACTH, a-MSH, B-MSH, Y1.3-MSH, and<br>
synthetic analogue NDP-aMSH (Wikberg, J E S, Melanocortin receptors: new<br>
opportunities in drug discovery, Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, 2000,11(1), 61-76).<br>
These peptides bind to five types of melanocortin receptors (MC1-MC5),<br>
which are G-protein coupled receptors that all positively modulate adenylate<br>
cyclase. The MC4 and MC5 receptors are widely distributed in the brain and<br><br>
spinal cord, whereas the MC3 receptor is located mainly in the hypothalamus.<br>
[Gantz, I., et al., supra.] The MC4 receptor is selectively activated by cxMSH<br>
and can induce neurite outgrowth in Neuro 2A cells. (Adan RAH, et al.,<br>
Molecular Brian Research, 1996,36, pp 37-44; Mountjoy, K.G., Mortud, MX,<br>
Low, M.J., Simerly, R.B. and Cone, R.D., Mol. Endocrinol., 1994, 8, pp 1298-<br>
1308). ACHT is a less potent activator of the MC4 receptor than aMSH.<br>
(Adan, R.A.H., Cone, R.D., Burbach, J.P.H. and Gispen, W.H., mol.<br>
Pharmacol., 1994, 46, pp 1182-1190). The MC5 receptor is activated, in order<br>
of degree, by NDP ˜ a-MSH &gt; ACHT (1-24) &gt; a MSH ACHT (1-39) = ß MSH &gt;&gt;<br>
?MSH (The Melanocortin Receptors, Cone, R.D., Editor, Human Press Inc.,<br>
Totowa. N. J., 2000, Chen, W., pp449-472)<br>
In whole animals, studies in the rat sciatic nerve crush model have<br>
demonstrated that a-MSH increases neurite outgrowth and, as the most potent<br>
of the ACTH derived peptides, it significantly promotes nerve terminal<br>
branching, endplate area, and perimeter. [Bijlsma, W. A., et al., The Enhanced<br>
Recovery of Sensorimotor Function in Rats is Related to the Melantropic<br>
Moiety of ACTH/MSH Neuropeptides, Eur. J. Pharmacol, 1983, 92, 231-236;<br>
Van der Neut. R., et al., Stimulation by Melanocortins of Neurite Outgrowth<br>
from Spinal and Sensory Neurons In Vitro, Peptides, 1992,13,1109-1115; Van<br>
Der Zee, C. E. E. M., et al., a-MSH and Org 2766 in Peripheral Nerve<br>
Regeneration: Different Route of Delivery, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1988,147, 351-<br>
357; Strand, F. L., et al., Melanocortins as Factors in Somatic Neuromuscular<br>
Growth and Regrowth, Pharmac. Ther., 1994, 62, 1-27], Furthermore,<br>
recovery of motor function after nerve injury is shortened by application of o-<br>
MSH and other melanocortins. [Strand, F. L, et al., supra]<br>
Mice in which the MC4 receptor is rendered inactive by gene targeting<br>
become obese, suggesting that the MC4 receptor is involved in feeding.<br>
[Huszar, D., et al., Targeted Disruption of the Melanocortins Receptor Results<br>
in Mice, Cell, 1997, 88,131-141] This is substantiated by a report that various<br>
MC4 peptide agonists inhibit feeding behavior in agouti mice. [Fan, W., et al.,<br><br>
Role of Melanocortingenic Neurons in Feeding and the Agouti Obesity<br>
Syndrome, Nature, 1997, 385, 165-168]. a-MSH induces grooming behavior in<br>
rats, but the significance of this is not clear and may not be mediated via the<br>
MC4 receptor. [Adan, R. A. H., et al., Differential Effects of Melanocortin<br>
Peptides on Neural Melanocortin Receptors, Molecular Pharmacology, 1994,<br>
46,1182-1190).<br>
The melanocortins aMSH and ACTH are also known for their ability to<br>
stimulate pigmentation and adrenal glucocorticoid secretion, respectively. The<br>
role of melanocortins, particularly aMSH, in the regulation of sebaceous gland<br>
activity (an exocrine gland with holocrine type of secretion) was shown<br>
originally in rats. More particularly, the studies showed that removal of the<br>
intermediate lobe of the pituitary (which produces the POMC peptides) resulted<br>
in decreased sebaceous lipid production, with complete restoration to normal<br>
levels after replacement therapy with aMSH (Thody, A.J. and Shuster, Nature,<br>
237, 346-347,1972). In a study of rats following total hypophysectomy,<br>
treatment with aMSH resulted in an increase of sebum production, although full<br>
restoration of sebum production was achieved only after treatment with a<br>
combination of aMSH and testosterone (Thody, A.J., Shuster, S.. J. Endocr.<br>
64,503-610,1975; EbUng, F.J., Ebling, E., Randall. V. and Skinner, J., J.<br>
Endocr. 66, 407-412,1975). Knock-out mice where the MC5 receptor was<br>
deleted were observed to display a severe defect in water repulsion and<br>
thermo-regulation, due to decreased production of sebaceous lipids (Chen, W.<br>
Kelly, M.A., Opitz-Araya, X., Thomas, R.E., Low, M.J., and Cone, R., Cell, 91,<br>
788-798,1997).<br>
The MC5 receptor is known to be expressed in human sebaceous<br>
glands, and may be involved in the regulation of human sebaceous lipid<br>
synthesis. Human MC5-R has been cloned and characterized (Chhajlani, V.,<br>
Muceniece, R., Wikberg, JES., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 195, 866-<br>
873,1993). Moreover, presence of MC5-R m RNA in human sebaceous<br>
glands has been shown by RT-PCR and the protein was detected by<br><br>
immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis (Thiboutot, D., Sivarajah,<br>
Gililand, K., Cong, Z. and Clawson, G., J. Invest. Dermatol. 115(4). 614-619,<br>
2000).<br>
Human sebum differs in its composition from other mammals. The main<br>
lipids in human sebum are triglycerides, wax esters and squalene (Greene,<br>
R.S., Downing, D.T., Poci, P.E., Strauss, J.S., J/0 54, 240-247,1970).<br>
Squalene, for instance is not found in many mammals with the exception of<br>
otter and beaver. Triglyceride, which is a major component of human sebum is<br>
poorly represented in other species and in many (e.g. chimpanzee) appears to<br>
be totally absent (Thody, A.J., Shuster, S., Physiolog. Rev. 69, 383-415,1989).<br>
Moreover melanocortins can have different effects on cells from different<br>
species. For example both aMSH (EC50=3.7nM) and ACTH (EC50=16.4nM)<br>
are potent lipolytic agents for rabbit adipocytes, whereas in the rat only ACTH<br>
(EC50=1.34nM) has potent lipolytic activity (Ramachadran, J., Lee, V., 428,<br>
339-346,1987; Richter, W. O., Schwandt, P., Neuropeptides 9, 59-74,1987).<br>
Despite lipolytic activity in rodents and rabbits, ACTH has very little effect on<br>
lipolysis in isolated human and non-human primate adipocytes, even at<br>
concentrations as high as 1|iM (Ng, T.B. Comparative Biochem. 97,441-446,<br>
1990). Thus defining the role of melanocortins and their receptors in animal<br>
sebaceous model systems is not necessarily predictive of their role in a human<br>
sebaceous lipid regulation.<br>
Recently, Basu et.al., in WIPO publication W099/55679 disclosed<br>
isoquinoline derivatives, small molecule non-peptide compounds, which<br>
showed low micromolar affinities for the MC1 and MC4 receptors, reduction of<br>
dermal inflammation induced by arachidonic acids, and reductions of body<br>
weight and food intake.<br>
Nargund et. al., in WIPO publication WO99/64002 disclosed<br>
spiropiperidine derivatives as melanocortin receptor agonists, useful for the<br>
treatment of diseases and disorders such as obesity, diabetes and sexual<br>
dysfunction.<br><br>
Thus there exist a need for small molecule modulators of the<br>
melanocortin receptor, more particularly the melanocortin-3, melanocortin-4<br>
and / or the melanocortin-5 receptors.<br>

procedures described in Examples 4-11 herein. The present invention<br>
therefore provides a method of treating such disorders, which comprises<br>
administering any of the compounds as defined herein in a quantity effective to<br>
treat the disorder (i.e. in a therapeutically effective amount). The compound<br>
may be administered to a patient afflicted with such a disorder by any<br>
conventional route of administration, including, but not limited to, intravenous,<br>
oral, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, parenteral and transdermal.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprising one or more copounds of this invention in association with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or<br>
more compounds of formula (I) and/or (II) or a salt thereof (the active<br>
ingredient), is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to<br><br>
conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take<br>
a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for<br>
administration, e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may<br>
be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example,<br>
suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water,<br>
glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the<br>
like; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules,<br>
caplets, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches,<br>
sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules<br>
represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be<br>
sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the<br>
carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients, for<br>
example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be<br>
included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case<br>
appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed.<br>
Topical formulations included within the present invention, include but<br>
are not limited to creams, lotions, multiple emulsions, microemulsions,<br>
liposomal creams or gels, gels, solutions, suspensions, ointments, foaming<br>

Topical formulations for acne treatment included within the present<br>
invention may also contain one or more of the following components, including<br>
comedolytic/keratolytic agents, antimicrobial agents and steroidal or non-<br><br>
steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. (Comedolytic agents refer to any<br>
compound capable of rupturing a comedo. Keratolytic agents refer to any<br>
compound capable of breaking apart keratinocyes resulting in exfoliation of the<br>
epidermis.) Suitable comedolytic/keratofytic agents include, but are not limited<br>
to retinoids, salicylic acid, giycoiic acid, cetyl betaine, and the like. Suitable<br>
antimicrobial agents include, but are not limited to benzoyl peroxide,<br>
erythromycin, tetracycline, clindamycin, azelaic acid, and the like. Topical<br>
formulations typically contain 0.01-1% active ingredient.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit,<br>
e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of<br>
the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose as described<br>
above. The non-topical pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per<br>
unit dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository,<br>
teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.03 mg to 100 mg/kg (preferred 0.1-30<br>
mg/kg) and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.1-300 mg/kg/day<br>
(preferred 1-50 mg/kg/day). The dosages, however, may be varied depending<br>
upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated<br>
and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or<br>
post-periodic dosing may be employed.<br>
Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as<br>
tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or<br>
suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector<br>
devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal<br>
administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively,<br>
the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-<br>
monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound<br>
such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for<br>
intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the<br>
principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g.<br>
conventional tableting ingredients such as com starch, lactose, sucrose,<br>
sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums,<br><br>
and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation<br>
composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present<br>
invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to<br>
these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the<br>
composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms<br>
such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is<br>
then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing<br>
from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The<br>
tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise<br>
compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged<br>
action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the<br>
former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which<br>
serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component<br>
to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of<br>
material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials<br>
including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl<br>
alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present<br>
invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include,<br>
aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and<br>
flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil,<br>
coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.<br>
Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include<br>
synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran,<br>
sodium carboxymeth/lcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or<br>
gelatin.<br>
The method of treating disorders mediated by a melanocortin receptor<br>
described in the present invention may also be carried out using a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds as defined herein<br><br>
and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. The non-topical pharmaceutical<br>
composition may contain between about 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably about<br>
5 to 50 mg, of the compound, and may be constituted into any form suitable for<br>
the mode of administration selected, earners include necessary and inert<br>
pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending<br>
agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings.<br>
Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills,<br>
tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and<br>
sustained release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such<br>
as solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for<br>
parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be<br>
administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be<br>
administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore,<br>
compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via<br>
topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a<br>
transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be<br>
continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the<br>
active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover,<br>
when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents<br>
and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders<br>
include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or<br>
beta-lactose, com sweeteners, natural and syndetic gums such as acacia,<br>
tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium<br>
benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include,<br>
without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonfte, xanthan gum and the<br>
like.<br><br>
The liquid forms in suitably flavored suspending or dispersing agents such<br>
as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-<br>
cellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and<br>
solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable<br>
preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired.<br>
The compound of the present invention can also be administered in the<br>
form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large<br>
unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from<br>
a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine or<br>
phophatidylcholines.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may also be delivered by the use of<br>
monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules<br>
are coupled. The compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with<br>
soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol,<br>
polyhydroxy-ethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyl eneoxidepolylysine substituted<br>
with palmitoyl residue. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention<br>
may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving<br>
controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polyepsilon<br>
caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyeric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals,<br>
polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block<br>
copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing<br>
compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever<br>
treatment of disorders mediated by a melanocortin receptor is required.<br>
The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from<br>
0.01 to 1,000 mg per adult human per day. For oral administration, the<br>
compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01,0.05,<br>
0.1, 0.5,1.0,2.5, 5.0,10.0,15.0, 25.0, 50.0,100,150, 200, 250 and 500<br><br>
milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage<br>
to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied<br>
at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight<br>
per day. Preferably, the range is from about 0.03 to about 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4<br>
times per day.<br>
Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of<br>
administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and<br>
the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with<br>
the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of<br>
administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages.<br>

Proximity Assay beads [purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Inc.] for 30 min<br>
at 25°C. Into each well of a 96-well Opti plate [purchased from Packard, CA],<br>
2.5 ug of membrane and 0.25 mg of beads were mixed in a volume of 100 |iL<br>
media. The media was 50mM HEPES, pH 7.4 containing 0.1 % bovine serum<br>
albumin, 2 mM CaCb, 2 mM MgCfe and protease inhibitors. Test compounds<br>
(1.5 nL) at 1mM in 30% DMSO-50mM HEPES, pH 7.4 buffer was added to<br>
separate wells on the plate. Radioactive ligand 125l-NDP-meianocyte<br>
stimulating hormone [NEN, 2000Ci/mmol] was added to each well (48.5 u.L per<br>
well, 40 pM final concentration). The plate was then sealed and let stand for 16<br>

Rodent Feeding: Food Intake in Food-Deprived Rats (MC-4)<br>
Male Long-Evans rats (180-200 grams) were housed individually and<br>
maintained on a once-a-day feeding schedule (i.e.10 a.m. until 4 p.m.) for five<br>
days following quarantine to allow the animals to acclimate to feeding on<br>
powdered chow (#5002 PMI Certified Rodent Meal) during the allotted time.<br>
The chow was made available in an open jar, anchored in the cage by a wire,<br>
with a metal follower covering the food to minimize spillage. Water was<br>
available ad-libitum.<br>
Animals were fasted for 18 hours prior to testing. At the end of the<br>
fasting period, animals were administered either a test compound or vehicle.<br>
Vehicle and test compound were administered either orally (5 mL/kg) 60<br>
minutes prior to the experiment, subcutaneously (1 mL/kg) 30 minutes prior to<br>
the experiment, or intraperitoneally (1 mL/kg) 30 minutes prior to the<br>
experiment. Test compounds were administered orally as a suspension in<br>
aqueous 0.5% methylcellulose-0.4% Tween 80, or intraperitoneally as a<br>
solution or suspension in PEG 200; compound concentrations typically ranged<br>
from 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, preferably from 10-30 mg/kg. Food intake was<br>
measured at 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration by weighing the special jar<br>
containing the food before the experiment and at the specified times. Upon<br>
completion of the experiment, all animals were given a one-week washout<br>
period before re-testing.<br>
Following the procedure described above, select compounds of the<br>
present invention were tested to measure the effect on food intake in fasted rats,<br>
as listed in Table 5 and 6.<br>

Neurite Cell Outgrowth Assay<br>
Cell Culture:<br>
Dissociated hippocampal and cortical cell cultures were established<br>
from embryonic day 18 rat fetuses as described by Mattson, MP., Barger,<br>
S.W., Begley, J, and Mark, R.J., Methods Cell Biol., 1994, 46:087-216. Briefly,<br>
fetuses were removed via cesarean section from pregnant moms (Sprague-<br>
Dawley) and anesthetized with halothane according to the AVMA Panel on<br>
Euthanasia. Pups were decapitated and the brains were removed and placed<br>
in HEPES-buffered Hank's Balanced Salt solution (HBSS; Gibco). The<br>
hippocampi and cortices were dissected out and pooled according to tissue-<br>
type. Tissue was trypsinized for 15 min (1mg/ml trypsin-HBSS; Worthington),<br>
rinsed with fresh HBSS, incubated in trypsin inhibitor (1mg/ml; Sigma) for 5<br>
min, rinsed again with fresh HBSS and then triturated in 1ml fresh HBSS with a<br>
fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociated cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well<br>
onto poly-D-lysine coated 96-well plates (Collaborative BioScience). Each well<br>
contained 100µl of Eagle's Minimal Essential Media (MEM; Gibco)<br>
supplemented with 26mM NaHCO3 (Sigma), 56mM glucose (Sigma), 15mM<br>
KCI (Sigma), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 1.1mM L-glutamine (Sigma), 10%<br>
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 0.001% gentamicin<br>
sulfate (Sigma) (pH 7.4). Cells were allowed to attach for 24h in a humidified<br>
37ºC 5% CO2 incubator before experimental treatment. The culture media was<br>
aspirated and exchanged with fresh media every 3 days.<br>
Assay:<br>
Twenty-four hours after plating, cultures were treated with vehicle<br>
(PBS+0.1% BSA), alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (a-MSH) or test<br>
compound (diluted in DPBS). Each treatment condition was run in<br>
quadruplicate. On the third day in culture, the media was aspirated off and<br>
replaced with fresh media and test compound. At one week in culture, the<br>
cells were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 15min, then rinsed<br>
with DPBS (Sigma) and placed in blocking serum for 30 min (horse serum;<br>
1:50 dilution in DPBS; Vector Labs). The cultures were rinsed again with<br>
DPBS and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 hr (microtubule-associated<br>
protein-2 (MAP-2) is a selective marker for dendritic processes; anti-mouse<br>
monoclonal (Chemicon); 1:1000 dilution of MAP-2 in antibody diluent (Zymed)).<br>
Negative control wells were incubated in antibody diluent alone. Background<br>
signal was determined by blank wells (cell-free) incubated with or without<br>
antibody. Cultures were rinsed again with DPBS and then placed in<br>
fluorescein for 1 hr (FITC; anti-mouse IgG; rat adsorbed; 1:50 dilution in DPBS;<br>
Vector Labs). Cultures were rinsed a final time with DPBS and the plates were<br>
then read on a Cytofluor 4000 fluorescence plate reader. Neurite outgrowth<br>
was expressed as percent change from control (vehicle).<br>
Selected compounds of the instant invention were tested in the above<br>
assay with results as listed in Table 7. The data are expressed as percent<br>
change over the vehicle response. All compounds were screened at 50nM. The<br>
abbreviation NA indicates no change / not active; the abbreviation ND indicates a<br>
compound not tested / response not determined.<br>
The data above show that cultures treated with select compounds of the<br>
present invention resulted in a significant increase in neurite outgrowth as<br>
measured by MAP2-FITC immunofluorescence. A comparison between the test<br>
compounds and a-MSH indicates that many of the test compounds were<br>
superior to a-MSH in promoting neurite outgrowth at the concentration tested. In<br>
addition, several of the test compounds displayed selective effects on neurite<br>
outgrowth in hippocampal or cortical cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
In vivo Facial Nerve Compression Model<br>
The ability of test compound to provide neuro-protective or neuro-<br>
regenerative effects was investigated in a facial nerve compression model.<br>
Facial nerve motor axons arise exclusively from neurons within the pons in a<br>
well-defined nucleus. Facial nerve compression results in retrograde reactions<br>
proximal to the lesion site and Wallerian degeneration at its distal part, which<br>
causes diminished whisker movement on the lesioned side.<br>
Male Long-Evans rats (150-180 g) were anesthetized with 3-5%<br>
isoflorane for induction and 2% for maintenance during the surgical<br>
procedures. The right facial nerve was exposed and compressed with forceps<br>
for 30 sec at its exit from the stylomastoid foramen. The left facial nerve was<br>
sham-operated and served as an internal control. Nerve compression causes<br>
paralysis of whisker muscles, hence the reduced whisker movement on the<br>
Iesioned side, which is observed immediately after recovery from anesthesia.<br>
The following morphological abnormalities associated with the functional deficit<br>
were observed:<br>
(1) an increase in the number of perineuronal glial cells in the facial<br>
nucleus of the Iesioned side, with the increased observed to peak around D3-6;<br>
(2) a thinner myelin sheath and less myelin basic protein staining in the<br>
compressed facial nerve approximately one week after the lesion;<br>
(3) morphological alterations around the N-M junction and whisker<br>
follicles regions and gradually degeneration of motor neurons in the facial<br>
nuclei.<br><br>
After recovery from anesthesia, the rats were randomly divided into<br>
groups for dosing with vehicle, aMSH or test compound, with 6 animals per<br>
group. aMSH (s.c., 70µg/each 48hr) was used as a positive control. Test<br>
compounds were dosed p.o. at 20mg/kg bid for 14 days. Restoration of<br>
whisker movement was monitored daily after the operation using two criteria:<br>
(1) frequency of whisker movement on the lesioned side relative to the<br>
the opposite side (sham-operated) which served as the baseline control<br>
(2) semi-quantitative measurements (0 to 4+) on strength of the whisker<br>
muscles, characterized based on observation of the percentage of moved<br>
whiskers, muscle tone of whisker muscles, and the position of the nose.<br>
For all observations, the experimental design was blind to the behavioral<br>
observer.<br>
The results of behavioral assessment showed that both test<br>
compounds, compounds #31 and #84, accelerated the recovery time to restore<br>
whisker muscle movement in the lesioned rats as compared to the vehicle<br>
controls (p
as percentage of its own internal control (sham-operated), as listed in Table 8.<br>

postoperative pieces of human skin at 0.4-0.8mm depths (this part of the skin<br>
was previously shown to be enriched in sebaceous glands). Shavings so<br>
obtained were treated with 1% Dispase in Iscoves medium containing 10%<br>
serum for 20 min at 37°C. The tissue was then placed in 0.3% trypsin/1%<br>
EDTA in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) for 10 minutes at 37°C. Following<br>
this incubation the cells were gently scraped from the tissue in Growth medium<br>
(GM) containing OMEM/F12 media mixture (3:1), supplemented with 8% heat<br>
inactivated PBS, 2% heat inactivated human serum (HS), 1mM sodium<br>
pyruvate, epidermal growth factor (10ng/ml), insulin (10µg /ml), hydrocortisone<br>
(0.4µg/ml) and +/-cholera toxin (100µg/ml), L-glutamine and antibiotics.<br>
Cells so obtained were filtered through nylon mesh (100µ pore size),<br>
centrifuged at 750 RPM, re-suspended in GM and counted.<br>
Resultant cells from the above isolation procedure were plated on the<br>
3T3 feeder layers at 2x105/9.5cm2 in growth medium and maintained at 37°C<br>
and 5% CO2 for 3days (Phase I). Following the initial growth period they were<br>
transferred to a transition medium (TM) that consisted of DMEM/F12 media<br>
supplemented with 1mM sodium pyruvate, insulin (10µg/ml), transferrin<br>
(6.7µg/ml) and selenium (5.5µg/ml) (ITS), 2% heat inactivated FBS and 2%<br>
heat inactivated human serum as well as +/- cholera toxin (ch.t.) (100µg/ml), L-<br>
glutamine and antibiotics (Phase II). Three days later the cells were changed<br>
to differentiation medium (DM), DMEM/F12 supplemented with ITS, 3,3',5-<br>
triido-L-thyronine sodium(3nM), 1 %(v/v) trace element mix and the choice of<br>
differentiation agent i.e. bovine pituitary extract (10µg/ml). This medium was<br>
changed every 3 days (Phase III).<br>
STEP D: Testing Stimulators or Inhibitors of Sebocyte Differentiation and Lipid<br>
Production<br>
Hormones, mixture of hormones i.e. bovine pituitary extract or<br>
compounds to be tested were added to the culture at the beginning of phase<br>
III. Two criteria were used to evaluate the effect of these materials on<br>
sebaceous cultures: 1) visual observations and 2) evaluation of sebaceous lipid<br>
accumulation and synthesis. The evaluation of lipid accumulation completed<br>
using the Nile red method. This method relies on visualization of neutral lipids<br>
by Nile red and quantitation by reading of fluorescence at 535 nm excitation,<br>
580 nm emission using a plate reader. The lipid synthesis was evaluated by<br>
radioactive labeling using 14C acetate and quantified by Bio Rad<br>
Phosphoimager (Molecular Imager, FX) using 4.1 Software.<br>
STEP E: Visual observations &amp; Nile Red evaluation of lipid accumulation<br>
Morphological evaluation of lipid accumulation was easily recognized<br>
since the cells enlarged and displayed lipid granules that in bright field light<br>
microscopy appeared as yellowish circles in the cells. Quantitation of<br>
accumulation/inhibition of neutral lipids in sebocytes was accomplished by Nile<br>
red binding assay. Briefly, following exposure of sebocytes to test compounds,<br>
the cells were allowed to interact with 1µM Nile red in Hanks buffered saline<br><br>
solution containing DMSO and Pluronic F127. After 4 hours of incubation,<br>
washing and incubation overnight, the fluorescence was read at 535 excitation<br>
and 580 emission using a fluorescence plate reader. To determine whether<br>
the compounds had an inhibitory effect on cell growth, cell counts were<br>
performed.<br>
Following the procedure described above, select compounds of the<br>
present invention were tested for visual and Nile red evaluation of lipid<br>
accumulation, with results as listed in Table 9.<br>
STEP F: Evaluation of sebaceous lipid synthesis by sebaceous cells<br>
At day 11 of the culture, sebocytes were labeled with 14C acetate at a<br>
final concentration of 2µCi/ml for 24 hours in serum free culture medium. The<br>
cells were than scraped from plates and frozen at -80°C in glass vials. Lipid<br>
extraction was completed using the Bligh- Dyer method (Bligh, E.G. and Dyer,<br>
W.J., Can. J. Biochem. Physiol., 1959, 37, pp 911-916) with slight modification<br>
as detailed herein. Briefly, cells were homogenized in a 2:1 chloroform-<br>
methanol mixture, in the presence of KCI. The organic phase was removed<br>
from the mixture, the separated lipids were dried under argon and spotted to<br>
high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) plates. The plates were<br>
developed by three separate mobile phases. The first was hexane (to the top<br>
of the plate), followed by toluene (to the top) and finally a 70:30:1 mixture of<br>
hexane : ether: acetic acid (half way up the plate-10cm). The plates were than<br>
exposed to radiographic film for visualization of radioactive lipid species. For<br>
visualization of unlabeled lipids the plates were sprayed with 8% cupric acid<br>
and charred on a hot plate. Quantitation of the results was done by Image Pro<br>
Plus 3.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD).<br>
Following the procedure described above, select compounds of the<br>
present invention were tested for their inhibitory effect on differentiation of<br>
human sebocytes. Visually, the stained cell cultures treated with compound<br>
#74 showed complete disappearance of lipid granules in sebocyte cultures<br>
following a seven day treatment. The same cells examined for lipid synthesis<br>
revealed inhibition of squalene, cholesterol esters and wax esters, as<br>
measured by radioactively labeled lipids separated by HPTLC. The cell panels<br>
were quantified by measurement of the intensity of bands using Image Pro<br>
Plus (version 5.0). % inhibition was calculated based on the difference<br>
between treated samples and vehicle treated controls, with results as listed in<br>
Table 10.<br>
In Vivo Evaluation of the Test Compound Effect on Sebum Production:<br>
Human Skin - SCID Mouse Chimera Model<br>
Severe combined immunodeficient mice (SCID) provide an invaluable<br>
model for skin xenografting. These animals are devoid of both T and B cell<br>
immunity. Human skin grafts in SCID mice retain human cellular tissue<br>
components including skin immune cells, i.e. Langerhans cells, macrophages<br>
and lymphocytes and also part of the engrafted endothelium ( Kaufman R.,et<br>
al., Exp. Dermatol. 1993: 2: 209-216,1993). These properties allow for the<br>
study of physiological and/or pathological responses of human skin cells to a<br>
test compound.<br>
STEP A: Method of transplantation:<br>
C.B-17 scid/scid mice (Taconic, Germantown, N.Y.) were used for<br>
grafting at 5-6 weeks of age. Full thickness human facial skin was shaved to<br>
-0.4 mm using a Forman Dermatome. The skin shavings were washed 3<br>
times in antibiotics and antimycotics (penicillin, streptomycin, fungizone) (Life<br>
technologies) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life<br>
Technologies). Eliptical skin - 2.0-2.5x1.0-1.5 was grafted onto the prepared<br>
graft bed and sutured using 4.0 silk. During surgical procedures the mice were<br>
anaesthetized using a mixture of Ketaset (0.16 mg/g body weight) and Rompun<br>
(8.0 µg/g body weight).<br>
It is well accepted that the wound healing process of the transplanted<br>
skin in the SCID mouse takes one month, at which time the human skin can be<br>
used for experimental purposes. We also found that there is a gradual<br>
regeneration of sebaceous glands in the transplanted human skin and that<br>
these glands are fully regenerated and secrete sebum at 7 weeks as shown by<br>
Sebutape and histo-morphometry. Maximum size of the glands was observed 3<br>
month post transplantation. The glands retained their capability to produce<br>
human specific sebum and the glandular tissue expressed human specific<br>
markers including MC5-R. Since glands reached their maximum size at 2-3<br>
month post transplantation the effects of inhibitors of sebum secretion was<br>
tested at this point.<br><br>
STEP B: Method of treatment:<br>
Mice at 2-3 month post transplantation with human facial skin were used<br>
for the studies. The graft area was treated with the test compound at the<br>
desired concentration(s) dissolved in polyethylene glycol-ethanol (20 µl/2 cm2).<br>
Controls were treated with vehicle alone. The test compounds were applied<br>
daily, excluding weekends. Sebum secretion was determined using Sebutape<br>
at 15 days and 30 days following treatment.<br>
STEP C: Termination of the experiment:<br>
The termination of the experiment was determined by preliminary clinical<br>
evaluation of sebum production using SEBUTAPE. At this time human skin<br>
grafts were excised and representative samples were collected for histological<br>
evaluation. More particularly, 2mm punch biopsies were prepared and used for<br>
evaluation of lipid synthesis and total lipid accumulation in the treated tissues.<br>
STEP D: Evaluation of lipid synthesis and total lipid accumulation in the<br>
examined tissues.<br>
The collected 2mm punch biopsies were placed individually into 96 well<br>
plates in Krebs buffer and labeled with 10µCi of 14C acetate for 3 hours.<br>
Following this labeling period the samples were washed in medium and 5<br>
biopsies pooled, weighed, and used for lipid extraction. The lipid extraction and<br>
analysis by HPTLC was the same as described for tissue culture derived cells.<br>
Following the procedure described above, compound #74 of the present<br>
invention was tested for the inhibition of sebaceous gland activity following 11<br>
day treatment of human skin transplanted to the SCID mouse.<br>
Visual evaluation of the sebaceous gland following topical treatment with<br>
0.1% solution of compound #74 resulted in visible shrinkage of the sebaceous<br>
gland and down regulation of sebaceous lipids. Topical treatment for 15 days<br>
with 0.05% and 0.005% solutions was not sufficient to down regulate the lipids.<br>
Numerical evaluation of the inhibition of human sebaceous lipids for these<br>
cells was analyzed using HPTLC, with results as listed in Table 11,12 and 13.<br>
%lnhibition numbers are listed relative to control.<br>
As shown in Tables 12 and 13 above, both total sebaceous lipid<br>
accumulation and de novo synthesis of sebaceous lipids was significantly<br>
decreased following 30 days of topical treatment with an 0.05% and 0.01%<br>
solution of compound #74.<br><br>
