				<td>A NONIONIC SURFACTANT COMPRISING AN ALIPHATIC ALCOHOL ALKYLENE OXIDE<br>
ADDUCT, A PROCESS THEREOF, AN ANIONIC SURFACTANT, AND DETERGENT<br>
COMPOSITION<br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel nonionic<br>
surfactant, an anionic surfactant anionizing it and a detergent<br>
composition. More specifically, the invention relates to<br>
non-alkylphenol type nonionic and anionic surfactants.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts,<br>
obtained by addition-polymerizing an alkylene oxide with<br>
aliphatic alcohols in the presence of a basic catalyst or an<br>
acidic catalyst, and anionized products thereof have been known<br>
as various surfactants, solvents, intermediates for chemicals.<br>
As compared with alkylphenol-based nonionic surfactants,<br>
aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts known heretofore,<br>
however, do not manifest sufficient surface activity in some<br>
case, for instance, result in insufficient emulsifiability,<br>
emulsion stability and low-foaming properties when used as<br>
emulsifiers. With respect to anionized products of aliphatic<br>
alcohol alkylene oxide adducts, there have been remained<br>
problems of foaming properties, detergency, stability with time<br>
of products and irritation to human skin.<br>
In addition, there has been known a method using<br>
perchlorates as catalysts for addition of an alkylene oxide (US<br>
Patent No.4, 112, 231). This method has not yet become<br>
industrially used; since the catalysts are of low catalytic<br>
activity, and, when used in an increased amount to shorten the<br>
reaction time, they cause problems such that the resulting<br>
product severely discolored to result in worsened product<br>
appearance and that the product contains aldehyde in high<br>
contens.<br>
The inventors have devoted deep study to resolve the above<br>
problems, and have found that nonionic surfactants comprising<br>
aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts having a specific<br>
composition and a specific molecular weight distribution<br>
exhibit excellent emulsifiability and detergency. Besides,<br>
they have found that such aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide<br>
adducts can be directly produced by using two specific catalysts<br>
in combination to reach the present invention. Further, it has<br>
been found that products obtained by anionizing the resulting<br>
aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts have improved foaming<br>
properties, detergency, stability with time of products and<br>
irritation to human skin.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an<br>
aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct, having surface<br>
activities comparable to alkylphenol-based nonionic<br>
surfactants and moreover having no fear of environmental<br>
endocrine disrupters like alkylphenol-based nonionic<br>
surfactants.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide an<br>
anionic surfactant having improved foaming properties,<br>
detergency, stability with time of products and irritation to<br>
human skin by anionizing an aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide<br>
adduct.<br>
It is still another object of this invention to provide<br>
a detergent composition using the above anionic surfactant and<br>
having excellent detergency.<br>

DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
(I) Nonionic Surfactant<br>
In the invention of the above (I), said aliphatic alcohol<br>
alkyiene oxide adduct (A) is one or a mixture of two or more<br>
of an aliphatic alcohol alkyiene oxide adduct directly produced<br>
by adding an alkyiene oxide (b1) to an aliphatic alcohol (a1)<br>
(In this specification, "aliphatic alcohol" is defined as<br>
including both aliphatic alcohol and cycloaliphatic alcohol.).<br>
The term "directly produced" used herein means that said<br>
adducts are directly produced without any operation for<br>
fractionating unreacted alcohol or adducts of different<br>
addition molar numbers, such as through fractional distillation.<br>
Ones requiring fractionation are of no practical use to be used<br>
as usual nonionic surfactants, because of complicated process.<br>
But, ones obtained by stripping low-boiling matters or<br>
unreacted alcohol with easy operation not for the purpose of<br>
fractionation are not included.<br>
The above (A) comprises one represented by the following<br>
general formula (1) or a mixture of two or more thereof.<br><br>
In the above formula (1) , R1 is a residue of an aliphatic<br>
alcohol (a1) , and represents an aliphatic hydrocarbon group or<br>
a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon group, containing usually 8-24<br>
(preferably 12-18) carbon atoms. Desirable emulsifiability,<br>
solubilizing power and detergency are not attained if carbon<br>
atoms in R1 are less then 8; while carbon atoms in R1 exceeding<br>
24 is not preferred with respect to handling because of<br>
increased pouring point of the resulting alkylene oxide adduct.<br>
The above aliphatic hydrocarbon groups include straight-chain<br>
or branched, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
groups (alkyl, alkenyl and alkadienyl groups); and the above<br>
cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon groups include cycloalkyl groups<br>
and polycyclic hydrocarbon groups.<br>
Concrete examples of R1 include alkyl groups, such as octyl,<br>
nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, hexa-decyl,<br>
octadecyl, nonadecyl, 2-ethylhexyl and 2-ethyloctyl groups.<br>
Illustrative of alkenyl groups are octenyl, decenyl, dodecenyl,<br>
tridecenyl, pentadecenyl, oleyl and gadoleyl groups.<br>
Alkadienyl groups are inclusive of linoleyl group. Exemplary<br>
of cycloalkyl groups are ethylcyclohexyl, propylcyclohexyl,<br>
octylcyclohexyl and nonylcyclohexyl groups. Polycyclic<br>
hydrocarbon groups include, for example, adamantyl group.<br>
Aliphatic alcohols (a1) used in this invention, providing<br>
the residue R, are alcohols containing usually 8-24<br>
(preferably 12-18) carbon atoms and may be natural alcohols or<br>
synthetic alcohols (such as Ziegler alcohols and oxo alcohols) .<br>
Illustrative examples include saturated aliphatic<br>
alcohols, such as octyl alcohol, nonyl alcohol, decyl alcohol,<br>
undecyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, tetradecyl<br>
alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, octadecyl alcohol and nonadecyl<br>
alcohol; unsaturated aliphatic alcohols, such as octenyl<br>
alcohol, decenyl alcohol, dodecenyl alcohol, tridecenyl<br>
alcohol, pentadecenyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, gadoleyl alcohol<br>
and linoleyl alcohol; cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as<br>
ethylcyclohexyl alcohol, propylcyclohexyl alcohol,<br>
octylcyclohexyl alcohol, nonylcyclohexyl alcohol and<br>
adamantyl alcohol. There may be used one or two or more of these.<br>
Among these aliphatic alcohols, preferred are primary or<br>
secondary ones and more preferred are primary ones. Besides,<br>
the alkyl group moiety may be linear or branched. Particularly<br>
preferred are dodecyl alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, tetradecyl<br>
alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol and octadecyl alcohol.<br>
In the above formula (1), the part of (C2H4O) is formed<br>
by addition of ethylene oxide (hereinafter referred to as EO).<br>
A represents an alkylene group containing at least 3 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably 3-8 carbon atoms, particularly preferably 3<br>
carbon atoms. The part of (AO) is formed by addition of an<br>
alkylene oxide containing at least 3 carbon atoms. As such an<br>
alkylene oxide, there may be mentioned propylene oxide<br>
(hereinafter referred to as PO) , 1,2- or 2,3-butylene oxide,<br>
tetrahydrofran, styrene oxide and the like. Preferred is PO.<br>
In the above general formula (1) , m is 0 or an integer of<br>
1 or more, giving an average of usually 0-4, preferably 0-3,<br>
particularly 1-3. In general, n is 0 or an integer of 1 or more,<br>
giving an average of usually 0-3, and is preferably 0, 1 or 2.<br>
Usually, p is 0 or an integer of 1 or more, giving an average<br>
of 1-80, preferably 2-70, more preferably 3-40, most preferably<br>
3-20. When it exceeds 80, sufficient emulsifying and<br>
solubilizing effects are not attained because of too high<br>
hydrophilcity and desired penetrativity is not obtained because<br>
of too large molecules. In the above general formula (1), n is<br>
preferably 0 or an integer of 1 or more, giving an average of<br>
usually 1-3.<br>
Generally, (m+n+p) is an integer, the average thereof<br>
being in the range of 3-81, preferably 3-71, more preferably<br>
3-41. If it exceeds 81, sufficient emulsifying and solubilizing<br>
effects are not attained because of too high hydrophilcity and<br>
desired penetrativity is not obtained because of too large<br>
molecules. The ratio (m+p)/(m+n+p) is usually at least 0.5,<br>
preferably 0.7-0.99. The ratio less than 0.5 results in poor<br>
emulsifying effects. The part of { (C2H4Q) m/(AQ)n} may be block<br>
addition [in the order of (C2H4O)m and then (AO)n] or random<br>
addition. Preferred is block addition.<br>
Weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the aliphatic<br>
alcohol alkylene oxide adduct (A) obtained in the invention (I)<br>
is preferably 261-5,000, particularly 300-1,200. When it is<br>
261-5,000, surface activities, such as penetrating power, are<br>
particularly good and preferred. [Measurrnent of molecular<br>
weight is according to gel permeation chromatography (GPC),<br>
hereinafter these are defined as the same.]<br>
It is necessary that the ratio Mw/Mn of Mw to number-<br>
average molecular weight (Mn) of (A) satisfies the following<br>
relation (2) or (3) .<br>
Mw/Mn=0.030XLn(v)+1.010 (in case of v
Mw/Mn=-0.026XLn(v)+1.139 (in case of v=10) (3)<br>
In these relations, Ln(v) represents natural logarithm of<br>
v, and v represents the average number of addition moles of<br>
alkylene oxide (b1) added per 1 mole of aliphatic alcohol (a1),<br>
corresponding to average of the total of m, n and p which are<br>
numbers of addition moles of each alkylene oxide in the above<br>
general formula (1) .<br>
Sufficient surface activities are not attained, if the<br>
relation (2) or (3) is not satisfied, namely when the molecular<br>
weight distribution becomes broader.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the ratio Mw/Mn satisfies<br>
the following relation (2') or (3').<br>
Mw/Mn=O. 031XLn(v)+1.000 (in case of v
Mw/Mn=-0.026XLn(v)+1.129 (in case of v=10) (3')<br>
Further, when it is possible to determine a distribution<br>
constant (c) by the following equation (4) derived from the<br>
following equation (5) of Weibull distribution law, it is<br>
necessary that (c) is not more than 1.0. Preferably, c is not<br>
more than 0.9, more preferably not more than 0.7. In the equation<br>
(4) , the smaller is the value of distribution constant (c) , that<br>
is, the smaller is the content of unreacted aliphatic alcohol,<br>
the narrower is the molecular weight distribution.<br>
This equation is applicable to the case where the content<br>
of unreacted aliphatic alcohol (a1) is not less than the limit<br>
of detection (e.g. 0.001 % by weight); and, in the case of (A),<br>
it is applicable up to such a level of 12 moles of the average<br>
number of addition moles of alkylene oxide (b1).<br>
Sufficient surface activities are not attained, if c<br>
exceeds 1.<br><br>
In these equations, Ln(noo/no) represents natural<br>
logarithm of (noo/no) , v is defined above and n00 represents the<br>
molar number of the aliphatic alcohol (a1) used in the reaction,<br>
and n0 represents the molar number of the aliphatic alcohol (a1)<br>
unreacted.<br>
In the case of n in the general formula (1) being 0, that<br>
is, in the case where only ethylene oxide is added to aliphatic<br>
alcohol (a1), it is preferred that the ratio Mw/Mn of<br>
weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to number-average<br>
molecular weight (Mn) satisfies the following relation (6) or<br>
(7) instead of relation (2) or (3).<br>
Mw/Mn=0.020XLn(v)+1.010 (in case of v
Mw/Mn=-0.026XLn(v)+1.116 (in case of v=10) (7)<br>
In the above, v represents the average number of addition<br>
moles of ethylene oxide (b1) added per 1 mole of aliphatic<br>
alcohol (a1) , corresponding to the average of (m+p) in the above<br>
general formula (1).<br>
Sufficient surface activities are noL attained, if the<br>
relation (6) or (7) is not satisfied, namely when the molecular<br>
weight distribution becomes broader.<br>
In addition, it is preferred that the ratio Mw/Mn satisfies<br>
the following relation (6') or (7').<br>
Mw/Mn=0.018XLn(v)+1.015 (in case of v
Mw/Mn=-0.023XLn(v)+1.113 (in case of v=10) (7')<br>
Among surfactants comprising the aliphatic alcohol<br>
alkylene oxide adduct (A) of the present invention, preferred<br>
are ones comprising (A) whose HLB is in the range of 5-13<br>
(particularly 6-12) and having an emulsifying index s for a<br>
mineral oil of at least 8 (particularly at least 9) , in view<br>
of especially good emulsifying effects to highly hydrophobic<br>
materials. Illustrative of preferable ones are those (A), in<br>
the formula (1), R1 being an aliphatic hydrocarbon group<br>
containing 10-20 carbon atoms, m being 1-3 on the average, n<br>
being 0-2 on the average, and p being 1-5 on the average.<br>
Particularly preferred are those (A) , R1 being an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon group containing 12-18 carbon atoms, m being 1-<br>
3 on the average, n being 0-1 on the average, and p being 1-3<br>
on the average. In the above and hereinafter, HLB means<br>
Griffin's HLB according to the following equation (8).<br>
Griffin's HLB= (Molecular weight of EO moieties in the<br>
surfactant/Molecular weight of the<br>
surfactant) X20 (8)<br>
Herein, said emulsifying index s for a mineral oil, in case<br>
of using the surfactant of this invention as an emulsifier, is<br>
measured in accordance with the following method.<br>
Three parts by weight of an emulsifier comprising a<br>
nonionic surfactant is blended with 97 parts by weight of a.<br>
mineral oil having an aniline point of 70°C and a viscosity of<br>
15-25mPa.s at 25°C; and 5 parts by weight of the blend is thrown<br>
into a 100 ml measuring cylinder with a cap charged with 95 parts<br>
by weight of deionized water temperature-conditioned to 25°C.<br>
Then the measuring cylinder is shaken 20 times up and down, and<br>
is allowed to stand at 25°C. Upon observing emulsified state<br>
after 60 minutes, emulsifying index s is expressed according<br>
to grades evaluated on the basis below.<br>
10: the state of being wholly emulsified homogeneously.<br>

Nonionic surfactants of this invention exhibit excellent<br>
performances, with respect to emulsifiability, emulsion<br>

uses, for example, emulsifiers (I), such as emulsifiers for<br>
metal working, emulsifiers for agrochemical emulsions,<br>
emulsifiers for cosmetics, emulsifiers for aqueous coatings and<br>
emulsifiers for emulsion polymerization. To be concrete, they<br>
can be used as emulsifiers for producing 0/W or W/0 emulsions<br>

In case using said aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct<br>
(A) of the present invention as emulsifiers (I), dispersants<br>
(J) or solubilizers (K) , it is preferred that p in the formula<br>
(I) is such an integer of 2-40 on the average. If it exceeds<br>
40, the resulting product is too hydrophylic and unpreferable<br>
as emulsifier, dispersant or solubilizer. Besides, Mw of (A),<br>
when used in the above uses, is preferably 261-2,000, more<br>
preferably 270-1,500.<br>
(II) Process for producing Nonionic Surfactant<br>
It is preferred that said aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide<br>
adduct (A) of the present invention is produced by the process<br>
(II) of this invention.<br>
In the process (II) of the invention, an aliphatic alcohol<br>
alkylene oxide adduct (e) is one obtainable by adding 1-2.5<br>
moles on the average of an alkylene oxide (b2) to an aliphatic<br>
alcohol (a2) in the presence of a catalyst (d) providing an<br>
adduct having a distribution constant c' of 1.0 or less as<br>
determined by the following equation (4') derived from Weibull<br>
distribution law. Through addition-reaction of an alkylene<br>
oxide (b3) containing at least two carbon atoms to this adduct<br>
(e) in the presence of an alkaline catalyst (f) , an aliphatic<br>
alcohol alkylene oxide adduct of narrow molecular weight<br>
distribution is attained.<br>
c' = (V + no'/n00' - 1)/ [Ln(noo'/no') + n0' /n00' - 1]<br>
(4' )<br>
Herein, v' represents the average addition molar number<br>
of the alkylene oxides (b2) and (b3) added per 1 mole of the<br>
aliphatic alcohol (a2), noo' represents the molar number of the<br>
aliphatic alcohol (a2) used in the reaction, and n0' represents<br>
the molar number of the aliphatic alcohol (a2) unreacted.<br>
Aliphatic alcohols (a2) are alcohols containing usually<br>
1-24 (preferably 8-24, particularly 12-18) carbon atoms and may<br>
be natural alcohols or synthetic alcohols (such as Zieqler<br>
alcohols and oxo alcohols). Among these, alcohols containing<br>
8-24 carbon atoms include the same ones as (a1). Aliphatic<br>
alcohols containing 1-7 carbon atoms include, for example,,<br>
saturated aliphatic alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol, butanol, pentyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol and heptyl<br>
alcohol; unsaturated aliphatic alcohols, such as propenyl<br>
alcohol, butenyl alcohol and pentenyl alcohol; and<br>
cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as methylcyclohexyl alcohol.<br>
There may be used one or two or more of these. Among these<br>
aliphatic alcohols, preferred are primary or secondary ones and<br>
more preferred are primary ones . Besides, the alkyl group moiety<br>
may be linear or branched. Particularly preferred are dodecyl<br>
alcohol, tridecyl alcohol, tetradecyl alcohol, hexadecyl<br>
alcohol and octadecyl alcohol.<br>
As alkylene oxides (b2) and (b3), there may be mentioned<br>
alkylene oxides containing at least 2, preferably 2-8,<br>
particularly 2-3 carbon atoms, liistrative examples include EO,<br>
PO, 1,2- or 2,3-butylene oxide, tetrahydrofran, styrene oxide<br>
and the like, and two or more may be used together. When two<br>
or more are used, they may be added block-wise or added<br>
random-wise. Among these, preferred are EO and PO.<br>
As the catalyst (d) , used is one providing a distribution<br>
constant c' of the resulting alkylene oxide adduct of 1.0 or<br>
less. Preferred is one providing c' of 0.7 or less, more<br>
preferably c' of 0.45 or less.<br>
Catalysts providing c' of 1. 0 or less include, for example,<br>
perhalogenoic acids or salts thereof, sulfuric acid or salts<br>
thereof, phosphoric acid or salts thereof and nitric acid or<br>
salts thereof. Metals in the case of forming salts are not<br>
particularly restricted, but preferably metals other than<br>
alkali metals and preferred are divalent or trivalent metals..<br>
Preferable of these metals are Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Co, Ni, Cu<br>
and Al; more preferred are Mg, Zn, Ca, Sr, Ba and A1, particularly<br>
Mg, Zn and A1. Halogens of perhalogenoic acids or salts thereof<br>
include chlorine, bromine and iodine, and preferred is chlorine .<br>
Thus, preferred as (d) are divalent or trivalent metal<br>
perchlorates, and more preferred are perchlorates of metal<br>
selected from the group consisting of Mg, Zn and A1. Besides,<br>
divalent or trivalent metal alcoholate may be used in<br>
combination. The amount of the metal alcoholate used together<br>
is 20-200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of (d). As<br>
alkyl groups of metal alcoholates, there may be mentioned lower<br>
alkyl groups (containing 1-4 carbon atoms) easy to be distilled<br>
off as alcohols, or alkyl groups of the same composition as the<br>
raw material aliphatic alcohols. Though one kind of these<br>
catalysts may be used alone, it is preferred to use two or more<br>
catalysts in conjunction [for example, magnesium<br>
perchlorate/magnesium sulfate heptahydrate=95/5 - 50/50,<br>
magnesium perchlorate/aluminum perchlorate=99/l - 30/70 (all<br>
weight ratio)] .<br>
From the reaction rate and economical point of view,<br>
preferable amount of catalyst (d) is 0.001-1 part by weight per<br>
100 parts by weight of the total of (a2) and (b2) . More preferably<br>
it is 0.003-0.8 part by weight, particularly 0.005-0.5 part by<br>
weight.<br>
Catalyst used in adding an alkylene oxide (b3) to an<br>
alkylene oxide adduct (e) obtained by adding (b2) to (a2) is<br>
an alkaline catalyst (f). Alkaline catalysts (f) include<br>
hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, for<br>
example, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium<br>
hydroxide and barium hydroxide; among which more preferred are<br>
potassium hydroxide and cesium hydroxide.<br>
From the reaction rate and economical point of view,<br>
preferable amount of catalyst (f) is 0.0001-1 part by weight<br>
per 100 parts by weight of the total of (e) and (b3). More<br>
preferably it is 0.001-0.8 part by weight.<br>
As to reaction conditions in the case of reacting (a2) with<br>
(b2), there may be mentioned methods comprising mixing (a2) with<br>
(d), carrying out nitrogen substitution, thereafter<br>
introducing (b2) at a temperature of 80-200°C under pressure<br>
of -0.8 - 5kgf/cm2 to a prescribed amount of (b2) , followed by<br>
carrying out aging at a temperature of 80-200°C until the<br>
pressure within the reaction system reaches equilibrium.<br>
To an alkylene oxide adduct (e) thus obtained, is added<br>
an alkaline catalyst (f), followed by reacting an alkylene oxide<br>
(b3) in the same manner as above to obtain an aimed aliphatic<br>
alcohol alkylene oxide adduct.<br>
After termination of polymerization according to this<br>
invention, the resulting aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide<br>
adduct may be used as such or through adjusting pH for various<br>
applications. If desired, the catalyst can be removed from the<br>
polymerized product, through adsorption treatment with an<br>
adsorbent, such as "Kyowaad 600" (an adsorbent of aluminum<br>
silicate type, produced by Kyowa Chemical Ind.), followed by<br>
filtration operation. In this case, the time required for<br>
filtration operation can optionally reduced by using a filter<br>
aid of diatomaceous earth type (such as "Radiolite", produced<br>
by Showa Chemical Ind.). Besides, the alkaline catalyst may be<br>
neutralized with a hydroxycarboxylic acid (such as lactic acid)<br>
as written in JP Patent Lay-open No.112931/1981 and JP Patent<br>
Publication No.53417/1990.<br>
Since aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts obtained<br>
by the process (II) of the invention are of lower content of<br>
unreacted aliphatic alcohol, they can be used for the purpose<br>
of improving odor as intermediates for anionic surfactants of<br>
low odor, such as sulfated products and carboxymethylated<br>
products . They are of course useful in the above-mentioned uses,<br>
such as emulsifiers and dispersants.<br>
(Ill) Anionic surfactant<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, provided is<br>

oxide (b1) to an aliphatic alcohol (a1) and satisfying the<br>
following (ii'), (iii') and (iv).<br>
(ii') The ratio Mw/Mn of a weight-average molecular weight (Mw)<br>
to a number-average molecular weight (Mn) satisfies the<br>
following relation (2') or (3').<br>

Herein, v" represents the average of (m'+n'+p') in the<br>
following general formula (1').<br>

equation (4"), is 1.0 or less.<br>
c"=(v" + no/noo - 1)/[Ln(noo/no) + no/noo - 1] (4")<br>
Herein, v" is the Game in the above. This is required only<br>
in the case of v" up to 12, as described above . The n00 represents<br>
the molar number of the aliphatic alcohol (a1) used in the<br>
reaction, and n0 represents the molar number of the aliphatic<br>
alcohol (a1) unreacted.<br>
(iv) It comprises one compound or a mixture of two or more<br>
thereof, represented by the following general formula (1'):<br>
R1O-[(C2H4O)m'/ (AO)n']-(C2H4O)p'-H (1')<br>
Herein, R1 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing<br>
8-24 carbon atoms or a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon group<br>

thereof being in the range of 1-20, and average of<br>
(m/ +p')/(m' +n' +p' ) is at least 0.5. In case of m'?0 and n'<br>
?0, [ (C2H4O)m'/ (AO)n'] represents block addition or random<br>
addition.<br>
The general formula (1) and the general formula (1') are<br>
different with respect to the values of m, n and p and m' , n'<br>
and p', though R1 and A are the same. That is, m' in the general<br>
formula (1' ) is 0 or an integer of 1 or more,, the average thereof<br>
being in the range of 0-5; while m in the general formula (1)<br>
is 0 or an integer of 1 or more, the average thereof being in<br>
the range of 0-4. In the general formula (1'), n' is 0 or an<br>

As aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adducts (A')<br>
satisfying (ii'), (iii') and (iv), there may be used alkylene<br>
oxide adducts after termination of the first step before using<br>
an alkaline catalyst or alkylene oxide adducts after<br>
termination of the second step, in the above-described<br>
production method of aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct<br>
comprising two steps, as far as they are ones satisfying iii' ),<br>
(iii') and (iv).<br>
Methods for anionizing an aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide<br>
adduct (A') satisfying (ii'), (iii') and. (iv) are not<br>
particularly restricted, as far as the terminal hydroxyl group<br>
is anionized, and include, for example, sulfation, phosphation,<br>
sulfosuccination and carboxyetherification.<br>
As sulfation, there can be mentioned a method by sulfating<br>
the resulting aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct (A') as<br>
such and then neutralizing with an alkali such as sodium<br>
hydroxide. Concretely, there may be mentioned, for instance,<br>
(a) method by using chlorosulfonic acid, (b) method by using<br>
sulfan, (c) method by using sulfamic acid and (d) method by using<br>
sulfuric acid. Sulfan of (b) is used diluted with dry nitrogen<br>
or the like.<br>
Reaction temperature is usually 0-70°C, preferably 10-<br>
50°C in the cases of (a) and (b) . It is usually 50-150°C,<br>
preferably 60-130°C in the cases of (c) and (d) . Reaction time,<br>
which may vary depending on reaction temperature, is generally<br>
0.1-10 hours, preferably 0.5-5 hours. Molar ratio of (A') to<br>
the above sulfating agent is usually 1.0:1.2 - 1.0:0.8,<br>
preferably 1.0:1.1 - 1.0:0.9.<br>
Reaction manners, in any cases of (a) - (d) , include both<br>
continuous reaction and batch-wise reaction.<br>
End point of sulfating reaction is such a point that the<br>
acid value (AV) represented by 56100/(molecular weight of<br>
sulfated product) reaches 90-110%, preferably 95-105%, of the<br>
theoretical value.<br>
Besides, the end point, which may be confirmed through<br>
measuring the amount of combined sulfuric acid, is such a point<br>
that the amount of combined sulfuric acid represented by (80<br>
X 100)/(molecular weight of sulfated product) reaches 90-110 %,<br>
preferably 95-105%, of the theoretical value.<br>
Phosphation can be carried out by phosphating the<br>
resulting aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct (A' ) with an<br>
phosphating agent, such as phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid,<br>
phosphoric anhydride, phosphorus oxychloride or the like, and<br>
then neutralizing with NaOH, KOH, an amine or the like.<br>
Phosphation is same as phosphoric esterification, and forms<br>
monoester, diester and the like, all these are included within<br>
the invention.<br>
Reaction of (A' ) with phosphoric anhydride is carried out<br>
at a reaction temperature of usually 30-150°C, preferably<br>
60-130°C within an atmosphere of nitrogen to obtain<br>
diphosphoric ester of (A') , followed by hydrolyzing with water<br>
equimolar of phosphoric anhydride to thereby obtain<br>
monophosphoric ester of (A'). Reaction time, which may vary<br>
depending on reaction temperature, is generally 1-10 hours,<br>
preferably 2-5 hours. Molar ratio of (A') to the phosphoric<br>
anhydride is usually 2.0:1.15 - 2.0:0.85, preferably 2.0:1.05-<br>
2.0:0.95 in the case of monophosphoric ester and usually 1.0:0.4<br>
- 1.0:0.6, preferably 1.0:0.45 - 1.0:0.55 in the case of<br>
diphosphoric ester.<br>
End point of phosphating reaction is such a point that the<br>
acid value (AV) represented by 56100/(molecular weight of<br>
esterified product) reaches 90-110%, preferably 95-105%, of<br>
the theoretical value. Thereafter, the product is neutralized<br>
with an aqueous solution of an alkali such as NaOH or an amine<br>
to obtain an objective composition. Degree of neutralization<br>
may be optionally selected.<br>
Sulfosuccination is a method by two step reaction<br>
processes, comprising the step of reacting (A') with maleic<br>
anhydride (hereinafter referred to as MA) to obtain a monoester<br>
and the step of sulfonating it in the presence of water with<br>
a sulfite or an acid sulfite.<br>
Reaction of (A') with MA is carried out at a reaction<br>
temperature of usually 50-100°C, preferably 60-90ºC within an<br>
atmosphere of nitrogen to obtain a MA monoester of (A'). In case<br>
where MA is added in an excess amount, MA is removed under reduced<br>
pressure after termination of the monoesterification reaction.<br>
Molar ratio of (A') to MA is usually 1.0:0.9 - 1.0:1.1,<br>
preferably 1.0:0.95 - 1.0:1.05.<br>
End point of monoesterif ication is such a point that an<br>
acid number represented by 56100/(molecular weight of the<br>
esterified product) reaches 90-110 % of the theoretical value,<br>
preferably 95-105%.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting monoesterified product is<br>
sulfonated with a sulfite or an acid sulfite. Sulfites include,<br>
for example, alkali metal salts, such as sodium sulfite and<br>
potassium sulfite, alkaline earth metal salts, such as<br>
magnesium sulfite, and ammonium salts, such as ammonium sulfite .<br>
Acid sulfites include hydrogen sulfites, such as sodium<br>
hydrogen sulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, ammonium<br>
hydrogen sulfite and magnesium hydrogen sulfite. Sulfonation<br>
can be carried out by reacting the esterified product with a<br>
sulfite or an acid sulfite in the presence of water. Molar ratio<br>
of the monoesterified product to a sulfite or an acid sulfite<br>
is usually 1.0:0.9 - 1,0:1.1, preferably 1.0:0.95 - 1.0:1.05.<br>
Reaction temperature is usually 30-90°C, preferably 40-80°C.The<br>
reaction is usually carried out within an atmosphere of nitrogen .<br>
Reaction period, which may vary depending upon the reaction<br>
temperature, is generally 1-10 hours, preferably 2-5 hours.<br>
End point of sulfonation is such a point that a combined<br>
surfuric acid amount represented by (80 X 100) / molecular weight<br>
of the sulfonated product reaches 90-110%. preferablv 95-105 %<br>
of the theoretical value. After sulfonation is terminated, pH<br>
is adjusted to neutralize with an organic acid such as citric<br>
acid or an alkanolamine such as triethanolamine.<br>
Carboxyetherification can be carried out, for instance, through<br>
condensation reaction of the resulting aliphatic alcohol<br>
alkylene oxide adduct (A' ) with a mono-halo-substituted lower<br>
carboxylic acid salt, such as a monochloroacetate, a<br>
monobromoacetate, a monochloropropionate, a<br>
monobromopropionate or the like (preferably a<br>
monochloroacetate, particularly sodium monochloroacetate), in<br>
the presence of a caustic alkali and optionally a solvent.<br>
Reaction of (A') with sodium monochloroacetate can be<br>
carried out, for example, in a molar ratio of (A' ) to sodium<br>
monochloroacetate of usually 1.0:0.90 - 1.0:1.60 preferably<br>
0:0.95 - 1.0:1.50, at a reaction temperature of usually 30-<br>
100°C preferably 40-70°C, within an atmosphere of nitrogen,<br>
using a solvent such as toluene and adding sodium hydroxide<br>
gradually. Then, purification processes such as water washing<br>
and separation are gone through to obtain a carboxyetherified<br>
product of the aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct.<br>
Thereafter, water is added thereto to obtain an aqueous solution<br>
of the carboxyetherified product of the aliphatic alcohol<br>
alkylene oxide adduct.<br>
Degree of etherification in carboxyetherification can be<br>
measured with liquid chromatography under the following<br>
conditions.<br>
Measurement conditions of liquid chromatography<br>
Colmun : ODS type, 6 mmØX15 cm<br>
Colmun temperature : 35°C<br>
Elutant : methanol/water=90/10<br>
Flow rate : 0.8 ml/min.<br>
Sample concentration: 10 %<br>
Pour : 30 µl<br>
End point is such a point that a degree of etherif ication<br>
reaches at least 90 %, preferably at least 95 %.<br>
Kinds of anionization as described above may be variously<br>
selected, and there can be used different types depending upon<br>
uses of the resulting anionic surfactants. Among anionized<br>
products, preferred are the above-mentioned four types.<br>
Concrete examples of preferable anionic surfactants<br>
include anionized products of (A') of the general formula (1),<br>
wherein R1 is an aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing 8-18<br>
carbon atoms, m' is 0-2 on the average, n' is 0-2 on the average,<br>
p' is 1-3 on the average, and m'+n'+p' is 1-6 on the average;<br>
and particularly preferred are anionized products of (A'), R<br>
being an aliphatic hydrocarbon group containing 8-14 carbon<br>
atoms and m'+n'+p' being 1-5 on the average.<br>
Anionic surfactants, obtain by anionizing (A') satisfying<br>
(ii'), (iii') and (iv) according to the above methods, exhibit<br>
excellent forming properties and detergency. Besides, since<br>
aliphatic alcohol alkylene oxide adduct (A') satisfying (ii'),<br>
(iii') and (iv) contains the raw material aliphatic alcohols<br>
only in a small amount, there can be attained ones of less skin<br>
irritation to human bodies owing to lower content of anionized<br>
products of aliphatic alcohols. In addition, odor is also<br>
bettered. Moreover, phosphated products, sulfo-succinated<br>
products and carboxyetherified products heretofore have had<br>
problems in long-term storage stablity at lower temperature and<br>
higher temperature (particularly misting or solidification at<br>
lower temperature), while products according to the present<br>
invention have remarkably improved stability. Besides, anionic<br>
surfactants of this invention, having surface activities, such<br>
as penetrating properties in addition to detergency and forming<br>
properties as above, are particularly useful as detergents, for<br>
example, shampoo, detergent for dishes, detergent for rigid<br>
surfaces such as metals.<br>
In applying anionic surfactants thus obtained for<br>
detergents and other uses, there may be formulated othez<br>
nonionic surfactants, anionic surfactants, cationic<br>
surfactants and amphoteric surfactants. To be concrete, there<br>
can be mentioned those described above with respect to nonionic<br>
surfactants.<br>
(IV) Detergent compositions<br>
In addition to using the anionic surfactant of the<br>
invention alone, it may be made into a detergent composition,<br>
preferably by blending a nonionic surfactant and/or an<br>
amphoteric surfactant. Illustrative of nonionic surfactants<br>
and amphoteric surfactants are those mentioned above regarding<br>
nonionic surfactants. Amounts of surfactant active ingredients<br>
formulated within compositions are, as solid content, 3-60%<br>
preferably 5-50% of the anionic surfactant of the invention,<br>
preferably 3-60% particularly 5-50% of a nonionic surfactant<br>
and preferably 1-50% particularly 2-30% of an amphoteric<br>
surfactant.<br>
Besides, additives known heretofore can be formulated in<br>
the detergent compositions. There may be used together as such<br>
additives, humectants, such as glycerol and sodium<br>
pyrrolidone-carboxylate; high molecular weight compounds used<br>
as conditioners, such as cationized cellulose, cationized guar<br>
gum, polyethyleneglycol, sodium polyacrylate, hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose and protein derivatives respectively having a<br>
weight-average molecular weight of 500-5,000,000; silicones,<br>
such as dimethylpolysiloxane, modified silicones having<br>
various organic groups introduced into a part of methyl groups<br>
of dimethylpolysiloxane and cyclic dimethylsiloxane;<br>
chelating agents, such as sodium ethylenediamine-tetraacetate<br>
and sodium 1-hydroxyethane-l, 1-diphosphonate; lower alcohols,<br>
such as ethanol, propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol;<br>
perfumes, colorants, preservatives, ultraviolet absorbers and<br>
water.<br>
Forms of detergent compositions, including usually<br>
liquids, pastes, solids, powders and the like, are not<br>
particularly restricted, but liquids and pastes are preferred<br>
in view of handiness. In case of liquid and paste shampoos, for<br>
example, are used the anionic surfactant of the invention in<br>
an amount of 5-30% by weight, the total of surfactants in the<br>
range of 5-50% by weight, preferably 10-30% by weight, high<br>
molecular weight compounds and silicones in an amount of 0-<br>
5% by weight, humectants, chelating agents and lower alcohols<br>
in an amount of 0-10% by weight and water in an amount of 35-95%<br>
by weight.<br>

pressure of 1-3 kgf/cm2 at 150°C . The reaction product was<br>
post-treated in the same manner as in Example 1 to obtain a<br>

Detergency test is carried out in accordance with Leenerts<br>
method (JIS K3370) . Six sheets of slide glasses were used as<br>
a pair of substrates for soils, and soil components of the<br>
above-described composition were used. Using 0.15 %<br>
concentration aqueous solution of the above detergent liquor<br>
as wash liquid, the slide glass coated with the artificial soils<br>
was washed; and a detergency is determined according to the<br>
above equation, and a detergency index is represented as an<br>
index making detergency of nonylphenol EO 9.5 moles adduct<br>
(VIII) as 100. The measurement results are shown in Table 5.<br>

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
Nonionic surfactants according to the present invention<br>
have surface-activities, such as emulsifibility, solubilizing<br>
power, detergency and penetrating power. Therefore, they are<br>
useful in various surfactant applications, for example,<br>
emulsifiers, such as emulsifiers for metal working, emulsifiers<br>
for agrochemical emulsions, emulsifiers for cosmetics,<br>
emulsifiers for aqueous coatings and emulsifiers for emulsion<br>
polymerization; dispersants of agents for paper, such as<br>
pigments and salts of fatty acids; solubilizers of perfumes and<br>
the like; detergents, as household detergents, such as<br>
detergents for clothes and dish-washing detergents, and as<br>
industrial detergents, such as detergents for machinery metals;<br>
penetrating agents; wetting agents; and defoamers.<br>
Since it has been pointed out that alkylphenol-based<br>
nonionic surfactants having been commonly used heretofore in<br>
these applications have a fear of environmental hormone<br>
(environmental endocrine disrupters ); nonionic surfactants<br>
according to this invention, which are non-alkylphenol-based<br>
nonionic surfactants of excellent performances, are useful as<br>
substitute for them in various applications.<br>
Besides, anionic surfactants of this invention exhibit<br>
excellent surface-activities, such as detergency, forming<br>
properties and penetrating power. Therefore, they are useful,<br>
in addition to the above uses of nonionic surfactants, as<br>
shampoos, dish-washing detergents and detergents for hard<br>
surfaces such as metals. They are particularly useful as<br>
detergents, such as shampoos and detergents for cosmetics,<br>
since low temperature stability, odor and irritation are<br>
improved through anionization because of lower content of<br>
unreacted aliphatic alcohols in aliphatic alcohol alkylene<br>
oxide adducts before anionization.<br>
