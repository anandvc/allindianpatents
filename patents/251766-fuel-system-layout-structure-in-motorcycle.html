[0004]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Meanwhile, in a structure in which a fuel tank is mounted to an upper wall of a fuel tank, a connection portion between the fuel pump and a fuel hose is disposed on the upper wall of the fuel tank, and it is necessary to avoid interference of a riding seat with the connection portion.  In the above-mentioned conventional structure, the height of the riding seat is set at such a position as not cause interference with the connection portion, with the result that the degree of freedom in setting the height of the riding seat is narrowed.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in consideration of the foregoing. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a fuel system layout structure in a motorcycle with which it is possible to prevent a riding seat from interfering with a connection portion for connection to a fuel pump, while increasing the degree of freedom in setting the height of<br><br>
the riding seat.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, the invention as set forth in claim 1 is characterized in that, in a motorcycle including a fuel tank mounted on a vehicle body frame, and a fuel pump mounted to an  upper wall of the fuel tank, the fuel pump being contained in the fuel tank, and the upper side of the fuel tank being covered with a riding seat, the fuel pump is mounted to a pump mount portion provided in the upper wall of the fuel tank in the state of being recessed downwards, and the pump mount portion is covered with a cover from the upper side.<br>
[0007]<br>
According to such a constitution of the invention of claim 1, the pump mount portion to which to mount the fuel pump is provided in the upper wall of the fuel tank in the state of being recessed downwards.  Therefore, even though a connection portion for connection to the fuel pump is disposed on the pump mount portion, it is possible to avoid interference thereof with the riding seat, and to increase the degree of freedom in setting the height of the riding seat.  Moreover, since the upper side of the pump mount portion is covered with the cover<br><br>
from the upper side, it is possible to securely prevent erroneous contact with the connection portion at the time when the riding seat is opened for supplying a fuel into the fuel tank or the like purpose, and to protect the connection portion for connection to the fuel pump. Besides, it is possible to prevent the connection portion from being exposed, and to obtain ari excellent appearance.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition, the invention as set forth in claim 2 is charachterized, in addition to the constitution. of  the invention of claim 1, in that the pump mount portion is provided with an insertion hole for inserting the fuel pump into the fuel tank, a lid plate provided at the upper end of the fuel pump is attached to the pump mount portion so as to close the insertion hole from the upper side, and the cover is attached to the lid plate. According to such a constitution, it is possible to eliminate the need for a special member for fixing the cover to the fuel tank side, and thereby to contrive a reduction in the number of component parts.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention as set forth in claim 3 is characterized, in addition to the constitution of the invention as set forth in claim 1 or 2, in that at a<br><br>
position spaced from the fuel pump, the cover is attached to a stay provided on the vehicle body frame in the state of supporting the fuel tank. According to such a constitution, it is possible to eliminate the need for a component part for exclusive use for attaching the cover, thereby to contrive a reduction in the number of component parts, and to firmly support the cover. [0010]<br>
The invention as set forth in claim 4 is characterized, in addition to the constitution of the invention as set forth in any  of claims 1 to 3, in that a luggage box covered with the riding seat is disposed on the front side of the fuel tank disposed on the upper side of a rear wheel, the pump mount portion and the fuel pump are disposed at a front portion on one of the left and right sides of the fuel tank, either a front end portion on the other of the left and right sides of the fuel tank or a rear end portion on the other of the left and right sides of the luggage box is provided with a cutout for passing hoses extended from the fuel pump side into a space between a front portion of the fuel tank and a rear portion of the luggage box, and the hoses are disposed in the state of being bent in a roughly U-shaped form opened on one side in the left-right direction on<br>
6<br><br>
the rear side of the luggage box. [0011]<br>
According to such a constitution of the invention of claim 4, it is possible to dispose the fuel pump at a deep position in the fuel tank, and to smoothly lay out the hoses.  Namely, while a central portion in the left-right direction of the fuel tank is made shallow due to the arrangement of the fuel tank on the upper side of the rear wheel, the arrangement of the fuel pump on one of the left and right sides  of the fuel tank makes it possible to dispose the fuel pump at a deep position in the fuel tank.  In addition, the hoses extended from the fuel pump are passed through the cutout provided in either the front end portion on the other of the left and right sides of the fuel tank or the rear end portion on the other of the left and right sides of the luggage box, and are disposed in the state of being bent in the roughly U-shaped form.  Therefore, notwithstanding the presence of the luggage box on the front side of the fuel tank, it is possible to cause the hoses to be moderately bent instead of being sharply bent, and to smoothly lay out the hoses. [0012]<br>
Furthermore, the invention as set forth in claim 5<br><br>
is characterized, in addition to the constitution of the invention as set forth in any of claims 1 to 4, in that seat load receiving positions for making it possible to receive the riding seat are set on the upper wall of the fuel tank at a plurality of locations in the periphery of the pump mount portion.  According to such a constitution, even when the riding seat sinks under the action of a large load, it is possible to receive the load of the riding seat by the upper wall of the fuel tank at the plurality of locations in the periphery of the pump mount portion.  Therefore, it is possible to restrain deformation of the riding seat, and to prevent the load from the riding seat side from acting on the cover.<br>

[0024]<br>
The body 47 has an intake path 50 extending in the front-rear direction of the motorcycle, and the throttle valve 4 6 disposed in an intermediate portion of the intake path 50 is fixed to a valve shaft 51 turnably borne on the body 47 so as to cross the intake path 50. In addition, the throttle drum 48 is disposed on the left side of the body 47 in the state of being directed forwards in the running direction of the motorcycle, and the throttle drum 4 8 is fixed to one end of the valve shaft 51.  Moreover, a return spring 52 for biasing the throttle valve 46 toward the closing side is provided between the throttle drum 48 and the body 47, and the throttle valve 46 is driven to turn to the opening side when the rider on the motorcycle pulls the throttle wire 49 against the spring force of the return spring 52.<br>
[0025]<br>
A housing 55 for housing the control unit 53 is<br>
17<br><br>
attached to a side surface opposite to the throttle drum 48, namely a right side surface, of the body 47.  The housing 55 is comprised of a housing main body 56 attached to the body 47, and a lid plate 57 for hermetically closing an opening portion of the housing main body 56.  The control unit 53 comprises an electronic circuit (not shown) fabricated on a circuit substrate 54 clamped between the housing main body 56 and the lid plate 57. [0026]<br>
A throttle sensor 58 for detecting the opening of the throttle valve 46 is connected to the circuit substrate 54.  The throttle sensor 58 is comprised of a rotor 59 rotatably loosely fitted in the housing main body 56, conductive brushes 60, 60 projected from the rotor 59 toward the side of the circuit substrate 54, and resistors 61 printed on the circuit substrate 54 so as to bring the conductive brushes 60, 60 into sliding contact therewith.  The rotor 59 is chatterlessly fitted to the other end of the valve shaft 51 in such a manner that relative rotation is impossible. The rotor 59 is rotatably borne on a support shaft 62 which is projected on the lid plate 57 and is penetrating through the circuit substrate 54 coaxially with the valve shaft 51.<br><br>
With such a throttle sensor 58, the opening of the throttle valve 46 is detected on the side of the control unit 53 as a voltage between both ends of the resistor 61. [0027]<br>
In addition, the body 47 is provided with a through-hole 63 opened into the intake path 50, on the upstream side relative to the throttle valve 46. A detection cylinder 64, which has a thin bottomed cylindrical shape and which penetrates through the through-hole 63 with its tip end closed portion fronting on the intake path 50, is provided as one body with the housing main body 56. [0028]<br>
An intake gas temperature sensor 67 is comprised of a thermistor 65 in close contact with the inside surface of the tip end closed portion of the detection cylinder 64, and a terminal 66 extending from the thermistor 65 inside the detection cylinder 64 and connected to the circuit substrate 54.  The control unit 53 is so designed as to detect a voltage variation according to a variation in the resistance of the thermistor 65 attendant on a variation in intake gas temperature. Moreover, after the intake gas temperature sensor 67 is contained in the detection cylinder 64, the detection cylinder 64 is<br><br>
filled with a potting agent 68 consisting of a synthetic resin.<br>
[0029]<br>
Thus, the throttle sensor 58 and the intake gas temperature sensor 67 are connected to the circuit substrate 54 of the control unit 53 attached to the throttle body 47, and, therefore, it is possible to make extremely short the wirings for connecting the throttle sensor  58   and the intake gas temperature sensor  61   to   the control unit 53. [0030]<br>
An upper portion of the housing 55 is extended astride an upper portion of the body 47 to the side of the throttle drum 48, and a coupler 69 opened to the same side as the throttle drum 48 is formed as one body with the housing main body 56 of the housing 55. [0031]<br>

The inside of the cleaner<br><br>
case 70 is partitioned into an unclean chamber 74 on the side of the cover 12  and a clean chamber 75 on the side of the case main body 71. [0032]<br>
A connecting tube 76 for leading cleaned air from the air cleaner 33 to the throttle body 32 is fixedly connected to the case main body 71 of the cleaner case 70 so that the upstream end of the connecting tube 76 projects into the clean chamber 75.  An upstream-side connection cylinder 47a {see Fig. 4) provided as one body with the body 47 of the throttle body 32 is fitted to a downstream end portion of the connecting tube 76. Moreover, a fixing band 77 for fixingly maintaining a connection condition of the connecting tube 76 to the throttle body 32 is wound around the downstream end portion of the connecting tube 76. With the fixing band 77 fastened by a screw member 78, the connection condition of the connecting tube 76 to the throttle body 32 is fixedly maintained. [0033]<br>
Referring to Figs. 5 to 8 also, a shield plate 79 for covering from the front side at least the throttle drum 48 of the throttle body 32 disposed on the rear lower side of the air cleaner 33 is provided by integral<br><br>
molding with a lower portion of the case main body 71 in the cleaner case 70 of the air cleaner 33, and the coupler 69 possessed by the housing 55 in the throttle body 32 is also disposed on the side of the throttle drum 48, so that the coupler 69 is also covered with the shield plate 79 from the front side. [0034]<br>
The shield plate 79 is provided with an operating opening portion 80, for example circular in shape, at a position corresponding to the fixing band 77. A lid 81 disposed on the front side of the shield plate 79 for making the operating opening portion 80 openable and closable is attached to the shield plate 79. [0035]<br>
The shield plate 79 is provided with a support hole 82 at a position away from the operating opening portion 80.  A support shaft 83 to be passed through the support hole 82 is integrally projected on the lid 81, which is formed of rubber, so that the diameter on the tip end side thereof can be reduced at the time of passing through the support hole 82.  The support shaft 83 is integrally provided at its tip end with a plurality of engaging pawls 83a.. for springy engagement with the back surface of the shield plate 79 in the periphery of the<br><br>
support hole 82. Namely, the lid 81 is attached to the shield plate 79 so as to be turnabls around the axis of the support hole 82, between a position for closing the operating opening portion 80 as indicated by solid line in Fig. 5 and a position for opening the operating opening portion 80 as indicated by chain line in Fig. 5.<br>

Meanwhile, when the load exerted on the riding seat 3 6 in its closed state is comparatively small, an intermediate portion in the front-rear direction of the riding seat 3 6 would not make contact with the fuel tank 34A.  However, when the load is increased to bend the riding seat 36 downwards, seat load receiving positions for receiving the load on the riding seat 36 are set at a plurality of locations in the periphery of the pump mount portion 199, in this embodiment, three locations on an upper wall of the fuel tank 34A.  In this case, three elastic members 154A, 154B, 154C fixed to the lower<br><br>
surface of the bottom plate 36a of the riding seat 36 can make contact with the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A at the seat load receiving positions.  Incidentally, a structure may be adopted in which the elastic member 154C is omitted so that the elastic members 154A and 154Bmake contact with the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A at a pair of seat load receiving positions.<br>
[0076]<br>
In addition, a fuel injection port (not shown) for supplying the fuel into the fuel tank 34A is provided in a roughly central portion of the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A, and a fuel injection cap 155 for closing the fuel injection port is detachably attached to the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A.<br>
[0077]<br>
Next, functions of this first embodiment will be described.  Since the shield plate 79 for covering at least the throttle drum 4 8 of the throttle body 32 from the front side is provided as one body with the cleaner case 70 of the air cleaner 33, it is possible to prevent water or mud splashed by the front wheel WR from being sprinkled on the throttle drum 48, while obviating an increase in the number of component parts.<br>
[0078]<br><br>
In addition, since the control unit 53 for controlling the operation of the fuel injection valve 91 for supplying the fuel to the engine E is attached to the body 47 of the throttle body 32 and the control unit 53 is also covered with the shield plate 79 from the front side, it is possible to enhance the waterproof and mud-proof performances of the control unit 53.<br>
[0079]<br>
Further, since the throttle drum guard 161 for covering the throttle drum 4 8 of the throttle body 32 from a lateral side (in this embodiment, the left side) is attached to the cleaner case 70 of the air cleaner 33, it is possible to prevent water or mud from being sprinkled onto the throttle drum 48 from a lateral side of the throttle body 32.<br>
[0080]<br>
Moreover, since the shield plate 79 is provided with the operating opening portion 80 at a position corresponding to the fixing band 77 for connecting to the throttle body 32 the connecting tube 76 for leading cleaned air from the air cleaner 33 and the cover plate 81 for making the operating opening portion 80 openable and closable is attached to the shield plate 79, it can be made easy, notwithstanding the presence of the shield<br><br>
plate 79, to insert fingers from the front side through the operating opening portion 80 to hold the fixing band 77 and fasten and unfasten the fixing band 77 from a lateral side of the shield plate 79, and it is possible to enhance workability at the time of maintenance and at the time of assembly. [0081]<br>
In addition, since the pump mount portion 119 for mounting the fuel pump 118 to be contained in the fuel tank 34A is provided at the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A in the state of being recessed downwards and the pump mount portion 119 is covered with the cover 138 from the upper side, it is possible to obviate interference with the riding seat 36 and to increase the degree of freedom in setting the height of the riding seat 36, even where connection portions of the fuel hose 132, the return hose 13 3 and the like in relation to the fuel pump 118 are disposed on or over the pump mount portion 119. Moreover, since the pump mount portion 119 is covered with the. cover 3 6 from the upper side, when the riding seat 3 6 is opened for supplying the fuel into the fuel tank 34A or the like purpose it is possible to securely prevent erroneous contact with the above-mentioned connection portions, to protect the connection portions for<br><br>
connection to the fuel pump 118, to prevent the connection portions from being exposed, and to thereby obtain an  excellent appearance. [0082]<br>
Besides, since the lid plate 126 provided at the upper end of the fuel pump 118 so as to close from above the insertion hole 121 provided in the pump mount portion 119 for inserting the fuel pump 118 into the fuel tank 34A is attached to the pump mount portion 119 and the cover 138 is attached to the lid plate 126 through the support members 139, 139, it is unnecessary to provide a special member for fixing the cover 13 8 to the side of the fuel tank 34A, and it is thereby possible to reduce the number of component parts. [0083]<br>
Since the right front portion of the cover 13 8 spaced from the fuel pump 118 is co-fastened, together with the fuel tank 34A, to the stays 113 provided on the rear frames 23 of the vehicle body frame 20 so as to support the fuel tank 34A, it is unnecessary to provide a component part for exclusive use for mounting the cover 138, and it is possible to contrive a reduction in the number of component parts and to firmly support the cover 138.<br><br>
[0084]<br>
In addition, since the pump mount portion 119 and the fuel pump 118 are disposed at a front portion on one of the left and right sides (in this embodiment, the left side portion 34L) of the fuel tank 34A disposed on the upper side of the rear wheel WR, the fuel pump 118 can be disposed at a deep position in the fuel tank 34A.  Namely, the central portion 34C in the left-right direction of the fuel tank 34A becomes shallow due to the arrangement of" the fuel tank 34A  on the  upper side of the rear wheel WR, and the arrangement of the fuel pump 118 on one of the left and right sides of the fuel tank 34A makes it possible to dispose the fuel pump 118 at a deep position in the fuel tank 34A.<br>
[0085] Besides, the front end portion on the other of the left and right sides (in this embodiment, the right side portion 34R) of the fuel tank 34A is provided with the cutout 135 through which the fuel hose 132 and the return hose 133 extended from the side of the fuel pump 118 are passed between the fuel tank 34A and the rear portion of the luggage box 35A disposed on the front side of the fuel tank 34A, and the fuel hose 132 and the return hose 133 are disposed in the state of being bent in a roughly<br><br>
U-shaped form opened on one of the left and right sides (in this embodiment, the left side) on the rear side of the luggage box 35A.  This ensures that, in spite of the presence of the luggage box 35A on the front side of the fuel tank 34A, the fuel hose 132 and the return hose 133 are bent moderately instead of being bent sharply, and the fuel hose 132 and the return hose 133 can be laid out smoothly.<br>
[0086]<br>
Furthermore, the seat load receiving positions making it possible to bear the riding seat 3 6 on the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A are set at a plurality of locations in the periphery of the pump mount portion 119, and the load on the riding seat 3 6 can be borne on the upper wall of the fuel tank 34A at the plurality of locations in the periphery of the pump mount portion 119 even when the riding seat 3 6 sinks under the action of a large load.
