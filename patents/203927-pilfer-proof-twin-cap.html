The   Patent  Act,   1970 (38  of  1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION.<br>
(Section  10;   Rule  13)<br>
"PILIIR PROOF TWIN CAP".<br>
M/i. STIRIPACK (A Partnership Firm Registered under Indian Partnership Act, 1932)? whose partners are (1) MR, AMIT TAP AS BISWAS (Indian national) &amp; (2) MR, SUJIT TAPAS BISWAS (Indian National) having office at 152/35, Vijay Laxmi Industrial Estate, New Link Road, Andheri (West), MUMBAI - 400 053.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention &amp; the manner in which it is performed;<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a product which is 'Pilfer proof twin cap'.<br>
Presently there are many types of dropper bottles available in India as well as In the international market. These bottles with a dropper plug usually have a cap which merely closes the bottle and not airtight. The plug of these bottles has to be punctured with some pointed object before the first use or there maybe a built-in spike but cannot be fixed tight.<br>
However, the above mentioned conventional designs of caps have many disadvantages, some of which are mentioned below.<br>
The conventional designs available in India as well as in the international market are not mechanically leak-proof or airtight. Hence a considerable amount of the solution stored in the bottle may be lost due to leakage; also the solution will get contaminated with outside atmosphere.<br>
There is no such dropper bottle existing in the market, which can keep continuous pressure on the plug. This means that conventional cap designs run the risk of leaking during production itself. Further, leakages may aiso occur during transit, storage or actual use of the dropper bottles.<br>
At the time of actual use, in the conventional designs / systems, the entire cap has to be removed to discharge the contents. Hence in such designs, if the solution is oily or slippery, the dropper plug may slip out and the entire contents may drop out.<br>
-2-<br><br>
Usually, in conventional designs, the portion of the plug getting into the bottle is increased dimensionaily so that it should stop any seepage / leakage through any space between the plug and bottle, But actually, by Increasing the portion of the plug getting into the bottle dimensionaiiy, tremendous pressure is created on the bottle neck (side ways) but there is not protection from the outside of the bottle to prevent bulging of the bottle neck. As a result, excessive bulging may also result In cracking of the bottle neck.<br>
The dropper plug has to be punctured before the first use. in existing designs, there is no special arrangement available for puncturing the plug, hence using any pointed device results in an uneven hole.<br>
Further, by using any pointed object for puncturing the plug could induce germs and unwanted external pollutants into the solution in the bottle. This can be harmful if the dropper bottle contains medicinal solutions such as eye drops, nasai drops or eardrops.<br>
The present invention "Pilfer proof twin cap" is developed with a goal to overcome the disadvantages of the conventional designs and provide a better alternative.<br>
The first objective of the present invention is that it should be leak-proof so that the solution stored in the bottle Is not lost or contaminated due to leakage.<br>
-3-<br><br>
It should be able to keep continuous pressure on the plug so as to eliminate the risk of leaking during production, transit, storage or actual use of the dropper bottles.<br>
The design of the cap should be such that at the time of actual use, the entire cap should not have to be removed to discharge the contents. The dropper plug should not slip out even if the solution is oily or slippery.<br>
Since, by increasing the portion of the plug getting into the bottle, tremendous pressure is created on the bottle neck, the present design should offer protection from the outside of the bottle to prevent bulging of the bottle neck to prevent cracking of the bottle neck.<br>
Another objective is to provide a special arrangement for puncturing the dropper plug so as to help make an even and uniform hole and avoid infection by way of stray pointed objects.<br>
The present invention "Pilfer proof twin cap" will now be explained in detail with the help of figures 1 to 6 of accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-section of the Dropper plug.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-section of the Pilfer proof twin cap.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-section of the Dropper bottle.<br>
Figure 4 shows the position of the bottle plug and cap after fixing, before breaking.<br>
Figure 5 shows the position after breaking and making hole.<br>
Figure 6 shows the position after top cap is removed to deliver the contents.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates dropper hole (1), thread of plug (2), plug shoulder (3) and portion getting into the neck of the bottle (4).<br>
Figure 2 illustrates top portion of the cap (5), bottom portion of the cap (6), spike to make hole by piercing (7), pilfer arrangement (8) and shoulder of bottom portion of the cap (9).<br>
Figure 3 illustrates flat portion of the bottle mouth (10), thread of the bottle neck (11) and bottle neck (12).<br>
-5-<br><br>
The present invention is manufactured in two parts - top portion and bottom portion of the cap and moulded into a single piece with breaking arrangement. The shoulder of the bottom portion of the cap is designed to make it airtight, creating pressure around the shoulder of the cap on to the shoulder of the plug and thus dropper plug shoulder gets settled flat and airtight on the flat portion of the bottle mouth.<br>
Before the first use, one has to turn the top portion of the cap and break it. The top portion has got two features, an inbuilt pointed spike and an extra thread to get fitted to the thread of the dropper plug. This facilitates the top cap to come down through the thread with an accurate direction, and on the process the pointed spike portion pricks the plug and creates a hole, before the first use. After the hole is made one can open the top cap and discharge the contents. The cap can be reaffixed in an airtight manner.<br>
The present invention "Pilfer proof twin cap" has many advantages, some of which are mentioned in the following paragraphs.<br>
In the present design, one need not open both the portion of the cap and thus facilitates the manufacturer to seal the bottom portion of the cap with the bottle.<br>
-6-<br><br>
The present invention is mechanically leak proof design. Since there is continuous pressure on the plug, all types of leakage chances are addressed and use of dropper bottle has been made easy in every department, that is, production, transit, storage and finally actual use.<br>
In the present invention, at the time of actual use, the bottle and the plug is in locked position with the help of bottom portion of the cap and the contents can come out only from the plughole, that too only after pricking. Hence there is no chance of the dropper plug slipping out even if the solution is oily or slippery.<br>
In the present design, the bottom portion of the cap is tightly fitted on the bottle neck. Since the neck of the bottle is under pressure from both the sides (from inside by tight plug and from outside by tight cap), there is no scope for bulging or cracking.<br>
While breaking the cap before the first use, the top cap comes down through the extra thread with an accurate direction, and in the process the pointed spike pricks the plug. This helps create a hole in an even and uniform manner. After the hole is made one can open the top cap and discharge the contents.<br>
-7-<br><br>
WE CLAIM :-<br>
1)	A pilfer proof twin cap which has a top portion with an inbuilt pointed spike and an extra thread to get fitted to the thread of the dropper plug so that before the first use the top cap is rotated clockwise to come down through the extra thread with an accurate direction and in the process the pointed spike portion pricks the plug and create a hole, and the bottom portion, The top and bottom portion are moulded into a single piece with breaking arrangement, in which the shoulder of the bottom portion of the cap gets settled flat and airtight #n the flat portion of the bottle mouth.<br>
2)	The twin cap as claimed in claim 1 herein is described with the help of figures 1 to 6 of accompanying drawings.<br>
