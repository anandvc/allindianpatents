NON-AQUEOUS PIGMENT DISPERSIONS USING DISPERSION SYNERGISTS<br>
Technical field<br>
[0001]  The present invention relates to stable diketopyrrolo-pyrrole dispersions and Inkjet inks using specific dispersion synergists.<br>
Background art<br>
[0002]   Pigment dispersions are made using a dispersant. A dispersant is a<br>
substance for promoting the formation and stabilization of a dispersion of pigment particles in a dispersion medium. Dispersants are generally surface-active materials having an anionic, cationic or non-ionic structure. The presence of a dispersant substantially reduces the dispersing energy required. Dispersed pigment particles may have a tendency to re-agglomerate after the dispersing operation, due to mutual attraction forces. The use of dispersants also counteracts this re-agglomeration tendency of the pigment particles.<br>
[0003]   The dispersant has to meet particularly high requirements when used for Inkjet inks. Inadequate dispersing manifests itself as increased viscosity in liquid systems, loss of brilliance and/or hue shifts. Moreover, particularly good dispersion of the pigment particles is required to ensure unimpeded passage of the pigment particles through the nozzles of the print head, which are usually only a few micrometers in diameter. In addition, pigment particle agglomeration and the associated blockage of the printer nozzles has to be avoided in the standby periods of the printer.<br>
[0004]   Polymeric dispersants contain in one part of the molecule so-called anchor groups, which adsorb onto the pigments to be dispersed. In a spatially separate part of the molecule, polymeric dispersants have polymer chains compatible with the dispersion medium, thus stabilizing the pigment particles in the dispersion medium. Typical polymeric dispersants include graft copolymer and block copolymer dispersants.<br>
[0005]   In aqueous Inkjet inks, the polymeric dispersants generally contain hydrophobic anchor groups exhibiting a high affinity for the pigment surface and hydrophilic polymer chains for stabilizing the pigments in the aqueous dispersion medium.<br><br>
[0006]  The preparation of good thermally stable dispersions with submicron particles is more difficult for non-aqueous Inkjet inks, such as solvent based, oil based and radiation curable Inkjet inks. The pigments are especially difficult to disperse when they have a non-polar surface.<br>
[0007]  These problems have lead to the design of very specific polymeric dispersants wherein the anchor groups are pigment derivatives. For example, EP 0763378 A (TOYO INK) discloses a pigment composition comprising a non-aqueous type pigment dispersing agent having a portion which has a high affinity with a pigment and which has at least one type selected from the group consisting of an organic dye, anthraquinone and acridone only at a terminal end or at both terminal ends of at least one polymer selected from a linear urethane polymer and a linear acrylic polymer, and a pigment.<br>
f0008]  Another approach for dispersing pigments with non-polar surfaces in non¬aqueous dispersion media is changing the surface to a more polar surface by addition of compounds known as dispersion synergists. A dispersion synergist is a compound that promotes the adsorption of the polymeric dispersant on the surface of the pigment. It is suggested that the synergist should possess the pigment structure substitued by one or more sulphonic acid groups or ammonium salts thereof.<br>
[0009]    US 4461647 (ICI) discloses a dispersion of a pigment in an organic liquid containing a water-insoluble asymmetric disazo compound comprising a central divalent group free from acidic and other ionic substituents linked through azo groups to two monovalent end groups characterized in that one end group, the first, is free from acidic and other ionic substituents and the other end group, the second, carries a single substituted ammonium-acid salt group.<br>
[0010]    US 4057436 (ICl) discloses pigment dispersions in organic liquids using polymeric or resinous dispersing agents in the presence of a substituted ammonium salt of a colored acid wherein there are between 16 and 60 carbon atoms contained in at least 3 chains attached to the N-atom of the substituted ammonium ion.<br><br>
[0011]    us 6641655 (AVECIA) discloses the use of a diquaternary ammonium salt of a coloured acid as fluidising agent wherein the diquaternary ammonium cation contains two or more nitrogen atoms.<br>
[0012]   Although these dispersion synergists work fine for some pigments, many other pigments can not be dispersed to an acceptable quality in a non¬aqueous medium. This is the case for diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments, for which it is difficult to obtain stable non-aqueous pigment dispersions, especially stable non-aqueous ink-jet inks.<br>
[0013]    US 6821334 (DAINICHISEIKA COLOR ) discloses a surface modification<br>
of the diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments C.I. Pigment Red 254 and C.I.<br>
Pigment Red 255. The sulfonated particles are easily dispersible as an	■<br>
aqueous pigment dispersion, but no details are given on their performance in non-aqueous pigment dispersions.<br>
[0014]    US 20040122130(CHANG ET AL.) discloses a photocurable pigment type Inkjet ink composition containing Pigment Red 254 but the ink requires the presence of water and a reactive surfactant.<br>
[0015]    EP 224445 A (CIBA) discloses pigment dispersions of pyrrolo-pyrrole pigments with dispersion synergists comprising sulphonic acid groups, carboxyl groups, phosphate groups and salts thereof on the phenyl ring of the pyrrolo-pyrrole pigment of which it is derived.<br>
[0016]    JP 2004067714 (TORAY INDUSTRIES) discloses pigment dispersions<br>
including dispersion synergists comprising sulphonic acid groups, carboxyl groups and salts thereof on the phenyl ring of the pyrrolo-pyrrole pigment of which it is derived.<br>
[0017]    JP 2003346926 (TOYO INK) discloses a sensitizing dye for photoelectric conversion used in a dye sensitized photoelectric converting cell wherein the sensitising dye is a diketopyrrolopyrrole compound substituted on both nitrogen atoms with a monovalent organic residue.<br>
[0018]   For consistent image quality, Inkjet inks require a dispersion stability<br>
capable of dealing with high temperatures (above 60°C) during transport of the ink to a customer, jetting at elevated temperatures and changes in the dispersion medium of the Inkjet ink during use, for example.<br><br>
evaporation of solvent and increasing concentrations of tiumectants,<br>
penetrants and other additives. [0019]  Therefore, it is highly desirable to manufacture pigmented Inkjet inks using<br>
diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments in a non-aqueous medium exhibiting a high<br>
dispersion quality and stability. Objects of the invention [0020]   It is an object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous<br>
diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment dispersions with high dispersion quality and<br>
stability. [0021]   It is a further object of the present invention to provide non-aqueous<br>
diketopyrrolo-pyrrole Inkjet inks producing images of high image quality<br>
with a high optical density.<br>
[0022]   Further objects of the invention will become apparent from the description<br>

pigment dispersions of high dispersion quality and stability were obtained<br>
by using a quinacridone derivative containing a carboxyl group. [0024]  Objects of the present invention have been realized with a non-aqueous<br>
pigment dispersion comprising a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment, a<br>
polymeric dispersant and a dispersion synergist in a dispersion medium<br>

[0033]  The term "carboxyl group" as used in disclosing the present invention<br>
means the functional group of carboxylic acid, i.e. -COOH. It is also known as carboxy group.<br>
Pigment dispersions<br>
[0034]  The non-aqueous pigmented dispersion according to the present invention contains at least three components: (i) a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment, (ii) a polymeric dispersant and (iii) a dispersion synergist. The components are present in a non-aqueous liquid dispersion medium.<br>
[0035]  The term "non-aqueous liquid" refers to a liquid carrier which should<br>
contain no water. However sometimes a small amount, generally less than 5 wt% of water based on the total weight of the pigmented dispersion, can be present. This water was not intentionally added but came into the formulation via other components as a contamination, such as for example polar organic solvents. Higher amounts of water than 5 wt% tend to make the non-aqueous pigmented dispersions instable, preferably the water<br><br>
content is less than 1 wt% based on the total weight dispersion medium and most preferably no water at all is present.<br>
[0036]  The non-aqueous pigmented dispersion according to the present invention may further also contain at least one surfactant.<br>
[0037]   In a preferred embodiment the non-aqueous pigmented dispersion is a non-aqueous Inkjet ink. The non-aqueous Inkjet ink may contain at least one humectant to prevent the clogging of the nozzle, due to its ability to slow down the evaporation rate of ink.<br>
[0038]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink is preferably an Inkjet ink selected from the group consisting of an organic solvent based, an oil based and a curable Inkjet ink. The curable Inkjet ink is preferably radiation curable.<br>
[0039]  The viscosity of the Inkjet ink is preferably lower than 100 mPa.s at 30°C. The viscosity of the Inkjet ink is preferably lower than 30 mPa.s, more preferably lower than 15 mPa.s, and mst preferably between 2 and 1.0    mPas at a shear rate of 100 s-1and a jetting temperature between 10 and 70°C.<br>
[0040]   The curable Inkjet ink may contain as dispersion medium monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers possessing different degrees of functionality. A mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri- and/or higher functionality monomers, oligomers or prepolymers may be used. A catalyst called an initiator for initiating the polymerization reaction may be included in the curable Inkjet ink. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable pigment dispersion may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0041]  The non-aqueous Inkjet ink is particular suitable as a magenta Inkjet ink in a non-aqueous CMYK Inkjet ink set. The non-aqueous CMYK Inkjet ink set may also be extended with extra inks such as red, green, blue, and/or orange to further enlarge the colour gamut of the image. The CMYK ink set may also be extended by the combination of full density and light<br><br>
density inks of both colour inks and/or black inks to improve the inriage quality by lowered graininess.<br>
Dispersion synergists<br>
[0042]  The non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to the present invention contains at least one quinacridone derivative containing at least one acid group or a salt thereof as a dispersion synergist. A mixture of dispersion synergists may be used to obtain better dispersion stability.<br>
[0043]  The dispersion synergist is preferably a quinacridone derivative substituted on only one of the two nitrogen atoms of the quinacridone basic chromophore structure with at least one acid group or a salt thereof. The pigment C.I. Pigment Violet 19 represents the quinacridone basic chromophore structure.<br>

group, analicyclicacid group  heterocyclic acid group, a hetero-aromatic acid group, an aromatic acid group or salts thereof.<br>
[0045]  The aromatic acid group or a salt thereof is preferably a benzoic acid group or a salt therof.<br>
[0046]  The dispersion synergist may contain two or more acid groups, preferably in meta- or para-position on a phenyl ring. A preferred aromatic acid group or a salt thereof containing two carboxyl groups or salts thereof is a phthalic acid group or a salt thereof. Preferably the phthalic acid group is an isophthalic group.<br>
[0047]  A combination of different types of acid groups may also be<br>
advantageously used. For example, a combination of a carboxyl group and a sulphonic acid, a phosphoric acid or a phenolic group can also be advantageously used.<br>
[0048]  The at least one acid group or a salt thereof may be attached directly to the quinacridone structure or may be attached through a linking group containing 1 or more carbon atoms. The linking group contains preferably 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 12 and most preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment the linking group is a straight chain of 1 or more carbon atoms, wherein some of the carbon atoms may be substituted by a heteroatom such as an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom.<br><br>
a sulphur atom, a phosphorous atom, selenium atom and a tellurium atom. It is also possible that, if present, some of the hydrogen atoms attached to a carbon atom are substituted by a heteroatom such as an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, a sulphur atom, a halogen atom, a phosphorous atom, selenium atom and a tellurium atom. [0049]  The dispersion synergist is preferably a quinacridone derivative according to formula (A) <br>
whereinR1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen; and R3 represents the at least one acid group. [0050]   In a preferred embodiment the dispersion synergist is a quinacridone derivative represented by Formula (I):<br><br>
wherein R1and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen. [0051]   In a more preferred embodiment the quinacridone derivative is represented by Formula (II):<br><br><br>
Formula (II) , wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, methyl, ethyl and halogen. [0052]  The most preferred quinacridone derivative is:<br><br>
[0053]  Another preferred quinacridone derivative is the quinacridone derivative<br>
according to Formula (II) wherein R1 and R2 are both hydrogen. [0054]  Another preferred quinacridone derivative is the quinacridone derivative<br>
according to Formula (II) wherein R1 and R2 are both a methyl group. [0055]  A mixture of the quinacridone derivatives according to Formula (I) and one<br>
or more other dispersion synergists may also be used to obtain better<br>
dispersion quality and stability. [0056]   In case that the dispersion synergist contains a salt of an acid group, the<br>
charge of the anion is compensated by a cation. [0057]  The cation may be an inorganic cation selected from the group consisting<br>
of the la and lla metals in the table of Mendeleev. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the cation is Li+.<br><br>
[0058]  The cation is preferably an organic cation. A preferred cation is an ammonium and a substituted ammonium group. In a preferred embodiment the cation is selected from the substituted ammonium cations disclosed in US 4461647 (ICI) , US 4057436 (ICI) and US 6641655 (AVECIA) incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0059]   Particularly preferred cations include the substituted ammonium groups selected from the group consisting of +N(CH3)2(Ci8H37)2,<br>
-NH(CH3)2(Cl8H37), +N(CH3)2(Cl2H25)2, *NH(CH3)2(Cl2H25), -N(CH3)2(C10H21)2, +NH(CH3)2(C10H21), +N(CH3)2(C8Hl7)2,<br>
+NH(CH3)2(C8Hi7), +NH(C8Hi7)3, ^NH(C10H21)3, *NH(C12H25)3 and +NH(C18H35)3.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0061]   The subsituted ammonium group can also be chemicaliy represented as an amine with the hydrogen attached to the carboxylate anion. This is exemplified for the structures QAD-6, QAD-7, QAD-8, QAD-11, QAD-12 and QAD-15 to QAD-17 of Table 1.<br>
[0062]   The dispersion synergist is preferably added in an amount between 0.1 and 20wt% based upon the weight of the pigment.<br>
[0063]   The synergist should be additional to the amount of polymeric<br>
dispersant(s). The ratio of polymeric dispersant/dispersion synergist depends upon the pigment and should be determined experimentally. Typically the ratio wt% polymeric dispersant/wt% dispersion synergist is selected between 2:1 to 100:1, preferably between 2:1 and 20:1.<br>
Diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments<br>
[0064]   The colour pigment in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion according to the present invention is a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment. Preferably the diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment is represented by Formula (I):<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a halogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, an tert.-butyl group, a phenyl group and a cyano group.<br>
[0065]   Particular preferred diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments are C.I. Pigment<br>
Orange 71, C.I. Pigment Orange 73, C.I. Pigment Orange 81, C.I. Pigment Red 254, C.I. Pigment Red 255, C.I. Pigment Red 264, C.I. Pigment Red 270, C.I. Pigment Red 272 or mixed crystals thereof.<br>
[0066]   Suitable diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigments include mixed crystals of a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment and a quinacridone pigment. The quinacridone pigment may be chosen from those disclosed by HERBST, Willy, at al. Industrial Organic Pigments, Production, Properties, Applications. 3rd edition. Wiley - VCH , 2004. ISBN 3527305769. Suitable examples of mixed crystals of a diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment and a quinacridone pigment are disclosed in EP 0277914 A (CIBA), US 4810304 (CIBA) , EP 0704496 A (CIBA) , EP 0765919 A (CIBA) and EP 0794235 A (CIBA) .<br>
[0067]   Pigment particles in pigmented Inkjet ink should be sufficiently small to permit free flow of the ink through the Inkjet-printing device, especially at the ejecting nozzles. It is also desirable to use small particles for maximum colour strength and to slow down sedimentation.<br><br>
[0068]  The average particle size of the pigment in a pigmented inkjet ink should be between 0.005 and 15 μm. Preferably, the numeric average pigment particle size is between 0.005 and 5 μm, more preferably between 0.005 and 1 Mm, particularly preferably between 0.005 and 0.3 μm and most preferably between 0.040 and 0.150 μm. [0069]   The diketopyrrolo-pyrrole pigment is preferably used in the non-aqueous pigment dispersion in an amount of 0.1 to 20 wt%, preferably 1 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the non-aqueous pigment dispersion. Dispersants<br>
[0070]   Typical polymeric dispersants are copolymers of two monomers but may contain three, four, five or even more monomers. The properties of polymeric dispersants depend on both the nature of the monomers and their distribution in the polymer. Suitable copolymeric dispersants have the following polymer compositions:<br>
statistically polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABBAABAB);<br>
alternating polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into ABABABAB);<br>
gradient (tapered) polymerized monomers (e.g. monomers A and B<br>
polymerized into AAABAABBABBB);<br>
block copolymers (e.g. monomers A and B polymerized into<br>
AAAAABBBBBB) wherein the block length of each of the blocks (2, 3,<br>
4, 5 or even more) is important for the dispersion capability of the<br>
polymeric dispersant;<br>
graft copolymers (graft copolymers consist of a polymeric backbone<br>
with side chains attached to the backbone); and •     mixed forms of these polymers, e.g. blocky gradient copolymers. [0071]   Polymeric dispersants may have different polymer architecture including linear, comb/branched, star, dendritic (including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers). A general review on the architecture of polymers is given by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 1-18.<br><br>
[0072]   Comb/branched polymers have side branches of linked monomer<br>
molecules protruding from various central branch points along the main polymer chain (at least 3 branch points).<br>
[0073]   Star polymers are branched polymers in which three or more either similar or different linear homopolymers or copolymers are linked together to a single core.<br>
[0074]   Dendritic polymers comprise the classes of dendrimers and<br>
hyperbranched polymers. In dendrimers, with well-defined mono-disperse structures, all branch points are used (multi-step synthesis), while hyperbranched polymers have a plurality of branch points and multifunctional branches that lead to further branching with polymer growth (one-step polymerization process).<br>
[0075]   Suitable polymeric dispersants may be prepared via addition or<br>
condensation type polymerizations. Polymerization methods include-those described by ODIAN, George, Principles Of Polymerization, 4th edition, Wiley-lnterscience, 2004, p. 39-606.<br>
[0076]   Addition polymerization methods include free radical polymerization (FRP) and controlled polymerization techniques. Suitable controlled radical polymerization methods include:<br>
RAFT: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer;<br>
•	ATRP: atom transfer radical polymerization<br>
MADIX: reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer process, using a transfer active xanthate;<br>
Catalytic chain transfer (e.g. using cobalt complexes); Nitroxide (e.g. TEMPO) mediated polymerizations; [0077]   Other suitable controlled polymerization methods include: GTP: group transfer polymerization; Living cationic (ring-opening) polymerizations;<br>
•	Anionic co-ordination insertion ring-opening polymerization; and<br>

[0146]   If the non-aqueous pigment dispersion is a curable pigment dispersion, the dispersion medium comprises one or more monomers and/or oligomers to obtain a liquid dispersion medium. Sometimes, it can be advantageous to add a small amount of an organic solvent to improve the dissolution of the dispersant. The content of organic solvent should be lower than 20 wt%  based on the-total weight of the Inkjet ink..In other.cases, it can be      <br>
advantageous to add a small amount of water, for example, to improve the spreading of the Inkjet ink on a hydrophilic surface, but preferably the Inkjet ink contains no water.<br>
[0147]   Preferred organic solvents include alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, aliphatic hydrocarbons, higher fatty acids, carbitols, cellosolves, higher fatty acid esters. Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol and 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 2-butanol, t.-butanol. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons include toluene, and xylene.

[0148]   In the case of a curable Inkjet ink, the dispersion medium preferably consists of monomers and/or oligomers.<br>
Monomers and oligomers<br>
[0149]  Any monomer or oligomer may be used as curable compound for the curable Inkjet ink. A combination of monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may also be used. The monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may possess different degrees of functionality, and a mixture including combinations of mono-, di-, tri-and higher functionality<br><br>
monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers may be used. The viscosity of the inkjet ink can be adjusted by varying the ratio between the monomers and oligomers.<br>
[0150]   Any method of conventional radical polymerization, photo-curing system using photo acid or photo base generator, or photo induction alternating copolymerization may be employed. In general, radical polymerization and cationic polymerization are preferred, and photo induction alternating copolymerization needing no initiator may also be employed. Furthermore, a hybrid system of combinations of these systems is also effective.<br>
[0151]   Cationic polymerization is superior in effectiveness due to lack of inhibition of the polymerization by oxygen, however it is expensive and slow, especially under conditions of high relative humidity. If cationic polymerization is used, it is preferred to use an epoxy compound together with an oxetane compound to increase t+ie rate of f)olymerization. Radical polymerization is the preferred polymerization process.<br>
[0152]  Any polymerizable compound commonly known in the art may be<br>
employed. Particularly preferred for use as a radiation curable compound in the radiation curable inkjet ink are monofunctional and/or polyfunctional acrylate monomers, oligomers or prepolymers, such as isoamyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, octyl acrylate, decyl acrylate, isoamylstyl acrylate, isostearyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl-diglycol acrylate, 2-hydroxybutyl acrylate, 2-acryloyloxyethylhexahydrophthalic acid, butoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxydiethylene glycol acrylate, methoxydiethylene glycol acrylate, methoxypolyethylene glycol acrylate, methoxypropylene glycol acrylate, phenoxyethyl acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl acrylate, vinyl ether acrylate, vinyl ether ethoxy (meth)acrylate, 2-acryloyloxyethylsuccinic acid, 2-acryloyxyethylphthalic acid, 2-acryloxyethyl-2-hydroxyethyl-phthalic acid, lactone modified flexible acrylate, and t-butylcyclohexyl acrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, dipropylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, polypropylene glycol diacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanedioI diacrylate, 1,9-<br><br>

[0173]  A preferred class of monomers and oligomers which can be used in both radiation and cationically curable compositions are vinyl ether acrylates such as.those described in US 6310115 (AGFA), incorporated herein by reference. Particularly preferred compounds are 2- (2-vinyloxyethoxy)ethyl (meth)acrylate, most preferably the compound is 2- (2-vinyloxyethoxy)ethyl acrylate.<br>
Initiators<br>
[0174]  The curable Inkjet ink preferably also contains an initiator. The initiator<br>
typically initiates the polymerization reaction. The initiator can be a thermal initiator, but is preferably a photo-initiator. The photo-initiator requires less energy to activate than the monomers, oligomers and/or prepolymers to form the polymer. The photo-initiator suitable for use in the curable Inkjet inks may be a Norrish type I initiator, a Norrish type II initiator or a photo-acid generator.<br>
[0175]  Thermal initiator(s) suitable for use in the curable Inkjet ink include tert-amyl peroxybenzoate, 4,4-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid), 1,1'-azobis(cyclohexanecarbonitrile), 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), benzoyl peroxide, 2,2-bis( tert-butylperoxy)butane, 1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane,1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butyiperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, 2,5-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl-3-hexyne, bis(1-( tert-butylperoxy)-1-methylethyl)benzene, 1,1-bis( tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, tert-butyl hydroperoxide.<br><br>

[0176]   The photo-initiator or photo-initiator system absorbs light and is<br>
responsible for the production of initiating species, such as free radicals and cations. Free radicals and cations are high-energy species that induce polymerization of monomers, oligomers and polymers and with polyfunctional monomers and oligomers thereby also inducing cross-linking.<br>
[0177]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of photo-initiator together.<br>
[0178]  -A-combination of differnt types of initiator, for example, a photo-initiator and a thermal initiator can also be used.<br>
[0179]  A preferred Norrish type l-initiator is selected from the group consisting of benzoinethers, benzil ketals, a,a-dialkoxyacetophenones, a-hydroxyalkylphenones, a-aminoalkylphenones, acylphosphine oxides, acylphosphine sulphides, a-haloketones, a-halosulfones and a-halophenylglyoxalates.<br>

A preferred co-initiator is selected from the group consisting of an aliphatic amine, an aromatic amine and a thiol. Tertiary amines, heterocyclic thiols and 4-dialkylamino-benzoic acid are particularly preferred as co-initiator.<br>
[0181]  Suitable photo-initiators are disclosed in CRIVELLO, J.V., et al. VOLUME 111: Photoinitiators for Free Radical Cationic . 2nd edition. Edited by BRADLEY, G.. London,UK: John Wiley and Sons Ltd, 1998. p.287-294.<br>

470X avaiiable from SPECTRA GROUP Ltd..  .<br>
[0184]   Suitable cationic photo-initiators include compounds, which form aprotic acids or Bronstead acids upon exposure to ultraviolet and/or visible light sufficient to initiate polymerization. The photo-initiator used may be a single compound, a mixture of two or more active compounds, or a combination of two or more different compounds, i.e. co-initiators. Non-limiting examples of suitable cationic photo-initiators are aryldiazonium salts, diaryliodonium salts, triarylsulphonium salts, triarylselenonium salts and the like.<br>
[0185]  The curable Inkjet ink may contain a photo-initiator system containing one or more photo-initiators and one or more sensitizers that transfer energy to the photo-initiator(s). Suitable sensitizers include photoreducible xanthene, fluorene, benzoxanthene, benzothioxanthene, thiazine, oxazine, coumarin, pyronine, porphyrin, acridine, azo, diazo, cyanine, merocyanine, diarylmethyl, triarylmethyl, anthraquinone, phenylenediamine, benzimidazole, fluorochrome, quinoline, tetrazole, naphthol, benzidine, rhodamine, indigo and/or indanthrene dyes. The amount of the sensitizer is in general from 0.01 to 15 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 5 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br><br>
[0186]   In order to increase the photosensitivity further, the curable Inkjet ink may additionally contain co-initiators. For example, the combination of titanocenes and trichloromethyl-s-triazines, of titanocenes and ketoxime ethers and of acridines and trichloromethyl-s-triazines is known. A further increase in sensitivity can be achieved by adding dibenzalacetone or amino acid derivatives. The amount of co-initiator or co-initiators is in general from 0.01 to 20 wt%, preferably from 0.05 to 10 wt%, based in each case on the total weight of the curable Inkjet ink.<br>
[0187]  A preferred initiator system is 2,2'-bis(o-chlorophenyl)-4,4',5,5'-tetraphenyl-(7CI,8CI) 4,4'-Bi-4H-imidazole corresponding to the chemical formula:<br><br>
in the presence of a co-initiator such as 2-mercapto benzoxazole. [0188]  Another preferred type of initiator is an oxime ester. A suitable example<br><br>
[0189]  A preferred amount of initiator is 0.3 - 50 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable liquid, and more preferably 1-15 wt% of the total weight of the<br>
curable Inkjet ink. [0190]   Irradiation with actinic radiation may be realized in two steps by changing<br>
wavelength or intensity. In such cases it is preferred to use 2 types of<br>
photo-initiator together. Inhibitors<br><br>
[0191]  The radiation curable inkjet ink may contain a polymerization inhibitor. Suitable polymerization inhibitors include phenol type antioxidants, hindered amine light stabilizers, phosphor type antioxidants, hydroquinone monomethyl ether commonly used in (meth)acrylate monomers, and hydroquinone, t-butylcatechol, pyrogallol may also be used.<br>
[0192]   Suitable commercial inhibitors are, for example, Sumilizer™ GA-80,<br>
Sumilizer™ GM and Sumilizer™ GS produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co.

[0193]   Since excessive addition of these polymerization inhibitors will lower the ink sensitivity to curing, it is preferred that the amount capable of     - ~ preventing polymerization is determined prior to blending. The amount of a polymerization inhibitor is preferably lower than 2 wt% of the total ink.<br>
Binders<br>
[0194]   Non-aqueous inkjet ink compositions preferably comprise a binder resin. The binder functions as a viscosity controlling agent and also provides fixability relative to the polymeric resin substrate, e.g. a polyvinyl chloride substrate, also called vinyl substrate. The binder must be selected to have a good solubility in the solvent(s).<br>
[0195]  Suitable examples of binder resins include acrylic resins, modified acrylic resins, styrene acrylic resins, acrylic copolymers, acrylate resins, aldehyde resins, rosins, rosin esters, modified rosins and modified rosin resins, acetyl polymers, acetal resins such as polyvinyl butyral, ketone resins, phenolic resins and modified phenolic resins, maleic resins and modified maleic resins, terpene resins, polyester resins, polyamide resins, polyurethane resins, epoxy resins, vinyl resins, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer resins, cellulose type resins such as nitro cellulose, cellulose acetopropionate and cellulose acetate butyrate, and vinyl toluene-a-methylstylene copolymer resin. These binders may be used alone or in a mixture thereof. The binder is preferably a film-forming thermoplastic resin.<br><br>
[0196] The amount of binder resin in inkjet ink is preferably in the range of 0.1 to 30 wt%, nnore preferably 1 to 20 wt%, most preferably 2 to 10 wt% based on the total weight of the inkjet ink.<br>
Surfactants<br>
[0197]  The inkjet ink may contain at least one surfactant. The surfactant(s) can be anionic, cationic, non-ionic, or zwitter-ionic and are usually added in a total quantity less than 20 wt% based on the total weight of the inkjet ink and particularly in a total less than 10 wt% based on the total weight of the inkjet ink.<br>
[0198]   Suitable surfactants include fluorinated surfactants, fatty acid salts, ester salts of a higher alcohol, alkylbenzene sulphonate salts, sulphosuccinate ester salts and phosphate ester salts of a higher alcohol (for example, sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate), ethylene oxide adducts af a higher alcohol, ethylene oxide adducts of an alkylphenol, ethylene oxide adducts of a polyhydric alcohol fatty acid ester, and acetylene glycol and ethylene oxide adducts thereof (for example, polyoxyethylene nonylphenyl ether, and SURFYNOL™ 104, 104H, 440, 465 and TG available from AIR PRODUCTS &amp; CHEMICALS INC.).<br>
[0199]   For non-aqueous inkjet inks preferred surfactants are selected from fluoro surfactants (such as fluorinated hydrocarbons) and silicone surfactants. The silicones are typically siloxanes and can be alkoxylated, polyether modified, polyether modified hydroxy functional, amine modified, epoxy modified and other modifications or combinations thereof. Preferred siloxanes are polymeric, for example polydimethylsiloxanes.<br>
[0200]   In a curable inkjet ink a fluorinated or silicone compound may be used as a surfactant, preferably a cross-linkable surfactant is used. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects include silicone modified acrylates, silicone modified methacrylates, acrylated siloxanes, polyether modified acrylic modified siloxanes, fluorinated acrylates, and fluorinated methacrylates. Polymerizable monomers having surface-active effects can be mono-, di-, tri- or higher functional (meth)acrylates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Humectants/Penetrants<br><br>
[0201]   Suitable humectants include triacetin, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, glycerol, urea, thiourea, ethylene urea, alkyl urea, alkyl thiourea, dialkyi urea and dialkyi thiourea, diols, including ethanediols, propanediols, propanetriols, butanediols, pentanediols, and hexanediols; glycols, including propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, and mixtures and derivatives thereof. Preferred humectants are triethylene glycol mono butylether, glycerol and 1,2-hexanediol. The humectant is preferably added to the Inkjet ink formulation in an amount of 0.1 to 40 wt% of the formulation, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt% of the formulation, and most preferably approximately 4.0 to 6.0 wt%.<br>
Preparation of a pigmented Inkjet ink<br>
[0202]  The Inkjet ink may be prepared by precipitating or milling the pigment in<br>
	    the dispersion medium in the presence of the dispersant.<br>
[0203]   Mixing apparatuses may include a pressure kneader, an open kneader, a planetary mixer, a dissolver, and a Dalton Universal Mixer. Suitable milling and dispersion apparatuses are a ball mill, a pearl mill, a colloid mill, a high-speed disperser, double rollers, a bead mill, a paint conditioner, and triple rollers. The dispersions may also be prepared using ultrasonic energy.<br>
[0204]   Many different types of materials may be used as milling media, such as glasses, ceramics, metals, and plastics. In a preferred embodiment, the grinding media can comprise particles, preferably substantially spherical in shape, e.g. beads consisting essentially of a polymeric resin or yttrium stabilized zirconium beads.<br>
[0205]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is preferably performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat.<br>
[0206]   In the process of mixing, milling and dispersion, each process is performed with cooling to prevent build up of heat, and for radiation curable Inkjet inks as much as possible under light conditions in which actinic radiation has been substantially excluded.<br><br>
[0207]  The inkjet ink may contain more than one pigment, the inkjet ink may be prepared using separate dispersions for each pigment, or alternatively several pigments may be mixed and co-milled in preparing the dispersion.<br>
[0208]  The dispersion process can be carried out in a continuous, batch or semi-batch mode.<br>
[0209]   The preferred amounts and ratios of the ingredients of the mill grind will vary widely depending upon the specific materials and the intended applications. The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, polymeric dispersant and a liquid carrier. For inkjet inks, the pigment is usually present in the mill grind at 1 to 50 wt%, excluding the milling media. The weight ratio of pigment over polymeric dispersant is 20:1 to 1:2.<br>
[0210]   The milling time can vary widely and depends upon the pigment,           mechanical means and residence conditions selected, the initial and<br>
desired final particle size, etc. In the present invention pigment dispersions with an average particle size of less than 100 nm may be prepared.<br>
[0211]  After milling is completed, the milling media is separated from the milled particulate product (in either a dry or liquid dispersion form) using conventional separation techniques, such as by filtration, sieving through a mesh screen, and the like. Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.<br>
[0212]   In general it is desirable to make the inkjet inks in the form of a<br>
concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the inkjet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. By dilution, the inkjet ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, surface tension, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application.<br>
Spectral Separation Factor<br>
[0213]  The spectral separation factor SSF was found to be an excellent measure to characterize a pigmented inkjet ink, as it takes into account properties related to light-absorption (e.g. wavelength of maximum absorbance Amax,<br><br>
shape of the absorption spectrum and absorbance-value at λmax) as well as properties related to the dispersion quality and stability.<br>
[0214]  A measurement of the absorbance at a higher wavelength gives an<br>
indication on the shape of the absorption spectrum. The dispersion quality can be evaluated based on the phenomenon of light scattering induced by solid particles in solutions. When measured in transmission, light scattering in pigment inks may be detected as an increased absorbance at higher wavelengths than the absorbance peal
[0215]  The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink is calculated by using the data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution or a jetted image on a substrate and comparing the maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a higher reference wavelength λref. The spectral separation factor is calculated as the ratio of the maximum absorbance λmax over the absorbance Aλref at a reference wavelength.<br><br>
[0216]  The SSF is an excellent tool to design Inkjet ink sets with large colour<br>
gamut. Often Inkjet ink sets are now commercialized, wherein the different inks are not sufficiently matched with each other. For example, the combined absorption of all inks does not give a complete absorption over the whole visible spectrum, e.g. "gaps" exist between the absorption spectra of the colorants. Another problem is that one ink might be absorbing in the range of another ink. The resulting colour gamut of these Inkjet ink sets is low or mediocre.<br>

DPP SCARLET EK from Ciba Specialty Chemicals was used. Measurement methods 1. Measurement of SSF [0218]   The spectral separation factor SSF of the ink was calculated by using the<br>
data of the recorded spectrum of an ink solution and comparing the<br>
maximum absorbance to the absorbance at a reference wavelength. The<br>
reference wavelength is dependent on the pigment(s) used:<br><br>
•     if the colour ink lias a maximum absorbance λmax between 400 and 500 nm then the absorbance λref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 600 nm,<br>
If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance λmax between 500 and 600 nm then the absorbance λref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 650 nm,<br>
If the colour ink has a maximum absorbance Amax between 600 and 700 nm then the absorbance λref must be determined at a reference wavelength of 830 nm. [0219]  The absorbance was determined in transmission with a Shimadzu<br>
UV-2101 PC double beam-spectrophotometer. The ink was diluted with<br>
ethyl acetate to have a pigment concentration of 0.002%. A<br>
spectrophotometric measurement of the UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectrum<br>
of the-diluted Ink was performed in transmission-mode with a doubler 	—<br>
beam-spectrophotometer using the settings of Table 2. Quartz cells with a<br>
path length of 10 mm were used and ethyl acetate was chosen as a blank.<br><br>
[0220]   Efficient pigmented Inkjet inks exhibiting a narrow absorption spectrum and a high maximum absorbance have a value for SSF of at least 30.<br>
2.	Dispersion stability<br>
[0221]  The dispersion stability was evaluated by comparing the SSF before and after a heat treatment of one week at 80°C. Pigmented inkjet inks exhibiting good dispersion stability have a SSF after heat treatment still larger than 30 and a loss in SSF of less than 35%.<br>
3.	Average particle size<br>
[0222]  The particle size of pigment particles in pigmented inkjet ink was<br>
determined by photon correlation spectroscopy at a wavelength of 633 nm<br><br>
with a 4mW HeNe laser on a diluted sample of tlie pigmented Inkjet ink. The particle size analyzer used was a Malvern™ nano-S available from Goffin-Meyvis.<br>
[0223]  The sample was prepared by addition of one drop of ink to a cuvet<br>
containing 1.5 mL ethyl acetate and mixed until a homogenous sample was obtained. The measured particle size is the average value of 3 consecutive measurements consisting of 6 runs of 20 seconds. For good ink jet characteristics (jetting characteristics and print quality) the average particle size of the dispersed particles is below 200 nm, preferably about 100 nm. The pigmented Inkjet ink is considered to be a stable pigment dispersion if the particle size remained below 200 nm after a heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C.<br>

[0224] -This exampleJIIustrates the synthesis of quinacridone derivatives -comprising at least one acid group.<br>
Synthesis of quinacridone derivative QAD-1<br>
[0225]  The quinacridone derivative QAD-1 is represented by the formula:<br><br>
[0226]  Synthesis of the dispersion synergist QAD-1 was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br><br>
31.2 g (0.1 mol) of the pigment PV19 in 500 mL dimethylsulfoxide was dissolved by addition of 22.44 g (0.2 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide. The blue solution was heated to about 70°C and 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of methyl-4-(bromomethyl)benzoate was added. The mixture was cooled to roomtemperature after 2 hours and the compound QA-1 was precipitated, filtered and washed with methanol. The yield was 77%. [0227]<br><br>
Formation of the dispersion synergist QAD-1 was accomplished by hydrolization of QA-1. This reaction took place during a reflux of 46 g (0.1 mol) of compound QA-1 in a mixture of ethanol and 50 mL (0.5 mol) of 29% sodiumhydroxide solution. After 1 hour the mixture was cooled down, the precipitate was filtered and washed with water. The precipitate was mixed in 1000 mL water and the acid form was made by the addition of 50 mL (0.6 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The dispersion synergist QAD-1 was filtered and washed with water and ethanol. The yield was 78%. Synthesis of quinacridone derivative QAD-2<br><br><br>
34.0 g (0.1 mol) of dried pigment PR122 in 500 mL dimetliylsulfoxide was dissolved by the addition of 22.44 g (0.2 mol) potassium tert-butoxide. The blue solution was heated to about 70°C and 27.1 g (0.1 mol) of compound QA-2 was added. The alkylation-step was done after 2 hours and the product was hydrolyzed by the addition of 72.4 g (0.4 mol) sodium methylate and 200 mL of water. After 1 hour the mixture was cooled to about 50°C and the product was precipitated with acetone (about 1000 mL). The precipitate was filtered and washed with acetone. The solid product was dissolved in 1000 mL of water and the acid form was precipitated by the addition of an excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The dispersion synergist QAD-2 was filtered and washed with acetone. The yield was 85%. Synthesis of quinacridone derivative QAD-3<br><br><br>
38.1 g (0.1 mol) of dried pigment PR202 in 130 gram dimethylsulfoxide was dissolved by the addition of 23 g (0.205 mol) potassium tert-butoxide. The blue-green solution was heated to about 110°C for 1 hour. Then the mixture was cooled till 40°C, and 25.5 g (0.105 mol) of compound QA-2 was added. The alkylation-step was done after 4 hours. The product was hydrolyzed by the addition of 400 ml of water and 19.5 gram Potassium hydroxide 86% (0.3 mol) after 4 hours heating at 60°C. Then 75 ml concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.9 mol) was added to the mixture. The dispersion synergist QAD-3 was filtered and washed with water. The yield was 100 %. [0232]   Synthesis of dimethyl-(5-chloromethyl)isophthalate (QA-2) was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br><br>
22.4 g (0.1 mol) of dimethyl-(5-hydroxymethyl)isophthalate (QAOH-2) was dissolved in a mixture of 100 mL of Toluene and 0.2 g dimethylacetamide (catalyst). 15.4 g (0.13 mol) of thionylchloride was added drop wise and the mixture was stirred during 4 hour at 40°C. After this period, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath and 50 mL of methanol was added. This solid product QA-2 was filtered and washed with a small volume of methanol. The yield was 58%. [0233]  Synthesis of dimethyl-(5-hydroxymethyl)isophthalate QAOH-2 was accomplished according to the following synthesis scheme:<br><br>
25.2 g (0.1 mol) of trimethyl 1,3,5 benzenetricarboxylate was dissolved in 85 mL of methyl acetate at 50°C. 40.5 ml (0.08 mol) lithiumborohydride 2.0 M in THF was added drop wise and the mixture was stirred during 3 hour at 50°C. After this period 5.3 gram acetic acid (0.088 mol) and 3 mL water were added. The methyl acetate and THF were evaporated, 50 ml water and 50 ml n-hexane were added. The product QAOH-2 was filtered and washed with a small volume water and n-hexane. The yield was 63%. EXAMPLE 2<br><br>
[0234]  This example illustrates that non-aqueous Inkjet inks of high dispersion quality and stability can be prepared using a quinacridone derivative in combination with a diketopyrrolo pyrrole pigment or a mixed crystal thereof. Preparation and evaluation of a non-aqueous Inkjet ink comprising a DPP pigment [0235]  A milling mixture was prepared with 15 wt% PR254 pigment, 15 wt%<br>
polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 39000 and 1.5 wt% of the quinacridone derivative QAD-3 in DEGDEE as dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 % volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes. The prepared dispersion exhibited a viscosityof 23 mPa.s. The Inkjet ink INV-1 was prepared to obtain a composition as described in Table 3 by adding 65 parts by weight of DEGDEE to 35 parts by weight of the milling mixture under stirring at room temperature.<br><br>
[0236]  The inventive Inkjet ink INV-1 exhibited an SSF of 40 and an average<br>
particle size of 119 nm. Preparation and evaluation of non-aqueous pigment dispersions comprising a DPP/Quinacridone pigment [0237]  Two concentrated pigment dispersions were prepared in the same manner<br>
to obtain a composition as described in Table 4, except that the dispersion<br>
synergist QAD-3 was either present or absent.<br><br><br><br>
[0238]  A milling mixture was prepared with 15 wt% PR255 pigment, 15 wt% polymeric dispersant Solsperse™ 39000 and optionally 1.5 wt% of the quinacridone derivative QAD-3 in DEGDEE as dispersion solvent. The milling mixture was then milled under cooling by a NETZSCH™ LABSTAR1 at a 50 % volume filling with yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.) and a residence time of 45 minutes.<br>
[0239]  The comparative non-aqueous pigment dispersions COMP-1 exhibited a viscosity of 3821 mPa.s, while the inventive non-aqueous pigment dispersions INV-2 exhibited a viscosity of 29 mPa.s.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0240]  This example illustrates that non-aqueous Inkjet inks of high dispersion quality and stability can be prepared using a quinacridone derivative in combination with a diketopyrrolo pyrrole pigment. Other pigments, such as Naphtol AS pigments, could not be dispersed by the quinacridone derivative.<br>
Preparation and evaluation of a non-aqueous Inkjet inks<br>
[0241]  All Inkjet inks were prepared in the same manner to obtain a composition as described in Table 5, except that different pigments and dispersion synergists were used. In the absence of dispersion synergist QAD-3, a pigment concentration of 5.00 wt% instead of 4.50 wt% was used.<br><br>
[0242]  An ink composition was made by mixing the pigment, the polymeric<br>
dispersant Solsperse™ 32000, the dispersion synergist and the organic solvent DEGDEE with a dissolver and subsequently treating this mixture with a roller mill procedure using yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide-beads<br><br>
of 0.4 mm diameter ("high wear resistant zirconia grinding media" from TOSOH Co.). A polyethylene flask of 60 mL was filled to half its volume with grinding beads and 20 mL of the mixture. The flask was closed with a lit and put on the roller mill for three days. The speed was set at 150 rpm. After milling the dispersion was separated from the beads using a filter cloth.<br>
[0243]   Using the above method, the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-2 to COMP-7 and the inventive Inkjet inks INV-3 and INV-4 were prepared according to Table 6.<br>
Evaluation of Inkjet inks<br>
[0244]  The average particle size and the spectral separation factor SSF were<br>
determined to evaluate the dispersion quality and were determined again after a heat treatment of 7 days at 80°C. The results are listed in Table 6.<br><br>
[0245]   Poor dispersion quality and/or stability was observed for the comparative Inkjet inks COMP-2 to COMP-7 in the absence of the dispersion synergist or using Naphtol AS pigments. On the other hand the inventive Inkjet inks INV-3 and INV-4 exhibited excellent dispersion quality and stability.<br><br>
