The apparatus is an open-topped box, 45 cm long, 27 cm wide, and 27 cm high, divided into a small (2/5) and a large (3/5) area by a partition that extended 20 cm above the walls (Costall B., et al., "Exploration of mice in a black and white box: validation as a model of anxiety," Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 1989;32:777-785).<br>
There is a 7.5 x 7.5 cm opening in the center of the partition at floor level. The small compartment is painted black and the large compartment white. The white compartment is illuminated by a 60-W tungsten bulb. The laboratory is illuminated by red light. Each mouse is tested by placing it in the center of the white area and allowing it to explore the novel environment for 5 minutes. The time spent in the illuminated side is measured (Kilfoil T., et al., "Effects of anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs on exploratory activity in a simple model of anxiety in mice," NeuropharmacoL, 1989;28:901-905).<br>
Rat Elevated X-Maze<br>
A standard elevated X-maze (Handley S.L., et al., "Effects of alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists in a maze-exploration model of'fear'-motivated behavior," Naunyn-Schiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., 1984;327:1-5), was automated as previously described (Field, et al., "Automation of the rat elevated X-maze test of anxiety," Br. J. Pharmacol., 1991;102(Suppl.):304P). The animals are placed on the center of the X-maze facing one of the open arms. For determining anxiolytic effects the entries and time spent on the end half sections of the open arms is measured during the 5-minute test period (Costall, et al., "Use of the elevated plus maze to assess anxiolytic potential in the rat," Br. J. Pharmacol., 1989;96(Suppl.):312p).<br>
Marmoset Human Threat Test<br>
The total number of body postures exhibited by the animal towards the threat stimulus (a human standing approximately 0.5 m away from the marmoset cage and staring into the eyes of the marmoset) is recorded during the 2-minute test period. The body postures scored are slit stares, tail postures, scent marking of the cage/perches, piloerection, retreats, and arching of the back. Each animal is<br><br>
exposed to the threat stimulus twice on the test day before and after drug treatment. The difference between the two scores is analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's t-test. All drug treatments are carried out SC at least 2 hours after the first (control) threat. The pretreatment time for each compound is 40 minutes.<br>
Rat Conflict Test<br>
Rats are trained to press levers for food reward in operant chambers. The schedule consists of alternations of four 4-minute unpunished periods on variable interval of 30 seconds signaled by chamber lights on and three 3-minute punished periods on fixed ratio 5 (by footshock concomitant to food delivery) signaled by chamber lights off. The degree of footshock is adjusted for each rat to obtain approximately 80% to 90% suppression of responding in comparison with unpunished responding. Rats receive saline vehicle on training days.<br>
DBA2 Mouse Model of Anticonvulsant Efficacy<br>
Alt procedures were carried out in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under a protocol approved by the Parke-Davis Animal Use Committee. Male DBA/2 mice, 3 to 4 weeks old were obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbour, Maine. Immediately before anticonvulsant testing, mice were placed upon a wire mesh, 4 inches square, suspended from a steel rod. The square was slowly inverted through 180° and mice observed for 30 seconds. Any mouse falling from the wire mesh was scored as ataxic (Coughenour L.L., McLean J.R., Parker R.B., "A new device for the rapid measurement of impaired motor function in mice," Pharm. Biochem. Behav., 1977;6(3):351-3). Mice were placed into an enclosed acrylic plastic chamber (21 cm height, approximately 30 cm diameter) with a high-frequency speaker (4 cm diameter) in the center of the top lid. An audio signal generator (Protek model B-810) was used to produce a continuous sinusoidal tone that was swept linearly in frequency between 8 kHz and 16 kHz once each 10 msec. The average sound pressure level (SPL) during stimulation was approximately 100 dB at the floor of the chamber. Mice were placed within the chamber and allowed to acclimatize for one minute. DBA/2 mice in the vehicle-treated group responded to<br><br>
-26-by small increments until the optimvim effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired.<br>

	structure 28 could be prepared from a compound of structure 27 (where LG is<br>
iodide) by treatment with a suitable secondary halide (chloride or iodide) in the presence of magnesium metal, iodine and copper bromide dimethylsulphide in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and alike. Alternatively the method according to El Marini, Synthesis, 1992:1104 could be used. Hence, a compound of structure 28 could be prepared from a compound of structure 27 (where LG is iodide) by treatment with suitable methyl-substituted secondary halide such as an iodide in the presence of magnesium, iodine and lithium tetrachlorocuprate in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and alike.<br>
A compound of structure 27 incorporates a suitable leaving group, which would undergo nucleophilic substitution with suitable nucleophile. Examples of such leaving groups include halides such as chloride, bromide, or iodide, and sulphonic esters such as mesylate, tosylate, triflate, nosylate, and alike. A compound of structure 27 (where LG = iodide) could be prepared from a<br><br>
compound of structure 26 through treatment with iodine, triphenylphosphine, and imidazole in a solvent such as toluene and alike.<br>
A compound of structure 26 could be prepared from compound of structure 25 by treatment with a metal borohydride, such as sodium borohydride in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or DME and alike.<br>
Compound 25 could be prepared in a similar fashion to the procedures of Zoretic et al, J. Org. Chem., 1980;45:810-814 or Nielsen etal J. Med. Chem., 1990;33:71-77 using an appropriate benzylamine, such as but not limited to benzylamine, 4-methoxybenzylamine or 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine.<br>
As an alternative approach, a compound of structure 26 could be treated with sodium metal and ammonia to give 4-hydroxymethyl-pyrrolidinone which could be iodinated affording 4-iodomethyl-pyrrolidinone. 4-iodomethyl-pyrrolidinone could then be coupled with organometallic reagents according to the above procedures avoiding protection of the lactam nitrogen as below.<br><br><br><br><br>
Analogous to the above methods a lactam of structure 33 (see Nielsen et. al., J. Med. Chem., 1990;33:71-77 for general method of preparation) could be employed thus establishing fixed stereochemistry at C3 of the final amino acids.<br><br>

Method 6<br><br>
Compounds of structure 53 could be prepared from a compound of structure 45 as shown above and by the general procedures described in Hoekstra et. al., Organic Process Research and Development, 1997;1:26-38.<br>
Compounds of structure 45 can be prepared from compounds of structure 44 by treatment with a solution of chromium trioxide in water/sulfuric acid. Alternative methods of cleaving the olefin in 44 could be utilized as detailed in Hudlicky, Oxidations in Organic Chemistry, ACS Monograph 186, ACS 1990:7 <br>
-48-Compounds of structure 44 (where R2 = alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl,<br>
alkyl-cycloalkyl) could be prepared from (S)-citronellyl bromide by carbon-<br>
carbon bond forming reactions known in the art and as described in method 3. The<br>
substitution of the halide in (S)-citronellyl bromide with alkoxy anions could also<br>
be used to provide compounds of structure 44 where R = alkoxy or phenoxy ethers<br>
(and appropriate substitutions thereof as according to Formula 1). Alternatively<br>
(S)-citronellol could be utilized to afford compounds of structure 44 by treatment<br>
of (S)-citronellol with a base such as sodium hydride, and treatment of the<br>
resultant alkoxide with an appropriate alkyl halide to afford ethers. In another<br>

limited to, methanesulfonic acid (S)-3,7-dimethyl-oct-6-enyl ester) could be reduced with an appropriate metal borohydride or with an aluminum hydride species, such as LAH, to provide (R)-2,6-dimethyl-oct-2-ene.<br>
To one skilled in the art it will be appreciated that rational choice of either R- or S-citronellol or R- or S-citronellyl bromide would give rise to the requisite<br>
isomer at C5 of the final amino acid.<br>

Method 7<br><br>
A compound of structure 58 can be prepared from a compound of structure 57 by treatment with borontrifluoride diethyletherate and triethylsilane in a solvent such as CH2C12- Alternatively the method described in Meyers, J. Org. Chem., 1993;58:36-42, could be utilized thus treating a compound of structure 57<br><br>
with sodium cyanoborohydride in a solvent such as THF/methanol with 3% HC1 in methanol.<br>
A compound of structure 57 can be prepared from a compound of structure 56 by treatment with dimethylamine in a solvent such as DMF and alike according to the procedure of Koot, Tetrahedron Lett., 1992;33:7969-7972.<br>
A compound of structure 56 can be prepared from a compound of structure 54 by treatment of a suitable primary halide 55 (iodide, bromide, or chloride) under standard transmetallation conditions with tBuLi and treatment of the resultant organometallic reagent with suitable copper salt, such as but not limited to, copper bromide or copper iodide. The resultant organo-cuprate is added to lactam (see Koot et al, J. Org. Chem., 1992;57:1059-1061 for the preparation of the chiral lactam 54) in a solvent such as THF and alike. The procedure of Koot, Tetrahedron Lett., 1992;33:7969-7972 exemplifies this method.<br>
To one skilled in the art it will be appreciated that rational choice of either R- or 5-primary halides 55 would give rise to the requisite isomer at C5 of the final amino acid.<br>
