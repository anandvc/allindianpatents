Cladding panel<br>
Specification<br>
The invention relates to a cladding panel with two pairs of side edges lying opposite one<br>
another, whereby at least one pair of side edges is provided with coupling means<br>
embodied essentially in the form of a groove and a tongue and extending along the<br>
respective side edge.<br>
Cladding panels of this type are generally known. Reference is made by way of example<br>
to EP 1036 244 Bl.<br>
The generic panels are usually produced by essentially cuboid-shaped raw panels, i.e.,<br>
raw panels the side surfaces of which assigned to the side edges run essentially<br>
orthogonally to the walking surface, being machined, e.g., by milling to form the<br>
coupling means on at least one pair of side edges, namely in the form of a groove in the<br>
area of the one side surface and of a tongue in the area of the other side surface. The<br>
purpose of this chip removal is thereby always to achieve the smoothest surfaces possible<br>
in order to be able to slide two panels that are connected to one another via groove and<br>
tongue relative to one another in the longitudinal direction of the respective side edge<br>
when laying the cladding panels.<br>
One problem that generic cladding panels always have to deal with in practice are the<br>
seasonal variations in the relative humidity. In times of high relative humidity the<br>
cladding panels expand because of swelling, whereas they shrink during the heating<br>
period in winter because of the low relative humidity. This swelling and shrinking causes<br>
the formation of cracks between panels abutting on one another even if, as is customary<br>
with many types of cladding panels currently available on the market, the coupling means<br>
of the cladding panels are embodied with integrated locking means, which extend in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the respective side edge of the cladding panel and try to<br>
counteract a relative movement of the two panels in a direction running in the panel plane<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                          1<br><br>
P31794.S01<br>
WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
and orthogonally to the respective side edge. Further causes for the formation of cracks<br>
to be mentioned are the effects of static and mechanical-dynamic stresses, as exerted on<br>
the floor, e.g., by heavy pieces of furniture or by walking on it. With rectangular<br>
cladding panels this crack formation problem occurs in particular at the short sides of the<br>
panels. Furthermore, the crack formation problem occurs to a particular extent if the<br>
panels, as is customary today, are laid in a freely floating manner on the subfloor, i.e., are<br>
not connected to the subfloor by separate connecting means and are not glued to one<br>
another.<br>
To prevent crack formation, EP 0 843 763 Al, EP 1 024 234 Al and EP 1 026 341 Al<br>
suggested a cladding panel with which, in the connected state of two panels, the lower lip<br>
delimiting the groove of the one panel presses against the tongue of the respective other<br>
panel with a prestressing force. This prestressing force is thereby produced by a<br>
permanent displacement of the lower lip from its rest position, which the lip assumes in<br>
the unconnected state of the two panels. This permanent displacement causes a constant<br>
mechanical stress and a gradual fatigue of the panel material.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a cladding panel of the type<br>
mentioned at the outset, with which the formation of cracks between two panels<br>
connected to one another can be counteracted, without providing a prestressing force of<br>
this type.<br>
This object is attained according to the invention by a cladding panel of the type<br>
mentioned at the outset, with which at least one section of the boundary surface of the<br>
groove or/and at least one section of the boundary surface of the tongue is provided with<br>
a roughening.<br>
In connection with the present invention, "boundary surface" hereby refers to the surface<br>
extending from the side surface of the respective side edge, following the groove with a<br>
face normal facing into the groove or following the tongue with a face normal facing<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                          2<br><br>
P31794.S01<br>
WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
away from the tongue and ending on the other side of the groove or of the tongue once<br>
more at the side surface of the side edge.<br>
Providing the roughening according to the invention means that the friction between the<br>
groove of the one panel and the tongue of the other panel is increased, so that a relative<br>
displacement of the two interconnected panels in the longitudinal direction of the groove<br>
or tongue is made more difficult. The crack formation on the panel side running<br>
orthogonally to this longitudinal direction is thus counteracted as well. This means that if<br>
the cladding panel is a rectangular cladding panel with a short side and a long side, the<br>
crack formation can be counteracted at the short side of the panel in that, at least on the<br>
long side, at least one section of the boundary surface of groove or/and tongue is<br>
provided with a roughening. Naturally, providing a roughening in the area of the groove<br>
or/and the tongue of the short side of the panel also results in a reduction of the tendency<br>
to crack formation on the long side of the panel.<br>
With respect to achieving a highest possible friction it is preferred if the at least one<br>
section of the boundary surface provided with the roughening extends both over<br>
essentially the entire length of the respective side edge and in the circumferential<br>
direction of the boundary surface over essentially the entire circumference of the<br>
boundary surface. However, it can also be desirable, not least for reasons of<br>
manufacturing engineering, for the at least one section of the boundary surface provided<br>
with the roughening to extend merely over a part of the length of the respective side edge<br>
or/and in the circumferential direction merely over a part of the boundary surface.<br>
The friction between the boundary surface of the groove and the corresponding boundary<br>
surface of the tongue can be further increased in that, whenever both at least one section<br>
of the boundary surface of the groove and at least one section of the boundary surface of<br>
the tongue are provided with a roughening, these roughenings are provided at least in part<br>
on sections of the boundary surfaces of groove and tongue complementary to one<br>
another. Two sections of the boundary surfaces of groove or tongue of one and the same<br>
panel are to be considered "complementary" within the meaning of this claim if the<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                          3<br><br>
P31794.S01<br>
WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
groove section provided with a roughening of the one panel and the tongue section<br>
provided with a roughening of the other panel bear against one another in the connected<br>
state of these two panels when two identical panels are connected.<br>
The roughening can be embodied in different ways:<br>
For example, at least one section provided with a roughening can be formed by a<br>
toothing. In order to achieve a highest possible friction between two panels connected to<br>
one another, it is thereby suggested that the tooth sequence direction of the toothing runs<br>
essentially in the longitudinal direction of the respective side edge, whereas the tooth<br>
extension direction runs essentially in the circumferential direction of the groove or the<br>
tongue. "Tooth sequence direction" thereby means the direction in which the teeth of the<br>
toothing follow one another; with a conventional gear wheel thus the circumferential<br>
direction of the gear wheel. By contrast, the "tooth extension direction" thereby means<br>
the direction in which the individual tooth extends; with a conventional gear wheel with<br>
straight teeth thus the axial direction.<br>
The toothing can be formed, e.g., by an essentially chipless machining, for instance by<br>
indenting, serrating or the like. But additionally or alternatively it is also possible to form<br>
the toothing by a chip-forming machining, e.g., by piercing, milling or the like. With<br>
both alternatives for producing the toothing it is, however, advantageous to use a tool the<br>
rotational speed of which is adjusted to the feed rate of the panel such that its<br>
circumferential speed essentially corresponds to the feed rate of the panel.<br>
In a second embodiment variant, which can be used additionally or alternatively to the<br>
formation of the roughened section as a toothing, at least one section provided with a<br>
roughening can be formed by a plurality of wood fibers protruding from the surface of<br>
the respective section of the boundary surface. In order to cause the fibers to stand up,<br>
the surface can be treated with an agent, e.g., with a water-dilutable varnish (such as an<br>
unplasticized aqueous copolymer latex) which releases the fibers at least in part from<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                         4<br><br>
P31794.S01<br>
WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
their material compound, e.g., solid wood, MDF or another wood material, raises and<br>
fixes them.<br>
According to a third embodiment variant, which can again be used additionally or<br>
alternatively to the two embodiment variants explained above, at least one section<br>
provided with a roughening can be formed by a plurality of particles applied to the<br>
surface of the respective section of the boundary surface. These particles can be, e.g.,<br>
particles of micronized polypropylene wax with a size of between approximately 30 mm<br>
and 75 mm. Furthermore, these particles can be joined to the surface of the respective<br>
section of the boundary surface by means of an adhesion promoter, e.g., a water-dilutable<br>
varnish (such as an unplasticized aqueous copolymer latex).<br>
As already indicated above, at least a core of the panel can be formed of a wood material,<br>
e.g., solid wood, a chipboard, an MDF board or the like. But basically it is also possible<br>
to apply the principles according to the invention to other materials, e.g., compact<br>
laminate, plastic or the like.<br>
As already mentioned above as well, the coupling means can be embodied with<br>
integrated locking means extending in the longitudinal direction of the respective side<br>
edge. These locking means can thereby be formed from the core material, e.g., in one<br>
piece. But it is basically also conceivable to embody the locking means or/and the<br>
coupling means in or at a coupling unit connected to the core of the panel. This coupling<br>
unit can be connected to the core of the panel in that, e.g., a suitable material, e.g., plastic,<br>
a wood extrudate or the like is injected into a prepared indentation in the side surface of<br>
the panel and is subsequently machined in a material-removing manner to form the<br>
coupling means or/and the locking means. But as an alternative it is also possible to<br>
insert a prefabricated part with coupling means or/and locking means prefabricated<br>
thereon into the prepared indentation.<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                         5<br><br>

The invention can be used in a particularly advantageous manner if the cladding panel is<br>
a flooring panel, and particularly if the flooring panel is designated to be laid in a floating<br>
manner or/and without the use of adhesive to connect adjacent panels.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below by means of exemplary embodiments on<br>
the basis of the enclosed drawings. They show:<br>

panels of this type;<br>

method of embodying the roughening; and<br>
Figs. 5 and 6   Views similar to Figs. 3 and 4 of a further embodiment of a cladding panel<br>
according to the invention.<br>
In Fig. 1, a panel according to the invention is designated in general as 10. The panel 10<br>
is embodied as a rectangular panel and has two long sides 10a and 10b and two short<br>
sides 10c and l0d arranged respectively in pairs opposite one another. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment shown, the panel 10 is provided with coupling means both on the long sides<br>
10a and 10b and on the short sides 10c and l0d, which coupling means serve to connect<br>
the panel 10 to adjacent panels 10', 10", ... in the longitudinal direction L or in the<br>
transverse direction Q (see Fig. 2).<br>
The coupling means 12 are composed essentially in the form of a groove 12a provided on<br>
the long side 10a and a tongue 12b provided on the long side 10b, which together form<br>
the coupling means of the long side, and a groove 12c provided on the short side 10c and<br>
a tongue 12d provided on the short side l0d, which together form the coupling means of<br>
the short side. These coupling means 12 can be embodied in different variants, some of<br>
which will be explained below in more detail with reference to Figs. 3 through 6. But all<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                         6<br><br>

WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
of these coupling means have the common property that pairs 12a/12b, 12c/12d of<br>
grooves and tongues assigned to one another are embodied such that in the connected<br>
state of two identical panels 10 the pairs interlock in the manner of jigsaw puzzle pieces,<br>
thus without prestressing, i.e., in particular without the lower groove boundary lip being<br>
permanently deflected out of its rest position.<br>
On the one hand, the representation according to Fig. 3 can be interpreted as showing the<br>
groove edge 10a or 10c in the bottom left in a first perspective view, and in the top right<br>
in a second perspective view the tongue edge 10b or l0d of one and the same panel 10.<br>
But since the panels joined to form a covering layer are embodied to be identical, the<br>
representation can, on the other hand, also be interpreted as showing the edges 10b, 10a'<br>
or 10c, l0d" adjoining one another of two panels 10, 10' or 10, 10" embodied to be<br>
identical adjoining one another (see Fig. 2).<br>
The embodiment represented in Fig. 3 is a groove/tongue profile which can be connected<br>
by angling into one another two adjacent panels 10 and 10' or 10". To this end, the left<br>
groove panel 10 in Fig. 3 can lie flat on the floor, whereas the right tongue panel 10' or<br>
10" in Fig. 3 is supplied from the side in a position angled with respect to the horizontal,<br>
until its tongue 12b, 12d engages with the groove 12a, 12c of the panel 10. Subsequently,<br>
the locking means 14 provided at the coupling means 12a, 12c or 12b, 12d of the two<br>
panels 10 and 10' or 10" can be brought into engagement with one another by pivoting<br>
downward the tongue panel 10', 10". In the exemplary embodiment shown, the locking<br>
means 14 are thereby formed on the groove side 12a, 12c of the panels by a recess 14a<br>
embodied in the upper surface of the lower lip 16 delimiting the groove 12a, 12c. On the<br>
tongue side of the panel 10, the locking means 14 are formed by a projection 14b<br>
provided on the underside of the tongue 12b, 12d.<br>
In the connected state of two panels 10, the engagement of the coupling means 12<br>
prevents a relative movement of the two panels 10 in the upward direction H (see Fig. 1),<br>
i.e., in a direction running orthogonally to the panel plane or walking surface E of the<br>
panels 10, whereas the interaction of the locking means 14 prevents a relative movement<br>
{P31794 00l47802.DOC}                                                          7<br><br>
P31794.S01<br>
WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
of the two panels 10 in a direction running in the panel plane E and orthogonally to the<br>
respective side edge 12a through 12d. The panel plane E is thereby spanned by the<br>
longitudinal direction L (direction of the long sides 10a and 10b) and the transverse<br>
direction Q (direction of the short sides 10c and l0d) of the panels 10.<br>
In contrast to the panels of the prior art, the panels 10 according to the invention<br>
additionally have a roughening 18 which at least impedes a relative movement of two<br>
panels 10 connected to one another in the longitudinal direction of the respective side<br>
edge 10a/ 10b, 10c/l0d. To this end, at least one surface section of the surfaces bearing<br>
against one another of the coupling means 12 and the locking means 14 are provided with<br>
a roughening 18 of this type. In the exemplary embodiment represented in Fig. 3, this is<br>
on the one hand the base area 14al of the recess 14a on the groove panel shown on the<br>
left in Fig. 3, and the top area 14bl of the projection 14b of the tongue panel shown on<br>
the right in Fig. 3. Please note that the two surfaces 14al and 14bl mentioned above bear<br>
against one another in the connected state of two adjacent panels, and that their respective<br>
roughenings thus interact with one another, which effectively increases the friction in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the respective side edges 10a/10b, 10c/l0d. Within the meaning<br>
of the present application, the surfaces 14al and 14bl of the panel 10 thus form<br>
"complementary" surfaces.<br>
In the longitudinal direction of the two side edges, the roughenings 18 extend preferably<br>
over the entire length of the edges, whereas they are provided merely on a part of the<br>
boundary surfaces of the groove or the tongue in the circumferential direction U, as<br>
shown in Fig. 3. The latter, however, is mainly due to reasons of production technology.<br>
As indicated diagrammatically in Fig. 3, the roughenings 18 are respectively formed by a<br>
toothing, the teeth 18a of which follow one another in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
respective side edge 10a/10b, 10c/l0d ("tooth sequence direction"), whereby each<br>
individual tooth extends essentially in the circumferential direction U, i.e., orthogonally<br>
to the longitudinal direction of the respective side edge ("tooth extension direction").<br>

As shown diagrammatically in Fig. 4, the toothing 18 can be embodied, e.g., by pressing<br>
the teeth 18a into the base area 14al of the recess 14a or into the top area 14bl of the<br>
projection 14b. To this end, a rotating tool 20 or 22 is brought into engagement with the<br>
surfaces 14al or 14bl, the circumferential surface 20a or 22a of which tool has a counter-<br>
toothing corresponding to the toothing 18 to be embodied. Attention must further be paid<br>
to the fact that the tool 20 or 22 rotates synchronously to the movement of the panel 10,<br>
i.e., such that, with a rotation about the axis 20b or 22b, its circumferential speed<br>
corresponds to the feed rate of the panel 10 in the direction of the respective side edge<br>
10a through l0d.<br>
In addition, Fig. 4 shows another tool 24 which corresponds to the tools 20 and 22 in<br>
terms of structure and function, but is arranged such that it provides a toothing to an<br>
oblique boundary surface 14a2 of the recess 14a. Note must further be taken of the fact<br>
that no analogous toothing tool is provided for the oblique surface 14b2 at the tongue<br>
panel shown on the right in Fig. 4. However, even the one-sided provision of a toothing<br>
can further increase the friction between the two panels.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 show a modified embodiment that corresponds essentially to the<br>
embodiment according to Figs. 3 and 4. In Figs. 5 and 6, analogous parts are thus<br>
provided with the same reference numbers as in Figs. 3 and 4, but increased by the<br>
number 100. Furthermore, Figs. 5 and 6 will be described below only as far as they differ<br>
from the embodiment explained previously, to the description of which explicit reference<br>
is hereby made otherwise.<br>
One the one hand, the panel 110 represented in Figs. 5 and 6 differs from the panel 10<br>
according to Figs. 3 and 4 in that the coupling means 112 embodied at the side edges<br>
110a-ll0d are not embodied such that two adjacent panels can be connected to one<br>
another by angling the tongue panel into the groove panel, but that the panels 110 are<br>
connected by being moved towards one another in an essentially planar manner parallel<br>
to the panel plane E. In this case, the locking means 114 are formed by a projection 114a<br>
at the free end of the lower lip 116 delimiting the groove 112a, 112c and by a recess 114b<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                          9<br><br>

WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
in the area of transition of the tongue 112b, 112d into the panel 110. When the tongue<br>
112b, 112d is inserted into the groove 112a, 112c, the lower lip 116 is thus deflected, i.e.,<br>
bent downward, until the nose 114a can catch in the recess 114b. As a result of this<br>
catching, the lower lip 116 returns again to its rest position shown in Fig. 5, in which it is<br>
free of any mechanical deformation.<br>
Also in the exemplary embodiment shown in Figs. 5 and 6, both the groove 112a, 112c<br>
and the tongue 112b, 112d are provided with a roughening 118, namely on the one hand<br>
at an upper boundary surface 116a of the lower lip 116 and on the other hand at the lower<br>
boundary surface 122 of the tongue 112b, 112d. In the present case, the roughenings 118<br>
are formed by particles 118a, which can be applied by means of a spraying tool 128 or<br>
130 (see Fig. 6) to the surfaces 116a and 126, preferably using an adhesion promoter<br>
which, after having dried, keeps the particles 118a on the surfaces 116a, 126.<br>
It should further be stated that it is basically also conceivable to provide merely one of<br>
the two complementary surfaces 116a, 126 with sprayed-on particles of this type, in order<br>
to achieve a higher friction between the two panels 110. Furthermore, it is conceivable to<br>
apply particles of this type also to the surfaces not visible in Fig. 5 on the lower side of<br>
the upper groove boundary lip 132 and on the upper side of the tongue 112b, 112d.<br>
Another embodiment variant for the roughening provided according to the invention is to<br>
be explained as well below on the basis of the diagrammatical representations according<br>
to Figs. 5 and 6:<br>
Also a solvent can be applied to the surfaces 116a and 126 by means of the spraying tools<br>
128 and 130, which solvent starts to dissolve a wood material, e.g., solid wood, MDF or<br>
the like used to form the panels 110, at least so much that individual wood fibers<br>
disengage at least in part from the material compound and project out of the surface when<br>
the treatment agent has dried. In this case, 118a designates the wood fibers projecting<br>
from the surfaces 116a and 126a in Fig. 5.<br>
{P31794 00147802.DOC}                                                  10<br><br>

WO 2006/050928                                                                         PCT/EP2005/011988<br>
The following has to be added:<br>
The panels 10, 110 can be made of any material, e.g., a wood material such as, e.g., solid-<br>
wood boards, MDF boards, chipboards or the like, but also of compact laminate, plastic<br>
and suitable panel materials of this type.<br>
If the panels are to be used as flooring panels, they can have a core l0e, ll0e, as<br>
indicated in Figs. 4 and 6 respectively with the panel 10, 110 shown in the bottom left,<br>
which core is embodied, e.g., as an MDF board (medium-density fiberboard), whereby a<br>
decorative layer l0f, 110f is glued to this core l0e, 1l0e on its walking surface E, and a<br>
leveling layer l0g, 110g is glued to its underside B resting on the floor, opposite the<br>
walking side E. The decorative layer l0f, 1 l0f can comprise, e.g., one or more plies of<br>
printed paper, which is or are saturated with synthetic resin. In an analogous manner, the<br>
leveling layer l0g, l00g can be formed by a laminate layer comprising several paper<br>
plies of this type.<br>
The groove 112a, 112c or the tongue 112b, 112d do not necessarily have to be formed<br>
directly of the material of the core 110e. Rather, as indicated by a dashed line in Fig. 6, it<br>
is also possible to inject a suitable material, e.g., plastic, a wood extrudate or the like into<br>
a recess 150 prepared in the side surface 110a through 110 d, and let it cure there, and to<br>
embody the groove 112a, 112c or the tongue 112b, 112d subsequently by machining.<br>
