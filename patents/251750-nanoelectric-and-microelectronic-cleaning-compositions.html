NANOELECTRONIC AND MICROELECTRONIC CLEANING COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention relates to methods and cleaning compositions for cleaning nanoelectronic and microelectronic substrates with supercritical fluid compositions, and particularly to such cleaning compositions useful with and having improved compatibility with nanoelectronic and microelectronic substrates characterized by silicon dioxide, sensitive IOW-K or high-K dielectrics and copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallization, as well as substrates of Al or AI(Cu) metallizations and advanced interconnect technologies, and particularly such substrates having high aspect ratio openings, including difficult submicron crevices, grooves, trenches and vias. The invention also relates to the use of such cleaning compositions for stripping photoresists, and cleaning residues from plasma process generated organic, organometallic and inorganic compounds, and cleaning residues from planarization processes such as chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and as additives in planarization slurry/liquids.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Many photoresist strippers and residue removers have been proposed for use in the microelectronics field as downstream or back end of the manufacturing line cleaners. In the manufacturing process a thin film of photoresist is deposited on a wafer substrate, and then circuit design is imaged on the thin film. Following baking, the exposed portion of the positive resist or the unexposed portion of the negative resist is removed with a photoresist developer. The resulting image is then transferred to the underlying material, which is generally a dielectric or metal, by way of reactive plasma etch gases or chemical<br><br>
etchant solutions. The etchant gases or chemical etchant solutions selectively attack the photoresist-unprotected area of the substrate. As a result of the plasma etching process, photoresist, etching gas and etched material by-products are deposited as residues around or on the sidewall of the etched openings on the substrate.<br>
[0003] Additionally, following termination of the etching step, the resist mask must be removed from the protected area of the wafer so that the final finishing operation can take place. This can be accomplished in a plasma ashing step by the use of suitable plasma ashing gases or wet chemical strippers. Finding a suitable cleaning composition for removal of this resist mask material without adversely affecting, e.g., corroding, dissolving or dulling, the metal circuitry has also proven problematic.<br>
[0004] As microelectronic fabrication integration levels have increased and patterned nanoelectronic and microelectonic device dimensions have decreased for the production of current and future generation nanoelectronic and microelectronic semiconductor devices and other items such as flat panel displays, it has become increasingly common in the art to employ copper metallizations, IOW-K (both porous and non-porous) and high-K dielectrics. These materials have presented additional challenges to find acceptable cleaner compositions. Many process technology compositions that have been previously developed for "traditional" or "conventional" semiconductor devices containing Al/Sio2 , AI(Cu)/Sio2, or Al/Mo/Sio2 structures cannot be employed with copper, tungsten, tantalum, nickel, gold, cobalt, palladium, platinum, chromium, ruthenium, rhodium, iridium, hafnium, titanium, molybdenum, tin and other metallized, and IOW-K or high-K dielectric structures. For example, hydroxylamine based stripper or residue remover compositions are successfully used for cleaning devices with Al metallizations, but are practically unsuitable for those with copper and other<br><br>
metallizations. Similarly, many copper metallized/ IOW-K strippers are not suitable for Al metallized devices unless significant adjustments in the compositions are made.<br>
[0005] Removal of these etch and/or ash residues following the plasma etch and/or aching process has proved problematic. Failure to completely remove or neutralize these residues can result in the absorption of moisture and the formation of undesirable materials that can cause corrosion to the metal structures or electrical defects to the integrated circuitry. The circuitry materials are corroded by the undesirable materials and produce discontinuances in the circuitry wiring and undesirable increases in electrical resistance. This problem is also especially evident in removing sidewall deposited photoresist or residues and surface-hardened photoresist hardened due to UV radiation, reactive ion etching or ion implantation processes. There is also a problem of removing photoresist" and other residues when they are present in structures having high aspect ratio openings, including difficult submicron grooves and narrow crevices.<br>
[0006] The current back end cleaners show a wide range of compatibility with certain, sensitive dielectrics and metallizations, ranging from totally unacceptable to marginally satisfactory. Many of the current strippers or residue cleaners are not acceptable for advanced interconnect materials such as porous and LOW-K dielectrics and copper metallizations. Additionally, the typical alkaline cleaning solutions employed are overly aggressive towards porous and IOW-K and high~K dielectrics and/or copper metallizations. Moreover, many of these alkaline cleaning compositions contain organic solvents that show poor product stability, especially at higher pH ranges and at higher process temperatures.<br>
[0007] In an attempt to at least partially address these problems, it has been proposed to employ supercritical fluids to remove such organic and inorganic<br><br>
residues from such substrates. Examples of such proposals are found in the disclosure in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,242,165B1, 6,306,564B1, 6,500,6Q5B1 and 6,653,236B2. In these patents it is proposed to clean substrates with supercritical fluids such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, and inert gases such as nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon, and particularly carbon dioxide. It is proposed to employ supercritical fluids alone or with various simple modifiers, such as oxidizers (U.S. 6,242,265B1), carbon dioxide with chemical solvents (U.S. 6,306,564B1), and carbon dioxide, an amine and a solvent (U.S. 6,500,60561). However, the cleaning efficiencies and capabilities of the supercritical fluids alone or with the simple modifiers have been limited in removing bulk photoresist and difficult-to-remove plasma generated residues.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

[0045] The formulation c) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention may also optionally contain fluoride compounds in the formulation, such as for example, tetramethylammonium fluoride, tetrabutylammonium fluoride, and ammonium fluoride. Other suitable fluorides include, for example fluoroborates, tetrabutylammonium fluoroborates, aluminum hexafluorides, antimony fluoride and the like. The fluoride components will be present in the formulation c) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention an amount of from 0 to 10 wt. %, preferably from about 0.1 to 5 wt % of formulation c).<br>

[0047] Examples of the types of formulation c) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention are set forth in the following Tables 14,15,,and 16 in which the amounts of the components are indicated in parts by weight<br><br><br><br>
In Table 16 there are described variations of Compositions D and F of Table 13 with additional added optional components.<br><br><br>
[0048] The formulation d) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention will comprise one or more of any suitable non-ammonium producing, non-HF producing fluoride salt (non-ammonium, quaternary ammonium fluoride salt) in a suitable solvent Among the suitable non-ammonia producing, non-HF producing fluoride salts there may be mentioned tetraalkylammonium fluorides of the formula (R)4N+ F, where each R is independently a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, preferably alkyl of from 1 to 22, and more preferably 1 to 6, carbon atoms (R1 H), such as tetramethylammonium fluoride and tetrabutylammonium fluoride salts; as well as fluoroborates, tetrabutylammonium fluoroborates, aluminum hexafluorides, antimony fluoride and the like.<br>
[0049] The non-ammonium producing, non-HF producing fluoride salts show significantly improved compatibility with IOW-K dielectrics and copper metallization.

Selection of a copper/iow-K compatible "friendly" solvent is also advantageous.   Any suitable solvent free of<br><br>
strong nucleophiles, such as unhindered primary or secondary amines, is preferably employed.

[0050] Moreover, whereas anhydrous ammonium fluoride is practically insoluble in most organic solvents, in contradistinction, tetraalkylammonium fluoride salts, such as for example tetramethylammmonium fluoride (TMAF), can be blended and completely dissolved in organic solvents, such as for example 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-pyrrolidinone (HEP). Thus, a very simple, completely anhydrous, and effective formulation d) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention for cleaning photoresist and ash residues from substrates having a IOW-K dielectric and copper metallization can be readily prepared. An example of such completely anhydrous formulation d) of component (2) of the cleaning compositions of this invention is 50 parts by weight HEP and 0.8 parts by weight TMAF.<br>
