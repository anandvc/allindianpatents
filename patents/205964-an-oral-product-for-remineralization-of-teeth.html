The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br>
REMINERALIZATION  OF  TEETH<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to oral compositions and methods employing such compositions for the remineralization of dental enamel.<br>
The Related Art<br>
In the mouth, there is a natural equilibrium between hydroxyapatite being dissolved from the enamel of teeth and hydroxyapatite being formed on or in the teeth from substances occurring naturally in the saliva.  This equilibrium is shifting continuously.  Among other factors, it is determined by diet and physical condition.  If the equilibrium is such that hydroxyapatite is dissolved, a cariogenic condition arises which is referred to as demineralization.   If the equilibrium is such that hydroxyapatite is being formed in demineralized enamel, this is referred to as remineralization. By remineralization, pre-existing tooth decay and caries can be reduced or eliminated by natural means.<br>
It has long been known that fluoride-providing compounds, even in low concentrations, promote the remineralization process.  They thereby reduce pre-existing carious conditions in the tooth structure.  Fluoride is<br>
2<br><br>
most effective during the developmental years from childhood to young adulthood.  Improved remedies are necessary, especially beyond the formative years. Attempts have been made to arrest or prevent progression of caries by incorporation, of calcium and phosphate ions through dietary and dentifrice means.  A significant hurdle to this approach has been maintaining the calcium and phosphate ions available in a non-precipitated form  Two phase or separately compartmented calcium and phosphate compositions have been proposed.  GB Patent 1,408,922 (Raff et al.) suggests a two-compartment tube, the first being filled with a toothpaste containing calcium chloride and the second containing disodium hydrogen phosphate.  Upon dispensing, the compositions are mixed thereby causing the precipitation of calcium phosphate onto the teeth.<br>
A similar approach is reported by Tung in U.S. Patent 5,037,639 and U.S. Patent 5,268,167.  The restorative compositions disclosed therein employ amorphous calcium phosphate or solutions which will form amorphous calcium phosphate suspended in a carrier.  Suitable carriers were said to include gels, chewing gum, powders, mouthrinses, carbonated solutions and toothpaste.  These compositions are said to have long range structure; however, they are thought to be homogeneous when measured on an Angstrom Scale.  Under physiological conditions the amorphous calcium compounds have high solubilities, high formation rates and high rates of conversion to apatite.  The rates of formation and conversion allow remineralization of the<br>
3<br><br>
dental tissue to occur at a greater speed.  Doubts have been raised however with respect to the efficacy of such treatment.  Better systems need to be developed.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an oral product and method for building stronger, healthier teeth.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an oral product and method for remineralizing enamel which can be accomplished by a consumer without intervention of a dentist.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily apparent through the following summary and detailed discussion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
    An oral product is provided for remineralizing teeth<br>
which includes:<br>
(i)  a first composition comprising from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight of a water-soluble calcium phosphate or monolithic combination of water soluble calcium and phosphate salts, the composition having a pH less than 7; and (ii) a second composition including from about 0.01 to about 30% by weight of an alkaline material and an anticaries effective amount of a fluoride ion source, the second<br>
4<br><br>
composition having a pH greater than 7.5 and stored separately from the first composition in a manner to avoid contact between the phosphate and the alkaline material.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Unlike much of the previous technology, it has been found that remineralization products do not need to separate calcium from phosphate ions in a storage system prior to use  Now it has been discovered that a water soluble calcium phosphate salt can be stored within one composition held at a low pH.  Activation of this composition to deposit hydroxyapatite onto teeth is achieved by mixing this first composition with a second composition containing fluoride and having a high pH.<br>
Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, it is theorized that upon mixing against the teeth, the soluble calcium phosphate of the first composition interacts with fluoride of the second composition.  The alkaline environment of the second composition then causes precipitation of a calcium fluoro phosphate amorphous salt. Transformation of a monocalcium salt cascades downward to the di, octa and then eventually fluoridated hydroxyapatite in the presence of the high pH.  Preferably fluoride should only be in the second composition so that it co-precipitates as an element of hydroxyapatite.<br>
5<br><br>
Separate  storage  of  the  two  compositions  of   this invention may be  accomplished  through  a dual   compartment dispenser.     U.S.   Patent   4,687,663   (Schaeffer)   discloses   a dual-compartment  package  respectively  storing  a  peroxide gel   and a bicarbonate  paste.     Pump packaging with  multiple compartments  is   reported  in U.S.   Patent  5,038,963 (Pettengill   et   al. )    and  U.S.   Patent   5,020,694    (Pettengill) which  are embodied  in   a  U.S.   product   known  as  Mentadent® Baking  Soda  &amp;  Peroxide.<br>
Of  course,   delivery of  compositions  according  to  the present  invention  is  not  limited to unitary albeit multicompartmented dispensers  nor  to  totally segregated compartments.     The  dispenser may be  a  system in  the   form of two  individual  tubes  quite  separate   from one  another but packaged within  a  kit.     Ribbons  of  the dentifrice   from each tube  are delivered to  a  toothbrush with mixing  of  the compositions  occurring  in  the mouth.     Delivery may  also be from a  single chambered tube  except  that each of  the  two compositions are  semi   solid strips positioned side-by-side "touching but not mixing with one  another.     The  relatively high viscosity of the  products prevents any substantial transference of either pH change or components between  the two strips.     Illustrative of this  technology is  a U.S. product sold by Colgate® under  the Baking Soda   &amp;   Peroxide brand.     Still  another method of delivery may be  a  single composition such as  a paste or gel  housing an alkaline environment.     Monocalcium phosphate  compositions  may be dispersed throughout  the  alkaline  composition  yet  separated from contact by a coating encapsulating the phosphate.<br>
6<br><br>
Activation occurs  in  the  mouth through  the presence of water or  saliva which penetrates  the  encapsulating coating releasing phosphate  salt   to   interact  with  the  alkaline environment.<br>
A critical   component  of   the  first  composition of  this invention  is  a  water  soluble  calcium phosphate  salt.     By the  term "water  soluble"   is meant  a   solubility  of  at  least 0.1  gram in  100 ml  water  at  25°C.     Most preferred  is monocalcium hydrogen phosphate but  also  of potential use are calcium polyol  phosphates   (e.g.   calcium glycerophosphate)   and monocalcium ammonium phosphate salts.<br>
Monolithic compositions  of water soluble  calcium and phosphate salts may be  employed as alternatives  to pre¬formed water soluble  calcium phosphates.     By the  term "monolithic"  is meant  separate water  soluble  calcium salts and phosphate salts which  from solution may metathesize into calcium phosphates   in  solution or  later  upon mixing with the  second composition.     Illustrative  calcium salts include the halides,   sulphates,   nitrates,   citrates,   sugars and C1-C6 carboxylates.     Most preferred is calcium chloride,   calcium sulphate  and calcium acetate.     The monolithic partner phosphate  salts may be  alkali,   ammonium or combination  salts  thereof.     Examples  include  sodium ammonium phosphate,   sodium phosphate,   ammonium phosphate and potassium phosphate.     The water-soluble  calcium phosphate  salts  or the monolithic calcium and phosphate salts   (by weight of calcium and phosphate  ions only)  may be present  in amounts  ranging  from 0.01   to  30%,   preferably<br>
7<br><br>
from 0.1 to 20%, optimally from 1 to 10% by weight of the first composition.<br>
Solubility of the phosphate salt is maintained in the first composition by having an acidic environment.   The pH will be less than 7, preferably from 1 to 6.5, more preferably from 1.8 to 6, optimally from 2.5 to 5.5.<br>
The second composition of the present invention requires an alkaline material so that the second composition has a pH greater than 7, preferably from 7.2 to 11, more preferably from 8 to 10, optimally from 8.5 to 9.5.  Alkaline materials suitable to achieve the pH are sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and mixtures thereof.  Amounts of the alkaline material may range from 0.1 to 60%, preferably from 0.5 to 30%, more preferably from 1 to 20%, optimally from 3 to 15% by weight of the second composition.<br>
An important further component of the second composition is a fluoride anticaries compound. Illustrative of such fluoride compounds are sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, calcium fluoride, magnesium fluoride, stannous fluoride, stannous monofluorophosphate, sodium monofluorophosphate and copper fluoride. Most preferred is sodium fluoride.  These sources should release anywhere from about 25 to about 5,000 ppm of fluoride ion. ' The anticaries compound will normally be present in an<br>
8<br><br>
amount from about 0.01 to about 5%, preferably from 0.1 to 2.5%, optimally from 0.2 to 1.5% by weight of combined first and second compositions.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be in the form of either a toothpaste, gel, powder or mouthwash.<br>
Most preferably the compositions are either pastes or gels.  Especially suitable is where the phosphate salt is incorporated in a gel and the alkaline material incorporated into a paste.  These compositions may include water or be anhydrous.<br>
The phosphate salt as well as the alkaline material will be delivered through a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" will include such functional ingredients as water, humectants, abrasives, thickeners, surfactants and combinations thereof.  Total levels of these materials may range anywhere from about 1 to about 99%, preferably from 20  to 801, optimally from 30 to 60% by weight.<br>
Acidity in the first composition may be achieved by formulating with a peroxide such as hydrogen peroxide, inorganic acids such as phosphoric, hydrochloric, nitric or boric acids, and organic C2-C20 carboxylic acids such as citric, malic, lactic, alginic, succinic, tartaric and ascorbic acids.  Soluble salts may also be employed such as potassium bitartrats, sodium acid citrate, acid phosphate and pyrophosphate salts such as monosodium phosphate and disodium pyrophosphate.  Levels of the acidity inducing -<br>
9<br><br>
substances may range in amounts from about 0.1 to about 20%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 10%, optimally from 1.0 to 8% by weight of the first composition.  Hydrogen peroxide and phosphoric acid are the preferred substances.<br>
Among the carriers, water when present may range in amounts from about 1 to 95%, preferably from 20 to 60%, optimally from 30 to 50% by weight of each of the compositions.  Of course some formulations may be anhydrous.<br>
Humectants are usually also present as one of the carriers.  Illustrative of this category are sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, glycerin and polyethylene glycols (e.g. Carbowax).  Amounts of the humectant may range from 1 to 60%, preferably from about 5 to about 50%, optimally from 10 to 40% by weight of each composition.<br>
Abrasives are normally present in toothpastes and some gels.  These may include sodium metaphosphate, dicalcium phosphate (which is not considered a water-soluble phosphate), calcium pyrophosphate, silica, alumina, chalk, insoluble bicarbonate salts, and mixtures thereof. Amounts of the abrasives may range from about 1 to about 80%, preferably from 5 to 50% by weight of each composition.<br>
Thickeners are a further type of carrier which can be included in the compositions of this invention. Illustrative thickeners such as sodium carboxy- methyl cellulose, hydroxy ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl<br>
10<br><br>
ellulose, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, gum karaya, sodium lginate, carrageenan, guar, xanthan gum, Irish moss, tarch, modified starch, Carbomers (crosslinked acrylates) nd mixtures thereof.  Inorganic substances may also be uitable, especially silica aerogels and magnesium aluminum ilicate (e.g. Veegum).  Amounts of the thickener may range rom about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from 0.1 to 20%, Optimally from 0.5 to 15% by weight of a composition. Surfactants are also considered to be within the :arrier definition.  Surfactants may either be anionic, Lonionic, cationic or amphoteric.  Most preferred are iodium lauryl sulphate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate md sodium lauryl sarcosinate.   Surfactants may be present and an amount from about 0.5 to about 10%, preferably from 1.8 to 5% by weight of a composition.<br>
Gel compositions are structured with substances than can be characterized as either humectants or surfactants. for instance, a typical gel structurant is a polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymer such as those sold by the BASF Corporation under the trademark Pluronic® F88, F99, F108 and F127.  These materials are also known as Poloxamers and employed in amounts from about 5 to about 30%, preferably between about 18 and about 25% by weight of a composition.<br>
Flavors may also be present in the compositions. These flavors may be based on oils of spearmint and peppermint.  Examples of other flavoring materials include menthol, clove, wintergreen, eucalyptus and aniseed.<br>
11<br><br>
Flavors may range in concentration from about 0.1 to about 51 by weight of a composition.<br>
Sweetening agents may also be included such as saccharin, sodium cyclamate, aspartame, ace-sulfame, xylitol and combinations thereof at levels from 0.1 to 10% by weight of a composition.<br>
Gel compositions incorporating hydrogen peroxide may include a sequestering agent(s) such as a pyrophosphate or other phosphate for chelation of ferric/ferrous ion as well as other transition metal ions to enhance hydrogen peroxide stability.  The sequestering agents may also be included within the paste compositions and are present in amounts from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight of a composition. Most preferred chelatants are tetrasodium pyrophosphate,<br>
sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate, all known to be effective at lower pH with little affinity for<br>
calcium ion.  Other organic chelating agents such as sodium<br>
^citrate and zinc citrate are also useful.<br>
Other additives may also be incorporated such as preservatives, silicones, other synthetic or natural polymers such as Gantrez S97®, antitartar actives and antigingivitis actives.  Among the antitartar agents are<br>
included zinc citrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, disodium pyrophosphate, dipotassium pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate and mixtures thereof.  Antigingivitis actives<br>
 may include thymol, Triclosan, stannous gluconate and mixtures thereof. Amounts of each of the aforementioned<br>
12<br><br>
ingredients will depend upon their function.  Generally each of these substances will range in amounts from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight of a composition.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this<br>
invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the<br>
appended claims are by weight of either the first or second composition unless otherwise indicated.<br>

EXAMPLE   8<br>
Calcium phosphate remineralization technology according to the present invention was evaluated both through in vivo  and in vitro  tests.  Results are presented below.<br>
A)  Animal Caries<br><br>
Summary of Experimental  Design:     Sprague Dawley  rats  were  infected with caries producing bacteria,   then  treated<br>
20<br><br>
with slurries of experimental products for three weeks. The animals were also fed a cariogenic diet high in sugar.<br>
At end of treatment phase, teeth were scored for caries with total enamel caries incidence being the primary anticaries efficacy variable.<br>
TOTAL ENAMEL  CARIES  INDICENCE  -   1100 ppm F as NaF<br><br>
Dual phase silica base Baking Soda + Peroxide<br>
toothpaste without Fluoride. **   Dual phase silica base Baking soda + Peroxide<br>
toothpaste with 1,000 ppm Fluoride ion from NaF. ***  NaF dual phase silica base Baking Soda + Peroxide<br>
toothpaste with 1,200 ppm Ca, 8,000 ppm PO4 and 1,100<br>
ppm F ions.<br>
From the Table it is seen that the sodium fluoride formulation was significantly better for caries protection than the non-fluoride placebo.  Yet even more efficient was sodium fluoride in combination with calcium and phosphate in a system according to the present invention and as embodied in Example 1.<br>
B)  In Vitro Remineralization Studies<br>
Summary of Experimental Design:  Human enamel specimens were prepared to have artificial caries-like lesions.  The specimens had their initial surface hardness measured before initiation of the treatment phase.  The<br>
21<br><br>
cyclic treatment regimen consisted of treatment, remineralization and demineralization phases over the course of 21 days.  At the end of the treatment regimen, the specimen surface hardness was remeasured.  The change in their Vickers Hardness Numbers (Delta VHN) indicated the degree of remineralization provided by the test products.<br>
In Vitro Remineralization  (1100 ppm F as NaF)<br><br><br>

toothpaste with 1,200 ppm Ca, 8,000 pm PO4, 1,100 ppm<br>
Fluoride ion and 6,000 ppm Zn (as 2% zinc citrate)<br><br>
As in the in  vivo  studies, sodium fluoride as expected was better than the placebo having no fluoride. Incorporation of calcium and phosphate in accordance with the present invention and as shown in the system under Example 1 significantly improved teeth hardness relative to the same system containing only sodium fluoride.  An even<br>
22<br><br>
greater improvement in hardness was evidenced by the further addition of zinc citrate.<br>
In Vitro Remineralization (1500 ppm F as Sodium Monofluorophosphate)<br><br><br><br>
*   Dual phase silica base Baking Soda + Peroxide toothpaste without Fluoride<br>
**   MFP silica base toothpaste <usp ref. standard with ppm fluoride></usp>
***  MFP dual phase silica base Baking Soda + Peroxide toothpaste with 2,500 ppm Ca, 16,000 ppm PO4 and 1,500 ppm Fluoride ion.<br>
Sodium monofluorophosphate as expected was better for improving tooth hardness than a placebo without fluoride. Addition of calcium and phosphate according to the present invention significantly enhanced the activity of sodium monofluorophosphate.<br>
The foregoing description and examples illustrate selected embodiments of the present invention. In light thereof variations and modifications will be suggested to  one skilled in the art, all of which are within the spirit and purview of this invention.<br>
