				<td>Field of the Invention <br>
The invention pertains to aminomethylpyridyloxymethyl/benzisoxazole substituted azabicyclic compounds that, among other things, can singly serve as an effective 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and D2 receptor inhibitor, e.g. antagonist, inverse agonist and/or partial agonist. The invention also relates to an intermediate for preparation of said compounds; a pharmaceutical composition comprising said compounds; and the use of said compounds or other compounds having said effective 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and D2 receptor binding or inhibition in a method for treating certain CNS or other disorders.<br>
Background of the Invention Disorders of the Central Nervous System (CNS) can be medically treated in various ways. Of increasing importance in this regard are psychotropic drugs. But while such drugs have therapeutic effect, they also may cause unwanted and serious side effects. For example, schizophrenia can be treated with so-called typical drugs, which have been theorized to block certain dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain thought responsible for the positive symptoms of delusions, disordered thinking and the like. However, while these drugs can ameliorate some of the positive symptoms, they can also adversely affect the motor system, causing muscle problems such as spasms, cramps, tremors and Parkinsonism. Inasmuch as these types of side effects —generally characterized as Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)— can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities, resort has been made to so-called atypical drugs.<br>
Atypical antipsychotics have reduced incidents of EPS and can alleviate not only some of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but some of the negative symptoms as well, such as emotional unresponsiveness, social withdrawal and the like. Although antipsychotic drugs are believed to be more selective in their chemical effect on the brain, thereby reducing EPS, they too may have side effects. While these are not often as disruptive as those presented by typical drug therapy, they may nonetheless be of consequence to the patient. For example, atypical drugs can be sedating and can cause weight gain.<br>
The situation is further complicated when several CNS disorders are present in a patient. For example, psychosis, such as schizophrenia, can often co-exist with depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other such illnesses. In such cases, treatment often entails the administration of a combination of drugs, e.g., one to treat schizophrenia and one to treat depression or other co-morbid CNS ailment. Because each such drug has its own side effects, the combined administration can lead to a multiplication or enhancement of same, all to the detriment of the patient. Moreover, it is theorized that a different brain receptor, or combination or permutation of receptors, are somehow implicated in each of the various CNS disorders; for example, schizophrenia has been thought to involve<br><br><br>
D2 and 5HT-2A receptors whereas depression has been associated with 5HT-1B receptors. A class of aminomethylphenoxymethyl/benzisoxazole substituted azabicyclic compounds, useful as selective agonists and antagonists of serotonin 1 (5-HT1) receptors, is described in WO 99/52907 to Bright.<br>
It has hitherto proven difficult to find a single drug that can treat a patient suffering from diverse CNS disorders where a plurality of different receptors are in play. Accordingly, there is an on-going need for a psychotropic drug that has a pronounced reduction in side effects, and that can efficaciously and by itself treat multiple CNS disorders in which an antagonist or agonist to different receptors is indicated. Specifically, it would be desirable to find a drug that can concurrently treat schizophrenia and depression in which D2, 5HT-2A and 5HT-1B receptors are involved.<br>

In another animal model, compounds are tested for their ability to antagonize DOI (drug interaction) -induced head twitches as a measure of in vivo 5-HT2A antagonist activity. Administration of the 5-HT2A agonist, DOI, elicits a characteristic head shaking behavior (head twitch) that has been attributed to activation of 5-HT2A receptors. Compounds or vehicle are administered to habituated rats, 30 to 60 min sc prior to 3.2 mg/kg DOI, and head twitches are counted over a 30 min test period. The invention preferably comprises compounds with an ID50 of less than or equal to 10 mg/kg, sc in 5HT2A head twitch.<br>
In addition, compounds are tested for their ability to antagonize d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity as a measure of in vivo dopamine D2 receptor antagonist activity. Administration of low doses of the indirect dopamine agonist, d-amphetamine, produces a dramatic increase in horizontal locomotor activity in rats, a phenomenon which has been attributed to activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system, and which therefore provides a rodent model of the hyperdopaminergic activity implicated in schizophrenia. Compounds or vehicle are administered to habituated rats, 30-60 min s.c. prior to 1.0 mg/kg of d-amphetamine SO4, and iocomotor activity data are recorded in computer-monitored activity chambers for the 3 hour duration of the hyperactivity response. The invention includes compounds with an ID50 of less than or equal to 10 mg/kg, sc in d-amphetamine locomotor activity.<br>

The compounds of Formula I which are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate a compound of the Formula I from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent, and subsequently convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained.<br>
The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, e.g. salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate and pamoate, i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate), salts<br>

It may also be used with acetocholinesterases such as donepezil. It is to be understood that the present invention covers the use of a compound of Formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents.<br>
The compound of Formula I and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in combination with a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor (e.g. fluvoxamine, sertraline, fluoxetine or paroxetine), preferably sertraline, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or polymorph thereof (the combination of a compound of Formula I with a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor is referred herein to as "the active combination"), are useful psychotherapeutics and may be used in the treatment or prevention of disorders the treatment or prevention of which is facilitated by modulating serotonergic neurotransmission such as hypertension, depression (e.g. depression in cancer patients, depression in Parkinson's patients, postmyocardial infarction depression, subsyndromal symptomatic depression, depression in infertile women, pediatric depression, major depression, single episode depression, recurrent depression, child abuse induced depression, and post partum depression), generalized anxiety disorder, phobias (e.g. agoraphobia, social phobia and simple phobias), posttraumatic stress syndrome, avoidant personality disorder, premature ejaculation, eating disorders (e.g. anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa), obesity, chemical dependencies (e.g. addictions to alcohol, cocaine, heroin, phenobarbital, nicotine and benzodiazepines), cluster headache, migraine, pain, Alzheimer's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, memory disorders (e.g. dementia, amnestic disorders, and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD)), Parkinson's diseases (e.g. dementia in Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesias), endocrine disorders (e.g. hyperprolactinaemia), vasospasm (particularly in the cerebral vasculature), cerebellar ataxia, gastrointestinal tract disorders (involving changes in motility and secretion), negative symptoms of schizophrenia, premenstrual syndrome, fibromyalgia syndrome, stress incontinence, Tourette's syndrome, trichotiHomania, kleptomania, male<br><br>
impotence, cancer {e.g. small cell lung carcinoma), chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and headache (associated with vascular disorders).<br>
Serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitors, preferably sertraline, exhibit positive activity against depression; chemical dependencies; anxiety disorders including panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, simple phobias, social phobia, and post-traumatic stress disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; avoidant personality disorder and premature ejaculation in mammals, including humans, due in part to their ability to block the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin.<br>
Sertraline,	(1 S-cis)-4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyI-1-<br>
naphthalenamine, has the chemical formula C17H17NC12; its synthesis is described in U.S. Patent 4,536,518 incorporated herein by reference. Sertraline hydrochloride is useful as an antidepressant and anorectic agent, and is also useful in the treatment of depression, chemical dependencies, anxiety obsessive compulsive disorders, phobias, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and premature ejaculation.<br>
Activity of the active combination as antidepressants and related pharmacological properties can be determined by methods (1)-(4) below, which are described in Koe, B. et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 226 (3), 686-700 (1983). Specifically, activity can be determined by studying (1) their ability to affect the efforts of mice in escaping a swim-tank (Porsolt mouse "behavior despair" test), (2) their ability to potentiate 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced behavioral symptoms in mice in vivo, (3) their ability to antagonize the serotonin-depleting activity of p-chloroamphetamine hydrochloride in rat brain in vivo, and (4) their ability to block the uptake of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine by synaptosomal rat brain cells in vitro. The ability of the active combination to counteract reserpine hypothermia in mice in vivo can be determined according to the methods described in U.S. Patent 4,029,731.<br>

Thus, the compound of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parenteral (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous), transdermal (e.g. patch) or rectal administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically<br><br>
acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g. pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate. talc or silica); disintegrate (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
For buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compound of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in ampuies or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. They may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
In a further aspect, this invention provides compositions of matter suitable for administration to a human patient as a solution (e.g., as an injectable or intranasally), comprising an inclusion complex of a salt of the compounds of the invention in a material such as cyclodextrin. Advantageously, in a preferred embodiment said inclusion complex provides an amount of compound of at least 2.5 mgA/ml when the amount of compound provided by said complex is measured at a cyclodextrin concentration of 40% w/v in water. The inclusion complex of compound in cyclodextrin can first be isolated by drying, usually by lyophilization. The isolated dry inclusion complex can be stored at room temperature for periods up to two years and longer, and reconstituted into a product solution as needed. When a product solution is required, it can be made by dissolving the isolated inclusion complex in water (or other aqueous medium) in an amount sufficient to generate a solution of the required strength for oral or parenteral administration to patients. If parenteral administration is the chosen route of administration, intramuscular injection is preferred. The compounds may be formulated for fast dispersing dosage forms (fddf), which are designed to release the active ingredient in the oral cavity. These have often been formulated<br><br>
using rapidly soluble gelatin-based matrices. These dosage forms are well known and can be used to deliver a wide range of drugs. Most fast dispersing dosage forms utilize gelatin as a carrier or structure-forming agent. Typically, gelatin is used to give sufficient strength to the dosage form to prevent breakage during removal from packaging, but once placed in the mouth, the gelatin allows immediate dissolution of the dosage form. Alternatively, various starches are used to the same effect.<br>
The compound of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the compound of the invention is conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound. Capsules and cartridges (made e.g. from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
