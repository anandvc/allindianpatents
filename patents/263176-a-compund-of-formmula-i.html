				<td>P70 S6 KINASE INHIBITORS<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	p70 S6 kinase is a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/ mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and p70 S6 kinase is commonly activated in many human solid tumors.  p70 S6 kinase activity regulates ribosome biogenesis, cell growth, and cell cycle progression in response to mitogenic stimulation.  As such, suppressing p70 S6 kinase activity will block ribosome biogenesis, synthesis of select proteins, cell growth, and cell cycle progression.  Thus a role for p70 S6 kinase exists in tumor cell proliferation and protection of cells from apoptosis.  Furthermore, inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase are described as useful in treating infections, inflammation and tumor formation, as well as metabolic diseases and disorders.  (WO 2005/117909, WO 2006/071819, WO 2006/046024, WO 2007/125321 andWO 2008/012635).  The present invention provides surprisingly potent compounds that inhibit p70 S6 kinase activity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The general chemical terms used in the formulae above have their usual meanings.  For example, the term “C1-C4 alkyl” refers to a straight or branched, monovalent, saturated aliphatic chain of one to four carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, and t-butyl and the like.  Likewise, the term “C1-C3 alkyl” includes methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl and the like.  <br>
	As used herein the term “C1-C4 alkoxy” refers to a straight or branched alkyl chain having from one to four carbon atoms attached to an oxygen atom.  Typical C1-C4 alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, tert-butoxy and the like.  <br>
	As used herein, the terms "Halo" refer to a chlorine, bromine, iodine, or fluorine atom, unless otherwise specified herein.<br>
As used herein the term “C3-C6 cycloalkyl” means a fully saturated ring comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms and includes cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.<br>
As used herein, the term “C2-C6 alkynyl” is a straight or branched alkynyl chain having from two to six carbon atoms and one triple bond, including, but not limited to, ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, and the like.  <br>
Compounds of this invention are bases, and accordingly react with any of a number of organic and inorganic acids to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts and the present invention includes the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula I or IA.  The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein, refers to salts of the compounds of Formula I that are substantially non-toxic to living organisms.  Such salts include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2-19 (1977), which are known to the skilled artisan.  Hydrochloride, mesylate, and tosylate (also known as p-toluene sulfonate) salts are preferred salts.  The hydrochloride and tosylate salts are most preferred.   <br>
Some of the compounds of the present invention have one or more chiral centers and may exist in a variety of stereoisomeric configurations.  As a consequence of these chiral centers, the compounds of the present invention occur as racemates, mixtures of enantiomers and as individual enantiomers, as well as diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers.  All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention.  The specific stereoisomers and enantiomers of compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art utilizing well known techniques and processes, such as those disclosed by J. Jacques, et al., "Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1981, and E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen,” Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds”, (Wiley-Interscience 1994), and European Patent Application No. EP-A-838448, published April 29, 1998.  Examples of resolutions include recrystallization techniques or chiral chromatography.<br>
The skilled artisan will also appreciate that compounds of Formula I where R1 is hydrogen or where Z1 or Z2 are N exist as tautomers.  Although tautomers are structurally distinct, the skilled artisan will appreciate that they exist in equilibrium and are easily and rapidly interconvertible under ordinary conditions.  (See, March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Third Edition, Wiley Interscience, New York, New York (1985), pages 66-70; and Allinger, Organic Chemistry, Second Edition, Worth Publishers, New York, New York, (1976), page 173).  As such, the representation of a compound of Formula I in a single tautomeric form contemplates both tautomeric forms individually and mixtures thereof.  Likewise, the naming of a compound of Formula I where, for example, R1 is hydrogen either as 1H-imidazole or a 3H-imidazole contemplates both tautomeric forms.  <br>
Certain classes of compounds of Formula I are preferred p70 S6 kinase inhibitors.  The following paragraphs describe such preferred classes:<br>

	Other preferred compounds of Formula I are those where Y is CR6 and R1 is H or CH3.   Additional preferred compounds of Formula I are those where Y is CR6 and R1 is H or CH3; and R2 is phenyl substitued with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and optionally further substituted with a second substituent which is halo.<br>
Preferred compounds of Formula I also include those where Y is CR6 and R1 is H or CH3; R2 is phenyl substitued with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and optionally further substituted with a second substituent which is halo; R5 is H; Z1 is CR3 and Z2 is N.  <br>
Also preferred are those compounds of Formula I in which Y is CH; R1 is H or CH3; R2 is phenyl substituted with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and optionally further substituted with a second substituent which is halo; R5 is H; Z1 is CH; and Z2 is N.<br>
In addition, preferred are those compounds of Formula I in which Y is CH; R1 is H or CH3; R2 is phenyl substituted with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and further substituted with a second substituent which is halo; R5 is H; Z1 is CH; and Z2 is N.<br>
More preferred compounds of Formula I are those in which Y is CH; R1 is H or CH3; R2 is phenyl substituted in the 3 position with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and optionally further substituted in the 4 position with a second substituent which is halo; R5 is H; Z1 is CH; and Z2 is N.<br>
In addition, more preferred compounds of Formula I are those in which Y is CH; R1 is H or CH3; R2 is phenyl substituted in the 3 position with a first substituent selected from the group consisting of halo and trifluoromethyl, and further substituted in the 4 position with a second substituent which is halo; R5 is H; Z1 is CH; and Z2 is N.<br>
Particularly preferred are those compounds of Formula I in which Y is CH, Z1 is CH and Z2 in N.  <br>
The following compound, 4-{4-[4-(3-(Trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-piperidin-1-yl}-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine:<br>
 , <br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt therefore, is most especially preferred.<br>
Additionally, the compound 4-{4-[4-(4-Fluoro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-piperidin-1-yl}-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine:<br>
 , <br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,  is also most especially preferred.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase and are therefore useful in the treatment of metabolic diseases and disorders such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperaminoacidemia, and hyperlipidemia, and proliferative disorders, particularly glioblastoma multiforme, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and renal cell carcinoma in mammals.  In addition, it has been found that the p70 S6 kinase pathway is activated in cells of benign tumors, such as those associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).  See Journal of Bological Chemistry, 277:34, 30958-30967 (2002), and Modern Pathology 19, 839-846 (2006).  Thus p70 S6 kinase inhibitors may also be useful in treating LAM.  Inhibitors of p70 S6 kinase are also useful inhibitors of angiogenesis in mammals.  It is preferred that the mammal to be treated is a human.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art following art recognized techniques and procedures.  More specifically, compounds of Formula I can be prepared as set forth in the schemes, methods, and examples set forth below.  It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the individual steps in the following schemes may be varied to provide the compounds of Formula I or IA.   The reagents and starting materials are readily available to one of ordinary skill in the art.  All substituents, unless otherwise specified, are as previously defined.  Some substituents have been eliminated in the following schemes for the sake of clarity and are not intended to limit the teaching of the schemes in any way.<br>
Compounds of Formula I may be prepared as illustrated in the following scheme where R1, R2, R4, R5, Z1, Z2 and Y are as previously defined, and L is a suitable leaving group such as halo.  <br><br>
SCHEME 1<br><br>
A substituted pyrazolopyrimidine (or purine or pyrrolopyrimidine) compound of formula (a) is reacted with a substituted piperazine or piperidine of formula (b) to form compounds of Formula I or IA.  For example, a solution of a compound of formula (a), the piperazine (b) and a suitable base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, or N-methylmorpholine, in a suitable solvent, such as propanol or isopropyl alcohol are heated to about 70°C-100°C to provide compounds of Formula I or IA, which may then be isolated and, if necessary and desired, purified using techniques well known in the art, such as chromatography.<br>
Compounds of formula (a) are commercially available, or may be synthesized by methods known to the skilled artisan.  For example, compounds of formula (a) where Z1 is CR3 and Z2 is N may be prepared from allopurinol by reaction with a chlorinating agent such as phosphoryl chloride and heating to about 80°C-90°C.  Further, compounds of formula (a) may be substituted if desired under conditions well known in the art.  For example, a compound of formula (a) where Z1 or Z2 is CR3 is fluorinated upon exposure an appropriate fluorinating  agent, such as [1-(chloromethyl)-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octanebis(tetrafluoroborate)] in a suitable solvent or mixture of suitable solvents, such as acetonitrile and acetic acid.  Moreover, compounds of formula (a) where R3 is alkyl or cycloalkyl are synthesized by methods known in the art.  For instance, dichloropyrimidine is reacted with cyclopropane carbaldehyde in the presence of strong base such as LDA, in a solvent such as THF, at cooled temperatures to produce the requisite alcohol.  Oxidation in the presence of chromium (VI) oxide at 0 °C in a suitable solvent such as acetone provides the required ketone, which is then reacted with hydrazine hydrate in a suitable solvent such as THF at room temperature to provide clycloalkyl-substituted pyrazolopyrimidine compounds of formula (a).   Additionally, methods of producing compounds where R3 is alkynyl are known to the skilled artisan.  For example, a chlorinated compound of formula (a) trimethylsilylacetylene in triethylamine and a suitable solvent such as DMF and/or THF using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(Ph3P)4) as a catalyst to afford the ethynylsubstituted compound of formula (a).  <br>
The requisite piperidine/piperazine compounds (b) may be prepared as illustrated in the following scheme, where R1, R2, R4, R5 and Y are as previously described, and PG is a suitable protecting group.  <br>
SCHEME 2<br><br><br>
Amine (c) is reacted with a protected piperidine in the presence of suitable coupling agents such as isobutyl chloroformate, 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1-propanephosphonic acid cyclic anhydride (PPA) and an appropriate base such as  N-methylmorpholine or triethylamine, in a suitable solvent such as THF, methylene chloride, or N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) at reduced temperatures to form amide compounds of formula (d).  The subsequent imidazole piperidine (b1), where Y is CR6 is formed upon exposure of compound (d) to ammonium acetate or ammonium chloride in a sealed vessel, or for compounds where R5 is H, upon exposure to microwave heat under pressure.  Alternatively, compounds of formula (b1) may be formed by reacting amidine (e) with an appropriate halo ketone in a suitable solvent, such as DMF or acetone, in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate, followed by deprotection under conditions well-known to the skilled artisan.  Hydroxypiperidines of formula (b1) may also synthesized by reacting a phenacyl bromide of formula (m) with formamide in the presence of heat.  The imidazole (n) is then added to a suitable solvent such as THF, cooled, and treated with a nitrogen protecting group such as 2,2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy-methyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydride while allowing the reaction mixture to warm to room temperature to provide the intermediate of formula (o).  The subsequent protected imidazole may then be treated with a metalating agent, such as n-butyllithium, in an inert solvent, such at THF, under reduced temperatures and under an inert atmosphere.  This mixture is treated with an appropriately substituted piperdinone and allowed to warm to room temperature for about 1 h to give compounds of type (p). Treatment of intermediate (p) with an aqueous acid such as 1 N HCl at elevated temperatures gives (b1).<br>
The required amidines may be synthesized as described in scheme 3, wherein PG is a suitable protecting group: <br>
SCHEME 3<br><br><br>
Amidine (e) is readily produced from nitriles.  More specifically, hydroxylamine hydrochloride dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as water, is reacted with cyanopiperidine (g) in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate in a suitable solvent, such as  in methanol and exposed to heat to provide the hydroxycarbamimidoyl-piperidine (h).  The hydroxycarbamimidoylpiperidine (h) in a suitable solvent, such as acetic acid, is then hydrogenated via palladium catalyst in the presence of acetic acid anhydride under pressure to provide amidine (e). <br>
	Alternatively, a carboximidic acid (j) is formed by dissolving cyanopiperidine (g) in a suitable solvent such as methanol, cooling, then reacting with hydrogen chloride gas. The amidine is then produced by treating carboximidic acid (j)  with ammonia in methanol, then saturating the mixture with ammonia gas.  <br>
	The skilled artisan will appreciate that not all of the substituents in the compounds of Formula I will tolerate certain reaction conditions employed to synthesize the compounds.  These moieties may be introduced at a convenient point in the synthesis, or may be protected and then deprotected as necessary or desired.  The skilled artisan will also appreciate that the protecting groups may be removed at any convenient point in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.  Methods for introducing and removing nitrogen protecting groups are well known in the art; see, for example, Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York, Chapter 7 (1999).  Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate than in many circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical. The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound and the relative lability of the substituted moieties. <br>

Heat a mixture of 4-(4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)piperidine (270 mg, 0.91 mmol), 4-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (280 mg, 1.82 mmol), Et3N (0.63 mL, 4.5 mmol), and 2-propanol (10 mL) at 90 °C overnight under N2.  Cool the mixture to room temperature and pour into water (100 mL).  Extract the mixture with CH2Cl2 (2×200 mL), combine the organic layers, and wash with water (50 mL).  Dry (Na2SO4) the organic layer, filter the mixture, and concentrate the filtrate in vacuo.  Purify the residue by silica gel chromatography (25 g of SiO2, elute with CH2Cl2/CMA 4:1, 1000 mL) to provide 4-(4-(5-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (304 mg, 80%).  Add hydrochloric acid (2.0 M aqueous, 0.36 mL, 0.72 mmol) to a suspension of 4-(4-(5-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (300 mg, 0.72 mmol) in methanol (7 mL).  Concentrate the mixture in vacuo to dryness.  Dissolve the residue in methanol (2 mL) and add diethyl ether (50 mL) to form a precipitate.  Filter the precipitate, and wash the filter cake with Et2O.  Dissolve the solid in methanol (10 mL) and remove the solvent in vacuo to dryness to provide 4-(4-(5-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine hydrochloride (210 mg, 65%) as an off-white solid.

General Procedure for the Preparation of Salts and Crystals<br>
A master plate is prepared with 250 µL of the free base of the subject compound in methanol (0.1 M) added to all wells set in a 96 well format.  An array of acids is dispensed to each well in stoichiometric molar equivalents.  The solvents are evaporated from all 96 wells using a Genevac Series II evaporator leaving solid residues or oils in the master plate.  An array of solvents is dispensed to each one of these wells through a sealing gasket and then heated to 55°C with stirring and allowed to equilibrate for 60 - 90 minutes at about 55°C.  Each sample is then filtered hot and transferred to corresponding wells in an evaporation plate, a precipitation plate, and a cooling plate.  The evaporation plate is prepared by transferring 200 µL of the filtrate from the master plate using 55°C heated syringes to the open well titer plate and is then allowed to evaporate to dryness over night at room temperature and ambient humidity.  The precipitation plate is prepared by adding 100 µL of the filtrate from the master plate using 55°C heated syringes to a gasket-sealed 96 well titer plate where each well contains an anti-solvent of 200 µL of heptane or water.  After equilibrating for a period of nine hours at room temperature, the excess solution is wicked away using pre-cut Whatman filter paper.  The cooling plate is prepared by transferring 200 µL of the filtrate from the master plate to individual wells using 55°C heated syringes in a gasket-sealed titer plate, and cooling exponentially from 55°C to 10°C over a period of 8 hours.  Photomicrographs are collected on the material in each well in the 96 well plates using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted incident-light microscope with a 2.5X objective.  If the material is crystalline, it exhibits birefringence that is displayed as white against a dark background.  Amorphous solids or oils appear dark or as opaque droplets or rings. <br><br>

Determination of p70 S6K In Vivo Target Inhibition (HCT 116) <br>
HCT 116 human colon carcinoma cells* (5 x 106) are subcutaneously implanted into the flank of athymic nude mice in 0.2 mL of matrigel.  Two weeks post-implantation, mice are dosed PO according to a time course, single dose/single time point, or dose response protocol for the determination of TMED50 (threshold minimum effective dose).  Tumors are flash frozen at harvest and blood is collected for the determination of parent compound plasma exposure and the calculation of TMEC50 (threshold minimum effective concentration) in the case of dose response studies.  Tumors or tissues are homogenized in XY Lysis buffer (10?g/mL Leupeptin, 10 µg/mL Trypsin-Chymotrypsin Inhibitor, 10 µg/mL Tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), 10 µg/mL Aprotinin, 60 mM Beta-Glycerol Phosphate, 1% Triton X100, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2.5 mM Pyrophosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME), 15 mM para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), 5 mM Benzamidine, 1 mM Na Vanadate, 10 mM NaF, 50 ?g/mL  phenylmethane sulofnyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM DTT, 15 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 5 mM EGTA pH 8.0, 1 µM Microcystin, 1 µM Okadaic Acid, and 1 Roche Complete protease inhibitor mini-tablet per 10 mL) using Lysing Matrix A tubes (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, cat# 6910-500) and a BIO101 Thermo Savant Fast Prep FP12.  Lysates are aliquoted and either assayed immediately or stored at -80 °C for later testing.  In Vivo Target Inhibition of p70 S6K is measured utilizing Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD) ELISA technology to assess effects of the compound on phosphorylation of the serine 240/244 site of the downstream effector S6RP.  Phosphorylation of p70 S6K(T389) and Akt(S473) is also assessed using this technology in a multiplex format. In summary, 20 µg of lysate is added to a carbon electrode 96-well plate pre-spotted with the appropriate capture antibodies.  The protein of interest is probed using a ruthenium labeled detection antibody.  Upon the passage of current over the electrode in the presence of read buffer containing the co-reactant TPA, electro-chemiluminescence results in the generation of light which is quantified and recorded using the MSD Sector 6000 instrument.  For each study, percent inhibitions are calculated relative to the vehicle control group and ANOVA analysis is performed using the JMP software package for the determination of statistical significance.  The following compounds were tested essentially as described above and have the following potencies based on plasma exposure. <br>

Oral administration of the compounds of the present invention is preferred.  However, oral administration is not the only route or even the only preferred route.  For example, transdermal administration may be very desirable for patients who are forgetful or petulant about taking oral medicine, and the intravenous route may be preferred as a matter of convenience or to avoid potential complications related to oral administration.  Compounds of Formula I may also be administered by the percutaneous, intramuscular, intranasal or intrarectal route in particular circumstances.  The route of administration may be varied in any way, limited by the physical properties of the drugs, the convenience of the patient and the caregiver, and other relevant circumstances (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1990)).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art. The carrier or excipient may be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material that can serve as a vehicle or medium for the active ingredient.  Suitable carriers or excipients are well known in the art.  The pharmaceutical composition may be adapted for oral, inhalation, parenteral, or topical use and may be administered to the patient in the form of tablets, capsules, aerosols, inhalants, suppositories, solutions, suspensions, or the like. <br>
A pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprising a compound such as herein described, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient showed unexpected and surprising results.  Therefore, the said composition is synergistic.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention, alone, or optionally in combination with an oncolytic,  cytotoxic  agent,  or  therapeutic  agent,  are  usually  administered  in  the  form  of <br>
pharmaceutical formulations which may be administered orally, for example, with an inert diluent or capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gums and the like.  These preparations should contain at least 4% of the compound of the present invention, the active ingredient, but may be varied depending upon the particular form and may conveniently be between 4% to about 70% of the weight of the unit.  The amount of the compound present in compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.  Preferred compositions and preparations of the present invention may be determined by methods well known to the skilled artisan. <br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like may also contain one or more of the following adjuvants: binders such as povidone, hydroxypropyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, or gelatin; excipients or diluents such as: starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or dicalcium phosphate, disintegrating agents such as:  croscarmellose, crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, corn starch and the like; lubricants such as:  magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc or hydrogenated vegetable oil; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; wetting agents such as:  sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80; and sweetening agents such as:  sucrose, aspartame or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent such as:  peppermint, methyl salicylate or orange flavoring.  When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as polyethylene glycol or a fatty oil. Other dosage unit forms may contain other various materials that modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, as coatings. Thus, tablets or pills may be coated with sugar, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polymethacrylates, or other coating agents. Syrups may contain, in addition to the present compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain preservatives, dyes and colorings and flavors.  Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
The compounds of Formula I are generally effective over a wide dosage range.  For example, dosages per day normally fall within the range of about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg of body weight.  In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, and therefore the above dosage range is not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.  It will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound or compounds administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.<br>
For example, one formation may include a compound of Formula 1 and 2.223 ?L of 1N NaOH per mg of compound, with 1% HEC / 0.25% Tween 80 / 0.05% Antifoam 1510-US vehicle according to the following calculation:  mL of vehicle to add = (mg of compound / Theoretical mg/mL) - (mg of compound / 1200 mg/mL estimated compound density) - mL of 1N NaOH added.   Another formulation may include  5% vitamin E-TPGS, 1% hydroxyethylcellulose, and 0.05% Dow Corning Antifoam in purified water.<br>
The bioavailability of compounds of the present invention may be measured by methods known to the skilled artisan.  For example a compound of Formula I is  administered to Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 1 mg/kg (IV) or 10 mg/kg (oral gavage) in a conventional formulation.  An oral formulation may include a suspension (0.25% PS80, 1% HEC, 0.05% Antifoam in water) using milled compound of Formula I.   Plasma samples are obtained and concentrations of the compound of Formula I are measured.  The compound of Example 57 was evaluated in a method substantially similar to that described above and found to have an oral bioavailability of &gt;100%. <br><br>
