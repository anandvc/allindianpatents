				<td>Field  of  the  Invention<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  a  carbon  fiber  and a  process  and  composition  for  manufacturing  a  mat.    More specifically, it relates to a carbon fiber having a very small fiber  diameter,   for  example,   0.001  to  5  {am,   a  process  for manufacturing  a  mat  and  a  composition  used  for  the manufacture  of  a  mat.<br>
Description  of  the  Prior  Art<br>
A carbon fiber is used as a filler for high-performance composite materials because it has excellent characteristic properties such as high strength,  high elastic modulus,  high conductivity and light weight.    As for its use, it is expected to be  used not  only as  a reinforcing filler for  the  purpose of improving mechanical strength as in the prior art but also as  a conductive  resin  filler  for electromagnetic  shielding materials  and antistatic materials,  making  use  of  the  high conductivity  of  a  carbon  material,   or  as  a  filler  for electrostatic  coatings  for resins.    It  is  also  expected  to be  used  as  a  field  electron  emitting  material  for  flat displays  and  the  like,   making  use  of  the  characteristic properties of a carbon material such as chemical stability, thermal  stability  and  micro-structure.<br>
Heretofore,  the carbon fiber has been manufactured by carbonizing  a  fibrous  carbon  precursor  such  as polyacrylonitrile,   pitch  or  cellulose  by  heating  at  a temperature  of  1,000"C  or  higher.    The  carbon  fiber manufactured  by  this  process  is  a  continuous  fiber  having a fiber diameter of 5 to 20 nm and the manufacture of a carbon<br><br>
fiber  having  a  fiber  diameter  smaller  than  5  ‘m  is substantially  impossible.<br>
Research into a carbon fiber (Vapor Grown Carbon Fiber; to  be  abbreviated  as  VGCF  hereinafter)  manufactured  by  a vapor phase process was  started in the  latter half of  1980, and the carbon fiber has  been manufactured on an industrial scale.    As examples of its production process,  JP-A 60-27700 (the  term  "JP-A"  as  used  herein  means  an  "unexamined published Japanese patent application")  discloses a process for manufacturing  a  carbon  fiber by  introducing  an  organic compound  such  as  benzene  as  a  raw  material  and  an  organic transition  metal  compound  such  as  kerosene  as  a  catalyst into  a  high-temperature  reaction  furnace  together  with  a carrier  gas  to  grow  a  carbon  fiber  on  a  substrate,   JP-A 60-54998  discloses  a process  for growing VGCF  in a floating state,  and  Japanese  Patent  No.  2778434  discloses  a  process for growing a carbon fiber on the wall of a reaction furnace. Since  VGCF  has  a  small  diameter  and  is  not  continuous,   it physically  differs  from  the  carbon  fiber  of  the  prior  art and has a fiber diameter of several hundreds of nm and a length<br>
of several tens of [xm. As the fine carbon fiber has higher heat conductivity and electric conductivity and is hardly eroded, it differs from the carbon fiber of the prior art functionally and is greatly expected to be used in a wide variety  of  fields.<br>
JP-A 2001-73226 discloses a process for manufacturing a fine carbon fiber from a composite fiber of a phenolic resin and polyethylene. Although this process has the possibility of manufacturing a fine carbon fiber at a lower cost than the above vapor phase process, the phenolic resin must be stabilized by a wet process for a long time and is hardly aligned and hardly graphitized, with result that the development of strength and elastic modulus from the obtained fine  carbon  fiber  cannot  be  expected.<br><br>
Summary  of  the  Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a  process  for  manufacturing  a  carbon  fiber.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for manufacturing a fine carbon fiber, for example, a fine carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of 0.001 to 5 ‘im  efficiently  at  a  low  cost.<br>
It  is  still  another  object  of  the  present  invention to provide a process  for manufacturing a carbon fiber which has  few  branched  structures  and  high  strength  and  a  high elastic  modulus  efficiently  at  a  low  cost.<br>
It  is  a  further  object  of  the  present  invention  to provide a process  for manufacturing a carbon fiber mat made of  the  above  carbon  fiber,  especially  a mat  made  of  a  fine carbon  fiber  efficiently  at  a  low  cost.<br>
It  is  a still  further object  of  the present  invention to  provide  a  composition  for  manufacturing  a  carbon  fiber suitably  used  in  the  above  manufacturing  process  of  the present  invention.<br>
It  is  a  still  further object  of  the present  invention to  provide  particularly  preferred  use  of  a  carbon  fiber obtained  by  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  present invention.<br>

Fig. 3 shows the dependence on shear rate of the melt viscosities  of  PE  and  pitch.<br>
Detailed  Description  of  the  Preferred  Embodiments<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinunder. The process for manufacturing a carbon  fiber  will  be  first  described  hereinunder.<br>
In  the  step  (1),   a mixture  of  100  parts  by weight  of a  thermoplastic  resin  and  1  to  150  parts  by  weight  of  a thermoplastic carbon precursor is spun into a precursor fiber or  formed  into  a  precursor  film.<br>
As  the  thermoplastic  resin  is  preferably  used  a thermoplastic resin having a weight reduction in the air at 500° C measured by TGA of  90  %  or more  and a weight  reduction<br><br>
in the air at  1,000° C of 97  % or more because it can be easily removed in the  step  (3)  from the  stabilized precursor fiber or  film  produced  in  the  step   (2).    Preferably,   the thermoplastic  resin  has  a  crystal  melting  point  of  100  to 400° C  when  it  is  crystalline  and  a  glass  transition temperature of  100  to  250° C when it  is  amorphous  because  it can  be  easily  melt  kneaded  with  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor  and  melt  spun.<br>
When the crystal melting point of the crystalline resin is  higher  than  400° C,  melt  kneading must  be  carried  out  at a  temperature  of  400°C  or  higher,  which  may  cause  the decomposition  of  the  resin  disadvantageously.    When  the glass transition point of the amorphous resin is higher than 250°C,   it  is  difficult  to  handle  the  resin  because  the viscosity of  the  resin  at  the  time  of melt  kneading  is  very high.    Preferably,   the  thermoplastic  resin  has  high permeability  for  gas  such  as  oxygen  or  halogen  gas  from another  point  of  view.    Therefore,  the  thermoplastic  resin used  in  the  present  invention  preferably has  a  free  volume diameter  at  20° C  evaluated by  a positron  extinction method of  0.50  nm  or  more.    When  the  free  volume  diameter  at  20° C evaluated by the positron extinction method is  smaller than 0.50  nm,  the permeability for  gas  such as  oxygen or halogen gas deteriorates and the time in the step  (2)  of stabilizing the carbon precursor contained in the precursor fiber or film to produce a stabilized precursor fiber or film becomes very long,  thereby greatly reducing production  efficiency.    The free  volume  diameter  at  20° C  evaluated  by  the  positron extinction method  is  more  preferably  0.52  nm or more,  much more preferably 0.55 nm or more.    The upper limit of the free volume  diameter  is  not  particularly  limited but  preferably as large as possible.    The preferred range of the free volume diameter  is  preferably  0.5  to  1  nm,  more  preferably  0.5  to 2  nm.<br><br>
The  difference  in  surface  tension  between  the thermoplastic resin  and the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor is  preferably  15 mN/m or  less.    The mixture  in  the  step  (1) is formed by blending the thermoplastic resin with the carbon precursor.    Therefore,  when  the  difference  in  surface tension between  the  carbon precursor  and the  thermoplastic resin  is  larger  than  15  mN/m,   the  dispensability  in  the thermoplastic resin of the carbon precursor lowers  and also the  carbon  precursor  readily  agglomerates  in  the thermoplastic  resin.    The  difference  in  surface  tension between the thermoplastic resin and the carbon precursor is more  preferably  10  mN/m or  less,  particularly preferably  5 mN/m  or  less.<br>
The  thermoplastic  resin  having  the  above characteristic  feature  is,   for  example,   a  polymer represented  by  the  following  formula  (I):<br>
wherein R’, R’, R’ and R"" are each independently a hydrogen atom, alkyl group having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl group having 5 to 10 carbon atoms, aryl group having 6 to 12 carbon atoms or aralkyl group having 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and n  is  an  integer of  20  or more,  preferably 20  to  100,000.<br>
The  thermoplastic  resin  represented  by  the  above formula  (I)   is  selected  from  polyethylene,   amorphous polyolefin,   a  homopolymer  of  4-methylpentene-l  and  a copolymer  of  4-methylpentene-l  and  other  olefin  such  as  a copolymer  of  poly-4-methylpentene-l  and  a  vinyl-based monomer.    Examples  of  the  polyethylene  include  hompolymers of ethylene and copolymers  of  ethylene and an a-olefin  such as  high-pressure  low-density  polyethylene, intermediate-density  polyethylene,   high-density<br><br>
polyethylene  and  linear  low-density  polyethylene;   and copolymers  of  ethylene  and  other  vinyl-based  monomer  such as  a  copolymer  of  ethylene  and vinyl  acetate.    Examples  of the  a-olefin  to  be  copolymerized  with  ethylene  include propylene,  1-butene,  1-hexene and 1-octene.    Examples of the other vinyl-based monomer include vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate;   and  (meth)acrylic  acids  and  alkyl  esters  thereof such  as   (meth)acrylic  acid,  methyl  (meth)acrylate,   ethyl (meth)acrylate  and  n-butyl   (meth)acrylate.<br>
The thermoplastic carbon precursor used in the present invention  is  selected  from  pitch,   polyacrylonitrile, polycarbodiimide,   polyimide,   polybenzazole  and  aramide. They  are  easily  carbonized  or  graphitized  at  a  high temperature  of  1,000°C  or  higher.    Out  of  these,   pitch, polyacrylonitrile  and  polycarbodiimide  are  preferred,  and pitch is more preferred.    Meso-phase pitch which is generally expected  to  have  high  strength  and high  elastic modulus  is particularly  preferred.<br>
The pitch is a mixture of condensation polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are obtained as the residue of coal or oil after distillation or as raw materials and is generally amorphous and optically isotropic (generally called "isotropic pitch" ). When this isotropic pitch having steady properties is heated in an inert gas atmosphere at 350 to 500°C, it may be converted into meso-phase pitch including nematic-phase pitch liquid crystals, which shows anisotropy optically in the end through various stages. The meso-phase pitch may be obtained from an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or naphthalene. The meso-phase pitch may also be called "isotropic pitch" or "liquid crystal pitch" from its characteristic properties. The meso-phase pitch is preferably obtained from an aromatic hydrocarbon such as naphthalene because it is easily stabilized and carbonized or graphitized.    The  above  thermoplastic  carbon precursors<br><br>
may  be  used  alone  or  in  combination  of  two  or  more.<br>
The thermoplastic carbon precursor is used in an amount of 1 to 150 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 100 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin. When the amount of the carbon precursor is larger than 150 parts by weight, a precursor fiber or film having a desired dispersion diameter cannot be obtained and when the amount is smaller than 1 part by weight, the target fine carbon fiber cannot  be  produced  at  a  low  cost  disadvantageously.<br>
In order to produce a mixture of the thermoplastic resin and  the  carbon  precursor  organic  compound  (A),   it  is preferred  to  knead  them  together  in  a  molten  state. Particularly,   the  ratio  (TIM/I1A)  of  the  melt  viscosity  (TIM) of the thermoplastic resin  to the melt viscosity  (T]A)  of  the thermoplastic carbon precursor at  the time of melt kneading<br>
is  preferably  0.5  to  50.    Even  when  the  ratio   (TIM/THA)   is smaller  than  0.5  or  larger  than  50,   the  dispersibility  in the  thermoplastic  resin  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor becomes unsatisfactory.    The ratio  (TIM/T1A)  is more preferably 0.7  to  5.    To melt knead the thermoplastic resin with  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor,   a  known  kneading machine  such  as  a  single-screw  extruder,   double-screw extruder,  mixing roll or Banbury mixer may be used.    Out  of these,  a same-direction double-screw extruder is preferably used to disperse the thermoplastic carbon precursor into the thermoplastic resin  finely.    The melt  kneading  temperature is,   for  example,   100  to  400° C,    When  the  melt  kneading temperature  is  lower  than  100°C,   the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor  does  not  melt,   thereby  making  it  difficult  to disperse  it  into  the  thermoplastic  resin  finely.    When  the temperature  is  higher  than  400°C,  the  decomposition  of  the thermoplastic resin  and the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor proceeds  disadvantageously.    The melt kneading  temperature is preferably in the range of 150 to 300° C.    The melt kneading<br><br>
time is  0.5  to  20 minutes,  preferably  1  to  15 minutes.    When the  melt  kneading  time  is  shorter  than  0.5  minute,   it  is difficult  to  disperse  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor finely.    When the melt kneading time is longer than 20 minutes, the  productivity  of  the  fine  carbon  fiber  greatly  drops disadvantageously.    The melt  kneading of  the  thermoplastic resin  and the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  is  preferably carried  out  in  an  atmosphere  containing  less  than  10  %  of oxygen  gas.    When  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  used in  the  present  invention  is  reacted  with  oxygen,   it  is modified and infusible at the time of melt kneading,  whereby the  fine  dispersion  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor into the thermoplastic resin may be impeded.    Therefore,  it is  preferred  that  melt  kneading  should  be  carried  out  by circulating an inert gas to reduce the content of oxygen gas as much as  possible.    The  content  of  oxygen  gas  at  the  time of melt kneading is preferably less than 5 %, more preferably less  than  1  %.<br>
The  above  mixture  of  the  thermoplastic  resin  and  the thermoplastic carbon precursor may contain a compatibilizing agent  for  the  thermoplastic  resin  and  the  thermoplastic carbon  precursor.    The  compatibilizing  agent  is  preferably added  at  the  time  of  melt  kneading.<br>
The  compatibilizing  agent  is  preferably  a  polymer<br>
selected from (E)  a copolymer of a polymer segment  (el) which<br>
satisfies the following expression  (1) and a polymer segment<br>
(e2)  which  satisfies  the  following  expression   (2):<br>
0.7  
tension  of  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor)   
0.7  
tension  of  thermoplastic  resin)   
and  (F)   a  homopolymer  which  satisfies  the  following expressions   (3)   and  (4): 0.7  
 <br>
of  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor)   
0.7 
of  thermoplastic  resin)   
When the above compatibilizing agent is used, the dispersion particle diameter of the thermoplastic carbon precursor in the thermoplastic resin becomes small and the particle size distribution thereof becomes narrow, whereby the finally obtained carbon fiber becomes finer and has a narrower fiber size distribution than the carbon fiber of the  prior  art.<br>
Consequently,   even  when  the  amount  of  the  carbon precursor  based  on  the  thermoplastic  resin  gradually increases,  it can be avoided that the both materials contact each  other  and  fuse  together  immediately.<br>
The  above  expression  (1)  for  the  above  copolymer  (E) represents  the  ratio  of  the  surface  tension  of  the thermoplastic carbon precursor to the surface tension of the polymer  segment   (el).    That  is,   it  shows  the  parameter  of interfacial surface energy between the polymer segment  (el) and  the  carbon  precursor.    When  this  ratio  is  smaller  than 0.7  or  larger  than  1.3,   interfacial  tension  between  the polymer  segment  (el)  and  the  carbon precursor becomes  high and therefore,  interfacial  adhesion between  the  two phases becomes  unsatisfactory.    The  ratio  of  the  surface  tension of the carbon precursor to the surface tension of the polymer segment  (el)  is preferably 0.75 to 1.25,  more preferably 0.8 to 1.2.    The polymer segment (el) is not particularly limited if it satisfies the above expression (1).    Preferred examples of  the  polymer  segment   (el)   include  polyolefin-based homopolymers  and  copolymers  such  as  polyethylene, polypropylene  and  polystyrene,   and  polyacrylate-based homopolymers  and  copolymers  such  as  polymethacrylate  and polymethyl  methacrylate.    Styrene  copolymers  such  as acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and<br><br>
acrylonitrile-butylene-styrene copolymer may also be used. Out  of  these,   styrene  homopolymers  and  copolymers  are preferred.<br>
The  above  expression  (2)   for  the  copolymer  (E) represents  the  ratio  of  the  surface  tension  of  the thermoplastic  resin  to  the  surface  tension  of  the  polymer segment (e2).    That is,  it shows the parameter of interfacial surface  energy  between  the  polymer  segment   (e2)   and  the thermoplastic  resin.    When  this  ratio  is  smaller  than  0.7 or larger than  1.3,  interfacial tension between the polymer segment  (e2)   and  the  thermoplastic  resin  becomes  high  and therefore,   interfacial  adhesion  between  the  two  phases becomes  unsatisfactory.    The  ratio  of  the  surface  tension of  the  thermoplastic  resin  to  the  surface  tension  of  the polymer  segment   (e2)   is  preferably  0.75  to  1.25,  more preferably  0.8  to  1.2.    The  polymer  segment   (e2)   is  not particularly  limited  if  it  satisfies  the  above  expression (2).    Preferred examples of the polymer segment  (e2)  include polyolefin-based  homopolymers  and  copolymers  such  as polyethylene,  polypropylene  and  polystyrene,   and polyacrylate-based  homopolymers  and  copolymers  such  as polymethacrylate  and  polymethyl  methacrylate.    Copolymers such  as  acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and acrylonitrile-butylene-styrene copolymer may also be used. Out  of  these,   ethylene  homopolymers  and  copolymers  are preferred.<br>
The above copolymer (E) may be a graft copolymer or block copolymer. As for the preferred ratio of the polymer segment (el) and the polymer segment (e2), the amount of the polymer segment (el) is 10 to 90 wt% and the amount of the polymer segment (e2) is 90 to 10 wt%. Examples of the copolymer of such two different polymer segments include a copolymer of polyethylene and polystyrene, copolymer of polypropylene  and  polystyrene,   copolymer  of  an<br><br>
ethylene-glycidyl  methacrylate  copolymer  and  polystyrene, copolymer  of  an  ethylene-ethyl  acrylate  copolymer  and polystyrene,   copolymer  of  an  ethylene-vinyl  acetate copolymer  and  polystyrene,   copolymer  of  polyethylene  and polymethyl methacrylate,  copolymer of an ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate  copolymer  and  polymethyl  methacrylate, copolymer  of  an  ethylene-ethyl  acrylate  copolymer  and polymethyl  methacrylate,   copolymer  of  an  ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer and polymethyl methacrylate,  copolymer of an  acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and  polyethylene, copolymer  of  an  acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and polypropylene,   copolymer  of  an  acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer and an ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer, copolymer  of  an  acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and  an ethylene-ethyl  acrylate  copolymer,   and  copolymer  of  an acrylonitrile-styrene  copolymer  and  an  ethylene-vinyl acetate  copolymer.<br>
Further,   the  above  expression   (3)   for  the  above homopolymer  (F)  can be understood likewise when the polymer segment  (el)  in  the  above  expression  (1)  is  substituted by the   homopolymer  (F).    The  above  expression  (4)  can also be understood  likewise  when  the  polymer  segment   (e2)   in  the above expression  (2)  is  substituted by the homopolymer  (F) . Examples  of  the  homopolymer  (F)   include  polyolefin-based homopolymers  such  as  polyethylene,  polypropylene  and polystyrene;   and  polyacrylate-based  homopolymers  such  as polymethacrylate  and  polymethyl  methacrylate.<br>
The  amount  of  the  above  compatibilizing  agent  is preferably 0.001 to 40 parts by weight, more preferably 0.001 to  20  parts  by  weight  based  on  100  parts  by  weight  of  the thermoplastic  resin.<br>
The dispersion diameter of the carbon precursor into the thermoplastic resin in the thus formed mixture used in the  step   (1)   is  preferably  0.01  to  50  [xm.    The  carbon<br><br>
precursor in the mixture forms an island phase and becomes spherical or oval. The term "dispersion diameter" as used herein means the diameter of the spherical carbon precursor or the diameter of the long axis of the oval carbon precursor in  the  mixture.<br>
When  the  dispersion  diameter  of  the  carbon precursor into  the  thermoplastic  resin  is  outside  the  range  of  0.01 to  50 \xni,  it  is  difficult  to  produce  a  carbon  fiber  filler for  use  in  high-performance  composite  materials.    The dispersion  diameter  of  the  carbon  precursor  is  more<br>
preferably in the range of 0.01 to 30 \xm. Even after the mixture of the thermoplastic resin and the carbon precursor is heated at 300* C for 3 minutes, the dispersion diameter of the carbon precursor into the thermoplastic resin is preferably 0.01 to 50 \im. When the mixture obtained by melt kneading the thermoplastic resin with the carbon precursor is kept molten, the carbon precursor agglomerates along the passage  of  time.    When  the  dispersion  diameter  exceeds  50<br>
\xm. due  to  the  agglomeration  of  the  carbon  precursor,  it  is difficult  to  produce  a  carbon  fiber  filler  for  use  in high-performance  composite  materials  disadvantageously. As for the agglomeration speed of the carbon precursor which changes  according  to  the  types  of  the  thermoplastic  resin and  the  carbon  precursor  in  use,   the  carbon  precursor desirably  keeps  a  dispersion  diameter  of  0.01  to  50  \iia preferably  for  5  minutes  at  300"C,  more  preferably  for  10 minutes  or  more  at  300"C.<br>
In  the  step  (1),   the  above  mixture  is  spun  into  a precursor  fiber  or  formed  into  a  precursor  film.<br>
To  form  the  precursor  fiber,  the mixture  obtained by melt  kneading  is  melt  spun  from  a  spinning  nozzle.    The spinning temperature for melt  spinning is,  for example,  100 to  400°C,  preferably  150  to  400*0,  more  preferably  180  to 350°C.    The  spun  yarn  take-up  rate  is  preferably  10  m/min<br><br>
to 2,000 m/min. When the spun yarn take-up rate is outside the above range, a desired fibrous molded article (precursor fiber) of the mixture may not be obtained disadvantageously. In order to melt knead and then melt spin the mixture from the spinning nozzle, after it is melt kneaded, it is preferably supplied by a pipe while it is molten and melt spun from the spinning nozzle. The transfer time from melt kneading to delivery from the spinning nozzle is preferably 10  minutes  or  less.<br>
The  sectional  form  of  the  precursor  fiber  may  be circular  or other form,  and the circle-equivalent  diameter<br>
thereof  is  preferably  1  to  100  jun.<br>
Methods for forming the precursor film include one in which the mixture is sandwiched between two plates and one of the plates is turned to form a sheared film, one in which stress is quickly applied to the mixture by a compression press to form a sheared film, and one in which a rotary roller is used to form a sheared film. The shear is in the range of 1 to 100,000 S"‘. The formation of the precursor film may be carried out by melt extruding the mixture from a slit. The melt  extrusion  temperature  is  preferably  100  to  400*0.<br>
The precursor fiber or the precursor film in which the carbon precursor is  elongated may be produced by stretching a  fiber-like  or  film-like  molded  article  in  a molten  state or  softened  state.    These  treatments  are  carried  out preferably at  150  to  400" C,  more preferably at  180  to 350° C.<br>
The thickness of the precursor film is preferably 1 to 500 \im. When the thickness is larger than 500 \xia, gas permeability greatly deteriorates in the following step (2) for contacting the precursor film to oxygen and/or gas containing iodine gas to obtain a stabilized precursor film, whereby it takes long to obtain the stabilized precursor film.<br>
When the thickness  is  smaller than 1  ‘im,  the handling of the precursor  film  becomes  difficult  disadvantageously.<br><br>
According  to  the  present  invention,  in  the  step  (1), there is provided a composition for producing fibrous carbon, which  comprises  100  parts  by  weight  of  the  thermoplastic resin  and  1  to  150  parts  by  weight  of  at  least  one thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  selected  from  the  group consisting  of  pitch,   acrylonitrile,   polycarbodiimide, polyimide,  polybenzazole  and  aramide  as  described  above.<br>
The above composition may further contain one or more of a copolymer (E) of a polymer segment (el) which satisfies the above expression (1) and a polymer segment (e2) which satisfies the above expression (2) and a homopolymer (F) which satisfies the above expressions (3) and (4) in an amount of  0.001  to  20  parts  by  weight.<br>
The composition is substantially composed of 100 parts by weight  of  the  thermoplastic  resin  and  1  to  150  parts  by weight  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  or  may  be substantially  composed  of  100  parts  by  weight  of  the thermoplastic  resin,   1  to  150  parts  by  weight  of  the thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  and  0.001  to  20  parts  by weight of the above copolymer (E) and/or the homopolymer (F) .<br>
Preferably, (i) the thermoplastic carbon precursor is dispersed in the thermoplastic resin matrix in a particulate form and the average equivalent particle diameter of the dispersed thermoplastic carbon precursor is in the range of 0.01 to 50 \jtm, (ii) after the composition is heated at 300"C for 3 minutes, the average equivalent particle diameter of the dispersed thermoplastic carbon precursor is in the range of 0.01 to 50 \im, or (iii) the composition is prepared by mixing the thermoplastic resin with the thermoplastic carbon precursor at a temperature at which the melt viscosity of the thermoplastic resin is 0.5 to 30 times higher than the melt viscosity of the thermoplastic carbon precursor at a shear  rate  of  1,000  S"‘.<br>
In  the  following  step  (2)   of  the  present  invention.<br><br>
the precursor fiber or film is  subjected to a stabilization treatment  to  stabilize  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor contained  in  the  precursor  fiber  or  film  so  as  to  form  a stabilized  precursor  fiber  or  film.<br>
The  stabilization  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor is  a necessary step for obtaining a carbonized or graphitized fine carbon fiber.    When the thermoplastic resin and the copolymer are removed without carrying out this step, the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor thermally decomposes  or fuses.    For  stabilization,   a  known  treatment  such  as  a treatment  with  a  gas  stream  such  as  oxygen  or  a  solution treatment  with  an  acid  aqueous  solution  may  be  used.    From the viewpoint of productivity,  stabilization by a treatment with a gas  stream  (infusibilization)  is preferred.    The gas component  in  use  is  preferably  oxygen  and/or  mixed  gas containing halogen  gas  from the viewpoints  of  permeability into  the  above  thermoplastic  resin  and  adsorption  to  the thermoplastic carbon precursor and to make the thermoplastic carbon  precursor  infusible  quickly  at  a  low  temperature. Examples  of  the  halogen  gas  include  fluorine  gas,  chlorine gas,  bromine  gas  and iodine  gas.    Out  of  these,  bromine  gas and  iodine  gas  are  particularly  preferred.    For infusibilization in a gas stream,  the precursor fiber or film is  treated  in  a  desired  gas  atmosphere  preferably  at  50  to 350° C,  more  preferably  at  80  to  300° C  for  5  hours  or  less, preferably  2  hours  or  less.    The  softening  point  of  the thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  contained  in  the  precursor fiber  or  film  is  sharply  elevated  by  the  above infusibilization but  it  is  preferably 400° C or higher,  more preferably  500° C  or  higher  to  obtain  a  desired  fine  carbon fiber.<br>
In  the  following  step  (3)   of  the  present  invention, a  fibrous  carbon  precursor  is  formed  by  removing  the thermoplastic  resin  from the  stabilized  precursor  fiber  or<br><br>
film. The removal of the thermoplastic resin is carried out by thermal decomposition or dissolution in a solvent. VOxich one of the methods should be used depends on the type of the thermoplastic resin in use. For thermal decomposition which differs according to the thermoplastic resin in use, a temperature of preferably 400 to 600° C, more preferably 500 to 600"C in a gas atmosphere is used. The gas atmosphere may be an inert gas atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen, or an acid gas atmosphere containing oxygen. For dissolution in a solvent which differs according to the thermoplastic resin in use, a solvent having higher solubility is used. Preferred examples of the solvent include methylene chloride and tetrahydrofuran for a polycarbonate and decalin and toluene  for  polyethylene.<br>
In  the  final  step   (4)   of  the  present  invention,   the fibrous carbon precursor is carbonized or graphitized to form a carbon fiber.    The carbonization or graphitization of the fibrous carbon precursor may be carried out by a known method per se.    For example,  the fibrous carbon precursor is treated at  a  high  temperature  in  an  inert  gas  atmosphere  to  be carbonized  or  graphitized.    The  inert  gas  used  is  nitrogen or argon,  and the  temperature  is  preferably  500  to  3,500"C, more preferably 700 to 3,000" C,  particularly preferably 800 to  3,000°C.    The  amount  of  oxygen  for  carbonization  or graphitization is preferably 20 ppm or less, more preferably 10  ppm  or  less.    The  fiber  diameter  of  the  obtained  fine carbon  fiber  is  preferably  0.001  to  5  jun,  more  preferably 0.001  to  1  [im.<br>
A carbon fiber which has few branched structures and high strength and high elastic modulus can be produced by carrying  out  the  above  process.<br>
A  fine  carbon  fiber  having  a  fiber  diameter  of  0.001<br>
to  5 \xm,   for  example,   is  obtained  by  the  above  process.    A fine carbon fiber obtained from a composite fiber of phenolic<br><br>
resin  and  polyethylene  becomes  amorphous  and  inferior  in strength  and  elastic modulus  because  the  phenolic  resin  is amorphous.    However,   the  carbon  fiber  obtained  by  this process has higher strength and higher elastic modulus  than the  fine  carbon  fiber  obtained  from  a  composite  fiber  of phenolic  resin  and  polyethylene  as  the  molecular  chain  of the  carbon  fiber  is  aligned  excessively  in  the  axial direction  of  the  fiber.    Since  the  above  carbon  fiber  has fewer  branched  structures  than  a  carbon  fiber  obtained  by a vapor phase process,  a polymer can be reinforced by adding a  smaller amount  of  the  carbon  fiber  than  in  the prior  art.<br>
According to the present invention,  there is provided a  process  for manufacturing  a  carbon  fiber mat  which  is  an assembly of carbon fibers and not an independent carbon fiber by  further  improving  the  above  process  of  the  present invention.<br>
That is, the process for manufacturing a carbon fiber mat according to the present invention, comprises the steps of:<br>
(1)	melt  extruding  a  mixture  of  100  parts  by  weight  of  a thermoplastic resin and  1  to  150 parts  by weight  of at least    one  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  selected from the group consisting of pitch,  polyacrylonitrile, polycarbodiimide,   polyimide,  polybenzazole  and aramide  to  form  a  precursor  film;<br>
(2)	subjecting  the  precursor  film  to  a  stabilization treatment  to  stabilize  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor  contained  in  the  precursor  film  to  form  a stabilized  precursor  film;<br>
(3)	laminating  together  a  plurality  of  the  stabilized precursor  films  to  form  a  stabilized  precursor laminated  film;<br>
(4)	removing  the  thermoplastic  resin  from  the  stabilized precursor  laminated  film  to  form  a  fibrous  carbon<br><br>
precursor  mat; (5)     carbonizing  or  graphitizing  the  fibrous  carbon<br>
precursor  mat  to  form  a  carbon  fiber  mat. The above step (1)  is the same as the step (1) of forming a precursor  film  in  the  process  for manufacturing  a  carbon fiber.<br>
The step (2) is the same as the step (2) of forming a stabilized precursor film in the process for manufacturing a  carbon  fiber.<br>
In the step (3), a stabilized precursor laminated film is formed by laminating together a plurality of, for example, 2 to 1,000 stabilized precursor films obtained in the step (2).<br>
In  the  step   (4),   a  fibrous  carbon  precursor  mat  is formed  by  removing  the  thermoplastic  resin  from  the stabilized laminated film.    This step  (4)  can be carried out by  removing  the  thermoplastic  resin  in  the  same  manner  as in  the  step   (3)   of  the  process  for  manufacturing  a  carbon fiber.<br>
In  the  step  (5),  the  fibrous  carbon  precursor mat  is carbonized  or  graphitized  to  form  a  carbon  fiber mat.    The carbonization  or  graphitization  of  this  step   (5)   can  be carried out in the same manner as in the step (4) of the process for  manufacturing  a  carbon  fiber.<br>
According to the above process of the present invention, a  carbon  fiber  mat  made  of  fine  carbon  fibers  can  be manufactured extremely easily.    This carbon fiber mat is very useful  as  a high-function  filter  or electrode material  for batteries.<br>
Examples<br>
The following examples are provided for the purpose of further illustrating the present invention but are in no way  to  be  taken  as  limiting.<br><br>
The dispersion particle diameter of the thermoplastic carbon precursor in the thermoplastic resin and the fiber diameter of the precursor fiber were measured with the S-2400 scanning electron microscope (of Hitachi, Ltd.)" The strength and elastic modulus of the obtained carbon fiber were measured with the Tensilon RTC-1225A (of A &amp; D/Orientec Co., Ltd.). The surface tensions of the polymer segment (el), the polymer segment (e2), the thermoplastic carbon precursor and the thermoplastic resin were evaluated by using a reagent used in "Wet Tension Testing Method for Plastic Films and Sheets" specified in JIS K6768. The free voliome diameter of the thermoplastic resin was evaluated from the long-life component of a positron life spectrum by using a spherical model expression (Chem. Phys. 63, 51 (1981)) which gives a pore size and ‘‘NaaCoa as a positron line source. The melting point or glass transition temperature of the thermoplastic resin was measured with DSC2920 (of TA Instruments Co., Ltd.) at  a  temperature  elevation  rate  of  10°C/min,<br>
The softening point was measured with a micro-melting point measuring instrument. The melt viscosity (TIM) of the thermoplastic resin and the melt viscosity (T’A) of the thermoplastic carbon precursor at a shear rate at the time of melt kneading were evaluated by the dependence on shear rate of melt viscosity (Fig. 3). The shear rate (SR) at the time of melt kneading was evaluated by using the following equation   (3):<br>
(SR)   =   [2rt-D/(n/60)]/C	(3)<br>
wherein  D  is  the  outer  diameter   (m)   of  a  screw,   n  is  the revolution  (rpm)   of  the  screw,   and  C  is  a  clearance   (m).<br>
Example  1<br>
100 parts by weight of high-density polyethylene (of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a thermoplastic resin, 11.1 parts  of  the  AR-HP  meso-phase  pitch  (of  Mitsubishi  Gas<br><br>
Chemical Company, Inc.) as a thermoplastic carbon precursor and 0.56 part of the Modiper AllOO (graft copolymer of 70 wt% of low-density polyethylene and 30 wt% of polystyrene, manufactured by NOP Corporation) were melt kneaded together by a same-direction double-screw extruder (TEX-30 of The Japan Steel Works, Ltd., barrel temperature of 290°C, in a stream of nitrogen) to prepare a resin mixture. The shear rate (SR) of the resin mixture at the time of melt kneading was 628 s"‘. The ratio (TIM/I1A) of the melt viscosity (T]M) of the thermoplastic resin to the melt viscosity (T’A) of the thermoplastic carbon precursor at this shear rate was 1.2. The dispersion diameter of the thermoplastic carbon precursor  into  the  thermoplastic  resin  obtained  under  the<br>
above conditions was 0.05 to 2 fjim (see Fig. 1). When the particle size distribution of the AR-HP was evaluated with a scanning electron microscope,  particles having a diameter<br>
of less than 1 nm accounted for 90 % or more of the total (see Fig. 2) . When the resin composition was heated at 300° C for 10 minutes, the agglomeration of the thermoplastic carbon precursor  was  not  observed  and  the  dispersion  diameter<br>
thereof  was  0.05  to  2  }xm.    The  surface  tensions  of  the high-density polyethylene  (of Sumitomo Chemical Co. ,  Ltd.), low-density polyethylene  (of  Sumitomo Chemical  Co.,  Ltd.), meso-phase pitch and polystyrene were 31,  31,  22 and 24 mN/m, respectively,   the  value  obtained  from  (surface  tension  of polymer segment (el)/surface tension of thermoplastic carbon precursor)  was  1.1,   and  the  value  obtained  from  (surface tension  of  polymer  segment   (e2)/surface  tension  of thermoplastic  resin)  was  1.0.<br>
The above resin mixture was spun from a spinning nozzle at 300°C to form a precursor fiber (composite fiber). The fiber diameter of this composite fiber was 20 pun, and the dispersion diameter of the meso-phase pitch on the section was  all  2  jun or  less.    100  parts  by weight  of  the  composite<br><br>
fiber and 5 parts by weight  of iodine were fed to a pressure glass  container  and heated  at  100° C  for  10  hours  to  obtain a  stabilized  precursor  fiber.    This  stabilized  precursor fiber  was  gradually  heated  to  500° C    to  remove  the high-density  polyethylene  and  the  Modiper  AllOO. Thereafter,   the  fiber  was  heated  at  1,500°C  in  a  nitrogen atmosphere and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes to be carbonized.    The obtained fine carbon fiber had a fiber diameter of 0.01  to 2  [jm and a branched structure was rarely observed.    When the strength and elastic modulus of the fine<br>
carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of 1 fxm were measured, the fine carbon fiber had a tensile strength of 2,500 MPa and  an  elastic  modulus  in  tension  of  300  GPa.<br>

The  shear rate  (SR)  of  the resin mixture  at  the  time  of melt  kneading was  628  s"‘.    The  ratio  (TIM/TIA)  of  the melt  viscosity  (TIM)  of the  thermoplastic  resin  to  the  melt  viscosity  (TIA)   of  the thermoplastic  carbon precursor  at  this  shear  rate  was  1.2. The  dispersion  diameter  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor  into  the  thermoplastic  resin  obtained  under  the above  conditions  was  0.05  to  2 \iaa.    When  the  particle  size distribution  of  the  AR-HP  was  evaluated  by  a  scanning electron microscope, particles having a diameter of less than<br><br>
1 \ua accounted for 90  % or more of the total.    When the resin mixture was heated at 300° C for 10 minutes,  the agglomeration of  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor was  not  observed  and the dispersion diameter thereof was 0.05 to 2 pm.    The surface tensions  of  the  high-density  polyethylene   (of  Sumitomo Chemical Co.,  Ltd.),  low-density polyethylene  (of  Sumitomo Chemical  Co.,  Ltd.),  meso-phase  pitch and polystyrene  were 31,  31,  22 and 24 mN/m,  respectively,  the value obtained from (surface tension of polymer segment  (el)/surface tension of thermoplastic  carbon  precursor)  was  1.1,   and  the  value obtained  from  (surface  tension  of  polymer  segment (e2)/surface  tension  of  thermoplastic  resin)  was  1.0.<br>
The  above  resin  mixture  was  spun  from  the  spinning nozzle at 300° C to form a precursor fiber  (composite fiber) . The  fiber  diameter  of  this  composite  fiber  was  20  [im,   and the  dispersion  diameter  of  the  meso-phase  pitch  on  the section  was  all  2 ym or  less.    100  parts  by  weight  of  the composite  fiber and  5  parts by weight  of  iodine were  fed to a pressure glass  container and heated at  100° C for  10 hours to  obtain  a  stabilized  precursor  fiber.    This  stabilized precursor fiber was  gradually heated to  500° C to remove  the high-density  polyethylene  and  the  Modiper  AllOO. Thereafter,   the  fiber  was  heated  at  1,500°C  in  a  nitrogen atmosphere and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes to be carbonized.    The obtained fine carbon fiber had a fiber diameter of 0.01 to 2 \xm,  and a branched structure was rarely observed.    When the strength and elastic modulus of the fine carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of  1  pun were measured, the  fine  carbon  fiber  had  a  tensile  strength  of  2,500  MPa and  an  elastic  modulus  in  tension  of  300  GPa.<br>
Example  3<br>
100  parts  by  weight  of  poly-4-methylpentene-l   (TPX: grade RT-18  [of Mitsui Chemicals,  Inc.])  as  a thermoplastic<br><br>
resin  and  11.1  parts  of  the  AR-HP  meso-phase  pitch  (of Mitsubishi  Gas  Chemical  Company,   Inc.)  as  a  thermoplastic carbon  precursor  were  melt  kneaded  together  by  a same-direction  double-screw  extruder  (TEX-30  of  The  Japan Steel Works,  Ltd.,  barrel temperature  of  290"C,  in a stream of  nitrogen)   to  prepare  a  resin  mixture.    The  dispersion diameter  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon  precursor  into  the thermoplastic resin obtained under the above conditions was<br>
0.05 to 2 [Am.    When the resin mixture was heated at  300° C for 3  minutes,   the  agglomeration  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon precursor  was  not  observed  and  the  dispersion  diameter thereof  was  0.05  to  2  jim.    The  surface  tensions  of  the poly-4-methylpentene-l  and the meso-phase pitch were 24 and 22  mN/m,   respectively.    The  average  diameter  of  the  free volume  of  the  poly-4-methylpentene-l  evaluated  by  the positron  extinction  method  was  0.64  nm,   and  the  crystal melting  point  evaluated  by  DSC  thereof  was  238°C.<br>
The  above  resin  mixture  was  spun  from  the  spinning nozzle at 300° C to form a precursor fiber  (composite fiber). The  fiber  diameter  of  this  composite  fiber  was  20  [xm,   and the  dispersion  diameter  of  the  meso-phase  pitch  on  the section  was  all  2  nm  or  less.     100  parts  by  weight  of  the composite  fiber  and  10  parts  by  weight  of  iodine  were  fed to a pressure glass container and heated at  190° C for 2 hours to  obtain  a  stabilized  precursor  fiber.    This  stabilized precursor fiber was  gradually heated to 500° C to remove the poly-4-methylpentene-l.    Thereafter,   the  fiber  was  heated at  1,500°C  in  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  and maintained  at  that temperature  for  30  minutes  to  be  carbonized.    The  obtained fine  carbon  fiber  had  a  fiber  diameter  of  0.01  to  2  |xm  and a branched structure was rarely observed.    When the strength and elastic modulus  of  the  fine carbon fiber having a fiber<br>
diameter  of  1  jxm  were  measured,   the  fine  carbon  fiber  had a  tensile  strength  of  2,500  MPa  and  an  elastic  modulus  in<br><br>
tension  of  300  GPa.<br>
Example  4<br>
100 parts by weight of high-density polyethylene (of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a thermoplastic resin and 11.1 parts of the AR-HP meso-phase pitch (of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.) as a thermoplastic carbon precursor were melt kneaded together by a double-screw extruder (TEX-30 of The Japan Steel Works, Ltd. , L/D = 42, barrel temperature of 290° C, in a stream of nitrogen) to prepare a resin mixture. The  dispersion  dieimeter  of  the  thermoplastic  carbon<br>
precursor into the thermoplastic resin was 0.1 to 10 jim. When the resin mixture was heated at 300°C for 10 minutes, the agglomeration of the thermoplastic carbon precursor was not observed  and  the  dispersion  diameter  thereof  was  0.1  to  10<br>
\xm. The above resin mixture was sandwiched between quartz plates heated at 300"C and sheared at 750 s"‘ for 1 minute with a heating shear and flow observation device (CSS-450A of Japan Hi-tech Co., Ltd.) and quenched to room temperature to form a 60 fAm-thick film. When the thermoplastic carbon precursor contained in the film was observed by the above device, it was confirmed that a fiber having a diameter of 0.01 to 5 jun and a length of 1 to 20 pim was formed. Thereafter, 100 parts by weight of this film and 5 parts by weight of iodine were fed to a pressure glass container and heated at 100°C for 10 hours to obtain a stabilized precursor film. This stabilized precursor film was gradually heated to 500° C to remove the high-density polyethylene. Thereafter, the film was heated at 1,500°C in a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes to carbonize the AR-HP. The obtained fine carbon fiber had a fiber diameter of 0.01 to 5 [xm, and a branched structure was rarely observed.<br><br>
Example  5<br>
100 parts by weight of high-density polyethylene (of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a thermoplastic resin and 11.1 parts of the AR-HP meso-phase pitch (of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.) as a thermoplastic carbon precursor were melt kneaded together by a double-screw extruder (TEX-30 of The Japan Steel Works, Ltd., L/D = 42, barrel temperature of 290" C, in a stream of nitrogen) to prepare a resin mixture. The dispersion diameter of the thermoplastic carbon precursor into the thermoplastic resin was 0.1 to 10 [un. When the resin mixture was heated at 300" C for 10 minutes, the agglomeration of the thermoplastic carbon precursor was not observed and the dispersion diameter thereof was 0.1 to 10 fAm. The melt viscosity of the thermoplastic resin at 300" C and a shear rate of 1,000 s"‘ was 10 times higher than that of  the  AR-HP  meso-phase  pitch.<br>
The  above  resin  mixture  was  spun  from  the  spinning nozzle at  300* C to form a precursor fiber  (composite fiber) .<br>
The  fiber  diameter  of  this  composite  fiber  was  20  jAm,   and the dispersion diameter of  the AR-HP  on the  section was  all<br>
10  [xm  or  less.    100  parts  by weight  of  the  composite  fiber and 5  parts by weight of iodine were fed to a pressure glass container  and  heated  at  100° C  for  10  hours  to  obtain  a stabilized  precursor  fiber.    This  stabilized  precursor fiber  was  gradually  heated  to  500° C  to  remove  the high-density  polyethylene.    Thereafter,   the  fiber  was heated  at  1,500""C  in  a  nitrogen  atmosphere  and  maintained at  that  temperature  for  30  minutes  to  carbonize  the  AR-HP. The obtained fine carbon fiber had a  fiber diameter of  0.01 to 5 jun,  and a branched structure was rarely observed.    When the  strength  and  elastic  modulus  of  the  fine  carbon  fiber having a fiber diameter of 1 pun were measured,  the fine carbon fiber  had  a  tensile  strength  of  2,500  MPa  and  an  elastic modulus  in  tension  of  300  GPa.<br><br>
Example  6<br>
100 parts by weight of high-density polyethylene (of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) as a thermoplastic resin and 10 parts by weight of the AR-HP meso-phase pitch (of Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.) as a thermoplastic carbon precursor were melt kneaded together by a double-screw extruder (TEX-30 of The Japan Steel Works, Ltd., L/D = 42, barrel temperature of 290°C, in a stream of nitrogen), and the obtained resin mixture was supplied by a gear pump in a molten state and spun from the spinning nozzle to obtain a precursor fiber. The precursor fiber had a fiber dieimeter of 20 jun, and the dispersion diameter of the AR-HP on the section  was  all  10  (xm  or  less.<br>
100 parts by weight of this precursor fiber and 5 parts by weight of iodine were fed to a pressure glass container and heated at 100"C for 10 hours. The high-density polyethylene contained in the obtained stabilized precursor fiber was removed with hot toluene as a solvent. When the softening point of the AR-HP was measured, it was 500°C or higher.<br>
This stabilized precursor fiber was gradually heated to 500°C to remove the high-density polyethylene. Thereafter, the fiber was heated at 1,500°C in a nitrogen atmosphere and maintained at that temperature for 30 minutes to carbonize the AR-HP. The obtained fine carbon fiber had a fiber diameter of 0.01 to 5 \)im. The carbon fiber targeted by the present invention could be thus obtained. The strength and elastic modulus of the fine carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of 1 f’un were measured. The results are shown in  Table  1.<br>
Comparative  Example  1<br>
100 parts by weight of phenolic resin as a thermoplastic<br><br>
carbon precursor and 100 parts by weight of high-density polyethylene were melt kneaded together by a double-screw extruder, and the obtained resin mixture was supplied by a gear pump in a molten state and spun from the spinning nozzle to obtain a precursor fiber. The obtained precursor fiber was immersed in an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid and formaldehyde (18 wt% of hydrochloride acid, 10 wt% of formaldehyde) to obtain a stabilized precursor fiber. This fiber was carbonized at 600° C for 10 minutes in a stream of nitrogen to remove the polyethylene so as to obtain a phenolic fine carbon fiber.    The  strength and elastic modulus of  the<br>
fine carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of 1 jun were measured. The  results  are  shown  in  Table  1.<br>
Comparative  Example  2<br>
A fiber made of the AR-HP alone was obtained by spinning only  the  AR-HP  in  accordance  with  the  same  method  as  the spinning method  for  obtaining  a precursor  fiber  in  Example 6.<br>
Stabilization  and  graphitization  were  carried  out under the same conditions as  in Example 6  to obtain a carbon fiber having a fiber diameter of 15 |am.    The results are shown in  Table  1.<br><br><br><br>
