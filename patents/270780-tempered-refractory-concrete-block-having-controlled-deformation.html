				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an unmolded refractory concrete, to a molded concrete<br>
and to a prefabricated or finished refractory block which can be obtained from that<br>
unmolded concrete, and to their utilization for manufacturing metallurgical furnace linings<br>
and in particular linings of blast furnace crucibles or tuyeres.<br>
Refractory concretes normally consist of a mixture of an aggregate and a<br>
hydraulic binder based on alkaline earth oxides, in particular based on aluminate of lime.<br>
This latter binder is generally called "cement". However, the presence of alkaline earth<br>
oxides in these concretes, referred to as "castable" in English, is prejudicial to the<br>
refractory properties and increases the deformation under load.<br>
Moreover, these oxides react in a reducing medium.<br>
Thus, the refractory concretes described in EP 0 839 775, which exhibit an<br>
essentially zero content of lime (CaO) but contain at least 1% of fine particles of magnesia<br>
(MgO), are not suitable for blast furnace crucibles where the atmosphere is rich in carbon<br>
monoxide (CO).<br>
EP 0 030 181 describes concretes exhibiting a low content of alkaline earth<br>
oxides. These concretes thus exhibit good resistance to corrosion and oxidation. However,<br>
their deformation under load proves difficult to control.<br>
In general, linings based on refractory concretes with a low content of alkaline<br>
earth oxides, and even more so refractory concretes with no alkaline earth oxides, are well<br>
known to develop internal cracks when they are subjected to the temperature gradients and<br>
variations under the corrosive conditions of a blast furnace. These cracks favor erosion<br>
and thus limit the lifetime of these linings.<br>
The use of carbon-containing blocks for building the linings of blast furnaces<br>
is also known. These blocks are normally obtained by molding of a paste bound with resin<br>
or pitch, then firing at a temperature greater than 1200°C. The product is thus calcined<br>
and the organic binders pyrolyzed. However, carbon-containing blocks exhibit poor<br>
resistance to oxidation and to corrosion by the molten iron and erosion resistance which is<br>
all the weaker because they contain high proportions of carbon in the form of graphite.<br>
There is thus a need for a refractory concrete capable of solving, at least<br>
partially, one or more of the aforesaid problems.<br><br>
One purpose of the invention is to satisfy that need.<br>
In a first main implementation mode of a concrete according to the invention,<br>
this purpose is attained by means of a molded refractory concrete comprising a refractory<br>
aggregate bound by a binding matrix, the matrix representing between 10 and 60% by<br>
weight of the concrete and exhibiting a composition, in percentages by weight based on<br>
the matrix, such as:<br>
-	Al2O3 + SiO2 &gt; 70%<br>
-	50%&gt;SiO2&gt;10%<br>
alkaline earth oxides: ≤ 0.2%.<br>
As will appear more clearly in the rest of the description, this composition<br>
surprisingly makes it possible to obtain excellent resistance to corrosion, in spite of a low<br>
content of alkaline earth oxides, particularly in case of use in a lining of a blast furnace<br>
crucible, and essentially linear deformability under load.<br>

all.<br>
-	The matrix exhibits a content of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) and/or of zirconia (ZrO2) less<br>

In a second main implementation mode of a concrete according to the<br>
invention, the invention also relates to a molded refractory concrete containing a refractory<br>
aggregate bound by a binding matrix, the matrix representing between 10 and 60% by<br>
weight of the concrete and exhibiting a composition, in percentages by weight based on<br>
the matrix, such as:<br>

alkaline earth oxides: ≤ 0.2%,<br>
the matrix containing more than 1% and less than 20% of hydratable or high moisture<br>

In a third main implementation mode of the concrete according to the<br>

-	50%&gt;SiO2&gt; 10%<br>
hydratable or high moisture uptake Al2O3: &gt; 1%<br>
alkaline earth oxides: 
This concrete can in particular contain at least 0.5% by weight of SiC. The<br>
hydratable alumina can in particular be of the kni-Al2O3 and/or rho-Al2O3 crystallographic<br>
type.<br>
A concrete according to the second main implementation mode or according to<br>
the third main implementation mode can also have one or more of the optional or<br>
necessary characteristics of a concrete according to the first main implementation mode, to<br>
the extent that these characteristics are not incompatible with these second or third main<br>
implementation modes.<br>
In the rest of the description, a concrete which is molded and according to any<br>
one of the three main implementation modes described above is called a "molded concrete<br>
according to the invention".<br>
The invention also relates to an unmolded concrete, in the dry or moist state,<br>
capable of solidification to constitute a molded concrete according to the invention or a<br>
block at least in part made up of such a concrete. "Capable of solidification" is understood<br>
to mean that the composition of the concrete enables it to harden by simple activation,<br>
preferably with no other prospective addition than addition of water.<br>
The unmolded concrete according to the invention can be poured on the spot to<br>
create a lining. In that case, it can be delivered in the dry or moist state, ready for use, for<br>
example packed either in big bags in the dry state, or in drums in the moist state.<br>
Alternatively, the concrete can be made into the shape of a finished or prefabricated block,<br>
which will be assembled on site.<br>
The invention thus also relates, in a first main implementation mode of a<br>
block, to a refractory block at least one part whereof, preferably the whole, is made up of a<br>
refractory concrete according to the invention.<br><br>
Preferably, the block according to the invention also exhibits one, and<br>
preferably several, of the following optional characteristics:<br>
-	The block exhibits a weight of more than 50 kg, preferably of more than 300 kg and/or<br>
less than 2 tonnes. Preferably, it exhibits a weight of about 1 tonne.<br>
-	The block is a prefabricated product.<br>
-	After the preforming stage, the block has undergone no heat treatment other than<br>
tempering at a temperature lying between 400 and 600°C.<br>
The invention also relates to a finished block having preferably undergone<br>
firing at a temperature lying between 1300°C and 1500°C.<br>
The invention also relates, in a second main implementation mode of a block,<br>
to a refractory block exhibiting a weight of more than 50 kg and at least one part whereof<br>
is made up of a molded refractory finished or prefabricated concrete, containing a<br>
refractory aggregate bound in a binding matrix, the matrix representing between 10% and<br>
60% by weight of concrete and exhibiting a composition, in percentages by weight based<br>
on the matrix, such as:<br>
-	Al2O3 + SiO2 &gt; 70%<br>
-	50%&gt;SiO2&gt;10%<br>
alkaline earth oxides: 
This refractory block can have undergone tempering at a temperature greater<br>
than 400°C. It can contain at least 0.5% by weight of silicon carbide and/or more than 1%<br>
of hydratable alumina, and in particular of hydratable alumina of khi-Al2O3 and/or rho-<br>
Al2O3 crystallographic type or of high moisture uptake alumina.<br>
A refractory block according to a second main implementation mode can also<br>
have one or more of the characteristics of a block according to the first main<br>
implementation mode of a block, to the extent that these characteristics are not<br>
incompatible with that second main implementation mode.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for fabrication of a prefabricated<br>
refractory block according to the invention comprising the following steps:<br>
a) preparation of a starting charge;<br><br>
b)	pouring of the starting charge into a mold and, preferably, vibration of the<br>
starting charge in that mold;<br>
c)	drying and hardening so as to obtain a preform,<br>
d)	tempering of the preform, preferably at a temperature lying between 400°C<br>
and 800°C, or indeed between 400°C and 600 C, so as to obtain a<br>
prefabricated block,<br>
the starting charge being determined such that at the end of step d), the prefabricated block<br>
is according to the invention.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to the utilization of a refractory concrete<br>
according to the invention or of a refractory block manufactured or capable of being<br>
manufactured by a process according to the invention in a lining of a furnace, in particular<br>
of a metallurgical furnace, or in a lining of a blast furnace, in particular in a lining of a<br>
crucible and/or of a tuyere of a blast furnace.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all the percentages relating to the composition of the<br>
molded or unmolded, dry or moist concrete, or relating to the starting charge, are<br>
percentages by weight expressed relative to the weight of the dry mineral matter, including<br>
the possible silicon carbide.<br>
A dry or moist particulate mixture capable of solidification so as to constitute a<br>
molded concrete is called "unmolded concrete".<br>
A dry and solid material, the microstructure whereof is made up of an<br>
aggregate the grains whereof are held together by means of a matrix is called "molded<br>
concrete". A molded concrete can be of any shape. The molded concrete can in particular<br>
exhibit the shape of a block or of a layer, for example when it results from the<br>
solidification of an intended lining. Usually, the molded concrete is obtained by<br>
solidification of a particulate mixture which has undergone an activation step, generally by<br>
moistening with water.<br>
One or more subsequent heat treatments (tempering, firing) can improve the<br>
mechanical strength of the "molded concrete".<br>
A molded concrete is described as "prefabricated" when its microstructure is<br>
temporary. Otherwise, it is described as "finished". In the present invention, the<br>
microstructure of a prefabricated concrete of a lining of a reactor (furnace, blast furnace,<br><br>
...) will thus develop further after installation of the concrete, under the action of a high<br>
operating temperature, typically of the order of 1300 to 1600°C, resulting from the firing<br>
up of that reactor.<br>
A collection of refractory grains at least 90% whereof by weight have a size<br>
lying between 150 um and 15 mm is called an "aggregate". The nature of the aggregate in<br>
the concrete according to the invention is not limiting.<br>
"Matrix" is understood to mean crystalline or non-crystalline phase, providing<br>
a continuous structure between the grains and obtained, during solidification, from the<br>
constituents of the starting charge.<br>
"Impurities" is understood to mean the unavoidable constituents necessarily<br>
introduced with the starting materials or resulting from reactions with these constituents.<br>
Impurities are not necessary constituents, but are merely tolerated.<br>
"Silica in micronic form" is understood to mean a silica powder the particles<br>
whereof, partially amorphous, have a median diameter lying between 0.01 and 4 (am.<br>
Silica in colloidal form exhibits a median particle diameter which can be lower, generally<br>
of the order of a few nanometers.<br>
An alumina of the khi-Al2O3 or rho-Al2O3 crystallographic type obtained by<br>
flash calcination of hydrargilite gamma-Al(OH)3 is called "hydratable alumina". The<br>
hydratable aluminas are said to be "transitional" and have the property of hydrating in the<br>
presence of water (liquid or vapor).<br>
The transitional aluminas include the hydratable aluminas but are not limited<br>
to them. In particular, they include aluminas of the gamma and beta type.<br>
Reactive aluminas are aluminas which are calcined and usually ground so as to<br>
exhibit a median diameter of less than 10 µm. They are generally essentially in the alpha<br>
crystallographic form.<br>
The "moisture uptake" is measured by placing a sample, for example 100 g of<br>
alumina previously dried at 100°C and for a drying period of 5 hours, in a sealed enclosure<br>
saturated to 100% humidity at ambient temperature (20°C), at atmospheric pressure. The<br>
increase in the weight of the sample ("moisture uptake") until saturation, that is to say<br>
until stabilization of the weight, is then measured. The moisture uptake is stated as<br>
percentage by weight relative to the dry starting weight.<br><br>
Finally, elongated structures, typically of diameter from 0.1 µm to 2 mm and<br>
of length ranging up to about 3 cm are called "fibers".<br>
In a molded material, the average of the largest dimension of a particle or a<br>
grain and its smallest dimension, these dimensions being measured on a cross-section of<br>
the said material, is called the "size" of the particle or grain.<br>
A heat treatment of a moist mixture, preferably previously dried, at a<br>
temperature lying between 400 and 600°C is called "tempering".<br>
Zirconium oxide ZrO2 is called "zirconia".<br>
Aluminum oxide Al2O3 is called "alumina".<br>
Silicon oxide SiO2 is called "silica".<br>
To manufacture a molded refractory concrete according to the invention, the<br>
steps described above can be followed.<br>
In step a), the particulate materials are usually mixed until a homogenous<br>
mixture is obtained.<br>
The nature and the quantities of starting materials are determined in such a<br>
manner that the refractory concrete obtained at the end of step d) is according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The method of determining the proportions of the constituents of the starting<br>
charge is perfectly well known to the person skilled in the art. In particular, the person<br>
skilled in the art knows that the oxides of aluminum and of silicon and any silicon carbide<br>
present in the starting charge are also present in the molded concrete. He also knows how<br>
to determine which constituents will be transformed to constitute the matrix.<br>
Certain oxides can however be provided by the additives normally used to<br>
manufacture concretes, for example sintering agents, dispersants such as alkali metal<br>
polyphosphates or methacrylate derivatives. The composition of the starting charge can<br>
therefore vary, particularly depending on the quantities and the nature of the additives<br>
present, and the purity level of the starting materials used.<br>
Preferably, the starting charge is determined in order that silicon carbide,<br>
alumina and silica represent at least 80%, preferably at least 95% of the dry inorganic<br>
weight of the molded concrete.<br><br>
The aggregate can be made up of grains based on refractory oxides or non-<br>
oxide refractories, such as for example carbon, in particular anthracite or graphite, or for<br>
example carbides such as silicon carbide (SiC). In particular, the grains can be grains of<br>
alumina, zirconia, zircon, silicon carbide or silicon nitride, of a mixture of these latter, or<br>
indeed spherical granulated refractory particles.<br>
The silica can be provided in the form of micronic silica (for example in the<br>
form of silica fume or micronised silica) or colloidal silica.<br>
The matrix exhibits as low as possible a content of CaO and/or MgO, for<br>
example less than 0.15%, or indeed less than 0.1%. The content of CaO and/or MgO can<br>
even be reduced to less than 0.05%.<br>
Preferably, however, the content of zirconia (ZrO2) capable of constituting the<br>
matrix is limited such that, in the matrix, it is less than 2%, preferably than 1%, more<br>
preferably less than 0.5%. The presence of zirconia in fact leads to carbides or nitrides<br>
under the ambient conditions of a blast furnace.<br>
The chromium oxide (Cr2O3) content of the matrix is also limited such as to<br>
be, preferably, less than 0.5%, preferably less than 0.2%, in percentage by weight based on<br>
the matrix, more preferably essentially zero. In fact, under industrial conditions, chromium<br>
oxide leads to very stringent constraints as regards hygiene, safety and the environment.<br>
It is also useful to limit the content of alkali metal oxides such that the total<br>
quantity thereof in the molded concrete is less than 1% relative to the inorganic weight of<br>
the dry molded concrete. Advantageously, in this way latent swelling associated with the<br>
formation of phases made up of alumina Al2O3, silica SiO2 and alkali metal oxides (K2O,<br>
Na2()) of the leucite or kaliophyllite type is avoided.<br>
Preferably, the oxides of chromium, zirconium, calcium, magnesium and alkali<br>
metals are only introduced into the starting charge as impurities.<br>
Preferably, the base mixture contains between 0.1% and 2%, preferably less<br>
than 0.5% of a dispersant, as percentages by weight relative to the weight of the dry<br>
starting charge. The dispersant can for example be selected from the polyphosphates of<br>
alkali metals or the methacrylate derivatives. All known dispersants can be envisaged,<br>
pure ionic, for example sodium hexametaphosphate (HMPNa), pure steric. for example of<br>
the sodium polymethacrylate type, or in combination. The addition of a dispersant makes<br><br>
it possible to distribute the fine particles, of size less than 150 microns, better and thus<br>
benefits the mechanical strength of the matrix.<br>
Preferably, the starting charge also contains between 0.01% and 0.1% of<br>
organic fibers of the vinylic or polypropylene type, as percentages by weight based on the<br>
dry starting charge. These fibers advantageously facilitate the removal of water during<br>
drying.<br>
In order further to improve the fracture resistance during use, the starting<br>
charge can also contain metallic or ceramic fibers, the content by weight of these fibers in<br>
the starting charge preferably lying between 0.01 and 5%, as percentages by weight based<br>
on the dry starting charge.<br>
The dry starting charge constitutes an unmolded concrete according to the<br>
invention, which can be packed and delivered in this form.<br>
After dry mixing sufficiently to obtain a homogenous mixture, water is<br>
normally added to the starting charge. Preferably, at least 2%, preferably at least 3% and<br>
less than 10%, preferably less than 6%, more preferably less than 5%. of water is added, in<br>
percentages by weight relative to the inorganic weight of the starting charge, excluding the<br>
water. The water is added progressively to the mixer while it is running until an essentially<br>
homogenous moist mixture is obtained. The addition of water causes the activation of the<br>
starting charge, that is to say starts its solidification process.<br>
The moist mixture constitutes an unmolded concrete according to the<br>
invention, which can be packed, for example in drums, and delivered in this form.<br>
In step b), the moist mixture is poured into a mold so as to obtain a block of<br>
the desired dimensions, for example 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 m3<br>
Preferably, at least one of the dimensions of the block is greater than 0.4 m,<br>
preferably than 0.6 m, preferably than 0.8 m.<br>
The utilization of large blocks advantageously makes it possible to reduce the<br>
number of joints compared to an assembly of refractory bricks. In this way, corrosive<br>
attack via the joints is limited.<br><br>
The utilization of large blocks also allows rapid installation of the refractory<br>
lining. The utilization of refractory blocks in fact avoids the need to carry out drying<br>
before installation of the lining.<br>
In order to improve the placing of the mixture in the mold, a vibrating pin like<br>
those utilized in civil engineering is normally used. The vibration of the pin within the<br>
moist mixture is preferably maintained for a period lying between 3 and 20 minutes,<br>
depending on the size of the block.<br>
At the end of the vibration step, the mold is preferably covered with a covering<br>
sheet in order to reduce surface drying<br>
In step c), the drying is performed so as to harden the moist mixture.<br>
To facilitate the hardening, the mold is preferably immediately placed in an<br>
oven, from the end of step b), preferably at a temperature lying between 40 and 70°C and<br>
for a period which is variable depending on the dimensions of the block, in general from a<br>
few minutes to 24 hours.<br>
After hardening, the preform can be removed from the mold.<br>
In step d), tempering is performed in order to eliminate the hydrates. This<br>
tempering is preferably effected in air, more preferably at a temperature greater than<br>
400°C, preferably greater than 450 C and, more preferably, less than 800°C, or indeed less<br>
than 600 C. The rate of temperature increase and the plateau duration at the maximum<br>
temperature are normally adapted depending on the dimensions of the block and the<br>
charge of the tempering furnace.<br>
The tempering period can be greater than 3 hours, greater than 10 hours, or<br>
indeed greater than 20 hours, or indeed greater than several days, depending on the weight<br>
of concrete to be tempered and on the tempering temperature.<br>
It is considered that the tempering is finished when essentially all the hydrates<br>
have been eliminated.<br>
Routine tests make it possible to determine the optimal tempering period.<br>
At the end of the tempering, the block is a prefabricated block according to the<br>
invention which advantageously exhibits a mechanical strength sufficient for it to be<br><br>
capable of manipulation, transport and assembly to form a lining of a furnace, tuyere or<br>
crucible.<br>
The prefabricated refractory block, after tempering and before firing,<br>
advantageously exhibits the following characteristics:<br>
remarkable corrosion resistance;<br>
a coefficient of free thermal expansion, in other words with no load, which varies<br>
essentially linearly under the action of an increase in the temperature between 20°C<br>
and 1600°C;<br>
a mean coefficient of free thermal expansion, between 20 and 800°C, C20-800, less than<br>
10.10-6/°C, corresponding to a free thermal expansion of less than 1.25% between the<br>
ambient temperature of 20°C and the temperature of 800°C;<br>
a ratio between the mean coefficient of free thermal expansion (C800-1500) between 800<br>
and 1500°C to that (C20-800) between 20 and 800°C lying between 0.7 and 1.3, or<br>
indeed between 0.8 and 1.2, and even lying between 0.9 and 1.1;<br>
remarkable performance under load, and in particular a mean coefficient of thermal<br>
expansion under a load of 2 bars lying between 2.10-6 and 9.10-6 /°C, corresponding to<br>
a thermal expansion under load lying between 0.3 and 1.4% between 20 and 1600°C;<br>
a thermal expansion such that, for any temperature T lying between 600 and 1600°C,<br>
L-20-600 ≤ L'20-T ≤ L'20-600 + 1,3 * L'20-600*(T - 600)/(600 - 20)<br>
where L'20-600 and L'20-T designate the thermal expansion values under a load of 2 bars<br>
between 20 and 600°C and between 20 and T°C, respectively;<br>
an open porosity of the finished concrete of less than 15%;<br>
a median pore diameter in the finished concrete less than 0.5 µm. or indeed less than<br>
0.1 µm;<br>
very low permeability, which improves the corrosion resistance. In particular, the<br>
permeability in air and at ambient temperature (20°C) can be less than 0,5 mDarcy<br>
(lmDarcy=0.987*10-l2m2).<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have found that the median pore diameter can be<br>
less than 0.05 urn, or indeed less than 0.02 µm. Advantageously, such pore diameters<br>
confer very good resistance to infiltration and hence good resistance to corrosion.<br>
Surprisingly, the inventors have also found that the specific surface area,<br>
normally measured by the B.E.T. method (this method, by adsorption of inert gas, was<br><br>
developed by S. Brunauer, P.H. Emmet and J. Teller and is well known to the person<br>
skilled in the art) can be greater than 2 m2/g, greater than 2.5 m2/g, or indeed greater than<br>
4m2 /g or than 5 m2 /g. The specific surface area can vary depending on the quantity of<br>
matrix.<br>
These median pore diameter and specific surface area values are particularly<br>
high, conventional concretes typically exhibiting a median pore diameter of the order of<br>
0.1 to lum and a specific surface area of the order of 1 m2/g.<br>
The thermal expansion, expressed as a percentage, corresponds to the<br>
elongation (if change positive) or contraction (if change negative) of a test piece under the<br>
action of the increase in the temperature, in the sense of the standard NFB40308 in the<br>
absence of load or of the standard ISO1893 in the case of the application of a load, the<br>
state "(T being the starting state of the test piece before the application of heat.<br>
The coefficient of thermal expansion represents the change in elongation<br>
between two reference temperatures and is expressed in 10 -6 /°C.<br>
The linearity of the free deformation curve during the development of the<br>
concrete advantageously makes it possible to position the expansion joints precisely in the<br>
lining to be manufactured, which makes it possible efficiently to reduce the occurrence of<br>
expansion stresses in this lining and/or in a possible external metallic envelope in contact<br>
with the lining.<br>
The prefabricated block can be installed in its working position without having<br>
been fired.<br>
The characteristics of the prefabricated concrete will then develop following<br>
the firing up of the furnace or blast furnace, under the action of temperatures typically<br>
lying between 1300 and 1650°C.<br>
The final characteristics of the refractory lining are then obtained after the<br>
firing up of the reactor, which enables an appreciable energy saving and contributes to the<br>
preservation of the environment.<br>
The following tests are provided for purposes of illustration and do not limit<br>
the invention in any way.<br><br>
For these examples, different prefabricated blocks were manufactured<br>
following the steps a) to d) of the process described above.<br>
The following materials were utilized:<br>
-	mixture of brown electro-fused corundum grains marketed by Alcan, less than 30% of<br>
the grains, by weight, exhibiting a size lying between 1 and 15 mm. and 60%, by weight,<br>
exhibiting a size lying between 0.2 and 5 mm;<br>
-	black electro-fused corundum powder of size less than 150 microns, marketed by Alcan,<br>
-	mullite precursor powder based on andalousite exhibiting a size less than 500 microns,<br>
marketed by Damrec;<br>
-	silicon carbide powder (SiC) exhibiting a size less than about lOOum;<br>
-	silica fume of the 983 U type, marketed by Elkem;<br>
-	calcined alumina powder exhibiting a median diameter of about 4 microns, marketed by<br>
Almatis;<br>
-	cement based on aluminate of lime CA 270, marketed by Alcoa;<br>
-	reactive hydratable alumina of the Alphabond 300 type, marketed by Almatis;<br>
-	powdered dispersant HMPNa, marketed by Rhodia.<br>
The permeability was measured in air and at ambient temperature, according<br>
to the standard ISO 8841.<br>
The corrosion tests were performed by rotating test pieces of dimensions<br>
30 x 30 x 150 mm3 at a linear speed of 2 cm per second, in a blast furnace and pig iron<br>
slag, at 1500°C. for 6 hours under argon.<br>
The degree of attack at the interface between the pig iron and the slag, and in<br>
contact with the pig iron, that is to say the reduction in thickness of the test piece, is<br>
measured as a percentage relative to the initial thickness.<br>
The measurements of the coefficients of free thermal expansion were<br>
performed on cylindrical test pieces of 50 mm diameter and 50 mm height, according to<br>
the standard NFB 40308. The measurements of the coefficients of thermal expansion<br>
under load were performed on test pieces of the same size, according to the standard ISO<br>
1893.<br>
The open porosity was measured according to the standard ISO 5017.<br><br>
The median pore diameter was determined from measurements of the pore<br>
diameter distribution made by mercury porosimetry.<br>
The permeability measurements were made on cylindrical test pieces of<br>
50 mm diameter and 30 mm thickness.<br>
The measurements of mechanical cold crushing strength were performed on<br>
cylindrical test pieces of 50 mm diameter and 50 mm height according to the standard<br>
NFB 40322.<br>
The oxidation tests were performed on test pieces of 30 x 30 x 150 mm3- under<br>
steam, at a temperature of 1000°C, for 24 hours, according to the standard ASTM C863.<br>
Tables 1 and 2 below summarize the results obtained.<br><br><br><br><br>
(*): Almost complete destruction of the test piece<br>
It is considered that the coefficient of free thermal expansion varies linearly<br>
when there is a straight line such that the linear regression coefficient (R2) of the<br>
expansion curve, with no load, relative to that straight line is greater than or equal to 0.95<br>
over the range 20°C-1600°C.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 are provided as comparison examples. Example 1 is<br>
representative of products with very low alumina cement content, whereas Example 2 is<br>
representative of carbon-containing products.<br>
Table 1 shows clearly that the refractory concretes A and B according to the<br>
invention exhibit a lower permeability to air and a lower median pore size, also relative to<br>
the carbon-containing product of Example 1. The concretes according to the invention also<br>
exhibit a resistance to corrosion by the slag and the pig iron greater than that of the<br><br><br>
products containing aluminous cement and a resistance to oxidation in steam markedly<br>
greater than that of the carbon-containing products of Example 2. In the applications under<br>
consideration, the concretes according to the invention constitute an optimal compromise.<br>
Of course, the invention is not limited to the implementation modes described,<br>
which are provided by way of illustration and are non-limiting.<br>
In particular, the concrete according to the invention can be constituted on the<br>
spot, the moist mixture being projected, by a standard technique, onto the wall to be<br>
covered. The concrete of the invention can also be used in applications other than blast<br>
furnaces, for example as the lining of a furnace used for the melting of metals.<br><br>
