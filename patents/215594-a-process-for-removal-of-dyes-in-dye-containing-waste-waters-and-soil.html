				<td>This invention relates to a process for removal of dyes in dye containing waste-waters and soil. The present invention particularly relates to a process for removal of synthetic dyes in dye containing waste-waters and soil using the lignin-modifying white-rot fungus, Flavodon flavus (Kl) Ryv., NIOCC isolate 312. Further this invention relates to 80-100% removal within four days after addition of synthetic dyes such as azo dyes, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes to the 4 day old culture of Flavodon flavus.<br>
Textile and dyestuff industries are the major contributors to industrial pollutants containing dyes. These dyes are highly stable in light and are also resistant to<br>
microbial attack. Most of these dyes are azo dyes and under anaerobic conditions, the<br>
azo linkages are reduced to form aromatic amines and these are toxic and carcinogenic<br>
(Meyer, U. 1981. Biodegradation of synthetic organic colorants. Federation of European Microbiological Societies Symposium. 12: 371-385). Due to the. importance attached to prevention of environmental pollution, environmental agencies all over the world are imposing strict regulations for mitigation of pollution from industries. The effluents from the textile industries containing fast colored dyes are a major source of concern for environmentalist since such dyes beside causing aesthetic damage to sites, are toxic and carcinogenic. Industrial effluents from textiles, paper and pulp industries and leather industries contain chromogenic substances as well as high concentrations of salts, especially chlorides and sulfates (Public Health Engineering-Design in Metric waste-water treatment by R. E. Bartlett, 1971, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London). Remediation of such dye containing waste-waters using biological methods is termed bioremediation Thus, this invention particularly relates to<br>
degradation of synthetic dyes in the presence of salts by the fungus F. flavus deposited<br>
at the National Institute of Oceanography, Dona Paula, Goa 400004, India and having<br>
the accession number NIOCC 312, in textile waste-water treatment, and bioremediation<br>
of soil. The said fungus can be grown in synthetic media prepared with either distilled<br>
water or 50% artificial sea water. The said fungus can also be grown in conventional<br>
media or in powdered sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled water or 50% artificial<br>
sea water to raise large biomass of the fungus for application in field trials for<br>
bioremediation in the presence of sea water or fresh water. The said fungus thus grown<br>
can be immobilized by conventional methods and used for removal of various synthetic<br>
dyes from contaminated soil as well as aquatic habitats. The said fungus, F. flavus<br>
produces lignin-modifying enzymes such as manganese-dependent peroxidase E. C.<br>
1.11.1.7 (MNP), lignin peroxidase, E. C. 1.11.1.7 (LIP) and laccase, E. C. 1.10.3.2<br>
when grown on sugarcane bagasse suspended in plain distilled water or in 50%<br>
artificial sea water or in conventional media prepared with distilled water or 50%<br>
artificial sea water. By virtue of these lignin-modifying enzymes which break down a<br>
broad range of polymeric substrates, this fungus is useful in degradation of pollutants<br>
such as synthetic dyes. Thus degradation of synthetic dyes in waste-waters can be<br>
achieved by using the fungus F. flavus in fresh water as well as estuarine conditions.<br>
Normally, the textile dye waste-waters disposal includes physical-chemical treatment, waste minimization and biological treatment. Biological treatment includes biological pretreatment with activated sludge of textile waste-waters, and treatment in stabilization ponds (Groff, K.A. 1992, Textile waste. Water-Environment Research, 64:<br>
725-729.). Unfortunately, waste-water treatment facilities are often unable to completely remove commercial dyestuff from contaminated waters and thus contribute to pollution of aquatic habitats. Some of these synthetic dyes are carcinogenic and are suggested to be responsible for tumor growth in some species of fish (see Bumpus J. A., B. J. Brock. 1988. Biodegradation of crystal violet by the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 54:1143-1150).<br>
Various organisms have been tried for degradation of dyes in textile waste-waters and bioremediation.<br>
(i) Reference may be made to the Japanese patent wherein a green alga Chlorella vulgaris is used for degradation of methylene blue by irradiating a microalga fermentor to generate OH radicals which in turn help in degradation of the dye (Japanese patent JP06047394, Title: Organic dye degradation in waste-water, Date of issue: 22.02.94). The method has disadvantage as it involves irradiating the fermentor containing microalga and thus becomes expensive.<br>
(ii) Reference may be made to a U.S. patent wherein, living, dead, free, immobilized white-rot fungi Myrothecium or Ganoderma spp. have been employed for adsorption, dye degradation and color removal (US patent US5091089, Title: Decolorization of dye-containing waste-water, Date of issue: 25.02.92). These fungi have not been tested for their efficiency in color removal in the presence of sea salts.<br>
(iii) Reference may be made to US patent wherein, white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and actinomycetes Streptomyces spp are used in degradation of<br>
low nitrogen medium.<br>

Although, the fungus strain used here has the same characteristics as already described in the literature, the novelty lies in of novel strain in the process of decolorization of synthetic dyes as described here.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for removal of dyes such as azo dyes, hetrocyclic &amp; polymeric dyes from dye-containing waste-waters and soil which comprises, growing the white-rot fungus strain Flavodon flavus (as such or immobilized) such as here in described, on any conventional nutrient medium containing assimilable Carbon and Nitrogen source, with optinally having salinity up to 15 parts per thousand(ppm) for at least 4 days, then contacting the said biomass with waste-waters or soil containing dyes for a minimum period of 5 days followed by removing the fungal biomass by conventional methods in case of waste-waters to get water devoid of dyes.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for removal of dyes using the lignin-modifying white-rot fungus, Flavodon flavus, NIOCC 312 for possible use in dye-containing waste-water and in saline soils, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above. The said fungus can be efficiently utilized for the above-mentioned usage in fresh water as well as under estuarine conditions because of its tolerance to sea salts.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for growing the fungus on a large scale using an inexpensive raw material such as sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled water or 50% artificial sea water or simple medium like malt extract broth prepared with fresh water as well as 50% artificial sea water. The biomass of the fungus prepared in this manner can be used for seeding soil contaminated with synthetic dyes for treating dye-containing wastwater under normal conditions or under estuarine conditions. The biomass of the said fungus thus raised can also be immobilized using conventional methods used for immobilizing fungi and used for bioremediation of dye-containing aquatic systems.<br>

Although, the fungus strain used here has the same characteristics as already described in the literature, the novelty lies in of novel strain in the process of decolorization of synthetic dyes as described here.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for removal of dyes such as azo dyes, hetrocyclic &amp; polymeric dyes from dye-containing waste-waters and soil which<br>
(OSSUiJ^fft ii^^obiytir<br>
comprises, growing the white-rot fungus strain Flavodon flavusj^such as here in described, on any conventional nutrient medium containing assimilable Carbon and Nitrogen source, with optinally having salinity up to 15 parts per thousand(ppm) for at least 4 days, then contacting the said biomass with waste-waters or soil containing dyes for a minimum period of 5 days followed by removing the fungal biomass by conventional methods in case of waste-waters to get water devoid of dyes.<br>
In an embodiment of the present -invention, the carbon source lor growing the fungus used is selected from glucvose or sugarcane bagasse at a concentration of at least 1%.In another embodiment of the present invention, the proportion of nitrogen used soluble low and preferably be ammonium tartrate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the salinity of the medium or growing the fungus ranges between 0 to 15 parts per thousand.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the age of the said fungus is at least 4 days to get maximum decolorization of the said dyes.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the fungal biomas is immobilized on a conventional support such as nylon mesh and like in any conventional manner such as immobilization or adsorption.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the dyes such as azo, heterocyclic and polymeric dyes are removed by contacting with the said fugal biomass.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the removal of fungal biomass is carried out by manual removal or filtration.<br>
The organism given in the present invention is a white-rot basidiomycete fungus<br>
isolated from a decaying marine plant from a coastal marine environment and identified<br>
as Flavodon flavus. The said fungus F. flavus can be grown in malt extract broth<br>
containing 2% malt extract and 0.3% peptone in distilled water. The fungal mat grown<br>
this way can be macerated using a homogeniser and used as starter inoculum for the<br>
experimental cultures of synthetic media prepared in distilled water or in 50% artificial<br>
seawater. The synthetic media can be prepared in distilled water or 50% artificial sea<br>
water containing 1% glucose as carbon source, 2.4 mM ammonium tartrate as the<br>
nitrogen source, thiamine, trace metal solution, macro element solution containing'<br>
potassium and manganese salts  Tween 80, veratryl alcohol and 20 mM sodium<br>
acetate buffer at pH 4.5. This medium is referred to as low nitrogen medium. An<br>
example of the process for dye degradation involves addition of various synthetic dyes<br>
such as Azure B, Brilliant Green, Congo Red, Crystal Violet, Remazol Brilliant Blue R<br>
and polymeric dyes such as Poly B-411 and Poly R-478 at a final concentration of<br>
0.02% to 3 day old cultures of F.flavus growing in malt extract broth, synthetic medium<br>
prepared with distilled water or 50% artificial sea water. The degradation of dyes, can<br>
be monitored spectrophotometrically by removing an aliquot of sample from these<br>
cultures and measuring changes in absorbance at respective wavelengths of various<br>
dyes every alternate day up to 10 days. Heat-killed cultures serve as controls, where no<br>
decolorization or degradation of dyes is observed Moreover, the said fungus can be grown on a large scale using an inexpensive raw material such as sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled water or in 50% artificial sea water. The said fungus produces lignin-modifying enzymes such as manganese-dependent peroxidase (MNP), lignin peroxidase (LIP) and laccase, in conventional media prepared with distilled water as well as in media prepared with 50% artificial sea water.<br>
The said fungus Flavodon flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, is capable of growing in the presence of salts whose concentration is similar to that found in half-strength sea water. Most of the industrial effluents from textiles, dyestuff, paper and pulp and leather industries contain chromogenic substances as well as high concentrations of salts, especially chlorides and sulfates (Public Health Engineering - Design in Metric waste-water treatment by R. E. Bartlett, 1971, Applied Science Publishers Ltd., London). In light of this, salt tolerant organisms are better suited for such waste-water treatments. Most of the fungi used for bioremediation of such colored waste-waters have not been tested for their salt tolerance. In view of this, the present process has an advantage over the conventional processes referred to in various patents discussed above. White-rot fungi are unique among eukaryotic microbes in possessing powerful lignin-degrading oxidative enzymes such as MNP, LIP and lacasses which have a broad substrate specificity and are thus able to oxidize several environmental pollutants. Results from several laboratories have shown that the ability of white-rot fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor   to degrade an array of pollutants including synthetic dyes such as axo, heterocyclic and polycyclic dyes is due to the lignin-modifying/degrading system (C A. Reddy. 1995. The potential for white-rot<br>
fungi in the treatment of pollutants. Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 6: 320-328). Our fungal isolate F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, obtained from marine environment also produces lignin-modifying enzymes such as MNP LIP and laccase. It produces these enzymes in natural media such as ME broth, conventional synthetic medium prepared with distilled water or 50% artificial sea water and also in powdered sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled water or in 50% artificial sea water, and degrades synthetic dyes such as Azure B, Brilliant Green, Crystal Violet, Congo Red, Remazol Brilliant Blue R and polymeric dyes such as Poly B and Poly R.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE-1<br>
A non-spbrulating form of the fungus was isolated from decaying brown leaves of sea grass from the: intertidal of a lagoon in Kavaratti island of the Lakshadweep archipelago (10°30'-11.0° N Lat, 72.0°-73.0°E, Long.) off the west coast of India in the Arabian sea. Discs 
this synthetic medium. However, it produced fertile basidiomata on medium containing alpha cellulose or after a long incubation in malt extract agar medium. Based on fertile basidiomata using the key of Ryvarden and Johansen, it was identified as Flavodon flavus (Kl) Ryv.<br>
Since the strain #312 was isolated from a marine habitat, the effect of salinity on<br>
its growth can be studied by growing in medium prepared with 100% sea water, 50%<br>
sea water and in distilled water. Growth in natural medium such as malt extract broth<br>
and synthetic media were compared for this purpose. Malt extract broth contains 2%<br>
malt extract and 0.3% peptone in distilled water or seawater of various salinities.<br>
Instead of natural-seawater which may not be available to every one, synthetic .sea<br>
salts 'of reputed companies can be used in preparing artificial sea water. We used<br>
Instant Ocean-salts obtained from Aquarium Systems,  Mentor Ohio,  USA.  By<br>
dissolving 15 g and 30 g of Instant Ocean salts in 1 litre of distiHed water, salinity<br>
equivalents of 1.5 and 3.0% were obtained. The former is referred to as 50% artificial<br>
sea water or half-strength sea water. The synthetic media can be prepared in distilled<br>
water or-50% artificial sea water containing 1% glucose as carbon source,., 2.4mM<br>
ammonium tartrate as the nitrogen source, thiamine, trace metal solution, macro<br>
element solution containing sodium, potassium and manganese salts, Tween 80,<br>
veratryl alcohol and 20mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 4,5. This synthetic medium is<br>
referred to as low nitrogen medium. Growth of the fungus is measured as mycelial dry<br>
weight produced at the end of 10 days incubation in various media. For determination<br>
of dry weight, the contents of three flasks are vacuum filtered through tared Whatmen<br>
GF/C filter papers, rinsed with 100ml of distilled water to remove salts and dried to a constant weight and the net mycelial dry weight is calculated. Table 1.*<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Figures represent mg dry weight of fungus per 10 ml of medium in 10 days.<br>
The example given here shows that the fungus F. flavus grows much better in<br>
the presence of 50% artificial sea water and thus can be used in presence of synthetic salts or in estuarine conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE-2<br>
The ability of F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, to degrade and decolorize synthetic dyes was tested in nutrient rich medium such as malt extract broth. Preparation of medium was done as described in Example 1. Sterile media are dispensed in. 9 ml amounts into 125 ml sterile rubber-stoppered Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks are inoculated with 1ml of fungal inoculum. For inoculum preparation, mycelial mats grown in malt extract broth (25 ml in 250 ml foam-plugged Erlenmeyer flasks) for 10 days, at room temperature were washed twice with 150 ml of sterile water and blended in 20 ml of low nitrogen medium using a Sorvall blender (with four 30-seconds spurts). One ml of this blended mycelium (equivalent to 3 mg initial dry weight of mycelium) was used for inoculating media in 125 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks are flushed with 100% 02 at the time of inoculation and every alternate day thereafter. Culture flasks are<br>
incubated at room temperature. Individual dye solutions were added to 4-day-old<br>
cultures of F. flavus, to give final dye concentrations of 0.02%. The dyes used were<br>
Azure B, Brilliant Green, Crystal Violet, Congo Red, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Poly B-<br>
411 and Poly R-478. Stock solutions of dyes were prepared in distilled water and filter<br>
sterilized. Autoclaved cultures supplemented with dyes served as heat-killed controls.<br>
Aliquots (0.5ml) of culture supematants from experimental cultures and from heat-killed<br>
controls were removed aseptically at 2-day intervals, diluted appropriately with distilled<br>
water and the changes in absorbance maxima for the different dyes were measured<br>
using a Varian Cary 1 Bio UVA/isible spectrophotometer (Varian, Australia). Azure B<br>
was measured at 647 nm, Brilliant Green at 625 nm, Congo Red at 495 nm, Crystal<br>
Violet at 590 nm, and Remazol Brilliant Blue R at 595 nm. (Heinfling, A., M. Bergbauer,<br>
and U. Szewzyk. 1997. Biodegradation of azo and phthalocyanine dyes by Trametes<br>
versicolor and- Bjerkandera adusta. Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology. 48:261-<br>
266). Decolorization of Poiy B and Poly R was monitored by determining the absorption<br>
ratio at 593/483 nm and 513/362 nm respectively (Gold, M.H., J.K. Glenn, and M. Alic.<br>
1988. Use of polymeric dyes in lignin biodegradation assays. Methods in Enzymology.<br>
161: 74-78). The results are calculated as the difference in percent decolorization<br>
between heat-killed and experimental cultures. Degradation of various dyes was also<br>
monitored by comparing the changes in the visible spectra of native dyes in heat-killed<br>
culture fluids with that of decolorized dyes in experimental'culture fluids at 400-800 nm.<br>
This was carried out at the end of the experiment.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 1a-1g   shows the percentage of decolorization of various<br>
dyes by F. flevus, NIOCC isolate 312 when grown in simple natural medium such as malt extract broth. Azure B and Remazol Brilliant Blue R were decolorized up to 60% within 7 days. Decolorization of Poly B is delayed initially but the final percentage of decolorization is 60%.<br>
EXAMPLE-3<br>
Decolorization of various dyes by F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, was tested in synthetic medium such as low nitrogen medium prepared with distilled water. Preparation of synthetic medium was done as described in Example-1. Inoculation, oxygenation and incubation were done as described in Example-2. Experimental procedures of addition of dyes and monitoring the decolorization were same as described in Example-2.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 2a-2g show that about 70% decolorization of all the dyes took place within 7 days in low nitrogen medium prepared with distilled water.<br>
EXAMPLE-4<br>
Decolorization of various dyes by F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, was tested in synthetic medium such as low nitrogen medium prepared with half-strength artificial sea water. Artificial sea water was prepared by dissolving 15g of Instant Ocean salts as per the manufacturer's instructions (Instant Ocean of Aquarium Systems, Mentor, OH) in 1 litre of distilled water to get salinity equivalent of 15 parts per thousand and filtered through a GF/C filter paper. The normal salinity of sea water is 30 parts per thousand. Preparation of low nitrogen medium was done as described in Example-1. Inoculation, oxygenation and incubation were done as described in Example-2. Experimental<br>
procedures for addition of dyes and monitoring the decolorization were same as described in Example-2.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 3a-3g show decolorization of various dyes by F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, when grown in low nitrogen medium prepared with 50% artificial sea water. More than 80% decolorization of all dyes was achieved within 7 days in this medium.<br>
The fungus F. flavus also degraded the various dyes as seen by changes in the visible spectra of native dyes in experimental cultures in comparison with heat-killed control culture fluids. Figure 4a-4e shows complete degradation of some of the dyes by the fungus F. flavus when grown in low nitrogen medium with 50% artificial sea water.<br>
EXAMPLE-5<br>
In order to show  that degradation of dyes is brought about by production of.<br>
lignin-modifying enzymes in malt extract broth, the fungus was grown in this medium as<br>
described in Example-2.; Inoculation, oxygenation and incubation were carried out as<br>
described in Example-2.	.<br>
Gdntents df three flasks were filtered on different days of incubation using Whatman GF/C filters and the extracellular fluids were analysed for lignin-modifying enzymes such as manganese-dependent peroxidase (MNP), lignin peroxidase (LIP) and laccase. A convenient assay for MNP involves monitoring the enzyme's oxidation of Mn(ll) to Mn(lll). The reaction mixture contains enzyme, 0.1 M sodium tartrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 M H2O2 and 0.1 mM MnS04. Reactions are initiated by the addition of<br>
H2O2 and increase in absorbance at 238 nm is monitored during the first 5-30 sec of reaction. One unit of MNP oxidizes 1 µmol of Mn(ll)/min (Paszczyniski, A, R. L. Crawford, and V.-B. Huynh. 1988. Manganese peroxidase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium: purification. Methods in Enzymoiogy. 161: 264-270). Lignin peroxidase catalyzes oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde by H202, The reaction mixture for assay contains veratryi alcohol, tartaric acid at pH 3.0, 8 mM H2O2 and enzyme solution. Increase in absorbance at 310 nm is monitored for 1 min. One unit of enzyme is defined as 1 µmol of veratryl alcohol oxidized per min (Tien, M., and T. K. Kirk. 1988. Lignin peroxidase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Methods in Enzymoiogy. 161; 239-249). Lacasse activity was determined by using the substrate 2,21azino-bis{3-<br>
ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid),   in 0.1 M glycine buffer at pH 3.0. The reaction<br>
was monitored by measuring change in absorbance at 405 nm for 5 min. The enzyme<br>
units are expressed as nkatals/L (Niku-Paavola, M-L, E. Karhunen, P. Salola and V.<br>
Raunio.   1988.   Ligninolytic  enzymes  of  the  white-rot  fungus   Phlebia   radiata.<br>
Biochemical Journal. 254: 877-884). One katal is defined as one molar extinction<br>
coefficient of product formed per second.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 5a represents production of MNP in malt extract broth<br>
prepared with distilled water by the fungus F. fiavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>

Inoculation, incubation, oxygenation and sampling of culture filtrates were done as described in Example-5. Enzyme assays of the culture fluids were carried out as described in Example-5.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 7a represents production of. MNP in low nitrogen medium prepared with 50% artificial sea water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312. No<br>
LIP production was detected in this medium.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 7b represents production of laccase in low nitrogen medium prepared with 50% artificial sea water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>
EXAMPLE-8<br>
Wood and other lignocellulosics are natural substrates for ligninolytic fungi. Therefore, lignin-modifying enzyme production was compared in cultures grown in sugarcane bagasse, which is an inexpensive raw material for large-scale application of this fungus for its potential use in field trials. As the above examples 5, 6, and 7 showed, the degradation of dyes is brought about in various media by production of lignin-modifying enzymes in these media, we wanted to show production of these enzymes in bagasse medium also if it were to be used for application in field trials.<br>
For preparing media with lignocellulosics as the sole carbon/nitrogen/energy source, sugarcane bagasse powder (16 screen mesh/sq. in) was added at 1% final concentration in distilled water. To minimize contamination by residual sugars, the sugarcane bagasse was washed under running tap water for 12 h, followed by a wash with three volumes of distilled water and dried at room temperatures.<br>
The sugarcane bagasse medium was. inoculated, oxygenated, incubated and sampled as described in Example-5. The extracellular culture fluids were assayed for MNP, LIP and laccase as described in Example-5.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 8a represents production of MNP in sugarcane bagasse medium prepared with distilled water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 8b represents production of LIP in sugarcane bagasse<br>
medium prepared with distilled water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 8c represents production of laccase in sugarcane bagasse medium prepared with distilled water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>
It is of interest that MNP, which has been shown to be important in delignification of Kraft pulp (Paice, M.G., l.d. Reid, R. Bourbonnais, F. S. Archibald and L. Jurasek. 1993. Manganese peroxidase produced by Trametes versicolor during pulp bleaching, demethylates and delignifies kraft pulp. Applied Environmental Microbiology. 59:260-265), and in decolorizing Kraft bleach plant effluents (Michel, F. C. Jr., S. B. Dass, E.A. Grulke, and C.A. Reddy. 1991. Role of manganese peroxidases and lignin peroxrdases of Phanerochaete chrysosporium in decolorization of kraft bleach plant effluent. Applied Environmental Microbiology. 57: 2368-2375) was produced in highest titres in cultures of F. flavus grown with sugarcane bagasse. These results further suggest that sugarcane bagasse can potentially be used for bulk production of biomass of F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, for possible application in field trials for removal of dyes in dye-containing waste-waters and soil.<br>
EXAMPLE-9<br>
As the previous example showed production of lignin-modifying enzymes in sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled .water, for its application in presence of salts we can similarly grow the fungus in sugarcane bagasse suspended in half-strength artificial sea water. The medium was inoculated, oxygenated, incubated and sampled as described in the Example-5. The extracellular culture fluids were assayed for MNP, LIP and lacasse as described in Example-5.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 9a represents production of MNP in sugarcane bagasse medium prepared with half-strength artificial sea water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312. No LIP production was detected in this medium.<br>
Accordingly, Figure 9b represents production of laccase in sugarcane bagasse medium prepared with half-strength artificial sea water by the fungus F. flavus, NIOCC isolate 312.<br>
Examples 1-9 illustrate that the said fungus Flavodon flavus, NIOCC isolate 312, can be grown in conventional media prepared with distilled water or half-strength artificial sea water and in sugarcane bagasse suspended in distilled water or half-strength artificial sea water and the biomass of the fungus thus obtained can be used for removal of synthetic dyes in freshwater and estuarine conditions and in soil. The fungus can be immobilized using conventional methods and can be used for removal of synthetic dyes in aquatic habitats and soil. The above mentioned examples further illustrate that the degradation of synthetic dyes by the said fungus is brought about by production of lignin-modifying enzymes such as MNP, LIP and taccase in conventional media or in sugarcane bagasse medium prepared either with distilled water or half-strength artificial sea water.<br>
