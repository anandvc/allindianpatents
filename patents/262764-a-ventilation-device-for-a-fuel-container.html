Description<br>
Ventilation device for a fuel container<br>
The invention relates to a ventilation device for a fuel<br>
container, with a liquid trap connected to at least one<br>
ventilation line and with a suction jet pump, arranged in the<br>
liquid trap, for the conveyance of fuel out of the liquid trap<br>
into the fuel container.<br>
Such ventilation devices are often used for ventilating the<br>
fuel container during refueling and during operation and are<br>
therefore known. Mostly, in present-day ventilation devices,<br>
ventilation lines lead from a bubbling container designed as a<br>
liquid trap to various sides of the fuel container and, if<br>
appropriate, to an activated charcoal filter. The suction jet<br>
pump is connected to a fuel pump arranged in the fuel container<br>
and sucks away fuel accumulated in the liquid trap and conveys<br>
it back into the fuel container. However, the constant<br>
connection of the suction jet pump to the fuel pump means that,<br>
even when the liquid trap is empty, the suction jet pump is in<br>
operation and fuel is conveyed unnecessarily through the<br>
suction jet pump. This contributes to a disturbing formation of<br>
foam in the fuel container and to an unnecessary energy<br>
consumption of the fuel pump.<br>
The problem on which the invention is based is to configure a<br>
ventilation device of the type initially mentioned such that it<br>
avoids an unnecessary energy consumption for the suction jet<br>
pump and an unnecessary formation of foam in the fuel<br>
container.<br>
This problem is solved, according to the invention, in that the<br>
suction jet pump is connected to a valve, and in that<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 2 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
the valve can be switched as a function of the filling level of<br>
fuel in the liquid trap.<br>
By virtue of this configuration, the suction jet pump can be<br>
switched off via the valve when no fuel has accumulated in the<br>
liquid trap. Only above a filling level provided can the valve<br>
be opened and the suction jet pump be supplied with fuel. It is<br>
thereby possible in a particularly simple way to avoid the<br>
situation where the suction jet pump is kept in operation when<br>
the liquid trap is empty. Owing to the invention, switching off<br>
the suction jet pump when the liquid trap is empty prevents an<br>
unnecessary energy consumption and an unnecessary formation of<br>
foam in the fuel container.<br>
As a rule, it is sufficient to carry out the sucking away of<br>
the fuel from the liquid trap only when a filling level<br>
provided is reached. In this case, the ventilation device<br>
according to the invention has a particularly simple structural<br>
configuration when a filling-level limit switch for switching<br>
the valve is arranged in the liquid trap.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the filling-level limit switch has a particularly simple<br>
structural configuration when the filling-level limit switch<br>
has a float.<br>
The control of the valve could, for example, take place<br>
completely mechanically, in that a valve body movable against a<br>
valve seat is connected to the float. However, according to<br>
another advantageous development of the invention, the suction<br>
jet pump can be activated particularly reliably when the valve<br>
is switched electrically.<br>
The valve can be manufactured particularly cost-effectively<br>
when the valve has an electric actuator and a<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 3 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
valve body movable against a valve seat is connected to the<br>
actuator.<br>
The electrically switched valve has a particularly simple<br>
structural configuration when the electric actuator has an<br>
electromagnet or a piezo-element.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the control of the electrically switched valve is particularly<br>
simple when the filling-level limit switch has an electrical<br>
contact. The electrical contact can open and close as a<br>
function of the filling level in the liquid trap.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the control outlay for switching the valve can be kept<br>
particularly low when the electrical contact to the filling-<br>
level limit switch is arranged in series with the electric<br>
actuator of the valve.<br>
The ventilation device according to the invention allows a<br>
particularly versatile activation of the valve when the<br>
electrical contact to the filling-level limit switch and the<br>
electric actuator of the valve are connected to a common<br>
electronic control unit. In this case, for example, the<br>
activation of the valve may be absent at particularly low<br>
temperatures or when the internal combustion engine of the<br>
motor vehicle is started. In these cases, mostly, the entire<br>
fuel conveyed by the fuel pump is required for the internal<br>
combustion engine. The closing of the valve, which is possible<br>
by means of the electronic control unit, consequently prevents<br>
the situation where fuel is branched off to the suction jet<br>
pump of the liquid trap at low temperatures or when the<br>
internal combustion engine is started.<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 3a -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
The mounting of the ventilation device according to the<br>
invention is particularly simple when a baffle provided for<br>
mounting in the fuel container<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 4 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
has an electromotive fuel pump, when a conveying line of the<br>
fuel pump is connected to the suction jet pump, and when the<br>
baffle forms with the liquid trap a structural unit.<br>
Preferably, the baffle is fastened to the liquid trap.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
the valve and the suction jet pump can be assembled to form a<br>
particularly compact unit when the valve body of the valve is<br>
guided movably toward a nozzle of the suction jet pump. It<br>
thereby becomes possible for the valve to close or open the<br>
suction jet pump directly.<br>
According to another advantageous development of the invention,<br>
a disturbance in the conveyance of the suction jet pump by the<br>
valve body arranged near the nozzle can be avoided in a simple<br>
way when the valve is arranged in the conveying line.<br>
The invention permits numerous embodiments. To make its basic<br>
principal even clearer, one of these is illustrated in the<br>
drawing and is described below. In the drawing:<br>
fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a first embodiment of the<br>
ventilation device according to the invention,<br>
fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a further embodiment of the<br>
ventilation device according to the invention with an<br>
electronic control unit,<br>
fig. 3, 4 show two embodiments of a valve of the ventilation<br>
device according to the invention from figure 1 or 2<br>
with a piezo-element,<br><br>

Fig. 5, 6 show two embodiments of the valve of the ventilation<br>
device according to the invention from figure 1 or 2<br>
with an electromagnet,<br>
fig. 7, 8 show two embodiments of a completely mechanical valve<br>
of the ventilation device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows a ventilation device 1 for a fuel container 2 of<br>
a motor vehicle, with a liquid trap 3 arranged in the upper<br>
region. Ventilation lines 4 lead from the liquid trap 3 to<br>
lateral regions of the fuel container 2. Furthermore, a baffle<br>
5 with an electromotive fuel pump 6 is arranged on the bottom<br>
of the fuel container 2. The fuel pump 6 sucks in fuel from the<br>
baffle 5 and conveys it via a forward-flow line 7 to an<br>
internal combustion engine, not illustrated, of the motor<br>
vehicle. Arranged in the liquid trap 3 is a suction jet pump 8<br>
which is connected via a conveying line 9 to the forward-flow<br>
line 7 of the fuel pump 6. Arranged in the conveying line 9 is<br>
an electrically switchable valve 10 which is connected via an<br>
electrical line 12 to a liquid-level limit switch 11 arranged<br>
in the liquid trap 3. The filling-level limit switch 11, the<br>
electrically switchable valve 10 and the fuel pump 6 are<br>
likewise connected via electrical lines 13, 14 to a power<br>
supply 15 of the motor vehicle. The filling-level limit switch<br>
11 has an electrical contact 17 switchable by a float 16.<br>
When a fuel filling level provided is overshot in the liquid<br>
trap 3, the float 16 is deflected and closes the electrical<br>
contact 17 of the filling-level limit switch 11. Consequently,<br>
the electrically switchable valve 10 is connected to the power<br>
supply 15, opens and releases the conveying line 9. The fuel<br>
pump 6 consequently conveys fuel as a propellant to the suction<br>
jet pump 8. The<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 6 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
suction jet pump 8 subsequently sucks in accumulated fuel from<br>
the liquid trap 3 and conveys it via a discharge line 18 into<br>
the fuel container 2. Conversely, below the fuel filling level<br>
provided in the liquid trap 3, the electrically switchable<br>
valve 10 is not connected to the power supply 15, so that the<br>
suction jet pump 8 receives no fuel as a propellant and the<br>
entire fuel conveyed by the fuel pump 6 enters the forward-flow<br>
line 7.<br>
Figure 2 shows a further embodiment of the ventilation device 1<br>
which differs from that of figure 1 only in that the filling-<br>
level limit switch 11 arranged in the liquid trap 3 and the<br>
electrically switchable valve 10 are connected in each case to<br>
an electronic control unit 19. The electronic control unit 19<br>
activates the electronically switchable valve 10, as described<br>
with regard to figure 1. Furthermore, with an appropriate<br>
control program, the electronic control unit 19 can, for<br>
example, prevent an opening of the valve 10 when, in operating<br>
states provided, the entire fuel conveyed by the fuel pump 6 is<br>
to be conveyed into the forward-flow line 7. Such operating<br>
states prevail, for example, when the internal combustion<br>
engine is started and at low temperatures. A time-controlled<br>
opening of the valve 10 is likewise possible, thus ensuring<br>
that the liquid trap 3 is emptied reliably whenever the valve<br>
10 is switched.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate diagrammatically the valve 10<br>
outside the liquid trap 3. The valve 10 may, of course, also be<br>
arranged inside the liquid trap 3 and form with the suction jet<br>
pump 8 and/or the filling-level limit switch 11 a structural<br>
unit. In the case of a purely mechanical activation of the<br>
valve 10, moreover, in an alternative embodiment, not<br>
illustrated, no electrical lines 12, 14 for connecting the<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 7 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
valve 10 and the filling-level limit switch 11 to the power<br>
supply 15 are required.<br>
Figure 3 shows a structural unit consisting of a nozzle 2 0 of<br>
the section jet pump 8 and of the electrically switchable valve<br>
10. The electrically switchable valve 10 has an actuator 21<br>
with a piezo-element 22. When current is applied to the piezo-<br>
element 22, a valve body 23 is moved away from the nozzle 2 0 of<br>
the section jet pump 8 and releases the connection of the<br>
suction jet pump 8 to the conveying line 9. Electrical contacts<br>
24 serve for connecting the actuator 21 to the electrical lines<br>
12 illustrated in figures 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 4 shows a further embodiment of the structural unit<br>
consisting of a nozzle 2 0 of the suction jet pump 8 with the<br>
electrically switchable valve 10. As in the embodiment<br>
according to figure 3, the valve 10 has an actuator 25 with a<br>
piezo-element 26. The piezo-element 26 controls the movement of<br>
the valve body 23 via a lever 27.<br>
Figure 5 shows a further embodiment of the structural unit<br>
consisting of a nozzle 20 of the suction jet pump 8 with the<br>
electrically switchable valve 10. In contrast to the<br>
embodiments according to figures 3 and 4, the valve 10 has an<br>
actuator 28 with an electromagnet 29. The electromagnet 29<br>
moves a magnet 30 connected to the valve body 23. When current<br>
is applied appropriately, therefore, the valve body 23 is moved<br>
toward the nozzle 20 of the suction jet pump 8 or away from<br>
this.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further embodiment of the structural unit<br>
consisting of a nozzle 2 0 of the suction jet pump 8 with the<br>
electrically switchable valve 10, in which the valve 10 has an<br>
actuator 31 with an electromagnet 32. When current is applied<br>
appropriately, a closing cylinder 33 with a magnet 34 can be<br>
moved into the conveying line 9 and<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/066142	- 8 -<br>
2005P13758WOUS<br>
consequently interrupt the conveyance of fuel to the nozzle 2 0<br>
of the suction jet pump 8.<br>
Figure 7 shows a further embodiment of the ventilation device<br>
1, in which the valve 10 is arranged in the conveying line 9<br>
leading to the suction jet pump 8 and forms a structural unit<br>
with a filling-level limit switch 11. In contrast to the<br>
preceding embodiments, the valve 10 is connected to the float<br>
16 and consequently has a purely mechanical function. The float<br>
16 carries a magnet 35 which is mounted so as to be movable<br>
toward a wall of the conveying line 9. The valve 10 has a<br>
closing cylinder 3 6 guided longitudinally movably and having a<br>
magnet 37. When the float 16 lies on the wall, the closing<br>
cylinder 36 is pulled up and closes the conveying line 9. The<br>
position of the float 16 lying on the wall of the conveying<br>
line 9 is illustrated by dashes and dots in figure 7. Of<br>
course, that portion of the conveying line 9 which has the<br>
filling-level limit switch 11 must be arranged at the location<br>
provided in the liquid trap 3 illustrated in figures 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 8 shows a further embodiment of the ventilation device<br>
1, in which the valve 10 forms a structural unit with the<br>
nozzle 2 0 of the suction jet pump 8 and with the filling-level<br>
limit switch 11. The float 16 of the filling-level limit switch<br>
11 is connected via a lever 3 8 to the valve body 23 movable<br>
longitudinally displaceably toward the nozzle 20. As in the<br>
embodiment according to figure 7, hereto, the float 16 and the<br>
valve 10 must be arranged inside the liquid trap 3.<br><br>
