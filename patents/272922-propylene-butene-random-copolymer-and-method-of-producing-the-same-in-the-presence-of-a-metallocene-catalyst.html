				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a propylene/1-butene copolymer, a method for its<br>
preparation, and its use for pipes, in particular pressure pipes.<br>
Polymer materials are frequently used for the preparation of pipes for various purposes, such<br>
as fluid transport, e.g. water or natural gas. The transported fluid may be pressurized and<br>
have varying temperature, usually within the range of about 0°C to about 70°C. Such pipes<br>
are typically made of polyolefins. Because of the high temperatures involved, hot water<br>
pipes made from polyolefins have to meet specific requirements. The temperature in a hot<br>
water pipe might range from 30°C to 70°C. However, peak temperature can be up to 100°C.<br>
To secure long term use, the selected pipe material must be able to withstand a temperature<br>
exceeding the range mentioned above, According to the standard DIN 8078, a hot water pipe<br>
made of propylene homo- or copolymer must have a run time of at least 1000 h without<br>
failure at 95°C and a pressure of 3.5 MPa.<br>
Due to its high thermal resistance, if compared to other polyolefins, polypropylene is<br>
particularly useful for applications at increased temperature, such as hot water pipes.<br>
However, besides thermal resistance, a polypropylene useful for pipe applications needs to<br>
have high stiffness in combination with high resistance to slow crack growth.<br>
There are two different cracking modes of polypropylene pipes: ductile or brittle failure.<br>
Ductile failure is associated with macroscopic yielding, i.e. there is a large material pull out<br>
adjacent to the location of failure.<br>
However, the majority of cracking taking place in polypropylene pipes is of brittle type and<br>
does not exhibit large deformation. Brittle failure usually occurs under low stress and takes a<br>
long time to propagate through the material via the process of slow crack growth. Such type<br>
of failure is the least-desirable since it is difficult to detect at an early stage.<br>
Thus, for any polypropylene being useful for pipe applications, in particular pressure pipe<br>
applications, it is desired to have a beneficial compromise between high resistance to slow<br>
crack growth, thermal resistance, rigidity, and impact strength. However, quite frequently it<br>
 <br>
turns out that one of these properties can only be achieved on the expense of the other<br>
properties.<br>
Pipes made of propylene homopolymer show high thermal resistance in combination with<br>
high rigidity whereas resistance to slow crack growth is lowered. Slow crack growth<br>
properties can be improved by using propylene copolymers. However, the incorporation of<br>
comonomers into the polypropylene chain has a detrimental impact on thermal resistance<br>
and rigidity, an effect that needs to be compensated by mixing with an additional propylene<br>
homopolymer component. Furthermore, the higher the comonomer content, the higher is the<br>
risk that polymeric material is washed out by the transport fluid.<br>
WO 2005/040271 A1 discloses a pressure pipe comprising a resin formed from (i) a random<br>
copolymer comprising units of propylene and a C2 to C10 alpha-olefin, and (ii) a propylene-<br>
ethylene elastomer.<br>
WO 2006/002778 Al discloses a pipe system having at least one layer comprising a semi-<br>
crystalline random copolymer of propylene and 1 -butene. The copolymer exhibits a broad<br>
monomodal molecular weight distribution and has a rather high xylene solubles content.<br>
WO 03/042260 discloses a pressure pipe made from a propylene copolymer which is at least<br>
partially crystallized in the β-modification.<br>
Considering the requirements of pressure pipe materials discussed above, it is an object of<br>
the present invention to provide a polypropylene having a high resistance to slow crack<br>
propagation while still keeping thermal resistance and rigidity on a high level. Furthermore,<br>
it is desired to minimize the potential risk of washing out polymeric material from the pipe<br>
by the pressurized fluid.<br>
The finding of the present invention is to provide a β-nucleated propylene 1-butene<br>
copolymer with low amounts of xylene solubles.<br>
 <br>
Thus the object outlined above is in particular solved by a propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(a)	comprising at least 1-butene as a comonomer,<br>
(b)	having a comonomer content in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 wt.-%,<br>
(c)	having a xylene soluble fraction (XCS) equal or below 2.5 wt.-%, more preferably<br>
having a xylene soluble fraction (XCS) equal or below 1.5 wt.-%, like equal or<br>
below 1.0 wt.-%, and<br>
(d)	being partially crystallized in the β-modification.<br>
Preferably the propylene copolymer (A) comprises a β-nucleating agent (B). Even more<br>
preferably the propylene copolymer (A) has a polydispersity index (PI) of equal or below 4.0<br>
Pa-1. yet more preferably equal or below 3.5 Pa"1, still more preferably equal or below 2.9 Pa"<br>
1. like equal or below 2.7 Pa-1. Still more preferably the propylene copolymer (A) is featured<br>
by the fact that the part of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(i) crystallized in the α-modification has a melting temperature below 150 °C, more<br>
preferably below 148 °C and/or<br>
(ii) crystallized in the p-modification has a melting temperature below 138 °C, more<br>
preferably below 136 °C.<br>
Yet more preferably the propylene copolymer (A) according to this invention fulfils the<br>
equation<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
[XCS] is the amount of xylene soluble fraction (XCS) of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
given in weight percent, and<br>
[C] is the amount of comonomer of the propylene copolymer (A) in weight percent.<br>
Surprisingly it has been found out that with the propylene copolymer (A) according to the<br>
invnetion pipes are obtainable having superior slow crack propagation performance<br>
 <br>
compared to pipes being state of the art. Moreover not only the slow crack propagation<br>
performance of the pipes based on the inventive propylene copolymer (A) according to the<br>
invention is outstanding but additionally also the stiffness and the impact performance of the<br>
pipe and of the propylene copolymer (A) are excellent. In particular the Izod impact<br>
resistance at low temperatures and the flexural modulus are above average (compare table 2).<br>
In the following the invention is described in more detail.<br>
One important requirement of the present invention is that the propylene copolymer (A) has<br>
a rather low xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS).<br>
Xylene solubles are the part of the polymer soluble in cold xylene determined by dissolution<br>
in boiling xylene and letting the insoluble part crystallize from the cooling solution (for the<br>
method see below in the experimental part). The xylene solubles fraction contains polymer<br>
chains of low stereo-regularity and is an indication for the amount of non-crystalline areas.<br>
Accordingly it is preferred that the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the inventive<br>
propylene copolymer (A) is equal or less than 2.5 wt.-%, more preferably less than 2.0 wt-<br>
%, still more preferably less than 1.5 wt.-%, yet more preferably less than 1.0 wt.-%. In<br>
preferred embodiments the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) are in the range of 0.1 to<br>
1.5 wt.-% and more preferably in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 wt.-%.<br>
As further requirement of the present invention is the inventive propylene copolymer (A)<br>
must be B-nucleated, i.e. the propylene copolymer (A) must be partially crystallized in the B-<br>
modification. Thus it is preferred that the amount of B-modification of the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) is at least 50 %, more preferably at least 60 %, still more preferably at least<br>
65 %, yet more preferably at least 70 %, still yet more preferably at least 80 %, like about<br>
90 % (determined by DSC using the second heat as described in detail in the example<br>
section).<br>
 <br>
Of course the propylene copolymer (A) may also comprise β-nucleating agents (B). As β-<br>
nucleating agent (B) any nucleating agent can be used which is suitable for inducing<br>
crystallization of the propylene copolymer (A) in the hexagonal or pseudo-hexagonal<br>
modification. Preferred β-nucleating agents (B) are those listed below, which also includes<br>

bis-cyclohexanecarboxamide, and<br>
 <br>
•	N,N'-C5-C8-cycloalkyI-bis-cyclohexanecarboxamide compounds such as<br>

•	N-phenyl-5-(N-benzoylamino)pentaneamide and N-cyclohexyl-4-(N-<br>

•	dihydroquinacridone type compounds, e. g.<br>

Still further suitable p-nucleating agents (B) are<br>
•	dicarboxylic acid salts of metals from group IIa of periodic system, e. g. pimelic acid<br>

•	mixtures of dicarboxylic acids and salts of metals from group IIa of periodic system.<br>
Still further suitable β-nucleating agents (B) are<br>
•	salts of metals from group IIa of periodic system and imido acids of the formula<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein x = 1 to 4; R = H,-COOH, C1-C12-alkyl, C5-C8-cycloalkyl or C6-C12-aryl,<br>
and Y =C1-C12-alkyl, C5-C8-cycloalkyl or C5-C12-aryl-substituted bivalent C6-C12-<br>
aromatic residues, e. g.<br>
calcium salts of phthaloylglycine, hexahydrophthaloylglycine, N-phthaloylalanine<br>
and/or N-4-methylphthaloylglycine.<br>
Preferred B-nucleating agents (B) are any one or mixtures of N, N'-dicyclohexyl-2, 6-<br>
naphthalene dicarboxamide, quinacridone type or pimelic acid calcium-salt (EP 0 682 066).<br>
The amount of B-nucleating agents (B) within the propylene copolymer (A) is preferably up<br>
to 2.0 wt.-%, more preferably up to 1.5 wt.-%, like 1.0 wt.-%. Thus it is appreciated that the<br>
B-nucleating agents (B) are present within the propylene copolymer (A) from 0.0001 to<br>
2.0000 wt.-%, more preferably from 0.005 to 0.5000 wt.-%.<br>
In this context it is mentioned that the polypropylene copolymer (A) may comprise additives<br>
as usual in the art. However, the polypropylene copolymer (A) does not comprise further<br>
other polymer types. Thus the propylene copolymer (A) can be seen as a composition of said<br>
propylene polymer (A) and the B-nucleating agents (B) and optionally further additives, but<br>
without other polymers.<br>
Accordingly the propylene polymer (A) may comprise up to 10 wt.-% additives, which<br>
includes the mandatory fl-nucleating agents (B) but optionally also fillers and/or stabilizers<br>
and/or processing aids and/or antistatic agents and/or pigments and/or reinforcing agents.<br>
Further it is mandatory that the polypropylene copolymer (A) comprises at least 1-butene as<br>
comonomer.<br>
 <br>
However, the propylene copolymer (A) may comprise further α-olefin(s), like C2, C5 to C10<br>
a-olefin(s). In such a case ethylene is in particular preferred. Thus in one preferred<br>
embodiment the propylene copolymer (A) is a terpolymer comprising propylene, 1-butene<br>
and ethylene. However, it is more preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) does not<br>
comprise further comonomer(s), i.e. 1-butene is the only comonomer of the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) (binary propylene-butene copolymer).<br>
Thus the binary propylene-1-butene copolymer is particularly preferred.<br>
More preferably the above defined propylene copolymer (A) is a random copolymer. Thus a<br>
random propylene copolymer according to the present invention is a random propylene<br>
copolymer produced by statistical insertion of units of 1-butene (if present with units of<br>
ethylene or a C5 to C10 α-olefin, preferably ethylene, to give a random terpolymer). The<br>
Randomness indicates the amount of isolated comonomer units, i.e. those which have no<br>
other comonomer units in the neighbour, compared to the total amount of comonomers in the<br>
polymer chain. In a preferred embodiment, the randomness of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
is at least 30 %, more preferably at least 50 %, even more preferably at least 60 %, and still<br>
more preferably at least 65 %.<br>
The type of comonomer has a significant influence on a number of properties like<br>
crystallization behaviour, stiffness, melting point or flowability of the polymer melt Thus to<br>
solve the objects of the present invention, in particular to provide an improved balance<br>
between stiffness, impact resistance and slow crack propagation performance it is necessary<br>
that the propylene copolymer comprises 1-butene as a comonomer at least in a detectable<br>
manner, in particular of at least 1.0 wt.-%. On the other hand the increase of the comonomer<br>
content, in particular of 1-butene, in the propylene copolymer (A) may drop the stiffness.<br>
Thus, it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) comprises preferably not more than<br>
up to 3.0 wt.-% comonomer, in particular 1-butene, based on the weight of the propylene<br>
copolymer (A). As stated above the comonomer 1-butene is mandatory whereas other a-<br>
 <br>
olefins can be additionally present. However the amount of additional α-olefins shall<br>
preferably not exceed the amount of 1-butene in the propylene copolymer (A). More<br>
preferably the amount of comonomer, in particular of 1-butene, within the propylene<br>
copolymer is equal or below 2.2 wt-%, still more preferably equal or below 2.0 wt.-% and<br>
yet more preferably equal or below 1.8 wt-%. Accordingly the amount of comonomer, in<br>
particular 1-butene, within the propylene copolymer (A) is from 1.0 to 3.0 wt-%, more<br>
preferably from 1.0 to 2.2 wt.-%, still more preferably from 1.0 to 2.0 wt.-%, yet more<br>
preferably of 1.0 to 1.9 wt.-%, yet still more preferably of 1.0 to 1.8 wt.-%. In a particular<br>
preferred embodiment the amount of comonomer, in particular 1-butene, is 1.0 to 1.8 wt.-%,<br>
more preferred 1.1 to 1.6 wt.-%.<br>
In case the propylene copolymer (A) is a binary propylene-1-butene copolymer - an<br>
embodiment which is particularly preferred - the ranges as defined in the previous paragraph<br>
refer to 1-butene only.<br>
The comonomer content of the propylene copolymer (A) can be determined with FT infrared<br>
spectroscopy, as described below in the examples.<br>
One remarkable improvement in the present invention is that comonomers, like 1-butene,<br>
can be inserted in the propylene copolymer chain without significantly increasing the xylene<br>
cold soluble fraction (XCS), an undesired phenomena observed by propylene copolymers<br>
produced in the presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
Accordingly a particular finding is that the propylene copolymer (A) satisfies the formula<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
[XCS] is the amount of xylene soluble fraction (XCS) of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
given in weight percent, and<br>
[C] is the amount of comonomer of the propylene copolymer (A) in weight percent.<br>
Additionally it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) is an isotactic propylene<br>
copolymer. Thus it is preferred that the propylene copolymer has a rather high pentad<br>
concentration, i.e. higher than 90 %, more preferably higher than 92 %, still more preferably<br>
higher than 95 % and yet more preferably higher than 98 %.<br>
Further it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) is not chemically modified as it is<br>
known for instance from high melt strength polymers (HMS-polymer). Thus the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) is not cross-linked. The impact behaviour can normally also improved by<br>
using branched polypropylenes as for instance described in EP 0 787 750, i.e. single<br>
branched polypropylene types (Y-polypropylenes having a backbone with a single long side-<br>
chain and an architecture resembles a "Y"). Such polypropylenes are characterized by rather<br>
high melt strength. A parameter of the degree of branching is the branching index g'. The<br>
branching index g' correlates with the amount of branches of a polymer. The branching index<br>
g' is defined as g'=[IV]br/[IV]tin in which g' is the branching index, [IVbr] is the intrinsic<br>
viscosity of the branched polypropylene and [IV]tin is the intrinsic viscosity of the linear<br>
polypropylene having the same weight average molecular weight (within a range of ±10 %)<br>
as the branched polypropylene. Thereby, a low g'-value is an indicator for a high branched<br>
polymer. In other words, if the g'-value decreases, the branching of the polypropylene<br>
increases. Reference is made in this context to B.H. Zimm and W.H. Stockmeyer, J. Chem.<br>
Phys. 17,1301 (1949). This document is herewith included by reference. Thus it is preferred<br>
that the branching index g' of the propylene copolymer (A) shall be at least 0.85, more<br>
preferably at least 0.90, yet more preferably at least 0.95, like 1.00.<br>
 <br>
A further essential aspect of the instant invention is that the propylene copolymer (A) has a<br>
rather low melting temperature compared to known Ziegler-Natta polypropylene<br>
counterparts. Accordingly the inventive propylene copolymer (A) is preferably further<br>
characterized in that the part of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(i) crystallized in the a-modification has a melting temperature below 150 °C, more<br>
preferably below 152 °C, yet more preferably below 151 °Cand/or<br>
(ii) crystallized in the p-modification has a melting temperature below 141 °C, more<br>
preferably below 140 °C, yet more preferably below 139 °C.<br>
Accordingly it is in particular appreciated that the part of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
(i) crystallized in the a-modification has a melting temperature of 135 to 152 °C, more<br>
preferably 138 to 151 °C, yet more preferably 140 to 150 °C and/or<br>
(ii) crystallized in the P-modification has a melting temperature 128 to 142 °C, more<br>
preferably 130 to 141 °C, yet more preferably 132 to 140 °C.<br>
The melting temperature of the part of the propylene copolymer (A) crystallized in the a-<br>
modification has a higher melting temperature compared to part of the propylene copolymer<br>
(A) crystallized the P-modification. The measuring method is defined in the example sectioa<br>
It is further important requirement is that the propylene copolymer (A) must show a rather<br>
narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD).<br>
The molecular weight distribution (MWD) can be measured by SEC (also known as GPC),<br>
whereby it is expressed as Mw/Mn, or by a rheological measurement, like Polydispersity<br>
Index (PI) - measurement or Shear Thinning Index (SHI) - measurement. In the present case<br>
primarily the Polydispersity Index (PI) is used as measurement. All the measurements are<br>
known in art and further defined below in the example section.<br>
Thus the propylene copolymer (A) has preferably a Polydispersity Index (PI) of equal or<br>
below 4.0 Pa-1, preferably of equal or below 3.5 Pa-1 more preferably of equal or below 3.0<br>
Pa-1, still more preferably of equal or below 2.8 Pa1, like equal or below 2.5 Pa-1. Lower<br>
 <br>
values of the Polydispersity Index (PI) may be 1.0 Pa-1, like 1.5 Pa-1. Thus the Polydispersity<br>
Index (PI) of the propylene copolymer (A) is preferably in the range of 0.5 to 4.0 Pa-1, more<br>
preferably in the range of 1.0 to 3.0 Pa-1, yet more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 2.9, like<br>
1.3 to 2.6 Pa-1.<br>
Moreover the propylene copolymer (A) can be unimodal or multimodal, like bimodal in<br>
view of the molecular weight distribution and/or the comonomer content distribution.<br>
When the matrix is unimodal with respect to the molecular weight distribution and/or<br>
comonomer content, it may be prepared in a single stage process e.g. as slurry or gas phase<br>
process in a slurry or gas phase reactor. Preferably, the unimodal propylene copolymer (A) is<br>
polymerized as a slurry polymerization. Alternatively, the unimodal propylene copolymer<br>
(A) may be produced in a multistage process using at each stage process conditions which<br>
result in similar polymer properties.<br>
The expression "multimodal" or "bimodal" used herein refers to the modality of the polymer,<br>
i.e.<br>
the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph of the<br>
molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight,<br>
or more preferably<br>
the form of its comonomer content distribution curve, which is the graph of the<br>
comonomer content as a function of the molecular weight of the polymer fractions.<br>
As will be explained below, the polymer components of the propylene copolymer (A) can be<br>
produced in a sequential step process, using reactors in serial configuration and operating at<br>
different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific reactor<br>
will have its own molecular weight distribution and/or comonomer content distribution.<br>
When the distribution curves (molecular weight or comonomer content) from these fractions<br>
are superimposed to obtain the molecular weight distribution curve or the comonomer<br>
content distribution curve of the final polymer, these curves may show two or more maxima<br>
 <br>
or at least be distinctly broadened when compared with curves for the individual fractions.<br>
Such a polymer, produced in two or more serial steps, is called bimodal or multimodal,<br>
depending on the number of steps.<br>
Accordingly the propylene copolymer (A) may be multimodal, like bimodal, in view of the<br>
comonomer content and/or molecular weight.<br>
In any case the Polydispersity Index (PI) and/or the comonomer content of the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) as defined in the instant invention refer(s) to the total propylene copolymer<br>
(A) be it monomodal or multimodal, like bimodal.<br>
Further it is preferred that the propylene copolymer (A) has a rather low melt flow rate. The<br>
melt flow rate mainly depends on the average molecular weight. This is due to the fact that<br>
long molecules render the material a lower flow tendency than short molecules. An increase<br>
in molecular weight means a decrease in the MFR-value. The melt flow rate (MFR) is<br>
measured in g/10 min of the polymer discharged through a defined die under specified<br>
temperature and pressure conditions and the measure of viscosity of the polymer which, in<br>
turn, for each type of polymer is mainly influenced by its molecular weight but also by its<br>
degree of branching. The melt flow rate measured under a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C<br>
(ISO 1133) is denoted as MFR2 (230 °C).<br>
Thus it is required that propylene copolymer (A) has a melt flow rate (MFR2 (230 C)) equal<br>
or below 0.8 g/10min, more preferred of equal or less than 0.5 g/10min, still more preferred<br>
equal or less than 0.4 g/10min. On the other hand the MFR2 (230 °C) should be more than<br>
0.05 g/10min, more preferably more than 0.1 g/10min.<br>
In case the melt flow rate is measured under a load of 5 kg the following is preferred.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) has preferably a melt flow rate (MFR5 (230 C)) equal or<br>
below 4.0 g/l0min, more preferred of equal or less than 2.5 g/10min, still more preferred<br>
equal or less than 1.8 g/10min. On the other hand the MFR2 (230 °C) should be more than<br>
 <br>
0.1 g/10min. more preferably more than 0.3 g/10min. Accordingly a preferred range is from<br>
0.3 to 1.8g/10min.<br>
Additionally it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide pipes with<br>
a rather high resistance to deformation, i.e. have a high stiffness. Accordingly it is preferred<br>
that the propylene copolymer (A) in an injection moulded state and/or the pipes based on<br>
said material has(have) a flexural modulus measured according to ISO 178 of at least<br>
1000 MPa, more preferably of at least 1150 MPa.<br>
Furthermore it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide pipes<br>
having a rather high impact strength. Accordingly it is preferred that propylene copolymer<br>
(A) in an injection moulded state and/or the pipes based on said material has(have) an impact<br>
strength measured according the Charpy impact test (ISO 179 (leA)) at 23 °C of at least<br>
50.0 kJ/m2, more preferably of at least 53.0 U/m2, yet more preferably of at least 55.0 kJ/m2<br>
and/or an high impact strength measured according the Charpy impact test (ISO 179 (leA))<br>
at -20°C of at least 1.5 kJ/m2, more preferably of at least 2.0 kJ/m2, yet more preferably of at<br>
least 2.5 kJ/m2.<br>
The instant propylene copolymer (A) has been in particular developed to improve the<br>
properties of pipes, in particular in terms of very good slow crack propagation performance<br>
by keeping the other properties, like resistance to deformation and impact strength, on a high<br>
level. Thus the instant invention is also directed to the use of the propylene copolymer (A)<br>
for a pipe, like a pressure pipe, or for parts of a pipe, like a pressure pipe, and for the<br>
manufacture of pipes.<br>
In addition it is appreciated that the propylene copolymer (A) enables to provide pipes<br>
having a very good slow crack propagation performance. Thus it is preferred that the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) and/or the pipes based on said material has(have) a slow crack<br>
propagation performance measured according to the full notch creep test (FNCT) (ISO<br>
16770; at 80 °C and applied stress of 4.0 MPa) of at least 1200 h.<br>
 <br>
The propylene copolymer (A) may comprise - in addition to the P-nucleating agents - further<br>
additives, like fillers not interacting with the P-nucleating agents, e.g. mica and/or chalk<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is also directed to pipes and/or pipe fittings, in particular<br>
pressure pipes, comprising the propylene copolymer (A) as defined in the instant invention.<br>
These pipes, in particular pressure pipes, are in particular characterized by the flexural<br>
modulus, impact strength and slow crack propagation performance as defined in the previous<br>
paragraphs.<br>
The term "pipe" as used herein is meant to encompass hollow articles having a length greater<br>
than diameter. Moreover the term "pipe" shall also encompass supplementary parts like<br>
fittings, valves and all parts which are commonly necessary for e.g. a hot water piping<br>
system.<br>
Pipes according to the invention also encompass single and multilayer pipes, where for<br>
example one or more of the layers is a metal layer and which may include an adhesive layer.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) used for pipes according to the invention may contain usual<br>
auxiliary materials, e. g. up to 10 wt.-% fillers and/or 0.01 to 2.5 wt.-% stabilizers and/or<br>
0.01 to 1 wt.-% processing aids and/or 0.1 to 1 wt.-% antistatic agents and/or 0.2 to 3 wt.-%<br>
pigments and/or reinforcing agents, e. g. glass fibres, in each case based on the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) used (the wt.-% given in this paragraph refer to the total amount of the pipe<br>
and/or a pipe layer comprising said propylene copolymer (A)). In this respect, it has to be<br>
noted, however, that any of such of auxiliary materials which serve as highly active a-<br>
nucleating agents, such as certain pigments, are not utilized in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
The propylene copolymer (A) as defined above is preferably produced in the presence of the<br>
catalyst system as defined below. Furthermore, for the production of propylene copolymer<br>
(A) as defined above, the process as stated below is preferably used.<br>
 <br>
Thus the manufacture of the inventive propylene copolymer (A) comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	producing a propylene copolymer (A) as defined herein, preferably in a multistage<br>
process and subsequently<br>
(b)	treating the propylene copolymer (A) with a β-nucleating agent (B), preferably at<br>
temperatures in the range of 175 to 300 °C, and<br>
(c)	cooling and crystallizing the propylene copolymer (A) composition.<br>
In the following the process and the catalyst system employed therein will be described in<br>
more detail.<br>
The catalyst system used to obtain the propylene copolymer (A) according to this invention<br>
is defined as follows.<br>
A solid catalyst system comprising a<br>
(a)	an organo-zirconium compound of formula (I)<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
each " Li" can be the same or different and is an alkyl residue,<br>
each "L2" can be the same or different and is a substituted aromatic residue<br>
selected from the group consisting of<br>
 <br>
 <br>
"L3" is an alkyl residue,<br>
"Y" is a bridging group linking the indenyl ligands,<br>
"R1" and "R2" are organic residues,<br>
"X" is a ligand with a 0-bond to the zirconium (Zr),<br>
(b)	a cocatalyst (Co) comprising an element (E) of group 13 of the periodic table<br>
(IUPAC),<br>
wherein the catalyst system has a porosity of less than 1.40 ml/g measured according to<br>
DIN 66135 and/or a surface area of lower than 25 m2/g measured according to ISO 9277.<br>
Preferably this catalyst system for the preparation of the propylene copolymer (A) is itself<br>
polymerized thus obtaining a polymerized solid catalyst composition as defined in more<br>
detail below.<br>
It has been surprisingly found out that with this specific solid catalyst system successfully,<br>
i.e. with high productivity, the propylene copolymer (A) according to this invention is<br>
obtainable (see examples).<br>
Preferably the residues L1 and L2 of the indenyl rings of the organo-zirconium compound are<br>
identical.<br>
Further, the residue "L1" is preferably a C1 to C10 alkyl residue, more preferably a C1-C6<br>
alkyl residue, e.g. methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, still more preferably methyl or ethyl, i.e. methyl.<br>
The residues "L2" are substituted aromatic ring systems, preferably the residues "L2" are<br>
selected from the group consisting of substituted phenyl, substituted naphthyl and substituted<br>
anthracenyl. More specifically the residues "L2" are selected from the group consisting of<br>
 <br>
 <br>
wherein "L3" is an alkyl residue.<br>
More preferably the residue "L3" is a C1 to C10 alkyl residue, still more preferably the<br>
residue "L3" is a C1 to C6 alkyl residue, like methyl, ethyl iso-propyl, tert-butyl, 2-methyl-<br>
butyl. yet more preferably the "L3" is selected from the group consisting of iso-propyl, tert-<br>
butyl, 2-methyl-butyl, e.g. tert-butyl.<br>
Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the residues "L2" are a phenyl residues selected from<br>
the group consisting of<br>
 <br>
Most preferably the residues "L2" are 4-tert-butyl-phenyl.<br>
A further essential requirement is that the indenyl residues of the organo-zirconium<br>
compound are linked via a bridge. More specifically the two five member rings of the<br>
indenyl rings are linked together via a bridge. Preferably the residue "Y" is C, Si or Ge, more<br>
preferably Si. The residues "Ri" and "R2" of "Y" can be identical or different. However it is<br>
especially appreciated that the residues "R1" and "R2" are different.<br>
The residues "Rf and "R2" can independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to<br>
C20 alkyl. C1 to C20 cycloalkyl, C6 to C12 aryl, C7 to Cl2 arylalkyl, or trimethylsilyl. More<br>
 <br>
preferably the residues "R1" and "R2" are different and selecteted from the group consisting<br>
of C1 to C20 alkyl, C1 to C20 cycloalkyl, C6 to C12 aryl, C7 to C12 arylalkyl, or trimethylsilyl.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the residues "Ri" and "R2" are idenpendently selected from the<br>
group consisting of C1 to C2o alkyl and C1 to C20 cycloalkyl. Even more preferred the<br>
residues "R]" and "R2" are different and selected from the group consisting of C1 to C2o alkyl<br>
and C1 to C2o cycloalkyl. In a preferred embodiment "R1" is C1 to C2o alkyl, like methyl,<br>
ethyl or propyl, and "R2" is C1 to C20 cycloalkyl, like cyclohexyl or cyclohcptyl.<br>
The ligands "X" can independently be selected from the group consisting of hydrogen,<br>
halogen. C1 to C20 alkyl, C1 to C20 alkoxy, C2 to C20 alkenyl, C2 to C20 alkynyl,C3 to<br>
C12 cycloalkyl, C6 to C20 aryl, C6 to C20 aryloxy, C7 to C20 arylalkyl, C7 to C20<br>
arylalkenyl, -SR", -PR"3, -SiR"3, -OSiR"3 and -NR"2,<br>
wherein each R" is independently hydrogen, C1 to C20 alkyl, C2 to C20 alkenyl, C2 to C20<br>
alkynyl. C3 to C12 cycloalkyl or C6 to C20 aryl. In a preferred embodiments the ligands "X"<br>
are identical and either halogen, like CI, or benzyl.<br>
Considering the statements above, especially suitable for the preparation of a propylene<br>
copolymer (A) according to this invention is an organo-zirconium compound having the<br>
formula (II)<br>
 <br>
wherein "Y" is C, Ge, or Si, preferably Si.<br>
As a further requirement the solid catalyst system for the preparation of the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) according to this invention must comprise a cocatalyst (Co) comprising an<br>
 <br>
element (E) of group 13 of the periodic table (IUPAC), for instance the cocatalyst (Co)<br>
comprises a compound of Al.<br>
Examples of such cocatalyst (Co) are organo aluminium compounds, such as<br>
trialkylaluminium compound and/or aluminoxane compound.<br>
Aluminoxane cocatalysts are inter alia described in WO 94/28034 which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference. These are linear or cyclic oligomers of having up to 40, preferably 3 to<br>
20, -(Al (R"')O)- repeating units (wherein R"' is hydrogen, C1 to C10-alkyl (preferably<br>
methyl) or C6 to C18-aryl or mixtures thereof).<br>
Such compounds of Al, preferably aluminoxanes, can be used as the only compound in the<br>
cocatalyst (Co) or together with other cocatalyst compound(s). Thus besides or in addition to<br>
the compounds of Al, i.e. the aluminoxanes, other cation complex forming cocatalyst<br>
compounds, like boron compounds can be used. Said cocatalysts are commercially available<br>
or can be prepared according to the prior art literature. Preferably however in the<br>
manufacture of the solid catalyst system only compounds of Al as cocatalyst (Co) are<br>
employed.<br>
In particular preferred cocatalysts (Co) are the aluminoxanes, in particular the C1 to C10-<br>
alkylaluminoxanes, most particularly methylaluminoxane (MAO).<br>
Especially good results are achievable in case the mol ratio of element (E) of the cocatalyst<br>
(Co) and zirconium, preferably the mol ratio of Al of the cocatalyst (Co) and zirconium, are<br>
kept in a specific ratio. Accordingly it is appreciated that mol ratio of element (E) of the<br>
cocatalyst (Co) and zirconium [E/Zr], preferably the mol ratio of Al of the cocatalyst (Co)<br>
(like aluminoxanes, such as methylaluminumoxane (MAO)) and zirconium [Al/Zr], is in a<br>
range of 100 to 800 mol/mol, more preferably in a range of 150 to 600 mol/mol, yet more<br>
preferably in a range of 200 to 400 mol/mol, like 200 to 350mol/mol.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the organo-zirconium compound of formula (I) and the cocatalyst (Co) of the<br>
solid catalyst system represent at least 70 wt%, more preferably at least 80 wt%, even more<br>
preferably at least 90 wt%, even further preferably at least 95 wt% of the solid catalyst<br>
system. Thus it is appreciated that the solid catalyst system is featured by the fact that it is<br>
self-supported, i.e. it does not comprise any catalytically inert support material, like for<br>
instance silica, alumina or MgCl2 or porous polymeric material, which is otherwise<br>
commonly used in heterogeneous catalyst systems, i.e. the catalyst is not supported on<br>
external support or carrier material. As a consequence that the solid metallocene catalyst<br>
system is self-supported it has a rather low surface area.<br>
A low surface area is insofar appreciated as therewith the bulk density of the produced<br>
propylene copolymer (A) can be increased enabling a high throughput of material. Typically<br>
the solid catalyst system has a surface area measured according to the commonly known<br>
BET method with N2 gas as analysis adsorptive of less than 25 m2/g, more preferably of less<br>
than 20 m2/g, yet more preferably of less than 15 m2/g, still yet more preferably of less than<br>
10 m2/g. In some embodiments, the solid catalyst system used for the preparation of the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) shows a surface area of 5 m2/g or less, i.e. a surface area is below<br>
the detection limit.<br>
The solid catalyst system can be additionally or alternatively defined by the pore volume, i.e.<br>
porosity. Thus it is appreciated that the catalyst particle has a porosity of less than 1.40 ml/g,<br>
more preferably of less than 1.00 ml/g, still more preferably of less than 0.50 ml/g and even<br>
less than 0.20 ml/g. In another preferred embodiment the porosity is not detectable when<br>
determined with the method applied as defined in the example section.<br>
Moreover the solid catalyst system typically has a mean particle size of not more than<br>
500 μm, i.e. preferably in the range of 2 to 500 μm, more preferably 5 to 200 μm. It is in<br>
particular preferred that the mean particle size is below 80 μm, still more preferably below<br>
70 μm. A preferred range for the mean particle size is 5 to 70 μm, more preferred 10 to<br>
60 μm.<br>
 <br>
The solid metallocene catalyst system is preferably obtained by the emulsion solidification<br>
technology as described in WO 03/051934. This document is herewith included in its<br>
entirety by reference.<br>
Hence the solid catalyst system is preferably obtainable by a process by converting a<br>
solution (A) comprising the organo-zirconium compound and the cocatalyst (Co) to solid<br>
particles comprising the steps of<br>
(a)	generating a liquid/liquid emulsion by dispersing the solution (A) in a solvent (S)<br>
immiscible with said solution (A), wherein<br>
(i) the solvent (S) constitutes the continuous phase of the emulsion and<br>
(ii) the solution (A) constitutes in form of droplets the dispersed phase of the<br>
emulsion,<br>
(iii) the organo-zirconium compound and the cocatalyst (Co) are present in the<br>
droplets, and<br>
(b)	solidifying said dispersed phase to convert said droplets to solid particles.<br>
More precisely the solid catalyst system is preferably obtainable by a process comprising the<br>
steps of<br>
(a)	preparing a solution (A) of the components of the solid catalyst system, wherein the<br>
solution (A) comprises at least a solvent (A'), the organo-zirconium compound and<br>
the cocatalyst (Co) as defined in the instant invention,<br>
(b)	dispersing said solution (A) in a solvent (B) immiscible therewith and optionally in<br>
the presence of a surfactant (S) to form an emulsion in which said components are<br>
present in the droplets of the dispersed phase, and<br>
(c)	solidifying said dispersed phase to convert said droplets to solid particles and<br>
recovering said particles to obtain said solid catalyst system.<br>
Preferably an organic solvent (A') is used to form said solution (A). Still more preferably the<br>
organic solvent (A') is selected from the group consisting of a linear alkane, cyclic alkane,<br>
linear alkene, cyclic alkene, aromatic hydrocarbon, like toluene, and halogen-containing<br>
 <br>
hydrocarbon. Toluene is in particular preferred as a solvent (A') to form the solution (A)<br>
with the components of the solid catalyst system.<br>
Moreover the immiscible solvent (B) forming the continuous phase is an inert solvent, more<br>
preferably the immiscible solvent (B) comprises a fluorinated organic solvent and/or a<br>
functionalized derivative thereof, still more preferably the immiscible solvent (B) comprises<br>
a semi-, highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbon and/or a functionalized derivative thereof. It<br>
is in particular preferred, that said immiscible solvent (B) comprises a perfluorohydrocarbon<br>
or a functionalized derivative thereof, preferably C3 to C30 perfluoroalkanes, -alkenes or -<br>
cycloalkanes, more preferred C4 to C10 perfluoro-alkanes, -alkenes or -cycloalkanes,<br>
particularly preferred perfluorohexane, perfluoroheptane, perfluorooctane or perfluoro<br>
(methylcyclohexane) or a mixture thereof.<br>
Perfluorinated hydrocarbon denotes a hydrocarbon compound, where all hydrogen atoms are<br>
replaced with fluorine atom. Highly fluorinated hydrocarbon denotes a hydrocarbon<br>
compound, where at least half of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atom.<br>
Furthermore it is preferred that the emulsion comprising said continuous phase and said<br>
dispersed phase is a bi-or multiphasic system as known in the art.<br>
A surfactant can be used for forming the emulsion. After the formation of the emulsion<br>
system, said catalyst is formed in situ from catalyst components in said solution.<br>
In principle, the surfactant may be any suitable agent which contributes to the formation<br>
and/or stabilization of the emulsion and which does not have any adverse effect on the<br>
catalytic activity of the catalyst. The surfactant is based on hydrocarbons optionally<br>
interrupted with (a) heteroatom(s), preferably halogenated hydrocarbons optionally having a<br>
functional group, preferably semi-, highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbons as known in the<br>
art, e.g. (2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,-heptadecafluoronoyl)oxirane.<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, the surfactant may be prepared during the emulsion preparation, e.g. by<br>
reacting a surfactant precursor with a compound of the catalyst solution. Said surfactant<br>
precursor may be a halogenated hydrocarbon with at least one functional group, e.g. a highly<br>
fluorinated C1 to C30 alcohol, (such as C4 - C2o, or C5 - C10 alcohol, like heptanol, octanol or<br>
nonanol). For instance in preferred embodiments 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,-<br>
dodecafluoroheptanol and 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,9-heptadecafluorononylnonanol are<br>
is used as a surfactant precursors.<br>
Suitable processes for dispersing the solution (A) within the solvent (B) is the use of<br>
mechanical as well as of ultrasound for mixing, as known to the skilled person. The process<br>
parameters, such as time of mixing, intensity of mixing, type of mixing, power employed for<br>
mixing, such as mixer velocity or wavelength of ultrasound employed, viscosity of solvent<br>
phase, are used for adjusting the size of the solid catalyst system.<br>
In principle any solidification method can be used for forming the solid catalyst system from<br>
the dispersed droplets. According to one preferable embodiment the solidification is effected<br>
by a temperature change treatment. Hence the emulsion subjected to gradual temperature<br>
change of up to 10 °C/min, preferably 0.5 to 6 °C/min and more preferably 1 to 5 °C/min.<br>
Even more preferred the emulsion is subjected to a rapid temperature change of more than<br>
35 °C. preferably more than 40 °C. Depending on the type and size of the apparatus the<br>
temperature change can vary, e.g. within less than 10 seconds, preferably less than 6<br>
seconds.<br>
For further details, embodiments and examples of the continuous and dispersed phase<br>
system, emulsion formation method, and solidification methods reference is made e.g. to the<br>
above cited international patent application WO 03/051934.<br>
It has been additionally discovered that further improvement in the preparation of the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) can be achieved in case the solid catalyst system is protected<br>
against the reaction medium used for instance in slurry reactors. A protection of the solid<br>
catalyst system reduces sheeting in the reactor vessel and thus increases the output rate and<br>
 <br>
the properties of the produced propylene copolymer (A). An effective protection can be<br>
accomplished in case the solid catalyst system is polymerized. Thus it is in particular<br>
appreciated that in the preparation of the propylene copolymer (A) a solid catalyst<br>
composition is employed, said solid catalyst composition comprises a polymer matrix and<br>
distributed therein a catalyst system as defined in detail above, wherein the weight ratio of<br>
the polymer matrix and the catalyst system [weight polymer matrix/weight catalyst system]<br>
in the solid catalyst composition is below 25.0.<br>
The solid catalyst composition is in particular featured by the fact the catalyst systems is<br>
dispersed in a polymeric matrix material, i.e. the catalyst system is distributed within the<br>
polymer matrix. The term "distributed" shall preferably indicate that the catalyst system is<br>
not concentrated at one place within the matrix but (evenly) dispersed within the matrix. This<br>
has the advantage that - contrary to commercially available supported catalyst systems -an<br>
overheating at the beginning of the polymerization process due to "hot spots" areas caused<br>
by concentration of catalytic species at one place is diminished which in turn supports a start<br>
of the polymerization in a controlled way under mild conditions. The even distribution of<br>
catalyst system in the polymer matrix is mainly achieved due to the preparation of the solid<br>
catalyst composition as described in detail below. One remarkable feature of the process<br>
defined in detail below is that the catalyst composition is obtained by heterogeneous<br>
catalysis.<br>
As stated above the polymer matrix of solid catalyst composition shall protect the catalytic<br>
active species within the solid catalyst composition against any possible dissolution<br>
phenomena in a slurry reactor, i.e. in low molar mass hydrocarbons, like propane, i-butane,<br>
pentane, hexane or propylene. On the other hand the protection of the catalyst system should<br>
be not too massive otherwise the catalytic activity of the active species might be deteriorated.<br>
In the present invention the conflicting interests one the one hand of high catalytic activity of<br>
the catalyst system and on the other hand of the solid stability of the catalyst system in the<br>
polymerization medium of the slurry reactor is achieved by protecting the catalyst system by<br>
a matrix wherein the matrix is present in rather low amounts within the solid catalyst<br>
composition. It has been surprisingly found out that a rather low weight ratio of polymer<br>
 <br>
matrix to solid catalyst system [weight polymer matrix/weight solid catalyst system], leads to<br>
a satisfactory protection against dissolution by keeping the catalyst activity on high levels.<br>
Accordingly it is appreciated that the weight ratio of the solid composition [weight polymer<br>
matrix/weight solid catalyst system] is below 25.0, more preferably below 15.0, yet more<br>
preferably below 10.0, still yet more preferably below 5.0. On the other hand to achieve a<br>
reasonable protection against dissolution the polymerization degree shall preferably exceed a<br>
value of 0.5, more preferably of 0.7, yet more preferably of 1.0. Preferred ranges of the<br>
polymerization degree shall be 0.7 to 10.0, more preferably 1.0 to 8.0, yet more preferably<br>
1.0 to 6.0. still more preferably 1.0 to 5.0, still yet more preferably of 2.0 to 5.0.<br>
The polymer matrix can be any type of polymer as long as it prevents the dissolution of the<br>
catalyst system in the polymerization medium of a slurry reactor, i.e. low molar mass<br>
hydrocarbons, like propane, i-butane, pentane, hexane or propylene, and is catalytically inert.<br>
Accordingly the polymer matrix is preferably based on olefin monomers, like a-olefin<br>
monomers, each having 2 to 20 carbon atoms. The olefin, like a-olefin, can be linear or<br>
branched, cyclic or acyclic, aromatic or aliphatic. Preferred examples are ethylene,<br>
propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 1-hexene, 2-methyl-<br>
1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 2-ethyl-l-butene, 2,3-dimethyl-l-<br>
butene. 1-octene, styrene, and vinylcyclohexane.<br>
It is in particular preferred that the polymer matrix corresponds to the propylene copolymer<br>
(A) according to the present invention.<br>
Further it is appreciated that the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer<br>
matrix is rather low. Thus it is preferred that the polymer matrix has weight average<br>
molecular weight (Mw) of below or equal 300,000 g/mol, more preferably below 50,000<br>
g/mol. In preferred embodiments the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the polymer<br>
matrix is in the range of 3,000 to 30,000 g/mol, more preferably in the range of 5,000 to<br>
20.000 g/mol.<br>
 <br>
Concerning the indenyl ligands and/or the bridging groups (Y) of the organo-zirconium<br>
compound as defined in detail above it is preferred that do not form a chemical entity with<br>
the polymer matrix. Thus it is in particular preferred that the indenyl ligands and/or the<br>
bridging groups (Y) do not comprise a polymerizable residue. A polymerizable residue<br>
according to this invention is any functional group which enables the covalent bonding of the<br>
organo-zirconium compound via the indenyl ligands and/or the bridging groups (Y) with the<br>
polymer matrix. Accordingly it is in particular preferred that the indenyl ligands and/or the<br>
bridging groups (Y) of the organo-zirconium compound as defined in the instant invention<br>
do not comprise polymerizable olefinic groups, like olefinically unsaturated substituents.<br>
Examples of such polymerizable olefinic groups are substituents having the formula (III)<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
R" is a hydrocarbyl diradical having 1 to 20 carbon atoms; more preferably 2 to 10,<br>
n is 1 or 0, and<br>
each R' is individually selected from the group consisting of organo radicals having 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms and hydrogen.<br>
Most preferably R" has at least two carbons in its main alkylene chain, i.e. it is a divalent<br>
ethylene radical or a higher homolog thereof.<br>
Accordingly it is in particular preferred that of the indenyl ligands and/or the bridging groups<br>
(Y) do not comprise polymerizable olefinic groups having the formula (III).<br>
As a consequence of the previous paragraph it is preferred that the polymer matrix is not<br>
covalent bonded to the organo-zirconium compound via the indenyl ligands and/or the<br>
bridging groups (Y).<br>
The solid catalyst composition as preferably used in the instant invention is preferably as<br>
follows obtained.<br>
 <br>
The solid catalyst composition is produced by polymerizing olefin monomers, like a-olefins,<br>
in the presence of the above defined solid catalyst system, i.e. preferably in the presence of a<br>
self-supported solid catalyst system comprising an organo-zirconium compound of formula<br>
(I) and a cocatalyst (Co). Thus the polymerization is a heterogeneous polymerization. As a<br>
consequence of the polymerization process the catalyst system will be dispersed in the<br>
growing polymer matrix. To avoid an overheating during the polymerization and a<br>
dissolving of the catalyst system the polymerization is run preferably in a diluent.<br>
Accordingly the process for the preparation of the solid catalyst composition comprises the<br>
steps of<br>
(a)	forming in a vessel a catalyst diluent slurry comprising the catalyst system as defined<br>
in detail above and a diluent,<br>
(b)	feeding at least one olefin monomer, preferably at least one a-olefin monomer, into<br>
the vessel,<br>
(c)	operating the vessel under such conditions that the at least one olefin monomer is<br>
polymerized by the catalyst system, producing thereby a solid catalyst composition<br>
comprising a polymer matrix in which the catalyst system is dispersed,<br>
(d)	terminating the polymerization of step (c) before the weight ratio of the polymer<br>
matrix and the catalyst system [weight polymer matrix (A)/weight catalyst system]<br>
in the solid catalyst composition is 25.0 or more.<br>
Preferred is that the termination of the polymerization of step (c) is accomplished so that the<br>
weight ratio of the polymer matrix and the catalyst system [weight polymer matrix/weight<br>
catalyst system] in the solid catalyst composition is from 0.5 to 10.0, more preferably from<br>
1.0 to 8.0, yet more preferably from 1.0 to 6.0, still more preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 and still<br>
yet more preferably of from 2.0 to 5.0.<br>
The vessel used in the manufacture of the present invention is preferably stirred well in order<br>
to facilitate the dissolution of the gaseous monomer and keeping the monomer concentration<br>
constant in the oil.<br>
 <br>
The diluent to be used must be inert towards the catalyst. This means that it must preferably<br>
not contain components having tendency to react with the catalyst system, such as groups<br>
containing atoms selected from oxygen, sulphur, nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine<br>
and so on. Also groups containing double bonds or triple bonds should be avoided.<br>
Especially the presence of compounds like water, alcohols, organic sulphides, ketones,<br>
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and acetylenic compounds should be avoided.<br>
Examples of useful diluents are oils, like hydrocarbon oil or silicon oil, more preferably<br>
hydrocarbon oil, or fluorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
It is in particular preferred that said diluents contain less than 100 parts per million (ppm) of<br>
compounds containing groups as mentioned in the previous paragraph. More preferably the<br>
content of such compounds is less than 50 ppm, still more preferably less than 10 ppm, yet<br>
more preferably below the detection limit.<br>
The viscosity of the oil during the catalyst polymerisation into the matrix can be within<br>
reasonable broad ranges. As preferably the reaction mixture is stirred during this step,<br>
settling is of no problem, even if low viscosity oils are used. After the desired catalyst<br>
composition of polymer matrix and catalyst system is obtained, the catalyst composition-oil<br>
slurry should be readily transportable into the polymerisation reactor. If desired, the viscosity<br>
of the slurry can be adjusted, i.e. increased afterwards by adding some more viscous<br>
material, e.g. grease, like vaseline into the system. The optimal viscosity of the catalyst<br>
composition-oil-slurry depends on the catalyst feeding systems in the process. If the<br>
viscosity will be kept too low, it might cause some settling problems during any storage<br>
time. However, if stirring systems are in use, this is not a problem. Very high viscosities of<br>
the slurry require special dosing systems.<br>
Thus it is appreciated that the dynamic viscosity of the oil is from 5 to 3000 mPa.s at the<br>
operating temperature of the vessel, more preferably at temperature range from room-<br>
temperature (20 °C) to 70 °C. Preferably the dynamic viscosity is from 10 to 1500 mPa.s,<br>
 <br>
more preferably from 20 to 990 mPa.s, when measured at the operating temperature of the<br>
vessel, more preferably at temperature range from room-temperature to 70 °C.<br>
Moreover it is appreciated that the oil, preferably in case white oil is used, has density<br>
measured according to DIN EN ISO 12185 from 750 to 900 kg/m3.<br>
Additionally it is preferred that the solubility of the catalyst system within the oil is rather<br>
low. Thus the oil shall be preferably selected in such a manner that the catalyst system has a<br>
solubility in the oil [amount of catalyst system solved in 100 g oil] below 0.1 g. I.e. catalyst<br>
system is dissolved not more than 0.1 wt-%, preferable less than 0.08 wt-%.<br>
Examples of suitable oils are mineral oils and synthetic oils comprising essentially<br>
hydrocarbons containing from about 15 to about 100 carbon atoms, like Synton PAO 100,<br>
which is a synthetic oil supplied by Crompton Petroleum Additives, Shell Cassida HF 15,<br>
Shell Cassida HF 32, Shell Cassida 46, Shell Cassida HF 68 and Shell Cassida HF 100,<br>
which are synthetic oils supplied by Shell, Drakeol 35, which is a synthetic oil supplied by<br>
Penreco. Ondina 68, which is a mineral oil supplied by Shell and Primol 352, which is<br>
supplied by ExxonMobil. From the commercial products in particular Primol products, like<br>
Primol 352, are preferred.<br>
If fluorinatcd hydrocarbon component(s) are used as diluent they can be used individually or<br>
as mixtures, and can be included in a mixture with non-fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds<br>
if desired, however, preferably fluorinated hydrocarbons are used alone.<br>
The fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds have at least one carbon atom and at least one<br>
fluorine atom The fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds can be perfluorinated hydrocarbon<br>
compounds or the fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds can optionally include one or more<br>
hydrogen atom(s). A perfluorinated hydrocarbon compound is a fluorocarbon compound in<br>
which the hydrogen directly attached to the carbon atom(s) is completely replaced by<br>
fluorine. See Hawley 's Condensed Chemical Dictionary, Thirteenth Edition, Van Nostrand<br>
 <br>
Renhold, 1997. Examples of preferred perfluorocarbons include linear branched or cyclic, C1 to C40 perfluoroalkanes.<br>
In one embodiment, the fluorinated hydrocarbon compounds are represented by the formula<br>
(V)<br>
CxHyFz	(V)<br>
wherein x is an integer from 1 to 40, preferably from 4 to 30, more preferably from 4 to 20,<br>
yet more preferably from 1 to 10, like from 4 to 6, wherein<br>
y is greater than or equal to 0, and<br>
z is an integer and at least one,<br>
more preferably y and z are integers and at least one.<br>
In a preferred embodiment z is 4 or more.<br>

Raymond Will. et. al., CEH Marketing Report, Fluorocarbons, Pages 1- 133, by the<br>
Chemical Economics Handbook-SRI International, April 2001, which is fully incorporated<br>
herein by reference, are included.<br>
In a particular preferred embodiments the fluorinated hydrocarbon compound is selected<br>
from the group consisting of perfluorinated C1 to C15 alkane, perfluorodecalin,<br>
perfluoroheptane, perfluorohexane, perfluoromethylcyclohexane, perfluorooctane, perfluoro-<br>
1.3-dimethylcyclohexane, perfluorononane and perfluorotoluene. The most preferred<br>
fluorinated hydrocarbon compound is perfluoro-l,3-dimethylcyclohexane.<br>
 <br>
Most preferably the fluorinated hydrocarbon compound is perfluoro-1,3-<br>
dimethylcyclohexane.<br>
The diluent slurry may be formed in any method known in the art. According to a preferred<br>
method, the solid catalyst system is introduced into the diluent under agitation. The slurry<br>
may be prepared in the vessel or it may be prepared in advance and then transferred into the<br>
vessel. Further, the solid catalyst system may also be delivered into the vessel as<br>
concentrated slurry, which may then be diluted with the diluent in the vessel.<br>
The diluent slurry may be homogenised by agitation. The agitation can be obtained by<br>
circulating the diluent slurry by using a circulation pump and pipes connecting the pump to<br>
the vessel. Alternatively, the vessel is equipped with an agitator, which keeps the diluent<br>
slurry within the vessel in motion, and facilitates the dissolution of gaseous monomer into<br>
the diluent. Preferably the vessel is equipped with an agitator. The elements of the agitator<br>
should be chosen so that uniform stirring in the whole volume of the vessel is obtained and<br>
no dead spots where the catalyst system could settle exist. These stirrer elements, such as<br>
anchor type elements and axial and radial impellers are well known in the art and a person<br>
skilled in the art can choose a suitable combination for each geometry of the vessel. The<br>
vessel may also be equipped with baffles, which are known in the art to further improve the<br>
stirring.<br>
As monomers preferably olefins, like a-olefins, are employed. More preferably the olefins,<br>
like a-olefins, have 2 to 20 carbon atoms. The olefins, like a-olefins, can be linear or<br>
branched, cyclic or acyclic, aromatic or aliphatic. Preferred examples are ethylene,<br>
propylene. 1-butene, 1-pentene, 2-methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 1-hexene, 2-methyl-<br>
1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl- 1-pentene, 2-ethyl-l-butene, 2,3-dimethyl-l-<br>
butene, 1-octene, slyrene, and vinylcyclohexane. Most preferably the monomer is propylene.<br>
The temperature of the slurry within the vessel during polymerization in step (c) depends on<br>
the catalyst system used as well as on the monomers chosen. Thus it is appreciated that the<br>
reaction temperature is equal or below 70 °C, more preferably below 65 °C. Of course also<br>
 <br>
to loo low temperatures might cause problems because the viscosity might be too high then.<br>
Thus the temperature may be selected from the range of from -30 to 70 °C, more preferably<br>
from 0 to 65 °C, yet more preferably from 20 to 55 °C.<br>
The pressure within the vessel at step (c) of the polymerization process shall be kept in a<br>
certain range. It is desired that the pressure in the vessel is higher than the atmospheric<br>
pressure to minimise the eventual leaks of air and/or moisture into the catalyst feed vessel.<br>
Thus it is appreciated that the pressure is in the range of at least 0.2 to 15 bar, more<br>
preferably in the range of 1 to 10 bar, even more preferred in the range of 2.5 to 8 bar.<br>
The vessel shall be maintained in inert atmosphere. Especially, the presence of oxygen and<br>
moisture should be avoided.<br>
The gas phase in the vessel should preferably consist of nitrogen, argon and similar inert<br>
gases, or their mixtures. Also, the vessel should be equipped with possibility to flush the<br>
vessel with inert gas, preferably with nitrogen. Of course in addition to the used monomers,<br>
in gaseous form, also hydrogen, used as molecular weight controlling agent is preferably fed<br>
into the vessel.<br>
After the desired polymerization degree the polymerization is terminated (step (d)). The<br>
termination is preferably achieved by degassing the vessel.<br>
After the termination of the polymerization the oil slurry preferably comprises at least<br>
20 wt.-%, more preferably up to 25 wt.-% of the produced solid catalyst composition.<br>
Preferably, the oil slurry is removed from the vessel after the termination of the<br>
polymerization process. The thus obtained solid catalyst composition can be, if desired,<br>
extracted from the oil. However, it is also possible to use the prepared catalyst composition-<br>
oil slurry as such in the polymerisation process as defined in more detail below, without any<br>
extraction or drying steps.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly the present invention is also directed to a process for the preparation of the<br>
propylene copolymer (A) according to this invention comprising the steps of<br>
(a)	optionally polymerizing a solid catalyst system to a solid catalyst composition, and<br>
(b)	polymerizing in the presence of said solid catalyst system or said solid catalyst<br>
composition propylene, 1-butene and optionally ethylene and/or C5 to C10 α-<br>
olefin(s) obtaining a propylene copolymer according to this invention as defined in<br>
detail above.<br>
Preferably the polymerization step (b) is conducted in a reactor system comprising at least<br>
one slurry rector, preferably at least one loop reactor, and/or at least one gas phase rector. It<br>
is in particular appreciated that the preparation of the polypropylene is conducted in a<br>
multistage polymerization, i.e. the polypropylene is first polymerized in the slurry reactor<br>
and subsequently in at least one further slurry reactor and/or at least one gas phase reactor.<br>
Even more preferably the polypropylene is produced first in a slurry reactor, i.e. loop reactor,<br>
and subsequently in at least one gas phase reactor, preferably in one or two gas phase<br>
reactors.<br>
A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as developed by Borealis<br>
(known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in patent literature, such as in<br>
EP 0887 379 or EP 517 868.<br>
Optionally, the process can further comprise a prepolymerisation step in a manner known in<br>
the field, which prepolymerisation step may precede the first actual polymerization step and<br>
may be in particular suitable in case the solid catalyst system as such is intended to be used<br>
in the polymerization process.<br>
If the polypropylene composition is multimodal at least with respect to the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD), then the lower molecular weight (LMW) component and the higher<br>
molecular weight (HMW) component are made in different steps (b1) and (b2), in any order.<br>
The LMW fraction is preferably component (i) produced in step (bl) and the HMW fraction<br>
 <br>
is component (ii) which is produced in a subsequent step (b2) in the presence of component<br>
(i) as obtained from the first reactor (step (b1)).<br>
The process of the invention is preferably a continuous process.<br>
Temperature conditions in the reactor system for producing the propylene copolymer (A) is<br>
in the range of 40°C to 130°C, more preferably in the range of 50 to 110 °C.<br>
Therefore the conditions for the slurry reactor, preferably loop reactor, of step (bl) may be as<br>
follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 40°C to 110°C, preferably between 60°C and<br>
100°C or 70 to 95°C,<br>
the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 30 bar to 60<br>
bar.<br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se<br>
the residence time is typically 0.5 to 5 hours, e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours.<br>
In gas phase reactor (step (b2)) the conditions are preferably as follows:<br>
the temperature is within the range of 50°C to 130°C, preferably between 60°C and<br>
100 °C,<br>
the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to 35 bar,<br>
hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se,<br>
the residence time is typically 1 to 8 hours.<br>
The gas phase polymerisation may be conducted in a manner known in the art, such as in a<br>
fluidised bed or in an agitated bed. Also fast fluidisation may be utilised.<br>
The amount of propylene, 1-butene and optionally ethylene and/or C5 to C10 α-olefin(s) fed<br>
during the total process depends very much on the desired end product. The same applies for<br>
hydrogen feed, temperature and pressure used in the polymerization steps (b1) to (b2) as<br>
long as the above predefined ranges are considered. This exact amount and ratios needed for<br>
 <br>
the polymerization of the respective polypropylene can be easily determined by a person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Scavengers can be also used in the polymerization. As catalyst scavengers Al compounds,<br>
like Al alkyl compounds, e.g. triethyl aluminium, and tri-i-butyl aluminium are used.<br>
Preferably in the polymerization of the polypropylene (steps (bl) and (b2)) an antifouling<br>
composition can be fed. The antifouling composition according to this invention comprises<br>
an organic compound which has at least 14 carbon atoms and comprises at least one polar<br>
functional group.<br>
Preferably, the polar functional group is selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl<br>
including phenolic groups, carboxylic acid, ketone, aldehyde, ester, ether, thioether, amine,<br>
epoxy. thiol, or any combination thereof.<br>
Preferably, the organic compound comprises a hydrocarbyl group having at least 5 carbon<br>
atoms. In a preferred embodiment, the hydrocarbyl group having at least 5 carbon atoms is<br>
selected from linear or branched C10 to C22 hydrocarbyl groups, which may optionally<br>
include one or more carbon-carbon double bonds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the organic compound may comprise at least one substituted or<br>
unsubstituted cyclic moiety having at least 5 ring atoms. Preferably, said cyclic moiety is a<br>
tetrahydrofuranyl ring having at least one, preferably two hydroxyl groups attached to the<br>
ring.<br>
Preferably, the organic compound is selected from sterically hindered phenols, ethoxylated<br>
amines, ethoxylated amides, sorbitan ester compounds, thioether compounds, or mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
 <br>
Preferably, the sorbitan ester is a sorbitan C8 to C2o fatty acid ester. More preferably, the<br>
sorbitan fatty acid ester is selected from sorbitan stearate, sorbitan monooleate, or mixtures<br>
thereof<br>
After the polymerization the propylene copolymer (A) is blended with the p-nucleating agent<br>
(B) as defined above to obtain the propylene copolymer (A). The mixing can be carried out<br>
by methods known per se, e.g. by mixing the propylene copolymer (A) with the P-nucleating<br>
agent (B) in the desired weight relationship using a batch or a continuous process. As<br>
examples of typical batch mixers the Banbury and the heated roll mill can be mentioned.<br>
Continuous mixers are exemplified by the Farrel mixer, the Buss co-kneader, and single- or<br>
twin-screw extruders.<br>
In case pipes shall be produced of the propylene copolymer (A) than after the manufacture of<br>
the inventive material the following steps follow. In general the inventive propylene<br>
copolymer (A) is extruded and subsequently formed into a pipe.<br>
Accordingly the inventive pipe is preferably produced by first plasticizing the propylene<br>
copolymer (A) of the instant invention in an extruder at temperatures in the range of from<br>
200 to 300 °C and then extruding it through an annular die and cooling it.<br>
The extruders for producing the pipe can be single screw extruders with an L/D of 20 to 40<br>
or twin screw extruders or extruder cascades of homogenizing extruders (single screw or<br>
twin screw). Optionally, a melt pump and/or a static mixer can be used additionally between<br>
the extruder and the ring die head. Ring shaped dies with diameters ranging from<br>
approximately 16 to 2000 mm and even greater are possible.<br>
The melt arriving from the extruder is first distributed over an annular cross-section via<br>
conically arranged holes and then fed to the core/die combination via a coil distributor or<br>
screen. If necessary, restrictor rings or other structural elements for ensuring uniform melt<br>
flow may additionally be installed before the die outlet. After leaving the annular die, the<br>
 <br>
pipe is taken off over a calibrating mandrel, usually accompanied by cooling of the pipe by<br>
air cooling and/or water cooling, optionally also with inner water cooling.<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail by the examples provided<br>
below.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Definitions/Measuring Methods<br>
The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the above general<br>
description of the invention as well as to the below examples unless otherwise defined.<br>
Melting temperature and degree of crystallinity<br>
Melting temperature Tm, crystallization temperature Tcr, and the degree of crystallinity were<br>
measured with Mettler TA820 differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on 5 to 10 mg,<br>
typically 8±0.5 mg samples Both crystallization and melting curves were obtained during<br>
10°C/min cooling and heating scans between 30°C and 225°C. Melting and crystallization<br>
temperatures were taken as the peaks of endotherms and exotherms. The degree of<br>
crystallinity was calculated by comparison with heat of fusion of a perfectly crystalline<br>
polypropylene, i.e. 209 J/g.<br>
Randomness<br>
In the FTIR measurements, films of 250 -mm thickness were compression moulded at<br>
225 °C and investigated on a Perkin-Elmer System 2000 FTIR instrument. The ethylene<br>
peak area (760-700 cm-1) was used as a measure of total ethylene content. The absorption<br>
band for the structure -P-E-P- (one ethylene unit between propylene units), occurs at 733<br>
cm-1 This band characterizes the random ethylene content. For longer ethylene sequences<br>
(more than two units), an absorption band occurs at 720 cm-1. Generally, a shoulder<br>
corresponding to longer ethylene runs is observed for the random copolymers. The<br>
calibration for total ethylene content based on the area and random ethylene (PEP) content<br>
based on peak height at 733 cm-1 was made by 13C-NMR. (Thermochimica Acta, 66 (1990)<br>
53-68).<br>
 <br>
Number average molecular weight (M„), weight average molecular weight (Mw) and<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD) are determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography<br>
(GPC) according to the following method:<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight distribution (MWD =<br>
Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is the weight average<br>
molecular weight) is measured by a method based on ISO 16014-1:2003 and ISO 16014-<br>
4:2003. A Waters Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument, equipped with refractive index detector<br>
and online viscosimeter was used with 3 x TSK-gel columns (GMHXL-HT) from TosoHaas<br>
and 1.2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 200 mg/L 2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-<br>
phenol) as solvent at 145 °C and at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. 216.5 uL of sample<br>
solution were injected per analysis. The column set was calibrated using relative calibration<br>
with 19 narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 0.5 kg/mol to 11 500<br>
kg/mol and a set of well characterised broad polypropylene standards. All samples were<br>
prepared by dissolving 5 -10 mg of polymer in 10 mL (at 160 °C) of stabilized TCB (same<br>
as mobile phase) and keeping for 3 hours with continuous shaking prior sampling in into the<br>
GPC instrument.<br>
Rheology: Dynamic rheological measurements were carried out with Rheometrics RDA-II<br>
QC on compression molded samples under nitrogen atmosphere at 200°C using 25 mm -<br>
diameter plate and plate geometry. The oscillatory shear experiments were done within the<br>
linear viscoelastic range of strain at frequencies from 0.01 to 500 rad/s. (IS06721-1)<br>
The values of storage modulus (G), loss modulus (G"), complex modulus (G*) and complex<br>
viscosity (n*) were obtained as a function of frequency (ω).<br>
The Zero shear viscosity (n0) was calculated using complex fluidity defined as the reciprocal<br>
of complex viscosity. Its real and imaginary part are thus defined by<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The polydispersity index, PI, is calculated from cross-over point of G'(ω) and G"(ω).<br>
There is a linear correlation between f and f' with zero ordinate value of 1 /η0 (Heino et al.1 )<br>
For polypropylene this is valid at low frequencies and five first points (5 points/decade) are<br>
used in calculation of η0<br>
Shear thinning indexes (SHI), which are correlating with MWD and are independent of<br>
MW, were calculated according to Heino 1'2) (below).<br>
SHI<br>
SHI is calculated by dividing the Zero Shear Viscosity by a complex viscosity value,<br>
obtained at a certain constant shear stress value, G*. The abbreviation, SHI (0/50), is the<br>
ratio between the zero shear viscosity and the viscosity at the shear stress of 50 000 Pa.<br>

NMR-spectroscopy measurements:<br>
The l3C-NMR spectra of polypropylenes were recorded on Bruker 400MHz spectrometer at<br>
130 °C from samples dissolved in l,2,4-trichlorobenzene/benzene-d6 (90/10 w/w). For the<br>
pentad analysis the assignment is done according to the methods described in literature: (T.<br>
Hayashi. Y. Inoue, R. Chiijo, and T. Asakura, Polymer 29 138-43 (1988).and Chujo R, et al,<br>
Polymer 35 339 (1994).<br>
The NMR-measurement was used for determining the mmmm pentad concentration in a<br>
manner well known in the art.<br>
Melt Flow Rate (MFR2)<br>
The melt flow rates were measured with a load of 2.16 kg at 230 °C. The melt flow rate is<br>
that quantity of polymer in grams which the test apparatus standardized to ISO 1133<br>
extrudes within 10 minutes at a temperature of 230 °C under a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
 <br>
Comonomer content<br>
The comonomer contents of the copolymer was determined by quantitative Fourier transform<br>
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) calibrated to results obtained from quantitative C NMR<br>
spectroscopy.<br>
Thin films were pressed to a thickness of between 300 to 500 μm at 190 °C and spectra<br>
recorded in transmission mode. Relevant instrument settings include a spectral window of<br>
5000 to 400 wave-numbers (cm1), a resolution of 2.0 cm-1 and 8 scans.<br>
The butene content of a propylene-butene copolymer was determined using the baseline<br>
corrected peak maxima of a quantitative band at 767 cm-1, with the baseline defined from<br>
780-750 cm-1.<br>
The 1-butene content of a propylene-butene copolymer was determined using the baseline<br>
corrected peak maxima of a quantitative band at 727 cm-1, with the baseline defined from<br>
758.5 to 703.0 cm-1)<br>
The comonomer content(C) was determined using a film thickness method using the<br>
intensity of the quantitative band l(q) and the thickness of the pressed film T using the<br>
following relationship: f I(q) / T ]m + c = C where m and c are the coefficients determined<br>
from the calibration curve constructed using the comonomer contents obtained from 13C<br>
NMR spectroscopy.<br>
Content of β-modification:<br>
The β-crystallinity is determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC is run<br>
according to ISO 3146/ part 3 /method C2 with a scan rate of 10 °C/min. The amount of β-<br>
modification is calculated from the second heat by the following formula:<br>
β-area/(a-area + β-area)<br>
Since the thermodynamical β-modification starts to be changed into the more stable α-<br>
modification at temperatures above 150 °C, a part of the β-modification is transferred within<br>
the heating process of DSC-measurement. Therefore, the amount of β-PP determined by<br>
DSC is lower as when measured according to the method of Turner-Jones by WAXS (A.<br>
Turner-Jones et. al., Makromol. Chem 75 (1964) 134).<br>
"Second heat" means that the sample is heated according to ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2<br>
for a first time and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of 10 °C/min. The sample is<br>
 <br>
then heated a second time, also according to ISO 3146 / part 3 / method C2. This second heat<br>
is relevant for measurement and calculation.<br>
During the "first heat" all thermal history of the sample giving rise to different crystalline<br>
structure, which typically comes from different processing conditions and/or methods, is<br>
destroyed. Using the second heat for determination of ft-crystallinity, it is possible to<br>
compare samples regardless of the way the samples were originally manufactured.<br>
The xylene solubles (XS, wt.-%):<br>
Analysis according to the known method (ISO 6427): 2.0 g of polymer is dissolved in 250<br>
ml p-xylene at 135°C under agitation. After 30±2 minutes the solution is allowed to cool for<br>
15 minutes at ambient temperature (21 °C) and then allowed to settle for 30 minutes at<br>
25±0.5°C. The solution is filtered and evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue dried<br>
under vacuum at 90 °C until constant weight is reached.<br>
XS% = (100 x m1 x v0) / (m0 x V1), wherein<br>
m„ = initial polymer amount (g)<br>
m1 = weight of residue (g)<br>
v0, = initial volume (ml)<br>
V1 = volume of analyzed sample (ml)<br>

Flexural modulus: was measured according to ISO 178 (room temperature, if not otherwise<br>
mentioned) by using injection moulded test specimens as described in EN ISO 1873-2<br>
(80x10x4 mm).<br>

(thickness 10 mm). The lest specimens are stressed in an aqueous solution at 80 °C and 4<br>
 <br>
N/mm2. For each sample 3 specimens are tested and reported individually, indicated by<br>
FNCT/1. FNCT/2 and FNCT/3.<br>

ICP analysis<br>
The elemental analysis of a catalyst was performed by taking a solid sample of mass, M,<br>
cooling over dry ice. Samples were diluted up to a known volume, V, by dissolving in nitric<br>
acid (HN03, 65 %, 5 % of V) and freshly deionised (DI) water (5 % of V). The solution was<br>
then added to hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40 %, 3 % of V), diluted with DI water up to the final<br>
volume, V, and left to stabilise for two hours.<br>
The analysis was run at room temperature using a Thermo Elemental IRIS Advantage XUV<br>
Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Excitation Spectrometer (ICP-AES) which was<br>
calibrated immediately before analysis using a blank (a solution of 5 % HNO3, 3 % HF in DI<br>
water), a low standard (10 ppm Al in a solution of 5 % HNO3, 3 % HF in DI water), a high<br>
standard (50 ppm Al, 50 ppm Hf, 20 ppm Zr in a solution of 5 % HNO3, 3 % HF in DI<br>
 <br>
water) and a quality control sample (20 ppm Al, 20 ppm Hf, 10 ppm Zr in a solution of 5 %<br>
HN03, 3 % HF in DI water).<br>
The content of hafnium was monitored using the 282.022 nm and 339.980 nm lines and the<br>
content for zirconium using 339.198 nm line. The content of aluminium was monitored via<br>
the 167.081 nm line, when Al concentration in ICP sample was between 0-10 ppm and via<br>
the 396.152 nm line for Al concentrations between 10-100 ppm.<br>
The reported values, required to be between 0 and 100, or further dilution is required, are an<br>
average of three successive aliquots taken from the same sample and are related back to the<br>
original catalyst using equation 1.<br>
 <br>
wherein<br>
C is the concentration in ppm, related to % content by a factor of 10,000<br>
R is the reported value from the ICP-AES<br>
V is the total volume of dilution in ml<br>
M is the original mass of sample in g<br>
If dilution was required then this also needs to be taken into account by multiplication of C<br>
by the dilution factor.<br>
Inventive Example 1 (E 1)<br>
Preparation of the solid catalyst system<br>
In a 50-mL glass reactor, equipped with an overhead stirrer, a liquid-liquid 2-phase system<br>
was generated at 0 °C from 40 mL of hexadecafluoro-l,3-dimethylcyclohexane (PFC) and a<br>

hydrogen is spilled with 500 g propylene into the reactor. The mixture is stirred for at least<br>
15 min before the catalyst as obtained above (395 mg) is contacted with 5 ml<br>
hexadecafluoro-l,3-dimethyl-cyclohexane (1.5 bar N2-pressure used for transfer to catalyst<br>
feeder) for 10 sec before this slurry is injected into the reactor at stirring speed of 150 rpm<br>
with 100 g propylene. After increasing the stirring speed to 350 rpm the internal temperature<br>
of the reactor is raised to the desired polymerisation temperature of 70 °C within about 15<br>
minutes. The polymerisation time is counted to start from the moment when the internal<br>
temperature of 68 °C is reached after which the polymerisation is allowed to proceed for 30<br>
minutes. The polymerisation is stopped by flashing the monomer and cooling down the<br>
reactor. The reactor is purged with nitrogen before discharging the polymer. A small part of<br>
the polymer has been dried in a hood over night and additionally in a vacuum oven for 3<br>
