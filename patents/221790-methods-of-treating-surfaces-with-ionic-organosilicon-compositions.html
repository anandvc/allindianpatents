BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods of water proofing inorganic surfaces with an aqueous solution containing an ionic organosilicon compound. Additionally, the present invention is directed to an inorganic surface treated with an aqueous solution containing an ionic organosilicon compound such that a water resistant film covers the inorganic surface.<br>
Water resistance is an important issue in many types of construction including masonry and concrete. Resistance to water is of great importance since moisture absorption and its movement in these types of materials cause or contributes to problems such as expansion, shrinkage, cracking, staining, mildew, lowered resistance to freezing and thawing, chemical attack, corrosion of reinforcing steel, and damage to structures from settling. Due to these problems, various techniques have been used to render these types of surfaces water resistant including surface treatment of structures with water repellents. Water repellents that have been used in the past include oils, waxes, soaps, and resins. These repellants have been applied to surfaces by brush, roller, air spray, or airless spray techniques. One type of water repellent that has been used is organosilicon compounds. These compounds in organic solvents have been found to be useful for providing water resistance to brick, concrete, stucco, or terrazo surfaces.<br>
As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,195, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, application of organosilicon compounds to surfaces for water proofing is well known in the art. The use of organosilicones such as alkyltrialkoxy compounds for imparting water resistance has been known for at least 30 years. Traditionally, application of these compounds was carried out in flammable solvents such as ethanol, methanol and various liquid hydrocarbons. During application, volatile organic compounds (VOC) were heavily emitted. Due to these problems, significant efforts were employed to formulate a nonflammable composition for imparting water resistance to masonry and concrete surfaces. The first approach attempted included various water emulsions containing organosilicon compounds. However, these formulations failed to provide water resistance comparable to the solvent based compositions. In recognition of the shortcomings associated with the water emulsion formulation, formulations were developed to make alkyltrialkoxy silanes water soluble. Formulations of this type utilize water soluble amino and quaternary ammonium organosilanes<br>
-2-<br><br>
along with alkyltrialkoxysilanes of the traditional formulations. The intent of these formulations was to exploit the soluble organosilanes to solubilize the alkyltrialkoxysilanes, which provided the water repellant characteristic.<br>
In addition to water resistance, numerous types of construction materials benefit from treatment with an antimicrobial agent. Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that prevent microbial contamination and deterioration of materials. Possibly the most prevalent group of antimicrobials is quaternary ammonium compounds. The use of low level (1% or lower) quaternary ammonium silanes as antimicrobial agents is well known and taught in a wide variety of United States patents including U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,560,385; 3,794,736; and 3,814,739. Due to their antimicrobial qualities, their application is beneficial for a variety of surfaces, substrates, instruments and applications. Examples of such uses are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701; 3,794,736; 3,860,709; 4,282,366; 4,504,541; 4,615,937; 4,692,374; 4,408,996; and 4,414,268; the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Application of an aqueous solution containing a quaternary ammonium silane is discussed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,921,701 and 5,169,625.<br>
Relevant to the present invention are U.S. Pat. 5,209,775, 5,421,866, 5,695,551, CA 2,115,622 and JP 3,159,975. These patents are directed to water dispersible or water emulsion water repellent compositions of silicon compounds. The compositions disclosed in these patents contain (1) alkylalkoxy silane or siloxanes; (2) a water soluble silane; and (3) either aminosilane or quaternary ammonium silane. The role of soluble silane, aminosilane or ionic quaternary ammonium silane, in these compositions is to stabilize the alkylalkoxysilane, siloxane, or other water insoluble polymers in water.<br>
The use of hydrophobic water insoluble silanes as water repellents in various organic solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons has been traditionally preferred due to their superior performance. However, the principal limitations of these solvent type compositions include their inherent toxicity and flammability. While providing an ecological improvement over solvent based treatments, the existing organosiloxane emulsions and water dispersible silanes or siloxanes do not compare well with existing solvent-base silanes, silane/siloxanes combinations or siloxanes in terms of stability, penetration depth, and the beading effect of the treated substrate. Additionally, the use of surfactants may cause rewetting of the surface.<br><br>
Therefore, there remains a need for an aqueous water proofing treatment capable of providing at least equally efficient water resistance as treatments utilizing solvent based compositions. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of treating surfaces with an aqueous solution; wherein the treated surface exhibits water resistance at least equal to that provided by solvent based treatments. Additionally, it is an object of this invention to provide the following three highly desired requirements for providing long term hydrophobicity on inorganic substrates: (1) application of a safer and environmentally acceptable aqueous solution, (2) imparting molecular level hydrophobicity and (3) reactivity with a substrate to provide long term performance.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to methods of treating inorganic surfaces with aqueous<br>
compositions including ionic organosilicon compounds and various inorganic treated surfaces. Surprisingly, it has been found that the application of water soluble ionic organosilicon compounds, which until the present invention have only been used in small quantities to solubilize silanes, to inorganic surfaces provides the treated surface with an excellent hydrophobic property. The present invention satisfies the aforementioned requirements by applying an aqueous solution comprising an ionic organosilicon compound, which has an ionic group, a hydrophobic group and at least one alkoxy group on silicon.<br>
The present invention exclusively utilizes ionic organosilicon compounds as the main or sole component for imparting water repellency upon surface treatment of inorganic substrates. The methods of the present invention comprise the application of all aqueous solutions consisting essentially of at least one ionic ogranosilicon compound to inorganic surfaces thereby imparting water resistance to the surface. Although desiring not to be held to the following explanation, it is believed that upon drying of the aqueous ionic organosilicon solution; the molecular packing on the surface is such that the ionic group which enables solubility in water is buried deep within the structure after the silane forms chemical bonds with the inorganic surface. Accordingly, after application a treated surface may be characterized as a long term water repellant coating. Thus, there are differences between what is taught in accordance with the concept of the present invention and what is disclosed in the prior art as evidenced by the several patents noted and discussed above.<br>

The compositions in accordance with the present invention are made by dissolving an ionic organosilicon in water. Additionally, more than one ionic organosilicon compound can be<br>

dissolved in water to formulate an aqueous composition comprising more than one ionic organosilicon compound. Furthermore, some compositions in accordance with the present invention may also include known excipients such as for example wetting agents, surfactants, and antimicrobial agents. These compositions comply with the local state and federal regulations regarding volatile organic content (VOC) with desired application dosage and can be applied to a wide variety of surfaces by any known means including for example by brush, roller, air spray, and airless spray techniques. After an aqueous composition comprising an ionic organosilicon is applied and allowed to dry, a treated surface is obtained comprising a protective water resistant layer bonded to the substrate. Although desiring not to be held to the following explanation, it is believed that upon drying the molecular packing on the surface is such that the ionic group which enables solubility in water is buried deep within the structure after the silane forms chemical bonds with the surface. Furthermore, it is believed that the long chain on the central ionic group prohibits water from reaching the soluble ionic part of the molecule. Accordingly, the present invention also provides treated surfaces comprising a unique layer in which the soluble components are shielded from water by long chains attached to the soluble component.<br>
Any surface with functional groups or reactive sites that will bond with the silanols created by hydrolysis of the silane alkoxy groups may be rendered water repellant upon treatment with aqueous solutions of the present invention. Accordingly a treated surface in accordance with the present invention may be characterized as a polycondensate of an ionic organosilicon compound. Some suitable surfaces for example include heavy and light weight concrete, masonry products, gypsum, concrete blocks, cinder blocks, soft mud bricks, sand lime bricks, drain tiles, ceramic tiles, sandstone, plaster, clay bricks, natural stones and rocks, roofing tiles, calcium silicate bricks, cement articles, slag stones and bricks, stucco, limestone, macadam, marble, grouts, mortar, terrazzo, clinker, pumice, terra, cotta, porcelain, adobe, coral, dolomite and asphalt. Non-cement surfaces may be treated with compositions of the present invention including but not limited to perlite, cellular glass, vermiculite, mica, silica and diatomaceous earth.<br>
In one embodiment, the aqueous ionic organosilicon composition may include at least about 0.1 weight percent of an ionic organosilicon compound. Additionally, some embodiments may include between about 0.1 and about 10 weight percent of an ionic<br>
-8-<br><br>
orgaosilicaon compound while others may comprise between about 10 and 99 weight percent or between about 20 and 60 weight percent of an organosilicon compound.<br>

Standard M20 block samples were used for testing. The standard size bricks were cut into three equal parts for testing. The sandstone pieces were 7-cm X 6-mm X 7-cm. An untreated control was included for comparison and to calculate water exclusion. The samples were cleaned with a wire brush and cloth. The pieces were weighed and dried in an oven at 100° C until a constant weight was reached. The water uptake was determined by the procedures established according to ASTM D-6489. The pieces were weighed and placed in 1-cm of water for 24 hours, weighed again and dried in a 100° C oven until a constant weight was reached. The pieces were then treated with a water repellent as described in example 6. After soaking in 1-cm of water for 24 hours and the pieces were weighed again. Water uptake, percent water absorption (water uptake X 100/ Weight of dry piece) and % water exclusion were calculated by:<br>

(water uptake of control - water uptake of treated sample) X 100 water uptake of control<br>
A 2.5 weight percent solution of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride was prepared by dissolving in tap water. Three samples of each substrate were treated by dipping the sample for 20 seconds. The samples were allowed to cure for 24 hours. They were further dried in an oven at 100° C for one hour. After removal from the oven, the samples were allowed to attain room temperature before measurements were taken. Water uptake was determined using ASTM method D6489. The calculated results of the average of three samples are summarized in Table-II<br>

Example 8 Rilem hydraulic water penetration test (Test II.4)<br>
A 2.5 % solution of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldirnethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride was prepared by dissolving in tap water. Three samples of each substrate were treated by dipping the sample in the aqueous solution for 20 seconds. The samples were allowed to cure for 24 hours. Then they were further dried in an oven at 100° C for one hour. The samples were allowed to attain room temperature before measurements were taken. An uptake tube was affixed to substrate's surface by interposing a strip of caulk between the circular brim of the tube and the surface of the masonry material with applied pressure. Water was then added to the opening in the tube until it reached the zero graduation mark. The quantity of water absorbed by the substrate in 20 minutes is read from the graduation marks on the tube. The data is provided in Table-Ill which shows milliliters (mis) lost in 20 minutes.<br>

A 2.5 % solution of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride was prepared by dissolving in tap water. Three samples of each substrate were treated by dipping the sample in the aqueous solution for 20 seconds. The samples were allowed to cure for 24 hours. Then they were further dried in an oven at 100° C for one hour. The samples were allowed to attain room temperature before measurements were taken. Each sample was split longitudinally using a hammer and chisel. One half of each sample was placed fractured surface down in a water soluble dye solution. Only the untreated portion of each sample absorbed the solution and became stained. The depth of penetration was measured from the surface down to the stained region. The average penetration is provided in Table-IV.<br>

Example 10 Capillary Absorption Test<br>
After conditioning, samples of treated and untreated concrete cubes were taken for further experimentation. Initial weights of all the cubes were recorded. The weighed samples were placed in a container on a porous support made from a pack of filter papers. The thickness of the pack was approximately 1cm. The pack of filter papers ensures immediate and continuous contact between water and only the surface on which the samples were resting. Tap water was slowly poured into the container until the paper was completely saturated. The water level was not allowed to rise beyond the top border of the pack. For reducing evaporation of water, the container was covered with a glass sheet.<br>
For assessing the capillary water absorption, the samples were removed from the container after one hour. After wiping the surface in contact with water with a damp cloth, each sample was weighed. The results obtained are provided in Table-V.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
This invention is directed to methods of treating inorganic surfaces with aqueous compositions including ionic organosilicon compounds. Surprisingly, it has been found that the application of water soluble ionic organosilicon compounds, which until the present invention have only been used in small quantities to solubilize silanes, to inorganic surfaces provides the treated surface with an excellent hydrophobic property. The present invention exclusively utilizes ionic organosilicon compounds as the main or sole component for imparting water repellency upon surface treatment of inorganic substrates. The methods of the present invention comprise the application of ionic ogranosilicon compounds to inorganic surfaces whereby imparting water resistance to the substrate. After application, a treated surface may be characterized as having a long term water repellant property.<br><br>
