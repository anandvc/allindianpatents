TOPICAL PATCH PREPARATION CONTAINING A DELAYED-TYPE<br>
HYPERSENSITIVITY INDUCER AND METHODS FOR USING THE SAME<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The field of this invention is delayed-type hypersensitivity inducing agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The number of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) patients worldwide has been<br>
increasing rapidly in recent years, and is said to be approximately 33 million (WHO; end of<br>
1998). Against this backdrop, there is a rush to develop a vaccine for HIV. However,<br>
because of the mutation of the configuration of the virus following infection, a feature of<br>
HIV, an accurate vaccine has not yet been found. In addition, although many therapeutic<br>
medications for HIV have been developed, none completely cure HIV. Furthermore, current<br>
AIDS drugs (protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nucleoside<br>
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, etc.) employ complex techniques. Long-term administration<br>
of these agents causes patients to suffer persistent adverse events, such as anemia, peripheral<br>
neuritis, pancreatitis, nausea, and headaches. Also, the possibility of long-term<br>
administration resulting in drug resistance cannot be ruled out. Yet another disadvantage of<br>
current treatment modalities is cost, in that current therapeutic medications for HIV are<br>
extremely expensive, often ranging between $15,000 to $20,000 per person per year, which<br>
necessarily limits patient access.<br>
One type of agent that represents an effective alternative to current HIV treatment<br>
modalities is the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) inducing agent, which type of agent<br>
has been researched as an immunomodulator that elicits immunological response in HIV<br>
patients by increasing the activity of the immune system cells in the body. Delayed-type<br>
hypersensitivity inducers are substances that induce Type 4 hypersensitivity when they come<br><br>
into contact with human skin, and they include trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, picryl<br>
chloride(PC), 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene(DNFB), and l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB).<br>
Of these, DNCB has been widely used in the treatment of HIV and in immunological<br>
research, and the present invention focuses on DNCB as a DTH inducer in many<br>
embodiments, as described in greater detail below.<br>
DNCB was discovered in Germany before World War II. Research conducted in the<br>
1950s in the US demonstrated that DNCB is not carcinogenic. Later, in the 1970s, safety<br>
research was conducted in various types of animals. DNCB is generally known to be a<br>
powerful, delayed allergy-inducing skin irritant in humans, and is used in, among other<br>
things, immunological tests of skin diseases.<br>
Research on DNCB therapy in HIV patients began slowly from the middle of the<br>
1980s, and research on DNCB therapy in HIV patients was conducted in the first half of the<br>
1990s, from which DNCB was claimed to be effective for treating HIV. However, this claim<br>
was not proved. In the latter half of the 1990s, the development of PCR analysis technology<br>
began to confirm the efficacy of DNCB in HIV patients. In addition, DNCB was also<br>
previously investigated as a possible treatment for cancer: tests were conducted in which<br>
DNCB was applied locally to induce a delayed allergic reaction and thereby utilize its<br>
immunity inducing capabilities. However, these findings have not been put to practical use.<br>
Furthermore, DNCB has been used in, among other things, the treatment of warts.<br>
A method for using DNCB in HIV patients that has been employed in recent years<br>
has been to dissolve the DNCB in an acetone solvent and impregnate a gauze-like cloth with<br>
the resulting product and apply this to the skin. This topical preparation is then dried,<br>
covered and left to stand for several hours (typically at least 8 hours). This long application<br>
time means that an HIV patient would be restricted for at least 8 hours, a fairly long time,<br>
which would prevent that person from leading the same lifestyle as a healthy person.<br>
There is considerable interest, therefore, in the development of a topical DTH<br>
inducing agent composition that could efficiently deHver an effective amount of a DTH<br>
inducing agent to a host in a short period of time.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
Topical patch preparations that contain a delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer, e.g.,<br>
l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), and methods for using the same are provided. The<br>
subject topical patch preparations are made up of an adhesive gel composition that is present<br>
on a support, where the adhesive gel composition includes the delayed-type hypersensitivity<br>
inducer, a water-soluble polymer gel, water and a water holding agent. In using the subject<br>
topical patch preparations, the topical patch preparations are applied to a skin surface of a<br>
subject and maintained at the site of application for a period of time sufficient for an<br>
effective amount of the delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer to be administered to the<br>
subject, where this maintenance period typically does not exceed about 60 minutes. The<br>
subject invention finds use in a variety of applications where the administration of a delayed-<br>
type hypersensitivity inducer is desired, and is particularly suited for use in the treatment of<br>
HIV associated disease conditions, e.g., AIDS. In further describing the subject invention,<br>
the topical patch preparations are described first in greater detail, followed by a review of<br>
representative applications in which the subject topical patch preparations find use.<br>
Before the subject invention is described further, it is to be understood that the<br>
invention is not limited to the particular embodiments of the invention described below, as<br>
variations of the particular embodiments may be made and still fall within the scope of the<br>
appended claims. It is also to be understood that the terminology employed is for the<br>
purpose of describing particular embodiments, and is not intended to be limiting. Instead,<br>
the scope of the present invention will be established by the appended claims.<br>
In this specification and the appended claims, singular references include the plural,<br>
unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and<br>
scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.<br><br>
TOPICAL PATCH PREPARATIONS<br>
As summarized above, the subject invention is directed to topical patch preparations<br>
of a delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer agent. The topical patch preparations of the<br>
subject invention are characterized by having an effective amount of the delayed type<br>
hypersensitivity inducer agent present in a gel adhesive base. Figure 1 provides a<br>
representation of a topical patch preparation described according to the subject invention. As<br>
can be seen in Figure 1, this representative topical patch preparation 10 contains a gel<br>
adhesive base 12 present on a support 14. Each of these components is now described in<br>
greater detail.<br>
The gel adhesive base which serves as the delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer<br>
retaining layer, is made up of the delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer that is present in,<br>
e.g., dissolved in or dispersed in, and adhesive gel base. By "delayed-type hypersensitivity<br>
(DTH) inducers" is meant an immunomodulator that elicits immunological response in a<br>
subject, such as HIV patients, by increasing the activity of the immune system cells in the<br>
body. Delayed-type hypersensitivity inducers are substances that induce Type 4<br>
hypersensitivity when they come into contact with human skin, and they include, but are not<br>
limited to: trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid, picryl chloride (PC), 2,4-<br>
dinitrofluorobenzene(DNFB), and l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB). In many<br>
embodiments, the delayed-type hypersensitivity inducer is DNCB.<br>
The amount of DTH inducer that is present in the adhesive gel base is an amount<br>
sufficient to administer to a subject an effective amount of the agent when applied to a skin<br>
surface of the subject, as described in greater detail below. In many embodiments, the<br>
amount of DTH inducer present in the adhesive gel base ranges from about 0.01 to 10.0 %<br>
(w/w), sometimes from about 0.05 to 10.0 % (w/w), usually from about 0.1 to 5.0 % (w/w)<br>
and more usually from about 0.2 to 3.0 % (w/w).<br>
The adhesive gel base that includes the DTH inducer, as described above, is made up<br>
of a water-soluble high molecular weight substance, water and a water retaining agent. In<br>
certain embodiments, the adhesive gel base may further include a cosolvent, e.g., an organic<br>
cosolvent. Each of these components is now described separately in greater detail.<br>
Water-soluble high molecular weight substances of interest include water-soluble<br>
polymers, where polymers of interest include, but are not limited to: gelatin, starch, agar,<br>
mannan, alginic acid, polyacrylic acid, polyacrylate, dextrin, methylcellulose, sodium<br><br>
methylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose gum,<br>
carboxyvinyl polymer, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Arabia gum, acacia,<br>
tragacanth gum, karaya gum, and starch acrylate copolymer or other starch sodium acrylate<br>
graft copolymers. Metallic salts of these, as well as the products of cross-linking these by<br>
means of organic or inorganic cross-linking agents, are also of interest. These water-soluble<br>
polymers can be used to bring out the properties and characteristics of the other starting<br>
materials used in the adhesive gel composition, and in practice can be used alone or in<br>
combinations of 2 or more. The amount of water soluble high molecular weight substance(s)<br>
present in the adhesive gel base generally ranges from about 0.5 to 20, usually from a bout 2<br>
to 20 % (w/w).<br>
While any convenient water may be employed as the water component, of interest are<br>
distilled water or ion-exchange water or the like, which is preferred in many embodiments of<br>
the subject invention. The amount of water present in the gel adhesive is sufficient to impart<br>
the desired physical properties to the gel adhesive, and to improve the swelling of the homy<br>
or keratinized layer of the skin to thereby improve the permeability or penetration of the<br>
DTH inducing agent(s), where the amount of water in the gel composition generally ranges<br>
from about 10 to 80%, usually from about 30 to 60% (w/w).<br>
The water-retaining agent or water-holding agent of the subject adhesive gel<br>
compositions is any agent that is capable of at least diminishing the volatilization of water<br>
contained in the adhesive gel base so that the water content in the adhesive gel base is<br>
maintained at least a substantially constant, if not constant, level during storage and use of<br>
the preparation. One or more water-retaining agents may be employed in the subject<br>
compositions, where the amount of water-retaining agent present in the adhesive gel base<br>
generally ranges from about 1 to 70%, more preferably 10 to 60% by weight. Examples of<br>
suitable water-retaining or water-holding agents include, but are not limited to: 1 or more<br>
types of polyvalent or polyhydric or sugars or alcohols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, propylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, and ethylene glycol, and the like.<br>
In addition, the subject gel base compositions may also include a cosolvent, where<br>
the cosolvent is generally an organic cosolvent. Examples of DNCB cosolvents of interest<br>
include, but are not limited to, n-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, crotamiton, ethyl alcohol, methyl<br>
alcohol, polyethylene glycol (e.g., low molecular weight polyethylene glycol, such as PEG<br>
600 or lower, e.g., 500, 400, 300,200,100 etc) and blends thereof, and acetone, where n-<br>
methyl-2-pyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and crotamiton are of particular interest. The<br><br>
cosolvent may be made up of a simple component or be incombination of two or more<br>
components.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to the aforementioned ingredients, various additives that are<br>
used in ordinary topical water-soluble patch preparations may also be suitably compounded<br>
as needed, including inorganic substances such as kaolin, bentonite, and titanium dioxide;<br>
preservatives such as paraben; anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants; metallic aluminum<br>
crosslinking agents such as aluminum chloride, dried aluminum hydroxide gel, and<br>
dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate; oils such as jojoba oil and castor oil; chelating agents<br>
such as EDTA; pH regulators such as malic acid, tartaric acid, and diisopropanolamine;<br>
alcohols such as ethanol; moisture retaining agents such as hyaluronic acid, aloe extract, and<br>
urea; and other perfumes and coloring agents.<br>
The pH of the gel base composition typically is one that lies in a physiologically<br>
acceptable range, where the pH typically ranges from about 4.0 to 7.0 and more typically<br>
ranges from about 4.0 to 6.0.<br>
As mentioned above, the adhesive gel composition containing the one or more active<br>
ingredients is typically present on a support or backing. The support is generally made of a<br>
flexible material which is capable of fitting in the movement of human body and includes,<br>
for example, various non-woven fabrics, woven fabrics, spandex, flannel, or a laminate of<br>
these materials with polyethylene film, polyethylene glycol terephthalate film, polyvinyl<br>
chloride film, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer film, polyurethane film, and the like.<br>
In addition to the adhesive gel composition and the support layer, the subject topical<br>
patches may also include a release film 16 on the surface of the gel layer opposite the<br>
backing that provides for protection of the gel layer from the environment. The release film<br>
may be any convenient material, where representative release films include polyesters, such<br>
as PET or PP, and the like.<br>
In many embodiments, the patch is present in a sealed package. Generally,, the sealed<br>
package is fabricated from a packaging material that includes a layer made out of a material<br>
capable of preventing passage of moisture, oxygen and other agents, i.e., the package<br>
includes in a moisture/oxygen barrier material. Any suitable barrier material may be<br>
employed, where barrier materials of interest include metallic layers, e.g., aluminum, where<br>
in many embodiments, the barrier layer is an aluminum layer. This barrier layer has a<br>
thickness sufficient to provide for the barrier function, where the thickness typically ranges<br>
from about 5 to 15, usually from about 6 to 10 |^m. In many embodiments, the package is a<br><br>
laminate of the barrier layer in combination with one or more additional layers, e.g.,<br>
polymeric layers, paper layers, etc. A representative aluminum containing package that may<br>
be used with the subject patch preparations is sold by Dainippon Printing Co., Ltd. (Kyoto,<br>
Japan).<br>
The topical patch preparations may be fabricated using any convenient protocol. One<br>
convenient protocol for fabrication of the subject patches includes preparing a gel adhesive<br>
paste through the uniform mixing of the aforementioned ingredients and then coating the<br>
paste onto the support, followed by cutting of the resultant product to the specified size to<br>
obtain the desired topical patch preparation. The resultant topical patch preparation is then<br>
heat-sealed, typically several sheets to a package, using a packaging material containing an<br>
aluminum layer, as described supra, to obtain the sealed topical patch. For a more detailed<br>
description of the fabrication protocol, see U.S. Patent No. 5,827,529; the disclosure of<br>
which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In a representative fabrication protocol, the base used in the present invention is<br>
produced by using a mixer to uniformly blend the aforementioned ingredients by means of<br>
any convenient protocol into a paste, which is then spread by means of a spreader onto a<br>
backing or support material. As indicated above, the support material may be, for example,<br>
paper, or a woven or nonwoven cloth made of PET or PP or some other polyester fiber. For<br>
protection, the surface thereof is then covered with a release film of a polyester such as PET<br>
or PP. These steps are illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
The resulting product is then cut to the specified size to obtain the desired topical<br>
patch preparation composition. The shape of the patch may vary, where representative<br>
shapes include square, rectangle, oval, circle, etc. The size of the patch may also vary, where<br>
in many embodiments the size ranges from about 1 to 200 cm^, and in many embodiments<br>
from about 10 to 100 cm^, usually from about 20 to 50 cm^, e.g., 25 cm^. The weight of the<br>
base in the final topical patch should be 300 to 1500 g/m^, and preferably 600 to 1000 g/m^.<br>
This water-soluble topical patch preparation is then packaged by means of a heat seal in a<br>
packaging material that includes a layer of aluminum to obtain the final product, as shown in<br>
Figure 3.<br>
It should be noted that the above manufacturing protocols are merely representative.<br>
Any convenient protocol that is capable of producing the subject topical patch preparations,<br>
as described above, may be employed.<br><br>
'METHODS OF USING PATCH PREPARATIONS<br>
The subject patch preparations find use in the topical delivery of DTH inducing<br>
agents, e.g., DNCB, to a host. By "topical delivery" is meant delivery via absorption through<br>
the skin. In using the subject topical patch preparations to topically administer a DTH<br>
inducing agent to the host, the topical preparation is applied to a skin surface and maintained<br>
at the site of application for a period of time sufficient for the desired amount of DTH<br>
inducing agent to be delivered to the host. In many embodiments, the period of time required<br>
to deliver the desired amount of agent is short, generally not exceeding about 60 minutes,<br>
usually not exceeding about 30 minutes and in many embodiments not exceeding about 15<br>
minutes. However, the period of time during which the preparation is maintained at the<br>
application site is, in many embodiments, at least about 1 minute, usually at least about 3<br>
minutes and more usually at least about 5 minutes.<br>
The patch may be administered to any convenient topical site. Topical sites of-<br>
interest include, but are not limited to: arms, leg, torso, etc. The surface area that is covered<br>
by the topical patch preparation following application must be sufficient to provide for the<br>
desired amount of agent administration, and in many embodiments ranges from about 1 to<br>
200 cm^, and in many embodiments from about 10 to 100 cm', usually from about 20 to 50<br>
cm^, e.g., 25 cm^. In practicing the subject methods, a topical patch may be applied a single<br>
time or a plurality of times over a given time period, e.g., the course of the disease condition<br>
being treated, where the dosing schedule when a plurality of patches are administered over a<br>
given time period may be daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.<br>
UTILITY<br>
The above described patches and methods find use in any application in which the<br>
administration of an DTH inducing agent to a host is desired. Generally such hosts are<br>
"mammals" or "mammalian," where these terms are used broadly to describe organisms<br>
which are within the class mammalia, including the orders carnivore {e.g., dogs and cats),<br>
rodentia (e.g., mice, guinea pigs, and rats), and primates (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and<br>
monkeys). In many embodiments, the hosts will be humans.<br>
In many embodiments, the subject methods find use in the treatment of a disease<br>
condition. By treatment is meant at least an amelioration of the symptoms associated with<br>
the pathological condition afflicting the host, where amelioration is used in a broad sense to<br><br>
refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, e.g. symptom, associated with<br>
the pathological condition being treated, such as viral load or side effects associated<br>
therewith. As such, treatment also includes situations where the pathological condition, or at<br>
least symptoms associated therewith, are completely inhibited, e.g. prevented from<br>
happening, or stopped, e.g. terminated, such that the host no longer suffers from the<br>
pathological condition, or at least the symptoms that characterize the pathological condition.<br>
As such, treatment includes both curing and managing a disease condition.<br>
In many embodiments, the disease condition that is treated according to the subject<br>
methods is one that is a chronic disease. Chronic diseases of interest include, but are not<br>
limited to: chronic fatigue syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, leprosy, leishmaniasis,<br>
diseases associated with the presence of intracellular pathogenic agents (e.g., viruses,<br>
bacteria), such as cytomegalovirus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Penumocystis carinii, and the<br>
like.<br>
Of particular interest is the use of the subject methods in the treatment, e.g.,<br>
management, of immunocompromising disease conditions, and particularly HIV associated<br>
disease conditions, e.g., AIDS. Treatment in the context of HIV associated diseases means<br>
improvement of quality of life, e.g., via reduction in one or more symptoms, the occurrence<br>
of opportunistic infections, etc. In terms of quantifiable parameters associated with HIV<br>
disease conditions, the subject invention finds use in reducing viral load and/or increasing<br>
the population of natural killer cells, while varying the population of at least one of CD4<br>
cells and CDS cells. Such changes in quantifiable parameters are achievable with application<br>
times that do not exceed 15 minutes in length.<br>
KITS<br>
Also provided are kits, where the subject kits at least include one or more DTH<br>
inducing agent topical patch preparations, as described above. The subject topical patch<br>
preparations in the kits may be present in a package, as described supra. The topical patches<br>
of the kits are typically present in individual pouches or analogous containers, to preserve<br>
the composition of the patches until use. The subject kits also generally include instructions<br>
for how to use the patches in DTH inducing agent delivery to a host where the instructions<br>
typically include information about where to apply the patch, dosing schedules etc. In certain<br>
embodiments, the subject kits include instructions on how to use to the patched to treat a<br>
particular disease condition with a DTH inducing agent. The instructions are generally<br><br>
recorded on a suitable recording medium. For example, the instructions may be printed on a<br>
substrate, such as paper or plastic, etc. As such, the instructions may be present in the kits as<br>
a package insert, in the labeling of the container of the kit or components thereof (i.e.<br>
associated with the packaging or subpackaging) etc. In other embodiments, the instructions<br>
are present as an electronic storage data file present on a suitable computer readable storage<br>
medium, e.g. CD-ROM, diskette, etc.<br>
The following practical and comparative examples are offered by way of illustration<br>
and not by way of limitation.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Practical and comparative examples are given below, but the manufacturing method<br>
is not limited thereby.<br>
I.	Preparation of Topical Patches<br>
Practical Examples-A water-soluble polymer topical patch preparation in which<br>
DNCB has been compounded in an amount of 2%. 2% DNCB is dissolved in n-methyl-2-<br>
pvrrolidone, after which the ingredients are blended into uniformity and adjusted into a<br>
paste, which is then spread onto a PET nonwoven cloth to a weight of 850 g/m^; the<br>
resulting product is then laminated with a PP film and then cut into 5 cm squares. Finally,<br>
each individual DNCB patch is heat-sealed in packaging material containing aluminum foil<br>
to obtain the finished product. See Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
Placebo -A water-soluble polymer topical patch preparation in which water was used<br>
in place of the DNCB in the practical example. The ingredients are blended into uniformity<br>
and adjusted into a paste, which is then spread onto a PET nonwoven cloth to a weight of<br>
850 g/m'; the resulting product is then laminated with a PP film and then cut into 5 cm<br>
squares. Finally, each individual placebo patch is heat-sealed in packaging material<br>
containing aluminum foil to obtain the finished product. See Figs. 2 and 3. Table 1<br>

IV.      Activity Assay<br>
We applied the DNCB water-soluble topical patch preparation of the practical<br>
example to HIV patient volunteers to investigate its efficacy for HIV. We used the placebo<br>
water-soluble topical patch preparation for comparison.<br>
We applied the patch preparation to the upper extremity of 5 volunteers for 8 hours<br>
(1 patient), 4 hours (1 patient), and 15 minutes (3 patients), and after 1 week collected and<br>
analyzed their blood. Viral Load (VL) measurements were taken by means of ultrasensitive<br>
HIV-1 RNA PCR analysis.<br>
The results are shown below in Table 4.<br>

V.        Discussion<br>
Based on Tables 2 and 3, the DNCB in the water-soluble patch preparation is stable;<br>
discoloration was within a usable range, and practicality was sufficient. Table 4 shows that,<br>
in Patient 1, when the DNCB water-soluble patch preparation was applied for a long period<br>
of time (8 hours), considerable skin irritation occurred; CD4 and CDS counts increased, but<br>
NK decreased, and VL increased. In Patient 2, the degree of skin irritation was less than for<br>
Patient 1. The NK count increased somewhat, and no significant change was seen in VL. For<br>
Patients 3 through 5, the time of application was short (15 minutes), and there was no skin<br>
irritation. However, the CD4 and CDS counts exhibited changes, the NK count clearly<br>
increased, and the VL decreased dramatically, clearly demonstrating the suppression of the<br>
HIV blood concentration. Since DNCB immunological activation contributes to the increase<br>
in NK cells, it is also contributes to the decreased VL. Based on this information, it is<br>
meaningless to apply the DNCB water-soluble patch preparation for a long period of time;<br>
simply applying it to the skin for a short period (about 15 minutes) is extremely effective<br>
versus HIV, and is clearly practical. In addition, we simultaneously conducted a study in<br>
which a placebo was applied; there was no skin irritation, and absolutely no effect on HIV.<br>
This reconfirmed the clear effect of DNCB. Furthermore, when using the patch, simply<br>
applying it to the skin for a short period of time allows AIDS to be treated without a change<br>
in the lifestyle of the patient, who is therefore able to lead exactly the same lifestyle as a<br>
healthy person. In addition, concomitant use with other HIV therapeutic medications is also<br>
quite possible. Research has been conducted for some time into the adverse events of DNCB,<br>
and there have not been any reports to date of cases of life-threatening adverse events, such<br>
as carcinogenicity. Moreover, the DNCB water-soluble topical patch preparation of the<br>
present invention is only applied once a week, so treatment is possible at a cost of<br>
approximately $300 per person per year, making it cheaper than other HIV therapeutic<br>
medications and making it possible to use it in developing countries as well.<br><br>
It is evident from the above results and discussion that the subject invention provides<br>
for a number of advantages in the delivery of DTH inducing agents. The subject topical<br>
preparations are efficient and effective delivery vehicles for administration of a DTH<br>
inducing agent to a subject, and need only be applied for a short period of time in order to<br>
provide the agent administration. Furthermore, the subject topical patch preparations are<br>
25°C storage stable. The subject preparations represent a low cost way of treating many<br>
disease conditions, including AIDS. As such, the subject invention represents a significant<br>
contribution to the art.<br>
