For use of the active compounds of the present invention as a veterinary agent, the dosage will of course vary depending upon the size and age of the animal and the effect desired; for example for prophylactic treatment relatively low doses would be administered over a longer time period, e.g. 1 to 3 weeks. Preferred doses in drinking water are from 0.0125 to 0.05 g/ml, particularly 0.0125 to 0.025 g/ml; and in foodstuffs from 20 to 400 g/metric ton, preferably 20 to 200 g/metric ton. It is preferred to administer the active compounds of the<br><br>
present invention as a veterinary agent to hens in drinking water, to pigs in foodstuff and to calves orally or parenterally, e.g. in the form of oral or parenteral preparations.<br><br><br>
