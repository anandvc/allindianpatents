				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an electrotransport device having a reservoir<br>
housing having a flexible electrically conductive element integrally molded within<br>
the generally non-conductive housing. This flexible/bendable electrically<br>
conductive element allows an electrical connection to be made across the<br>
reservoir housing without physically passing cables or wires through an opening<br>
in the housing.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The term 'electrotransport refers generally to the delivery or extraction of a<br>
therapeutic agent (charged, uncharged, or mixtures thereof) through a body<br>
surface (such as skin, mucous membrane, or nails) wherein the delivery or<br>
extraction is at least partially induced or aided by the application of an electric<br>
potential. The electrotransport process has been found to be useful in the<br>
transdermal administration of many drugs including lidocaine, hydrocortisone,<br>
fluoride, penicillin, and dexamethasone. A common use of electrotransport is in<br>
diagnosing cystic fibrosis by delivering pilocarpine iontophoretically. The<br>
pilocarpine stimulates production of sweat. The sweat is then collected and<br>
analyzed for its chloride content to detect the presence of the disease.<br>
Electrotransport devices generally employ two electrodes, positioned in intimate<br>
contact with some portion of the body, typically the skin. A first electrode, called<br>
the active or donor electrode, is used to deliver the therapeutic agent into the<br>
body. The second electrode, called the counter or return electrode, closes an<br>
electrical circuit with the first electrode through the body. A source of electrical<br><br>
energy such as a battery, supplies electric current to the body through the<br>
electrodes. For example, if the therapeutic agent to be delivered into the body is<br>
a positively charged cation, the anode is the active	<br><br>
electrode and the cathode is the counter electrode required to complete the circuit If the<br>
therapeutic agent to be delivered is a negatively charged anion, the cathode is the donor<br>
electrode and the anode is the counter electrode.<br>
A widely used electrotransport process, electromigration (also called<br>
iontophoresis), involves the electrically induced transport of charged ions (e.g., drug ions)<br>
through a body surface. Another type of electrotransport, called electroosmosis, involves<br>
the trans-body surface (e.g., transdermal) flow of a liquid under the influence of the<br>
applied electric field. Still another type of electrotransport process, called electroporation,<br>
involves forming transiently existing pores in a biological membrane by applying high<br>
voltage pulses. In any given electrotransport system, one or more of these processes may<br>
occur to some extent simultaneously.<br>
Most transdermal electrotransport devices have an anodic and cathodic<br>
electrode assembly. Each electrode assembly is comprised of an electrically conductive<br>
electrode in ion-transmitting relation with an ionically conductive reservoir which is<br>
placed in contact with the patient's skin during use. A hydrogel reservoir such as<br>
described in Webster, US Patent No. 4,383,529 is the preferred form of reservoir since<br>
hydrated gels are easier to handle and manufacture than liquid-filled reservoirs. Water is<br>
by far the preferred liquid solvent for use in such reservoirs. This is in part because many<br>
drug salts are water-soluble and in part because water has excellent biocompatability,<br>
making prolonged contact between the reservoir and the skin acceptable from an irritation<br>
standpoint<br>
The term "agent" is intended to have its broadest interpretation and is used<br>
to include any therapeutic agent or drug, as well as any body analyte, such as glucose.<br>
The terms "drug" and "therapeutic agent" are used interchangeably to refer to any<br>
therapeutically active substance that is delivered to a living organism to produce a<br>
desired, usually beneficial, effect. This includes therapeutic agents in all the major<br>
therapeutic areas including, but not limited to: anti-infectives such as antibiotics and<br>
antiviral agents; analgesics, including fentanyl, sufentanil, remifentanil, buprenorphine<br>
and analgesic combinations; anesthetics; anorexics; antiarthritics; antiasthmatic agents<br><br>
such as terbutaline; anticonvulsants; antidepressants; antidiabetic agents;<br>
antidiarrheals; antihistamines; anti-inflammatoiy agents; antimigraine preparations;<br>
antimotion sickness preparations such as scopolamine and ondansetron; antinauseants;<br>
antineoplastics; antiparkinsonism drugs; antipruritics; antipsychotics; antipyretics;<br>
antispasmodics, including gastrointestinal and urinary; anticholinergics;<br>
sympamornimetrics; xanthine derivatives; cardiovascular preparations, including<br>
calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine; beta blockers; beta-agonists such as<br>
dobutamine and ritodrine; antiarrythrnics; antihypertensives such as atenolol; ACE<br>
inhibitors such as ranitidine; diuretics; vasodilators, including general, coronary,<br>
peripheral, and cerebral; central nervous system stimulants; cough and cold<br>
preparations; decongestants; diagnostics; hormones such as parathyroid hormone;<br>
hypnotics; immunosuppressants; muscle relaxants; parasympatholytics;<br>
parasympathomimetrics; prostaglandins; proteins; peptides; psychostimulants;<br>
sedatives; and tranquilizers.<br>
The term "flexible" is intended to have its standard meaning which means<br>
that a material has the property of being able to be bent without breaking.<br>
Of particular interest in transdermal delivery is the delivery of analeesic<br>
drugs for the management of moderate to severe pain. Control of the rate and duration<br>
of drug delivery is particularly important for transdermal delivery of analgesic drugs to<br>
avoid the potential risk of overdose and the discomfort of an insufficient dosage. One<br>
class of analgesics that has found application in a transdermal delivery route is the<br>
synthetic opiates, a group of 4-aniline piperidines. The synthetic opiates, e.g., fentanyl<br>
and certain of its derivatives such as sufentanil, are particularly well suited for<br>
transdermal administration. These synthetic opiates are characterized by their rapid<br>
onset of analgesia, high potency, and short duration of action. They are estimated to be<br>
80 and 800 times, respectively, more potent than morphine. These drugs are weak<br>
bases, i.e., amines, whose major fraction is cationic in acidic media.<br>
Electrotransport devices use at least two electrodes that are in electrical<br>
contact with some portion of the skin, nails, mucous membrane, or other surface of the<br><br>
body. One electrode, commonly called the "donor" electrode, is the electrode from<br>
which the therapeutic agent is delivered into the body. The other electrode, typically<br>
termed the "counter" electrode, serves to close the electrical circuit through the body.<br>
For example, if the therapeutic agent to be delivered is a positively charged cation, then<br>
the anode is the donor electrode, while the cathode is the counter electrode, which<br>
serves to complete the circuit Alternatively, if a therapeutic agent is a negatively<br>
charged anion, the cathode is the donor electrode and the anode is the counter<br>
electrode. Additionally, bom the anode and cathode may be considered donor<br>
electrodes if both anionic and canonic therapeutic agent ions, or if uncharged dissolved<br>
therapeutic agent, are to be delivered.<br>
Furthermore, electrotransport delivery systems generally require at least<br>
one reservoir or source of the therapeutic agent to be delivered to the body/ Examples<br>
of such donor reservoirs include a pouch or cavity, a porous sponge or pad, and a<br>
hydrophilic polymer or a gel matrix. Such donor reservoirs are electrically connected<br>
to, and positioned between, the anode or cathode and the body surface, to provide a<br>
fixed or renewable source of one or more therapeutic agents or drugs. Electrotransport<br>
devices are powered by an electrical power source such as one or more batteries.<br>
Typically, at any one time, one pole of the power source is electrically connected to the<br>
donor electrode, while the opposite pole is electrically connected to the counter<br>
electrode. Since it has been shown that the rate of electrotransport drug delivery is<br>
approximately proportional to the electric current applied by the device, many<br>
electrotransport devices typically have an electrical controller that controls the voltage<br>
and/or current applied through the electrodes, thereby regulating the rate of drug<br>
delivery. These control circuits use a variety of electrical components to control the<br>
amplitude, polarity, timing, waveform shape, etc. of the electric current and/or voltage<br>
supplied by the power source. See, for example, McNichols et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,047,007.<br>
To date, commercial transdermal electrotransport drug delivery devices<br>
(e.g., the Phoresor, sold by Iomed, Inc. of Salt Lake City, UT; the Dupel Iontophoresis<br>
System sold by Erapi, Inc. of St. Paul, MN; and the Webster Sweat Inducer, model<br><br>
3600, sold by Wescor, Inc. of Logan, UT) have generally utilized a desk-top electrical<br>
power supply unit and a pair of skin contacting electrodes. The donor electrode<br>
assembly contains a drug solution while the counter electrode assembly contains a<br>
solution of a biocompatible electrolyte salt. The power supply unit has electrical<br>
controls for adjusting the amount of electrical current applied through the electrodes.<br>
The "satellite" electrodes are connected to the electrical power supply unit by long<br>
(e.g., 1-2 meters) electrically conductive wires or cables. The wire connections are<br>
subject to disconnection and limit the patient's movement and mobility. Wires between<br>
electrodes and controls may also be annoying or uncomfortable to the patient. Other<br>
examples of desk-top electrical power supply units which use "satellite" electrode<br>
assemblies are disclosed in Jacobsen et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,141,359 (see Figures 3<br>
and 4); LaPrade, U.S. Patent No. 5,006,108 (see Figure 9); and Maurer et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,254,081.<br>
More recently, electrotransport delivery devices have become much<br>
smaller, particularly with the development of miniaturized integrated circuits and more<br>
powerful light weight batteries (e.g., lithium batteries). The advent of inexpensive<br>
miniaturized electronic circuitry and compact, high-energy batteries has meant that the<br>
entire device can be made small enough to be unobtrusively wom on the skin of the<br>
patient, under clothing. This allows" the patient to remain fully ambulatory and able to<br>
perform all normal activities, even during periods when the electrotransport device is<br>
actively delivering drug. Such small self-contained electrotransport delivery devices<br>
are disclosed for example in Tapper, U.S. Patent No. 5,224,927; Sibalis et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,224,928; and Haynes et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,246,418.<br>
Reference is now made to FIG. 1 which depicts an exploded view of an<br>
exemplary electrotransport device 10 having an activation switch in the form of a push<br>
button switch 12 and a display in the form of a light emitting diode (LED) 14. Device<br>
10 comprises an upper housing 16, a circuit board assembly 18, a lower housing 20,<br>
anode electrode 22, cathode electrode 24, anode reservoir 26, cathode reservoir 28 and<br>
skin-compatible adhesive 30. Upper housing 16 may have lateral wings 15, which<br>
assist in holding device 10 on a patient's skin. Upper housing 16, when molded with<br><br>
the lateral wings, is generally composed of rubber or other elastomeric material, such<br>
as an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), silicone, polyolefinic elastomers (Engage*), or<br>
similar material. Upper housing 16, if not molded with the lateral wings, could be<br>
made of a more rigid material such as sryrene, polypropylene, polyethylene or other<br>
similar material. Lower housing 20 is typically composed of a plastic or elastomeric<br>
sheet material (such as polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) or polyethylene)<br>
which can be easily molded or thermoformed to form depressions for the reservoirs and<br>
the electrodes. The sheet material can easily be cut to form openings 23 and 23'<br>
therein. Alternately the lateral wings can be an integral part of the lower housing. In<br>
this case, the lower housing may be molded using an elastomeric material or<br>
thermoformed using a flexible material. Printed circuit board assembly 18 comprises<br>
an integrated circuit 19 coupled to discrete electrical components 40 and battery 32.<br>
Circuit board assembly 18 is attached to housing 16 by posts (not shown in-FIG. 1)<br>
passing through openings 13a and 13b, the ends of the posts being heated and/or melted<br>
in order to heat stake the circuit board assembly 18 to upper housing 16. Alternate<br>
forms of assembly include the use of snap fit components, ultrasonic welding, screws,<br>
rivets or friction fit. Lower housing 20 is attached to the upper housing 16 by means of<br>
adhesive 30, flie upper surface 34 of adhesive 30 being adhered to both lower housing<br>
20 and upper housing 16 including the bottom surfaces of wings 15, if present<br>
On the underside of circuit board assembly 18 is battery 32, which<br>
serves as the power source for the device and which may be a button cell battery, such<br>
as a lithium cell. The circuit outputs of the circuit board assembly 18 make electrical<br>
contact with the electrodes 24 and 22 through openings 23, 23' in the depressions 25,<br>
25' formed in lower housing 20 by means of electrically conductive adhesive 42,42'.<br>
Electrodes 22 and 24, in turn, are in direct electrical and/or mechanical contact with the<br>
top sides 44', 44 of drug reservoir 26 and the non-drug containing electrolyte reservoir<br>
28. The bottom sides 46', 46 of reservoirs 26,28 contact the patient's skin through the<br>
openings 29', 29 in adhesive 30. Upon depression of push button switch 12, the<br>
electronic circuitry on circuit board assembly 18 delivers a predetermined direct<br>
current (DC) to the electrodes/reservoirs 22, 26 and 24, 28 for a delivery interval of<br>
predetermined length.<br><br>
Electrotransport delivery devices are prepared, shipped, and stored (or<br>
stored, shipped, and stored), prescribed and then used. As a result, the devices must<br>
have components that have extended shelf lives that, in some instances, must comply<br>
with regulatory requirements. For instance, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration<br>
has shelf life requirements of from six to eighteen months or more for some materials.<br>
One complicating factor in achieving an extended shelf life is the stability of the<br>
system components when exposed to elevated temperatures. In order to achieve<br>
satisfactory dimensional stability of the elastomeric system components, the molding<br>
conditions as well as secondary manufacturing operations must be carefully optimized,<br>
requiring narrow ranges of process parameters, to avoid warpage, deformation and/or<br>
unacceptable dimensional changes. If the device housing should encounter elevated<br>
temperatures (i.e. over 40 °C) during storage or shipping these same undesirable<br>
deformations or dimensional changes may occur.<br>
Further, electrotransport delivery devices typically contain electronic<br>
components (e.g., integrated circuits, resistors, diodes capacitors, inductors, etc.),<br>
conductive circuit traces, and electrical as well as physical connections therebetween<br>
which can corrode or otherwise be degraded by water or water vapor. Devices such as<br>
device 10 shown in FIG. 1 have hydratable or hydrated reservoirs 26, 28. Thus,<br>
humidity or moisture from the hydrated reservoirs can permeate or leak through the<br>
reservoir housing during manufacturing and storage. The moisture can thus cause<br>
corrosion of the electronic and/or mechanical components within the device, thereby<br>
reducing the shelf life of the device. One source of permeation or leaks is around the<br>
electrodes or around the electrical leads or contacts, which must supply electric current<br>
and voltage from the battery into the relatively wet environment inside of the reservoir<br>
housing.<br>
In order to apply voltage from a power source to the donor reservoir, there<br>
must be some method or device used to place the power source in electrical<br>
communication with the donor reservoir.<br><br>
One method is to mold, punch, drill, or in some other manner fabricate an<br>
opening in the housing used to contain the drug reservoir. An electrode is then placed or<br>
adhered on the inside of the bousing, thus making the electrode accessible through the<br>
opening. The drug reservoir is then placed within the reservoir cavity so that it is in<br>
electrical contact with the electrode. Thereafter, electrical contact can be made with the<br>
drug reservoir via that portion of the electrode that is exposed by the opening in the<br>
reservoir housing.<br>
There are several critical points in the implementation of this method. All<br>
of which involve scaling the opening in the reservoir housing. Because the drug<br>
reservoirs are often largely water, there is tendency for this liquid, moisture and/or<br>
humidity to escape from the housing and corrode the electronic and/or mechanical<br>
components if there is not proper sealing between the electrode and the drug reservoir<br>
housing. Because these devices are shipped and stored in sealed pouches, any water or<br>
moisture escaping from the reservoir will be trapped in the interior of the device and<br>
expose the controller circuitry and other electrical components to the water. Water,<br>
particularly water containing electrolyte salts which are typically found in the drug<br>
reservoir, can be very corrosive and quite damaging to the device.<br>
One solution has been to develop dry or non-hydrated electrodes. See for<br>
example United States Patent Nos. 5,158,537; 5,288,289; 5,310,404; and 5,320,598.<br>
Because the electrode only needs to be hydrated during actual use by the patient during<br>
drug delivery, the device can be manufactured and stored with the reservoir in a dry or<br>
non-hydrated state. Then a bydrating liquid, with or without the agent dissolved therein,<br>
is added to the reservoir just prior to use. But there are a number of design considerations<br>
that must be taken into account when this approach is used and it introduces its own set<br>
of challenges. Problems arise regarding dehydrating and rehydrating without damaging<br>
me drug reservoir and assuring the adequate and timely resolubilization of the active<br>
agent upon rehydration.<br>
Other approaches have been to make the device resistant to moisture and<br>
corrosion. One step that has been taken to combat the corrosion problem has included<br><br>
gold plating the electrical and/or mechanical connectors (such as contacts or contact tabs)<br>
and circuit board traces. Such solutions are inherently expensive and add additional steps<br>
to the manufacturing process.<br>
Other tactics used to deal with the moisture and corrosion problem has<br>
been to seal the electronics in a conformal coating, to package the hydrogel separately<br>
and to include desiccant in the pouch containing the device.<br>
Use of conformal coatings requires an additional processing step which<br>
increases costs and production time. Packaging the drug reservoir gels separately also<br>
increases costs and production time and also includes additional steps for the patient who<br>
must then assemble the device prior to use. Desiccants in the device pouch also require<br>
additional components and also tend to dehydrate the gel reservoirs in the pouches which<br>
results in decreased efficiency when used by the patient<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an electrotransport reservoir housing<br>
having a flexible conductive element integrally molded within the insulated housing so<br>
that a first portion of the element is within the housing and the second portion is outside<br>
of the housing. The incorporation of this flexible conductive element as part of the<br>
reservoir housing enables placing the drug reservoir and electrode, which are inside of the<br>
reservoir housing, in electrical communication with a power source outside of the<br>
reservoir, without the need for an opening to be formed in the reservoir housing after it<br>
has been formed. Because the molding process is performed at high heat and pressure,<br>
there is a very tight, liquid and moisture impermeable bond that is created between the<br>
material forming the reservoir housing and the conductive element This results in a<br>
reservoir housing that is essentially a single integral component that does not require the<br>
fabrication of openings or other passages through the housing which would require<br>
subsequent sealing. By having a conductive element molded into and through the<br>
housing during manufacture, it eliminates problems of water and/or moisture from the<br>
drug reservoir contained within the interior of me reservoir housing leaking through or<br>
otherwise coming in contact with the electrical and/or mechanical components outside of<br>
the reservoir housing.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Accompaning Drawings<br>
A better understanding of the present invention as well as other objects<br>
and advantages thereof will become apparent upon consideration of the following<br>
detailed description especially when taken with the accompanying drawings, wherein like<br>
numerals designate like parts throughout, and wherein:<br>
Figure 1 is an exploded view of a prior art electrotransport device;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the flexible conductive element;<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of a specific implementation of the invention; and<br>
Figure .4 is a sectional view of an embodiment similar to Fig. 3, but which<br>
also includes a circuit board.<br>
Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The following discussion will be made with reference to Figs. 2-4. The<br>
present invention calls for the use of a Flexible Conductor 100 which is comprised of<br>
Electrode End 103 and Contact End 107 and a Connecting Portion 102 which runs<br>
between the two ends. A conductive coating is applied to the surfaces of Electrode<br>
End 103 and Contact End 107 and the Connecting Portion 102. Each of the three<br>
regions may be coated with a different material because the coating for each region<br>
serves a different purpose and has different requirements.<br>
Electrode End 103, which will be located within the reservoir housing,<br>
will serve as part of the electrode assembly and will be coated with Electrode Coating<br>
104 which is a conductive material that fulfills the electrochemistry needs of a<br>
conductive surface located within the reservoir housing. Such material would typically<br>
be a Ag/AgCl ink. Alternatively, a separate Ag/AgCl electrode (not shown) may be<br>
positioned within the reservoir housing so as to be in direct contact with Electrode End<br>
103 and the reservoir gel or reservoir matrix. In mis case, a special coating on<br>
Electrode End 103 may not be required and any conductive coating that is suitable for<br>
use in the moisture rich environment of the reservoir housing may used.<br><br>
The Connecting Portion 102 is coated with Connecting Coating 106<br>
which, because of the physical deformations that are applied to this region, will need to<br>
be highly flexible. Such a coating would typically be any one of a number of flexible<br>
polymers containing conductive particles such as carbon black or powdered metal.<br>
Contact End 107 may be coated with Contact Coating 108, which will<br>
make electrical contact with other electrical components of the electrotransport device<br>
located outside of the reservoir housing. These typically include, but are not limited to<br>
the power source and current regulating circuitry. Contact Coating 108 will effectuate<br>
efficient electrically conductive contact with electrical contact pads or other points of<br>
contact, on a circuit board or other means of electrical communication which would<br>
contain one or more components such as the powen source (e.g. batteries), and current<br>
regulating circuitry.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, Reservoir Housing 120 is molded around the<br>
Connecting Portion 102 of Flexible Conductor 100. Electrode End 103 is positioned<br>
within the reservoir cavity with the Electrode Coating 104 facing towards the open end<br>
of the Reservoir Housing 120. Electrode Coating 104 would therefore be in contact<br>
with the agent-containing reservoir (not shown) that would be placed within Reservoir<br>
Housing 120.<br>
A sufficient length of the Connecting Portion 102 is located outside of<br>
the Reservoir Housing 120 so that Flexible Conductor 100 can be bent or folded back<br>
on itself and be positioned along the upper Outer Surface 140 of Reservoir Housing<br>
120. Part of the Connecting Portion 102 is located outside of the Reservoir Housing<br>
120 and is called the Flexible Region 105. Because of the significant physical<br>
deformation required of Flexible Region 105, Connecting Coating 106 must be<br>
sufficiently flexible so that proper electrical conductivity can be maintained while<br>
being flexed and yet stay physically attached to Connecting Portion 102, even during<br>
significant bending and flexing.<br><br>
After Connecting Portion 102 been defoimed and Flexible<br>
Conductor 100 has been bent back on itself, Contact End 107 is now positioned with<br>
Contact Coating 108 facing away from Reservoir Housing 120. Typically, Contact<br>
Coating 108 is placed in electrical communication with an electrical Contact Pad 135<br>
located on Circuit Board 130, as shown in Fig. 4.. However, Contact Coating 108 may<br>
be placed in contact any of a number of standard electrical connections means well<br>
known in the industry.<br>
Though Contact End 107 and Circuit Board 130 are shown positioned<br>
above Reservoir Housing 120 in Figs. 3 and 4, the use of Flexible Conductor 100<br>
allows the placement of the Contact End 107 and Contact Coating 108 in any<br>
reasonable location relative to Reservoir Housing<br>
Though the embodiment shown describes an underlying flexible<br>
substrate with various coatings on top of the substrate, the scope of the invention does<br>
not require the use of separate coating layers and includes embodiments in which one<br>
or more of the various regions of Flexible Conductor 100: Electrode End 103, Contact<br>
End 107 and Connecting Portion 102 are made of a single layer of material which<br>
fulfills the required function for each region of the Flexible Conductor 100.<br>
It is further within the scope of the invention that Flexible<br>
Conductor 100 can be an integral component formed from a single type of conductive,<br>
flexible material.<br>
The above-described exemplary embodiments are intended to be<br>
illustrative in all respects, rather than restrictive, of the present invention. Thus, the<br>
present invention is capable of implementation in many variations and modifications that<br>
can be derived from the description herein by a person skilled in the art. All such<br>
variations and modifications are considered to be within the scope and spirit of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
