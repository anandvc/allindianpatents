SAURER GmbH &amp; CO., KG. GERMAN Company LANDGRAFENSTRASSE 45, D-41069,<br>
MONCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY<br><br><br><br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Receiving Element for a Yarn Drawing Nozzle of an Open-Ended Rotor Spinning Device<br>
The invention relates to a receiving element in accordance with the preamble of claim 1.<br>
In connection with open-end spinning devices, yarn draw-off nozzles/ which are arranged exchangeably in a fiber channel plate which closes the rotor housing during the spinning operation/ have been known for a long time.<br>
DE 33 43 217 Al describes by way of example such a yarn draw-off nozzle, which can be exchangeably fixed in place in a fiber channel plate by means of a screw-thread arrangement.<br>
In this case the yarn draw-off nozzle consists of a base body as well as a wear-resistant inlet funnel.<br>
This means that the base body which, as a rule/ is made of metal, has a through-bore, into whose inlet side an inlet funnel, made for example of a ceramic material/ has been glued.<br>
The base body furthermore has an exterior screw thread for screwing the yarn draw-off nozzle into a central screw thread of the fiber channel plate, and an exterior hexagon head for attaching a corresponding tool.<br>
In principle, such yarn draw-off nozzles have proven themselves in actual use, but have the disadvantage that the exchange of such yarn draw-off nozzles is comparatively time-consuming, and that a tool is also required for changing these yarn draw-off nozzles.<br>
It has therefore already been suggested to fix yarn draw-off nozzles magnetically to the fiber channel plate or to a fiber channel plate adapter inserted in the fiber channel plate. For example, such magnetically attachable yarn draw-off nozzles have been extensively described in DE 27 45 195Al, DE 37 29 425 Al, DE 195 02 917 C2 or DE 195 32 735 Al.<br>
As can be seen in particular in DE 195 32 735 Al, such yarn draw-off nozzles consist of a ferromagnetic yarn draw- off nozzle holder, into whose through-bore a ceramic inlet funnel has been glued.<br>
In this case the yarn draw-off nozzle holder has a cylindrical shaft/ as well as an annular head element. Centering shoulders are arranged in the area of the head element, which work together with permanent magnet pins inserted into corresponding bores of the fiber channel plate. In the installed state of the yarn draw-off nozzle, the cylindrical shaft of the yarn draw-off nozzle holder is positioned in a corresponding through-bore of the fiber channel plate and is dependably secured against axial and rotatory displacement by the ferromagnetic centering shoulders or the permanent magnet pins.<br>
2<br><br>
The installation and removal of such magnetically fixed yarn draw-off nozzles is relatively simple and can be performed without an extensive outlay of time. Moreover, no tool is needed as a rule for exchanging such yarn draw-off nozzles.<br>
An open-end spinning device with a special fiber channel plate is furthermore described in DE 199 34 893 Al, which has a flange-like shoulder on the rear, on which a yarn draw-off tube can be releasably fixed in place. The fiber channel plate has a bore, which is conducted through the flange-like shoulder and is twice stepped at its entrance. The outside located step of the bore is provided with an interior screw thread.<br>
A receiving element for the yarn draw-off nozzle is fastened on this interior screw thread via a corresponding exterior screw thread.<br>
The yarn draw-off nozzle, which is arranged exchangeably in the receiving element, extends through the receiving element over its entire length and its end is supported in the stepped bore of the fiber channel plate.<br>
The manner of fastening of the yarn draw-off nozzle in the receiving element/ or further details regarding the receiving element cannot be found in DE 199 34 893 Al.<br>
Starting from the above mentioned prior art, the object of the invention is based on producing a receiving element which makes it possible to also fix magnetically arrestable yarn draw-off nozzles in a fiber channel plate which had originally been designed for receiving screwable yarn draw- off nozzles.<br>
In accordance with the invention, this object is attained by means of an adapter such as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the invention are the subject of the dependent claims.<br>
The receiving element embodied as an adapter has the particular advantage that fiber channel plates, which have a central threaded bore for receiving a yarn draw-off nozzle which can be screwed in, can also later be retrofitted without problems in such a way that a secure insertion of magnetically arrestable yarn draw-off nozzles is possible<br>
For this purpose, the adapter has a fastening element with an exterior thread, as well as a through-bore, and has a centering ring, which is rotatably seated in respect to the fastening element.<br>
In this case the interior diameter of the through-bore is matched to the exterior diameter of the shaft of a magnetically arrestable yarn draw-off nozzle.<br>
3<br><br>
The adapter furthermore has centering bores for receiving the ferromagnetic centering shoulders of the yarn draw-off nozzle.<br>
The adapter in accordance with the invention makes it possible to modify technically slightly outmoded fiber channel plates without a large time and material outlay in such a way that modern yarn draw-off nozzles can also be used.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment described in claim 2, the centering ring of the adapter is equipped with centering bores, as well as with at least one centering pin, wherein the centering pin works together with a respective centering bore in the fiber channel plate.<br>
This means that in the course of installing the adapter, the centering pin at the centering ring dependably engages the corresponding centering bore in the fiber channel plate and in this way sets the exact position of the centering bores of the centering ring.<br>
This means that the centering bores of the centering ring are exactly positioned in the area of permanent magnet pins which, as explained in claim 3, have been fixed in place in corresponding bores of the fiber channel plate.<br>
As explained in claim 4, the adapter is preferably made of aluminum.<br>
This material is not only very corrosion-resistant, but also relatively easy to work and relatively cost- effective.<br>
In what follows, the invention will be explained in greater detail by means of the exemplary embodiments represented in the drawings.<br>
Shown are in: Fig. 1, an open-end rotor spinning device in a lateral view, in which the adapter of the invention is employed,<br>
Fig. 2, an advantageous embodiment of the adapter of the invention with a magnetically arrestable yarn draw-off nozzle holder, as well as with a fiber channel plate equipped with an interior screw thread, partially in section,<br>
Fig. 3, an arrangement in accordance with Fig. 2, perspectively.<br>
The open-end rotor spinning device represented in Fig. 1 as a whole has the reference numeral 1.<br>
In a known manner the rotor spinning device has a rotor housing 2, in which the spinning cup of a spinning rotor 3 revolves at a high number of revolutions during the spinning operation. Here, the spinning rotor 3 is supported with its rotor shaft 4 in the bearing nip of a supporting ring bearing 5, and is operated by means of a tangential<br>
4<br><br>
belt 6, which extends over the length of the machine and is placed against it by means of a contact roller 7.<br>
The axial fixation of the motor shaft 4 preferably takes place via a permanent magnetic axial bearing 18.<br>
As is customary, the rotor housing 2, which per se is open at the front, is covered during the spinning operation by a pivotably seated cover element 8, into which a fiber channel plate 12 has been inserted with a seal 9. The rotor housing 2 is furthermore connected via an appropriate suction line 10 to a negative pressure source 11, which generates the negative spinning pressure required in the rotor housing 2.<br>
As indicated above,, a fiber channel plate 12 is arranged, preferably exchangeably, in the cover element 8, in which a yarn draw-off nozzle 13 has been fixed,, also exchangeably if required, to which a small yarn draw-of tube 15 is connected.<br>
In the customary manner, the fiber channel plate 12 furthermore contains the mouth area of a fiber guide channel 14.<br>
The cover element 8, which is seated, pivotable to a limited extent, around a pivot shaft 16, has an opening roller housing 17, as well as bearing brackets 19, 20, which are arranged on the rear for seating an opening roller 21, or a sliver draw-in cylinder 22.<br>
In this case the opening roller 21 is driven in the area of its wharve 23 by a revolving tangential belt 24 extending over the length of the machine, while the drive mechanism (not represented) of the sliver draw-in cylinder 22 is preferably performed by means of a worm drive gear arrangement which is connected to a drive shaft 25 extending over the length of the machine.<br>
As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3 in particular, the fiber channel plate 12 has a central threaded bore 37 with an interior screw thread 36, as well as a recess 32 on the inlet side. A receiving element in accordance with the invention, embodied as an adapter 26, can be fixed in place in this central threaded bore 37 by means of a corresponding exterior screw thread 35. In this case, the adapter 26 preferably has a two-piece embodiment and consists of a fastening element 42, as well as a centering ring 41 rotatably seated on the fastening element 42.<br>
The fastening element 42 has an exterior screw thread 35, as well as a through-bore 33.<br>
A centering pin 40 is arranged on the centering ring 41 which, in the installed state of the adapter 26, engages a corresponding centering bore 38 in the fiber channel plate 12 and aligns the centering pin 41 in such a way that the centering bores 21, also arranged in the centering ring 41, for the ferromagnetic centering shoulders 28 of the yarn draw-off nozzle<br>
5<br><br>
13 have been positioned congruently with the permanent magnet pins 30, which in turn have been fixed in place in bores in the fiber channel plate 12.<br>
In this case the interior diameter d of the through- bore 33 of the adapter 26 is matched to the exterior diameter D of the cylindrical shaft 39 of the yarn draw-off nozzle.<br>
The adapter 26 in accordance with the invention is here also screwed by means of the external screw thread 35 into the central threaded bore 37 of the fiber channel plate 12 of the open-end rotor spinning device 1.<br>
In this case the exterior screw thread 35 of the adapter 26 works together with the interior screw thread 36 of the fiber channel plate 12.<br>
It is possible to fix a magnetically arrestable yarn draw-off nozzle 13 without problems and in an easily exchangeable manner in place in the adapter 26.<br>
In this case the cylindrical shaft 39 of the base body 29 of the yarn draw-off nozzle 13 is seated in the through- bore 33 of the adapter 26 and its ferromagnetic centering shoulders 28 engage the centering bores 27 of the centering ring 41.<br><br><br>
