				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a water turbine and liquid pump for converting of<br>
potential energy of stored water to electrical energy or vice versa. Such an<br>
apparatus can also be called a flow machine (hydroelectric machine), which<br>
either can function as a water turbine with generator or as a motor with liquid<br>
pump.<br>
State of the art<br>
The document EP 0566787 is hereby incorporated by way of reference. However,<br>
the teachings of EP 0566787 do not relate to equipment suitable for use in tube-<br>
type water turbines or water pumps which are the subject matter of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Specifically, EP 0566787 concerns a submersible propulsion unit having two<br>
contra-rotating propellers rotatably attached to a shaft assembly disposed along<br>
the axis of rotation and a plurality of vane members for mounting said shaft<br>
assembly within a non-rotatable shroud or housing.<br>
The rotating units of the present invention are supported solely at their radial<br>
perimeter. Hence, the claimed subject matter is novel with regard to EP<br>
0566787.<br>
Swiss patent specification 606.793 describes an apparatus with a tube-type<br>
turbine or pump, which contains a single wheel with a mainly horizontal axis and<br>
with non-adjustable blades. With this flow machine one can, using it as a<br>
turbine, convert potential energy of stored water to electrical energy and, using<br><br>
it as a pump, convert electrical energy to kinetic energy in water. This solution<br>
however has low effectiveness.<br>
Swiss patent specification 606.801 describes a similar apparatus with a tube-type<br>
turbine or pump. With this apparatus, however, the blades of the wheel are<br>
carried out adjustable. With this flow machine the wheel is journalled in the inner<br>
of a stationery hub, which supports the guide blades and creates space for the<br>
end of the wheel's shaft. Neither this solution results in a satisfactory<br>
effectiveness.<br>
Form US-patent specification 3.353.028 (Braikevitch et al. 1964) it is known to<br>
mount a centrally supported turbine wheel with an outer ring which, by magnetic<br>
coupling, pulls with it a rotor ring with permanent magnets. The rotor ring is<br>
supported by ball bearings. Arranged upstream in front of the turbine wheel are<br>
stationary guide blades. This design is not exceptionally favourable, neither in<br>
view of the assembling costs nor in view of efficiency and maintenance.<br><br>
From US-patent specification 3.422.275 (Braikevitch et al. 1965) it is known<br>
a similar turbine which also is centrally supported and which is provided with<br>
adjustable guide blades, but as for the rest with a corresponding structure as<br>
the water turbine mentioned before.<br>
From SE-patent application 9600118 (Nilsson 1996) it is known to use two<br>
contra-rotating turbine wheels which are mechanically coupled with a fixed<br>
gearing. This turbine has a central support and axles which transmit the torque<br>
to an external generator. This design is fixed in view<br>
of its structure, the number of turbine wheels and operating condition and will<br>
have low efficiency.<br>
Object<br>
The main aim of the invention is to create a flow machine as quoted in the<br>
introduction, with the possibility for two or more contra-rotating wheels,<br>
where the machine can be used as a turbine and pump, and it is possible to<br>
obtain a better efficiency compared with corresponding known apparatuses.<br>
It is also an aim to create a rotor-stator structure and a bearing which makes it<br>
possible to avoid sealing solutions which can result in leakage and<br>
maintenance problems.<br>
Further it is an aim to create an apparatus which is prepared for modular<br>
design, so that a given apparatus can be assembled in a flexible way with<br>
modular units. Such modular units must be designed to be removed for the<br>
purpose of replacement or repairs with so little work as possible.<br><br>
Finally an apparatus of that kind in question must be able to be assembled with<br>
the lowest possible constructional and economical effort, which, among other<br>
things, requires a constructionally simple and cheap solution for the bearing<br>
of the rotating elements.<br>
Invention<br>
In the following the advantages of the invention are described especially in<br>
connection with the application as water turbine with generator. But<br>
corresponding effects can also be obtained with its use as a pump.<br>
With the use of the apparatus according to the invention it is possible, among<br>
other things by choice of a number of mutually independent, especially<br>
contra-rotating wheels, to convert energy in water with a considerably better<br>
efficiency than it is the case with the known apparatus. Additionally the<br>
apparatus according to the invention makes it possible to utilize higher<br>
pressures and/or head of water in an energy-relevant favourable manner than<br>
those which have been possible with the known water turbines, especially<br>
tube-type turbines.<br>
An important advantage consists in the possibility for better assembling of<br>
the generator units and the individual wheels than it is possible with the<br>
apparatus according to the Swedish patent application 9600118, and in this<br>
way to increase the efficiency.<br>
A further advantage consists in the kind of bearing which becomes more<br>
simple and requires less maintenance than known central bearings.<br><br>
Finally the use of modular units results in a more efficient production and<br>
assembling.<br>
For obtaining optimal results with energy conversion it is necessary to adapt<br>
the most important components of the flow machine according to the<br>
invention to the energy-relevant and constructional circumstances at the<br>
operational area.<br>
With the apparatus according to the invention, in the operating mode as a<br>
turbine, it will be obtained a reduction of the water pressure carried out<br>
stepwise, so that it is possible, with a corresponding combination of two or<br>
more turbine elements, which can be connected axially with each other, to<br>
obtain the best possible energy output and optimal efficiency of the energy<br>
conversion. The water which had flown through the wheels and has passed<br>
them contains practically no useable pressure and kinetic energy.<br>
Especially with the use of more than two turbine elements, a certain gradation<br>
of the degree of reaction of the following wheels may possibly be necessary<br>
to provide an optimal energy conversion.<br>
That what is described above in connection with the application of the flow<br>
machine as a turbine is in a corresponding way - with certain modifications<br>
and/or corresponding changes - also valid in case of its use as a pump, where<br>
the electrical generator becomes a motor.<br><br>
In connection with the water lubricated hydro dynamic gliding-surface bearing<br>
with which the apparatus according the invention is provided, it is found, that,<br>
also in the case of a sideways not completely closed design of the apparatus, not<br>
only the wanted bearing effect can be obtained, but additionally it is also possible,<br>
to obtain an operational permanent flow through this space between the moving<br>
and the non-moving elements - i.e. between the area of the rim of the rotating unit<br>
and the stationary part of the apparatus - in a certain flow direction. For obtaining<br>
such a function with gliding-surface bearings connections and understandings<br>
as known per se from the theory of hydrodynamics concerning bearings are<br>
used.<br>
With a preferred embodiment of the hydrodynamic gliding-surface bearing a part<br>
of the water which flows through the apparatus serves as a lubricant for the<br>
gliding-surface bearing. As for the rest it is also possible to design the gliding-<br>
surface bearings in such a way that the space between the parts of the gliding-<br>
surface bearing will be flown through in a predestined direction by the water<br>
which serves as a lubricant. In connection with such a design of the gliding-<br>
surface bearing it shall be added that, as a result of the continuous flow through<br>
the gap of the gliding-surface bearing, it can be obtained cooling of the coils of the<br>
generator or motor in question as well as cooling of the permanent magnets of the<br>
rotor can be achieved.<br>
For reducing the frictional losses the side areas concerned of such a gliding-<br>
surface bearing can be provided with a friction reducing coating, for example<br>
teflon or a material with similar effect. Such a coating can also be<br>
advantageous in case of the cylindrically formed bearing areas which is<br>
essential for the hydrodynamical counter pressure which generates supporting<br><br>
forces for the horizontally arranged rotating unit. This is because a<br>
hydrodynamic gliding-surface bearing reaches its effect only with a sufficient<br>
rotation/rotational speed of the moving element, so that from the beginning of<br>
its operation to that moment where this effect starts (lowest point in the<br>
Stribeck-diagram) there is a mixed friction the magnitude of which can be<br>
considerably reduced with a friction reducing coating at those surfaces which<br>
contact each other.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, the wheel of the flow machine,<br>
which is designed as a tube-type turbine, contains one outer bearing only, this<br>
means one bearing exclusively provided in the area of the rim of the rotating<br>
unit. Additionally it is also possible to arrange a bearing in the area of the<br>
hub of the wheel, if this should be necessary, e.g. to be able to mechanically<br>
adjust the blades of the wheel through the hub.<br>
To avoid unnecessary formation of vortexes and with it loss of energy and in<br>
addition to achieve a compact structure of the tube-type turbine the hub of the<br>
wheel has mainly the same outer cross-section. Moreover it is advantageous<br>
for this object, that the adjacent ends of the hubs of the wheel have a relatively<br>
short distance from each other.<br>
The coupling of the generator or rotor coils can be performed by electrical<br>
control circuits to optimize the energy conversion.<br>
Example<br>
In the following the figure is described more detailed by means of an example<br>
of an embodiment which is illustrated in accompanying figures 1-3, in which<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows schematically an apparatus according to the invention in a<br>
perspective view,<br>
Fig. 2 shows schematically and as a sectional view a partial area of the apparatus<br>
according to the invention, with rotating units and with stationary parts of the<br>
apparatus which are assigned to the rotating units, while<br>
Fig. 3 shows a sectional view of the partial area of the apparatus according to<br>
Fig. 2, viewed according to sectional line III-III in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an apparatus 1 according to the invention, which mainly consists<br>
of a bipartite tube-type turbine 2, a pressure chamber 3 which is arranged on<br>
its pressure side, that means at the entrance of the tube-type turbine 2, and a<br>
suction tube 4 which is arranged at the suction side which also is the exit of<br>
the tube-type turbine 2.<br>
While the pressure chamber 3 has a length, which is several times of its<br>
diameter, and a cross-section which mainly is constant about its length, the<br>
cross-section of the suction tube 4 widens towards its free end 5.<br>
The tube-type turbine 2, the pressure chamber 3 and the suction tube 4 are<br>
connected with each other and arranged at the set-up site in such a way, that<br>
they, in the case of the example, are lying in the same, mainly horizontal<br>
direction of their axles. This provides a best possible straight course of the<br>
water guidance from the entry of the water into the pressure chamber 3,<br>
respectively the tube-type turbine 2. until it leaves the suction tube 4, where<br>
the pressure chamber 3 serves for building up pressure in front of the turbine<br>
and to even out of the flow for obtaining a best possible pure irrotational flow.<br><br>
Fig. 2 shows the bipartite tube-type turbine 2 in a schematic representation and<br>
section. The tube-type turbine 2 consists of two turbine elements 6 and 7. The<br>
turbine elements 6, 7 contain a rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively, which are<br>
rotatably supported in a tube-like turbine housing 10 and 11, respectively, about<br>
a common geometric axis 12. For supporting of the rotating units 8 and 9 in the<br>
turbine housings 10 and 11, respectively, there is provided a hydrodynamic<br>
gliding-surface bearing - in the following referred to as "bearing" - 13 and 14,<br>
respectively. The bearings 13 and 14, respectively, enclose a gap 15 and 16,<br>
respectively, which contains the hydrodynamically effective liquid which so<br>
creates the hydrodynamic counter pressure and which on the one hand is<br>
formed of stationary areas 17 and 18, respectively, hence of areas of the<br>
turbine housing 10 and 11, respectively, of the apparatus 1, and on the other<br>
hand of the area 19 and 20, respectively, which are located on a rim 21 and 22,<br>
respectively, of the rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively. The gap 15 and 16,<br>
respectively, is formed so that during operation of the tube-type turbine 2 a flow<br>
through the gap 15 and 16, respectively, occurs by a part of the water which<br>
flows through the apparatus 1. In this way not only the wanted bearing effect<br>
will be obtained by formation of a corresponding counter pressure, but<br>
additionally the stator coils - and possibly also the permanent magnets of the<br>
rotor of the rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively - will be cooled. Hereby, it is<br>
possible with a corresponding design and course of the gap 15 and 16,<br>
respectively that the flow through the gap 15 and 16, respectively, occurs in a<br>
predestined direction, e.g. in that direction which is indicated by arrows 23 and<br>
24, respectively, in Fig. 2. For obtaining such a function the theory of<br>
hydrodynamics concerning bearings gives the theoretical basis, so it is not<br>
necessary to go into constructional details in this connection.<br><br>
The representation in Fig. 2 shows that the gap 15 and 16, respectively, of the<br>
bearing 13 and 14, respectively, is formed stepwise and unsymmetrically in<br>
relation to a radial midplane of the rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively.<br>
Additionally to the described constructional design of the bearing 13 and 14,<br>
respectively, these can be designed not only as axially effective bearings, but<br>
can also be designed for the taking of radial forces, which, with an<br>
embodiment as a tube-type turbine, are effective mainly in horizontal<br>
direction. The corresponding, not separately indicated annulus-formed areas<br>
of the flanks of the bearing 13 and 14, respectively, which on the one hand<br>
form areas of the rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively, and assigned stationary<br>
areas of the apparatus 1 on the other, but also the cylindrical areas which form<br>
the actual hydrodynamic bearing, can be coated with a friction reducing<br>
material, e.g. Teflon (trademark).<br>
The rotating unit 8 and 9, respectively, consists of a (bladed) wheel 25, 26<br>
respectively, said rim 21, 22 respectively, and a rotor 27, 28 respectively. The<br>
rotor 27, 28 respectively contains an annular row of permanent magnets 29,<br>
30 respectively. Around the rotor there is located a row of stator coils 31, 32<br>
respectively, which in this way form the stator of the generator. The stator<br>
coils 31, 32 are fastened within a ring which is tight against the ring track 44,<br>
45 respectively, in the turbine housing 10, 11. The rotor 27, 28 is connected<br>
each separately with the concerned rim 21, 22 respectively, to a unit and forms<br>
the most important element together with the stator in question.<br>
The wheel 25 mainly consists of a hub 33, non-adjustable blades (vanes) 34<br>
fixed on the hub 33, and a rim 21 which firmly connects the outer ends of the<br>
blades 34 with each other.<br><br>
The wheel 26 mainly consists of a hub 35, blades (vanes) 36 which are non-<br>
adjustable, and which are fastened to the hub, and the rim 22 which connects<br>
the outer ends of the blades 36.<br>
The blades 34 of the wheel 25 are designed so and adjusted/aligned in such a<br>
way in relation to the geometric axis 12 of the hub 33, that they have an effect<br>
on the flow according to arrow 37 hitting the pressure side of the wheel 25 in<br>
a counter-clockwise direction. The extent of this effect naturally depends<br>
mainly on of the load of the wheel 25, i.e. on the power withdrawal from the<br>
generator concerned. In contrast the blades 36 of the wheel 26 are designed<br>
so and adjusted/aligned in such a way in relation to the geometric axis 12 of<br>
the hub 35, that they have an effect on the flow, which leaves the suction side<br>
of the wheel 25 and immediately afterwards reaches the pressure side of the<br>
wheel 25, in a clockwise direction. These two wheels 25, 26 immediately<br>
following each other within the tube-type turbine 2 consequently rotate with<br>
mutually opposite directions of rotation.<br>
The hubs 33, 35 of the wheels 25, 26 respectively, have - viewed in a radial<br>
direction - at least essentially the same cross-section and preferably enclose a<br>
relatively small space in the area of their adjacent ends 38, 39.<br>
Further the wheels 25, 26 are preferably provided with the same number of<br>
blades 34 and 36, respectively. Also with regard to the choice of the number<br>
of permanent magnets 29 and 30, respectively, being fastened to the rotors<br>
27, 28 preferably the same number of magnets is provided. Dependent on the<br>
individual energy conditions at the mounting place and dependent on the<br><br>
manner in which the electricity generation occurs by the tube-type turbine, it<br>
also can be suitable to choose the number of the blades 34 and 36,<br>
respectively, and/or the number of the permanent magnets 29 and 30,<br>
respectively, on the rotors 27, 28 of both of the turbine elements 6, 7 - or rather<br>
several turbine elements - as different. Relevant to this is also the possibility to<br>
electrically connect the coils 31 and 32, respectively, either in series or<br>
parallel.<br>
The turbine housings 10, 11, which are arranged for containing each of a<br>
rotating unit 8, 9 respectively, is preferably designed similar, preferably<br>
annular, and are provided with cooperating connection flanges 40 and 41,<br>
respectively, with connection drill holes 42 and 43, respectively, which are<br>
indicated in the drawing and which serve for mounting of the connection<br>
bolts, not shown. In this manner it is possible, depending on a set of<br>
components, to connect two or more turbine elements with each other as well<br>
as with a suction tube and a pressure chamber, respectively, providing one<br>
end being designed correspondingly, to a complete apparatus. The turbine<br>
housings 10, 11 are dividable in a radial plane with the ring track 44, 45, so<br>
that the wheel with the rotor can be mounted and removed.<br>
Further there can be provided known electrical circuit means in the electrical<br>
circuits of the coils - being connected in series or parallel - 31, 32 of the<br>
generators for optimizing the energy conversion by the apparatus, e.g. circuit<br>
elements for distributing of the energy withdrawal on the generators of the<br>
individual turbine elements, with a corresponding reaction on the wheel concerned<br>
and to optimize the energy yield or the total blade power.<br><br>
Designed as a pump the apparatus according to the invention can be used in<br>
connection with a hydroelectric power plant or as driving unit for boats.<br>
Also the apparatus can be designed in such a way that the wheels rotate in the same<br>
direction by insertion of a stationary element with guide blades between these wheels.<br>
Also here increasing of the efficiency can be obtained by individually controlling of<br>
the wheels. The guide blades can also be provided with an adjustable slope.<br><br>
