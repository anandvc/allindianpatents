				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
organic chemistry. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to tertiary phosphines and their methods of<br>
preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND:<br>
Tertiary phosphines find utility in several areas<br>
of organic chemistry, for example as starting materials for<br>
making phosphonium salts and ylids and as ligands in<br>
metal-carbene catalysts.<br>
Some bulky tertiary phosphines, such as<br>
tricyclohexylphosphine, have been reported to be useful as<br>
catalyst ligands. For example, bulky tertiary phosphines<br>
find utility as ligands for metal catalysts, such as the<br>
ruthenium-based Grubbs catalyst (named after its inventor,<br>
Robert H. Grubbs). Notably, metal-carbene catalysts having<br>
tertiary phosphine ligands can be used as catalysts in<br>
several types of reactions, including: olefin metathesis<br>
reactions (for a recent review, see Rouhi, A. M. (2002)<br>
Chemical and Engineering News. pp. 29-33; see also: Grubbs<br>
et al. (1995) Ace. Chem. Res., vol. 28, p.446-452; Grubbs et<br>
al. (1998) Tetrahedron, vol. 54, pp. 4413-4450; Chatterjee<br>
et al. (1999) Org. Lett. Vol. 1, pp. 1751-1753);<br>
palladium-catalysed Suzuki cross couplings (Nethrton et al.<br>
(2001) J. Am.. Chem. Soc, vol. 123, pp. 10099-10100; Littke<br>
et al. (2000) J. Am. Chem. Soc, vol. 122, pp. 4020-4028);<br>
and palladium-catalysed Heck reactions (A.F. Littke and<br>
G.C. Fu, (1999) J. Org. Chem., vol. 64, pp. 10-11; Cabri et<br>
al. (1995) Ace. Chem. Res., vol. 28, pp. 2-7).<br><br>
A variety of tertiary phosphines can be prepared<br>
by reacting phosphorus trichloride with a Grignard reagent<br>
or with an organolithium compound, followed by aqueous<br>
workup, extraction and distillation. However, these<br>
processes have several disadvantages, in that materials used<br>
in these processes are expensive, corrosive, difficult to<br>
prepare owing to their sensitivity to moisture, and<br>
cumbersome to handle on a large scale. In addition, these<br>
processes generate large amount of waste. Further, these<br>
processes usually proceed quickly to the tertiary phosphine<br>
and are ideal for preparing a tertiary phosphine having<br>
identical radicals but are less suitable for preparing a<br>
tertiary phosphine having a particular composition of<br>
non-identical radicals.<br>
Alternatively, phosphine gas (PH3) can be reacted<br>
with an alkene under free radical conditions to produce<br>
primary, secondary and tertiary phosphines. This process<br>
advantageously avoids the use of organometallic compounds.<br>
However, this process may be less suitable for producing<br>
certain tertiary phosphines, such as tertiary phosphines<br>
that have several sterically bulky radicals attached to the<br>
central phosphorus atom. For example, addition of<br>
cyclohexene to PH3 under free radical conditions favours the<br>
production of dicyclohexylphosphine and provides poor yields<br>
of tricyclohexylphosphine.<br>
There have been some reports in the literature<br>
describing the preparation of cyclic and bicyclic tertiary<br>
phosphines (i.e. where the phosphorus atom is a ring member<br>
in a cyclic or bicyclic structure, respectively) via double<br>
Michael-additions of primary phosphines to conjugated<br>
dienones (Y. Kashman and Benady, E. (1972) Tetrahedron, vol.<br>
28, pp. 4091-4098; E. Y. Zabotina et al. (2001) Tetrahedron,<br>
vol. 57, pp. 10177-10180; and WO 02/064249). However, this<br><br>
approach is limited to the preparation of cyclic and<br>
bicyclic phosphines.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:<br>
Compounds of formula I<br>
Suitable hydrocarbyl groups for R1, R2, R7, and R8,<br>
include: unsubstituted or substituted C1-C30 alkyl;<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C3-C8 cycloalkyl; unsubstituted<br>
or substituted C2-C30 alkenyl; unsubstituted or substituted<br>
C2-C30 alkynyl; unsubstituted or substituted. C6-C18 aryl;<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C7-C30 aralkyl; unsubstituted or<br>
substituted C2-C30 heteroalkyl containing one or two<br>
heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N, 0 or S;<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C3-C8 heterocycle containing one<br>
or two heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N,<br>
O or S; unsubstituted or substituted C3-C30 heteroalkenyl<br>
containing one or two heteroatoms selected from the group<br>
consisting of N, O or S; unsubstituted or substituted C3-C30<br>
heteroalkynyl containing one or two heteroatoms selected<br>
from the group consisting of N, O or S; unsubstituted or<br>
substituted C6-C18 heteroaryl containing one or two<br>
heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N, O or S;<br>
unsubstituted or substituted C7-C30 heteroaralkyl containing<br><br>
one or two heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of<br>
N, O or S. For the most part, it is contemplated that<br>
hydrocarbyl groups shall have not more than 20 carbon atoms.<br>
R1 and R2 and the phosphorus atom to which R1 and R2<br>
are bonded can form a six- to eight-membered heterocycle, a<br>
seven- to- ten membered heterobicycle, or a ten membered-<br>
heterotricycle. Similarly, when both R7 and R8 are<br>
hydrocarbyl, R7 and R8 and the phosphorus atom to which R7<br>
and R8 are bonded can form a six- to eight-membered<br>
heterocycle , a seven- to ten-membered heterobicycle, or a<br>
ten-membered heterotricycle.<br>
It is possible for the groups R1, R2, R7, and R8, to<br>
bear substituents, or to include heteroatoms, provided that<br>
the substituents or heteroatoms do not interfere with the<br>
preparation of the compounds of the invention, and do not<br>
adversely affect the desired properties of the tertiary<br>
phosphine. Acceptable substituents may include hydroxyl,<br>
halo, alkoxy, alkylthio, carboxy, and acetyl groups, and<br>
heteroatoms that may be acceptable include nitrogen, oxygen<br>
and sulphur. If necessary, one of skill in the art can<br>
readily determine whether substituents of heteratoms of the<br>
hydrocarbyl groups interfere with preparation or desired<br>
properties of the compounds by routine experimentation that<br>
does not involve the exercise of any inventive faculty.<br>
In many cases, R1, R2, R7, and R8 will be<br>
unsubstituted C1-C18 alkyl, unsubstituted C3-C8 cycloalkyl, or<br>
unsubstituted C6-C10 aryl. Thus, specific examples of values<br>
for R1, R2, R7, and R8, include: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl,<br>
iso-pentyl, cyclopentyl, n-hexyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl,<br>
norbornyl, (2, 4 , 4'-trimethyl)pentyl, cyclooctyl, tetradecyl,<br>
etc.<br><br>
Examples of heterobicycles that can be formed when<br>
the phosphorus atom is bonded to R7 and R8 include: 9-<br>
phosphabicyclo[3.3.l]nonane, 9-phosphabicyclo[4. 2.1]nonane,<br>
9-phosphabicyclo[3.3 -1]nonan-3-one, 4, 8-dimethyl-2-<br>
phosphabicyclo[3.1.l]nonane, and 2,5-di(C1-C4 alkyl)-7-<br>
phosphabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. Examples of heterotricycles<br>
that can be formed when the phosphorus atom is bonded to R7<br>
and R8 include: 1, 3, 5,7-tetra (C1-C4 alkyl)-2,4,8-trioxa-6-<br>
phosphaadamantane.<br>
Examples of heterobicycles that can be formed when<br>
the phosphorus atom is bonded to R1 and R2 include: 9-<br>
phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]non-9-yl, 9-phosphabicyclo[4.2 .1] non-9-<br>
yl, 9-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-on-9-yl, 4,8-dimethyl-2-<br>
phosphabicyclo[3.1.l]non-9-yl, and 2,5-di(C1-C4 alkyl)-7~<br>
phosphabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-7-yl. Examples of heterotricycles<br>
that can be formed when the phosphorus atom is bonded to R1<br>
and R2 include: 1,3,5,7-tetra (Ci-C4 alkyl)-2,4,8-trioxa-6-<br>
phosphaadamant-6-yl.<br>
R4 can bear substituents or include heteroatoms,<br>
provided that the substituents or heteroatoms do not<br>
interfere with the preparation or use of'the compound.<br>
Acceptable substituents may include halo, and hydroxy, as<br>
well as hydrocarbyl groups such as alkyl, alkenyl and<br>
cycloalkyl groups, heteroatoms that may be acceptable<br>
include N, 0 and S. Mention is made of C1-C8 alkyl and<br>
alkenyl groups, straight chained or branched, C3-C8<br>
cycloalkyl groups, and aryl groups such as phenyl or<br>
napthyl, aralkyl groups such as benzyl or phenethyl and<br>
alkaryl groups such as tolyl or xylyl. Other substituents<br>
include acyl, acyloxy, alkoxy, alkenoxy and aryloxy groups,<br>
again having up to about 8 carbon atoms. Substituents that<br>
are electron-withdrawing, for instance fluoro, hydroxy,<br>
trifluoromethyl, cyano, alkylcarbonyl and alkoxycarbonyl,<br><br>
may favour the reaction for preparing compounds of<br>
formula I. To avoid steric interference, R4 can be chosen so.<br>
that bulky .substituents are not present on the carbon atom<br>
that is immediately adjacent to the R5-bearing carbon atom<br>
(i.e. the carbon atom that bonds to the phosphorus atom). R4<br>
can be unsaturated, provided that R4 is chosen so that the<br>
compound of formula III has. no mnore than one C=C .double bond,<br>
conjugated with a carbonyl group and further that R3 does not<br>
have a C=C double bond conjugated with a carbonyl group.<br>
Thus, suitable values for R4 include but are not<br>
limited to ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) , propylene (-CH2-CH2-CH2-) ,<br>
and (-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-) , and suitable values for R3 when<br>
it is a five- to eight-membered ring include 3-oxo-<br>
cyclopentyl, 3-oxo-cyclohexyl, and 3-dxo-cyclooctyl.<br>
Examples of compounds of formula III when it is a<br>
five- to eight-membered ring include 2-cyclopenten-l-one,<br>
2-cyclohexen-l-one, 2-cycloocten-l-one, isophorone (i.e.<br>
3, 5, 5-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen-l-one) , carvonone (i.e.<br>
2-methyl-5-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-l-one) , and<br>
dihydro-carvanone (i.e. 2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl)-<br>
2-cyclohexen-l-one)<br>
In the present context, two rings are said to be<br>
"fused" if they have one bond common to both rings. Thus,<br>
suitable values for R3 when it is a fused bicycle having two<br>
or three fused five- or six-membered rings include:<br><br><br>
Examples of compounds of formula III when it is a<br>
fused bicycle having two or three fused five- or<br>
six-membered rings include:<br><br>
In the present context, a "bridged" bicyclic<br>
compound is a compound in which a bridge of atom(s) extends<br>
from one side of a ring to the other. Thus, suitable values<br>
for R3 when it is a seven- to eight-membered bridged bicycle<br>
include:<br><br>
Examples of compounds of formula III when it is a<br>
seven- to eight-membered bridged bicycle include verbenone:<br><br>
Suitable hydrocarbyl groups for R5 include: methyl,<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, and n-butyl. However, R5 is preferably<br>
hydrogen or methyl, and more preferably R5 is hydrogen.<br><br>
Suitable hydrocarbyl groups for R6 include: methylr<br>
ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl and<br>
tert-butyl. However, when R6 is bulky, it may interfere with<br>
the rate of reaction of a compound of formula III with a<br>
phosphine of formula II. Therefore, in many cases it is<br>
preferred that R6 is hydrogen or methyl, and more preferred<br>
that R6 is hydrogen.<br>
There is no critical upper limit to the number of<br>
carbon atoms that may be present in the compounds of<br>
formula I. However, for the most part it is contemplated<br>
that compounds of formula I shall contain no more than about<br>
30 carbon atoms.<br>
Tertiary phosphine compounds of formula I that may<br>
find utility, for example, as catalyst ligands and as<br>
starting materials for making phosphonium salts and ylids.<br>
It is noted that the R groups in tertiary phosphines of<br>
formula I can be the same or different, i.e. the tertiary<br>
phosphine can have identical or mixed radicals. The<br>
properties of the tertiary phosphine can be modified by<br>
varying the values and mixture of the R groups present on<br>
the phosphorus atom.<br>
Tertiary phosphines having sterically bulky R<br>
groups are preferred in some applications. For example,<br>
bulky electron-rich tertiary phosphines may be preferred as<br>
catalyst ligands, e.g. for metal catalysts of reactions<br>
including but not limited to olefin metathesis, palladium-<br>
catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling, palladium-catalyzed Heck<br>
reactions, hydroformylations, and carbonylations. For this<br>
reason, it may be preferred that R1 and R2 are cyclic,<br>
branched, or aromatic, or together with the phosphorus atom<br>
to which they are bonded form heterocycles, heterobicycles<br>
or heterotricycles. Branching can occur at the alpha or<br><br>
omega carbon or at any intermediate point. Sterically bulky<br>
R groups include branched C4-C18 alkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, and<br>
C6-C10 aryl, any of which may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted, but for the most part will be unsubstituted.<br>
Thus, specific examples of sterically bulky R groups<br>
include: iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl,--iso-pentyl,<br>
_cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl phenyl, norbornyl, cyclooctxl,<br>
(2, 4, 4'-trimethyl)pentyl, etc. Sterically bulky<br>
heterobicycles include: 9-phosphobicyclo[3.3.1]non-9-yl,<br>
9-phosphabicyclo[4.2.1]non-9-yl,<br>
9-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-on-9-yl,<br>
4,8-dimethyl-2-phosphabicyclo[3.1.l]non-9-yl, and 2,5-<br>
di(C1-C4 alkyl)-7-phosphabicyclo[2.2.l]hept-7-yl. Sterically<br>
bulky heterotricycles that 'can be formed when the phosphorus<br>
atom is bonded to R1 and R2 include: 1,3,5,7-<br>
tetra (C1-C4 alkyl) -2, 4, 8-trioxa-6-phosphaadamant-6-yl.<br>
Method for preparing compounds of formula I<br>
Tertiary phosphines of formula I can be prepared<br>
by reacting a phosphihe of formula II (PH3 or a primary or<br>
secondary phosphine, hereinafter referred to as a "starting<br>
phosphine") with an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound<br>
of formula III having no more than one C=C double bond<br>
conjugated with a carbonyl group. By "conjugated" double<br>
bonds, we mean two double bonds separated by a single bond<br>
i.e. C=C-C=C, C=C-C=0, etc. Compounds with a C=C double<br>
bond conjugted with a C=0 group are known in the art as<br>
alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds.<br>
In general, the reaction proceeds over a wide<br>
range of temperatures, say between about 40°C to about 180°C,<br>
often in the range of 50°C to 70°C, and is often complete in<br><br>
8 hours or less at these temperatures. Although the<br>
temperature of the reaction is not critical, lower<br>
temperatures will result in longer reaction times. When the<br>
reaction is carried out in the liquid phase at ambient<br>
pressure, there may be a practical upper limit to the<br>
reaction temperature that can be used, based on the<br>
respective boiling points of the alpha,beta unsaturated<br>
carbonyl compound and starting phosphine reagents. The<br>
initial step of mixing the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl<br>
compound and the starting phosphine reagents may be<br>
conveniently carried out at room temperature or slightly<br>
elevated temperature.<br>
When the starting phosphine of formula II is<br>
liquid at the temperature to be used for carrying out the<br>
reaction, the pressure of the reaction is not critical, and<br>
the reaction may be conveniently carried out at atmospheric<br>
pressure, preferably under an inert atmosphere, such as<br>
nitrogen. However, when the starting phosphine is a gas at<br>
the temperature to be used for carrying out the reaction,<br>
the reaction is suitably carried out under pressure (e.g. in<br>
an autoclave) under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen.<br>
For example, PH3 is a gas with boiling point of about -87°C<br>
and some primary and secondary phosphines with small R<br>
groups (such as methylphosphine which has a boiling point of<br>
-20°, ethylphosphine, dimethylphosphine, and<br>
diethylphosphine) have low boiling points and may be gaseous<br>
at the temperature to be used for carrying out the reaction.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the absence of<br>
solvent, in order to avoid a further step of purifying<br>
product away from solvent. However, the reaction can also<br>
be carried out in the presence of a solvent. In some cases,<br>
the presence of a solvent may be useful for controlling the<br>
temperature of the reaction, which is exothermic. Examples<br><br>
of suitable solvents include: toluene, ethanol, isopropanol,<br>
butanol, dimethylformamide, tributylphosphate,<br>
tritylphosphine oxide.<br>
Unreacted starting materials may be removed, for<br>
example, by evaporation under vacuum.<br>
The properties of the reagents may affect The<br>
overall course of the reaction. For example, the increased<br>
steric bulk of R3 when it bears substituents may decrease the<br>
rate of reaction. This effect may be counteracted somewhat<br>
if the substituents have electron-withdrawing properties.<br>
Increased steric bulk around the phosphorus atom may<br>
decrease the overall rate of reaction. The presence of<br>
electron-withdrawing groups on the starting phosphine of<br>
formula II may also decrease the overall rate of reaction.<br>
In many cases, the reaction proceeds readily<br>
without further addition of a promoter (i.e. an acid<br>
promoter or a base promoter). However, in some cases, for<br>
example where the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds<br>
of formula III or the phosphine is sterically hindered,<br>
adding an acid promoter or base promoter may enhance the<br>
rate of the reaction.<br>
In one embodiment, the method of the current<br>
invention can be used to prepare tertiary phosphines that<br>
have bulky radicals, identical or mixed (i.e.<br>
non-identical). Tertiary phosphines having bulky radicals<br>
may find utility as catalyst ligands, e.g. for metal-carbene<br>
catalysts. Notably, tertiary phosphines having mixed<br>
radicals provide possibilities for catalyst ligands that<br>
have not yet been explored, due to the relative<br>
inaccessibility of tertiary phosphine ligands having mixed<br>
radicals.<br><br>
The tertiary phosphines described herein may also<br>
find utility as starting materials, for example for making<br>
phosphonium salts or ylids.<br>
The invention is further illustrated in the<br>
following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1: Preparation of<br>
3-(di(iso-butyl)phosphino)cyclohexan-l-one<br>
A 250 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a<br>
condenser, nitrogen purge, and addition funnel was charged<br>
with 29.9 g (0.3 mol) 2-cyclohexen-l-one and heated to 45°C<br>
with stirring. Di-(iso-butyl)phosphine (28.8 g, 0.2 mol)<br>
was gradually added to the flask via the addition funnel,<br>
over a period of 0.5 hour. When addition was complete, the<br>
temperature of the contents of the flask was slowly raised<br>
to 70°C and maintained at that temperature for 3 hours, then<br>
cooled. Unreacted starting materials were removed by<br>
evaporation under reduced pressure at 120°C.<br>
The product of the reaction was analyzed by 1H,<br>
13C, and 31P NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and<br>
GC/MS (Gas chromatography mass spectrometry)<br>
Di- (iso-butyl)phosphinocyclohexan-l-one was<br>
obtained in 70.9 % yield (55.1 g)<br>
Example 2: Preparation of<br>
3-(dicyclohexylphosphino)cyclohexan-1-one<br>
A 250 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a<br>
condenser, nitrogen purge, and addition funnel was charged<br>
with a solution of 89.7 g (0.45 mol) dicyclohexylphosphine<br>
and heated to 60°C with stirring. To the flask was added<br>
50.8 g (0.53 mol) 2-cyclohexen-l-one over a period of 0.5<br><br>
hour. When addition was complete, the temperature of the<br>
contents of the flask was slowly raised to 90°C and<br>
maintained at that temperature for 6 hours, then cooled.<br>
Unreacted starting materials were removed by evaporation<br>
under reduced pressure at 150°C.<br>
The product of the reaction was analyzed by 1H,<br>
13C, and 31P and GC/MS.<br>
Dicyclohexylphosphinocyclohexan-1-one was obtained<br>
in 98.3 % yield (140.5 g) and solidified to form a fine<br>
white powder.<br>
Example 3: Preparation of<br>
3- (9-phosphabicyclo [3.3.1] nonan-9-yl) -cyclohexan-1-one<br>
2-cyclohexenone (19.2 g, Aldrich, 95%, Mt. 96.13,<br>
0.1897 mole) was added dropwise to a flask containing<br>
9-phospha-cyclo[3.3.1]nonane (72.8 g, 37%, Mt. 142,<br>
0.1897mole) and toluene under nitrogen flow and at 120 °C,<br>
with stirring. The temperature of the reaction mixture was<br>
gradually increased to 160°C, accompanied by stripping off<br>
the toluene through the additional funnel.. The reaction<br>
mixture was further refluxed at 160 CC for 9 hours. GC/MS<br>
showed that the 2-cyclohexenone was almost consumed. The<br>
crude product was dried on rotary-evaporator at 170 °C and<br>
5mmHg for 2 hours. The dried product was solid at room<br>
temperature and weighted 45 g (yield 99 %) .<br>
The product of the reaction was analyzed by 1H,<br>
13C, and 31P (see Figures 1 to 3) , confirming that the major<br>
product was 3- (9-phosphabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-yl)-<br>
cyclohexan-1-one.<br><br>
Example 4: Preparation of<br>
di (cyclohexanon-3-yl) -cyclohexylphosphine<br>
Cyclohexylphosphine (17.0 g, 98%, Mt. 116, 0.1436<br>
mole) was added gradually (i.e. over a 30-hour period)<br>
through an additional funnel to a flask containing<br>
cycliohexenone (27 9g 95% M.T 96-.13,O. 2757 mole<br>
preheated (150 °C) solution in toluene (33 g), under<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The reaction was followed by GC-MS analysis. Upon<br>
completion of addition of the cyclohexylphosphine, GC/MS<br>
showed peaks for compounds with molecular weights 212 and<br>
308, corresponding respectively to the molecular weights of<br>
cyclohexylphosphinocyclhexan-1-one (the mono-substituted<br>
product) and di (cyclohexanon-3-yl) -cyclohexylphosphine (the<br>
di-susbtituted product) . The mixture was refluxed for a<br>
further 8 hours. GC/MS analysis showed that the reaction<br>
mixture contained about 60% of the di(cyclohexanon-2-yl)-<br>
cyclohexylphosphine product.<br><br>
