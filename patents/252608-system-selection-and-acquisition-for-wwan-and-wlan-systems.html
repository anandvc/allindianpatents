QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, an American Company of 5775<br>
Morehouse Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1714,<br>
United States of America<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
SYSTEM SELECTION AND ACQUISITION FOR<br>
WWAN AND WLAN SYSTEMS<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001] The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60/691,947 entitled "Addition of WLAN System information in the PRL (Preferred Roaming List) and user's private WLAN system list to enact" filed June 17, 2005 hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically to techniques for performing system selection and acquisition by a wireless device.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003] Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various communication services such as voice, packet data, and so on. These wireless systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access systems include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, and Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems. A CDMA system may implement one or more CDMA standards such as IS-2000 and IS-95 (commonly called "lx-EV-DV", or simply "lx"), IS-856 (commonly called "lx-EV-DO"), and so on, which are known in the art.<br>
[0004] A wireless device (e.g., a cellular phone) that supports lx and/or lx-EV-DO typically maintains a preferred roaming list (PRL). This PRL contains information to assist the wireless device perform system selection and acquisition in lx and lx-EV-DO systems, particularly when the wireless device is roaming. The PRL identifies "permitted" systems that the wireless device should use and (optionally) "forbidden" systems that the wireless device should not use.<br>
[0005] The PRL format for lx is described in a document TIA/EIA/IS-683-A, entitled "Over-the-Air Service Provisioning of Mobile Stations in Spread Spectrum<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br><br>
Standards," June 1998, which is publicly available. The PRL format for lx-EV-DO is described in a document TIA-683-C, entitled "Over-the-Air Service Provisioning of Mobile Stations in Spread Spectrum Standards," March 2003, which is also publicly available. TIA-683-C defines (1) a PRL format that is based on IS-683-A and can convey PRL information for lx systems and (2) an extended PRL format that can convey PRL information for both lx and IxEV-DO systems. TTA-683-C is backward compatible with IS-683-A.<br>
[0006] A wireless device that stores an extended PRL is able to select and acquire lx and lx-EV-DO systems. However, the wireless device would not be able to select and acquire other systems not covered by TIA-683-C.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Techniques for performing system selection and acquisition for wireless wide area network (WWAN) systems as well as wireless local area network (WLAN) systems are described herein. The WWAN systems may be lx systems, IxEV-DO systems, and/or some other types of systems. The WLAN systems may be IEEE 802.11 systems and/or some other types of systems.<br>
[0008] In an aspect, a PRL carries system records and acquisition records for WWAN and WLAN systems. One or more new types of system record and one or more new types of acquisition record may be defined for WLAN. The PRL and new system and acquisition records may be defined to be backward compatible with TIA-683-C. System and acquisition information for WLAN systems may be stored in the new system and acquisition records, respectively, which are included in the PRL. The PRL may be programmed into a wireless device and/or may be sent over the air in the normal manner. Security-related information used to perform encryption and/or authentication for WLAN systems may be stored in a separate WLAN authentication profile table. The system record for each WLAN system may indicate an acquisition record and a profile record applicable for that WLAN system.<br>
[0009] In another aspect, a network identifier table stores system records and profile records for WLAN systems and possibly other types of systems. The system records carry information used for system selection and acquisition. The system records in the network identifier table do not need to be backward compatible with TIA-683-C and may be defined to carry pertinent information in an efficient manner.   The profile<br><br>

systems.<br>

detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022] The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any embodiment or design described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs.<br>
[0023] FIG. 1 shows a deployment with a WWAN 100 and a WLAN 102. WWAN 100 provides communication coverage for a large geographic area, e.g., a city, a state, and so on. WLAN 102 provides communication coverage for a smaller geographic area, e.g., a mall, a campus, a store, and so on. The coverage area of WWAN 100 may or may not overlap the coverage area of WLAN 102.<br>
[0024] WWAN 100 may be a lx network, a lxEV-DO network, or some other type of network. WWAN 100 includes one or more systems, and each system includes one or more smaller networks. Each system within a lx network is identified by a system<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br><br>
identification (SID) value, and each smaller network of each lx system is identified by a network identification (NID) value. The systems and networks in a IxEV-DO network are identified using a subnet-ID, which may be up to 128 bits long and follow IPv6 representation format as described in RFC2460, entitled "Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) Specification," December 1998. The term "network" and "system" are sometimes used interchangeably.<br>
[0025] WWAN 100 typically includes many base stations 110 that support communication for wireless devices 120 within the coverage area of the WWAN. For simplicity, only three base stations 110 are shown in FIG. 1 for WWAN 100. A base station is a fixed station that communicates with the wireless devices and may also be called a base transceiver station (BTS) (lx terminology), an access point (IxEV-DO terminology), or some other terminology. Wireless devices 120 are located throughout the coverage areas of WWAN 100. A wireless device may also be called a mobile station (lx terminology), a user/access terminal (IxEV-DO terminology), a user equipment (UE), a mobile equipment (ME), a subscriber unit, or some other terminology. A wireless device may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a handset, and so on. A mobile switching center (MSC) 130 provides coordination and control for base stations 110 in WWAN 100. <br>
[0026] WLAN 102 may be an IEEE 802.11 network or some other type of network. WLAN 102 may implement one or more standards such as IEEE Std 802.1 la-1999 (commonly called "802.11a"), IEEE Std 802.11b-1999 (commonly called "802.11b"), IEEE Std 802.1 lg-2003 (commonly called "802.1lg"), and so on, which are known in the art. WLAN 102 may include one or more systems, depending on the deployment size of the WLAN. Each system is identified by a service set identifier (SSID) that may be up to 32 bytes long. WLAN 102 includes one or more access points 112 that support communication for wireless terminals 122 (e.g., laptop computers) and wireless devices 120 within the coverage area of the WLAN. For simplicity, only three access points 112 are shown in FIG. 1 for WLAN 102. For a centralized architecture, a system controller 132 provides coordination and control for access points 112 in WLAN 102. [0027] For lx and IxEV-DO, a wireless device maintains a preferred roaming list (PRL) for system selection and acquisition. The wireless device may be programmed with the PRL via a serial or USB interface, e.g., during manufacturing or activation. The wireless device may also download the PRL over the air and/or may obtain the PRL from a removable module inserted into the wireless device. The wireless device stores<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
the PRL in a non-volatile memory, which may be in the wireless device or the removable module.<br>
[0028] FIG. 2 shows a PRL 200 having the structure used in IS-683-A and TIA-683-C. PRL 200 includes a system table 210 and an acquisition table 250. System table 210 includes a list of permitted and forbidden systems/networks, which is organized by geographic areas (GEOs). For clarity, FIG. 2 shows each geographic area being represented by a respective tabbed table. Each tabbed table includes a section 220 for preferred systems/networks that the wireless device should access and a section 230 for forbidden systems/networks that the wireless device should not access. <br>
[0029] The system table and acquisition table have different formats for lx and lxEV-DO. FIG. 2 shows the PRL format for lx. The tabbed table for each geographic area includes (1) one or more records for one or more systems/networks in the geographic area and (2) multiple fields for pertinent information for each record. These fields include a system field, a selection preference field, a roaming indication field, and an acquisition index field. For each record, the system field stores the (SID, NID) pair assigned to the system/network associated with that record. The selection preference field indicates the preference for the associated system/network among all of the permitted systems/networks within the same geographic area. The network operator typically specifies the preference. The roaming indication field specifies how a roaming indicator on the wireless device should be displayed when receiving a signal from the associated system/network. The acquisition index field stores an index value that points to a specific record in acquisition table 250 containing the parameters to use to acquire the associated system/network. Acquisition table 250 includes one record for each unique index value. Each acquisition record includes multiple fields for various parameters used for system acquisition. The acquisition records for different types of system have different formats.<br>
[0030] FIG. 2 shows a graphical representation of a PRL for lx. A PRL for lxEV-DO has a different format. For both lx and lxEV-DO, the PRL information is typically stored as a file.<br>
[0031] FIG. 3 shows a file 300 containing an extended PRL, which is a PRL in the extended PRL format defined by TIA-683-C. The extended PRL contains a number of fields, all of which are shown in FIG. 3. Table 1 provides a short description for the fields in the extended PRL.<br><br>

[0032] Conventionally, the extended PRL contains extended system records, extended acquisition records, and common subnet records for lx and/or lxEV-DO systems. A wireless device that stores this extended PRL is only able to select and acquire lx and lxEV-DO systems.<br>
[0033] In an aspect, an enhanced PRL is defined that can carry extended system records, extended acquisition records, and common subnet records for WLAN and WW AN systems. In an embodiment, the enhanced PRL has the format shown in Table 1, includes all of the fields of the extended PRL, and is backward compatible with TIA-683-C. A wireless device that supports TIA-683-C (which is called a legacy wireless device) is able to extract the records for lx and lxEV-DO systems from the enhanced PRL and ignores or discards the records for WLAN systems. A new wireless device mat supports the enhanced PRL is able to extract the records for WLAN systems and uses these records for automatic selection and acquisition of the WLAN systems.<br><br>
WO 2006/138338							PCT/US2006/023096<br><br>
[0034] TIA-683-C defines two types of extended system record โ one type for lx systems and another type for lxEV-DO systems. A new type of extended system record may be defined for WLAN systems.<br>
[0035] FIG. 4A shows an extended system record 410 for WLAN. Extended system record 410 may be one of the extended system records in the extended system table within the enhanced PRL, as shown in FIG. 3. Extended system record 410 contains (1) all of the fields in the extended system record defined by TIA-683-C and (2) a new PROFILE_ID field.<br>
[0036] A WLAN extended system record contains information for an SSID that is assigned to a WLAN system, which may be a group of access points. The SSID is an ASCII string (e.g., "ABC") that may be up to 32 bytes long and is attached to all packets sent in the WLAN system to identify these packets as belonging to that system. The WLAN extended system record may contain the SSID for the WLAN system or may point to a location in the common subnet table where the SSID is stored. [<br>
0037] Table 2 lists the fields of WLAN extended system record 410. A short description of each field is given in Table 2, and a more detailed description for some pertinent fields is given below.<br>
Table 2 - Extended System Record for WLAN<br><br>
Field	Length(bits)	Description<br>
SYS_RECORD_LENGTH	5	Indicate the length of the extended system record in octets.<br>
SYS_RECORD_TYPE	4	Set to '0011' for WLAN extended system record.<br>
PREF_NEG	1	Indicate if operating on the WLAN system is permitted (T) or forbidden ('0').<br>
GEO	1	Indicate geographical area of the WLAN system.<br>
PRI	1	Indicate the preference for the WLAN system.<br>
ACQ_NDEX	9	Point to an extended acquisition record for the WLAN system.<br><br>
	Type-specific system ID record:<br>
RESERVED	3	Reserve for future use.<br>
PREFIX	1	Set to T if the record is a prefix for an SSID.<br>
SUBNET COMMON INCLUDED	6	Set to c0' if the SSID is included in the extended system record and to '1' if the SSID is stored in the common subnet table.<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br><br><br>
SSID_LENGTH	5	Indicate the length of the SSID in octets.<br>
SSID	variable	Contain the SSID for the WLAN system.<br>
SUBNET COMMON OFFSET	0 or l3	Point to the first record in the common subnet table that stores the SSID.<br><br>
ROAMI_ND	0 or 8	Indicate a roaming indication.<br>
ASSOCIATION_INC	1	Indicate whether the system record contains the next three fields.<br>
ASSOCIATION_TAG	0 or 8	Contain an association tag.<br>
PN_ASSOCIATION	0 or l	Identify systems with the same PN assignment.<br>
DATA_ASSOCIATION	0 or l	Identify systems with the same IP gateways.<br>
PROFILE_ID	8	Point to an authentication profile for the WLAN system.<br>
RESERVED	variable	Contain padding bits.<br>
[0038] The type-specific system ID record for WLAN extended system record 410<br>
includes various fields that are pertinent for WLAN. A PREFIX field is set to T if the<br>
record is serving as a prefix for an SSID. A WLAN deployment may have many<br>
systems that may be assigned similar SSIDs, e.g., "ABC1", "ABC2", "ABC3", and so<br>
on. If the PREFIX field is set to '1' and the SSID field is set to "ABC", then a wireless<br>
device can acquire any WLAN system with an SSID prefix of "ABC", e.g., "ABC1",<br>
"ABC2", or "ABC3". A SUBNET_COMMON_INCLUDED field indicates whether<br>
the SSID is stored in the WLAN extended system record or the common subnet table.<br>
If SUBNET_COMMONJNCLUDED = '0', then the SSID is stored in the SSID field,<br>
and     the     SUBNET_COMMON_OFFSET     is     omitted.	Conversely,     if<br>
SUBNET_COMMON_INCLUDED = '1', then the SSID field is omitted, and the SSID<br>
is stored in the common subnet table at the location indicated by the<br>
SUBNET_COMMON_OFFSET field. Each common subnet record can store 15 bytes<br>
(or octets). Thus, the first 15 bytes of the SSID are stored in the common subnet record<br>
indicated by the SUBNET_COMMON_OFFSET field, the next 15 bytes of the SSID (if<br>
any) are stored in the next common subnet record, and the last two bytes of the SSID (if<br>
any)     are     stored    in    the     following     common     subnet    record.	The<br>
SUBNET_COMMON_OFFSET field is zero for the first common subnet record in the common subnet table. The SSID_LENGTH field indicates the length of the SSID (in octets). The SSID_LENGTH field is set to 0 to indicate a wildcard SSID, which means that a WLAN system with any SSID may be acquired.<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
 [0039] Multiple WWAN and/or WLAN systems within a given geographic area may be associated together and assigned an association tag that is unique for that geographic area. For example, lx systems, IxEV-DO, and/or WLAN systems within the same geographic area may be associated together. A wireless device may attempt to acquire a lx system when first powered on, then identify WLAN systems associated with the acquired lx system, and then attempt to acquire an associated WLAN system. The association allows the wireless device to more quickly acquire WLAN systems based on lx systems.<br>
[0040] The PROFILE_ID field points to an authentication profile associated with the WLAN extended system record. For WLAN, the authentication profile contains security-related information as described below. For lx and IxEV-DO, the authentication profile may contain information such as the particular Network Access Identifier (NAT) and the particular Point-to-Point Protocol/Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (PPP/AAA) authentication and secrets to use as specified in simple IP or mobile IP profiles per TIA-683-C. A legacy wireless device would terminate the processing of the extended system record after the DATA_ASSOCIATION field and would skip the PROFILE_ID field. A new wireless device would continue to process the PROFILE_ID field. Alternatively, the PROFILE_ID field may be included in the type-specific system ID record. <br>
[0041] TIA-683-C defines 12 types of extended acquisition record. Two new types of extended acquisition record may be defined for WLAN - one new type for WLAN system acquisition (using channels) record and another new type for generic WLAN system acquisition record.<br>
[0042] FIG. 4B shows a WLAN system acquisition (using channels) record 420. Acquisition record 420 may be one of the extended acquisition records in the extended acquisition table within the enhanced PRL, as shown in FIG. 3. Acquisition record 420 may be used to acquire a WLAN system using specific channels. <br>
[0043] Table 3 provides a short description for the fields of acquisition record 420, which may include one or more occurrences of the CHAN field. Each CHAN field indicates a specific channel for the WLAN system. Each channel corresponds to a specific frequency within a given frequency band. For example, IEEE 802.11 defines 14 channels at 14 different frequencies for the 2.4 GHz band. The NUM_CHANS and CHAN fields are 5 bits and 11 bits, respectively, in length, which match the length of<br><br>

[0048] A WLAN authentication profile defines the encryption and/or authentication (if any) to use for a WLAN system. The WLAN authentication profile contains security-related information such as the type of encryption to use (if any), the type of authentication to use (if any), and pertinent authentication and encryption parameters. [0049] Table 7 lists an embodiment of the possible fields of a WLAN authentication profile. The PROFILE_ID field contains a profile ID value for the WLAN authentication profile. A profile ID value of 0 may be assigned to a default WLAN authentication profile that may be used for (1) WLAN systems that are not listed in the PRL and/or (2) WLANs that are listed in the PRL but without WLAN authentication profiles. A MOBILE_IP_PROFILE_ID field indicates a mobile IP profile to use with the WLAN authentication profile. The mobile IP profile stores authentication information for mobile IP. A hexadecimal value of 0xFF for the MOBILE_IP_PROFILE_ID field may indicate use of the active mobile IP profile (if present). The other fields of the WLAN authentication profile are described below.<br>

[0050] Various encryption and authentication schemes may be used for WLAN. For encryption, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) with key sizes of 40 and 104 bits, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), some other encryption, or no encryption may be used for WLAN. For authentication, WEP-based authentication, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), some other authentication, or no authentication may be used for WLAN. EAP includes a number of different implementations such as EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security) and EAP-MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5). EAP-TLS utilizes secure communication with a RADIUS authentication server. These various encryption and authentication schemes are known in the art. Authentication for WLAN in 3GPP2 is described in a document 3GPP2 X.S0028, entitled "Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) Interworking," which is publicly available.<br>
[0051] Table 8 lists an exemplary set of encryption types and an exemplary set of authentication types that may be supported for WLAN. A wireless device performs encryption in accordance with the encryption scheme (if any) indicated in the ENCRYPTION_TYPE field and further performs authentication in accordance with the authentication scheme (if any) indicated in the AUTHENTICATION_TYPE field. The use of WEP authentication implies that WEP encryption is enabled. 802.1X_TLS denotes IEEE 802.1X/EAP with TLS, 802.1X_MD5 denotes IEEE 802.1X/EAP with MD5, and WKEY denotes WLAN long term key (which is described in 3GPP2 X.S0028). Authentication "with RADIUS" means that authentication is performed via a RADIUS server. Authentication "with Certificate ID" means that authentication is performed with a cryptographic certificate obtained from a secured certificate authority.<br><br>

[0053] FIG. 6A shows a WLAN authentication profile 610 for WEP authentication (AUTHENTICATION_TYPE = 1). For authentication profile 610, the WEP_KEY_ID1 through WEP_KEY_ID4 fields contain four security keys used for WEP. The DEFAULT_WEP_KEY_ID field indicates which one of the four WEP security keys is the default key. The size of each of the four WEP key fields is 5 octets<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
for 64-bit WEP and 13 octets for 128-bit WEP. For each WEP key field, key[0] contains the least significant byte of a WEP key, and the least significant bit of key[0] contains the least significant bit of the WEP key.<br>
[0054] BIG. 6B shows a WLAN authentication profile 620 for 802.IX authentication based on MD5 with RADIUS (AUTHENTICATION_TYPE = 4). For authentication profile 620, the 802.1X_ID_LEN field indicates the size of an 802. IX ID field, which may be up to 72 bytes long. The 802.1X_ID field contains an ID used for RADIUS-based procedures, which is typically of the form user@realm. The 802.1X_PASSWORD_LEN field indicates the size of an 802.1X password field, which may be up to 31 bytes long. The 802.1X_PASSWORD field stores an MD-5 shared secret for RADIUS-based 802.1X authentication.<br>
[0055] The WLAN authentication profiles for the other authentication types may be formed based on Tables 7 and 9. For AUTHENTICATION_TYPE = 2, the 802.1X_PASSWORD field stores an 802.1X password for WPA in a home/small office environment where RADIUS is not used for authentication. This password is used to kick start a TKIP encryption program.<br>
[0056] FIGS. 5, 6A and 6B and Tables 7, 8 and 9 show a specific embodiment of a WLAN authentication profile table and different WLAN authentication profiles. In general, the profile table and profiles may include any number of fields for any type of information that may be used for encryption, authentication, and/or other purposes. For example, other types of encryption and authentication may be supported, and different fields may be formed in the profile for different parameters used by these other types of encryption and authentication.<br>
[0057] For the embodiments described above, an extended PRL contains extended system records and extended acquisition records for WW AN and WLAN systems, and a WLAN authentication profile table contains WLAN authentication profiles for the WLAN systems. The extended PRL is typically generated by a network operator to achieve the desired system usage, e.g., to direct wireless devices to systems operated by the network operator and/or to systems for which the network operator has a cross license. The WLAN authentication profile table contains security-related information used for encryption and authentication and may be stored in a file that is separate from the file for the extended PRL.<br>
[0058] An extended PRL may be associated with a specific WLAN authentication profile table.  This is because the PROFILE_ID field in the extended system records<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
within the extended PRL points to specific profile records within the WLAN authentication profile table. A network operator may generate different sets of extended PRL and WLAN authentication profile table, e.g., for different service plans. Each wireless device may then store one set of extended PRL and WLAN authentication profile table for the subscribed service plan.<br>
[0059] In the embodiments described above, the information used for WLAN system selection and acquisition is stored in a format that is backward compatible with TIA-683-C. The information used for WLAN system selection and acquisition may be more efficiently stored in a file that does not need to be backward compatible with TIA-683-C.<br>
[0060] FIG. 7 shows a network identifier (NI) table 700 that contains information for selecting and acquiring WLAN systems. Network identifier table 700 may be created by a wireless user, an administrator for a WLAN, a network operator for a WWAN, and/or some other entity. Network identifier table 700 may be customized for each, wireless device and may be modified as desired or necessary. For example, the wireless user may specify each SSID and its associated parameter and may store the SSID in the network identifier table. Table 10 provides a short description for the fields of network identifier table 700.<br>

[0061]       The first system record in the system table, system record 0, may be used to store WLAN system information entered by the user.   Whenever the user manually<br><br>
WO 2006/138338							PCT/US2006/023096<br><br><br>
enters system information, this information is initially stored in system record 0. If the<br>
user wants to permanently save the system information, then the information is stored as<br>
another system record in the system table.<br>
[0062]       The first profile in the profile table, with a Profile ID value of 0, may be used<br>
to store profile information manually entered by the user.    If the user wants to<br>
permanently save the profile information, then the information is stored as another<br>
profile in the profile table.  The PROFILE_ID field of each system record using this<br>
profile is updated accordingly.<br>
[0063]      FIG. 7 also shows a system record 710 in the system table within network<br>
identifier table 700.   Table 11 provides a short description for the fields of system<br>
record 710.<br>

[0064] The WLAN_BAND_CLASS field indicates the band class of the WLAN system and may be encoded as shown in Table 5. The WLAN_TECHNOLOGY field indicates the technology of the WLAN system and may also be encoded as shown in Table 5. Alternatively, 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g may be associated with bits 0,1 and 2, respectively, of the WLAN_TECHNOLOGY field, and each bit may be set to '1' to indicate support for that technology. For example, a hexadecimal value of 0x01 indicates support for 802.11a, a value of 0x02 indicates support for 802.11b, a value of<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br><br>
0x4 indicates support for 802.1 lg, a value of 0x06 indicates support for 802.11b and 802.11g, and a value of 0x07 indicates support for 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g. [0065] The CHANNEL field indicates the channel and may be from 1 through 14 for 802.1 lb/g. A channel of 0 may mean any channel. Each bit in the GROUP_MASK field may represent a different group. A system record may be associated with any given group by setting the bit for that group to ' 1'.<br>
[0066] For the embodiment shown in Table 11, a wireless device can obtain service from any WLAN system that matches the SSID, WLAN_MODE, and GROUP_MASK fields of a system record in the network identifier table. For this embodiment, there is no preference among WLAN systems within the same geographic area. In other embodiments, the system record may include other fields used to indicate preference. [0067] Different types of system records may be defined for different technologies (e.g., 802.11, lx, lxEV-DO, and so on) and included in network identifier table 700. Different system record types may be associated with different technology-specific fields. This allows network identifier table 700 to store system records for WLAN systems as well as other systems utilizing other technologies.<br>
[0068] FIGS. 3 through 7 and Tables 1 through 11 show specific embodiments of an extended PRL and a network identifier file that can store information used to perform system selection, acquisition, encryption, and authentication for WLAN systems. In general, the information may be stored (1) in any number of tables, any number of records, and any number of fields and (2) using any format for the tables, records, and fields. The system and acquisition information may be stored in separate system and acquisition records (as shown in FIG. 3) or in the system record (as shown in FIG. 7). The information for encryption and authentication may be stored in separate profile records (as shown in FIG. 7) or may be combined with the system records (not shown in any of the figures).<br>
[0069] FIG. 8 shows an embodiment of a process 800 performed by a wireless device for system selection and acquisition. Initially, a PRL containing information for WWAN and WLAN systems is obtained, e.g., from a non-volatile memory (block 810). The PRL is used for system selection and acquisition (block 820). For the embodiment shown in FIG. 8 for block 820, one or more acquisition records are obtained from the PRL (block 822). WWAN and/or WLAN systems are searched and acquired based on the acquisition record(s) (block 824). Acquisition may be attempted with one acquisition record at a time, and the acquisition records in the PRL may be selected in a<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
predetermined (e.g., sequential) order. A WLAN system may be acquired, e.g., based on the technology, band class, and/or channel indicated in the acquisition record. After acquiring at least one system, system records for the system(s) that have been acquired as well as WWAN and/or WLAN systems that are in the same geographic area are obtained from the PRL (block 826). A WWAN system or a WLAN system in the geographic area is selected, e.g., based on the preference for the WWAN and WLAN systems in the geographic area (block 828). This preference may be indicated by the PRI field, the PREFIX field, and/or other fields in the system records, as shown in Table 2 and FIG. 4A. If the selected system has not been acquired, then acquisition of the selected system is performed based on its acquisition record. The system selection and acquisition may be performed iteratively such that service is obtained from the most preferred system that can be acquired.<br>
[0070] In another embodiment, a lx system is initially searched and acquired based on acquisition records for lx systems in the PRL. If a lx system is acquired, then WLAN systems associated with this lx system is determined based on the system records in the PRL. Acquisition may thereafter be attempted on one or more of these WLAN systems. System selection and acquisition may also be performed in other manners.<br>
[0071] If the selected system is a WLAN system, as determined in block 830, then a profile record for the WLAN system is obtained from a WLAN authentication profile table (block 832). Encryption and/or authentication may be performed for the WLAN system as indicated by the profile record (block 834). For example, the profile record may indicate which encryption scheme (if any) to use and which authentication scheme (if any) to use and may further contain pertinent information for the encryption and/or authentication schemes. Encryption would then be performed for the WLAN system in accordance with the encryption scheme and further based on the associated information in the profile record. Similarly, authentication may be performed with the WLAN system in accordance with the authentication scheme and further based on the associated information in the profile record.<br>
[0072] System selection and acquisition for WLAN systems may also be performed based on the network identifier table shown in FIG. 7 and Table 10. System selection may be performed in a different manner with the network identifier table than with the PRL. For example, WLAN systems may be selected based on technology, band class, channel, WLAN mode, and/or other criteria when using the network identifier table.<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br>
The information in the network identifier table may be used for system selection, acquisition, encryption (if any), and authentication (if any).<br>
[0073]  FIG. 9 shows a block diagram of wireless device 120x. On the transmit path, traffic data and signaling to be sent by wireless device 120x are processed (e.g., formatted, encoded, and interleaved) by an encoder 912 and further processed (e.g., modulated, spread, channelized, and scrambled) by a modulator (MOD) 914 to obtain a stream of data chips. A transmitter unit (TMTR) 922 then conditions (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) the data chip stream to generate an uplink signal, which is transmitted via an antenna 924. On the receive path, downlink signals transmitted by base stations 110 in WWAN 100 and/or access points 112 in WLAN 102 are received by antenna 924 and provided to a receiver unit (RCVR) 926. Receiver unit 926 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and frequency downconverts) the received signal and further digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain data samples. A demodulator (DEMOD) 916 processes (e.g., descrambles, despreads, channelizes, and demodulates) the data samples to obtain symbols. A decoder 918 further processes (e.g., deinterleaves and decodes) the symbols to obtain decoded data. Encoder 912, modulator 914, demodulator 916, and decoder 918 may be implemented by a modem processor 910. These units perform processing in accordance with the technology used by the WWAN or WLAN system with which wireless device 120x communicates. [0074] A processor/controller 930 directs the operation of various units within wireless device 120x. Processor/controller 930 may implement process 800 in FIG. 8 for system selection and acquisition. A memory unit 932 stores program codes and data used by processor/controller 930 and other units. Memory unit 932 may store a PRL for WWAN and WLAN systems, a profile table for WLAN systems, and/or a network identifier (NT) table for WLAN systems and possibly other systems. The PRL, profile table, and/or NI table may be used for system selection and acquisition as described above. A removable module 934 includes a non-volatile memory unit that can store the PRL, the profile table, and/or the NI table. Removable module 934 may be a Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) (used for cdma2000), a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) (used for W-CDMA and GSM), a Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USM) (also used for W-CDMA and GSM), and so on.<br>
[0075] A PRL server 150 supports over-the-air programming of PRL using SMS messages. PRL server 150 may form a PRL with records for WWAN and WLAN systems, generates a data block for the PRL, and forwards the data block to a Short<br><br>
WO 2006/138338	 	PCT/US2006/023096<br><br>
 Message Service (SMS) service center 140. Center 140 encapsulates the data block within one or more SMS messages. MSC 130 receives the SMS messages and forwards the messages to base station 11 Ox, which transmits the messages over the air to the wireless devices within its coverage area. An Over-the-Air Service Provisioning Function (OTAF) (not shown in FIG. 9) also supports over-the-air programming of PRL. The OTAF may form a PRL with records for WWAN and WLAN systems, generate a data block for the PRL, and encapsulate the data block in one or more messages. MSC 130 receives the message(s) from the OTAF and forwards the message(s) to base station 11 Ox for transmission to the wireless devices. <br>
[0076] At wireless device 120x, processor/controller 930 may receive a decoded data block with the PRL sent by PRL center 150 or the OTAF and may store the PRL in memory unit 932 and/or removable module 934. Processor/controller 930 may also receive system and/or security-related information from a user for WLAN systems and may store the information in memory unit 932 and/or removable module 934<br>
[0077] The techniques described herein may be implemented by various means. For example, these techniques may be implemented in hardware, software, or a combination thereof. For a hardware implementation, the processing units used to perform system selection and acquisition may be implemented within one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), digital signal processors (DSPs), digital signal processing devices (DSPDs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), processors, controllers, micro-controllers, microprocessors, electronic devices, other electronic units designed to perform the functions described herein, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0078] For a software implementation, the techniques may be implemented with modules (e.g., procedures, functions, and so on) that perform the functions described herein. The software codes may be stored in a memory unit (e.g., memory unit 932 in FIG. 9) and executed by a processor (e.g., processor 930). The memory unit may be implemented within the processor or external to the processor.<br>
[0079] The previous description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention.

ABSTRACT<br>
"SYSTEM SELECTION AND ACQUISITION FOR WWAN AND<br>
WLAN SYSTEMS"<br>
A preferred roaming list (PRL) carries system and acquisition records for wireless wide area network (WWAN) systems and wireless local area network (WLAN) systems. New system and acquisition records may be defined for WLAN. The PRL and system and acquisition records may be defined to be backward compatible with TIA-683-C. System and acquisition information for WLAN systems may be stored in the new system and acquisition records, respectively. Information used to perform encryption and/or authentication for WLAN systems may be stored in a separate WLAN authentication profile table. The system record for each WLAN system indicates a acquisition record and a profile record for that WLAN system. A network identifier table may also carry system records and profile records for WLAN systems. The system records carry information used for WLAN system selection and acquisition. The profile records carry information used to perform encryption and/or authentication for WLAN systems.<br></td>
