				<td>PEPTIDE INHIBITORS FOR MEDIATING STRESS RESPONSES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peptides recognized by monoclonal anti-DNA<br>
antibodies, the peptides being capable of inhibiting cellular and immune stress<br>
responses in a eukaryotic cell, for the treatment of human degenerative disorders and<br>
inflammation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Apoptosis<br>
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is of fundamental importance to normal<br>
biological processes including embryogenesis, maintenance of tissue homeostasis,<br>
cellular development of multicellular organisms, elimination of virus-infected cells,<br>
and the development of the immune system (Ellis et al., 1991). It is a type of cell<br>
death that is fundamentally distinct from degenerative death or necrosis in that it is an<br>
active process of gene-directed cellular self-destruction which, in some instances,<br>
serves a biologically meaningful homeostatic function,<br>
£53<br>
The p53 protein, originally identified as a tumor-associated antigen, is the<br>
product of a tumor suppressor gene that functions to arrest the growth of mutated or<br>
aberrant cells (Baker et al, 1990). Functional p53 is believed to detect DNA damage<br>
(Lee et al, 1995) and subsequently induce DNA repair (Kastan et al, 1991), growth<br>
arrest (Kuerbitz et al, 1992), or apoptosis (Yonish-Rouach et al, 1991) of the aberrant<br>
cells. In particular, p53 controls genomic stability by eliminating genetically damaged<br>
cells from the cell population, and one of its major functions is to prevent tumor<br>
formation.<br>
The p53 protein has at least two DNA-binding sites:<br>
(1) the core of the p53 protein, which interacts specifically with a DNA sequence in<br>
icspuusivc genes ei-ueiry et al, iyy2); and<br>
(2) the C-terminus of the p53 protein, which can recognize features common to<br>
damaged DNA in general (Lee et al, 1995; Foord et ah 1991).<br>
The p53 protein is a transcription factor that binds specifically to a consensus<br>
site present in the regulatory sequences of p53-dependent genes (el-Deiry et al, 1992).<br>
Mutation of the p53 gene in the domain encoding sequences involved in binding to<br>
the specific DNA regulatory site causes a loss of tumor suppression. Therefore, it is<br>
not surprising that a significant proportion of natural human tumors bear mutated p53<br>
(Hollsteinetal, 1991).<br>
p53 has a short half-life, and, accordingly, is continuously synthesized and<br>
degraded in the cell. However, when a cell is subjected to stress, p53 is stabilized.<br>
Examples of cell stress that induce p53 stabilization are:<br>
a) DNA damage, such as damage caused by UV (ultraviolet) radiation, cell<br>
mutations, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy;<br>
b) hypertbermia;<br>
c) hypoxia; and<br>
d) deregulation of microtubules caused by some chemotherapeutic drugs, e.g.,<br>
treatment using taxol or Vinca alkaloids.<br>
Stress-activated p53 induces a cascade of events that result in growth arrest or<br>
apoptosis of the stressed cell, thereby preventing the outgrowth of aberrant cells and<br>
tumor formation (Ko, 1996). However, excessive activation of p53 after severe stress<br>
can be harmful to the organism, as tissue function may be damaged by excessive<br>
apoptosis (Komarova, 2001).<br>
Specifically, radiation therapy and chemotherapy exhibit severe side effects,<br>
such as severe damage to the lyrnphoid and hematopoietic system and intestinal<br>
epithelia, which limit the effectiveness of these therapies. Other side effects, like hair<br>
loss, also are p53 mediated and further detract from cancer therapies. Therefore, to<br>
eliminate or reduce adverse side effects in normal tissues associated with cancer<br>
treatment, it would be beneficial to inhibit p53 activity hi normal tissue during<br>
treatment of p53-deficient tumors, and thereby protect normal tissue.<br>
Inactivation of p53 has been considered an undesirable and unwanted event,<br>
and considerable effort has been expended to facilitate cancer treatment by restoring<br>
p53 function. However, p53 restoration or imitation causes the above-described<br>
problems with respect to damaging normal tissue cells during chemotherapy or<br>
radiation therapy. These normal cells are subjected to stress during cancer therapy,<br>
which leads the p53 in the cell to cause a programmed death. The cancer treatment<br>
then kills both the tumor cells and the normal cells.<br>
US Patent No. 6,593,353 discloses p53 inhibitors in the treatment of p53-<br>
mediated diseases, conditions and injuries.<br>
US Patent No. 6,420,136 discloses methods for modulating the activity of the<br>
p53 protein in cells by the addition of a protein which enhances or inhibits the<br>
biochemical activity of p53.<br>
US Patent No. 6,630,584 discloses a single chain antibody which recognizes<br>
an epitope exposed on mutant, but not on wild-type p53 and a DNA molecule<br>
encoding the single chain Fv, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the antibody<br>
and methods of treatment using the pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
p53 and Stress-Associated Response<br>
The adverse effects of p53 activity on an organism are not limited to cancer<br>
therapies. p53 is activated as a consequence of a variety of stresses associated with<br>
injuries (e.g., burns) naturally occurring diseases (e.g., hyperthermia associated with<br>
fever, and conditions of local hypoxia associated with a blocked blood supply, stroke,<br>
and ischemia) and cell aging (e.g., senescence of fibroblasts), as well as a cancer<br>
therapy. Temporary p53 inhibition, therefore, also can be therapeutically effective in:<br>
(a) reducing or eliminating p53-dependent neuronal death in the central nervous<br>
system, i.e., brain and spinal cord injury, (b) the preservation of tissues and organs<br>
prior to transplanting, (c) preparation of a host for a bone marrow transplant, and (d)<br>
reducing or eliminating neuronal damage during seizures, for example.<br>
In addition, various degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease,<br>
Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke (Mattson, 2001; Martin, 2001), glaucoma<br>
(Nickells, 1999) secondary degeneration after trauma (Raghupathi, 2000), myocardial<br>
infarction (Haunstetter, 1998) are associated with excessive cell death of sensitive<br>
tissue in response to stress. Therefore, temporary inhibition of stress-related cell death<br>
may serve the prevention and therapy of degenerative diseases (Komarova, 2001).<br>
Monoclonal Antibody to the DNA-binding Domain of p53<br>
Antibodies to DNA are characteristic of many autoimmune diseases, notably<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and particularly lupus nephritis. However, there<br>
is at present no generally accepted explanation for the prevalence of anti-DNA<br>
antibodies in autoimmune disorders. Immunity to DNA appears to be driven by an<br>
antigen (Radic et al, 1994), but self-DNA is unlikely to be the driving antigen because<br>
mammalian DNA usually does not induce an anti-DNA immune response (Pisetsky,<br>
1996).<br>
It has been reported that immunization with monoclonal antibodies can induce<br>
immune responses that extend beyond the specificity of the antibody, probably by<br>
anti-idiotypic connectivity based on idiotypic determinants in the variable regions of<br>
the immunizing monoclonal antibody.<br>
According to idiotypic antibody network terminology, Abl is the first<br>
antibody, the antibody binding to the antigen, and Ab2 is the anti-idiotypic antibody<br>
to Abl. The variable region of Ab2 may mimic the conformation of the antigen<br>
because both the antigen and Ab2 can be bound by Abl. Ab3 is the anti-idiotypic<br>
antibody to Ab2. Because of the chain of structural complementarity, Abl and Ab3<br>
can have similar specificity for the original antigen.<br>
The PAb-421 antibody is a prototypic monoclonal antibody that reacts with<br>
the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of p53. The sequences of the variable heavy<br>
(VH) and variable light (VL) chains of the anti-p53 PAb-421 have been elucidated (see<br>
WO 98/56416). The use of PAb-421 antibody for the treatment of cancer was<br>
suggested, since it activated DNA binding of p53 in vitro (see WO 94/12202).<br>
The inventors previously reported that immunization of mice with PAb-421<br>
induced formation of anti-idiotypic antibodies that also bind DNA (Herkel et al.,<br>
2000; and WO 00/23082). Two of these monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies,<br>
designated Idi-1 and Idi-2, mimicked the binding properties of the p53 regulatory<br>
domain and reacted specifically with PAb-421 and double- and single stranded DNA.<br>
Jt was suggested by the present inventors (after the priority date of the present<br>
invention) that damaged DNA has a chemically defined structure that is recognized by<br>
p53 and by ldi-1 and Idi-2 antibodies (Herkel, et al, 2004). Nowhere in the<br>
background art was it taught or suggested that it is possible to identify novel peptides<br>
having anti apoptctic and oui-iuflcuimialui. piujjcuics using such anu-icuotypic<br>
antibodies.<br>
There is an unmet need for novel compositions that may serve to attenuate<br>
cellular and immune stress-response in normal tissue, in a manner that is specific, safe<br>
and effective, thereby reducing the severity of stress associated degenerative diseases<br>
and stress-induced inflammation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods comprising<br>
peptides for inhibiting cellular and immune stress-response to a variety of stressassociated<br>
conditions. The peptides of the present invention exhibit anti-apoptotic and<br>
anti-inflammatory activity, thereby increasing cell survival in cells or tissues that are<br>
exposed to stress,<br>
While the use of antibodies to p53 for inducing anti-tumor immunity has been<br>
described, the present invention demonstrates that anti idiotypic antibodies<br>
immunoreactive with anti-p53 antibodies also may be used to define therapies useful<br>
to prevent or decrease cell death.<br>
Unexpectedly, it is now disclosed that peptides, recognized by monoclonal<br>
antibodies generated by idiotypic immunization to an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody<br>
are of potential use for therapy of human degenerative diseases and in modifying<br>
inflammatory responses. In other words, the anti-p53 antibodies (Abs) can generate<br>
anti-idiotypic Abs, wherein these latter Abs recognize epitopes useful for preventing<br>
cell death or inflammation.<br>
The invention is based, in part, on experiments demonstrating the efficacy of<br>
the peptides of the invention in ameliorating stress-induced cell death and p53-<br>
mediated response, induced by stimuli such as DNA-damaging agents, hyperthermia,<br>
toxic stress and y-irradiation.<br>
Surprisingly, it was further discovered that peptides of the invention exhibit<br>
anti-inflammatory activity, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the invention demonstrates<br>
that the peptides of the invention are useful for treating inflammatory and<br>
autoimmune diseases.<br>
AcnrHirio; the afirct aspeact the invention ic directed tc pcptidcc comprising ^u<br>
epitope immunoreactive with an anti-idiotypic antibody directed against an anti-p53<br>
antibody, wherein the anti-p53 antibody is immunoreactive with at least a part of the<br>

least one activity selected from anti-apoptotic activity and anti-inflammatory activity.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides compositions and methods comprising<br>
peptides for inhibiting cellular and immune stress-response to a variety of stressassociated<br>
conditions. The invention provides compositions and methods for the<br>
treatment of human degenerative diseases and inflammation, utilizing peptides<br>
recognized by monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies, the peptides having anti-apoptotic<br>
and anti-inflammatory activity.<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, the term "Linear Peptide" means a peptide or polypeptide in<br>
which the amino acids are linked to one another via an amide bond formed between<br>
the alpha-amino group of one and the alpha-carboxylic group of another.<br>
As used herein, "cell" refers to a eukaryotic cell. Typically, the cell is of<br>
animal origin and can be a stem cell or somatic cells. Suitable animal cells can be of,<br>
for example, mammalian and avian origin. Examples of mammalian cells include<br>
human, bovine, ovine, porcine, murine, rabbit cells. The cell may be an embryonic<br>
cell, bone marrow stem cell or other progenitor cell. Where the cell is a somatic cell,<br>
the cell can be, for example, an epithelial cell, fibroblast, smooth muscle cell, blood<br>
cell (including a hematopoietic cell, red blood cell, T-cell, B-cell, etc.), cardiac<br>
muscle cell, macrophage, dendritic cell, neuronal cell (e.g., a glial cell or astrocyte).<br>
In the context of this invention "modulation" means inhibition; i.e., a decrease<br>
in expression. This modulation can be measured in ways which are routine in the art,<br>
for example by Western blot or ELISA assay of protein expression, or by an<br>
immunoprecipitation assay of protein expression.<br>
The term "treating" as used herein includes prophylactic and therapeutic uses,<br>
and refers to the alleviation of symptoms of a particular disorder in a patient, the<br>
improvement of an ascertainable measurement associated with a particular disorder,<br>
or the prevention of a particular immune response (such as transplant rejection).<br>
Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, comprise two heavy chains linked together<br>
by disulfide bonds and two light chains, each light chain being linked to a respective<br>
heavy chain by disulfide bonds in a "Y" shaped configuration. Proteolytic digestion of<br>
an antibody yields Fv (Fragment variable) and Fc (fragment crystalline) domains. The<br>
antigen binding domains, Fab', include regions where the polypeptide sequence<br>
varies. The term F(ab')2 represents two Fab' arms linked together by disulfide bonds.<br>
The central axis of the antibody is termed the Fc fragment. Each heavy chain has at<br>
one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains (CH).<br>
Each light chain has a variable domain (VL) at one end and a constant domain (CL) at<br>
its other end, the light chain variable domain being aligned with the variable domain<br>
of the heavy chain and the light chain constant domain being aligned with the first<br>
constant domain of the heavy chain (CHI).<br>
The variable domains of each pair of light and heavy chains form the antigen<br>
binding site. The domains on the light and heavy chains have the same general<br>
structure and each domain comprises four framework regions, whose sequences are<br>
relatively conserved, joined by three hypervariable domains known as<br>
complementarity determining regions (CDR1-3). These domains contribute specificity<br>
and affinity of the antigen binding site.<br>
The term "antibody" as used herein refers to a polypeptide ligaiid<br>
substantially encoded by an immunoglobulin gene or immunoglobulin genes, or<br>
fragments thereof, which specifically binds and recognizes an epitope (e.g., an<br>
ontjrrwrA Ac ncoH Viteaniri t i i o ti»rm rf»fi»rc the intact mrtlfviiles sjr.h as nolvr.lnnal<br>
antibodies or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), recombinant and engineered antibodies,<br>
as well as to fragments thereof, such as Fab, F(ab')2, Fab miniantibodies (see, for<br>
example, US Patent 5,910,573, US Patent 6294353, WO 96/37621, US patent<br>
application 08/999,554), Fv, scFv (e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,946,778, 5,091,513 and<br>
5,096,815) and the like which are capable of binding the epitopic determinant.<br>
Antibodies used in the invention can be prepared using intact polypeptides or<br>
fragments containing small peptides of interest as the immunizing antigen. The<br>
polypeptide or oligopeptide used to immunize an animal can be derived from the<br>
translation of RNA or synthesized chemically and can be conjugated to a carrier<br>
protein, if desired. Commonly used carriers that are chemically coupled to peptides<br>
are exemplified by bovine serum albumin, thyroglobulin and keyhole limpet<br>
hemocyanin. The coupled peptide is then used to immunize the animal (e.g., a mouse,<br>
a rat, or a rabbit). Non-limitative methods of generating antibodies are described in<br>
the Examples hereinbelow; however, other methods well known in the art may readily<br>
be used.<br>
By the term "anti-idiotypic antibody" is intended an antibody directed against<br>
(in other words, immunoreactive with) an idiotypic determinant of another antibody.<br>
As used herein, the term "idiotypic determinant" refers to an antigenic determinant or<br>
epitope unique to the immunoglobulin product of a single clone of cells. The idi.otope<br>
is found in the variable region of the antibody. The term "epitope" refers to an<br>
antigenic determinant on a molecule which is recognized by antibodies.<br>
As used herein, the term "immunoreactive" means that the antibody is capable<br>
of binding the antigen with a binding affinity that is indicative of an immune reaction<br>
to the antigen. Such affinities are well known to those of skill in the art and include<br>
affinities of 105 to 1014 M"1. Methods of determining the affinity of an antibody<br>
composition are described in Day, Advanced Immunochemistry, (2nd edition) Wiley-<br>
Liss, New York, N.Y. (1990).<br>
Stressin peptides<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention is directed to peptides comprising an<br>
epitope immunoreactive with an anti-idiotypic antibody directed against an anti-p53<br>
antibody, wherein the anti-p53 antibody is immunoreactive with at least a part of the<br>
regulatory domain at the C-terminus of p53. The peptides of the invention exhibit at<br>
least one activity selected from anti-apoptotic activity and anti-inflammatory activity,<br>
as will be specified hereinbelow.<br>
In one embodiment, the peptides are selected by anti-idiotypic monoclonal<br>
antibodies having structural mimicry properties to the p53 regulatory domain.<br>
According to certain embodiments, the peptides are immunoreactive with monoclonal<br>
antibodies raised against anti-p53 antibodies. In one particular embodiment, the antip53<br>
antibody is PAb-421 (Herkel et al., 2000). In other particular embodiments, the<br>
peptides are immunoreactive with monoclonal antibodies designated Idi-1 and Idi-2,<br>
having structural mimicry properties to the p53 regulatory domain (Herkel et al.,<br>
2004).<br>
In other embodiments, the peptides are immunoreactive with an anti-idiotypic<br>
antibody molecule comprising VL-CDR3 and VH-CDR3 sequences selected from the<br>
group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 18, and SEQ ID NOS:21 and 24. In another<br>
embodiment, the anti-idiotypic antibody is a molecule comprising CDR sequences<br>
selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS:13-18, and SEQ ID NOS:19-24.<br>
In another embodiment, the anti-idiotypic antibody is a molecule comprising VL<br>
regions and VH regions selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:9 and 10,<br>
SEQ ID NOS: 11 and 12, analogs thereof.<br>
The peptides are characterized and synthesized by methods known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the peptides are characterized by mass spectrometry and<br>
synthesized by chemical synthesis, as described below.<br>
The peptides of the invention are preferably from 5 to 25 amino acids, more<br>
preferably from 5 to 15 amino acids and most preferably from 7 to 12 amino acids.<br>
According to certain particular embodiment, the present invention provides<br>
four selected peptides, designated Stressin-1 to 4 (for STress RESponse Specific<br>
peptide INhibitor). The amino acid sequences of certain peptides of the invention are<br>
listed in Table 1 and designated SEQ ID NO:1 through SEQ ID NO:4.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the amino acid residues described herein are<br>
preferred to be in the "L" isomeric form. However, residues in the "D" isomeric form<br>
can be substituted for any L-amino acid residue, as long as the peptide retains the<br>
desired functional property.<br>
In other particular embodiments, the invention provides analogs, fragments<br>
and functional derivatives of the peptides designated SEQ ID NO:1 through SEQ ID<br>
N0:4, as will be described in detail hereinbelow. According to certain particular<br>
embodiments, the derivatives are retro-inverso peptides having an amino acid<br>
sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS:5-8, as specified below. In a<br>
particular embodiment, the peptide has an amino acid sequence as set forth in any one<br>
of SEQ ID NOS: 1,2 and 5.<br>
Previously, mAbs Idi-1 and Idi-2 were demonstrated to specifically bind both<br>
PAb-421 and DNA, single- or double-stranded (Herkel et al., 2000 of some of the<br>
inventors of the present invention). The present, invention provides antibody<br>
molecules directed to PAb-421 comprising variable regions selected from the group<br>
consisting of SEQ ID NOS:9 and 10 and SEQ ID NOS: 11 and 12, and antibody<br>
molecules comprising CDRs having amino acid sequences selected from the group<br>
consisting of; SEQ ID NOS:13-18 and SEQ ID NOS:19-24. Such antibodies exclude<br>
the known mAbs termed Idi-1 and Idi-2.<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody molecule comprises VIGORS and VHCDR3<br>
sequences selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS: 15 and 18<br>
(corresponding to Complementarity Determining Region 3 of the light chain of Idi-1<br>
and Complementarity Determining Region 3 of the heavy chain of Idi-1, respectively)<br>
and SEQ ID NOS:21 and 24 (Idi-2). In another embodiment, the antibody molecule<br>
comprises CDR sequences as presented in Table 4 below, having amino acid<br>
sequences selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NOS:13-18 (Idi-1) and SEQ<br>
ID NOS: 19-24 (Idi-2). In another embodiment, the antibody molecule comprises VL<br>
regions and VH regions (variable regions of an immunoglobulin light and heavy<br>
chain) selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOS:9 and 10 (Idi-1), SEQ ID<br>
NOS: 11 and 12 (Idi-2). The antibody molecules of the invention also include<br>
molecules comprising analogs and derivatives of said VL, regions and VH regions, as<br>
long as the analog or derivative is immunoreactive with the antigen-binding portion of<br>
PAb-421.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides use of antibody molecules as<br>
described above for isolating peptides exhibiting at least one activity selected from the<br>
group consisting of anti-apoptotic activity and anti-inflammatory activity. Suitable<br>
methods utilizing these antibodies for identification and isolation of the peptides of<br>
the invention are disclosed hereinbelow.<br>
Phage display library<br>
Phage display peptide libraries have emerged as a powerful method in<br>
identifying such peptide agonists and antagonists. See, for example, Scott et al.<br>
(1990), Devlin et al. (1990), U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; U.S. Pat, No. 5,733,731; U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 5,498,530; U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,018; U.S. Pat, No. 5,338,665; U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,922,545; WO 96/40987; and WO 98/15833. In such libraries, random peptide<br>
sequences are displayed by fusion with coat proteins of filamentous phage. Typically,<br>
the displayed peptides are affinity-eluted against an antibody-immobilized<br>
extracellular domain of a receptor. The retained phages may be enriched by<br>
successive rounds of affinity purification and repropagation. The best binding<br>
peptides may be sequenced to identify key residues within one or more structurally<br>
related families of peptides. See, e.g., Cwirla et al. (1997), in which two distinct<br>
families were identified. The peptide sequences may also suggest which residues may<br>
be safely replaced by alanine scanning or by mutagenesis at the DNA level.<br>
Mutagenesis libraries may be created and screened to further optimize the sequence of<br>
the best binders (Lowman, 1997).<br>
The peptides of the invention were selected and isolated from a phage display<br>
library (Ph.D.-7 or Ph.D.-12 from New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) with an<br>
antibody surrogate of the p53 regulatory domain. The p53 antibody surrogate had<br>
been generated by idiotypic immunization to the PAb-421 monoclonal antibody<br>
(Herkel et al., 2000) which binds the p53 regulatory domain; two monoclonal<br>
antibodies, designated Idi-1 and Idi-2, mimicked the binding properties of the p53<br>
regulatory domain.<br>
The selected candidate peptides were tested for their ability to interfere with<br>
the p53-mediated cellular stress response by testing their capacity to inhibit the<br>
response to hyperthermia of the L12 cell line (Wolf, 1984), which lacks endogenous<br>
p53 activity and had been stably transfected with the p53 gene or a control vector. In<br>
these cells, p53 activity induces growth arrest and cell survival rather than apoptosis<br>
in response to hyperthermia (Nitta, 1997).<br>
Four peptides. designated Strressin-1 to -4 (Tor STress RFSponse Specific<br>
peptide INhibitor), were identified that at concentrations of 100 (J.g/ml inhibited p53-<br>
mediated growth arrest after hyperthermia and induced death of almost all cells with<br>
active p53, which is the response of L12 cells that lack p53 activity (Table 1); the<br>
peptide sequences are shown in Table 2.<br>
Alternative methods for identifying and isolating peptides<br>
Structural analysis of protein-protein interaction may also be used to suggest<br>
peptides that mimic the binding activity of large protein ligands. In such an analysis,<br>
the crystal structure may suggest the identity and relative orientation of critical<br>
residues of the large protein ligand, from which a peptide may be designed (see, e.g.,<br>
Takasaki et al, 1997). These analytical methods may also be used to investigate the<br>
interaction between a receptor protein and peptides selected by phage display, which<br>
may suggest further modification of the peptides to increase binding affinity.<br>
Other methods compete with phage display in peptide research. A peptide<br>
library can be fused to the carboxyl terminus of the lac represser and expressed in E.<br>
coli. Another E. coli-based method allows display on the cell's outer membrane by<br>
fusion with a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL). Hereinafter, these and<br>
related methods are collectively referred to as "E. coli display". In another method,<br>
translation of random RNA is halted prior to ribosome release, resulting in a library of<br>
polypeptides with their associated RNA still attached. Hereinafter, this and related<br>
methods are collectively referred to as "ribosome display". Other methods employ<br>
chemical linkage of peptides to RNA; see, for example, Roberts and Szostak (1997).<br>
Hereinafter, this and related methods are collectively referred to as "RNA-peptide<br>
screening". Chemically derived peptide libraries have been developed in which<br>
peptides are immobilized on stable, non-biological materials, such as polyethylene<br>
rods or solvent-permeable resins. Another chemically derived peptide library uses<br>
photolithography to scan peptides immobilized on glass slides. Hereinafter, these and<br>
related methods are collectively referred to as "chemical-peptide screening".<br>
Chemical-peptide screening may be advantageous in that it allows use of D-amino<br>
acids and other unnatural analogues, as well as non-peptide elements. Both biological<br>
and chemical methods are reviewed in Wells and Lowman (1992).<br>
Phage display, in particular, is useful in generating peptides for use in the<br>
present invention. It has been stated that affinity selection from libraries of random<br>
peptides can be used to identify peptide ligands for any site of any gene product<br>
(Dedman et al., 1993). Phage display is particularly well suited for identifying<br>
peptides that bind to such proteins of interest as cell surface receptors or any proteins<br>
having linear epitopes (Wilson et al., 1998; Kay et al., 1998).<br>
Synthesis of Peptides of the Invention<br>
The peptides of the invention can be produced by any known chemical and<br>
recombirmnt methods of producing an amino-acid sequence, including<br>
peptidomimetic methodologies (Allen G., 1989; Young, 1963; Meienhofer, 1973;<br>
Schroder and Lupke, 1965). Chemical synthesis is commonly performed by coupling<br>
of the amino acid residues or peptide fragments to one another in correct order in<br>
liquid phase to produce the desired peptide. Another common strategy is the coupling<br>
of the amino acids to one another starting with a solid phase (resin) to which the Cterminal<br>
of the last amino acid of the sequence is coupled, whereupon the C-terminal<br>
of the penultimate amino acid is coupled to the N-terminal of the last amino acid, etc.,<br>
finally releasing the built-up peptide from the solid phase (so called solid-phase<br>
technique).<br>
The term "peptide" refers to molecules of 2 to 25 amino acids, with molecules<br>
of 5 to 20 amino acids preferred and those of 7 to 12 amino acids most preferred.<br>
Exemplary peptides may be randomly generated by any of the methods cited above,<br>
carried in a peptide library (e.g., a phage display library), or derived by digestion of<br>
proteins.<br>
The present invention encompasses any analog, derivative, and conjugate<br>
containing the peptides of the invention, the amino acid sequence of which is shown<br>
herein so long as the peptide is capable of inhibiting apoptosis and/or inflammation.<br>
Thus, the present invention encompasses peptides containing non-natural amino acid<br>
derivatives or non-protein side chains.<br>
The term "analog" includes any peptide or polypeptide having an amino acid<br>
sequence substantially identical to one of the sequences specifically shown herein in<br>
which one or more residues have been conservatively substituted with a functionally<br>
similar residue and which displays the abilities as described herein. Examples of<br>
conservative substitutions include the substitution of one non-polar (hydrophobia)<br>
of one polar (hydrophilic) residue for another such as between arginine and lysine,<br>
between glutamine and asparagine, between glycine and serine, the substitution of one<br>
basic residue such as lysine, arginine or histidine for another, or the substitution of<br>
one acidic residue, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another.<br>
A peptide derivative refers to a molecule comprising the amino acid sequence<br>
of a peptide of the invention subject to various changes, including, but not limited to,<br>
chemical modifications, substitutions, insertions, extensions and deletions where such<br>
changes do not destroy the anti-inflammatory or anti-apoptotic activity of the peptide,<br>
and such derivative is not a known peptide or protein. "Peptide derivative" is intended<br>
to include peptide mimetics, as described hereinbelow. In this regard, a peptide of this<br>
invention corresponds to, and preferably is identical to, one of the peptides listed in<br>
Table 1, where one or more changes are made so long as the polypeptide retains the<br>
inhibitory function of peptide of the invention in one or more of the assays as defined<br>
herein. With respect to the antibody molecules of the invention, a variable region<br>
derivative retains the ability to specifically bind (i.e. is immunoreactive with) the<br>
idiotypic determinant of PAb-421.<br>
Peptide derivatives having chemical modifications include, for example,<br>
peptides having one or more residues chemically derivatized by reaction of side<br>
chains or functional groups. Such derivatized molecules include, for example, those<br>
molecules in which free amino groups have been derivatized to form amine<br>
hydrochlorides, p-toluene sulfonyl groups, carbobenzoxy groups, t-butyloxycarbonyl<br>
groups, chloroacetyl groups or formyl groups. Free carboxyl groups may be<br>
derivatized to form salts, methyl and ethyl esters or other types of esters or<br>
hydrazides. Free hydroxyl groups may be derivatized to form O-acyl or O-alkyl<br>
derivatives. The imidazole nitrogen of histidine may be derivatized to form N-irnbenzylhistidine.<br>
Also included as chemical derivatives are those peptides, which<br>
contain one or more naturally occurring amino acid derivatives of the twenty standard<br>
amino acid residues. For example: 4-hydroxyproline may be substituted for proline; 5-<br>
hydroxylysine may be substituted for lysine; 3-methylhistidine may be substituted for<br>
histidine; homoserine may be substituted or serine; and ornithine may be substituted<br>
for lysine.<br>
In addition, a peptide derivative can differ from the natural sequence of the<br>
peptides of the invention by chemical modifications including, but are not limited to,<br>
terminal-NH2 acylation, acetylation, or thioglycolic acid amidation, and by terminalcarboxyl-<br>
amidation, e.g., with ammonia, methylamine, and the like.<br>
Peptides of the present invention also include any peptide having one or more<br>
additions and/or deletions of residues relative to the sequence of the peptides of the<br>
invention, the sequence of which are shown herein, so long as the requisite inhibitory<br>
activity on apoptosis and/or inflammation is maintained. The term "active fragment"<br>
thus relates to a peptide portion of a full length Stressin peptide of the invention that<br>
has at least one activity that is characteristic of the corresponding full-length peptide.<br>
Non-limitative examples of suitable methods for measuring inhibition of apoptosis<br>
and inflammation are demonstrated herein.<br>
Addition of amino acid residues may be performed at either terminus of the<br>
peptides of the invention for the purpose of providing a "linker" by which the peptides<br>
of this invention can be conveniently bound to a carrier. Such linkers are usually of at<br>
least one amino acid residue and can be of 40 or more residues, more often of 1 to 10<br>
residues. Typical amino acid residues used for linking are tyrosine, cysteine, lysine,<br>
glutamic and aspartic acid, or the like.<br>
A peptide of the invention may also be conjugated to itself or aggregated in<br>
such a way as to produce a large complex containing the peptide. Such large complex<br>
may be advantageous because it has new biological properties such as longer half-life<br>
in circulation or greater activity.<br>
Peptide Mimetic<br>
Peptidomimetics are small molecules that can bind to proteins by mimicking<br>
certain structural aspects of peptides and proteins. They are used extensively in<br>
science and medicine as agonists and antagonists of protein and peptide ligands of<br>
cellular and other receptors, and as substrates and substrate analogs for enzymes.<br>
A primary goal in the design of peptide mimetics has been to reduce the<br>
susceptibility of mimics to cleavage and inactivation by peptidases. In one approach,<br>
one or more amide bonds have been replaced in an essentially isosteric manner by a<br>
variety of chemical functional groups, including, but not limited to urea bond,<br>
carbamate bond, sulfonamide bond, hydrazine bond, or any other covalent bond. In<br>
another approach, a variety of uncoded or modified amino acids such as D-amino<br>
To test whether Stressin peptide may protect an organism from death by<br>
excessive p53 activation and tissue failure by subjecting BALB/c mice to whole body<br>
y-irradiation (6.5 Gy). A retro-inverso peptide was used to determine whether<br>
prolonged in vivo half-life would give an advantage (see Example 6); retro-inverso<br>
peptides are resistant to proteases and consist of D-amino acids in reversed order,<br>
resulting in an altered peptide backbone but unchanged orientation of the side chains<br>
(Van Regenmortel, 1998).<br>
As used herein, the term "retro-inverso peptide" of the Stressin-1 peptide, for<br>
example, as used in a variation of the invention, is intended to encompass peptides in<br>
which the sequence of the amino acids is reversed as compared to the sequence in<br>
Stressin-1 and consist of D-arnino acids in reversed order.<br>
The present invention thus provides retro-inverso Stressin peptides having an<br>
amino acid sequence as set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOS:5-8.<br>
The backbone can comprise a variety of atom types, including carbon,<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus, with the majority of the backbone chain<br>
atoms typically consisting of carbon. A plurality of side chain moieties that include a<br>
terminal guanidino or amidino group are attached to the backbone. Although spacing<br>
between adjacent sidechain moieties is typically consistent, the delivery-enhancing<br>
transporters used in the invention can also include variable spacing between sidechain<br>
moieties along the backbone.<br>
Cell Death and p53 inhibition<br>
Apoptosis, or "programmed cell death", is a process whereby the cell executes<br>
a "cell suicide" program. It is now thought that the apoptosis program is<br>
evolutionarily conserved among virtually all multicellular organisms, as well as<br>
among all the cells.in a particular organism. Further, it is believed that in many cases,<br>
apoptosis may be a "default" program that must be actively inhibited in healthy<br>
surviving cells.<br>
The decision by a cell to submit to apoptosis may be influenced by a variety of<br>
regulatory stimuli and environmental factors (Thompson, 1995). Physiological<br>
activators of apoptosis include tumor necrosis factor (TNF), Fas ligand, transforming<br>
growth factor-p, the neurotransmitters glutamate, dopamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate,<br>
withdrawal of growth factors, loss of matrix attachment, calcium and glucocorticoids.<br>
Damage-related inducers of apoptosis include heat shock, viral infection, bacterial<br>
toxins, the oncogenes myc, rel and E1A, tumor suppressor p53, cytolytic T-cells,<br>
oxidants, free radicals and nutrient deprivation (antimetabolites). Therapy-associated<br>
apoptosis inducers include gamma radiation, UV radiation and a variety of<br>
chemotherapeutic drugs, including cisplatin, doxorubicin, bleomycin, cytosine<br>
arabinoside, nitrogen mustard, methotrexate and vincristine. Toxin-related inducers or<br>
apoptosis include ethanol and d-amyloid peptide. Apoptosis can have particularly<br>
devastating consequences when it occurs pathologically in cells that do not normally<br>
regenerate, such as neurons. Because such cells are not replaced when they die, their<br>
loss can lead to debilitating and sometimes fatal dysfunction of the affected organ.<br>
Such dysfunction is evidenced in a number of neurodegenerative disorders that have<br>
been associated with increased apoptosis, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's<br>
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa and cerebellar<br>
degeneration.<br>
In one aspect, this invention provides compositions and methods for<br>
preventing or inhibiting apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. Irrespective of the mechanism<br>
by which the peptides of the invention mediates stress responses, and without wishing<br>
to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, it is postulated that the peptides<br>
may be capable of binding p53 therefore preventing p53 to be bound to damaged-<br>
DNA.<br>
A potential therapeutic inhibitor of p53 is a compound that acts at any stage of<br>
the p53 signaling pathway, and leads to functional inactivation of a p53-mediated<br>
response (i.e., blocking of p53-dependent growth arrest, apoptosis, or both). Prior<br>
investigators did not consider therapeutic p53 inhibitors because therapeutic p53<br>
suppression was considered a disadvantage leading to the onset and proliferation of<br>
cancerous tumors. The present invention, therefore, is directed to the therapeutic and<br>
reversible inhibition of p53 activity, and to peptides capable of such inhibition.<br>
However, there are several objectives that should be mentioned before a<br>
therapy involving suppression of p53 or any other protein that plays a role in<br>
apoptosis or inflammation-related disorders is implemented, for example:<br>
a) providing an inhibitor that is sufficiently efficacious in vivo for practical<br>
administration as a therapeutic dnip:<br>
b) providing an inhibitor that has a sufficiently low toxicity for use in therapy,<br>
and also does not cause undesirable side effects at concentrations sufficient to<br>
inhibit p53 activity;<br>
c) exhibiting inhibition that is reversible. Long-term p53 inactivation, for<br>
example, can significantly increase the risk of cancer;<br>
d) during temporary p53 inactivation, the cells should recover from the applied<br>
stress and the p53-activating signal should be eliminated or reduced, otherwise<br>
restoration of p53 activity while the p53-activating signal is active could result<br>
in cell damage;<br>
e) the p53 suppression therapy is not associated with a dramatic increase in the<br>
frequency of cancer development.<br>
The peptides of the invention can be used alone, or, for example, in<br>
conjunction with chemotherapy or radiation therapy during cancer treatment, to<br>
protect normal cells from p53 programmed death due to stresses inflicted by a cancer<br>
treatment or by a disease or trauma. In addition, during chemotherapy, both tumor and<br>
normal cells are destroyed. Tumor cells are preferentially killed compared to normal<br>
cells, which is the basis of a successful chemotherapy. By administering a therapeutic<br>
p53 inhibitor, for example, normal cells are protected, and the dose of the<br>
chemotherapeutic agent, therefore, can be increased to more effectively treat the<br>
cancer.<br>
It should be understood that the peptides of the present invention do not<br>
necessarily act via modulating p53 activity as some of these peptides exhibited antiapoptotic<br>
activity in p53-deficient cell lines and in p53 activity assays.<br>
Methods to measure apoptosis<br>
Apoptosis is an active, gene-directed self-destruction process of the cell and is<br>
associated with characteristic morphological and biochemical changes. Nuclear and<br>
cytoplasmic condensation and fragmentation of the dying cell into membrane-bound<br>
apoptotic bodies are typical characteristics of apoptosis. Another feature of apoptotic<br>
cell death is the chromosomal DNA degradation into oligonucleosomal fragments<br>
after the activation of specific nucleases.<br>
By "inhibiting apoptosis" or "inhibits apoptotic activity" is meant any<br>
decrease in the number of cells that undergo apoptosis relative to an untreated control<br>
(i.e. cells not exposed to the peptides of the invention). Preferably, the decrease is at<br>
least 25%, more preferably the decrease is at least 50%, and most preferably the<br>
decrease is at least one-fold.<br>
Flow cytometry offers a wide variety of possibilities to measure apoptosis.<br>
Different methods have been established and implemented, some which stain on the<br>
cell surface and some which stain intracellularly.<br>
One of the first approaches was, beside the observation that apoptotic cells<br>
shrink and have higher intracellular granularity, to stain with DNA specific<br>
fluorochromes (e.g. propidium iodide [PI], ethidium bromide [EtBr]). As soon as a<br>
lethal hit is being induced, the DNA starts to change its profile. Apoptotic DNA not<br>
only consists of fragmented DNA (visualized as shorter bands, so called DNA ladder,<br>
in an agarose gel) but is also partially digested into single nucleotides, so that<br>
fluorochromes, like PI or EtBr, have less DNA to stain (Nicoletti et al., 1991). This is<br>
typically observed by a shift to the left, called sub-Gl peak, on the specific<br>
fluorochrome detection channel in the FACScan™ (from Becton Dickinson, USA).<br>
Another method is the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated<br>
endlabeling of the DNA strand breaks (TUNEL). The TUNEL method detects DNA<br>
strand breaks in cells undergoing apoptosis. TdT is an enzyme which catalyzes the<br>
addition of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate to the 3'-OH ends of double or singlestranded<br>
DNA. Unlike normal cells, apoptotic cell nuclei incorporate exogenous<br>
nucleotides (dUTP)-DIG in the presence of TdT. An anti-DIG antibody fragment with<br>
a conjugated fluorochrome enables the visualization of apoptotic cells. An increase of<br>
apoptotic cells causes a higher number of DNA fragments and consequently a brighter<br>
fluorescence. An advantage of this method is the very high specificity (Gavrieli et al,,<br>
1992). A disadvantage of this method is that it is expensive and can only be used for a<br>
small set of samples, because it is time intensive. Therefore, it is not applicable for<br>
large screening programs.<br>
The loss of cell membrane polarity and the presentation of increased amounts<br>
of phosphatidyl serine (PS) on the outside of the cell membrane during the early phase<br>
of apoptosis has led to yet a new approach. Annexin V is a calcium-dependent<br>
phospholipid binding protein with high affinity for PS. The cell membrane integrity is<br>
maintained in the early and intermediate phases of apoptosis. Early and intermediate<br>
apoptotic cells show increased binding of Annexin-FITC and are mainly negative for<br>
Pi-staining. Late apoptotic stages and necrotic cells become double positive, because<br>
of PS presentation on the surface and the PI staining of intracellular nucleic acids due<br>
to disintegration of the membrane. This method is also costly and labor intensive.<br>
Other methods for measuring apoptosis in vivo and in vitro are disclosed in US<br>
PatNos. 6,726,895 and 6,723,567.<br>
Inflammatory stress responses and TNF-a and IL-6 mediated Inflammation<br>
The mammalian response to stress includes not only the response of the<br>
stressed cell, but also the complex activity of the immune system known as<br>
inflammation (Nathan et al., 2002), which includes a large number of immune<br>
activities that serve tissue maintenance and healing (Cohen, 2000).<br>
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are important biological<br>
entities collectively referred to as pro-inflammatory cytokines. These, along with<br>
several other related molecules, mediate the inflammatory response associated with<br>
the immunological recognition of infectious agents. The inflammatory response plays<br>
an important role in limiting and controlling pathogenic infections.<br>
Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are also associated with a<br>
number of diseases of autoimmunity such as toxic shock syndrome, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (Dinarello, et al.,<br>
1984). In these diseases, chronic elevation of inflammation exacerbates or causes<br>
much of the pathophysiology observed.<br>
An important and accepted therapeutic approach for potential drug<br>
intervention in these diseases is the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as<br>
TNF (also referred to in its secreted cell-free form as TNF-a) and IL-6. A number of<br>
anti-cytokine therapies are currently in clinical trials. Efficacy has been demonstrated<br>
with a monoclonal antibody directed against TNF-a in a number of autoimmune<br>
diseases (Heath, 1997). These include the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's<br>
disease and ulcerative colitis (Rankin, 1997, and Stack et al., 1997). The monoclonal<br>
antibody is thought to function by binding to both soluble TNF-a and to membrane<br>
bound TNF.<br>
Traumatic brain injury triggers a cascade of events resulting in delayed edema,<br>
necrosis and impaired function. Harmful mediators are accumulating in the brain after<br>
injury and recently, the role of cytokines in the pathophysiology of brain injury has<br>
been suggested. Spatial and temporal induction of TNF-ot and IL-6 activity in rat brain<br>
after closed head injury has been previously reported. An inhibitor of TNF-ci<br>
production, HU-211, was shown to improve the outcome of closed brain injury in an<br>
experimental model (Shohami, et al., 1997). Atherosclerosis is known to have an<br>
inflammatory component and cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF have been suggested to<br>
promote the disease.<br>
The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated with the acute phase<br>
response. IL-6 is a growth factor in a number in oncological diseases including<br>
multiple myeloma and related plasma cell dyscrasias (Treon, et al., 1998,). It has also<br>
been shown to be an important mediator of inflammation within the central nervous<br>
system. Elevated levels of IL-6 are found in several neurological disorders including<br>
AIDS dementia complex, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, CNS trauma and viral and bacterial meningitis (Gruol et al., 1997). IL-<br>
6 also plays a significant role in osteoporosis. In murine models it has been shown to<br>
effect bone resorption and to induce osteoclast activity (Ershler et al., 1997).<br>
WO 01/01986 discloses particular compounds alleged to having the ability to<br>
inhibit TNF-a. WO 98/52558 discloses heteroaryl urea compounds which are<br>
indicated to be useful in treating cytokine mediated diseases. WO 99/23091 discloses<br>
another class of urea compounds which are useful as anti-inflammatory agents. WO<br>
99/32463 relates to aryl ureas and their use in treating cytokine diseases and<br>
proteolytic enzyme mediated disease.<br>
The present invention shows that Stressiri peptides are useful in interfering and<br>
blocking both TNF-a and IL-6 secretion by macrophage cells in response to innate<br>
activators such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG oligonucleotides (see Example<br>
7), Therefore, these peptides are able to modify the pro-inflammatory signaling<br>
pathway in immune cells. As is demonstrated for Stressin-1 below, the peptides of the<br>
invention play a role in down-regulating the inflammatory immune response to stress.<br>
The present invention further demonstrates the anti-inflammatory properties of<br>
Stressin peptides on autoimmune inflammatory diseases, as exemplified on<br>
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of human<br>
multiple sclerosis (see Example 8).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic use<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the invention and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
As used herein a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation of one<br>
or more of the agents described herein, or physiologically acceptable salts or solvents<br>
thereof, with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and<br>
excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration<br>
of a compound to an organism.<br>
The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions, which contain peptides or<br>
polypeptides as active ingredients is well known in the art. Typically, such<br>
compositions are prepared as indictable, either as liquid solutions or suspensions,<br>
however, solid forms, which can be suspended or solubilized prior to injection, can<br>
also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. The active therapeutic<br>
ingredient is mixed with inorganic and/or organic carriers, which are pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Carriers are pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipients (vehicles) comprising more or less inert substances when added<br>
to a pharmaceutical composition to confer suitable consistency or form to the<br>
composition. Suitable carriers are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol,<br>
ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition<br>
can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying<br>
agents and pH buffering agents, which enhance the effectiveness of the active<br>
ingredient.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the peptides described herein can be<br>
determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental<br>
animals, e. g., by determining the ICso (the concentration which provides 50%<br>
inhibition) and the LDso (lethal dose causing death in 50 % of the tested animals) for a<br>
studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage<br>
may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration<br>
utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by<br>
the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl et al.,<br>
1975).<br>
The amount of active agent used in an administration composition of the<br>
present invention is an amount effective to accomplish the purpose of the particular<br>
active agent for the target indication. The amount of active agent in the compositions<br>
typically is a pharmacologically, biologically, therapeutically, or chemically effective<br>
amount. However, the amount can be less than that amount when the composition is<br>
used in a dosage unit form because the dosage unit form may contain a plurality of<br>
compounds or active agents in a single composition or may contain a divided<br>
pharmacologically, biologically, therapeutically, or chemically effective amount. The<br>
total effective amount can then be administered in cumulative units containing, in<br>
total, an effective amount, of the active agent.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the invention is an amount<br>
that when administered to a patient is capable of exerting an anti-apoptotic activity<br>
and/or an anti-inflammatory activity. Assays for detecting the anti-apoptotic activity<br>
of the peptide of the invention include, but are not limited to, staining DNA with<br>
specific fiuorochromes such as propidium iodide and ethidium bromide, Annexin V<br>
assays, TUNEL assays and the like; certain non-limitative examples of such assays<br>
are presented in the Examples below. Assays for detecting anti-inflammatory activity<br>
of the peptides are also well known in the art; non-limitative examples of such<br>
methods are presented in the Examples below.<br>
Although an appropriate dosage of a peptide of the invention varies depending<br>
on the administration route, age, body weight sex or conditions of the patient, and<br>
should be determined by the physician in the end, the dose suitable for adult humans<br>
can generally be between about 0.2-2000 mg/kg body weight, preferably between<br>
about 2-200 mg/kg.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprises one or<br>
more compounds of the present invention, and one or more excipients or diluents. In<br>
one embodiment, one or more of the compounds, or solvntes or salts of<br>
compounds.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" as used herein, refers to salts<br>
which are substantially non-toxic to living organisms. Typical pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compounds of the<br>
present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable mineral or organic acid. Such<br>
salts are also known as acid addition salts.<br>
The compositions comprising the compounds and active agents have utility in<br>
the delivery of active agents to selected biological systems and in an increased or<br>
improved bioavailability of the active agent compared to administration of the active<br>
agent without the delivery agent. Delivery can be improved by delivering more active<br>
agent over a period of time, or in delivering active agent in a particular time period<br>
(such as to effect quicker or delayed delivery) or over a period of time (such as<br>
sustained delivery).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention<br>
thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically<br>
acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing<br>
of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.<br>
Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered locally or systemically<br>
by any conventional and appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral,<br>
intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal,<br>
intrathecal, topical, rectal, buccal, inhalational or intranasal.<br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous<br>
solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution,<br>
Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration,<br>
penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such<br>
penetrants for example DMSO, or polyethylene glycol are generally known in the art.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions, which can be used orally, include push-fit<br>
capsules made of gelatin as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a<br>
plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules may contain the active<br>
ingreaned ntc in adreswggy withcr rach as lactose binders each as started,<br>
lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers.<br>
In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in<br>
suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In<br>
addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be<br>
in dosages suitable for the chosen route of administration.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention can be incorporated into<br>
oral liquid preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions,<br>
syrups, or elixirs, for example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds<br>
can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle<br>
before use. Such liquid preparations can contain conventional additives, like<br>
suspending agents, such as sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup,<br>
gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel, and<br>
hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or<br>
acacia; nonaqueous vehicles (which can include edible oils), such as almond oil,<br>
fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol, and ethyl alcohol; and<br>
preservatives, such as methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate and sorbic acid.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the peptides for use according to the present<br>
invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from<br>
a pressurized pack or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e. g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichloro-tetrafluoroethane or<br>
carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be<br>
determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges<br>
of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a<br>
powder mix of the peptide and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are also useful for topical<br>
and intralesional application. As used herein, the term "topical" means "pertaining to<br>
a particular surface area", e.g. skin and mucosa, and the topical agent applied to a<br>
certain area of said surface will affect only the area to which it is applied. The<br>
formulations of the peptides/peptide analogs may be administered topically as a gel,<br>
ointment, cream, emulsion, sustained release formulation including a transdermal<br>
patch, and may comprise liposomes and any other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier<br>
suitable for administration of the drug topically. The pharmaceutical compositions<br>
herein described may also comprise suitable solid of gel phase carriers or excipients.<br>
Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin<br>
and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a method for modulating cellular and<br>
immune stress-associated responses in a cell of an organism comprising exposing the<br>
cell to an effective amount of a peptide of the invention.<br>
In other aspects, the present invention relates to methods of treating or<br>
preventing the symptoms of inflammatory conditions and/or degenerative diseases<br>
and disorders, comprising administering to a patient suffering from the disease a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a peptide of the invention. Yet another aspect of<br>
the present invention is to provide a method of reducing or eliminating death of<br>
normal cells attributable to trauma or a disease comprising administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a peptide according to the invention to an<br>
organism to inhibit stress-related protein activity.<br>
I.o certain embodiments, the peptide is in the form of a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an effective amount of said peptide and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Stress associated responses are associated with diseases and disorders<br>
including, for example, pathological conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases<br>
(e.g. stroke, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease), myocardial infarction, exposure to<br>
radiation or chemotherapeutic agents, inflammation, injuries (e.g., burns and central<br>
nervous system injuries), cell aging, hyperthermia, seizures, hypoxias (e.g., ischemia<br>
and stroke), and in transplant tissues and organs prior to transplanting.<br>
These conditions also include autoimmune diseases, characterized by a state of<br>
immunization of an individual against at least one of the body's normal constituents.<br>
These phenomena are observed in particular in pathologies including, but not limited<br>
to infections associated with SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus disease),<br>
Gougerot-Sjogren syndrome (or Sjogren's disease) and rheumatoid polyarthritis, as<br>
well as pathologies such as sarcoidosis and osteopenia, spondylarthritis, scleroderma,<br>
multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, Addison's disease,<br>
disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic purpural hemorrhage, insulin-dependent<br>
diabetes, myasthenia, pemphigus vulgaris, pernicious anemia, poststreptococcal<br>
glomerulonephritis, psoriasis and spontaneous sterility, as well as immediate or<br>
delayed phenomena observed during graft rejections and graft-versus host disease. In<br>
one particular embodiment, the peptides of the invention are useful for the treatment<br>
of multiple sclerosis, as exemplified in Example 8 herein.<br>
The phenomenon of graft rejection is a state of immunization of an individual<br>
against foreign constituents (bodily fluids such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.,<br>
cells, tissues, organs, antibodies, etc.) deliberately implanted into the patient.<br>
As used herein, the terms "degenerative disorder" "degenerative disease" and<br>
"degenerative condition" are directed to any disorder, disease or condition<br>
characterized by inappropriate cell proliferation or inappropriate cell death or in some<br>
cases, both, or aberrant or disregulated apoptosis. These conditions also include<br>
conditions in which, although appropriate and regulated at the level of a single cell,<br>
excessive apoptosis is associated with organ dysfunction or failure.<br>
In one embodiment, the peptides are useful to prevent cell death in nonmalignant<br>
tissue or cells in a subject having a neoplastic disorder and undergoing<br>
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for the treatment of cancer.<br>
The terms "inflammatory disease" and "inflammatory condition", as used<br>
herein, mean any disease or condition in which an excessive or unregulated<br>
inflammatory response leads to excessive inflammatory symptoms, host tissue<br>
damage, or loss of tissue function.<br>
In one embodiment, the inflammatory disease or condition is an autoimmune<br>
disease. In a particular embodiment, the autoimmune disease is multiple sclerosis.<br>
In another embodiment, the inflammatory disease or condition has an etiology<br>
associated with production of at least one pro-inflammatory cytokine selected from<br>
IL-6 and TNF-a, as discussed herein.<br>
The following examples are to be considered merely as illustrative and nonlimiting<br>
in nature. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art to which the present<br>
invention pertains that many modifications, permutations, and variations may be made<br>
without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1: Peptide selection from phage display libraries:<br>
The monoclonal anti-PAb-421 antibodies Idi-1 and Idi-2 were generated and<br>
characterized as described (Herkel et al., 2004). Briefly, BALB/c mice were<br>
immunized three times with PAb-421 and the spleen cells of the mouse that produced<br>
the highest anti-PAb-421 titers were fused with NSO myeloma cells. Supernatants of<br>
the growing cells were screened by ELISA for binding to PAb-421 and to DNA. The<br>
hybridomas Idi-1 and Idi-2 were isolated and cloned twice by limiting dilution.<br>
Ph.D.-? or Ph.D.- 12 libraries from New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany<br>
were screened according to manufacturers instructions. Briefly, three rounds of<br>
selection by Idi-1 or Idi-2 monoclonal antibodies were performed and consensus<br>
peptide sequences were identified by sequencing of phage DNA. Candidate peptides<br>
were then synthesized by Sigma-Genosis (Pampisford, UK) and further studied in<br>
functional assays, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Example 2: Examining the effect of candidate peptides on p53-mediated<br>
growth arrest.<br>
The selected candidate peptides were tested for their ability to interfere with<br>
the p5 3 -mediated cellular stress response by testing their capacity to inhibit the<br>
response to hyperthermia of the L12 cell line (Wolf, 1984), which lacks endogenous<br>
p53 activity and had been stably transfected with the p53 gene or a control vector. In<br>
these cells, p53 activity induces growth arrest and cell survival rather than apoptosis<br>
in response to hyperthermia (Nitta, 1997).<br>
The amount of cell death was assessed by staining the cells with the vital dye<br>
trypan blue (Sigma) and counting the ratio of dead/live cells per visual field with a<br>
light microscope.<br>
Results: incubation for 2 hours at 42°C induced death of all cells that lacked<br>
p53 and, in contrast, transient growth arrest and survival of about 80% of the cells<br>
Specific peptide INhibitor), were identified that at concentrations of 100 fig/ml<br>
inhibited p53-mediated growth arrest after hyperthermia and. induced death of almost<br>
all cells with active p53, which is the response of LI2 cells that lack p53 activity<br>
(Table 1); the peptide sequences are shown in Table 2.<br>
Table 1: Incidence of cell death induced by hyperthermia in LI 2 cells with or<br>
without active p53 and inhibition of the p53-dependent stress response by Stressin<br>
peptides.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3: Effect of Stressin peptides on p53-mediated cell death induced by<br>
DNA damage.<br>
L12 cells were treated for 48 hours with 50uM of the DNA-damaging agent<br>
Cisplatin and p53-mediated cell death v/as determined by measuring the DNA content<br>
of cells stained with propidium iodide (Figure 1). Cells incubated in the absence of<br>
peptide responded to Cisplatin treatment with p53-mediated cell death.<br>
Results: FACS analysis shows that treatment with Stressin-1 or Stressin-2<br>
rescued 35% or 25% of the cells, respectively, from p53-mediated cell death.<br>
Example 4: Effect of Stressin peptides on p53-mediated cell death in nontransformed<br>
cells.<br>
Mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) were treated with cisplatin (80uM) in the<br>
presence or absence of Stressin-1 peptide as described in Example 3, and cell death<br>
was assessed by incorporation of the vital dye Neutral red (Sigma, Taufkirchen,<br>
Germany), O.D. at 540nm was read in an ELISA reader.<br>
The percent of viable cells is presented in Figure 2A; viability was calculated<br>
by the equation:<br>
Cell viability = sample ODs4o x 100 / OD^o of untreated cells.<br>
Micrographs of the treated cells are presented in Figure 2B.<br>
Figure 2 shows that Stressin-1 inhibited cell death of MEF cells induced by 80<br>
(aM Cisplatin in a dose-dependent way with maximal efficiency at a concentration of<br>
50 jiM.<br>
Example 5: Effect of Stressin peptides on cell death induced by toxic stress.<br>
To leam whether Stressin peptide may protect from toxic stress, primary<br>
hepatocyte cultures were incubated with or without ethanol at a concentration of<br>
0.6%, arid with 50uM Stressin-1 or without peptide. After 48 hours, the numbers of<br>
dead and alive cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion (Table 3).<br>
Results: All hepatocytes exposed to ethanol died in the absence of Stressin-1;<br>
in contrast, Stressin-1 rescued 20% hepatocytes from ethanol-induced cell death.<br>

Example 6: Effect of Stressin peptides on mice subjected to y-irradiation<br>
BALB/c mice were subjected to whole body y-irradiation (6.5 Gy). One hour<br>
after irradiation, the mice received intraperitoneally either Stressin-1 (n = 7; SEQ ID<br>
NO: 1) or a modified, retro-inverso Stressin-1 peptide (n = 7; SEQ ID NO:5), both at a<br>
concentration of SOOug/mouse, or a sham injection with saline (n = 6). The retroinverso<br>
peptide was used to determine whether prolonged in vivo-half-life would give<br>
an advantage.<br>
Results: After 17 days, 66% of the sham-treated group were dead; in contrast,<br>
none of the mice treated with the Stressin-1 peptide and only 29% of the mice treated<br>
with the modified Stressin-1 peptide were dead. After 40 days only 33% in the sham<br>
group recovered from radiation disease; in contrast, 57% and 86% of the mice treated<br>
with the modified or the unmodified Stressin-1 peptide recovered from radiation<br>
disease (Figure 3).<br>
Example 7: Effect of Stressin peptides on LPS- and CpG-induced cytokine<br>
secretion.<br>
To learn whether Stressin peptides may modify the inflammatory response to<br>
stress signals, the response of RAW 264.7 macrophage line cells to pro-inflammatory<br>
microbial signals, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CpG oligonucleotides, was studied.<br>
The cells were incubated with LPS or CpG oligonucleotides in the presence or<br>
absence of Stressin-1 (50uM). After 6 hours, the amounts of secreted TNF-a (Figure<br>
4) or Interleukin-6 (Figure 5) in culture supernatant, as a measure for macrophage<br>
activation, were determined by specific ELISA reagents and anti-TNF-a and anti-IL-6<br>
antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany).<br>
Results: Stressin-1 inhibited macrophage activation and secretion of TNF-a<br>
and Interleukin-6 induced by both LPS and CpG oligonucleotides.<br>
Example 8: Stressin-1 protects mice from experimental autoimmune disease<br>
(EAE).<br>
MBP Acl-9-specific T cell receptor-transgenic Tg4 mice (Liu et al., 1995)<br>
were immunized subcutaneously with 200ug of modified (Y at position 4) Ac 1-9<br>
peptide in complete Freund's Adjuvant followed by intraperitoneal administration of<br>
200ng of Pertussis toxin the next day. At one hour after MBP immunization one<br>
group of mice (n=4) received 100(^.1 of PBS intraperitoneally and another group of<br>
mice (n=6) received 500ug Stressin-1 peptide in lOOul PBS intraperitoneally. The<br>
mice were then tested for the development of experimental autoimmune<br>
encephalomyelitis by assessment of the clinical EAE score. As can be seen in Figure<br>
6, Stressin-1 protects mice from EAE.<br>
Example 9: Sequencing of Idi-1 and Idi-2 variable regions.<br>
Total RNA was extracted from Idi-1 and Idi-2 hybridomas using TriReagent<br>
(Molecular Research Center, INC.), and the RNA was used as a template for cDNA<br>
synthesis using Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).<br>
PCR amplification of the heavy and light chain variable regions were performed using<br>
primers specific for the respective flanking constant region: 5'<br>
CGGGAATTCCCCAGGTGCAGCTGCAGCAGTCTGG SEQ ID NO:25 and 3'<br>
GCGGGCCCTCGAGTCTATGTACATATGCAAGGCTTACAACC SEQ ID NO:26<br>
for the heavy chain; 5' CGCGCAAGCTTGATATTGTGATAACCCAGGATGA<br>
SEQ ID NO:27 and 3' GATGGTGGGAAGATG SEQ ID NO:28 for the light chain.<br>
PCR products were purified and sequenced using the same primers.<br>
The variable regions of Idi-1 (Idi-1 VL - SEQ ID NO:9; Idi-1 VH - SEQ ID<br>
NO: 10), Idi-2 (Idi-2 VL - SEQ ID NO: 11; Idi-2 VH - SEQ ID NO: 12) and PAb-421<br>
are presented in Figure 7. The CDR sequences of Idi-1 and Idi-2 are indicated in<br>
Figure 7and listed, along with their corresponding SEQ ID NOS, in Table 4 below:<br>

While the present invention has been particularly described, persons skilled in<br>
the art will appreciate that many variations and modifications can be made. Therefore,<br>
the invention is not to be construed as restricted to the particularly described<br>
embodiments, rather the scope, spirit and concept of the invention will be more<br>
readily understood by reference to the claims which follow.<br>
