CONTROLLING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
(1 ] The present invention relates to a digital broadcasting system, and more particularly,<br>
to a digital broadcast receiving system and a method for controlling the same.<br>
Backjfroiind Art<br>
[2] A digital broadcasting system is configured of a digital broadcast transmitting system<br>
(or transmitter) and a digital broadcast receiving system (or receiver). Also, the digital<br>
broadcast transmitting system digitally prcxjesses data, such as broadcast programs, and<br>
transmits the proccs.scd data to the digital broadcast receiving systein. Due to its<br>
various advantages, such as efficient data transmission, the digital broadcasting system<br>
is gradually replacing the conventional analog broadca.sting systems.<br>
[3] However, the Vestigial Sideband (VSB) transmission mode, which is adopted as the<br>
standard for digital broadcasting in North America and the Republic of Korea, is a<br>
system using a single carrier method. Therefore, the receiving performance of the<br>
digital broadcast receiving system may be deteriorated in a poor channel environment.<br>
Particularly, since resistance to changes in channels and noise is more highly required<br>
when using portable and/or mobile broadcast receivers, the receiving performance may<br>
be even more deteiiorated when transmitting mobile service data by the VSB<br>
transmission mode.<br>
f4) Moreover, in a conventional mobile digital broadcasting environment, it is the<br>
cunent reality that there is no concrete technology for setting or releasing a conditional<br>
access to a specific service.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[5J Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a digital broadcast receiver and a<br>
control method thereof that substantially obviates one or more problems due to<br>
limitations and disadvantages of the related ail.<br>
[6] An object of the present invention is to provide a digital broadcast receiver which is<br>
robust against a channel variation and noise, and a control method thereof.<br>
|7| Another object of the present invention is to provide a data processing method which<br>
is capable of setting or releasing a conditional access to a specific service in a mobile<br>
digital broadcasting environment.<br>
[8] Additional advantages, objects, and features of the invention will be set forth in part<br>
in the de.scription which follows and in part will become apparent to those having<br>
oidinury skill in the ait Lipt)n examination of the following or may be learned from<br>
practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention may be<br>
realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description<br>
and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
|9| To achieve these objects and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of<br>
the invention, as einbodied and broadly described herein, a control method of a digital<br>
broadcast receiver includes t!ie steps of receiving a broadcast signal into which mobile<br>
.service Uuia ariu main scr\'icc uuiU arc muitipicxcu, cxlructing tran.srTiiSSion paramCiCr<br>
channel (TPC) signaling infonnation and fast infomiaiion channel (FlC) signaling in-<br>
formation from a data group in the received mobile service data, acquiring a program<br>
table describing virtual channel information and a service of an ensemble by using the<br>
extracted FlC signaling information, the ensemble being a virtual channel group of the<br>
received mobile sei"vice data, detecting a conditional access descriptor indicating<br>
whether the mobile seiTice data was encrypted by using the acquired program table,<br>
and controlling such that the encrypted mobile service data is decrypted by using in-<br>
formation of the detected conditional access descriptor.<br>
[ lOJ In another aspect of the present invention, a digital broadcast receiver includes a<br>
reception unit, an extractor, an acquirer, a detector, and a controller. The reception unit<br>
receives a broadcast signal into which mobile service data and main service data are<br>
multiplexed. The extractor extracts transmission parameter channel signaUng in-<br>
formation and fast information channel signaling information from a data group in the<br>
received mobile service data. The acquirer acquires a program table describing virtual<br>
channel information and a service of an ensemble by using the extracted fast in-<br>
formation channel signaling information, the ensemble being a virtual channel group of<br>
the received mobile service data. The detector detects a conditional access descriptor<br>
indicating whether the mobile service data was encrypted by using the acquired<br>
program table. And the controller controls such that the encrypted mobile service data<br>
is decrypted by using information of the detected conditional access descriptor.<br>
(11] In a further aspect of the present invention, a control method of a digital broadcast<br>
transmitter includes the steps of generating a broadcast signal including a conditional<br>
access descriptor indicating whether mobile service data was encrypted, and<br>
transmitting the generated broadcast signal including the conditional access descriptor<br>
to a digital broadcast receiver side, wherein the conditional access descriptor includes<br>
infoixnation identifying respective levels at which the mobile service data was encryp<br>
ted, and infonnation about control data which is used for decryption of the encrypted<br>
mobile service data.<br>
<br>

Best IVlode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[611 Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like paits. In addition, although the terms used in the present invention are<br>
selected from generally known and used terms, some of the terins mentioned in the de-<br>
scription of the present invention have been selected by the applicant at his or her<br>
discretion, the detailed ineanings of which are described in relevant parts of the de-<br>
<br>
scriplion herein. I-urthermore, it is required thut the present invention is understood,<br>
not simply by the acaial temis used but by the meaning of each term lying within.<br>
[62] Among the tenns used in the description of the present invention, main service data<br>
coiTCspond to data that can be received by a fixed receiving system and may include<br>
audio/video (A/V) data. More specifically, the main service data may include A/V data<br>
of high definition (I ID) t)r standai'd definition (SD) levels and may al.so include diverse<br>
data types required for data broadcasting. Also, the known data corresponds to data<br>
prc-known in accordance with a pre-arranged agreement between the receiving system<br>
and the ti-aivsmitting system. Additionally, ;imong the terms used in the present<br>
invention, "IVIH" corresponds to the initials of "mobile"' and "handheld" and represents<br>
the opposite concept of a fixed-type system. Furthermore, the MH service data may<br>
include at least one of mobile sei'vice data and handheld sei-vice data, and canalso be<br>
referred to a.s "mobile service data" for simplicity. Herein, the mobile service data not<br>
only coiTBspond to MH service data but may also include any type of service data with<br>
mobile or poitable characteristics. Therefore, the mobile service data according to the<br>
present invention ai"e not limited only to the MH seiYice data.<br>
[631 Tlie above-de.scribed mobile service data may correspond to data having information,<br>
such as program execution files, stock information, and .so on, and may also<br>
coirespond to A/V data. Particularly, the mobile service data may correspond to A/V<br>
data having lower I'esolution and lower data rate as compared to the main service data.<br>
For example, if an A/V codec that is used for a conventional main service con-espond.s<br>
to a MPEG-2 codec, a MPEG-4 advanced video coding (AVC) or scalable video<br>
coding (SVC) having better image compression efficiency may be used as the A/V<br>
codec for the mobile service. Furthermore, any type of data may be transmitted as the<br>
mobile service data. For example, transport protocol expert group (TPF.G) data for<br>
broadcasting real-time transportation information may be transmitted as the mo-<br>
bileservice data.<br>
[64[ Also, a data service using the mobile service data may include weather forecast<br>
services, traffic infoimation services, stock infomnation services, viewer participation<br>
quiz programs, real-time polls and suiA'eys, interactive education broadcast programs,<br>
gaming services, services providing information on synopsis, character, background<br>
music, and filming sites of soap operas or series, services providing information on<br>
past match scores and player profiles and achievements, and services providing in-<br>
formation on product information and programs classified by service, medium, time^<br>
and theme enabling purchase ordere to be processed. Herein, the present invention is<br>
not limited only to the services mentioned above. In the present invention, the<br>
transmitting system provides backward compatibility in the main sei^vice data so as to<br>
be received by the conventional receiving system. Herein, the main service data and<br>
the" mobile service data are multiplexed to the same physical channel and then<br>
transmitted.<br>
(651 Funhermore, the digital broadcast transmitting system according to the present<br>
invention peifonus additional encoding on the mobile service data and inseits the data<br>
already known by the receiving system and transmitting system (e.g., known data),<br>
thereby transmitting the processed data. Therefore, when using the transmitting system<br>
according to the present invention, the receiving system may receive the mobile<br>
sci"vicc data during a mobile state and may also receive the mobile service data with<br>
stability tiespitc viirinus (.listortinn and noise (iccuriing within the channel.<br>
1661 FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram showing a stmcture of a digital broadcasting<br>
receiving system according to an embodiment of the present invention. The digital<br>
broadcast receiving system according to the present invention includes a baseband<br>
processor 100, a management proces.sor 200, and a presentation processor 300. The<br>
baseband proce.ssor 100 includes an operation controller 110, a tuner 120. a de-<br>
modulator 130, an equalizer 140, a known sequence detector (or known data detector)<br>
150, a block decoder (or mobile handheld block decoder) 160, a primary Reed-<br>
Solomon (RS) frame decoder 170, a secondary RS frame decoder 180, and a signaling<br>
decoder 190. The operation controller 110 controls the operation of each block<br>
included in the baseband processor 100.<br>
[67] By tuning the receiving system to a specific physical channel frequency, the tuner<br>
120 enables the receiving system to receive main sen'ice data, which conespond to<br>
broadcast signals for fixed-type broadcast receiving systems, and mobile service data,<br>
which correspond to broadcast signals for mobile broadcast receiving systems. At this<br>
point, the tuned frequency of the specific physical channel is down-converted to an in-<br>
teiTnediate frequency (IF) signal, thereby being outputted to the demodulator 130 and<br>
the known sequence detector 140. The passbaiid digital IF signal being outpiitted from<br>
the tuner 120 may only include main service data, or only include mobile sen'ice data,<br>
or include both main service data and mobile service data.<br>
[68] The demodulator 130 perfonns self-gain control, carrier wave recovery, and timing<br>
recovery processes on the passband digital IF signal inputted from the tuner 120,<br>
thereby modifying the IF signal to a baseband signal. Then, the demodulator 130<br>
outputs the baseband signal to the equalizer 140 and the known sequence detector 150.<br>
The demcxlulator 130 uses the known data symbol sequence inputted from the known<br>
sequence detector 150 during the timing and/or carrier wave recoveiy, thereby<br>
enhancing the demodulating peifomiance. The equalizer 140 compensates channel-<br>
associated distortion included in the signal demodulated by the demodulator 130.<br>
Then, the equalizer 140 outputs the distortion-compensated signal to the blcok decoder<br>
160. By using a known data symbol sequence inputted from the Inown sequence<br>
<br>
detector 150, the equalizer 140 may enhance the equalizing peifonnance. Furtheimore,<br>
the equalizer 141) may receive feed-back on the decoding fesult from the block decoder<br>
160, thereby enhancing the equalizing performance.<br>
[69] The known sequence detector 150 detects kncnvn data place (or position) inserted by<br>
the transmitting system from the input/output data (i.e., data prior to being de-<br>
modulated or data being processed with paitial demodulation). Then, the known<br>
sequence detector 150 outputs the detected known data position infonnation and<br>
known data sequence generated from the detected position information to the de-<br>
moduh'.tor 130 and the cinalizcr 14'). Additionally, in order to allow the block decoder<br>
160 to identity the mobile service data that have been processed with additional<br>
encoding by the transmitting system and the main service data that have not been<br>
processed with any additional encoding, the knovvn se({uence detector 150 outputs such<br>
corresponding information to the block decoder 160.<br>
[70] If the data channel-equalized by the equalizer 140 and inputted to the bkx^k decoder<br>
160 coiTespond to data processed with both block-encoding and treUis-encoding by the<br>
transmitting system (i.e., data within the RS frainc, signaling data), (he block decoder<br>
160 may peifoim trellis-decoding and block-decoding as inverse processes of the<br>
transmitting system. On the other hand, if the data channel-equalized by the equalizer<br>
140 and inputted to the block decoder 160 correspond to data proces.sed only with<br>
trellis-encoding and not block-encoding by the transmitting system (i.e., main service<br>
data), the block decoder 160 may pertomi only trellis-decoding.<br>
]71 ] The signaling decoder 190 decodes signaling data that have been channel-equalized<br>
and inputted from the equalizer 140. It is assumed that the signaling data inputted to<br>
the signaling decoder 190 correspond to data processed with both block-encoding and<br>
trellis-encoding by the transmitting system. Examples of such signaling data may<br>
include transmission parameter channel (TPC) data and fast iiifonnation channel (FlC)<br>
data. Each type of data will be described in more detail in a later process. The FIC data<br>
decoded by the signaling decoder 190 aie outputted to the FIC handler 215. And, the<br>
TPC data decoded by the signlaing decoder 190 are outputted to the TPC handler 214.<br>
[72] Meanwhile, according to the present invention, the transmitting system uses RS<br>
frames by encoding units. Herein, the RS frame may be divided into a primary RS<br>
frame and a secondary RS frame. However, according to the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the primary RS frame and the secodnary RS frame will be divided<br>
based upon the level of importance of the conesponding data. The primai^ RS frame<br>
decoder 170 receives the data outputted from the block decoder 160. At this point,<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention, the primary RS frame decoder<br>
170 receives only the mobile service data that have been Reed-Solomon (RS)-encoded<br>
and/or cyclic reduncancy check (CRC)-encoded from the block decoder 160.<br>
<br>
1731 Herein, the primary RS frame decoder 170 receives (inly the mobile service data and<br>
not the main service data. 'Ihe primary RS frame decoder 170 perfonns inverse<br>
processes of an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast<br>
transmitting system, thereby correcting errors existing within the primaiy RS frame.<br>
More specifically, the primaiy RS frame decoder 170 forms a primary RS frame by<br>
grouping a plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in primary RS frame units.<br>
In other words, the primaiy RS frame dec(xler 170 decodes primary RS frames, which<br>
are being transmitted for actual broadcast services.<br>
[74! Additionally, the sccondaiy RS frame decoder I SO receives the dara outpiitted from<br>
the block decoder 160. At this point, according to the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data<br>
that have been RS-encoded and/or CRC-encodetl from the block decoder 160. Herein,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 receives only the mobile service data and not the<br>
main service data. The secondaiy RS frame decoder 180 perfonns inverse processes of<br>
an RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the digital broadcast transmitting system,<br>
thereby correcting enors existing within the secondary RS frame. More specifically,<br>
the secondary RS frame decoder 180 forms a secondary RS frame by grouping a<br>
plurality of data groups and, then, correct errors in secondary RS frame units. In other<br>
words, the secondary RS frame decoder 180 decodes secondaiy RS frames, which are<br>
being transmitted for mobile audio ser\'ice data, mobile video service data, guide data,<br>
and so on.<br>
[75J Meanwhile, the management processor 200 according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention includes an MH physical adaptation processor 210, an IP network<br>
stack 220, a streaming handler 230, a system information (SI) handler 240, a file<br>
handler 250, a multi-pui-pose internet main extensions (MIME) type handler 260, and<br>
an electronic service guide (ESG) handler 270, and an ESG decoder 280, and a storage<br>
unit 290. The MH physical adaptation processor 210 includes a primary RS frame<br>
handler 211, a secondary RS frame handler 212, an MH transport packet (TP) handler<br>
213, a TPC handler 214, an FIC handler 215, and a physical adpatation control signal<br>
handler 216. The TPC handler 214 receives and processes baseband information<br>
required by modules con^esponding to the MH physical adaptation processor 210. The<br>
baseband information is inputted in the form of TPC data. Herein, the TPC handler 214<br>
uses this information to process the FIC data, which have been sent from the baseband<br>
processor 100.<br>
[76] The TPC data istransmitted from the transmitting system to the receiving system via<br>
a predetermined region of a data group. The TPC data may include at least one of an<br>
MH ensemble ID, an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG), an<br>
RS frame continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC version<br>
<br>
<br>
number. Herein, the MI I ensemble ID indicates an identification number of each MH<br>
ensemble cairied in the corresponding physical channel. The MH sub-frame number<br>
signifies a number identifying the MH sub-frame number in oneMH frame, wherein<br>
each MH group associated with the corresponding MH ensemble is transmitted. The<br>
TNoG represents the total number of MH groups including all of the MH groups<br>
belonging to all MH parades included in oneMH sub-frame. The RS frame continuity<br>
counter indicates a number that serves as a continuity indicatorof the RS frames<br>
caiTving the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the value of the RS frame continuity<br>
counter shall be incremented by I modulo 1<s for cnch successive rs frame. n></s>
represents the column size of an RS frame belonging to the coiTesponding MH<br>
ensemble. Herein, the value of N determi nes the size of each MIT TP. Finally, the FTC<br>
vei-sion number signifies the version number of an FIC body carried on the cor-<br>
responding physical channel.<br>
[77] As described above, diverse TPC data are inputted to the TPC handler 214 via the<br>
signaling decoedr 190 shown in FIG. 1. Then, the received TPC data are processed by<br>
the TPC handler 214. The received TPC data may also be used by the FIC handler 215<br>
in order to process the FIC data. The FIC handler 215 processes the FIC data by as-<br>
sociating the FIC data received from the baseband processor 100 with the TPC data.<br>
The physical adaptation control signal handler 216 collects FIC data received through<br>
the FIC handler 215 and SI data received through RS frames. Then, the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216 uses the collected FIC data and SI data to<br>
configure and process IP datagrams and access information of mobile broadcast<br>
services. Thereafter, the physical adaptation control signal handler 216 stores the<br>
processed IP datagrams and access information to the storage unit 290.<br>
[78] The primary RS frame handler 211 identifies primary RS frames received from the<br>
primaiy RS frame decoder 170 of the baseband processoi' 100 for each row unit, so as<br>
to configui-e an MH TP. Thereafter, the primary RS frame handler 211 outputs the<br>
configured MH TP to the MH TP handler 213. The secondaiy RS frame handler 212<br>
identifies secondary RS frames received from the secondaiy RS frame decoder 180 of<br>
the baseband processor 100 for each row unit, so as to configure an MH TP.<br>
Thereafter, the secondaiy RS frame handler 212 outputs the configured MH TP to the<br>
MH TP handler 213. The MH transport packet (TP) handler 213 extracts a header from<br>
each MH TP received from the primary RS frame handler 211 and the secondaiy RS<br>
frame handler 212, thereby determining the data included in the corresponding MH TP.<br>
Then, when the determined data correspond to SI data (i.e., SI data that are not en-<br>
cap.sulated to IP datagrams), the corresponding data are outputted to the physical<br>
adaptation control signal handler 216. Alterantively, when the detemiined data<br>
conespond to an IP datagram, the corresponding data are outputted to the IP network<br>
<br>
<br>
Stack 220.<br>
[79] The IP network stack 220 processes broadcast data that are being transmitted in the<br>
form of IP datagrams. More specifically, the IP network stack 220 processes data that<br>
are inputted via user datagram protocol (UDP), real-time transport protcKoI (RTP),<br>
real-time transport control protocol (RTCP), asynchronous layered coding/layered<br>
coding transport (ALC/LCT), file delivery over unidirectional transport (FLUTE), and<br>
so on. Herein, when the pnx;essed data correspond to streaming data, the cor-<br>
responding data are outputtcd to the streaming handler 230. And, when the processed<br>
data correspond tf&gt; data in a file format, the i-firre'indniJing data are outpiitted to the file<br>
handler 250. Finally, when the pKx;essed data correspond to Sl-associated data, the<br>
conesponding data are outputted to the SI handler 240.<br>
[80] The SI handler 240 receives and processes SF data having the form of TP datagrams,<br>
which are inputted to the IP network stack 220. When the inputted data a.ssociated with<br>
SI correspond to MIME-type data, the inputted data are outputted to the MIME-type<br>
handler 260. The MIME-type handler 260 receives the MIME-type SI data outputted<br>
from the SI handler 240 and processes the received MEME-type SI data. The file<br>
handler 250 receives data from the IP network stack 220 in an object format in<br>
accordance with the ALC/LCT and FLUTE structures. The file handler 250 groups the<br>
received data to create a file format. Herein, when the corresponding file includes<br>
ESG(Electronic Sen'ice Guide), the tile is outputted to the ESG handler 270. On the<br>
other hand, when the corresponding file includes data for other file-based services, the<br>
file is outputted to the presentation controller 330 of the presentation processor 300.<br>
[81] The ESG handler 270 processes the ESG data received from the file handler 250 and<br>
stores the processed ESG data to the storage unit 290. Alternatively, the ESG handler<br>
270 may output the processed ESG data to the ESG decoder 280, thereby allowing the<br>
ESG data to be used by the ESG decoder 280. The storage luiit 290 stores the system<br>
hiformation (SI) received from the physical adaptation control signal handler 210 and<br>
the ESG handler 270 therein. Thereafter, the storage unit 290 transmits the stored SI<br>
data to each bkx'k.<br>
[82J The ESG decoder 280 either recovers the ESG data and SI data stored in the storage<br>
unit 290 or recovers the ESG data transmitted from the ESG handler 270. Then, the<br>
ESG decoder 280 outputs the recovered data to the presentation controller 330 in a<br>
format that can be outputted to the user. The streaming handler 230 receives data from<br>
the IP network stack 220, wherein the format of the received data are in accordance<br>
with RTP and/or RTCP structures. The streaming handler 230 extracts audio/video<br>
streams from the received data, which ai-e then outputted to the audio/video (A/V)<br>
decoder 310 of the presentation pi-ocessor 300. The audio/video decoder 310 then<br>
decodes each of the audio stream and video stream received from the streaming<br>
<br>
<br>
handler 230.<br>
[83 ] The display module 320 of the presentation processor 300 receives audio and video<br>
signals respectively decoded by the AA' decoder 310. Then, the display module 320<br>
provides the received audio and video signals to the user through a speaker and/or a<br>
screen. The presentation controller 330 con-esponds to a controller managing modules<br>
that output data received by the receiving system to the user. The channel service<br>
manager 340 manages an interface with the user, which enables the user to use<br>
channel-based broadcast services, such as channel map management, channel scnice<br>
coniiection, and so on. The application m^uiager ^50 manages an intertacc. with a user<br>
using ESG display or other application seniccs that do not correspond to channel-<br>
based services.<br>
[84] Meanwhile, the data structure used in the m.obile b!X&gt;adcasting technology according<br>
to the embodiment of the present invention may include a data group .structure and an<br>
RS frame structure, which will now be described in detail. FTG. 2 illustrates an<br>
exemplary structure of a data group according to the present invention. FIG. 2 shows<br>
an example of dividing a data group according to the data structure of the present<br>
invention into 10 MH blocks (i.e., MH block 1 (Bl) to MH block 10 (BIO)). In this<br>
example, each MH block has the length of 16 segments. Referring to FIG. 2, only the<br>
RS parity data are all(x;ated to portions of the first 5 segments of the MH bkx;k 1 (B1)<br>
and the last 5 segments of the MH block 10 (BIO). The RS parity data are excluded in<br>
regions A to D of the data group. More specifically, when it is assumed that one data<br>
group is divided into regions A, B, C, and D, each MH block may be included in any<br>
one of region A to region D depending upon the characteristic of each MH block<br>
within the data group(For example, the characteristic of each MH block can be an in-<br>
terference level of main service data).<br>
[85] Herein, the data group is divided into a plurality of regions to be used for different<br>
purposes. More specifically, a region of the main service data having no interference or<br>
a very low interference level may be considered to have a more resistant (or sti-onger)<br>
receiving performance as compared to regions having higher interference levels. Ad-<br>
ditionally, when using a system inserting and transmitting known data in the data<br>
group, wherein the known data are known based upon an agreement between the<br>
transmitting system and the receiving system, and when consecutively long known<br>
data are to be periodically inserted in the mobile service data, the known data having a<br>
predetermined length may be periodically inserted in the region having no interference<br>
from the main service data (i.e., a region wherein the main service data are not mixed).<br>
However, due to interference from the main .service data, it is difficult to periodically<br>
insert known data and also to insert consecutively long known data to a region having<br>
interfei^ence from the main service data.<br>
<br>
<br>
[86J Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 4 (B4) to MM block 7 (B7) con-espond to regions<br>
without interference of the main service data. MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7)<br>
within the data group shown in FIG. 2 correspond to a region where no interference<br>
from the main service data occurs. In this example, a long known data sequence is<br>
inseited at both the beginning and end of each MH block. In the description of the<br>
present invention, the region including MH block 4 (B4) to MH block 7 (B7) will be<br>
referred to as "region A (=B4+B5+B6+B7)". As described above, when the data group<br>
includes region A having a long known data sequence inscncd at both the beginning<br>
and end of each .MH block, the receiving system is capable of peifonning equalization<br>
by using the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore,<br>
region A may have the strongest equalizing perlbmiance among region A, B, C and D..<br>
[87] In the example of the data group shown in FIG. 2, MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8<br>
(B8) correspond to a region having little interference from the main service data.<br>
Herein, a long known data sequence is inserted in only one side of each MH blcKrk B3<br>
and B8. More specifically, due to the interference from the main service data, a long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the end of MH block 3 (B3), and another long<br>
known data sequence is inserted at the beginning of MH block 8 (B8). In the present<br>
invention, the region including MH block 3 (B3) and MH block 8 (B8) will be referred<br>
to as "region B (=B3+B8)". As described above, when the data group includes region<br>
B having a long known data sequence inserted at only one side (beginning or end) of<br>
each MH block, the receiving system is capable of performing equalization by using<br>
the channel information that can be obtained from the known data. Therefore, a<br>
stronger equalizing performance as compared to region C/D may be yielded (or<br>
obtained) in region B.<br>
[88] Referring to FIG. 2, MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) con-espond to a region<br>
having more interference from the main ser\'ice data as compared to region B. A long<br>
known data sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 2 (B2) and MH bkx:k<br>
9 (B9). Herein, the region including MH block 2 (B2) and MH block 9 (B9) will be<br>
referred to as "region C (=B2+B9)". Finally, in the example shown in FIG. 2, MH<br>
block 1 (Bl) and MH block 10 (BIO) correspond to a region having more interference<br>
from the main service data as compared to region C. Similarly, a long known data<br>
sequence cannot be inserted in any side of MH block 1 (31) and MH block lO(BlO).<br>
Herein, the region including MH block 1 (Bl) and MH block 10 (BIO) will be referred<br>
to as "region D (-B1+B10)". Since region C/D is spaced further apart from the known<br>
data sequence, when the channel environment undergoes frequent and abrupt changes,<br>
the receiving peifomiance of region C/D may be deteriorated.<br>
[89] Additionally, the data group includes a signaling information area wherein signaling<br>
information is assigned (or allocated). In the present invention, the signaling in-<br>
<br>
formation ai'ea may start from the 1st segment t)f the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion oF<br>
the 2nd segment. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the signaling<br>
infoimation area for inserting signaling infomnation may start from the 1st segment of<br>
the 4th MH block (B4) to a portion of the 2nd segment. More specifically,<br>
276(=207+69) bytes of the 4th MH block (B4) in each data group are assigned as the<br>
signaling information area. In other words, the signaling information area consists of<br>
207 bytes of the ist segment and the firet 69 bytes of the 2nd segment of the 4th MH<br>
block fB4). The 1st segment of the 4th MH block fB4) coiresponds to the 17th or<br>
173rd segment of a VSB field.<br>
[901 Herein, the signaling information may be identified by two different types of<br>
signaling channels: a transmission parameter channel (TPC) and a fast infonnation<br>
channel (FIC). Herein, the TPC data may include at least one of an Mil ensem.ble ID,<br>
an MH sub-frame number, a total number of MH groups (TNoG), an RS frame<br>
continuity counter, a column size of RS frame (N), and an FIC vereion number.<br>
However, the TPC data (or information) presented herein are merely exemplary. And,<br>
since the adding or deleting of signaling infcmiation included in the TPC data may be<br>
easily adjusted and modified by one skilled in the art, the present invention will,<br>
therefore, not be limited to the examples set forth herein. Furthermore, the FIC is<br>
provided to enable a fast sei-vice acquisition of data receivers, and the FIC includes<br>
cross layer information between the physical layer and the upper layer(s).<br>
[91] For example, when the data group includes 6 known data sequences, as shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the signaling information ai'ea is located between the first known data sequence<br>
and the second known data sequence. More specifically, the fii^st known data sequence<br>
is inserted in the last 2 segments of the 3rd MH block (B3), and the second known data<br>
sequence isinserted in the 2nd and 3rd segments of the 4th MH block (B4).<br>
Furthermore, the 3rd to 6th known data sequences are respectively inserted in the last 2<br>
segments of each of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th MH blocks (B4, B5, 86, and B7). The 1st<br>
and 3rd to 6th known data sequences are spaced apart by 16 segments.<br>
[92] FIG. 3 illustrates an RS frame according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The RS frame shown in FIG. 3 corresponds to a collection of one or more data groups.<br>
The RS frame is received for each MH frame in a condition where the receiving<br>
system receives the FIC and processes the received FIC and where the receiving<br>
system is switched to a time-slicing mode so that the receiving system can receive MH<br>
ensembles including ESG entry points. Each RS frame includes each service or IP<br>
streams of ESG, and SMT section data may exist in all RS frames. The RS frame<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention consists of at least one MH<br>
transport packet (TP). Herein, the MH TP includes an MH header and an MH payload.<br>
[93] The MH payload may include mobile service data as wekk as signaling data. More<br>
<br>
<br>
specifically, an MH payload may include t)nly mobile sei-vice data, or may include<br>
only signaling data, or may include both mcibile seiTice data and signaling data.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the MH header may identify (or<br>
distinguish) the data types incUided in the MH payload. More specifically, when the<br>
MH TP includes a first MH header, this indicates that the MH payload includes only<br>
the signaling data. Also, when the MH TP includes a second MH header, this indicates<br>
that the MH payload includes both the signaling data and the mobile service data.<br>
Finally, when Mil TP includes a third MH header, this indicates that the MH payload<br>
includes onl^^ the mobile scr\'ice data !n the exam'^le shown in FI^ 3 ^h*^ ^S ^v^imp it^<br>
assigned with IP datagrams (for example, IP datagram 1 and IP datagram 2) for two<br>
service types.<br>
[94] FIG. 4 illustrates a structure of a MH frame for transmitting and receiving mobile<br>
service data according to the present invention. In the example shown in FIG. 4, one<br>
MH frame consists of 5 sub-frames, wherein each sub-frame includes 16 slots. In this<br>
case, the MH frame according to the present invention includes 5 sub-frames and 80<br>
slots. Also, in a packet level, one slot is configured of 156 data packets (i.e., transport<br>
stream packets), and in a symbol level, one slot is configured of 156 data segments.<br>
Herein, the size of one slot corresponds to one half (1/2) of a VSB field. More<br>
specifically, since one 2()7-byte data packet has the same amount of data as onedata<br>
segment, a data packet prior to being interleaved may also be used as a data segment.<br>
At this point, two VSB fields are grouped to form a VSB frame.<br>
[95] FIG. 5 illustrates an exemplaiy structure of a VSB frame, wherein one VSB frame<br>
consists of 2 VSB fields (i.e., an odd field and an even field). Herein, each VSB field<br>
includes a field synchronization segment and 312 data segments. The slot corresponds<br>
to a basic time unit for multiplexing the mobile service data and the main service data.<br>
Herein, one slot may either include the mobile sen'ice data or be configured only of the<br>
main service data. If the first 118 data packets within the slot correspond to a data<br>
group, the remaining 38 data packets become the main sen'ice data packets. In another<br>
example, when no data group exists in a slot, the corresponding slot is configured of<br>
156 main seiTice data packets. Meanwhile, when the slots are assigned to a VSB<br>
frame, an off-set exists for each assigned position.<br>
[96] FIG. 6 illustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a<br>
sub-frame ai^e assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a spatial area. And, FIG. 7 il-<br>
lustrates a mapping example of the positions to which the first 4 slots of a sub-frame<br>
are assigned with respect to a VSB frame in a chronological (or time) area. Refeiring<br>
to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, a 38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 1 st slot (Slot #0) is<br>
mapped to the 1st data packet of an cxid VSB field. A 38th data packet (TS packet #37)<br>
of a 2nd slot (Slot #1) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an odd VSB field. Also, a<br>
<br>
<br>
38th data packet (TS packet #37) of a 3nJ slot (Sk)t #2) is mapped to the 1st data<br>
packet of an even VSB field. And, a 3S:h data packet (TS packet #37) of a 4th slot<br>
(Slot #3) is mapped to the 157th data packet of an even VSB field. Similarly, the<br>
remaining 12 slots within the conesponding sub-frame are mapped in the subsequent<br>
VSB frames using the same method.<br>
[97] FICj. 8 illustrates an exemplary assignement order of data groups being assigned to<br>
one of 5 sub-frames, wherein the 5 sub-frames configure an MH frame. For example,<br>
the method of assigning data groups may be identically applied to all MH frames or<br>
differently applied to each Ml! frame. Furthermore, the method of assingiug data<br>
groups may be identically applied to all sub-frames or differently applied to each sub-<br>
frame. At this point, when it is assumed that the data groups are assigned using the<br>
same method in all sub-frames of the corresponding MH frame, the total number of<br>
data groups being assigned to an MH frame is equal to a multiple of '5'. According to<br>
the embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of consecutive data groups is<br>
assigned to be spaced as far apart from one another as possible within the sub-frame.<br>
Thus, the system can be capable of responding promptly and effectively to any burst<br>
eiTor that may occur within a sub-frame.<br>
1981 For example, when it is assumed that 3 data groups are assigned to a sub-frame, the<br>
data groups are assigned to a 1st slot (Slot #0), a 5th slot (Slot #4), and a 9th slot (Slot<br>
#8) in the sub-frame, respectively. FIG. 8 illustrates an example of assigning 16 data<br>
groups in one sub-frame using the above-de.scribed pattern (or rule). In other words,<br>
each data group is serially assigned to 16 slots corresponding to the following<br>
numbers: 0, 8, 4, 12, 1, 9, 5, 13, 2, 10, 6, 14, 3, II, 7, and 15. Equation 1 below shows<br>
the above-described rule (or pattern) for assigning data groups in a sub-frame.<br>

[108]<br>
[ 109] Herein, j indicates the slot number within a sub-frame. The value of j may range from<br>
0 to 15. Also, vaiiable i indicates the data group number. The value of i may range<br>
from 0 to 15.<br>
[110] In the present invneiton, a collection of data groups included in a MH frame will be<br>
<br>
<br>
referred to as a "parade". Based upon the RS frame mode, the parade transmits data of<br>
at least one specific RS frame. The mobile service data within one RS frame may be<br>
assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D within the con^esponding data group, or to at<br>
least one of regions A/B/C/D. In the embodiment of the present invention, the mobile<br>
service data within one RS frame may be assigned either to all of regions A/B/C/D, or<br>
to at least (jne of regions A/B and regions C/D. If the mobile service data are assigned<br>
to the latter case (i.e., one of regions A/B and regions C/D), the RS frame being<br>
assigned to regions A/B and the RS frame being assigned to regions C/D within the<br>
corresponding' data "roup are different troin one jinother.<br>
11111 According to the embtxliment of the present invention, the RS frame being assigned<br>
to regions A/B within the coiresponding data group will he refeired to as a "piimary<br>
.RS frame", and the RS .frame being assigned to regions C/D within the cori'esponding<br>
data group will be referred to as a "secondary RS frame", for simplicity. Also, the<br>
primary RS frame and the secondary RS frame fonn (or configure) one parade. More<br>
specifically, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned either to<br>
all of regions A/B/C/D within the coiTesponding data group, one parade transmits one<br>
RS frame. Conversely, when the mobile service data within one RS frame are assigned<br>
either to at least one of regions A/B and regions C/D, one parade may transmit up to 2<br>
RS frames. More specifically, the RS frame mode indicates whether a parade transmits<br>
one RS frame, or whether the parade transmits two RS frames. Such RS frame mode is<br>
transmitted as the ab(we-described TPC data. Table 1 below shows an example of the<br>
RS frame mode.<br>

[114]<br>
[115J Table 1 illustrates an example of allocating 2 bits in order to indicate the RS frame<br>
inode. For example, referring to Table 1, when the RS frame mode value is equal to<br>
<br>
"00% this indicates that one parade transmits one RS frame. And, when the RS frame<br>
mode value is equal to '01', this indicates that one parade transmits two RS frames,<br>
i.e., the primaiy R.S frame and the secondai-y R.S frame. More .specifically, when the<br>
RS frame mode value is equal to '01', data of the primary RS frame for regions A/B<br>
are assigned and transmitted to regions A/B of the corresponding data group. Similarly,<br>
data of the secondary RS frame for regions C/D are assigned and transmitted to regions<br>
C/D of the coiresponding data group.<br>
[116! As described in the assignment of data groups, the parades are also assigned to be<br>
spaced as far apart fro.T. one another as po.';sib!c within the .sub-frame. Thus, the system<br>
can be capable of responding promptly and effectively lo any burst err(.)r that may<br>
occur within a sub-frame. Furthermore, the method of assigning parades may be<br>
identically applied to all MH frames or differently applied lo each Mf-I fram.e.<br>
According to the embodiment of the present invention, the parades may be assigned<br>
differently for each sub-frame and identically for all sub-frames within an MH frame.<br>
However, according to the embodiment of the present invention, the parades may be<br>
assigned differently for each MH frame and identically for all sub-frames within an<br>
MH frame. More specifically, the MH frame stiiicture inay vary by MH frame units.<br>
Thus, an ensemble rate may be adjusted on a more frequent and flexible basis.<br>
[117] FIG. 9 illustrates an example of multiple data groups of a single parade being<br>
assigned (or allocated) to an MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 9 illustrates an<br>
example of a single parade, wherem the number of data groups included in a sub-frame<br>
is equal to '3', being allocated to an MH frame. Referring to FIG. 9, 3 data groups are<br>
sequentially assigned lo a sub-frame at a cycle period of 4 slots. Accordingly, when<br>
this process is equally performed in the 5 sub-frames included in the corresponding<br>
MH frame, 15 data groups are assigned to a single MH frame. Herein, the 15 data<br>
groups coiTespond to data groups included in a parade. Therefore, since one sub-frame<br>
is configured of 4 VSB frame, and since 3 data groups are included in a sub-frame, the<br>
data group of the corresponding parade is not assigned to one of the 4 VSB frames<br>
within a sub-frame.<br>
[118] For example, when it is assumed that one parade transmits one RS frame, and that a<br>
RS frame encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system perfonns RS-<br>
encoding on the corresponding RS frame, thereby adding 24 bytes of parity data to the<br>
corresponding RS frame and transmitting the processed RS frame, the parity data<br>
occupy approximately 11.37% (=24/(187-t-24)x]00) of the total RS code word length.<br>
Meanwhile, when one sub-frame includes 3 data groups, and when the data groups<br>
included in the parade are assigned, as shown in FIG. 9, 15 data groups form an RS<br>
frame. Accordingly, even when an eiTor occurs in an entire data group due to a burst<br>
noise within a channel, the percentile is merely 6.67% (=1/15x100). Therefore, the<br>
<br>
<br>
receiving system may correct all errors by pertbrming an erasure RS decoding process.<br>
More specifically, when the erasure RS decoding is performed, a number of channel<br>
em)|-s corresponding to the number of RS parity bytes may be corrected and bytes error<br>
among one RS code word that is less than the number of RS parity bytes may be<br>
coirected. By doing so, the receiving system may correct the eixor of at least one data<br>
group within one parade. Thus, the minimum burst noise length correctable by a RS<br>
frame is over 1 VSB frame.<br>
[119] Meanwhile, when data groups of a pai'adc are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, either<br>
<br>
responding to different parades may be assigned between each data group. More<br>
specifically, data groups corresp<. to multiple parades may be assigned one></.>
MH frame. Basically, the method of assigning data groups corresponding to multiple<br>
parades is similai" to the method of assigning data groups corresponding to a single<br>
parade. In other words, data groups included in other parades that are to be assigned to<br>
an MH frame are also respectively assigned according to a cycle period of 4 slots. At<br>
this point, data groups of a different parade may be sequentially assigned to the<br>
respective slots in a circular method. Herein, the data groups are assigned to slots<br>
starting from the ones to which data groups of the previous parade have not yet been<br>
assigned. For example, when it is assumed that data groups coiTesponding to a parade<br>
are assigned as shown in FIG. 9, data groups corresponding to the next parade may be<br>
assigned to a sub-frame starting either from the 12th slot of a sub-frame. However, this<br>
is merely exemplary. In another example, the data groups of the next parade may also<br>
be sequentially assigned to a different slot within a sub-frame at a cycle peiiod of 4<br>
slots starting from the 3rd slot.<br>
[120] FIG. 10 illustrates an example of transmitting 3 parades (Parade #0, Parade #1, and<br>
Parade #2) viaan MH frame. More specifically, FIG. 10 illustrates an example of<br>
transmitting parades included in one of 5 sub-fi^ames, wherein the 5 sub-frames<br>
configure one MH frame. When the 1st pai-ade (Parade #0) includes 3 data groups for<br>
each sub-frame, the positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be<br>
obtained by substituting values '0' to '2' for i in Equation 1. More specifically, the<br>
data groups of the 1st parade (Pai'ade #0) are sequentially assigned to the 1st, 5th, and<br>
9th slots (Slot #0, Slot #4, and Slot #8) within the sub-frame. Also, when the 2nd<br>
parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the positions of each data groups<br>
within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting values '3' and '4' for i in<br>
Equation 1. More specifically, the data groups of the 2nd parade (Parade # 1) are se-<br>
quentially assigned to the 2nd and 12th slots (Slot #1 and Slot #11) within the sub-<br>
frame. Finally, when the 3rd parade includes 2 data groups for each sub-frame, the<br>
positions of each data groups within the sub-frames may be obtained by substituting<br>
<br>
<br>
values '5' and "6' tor i in Equation 1. More specil ically, the data groups of the 3rd<br>
parade (Parade #2) are sequentially assigned to the 7th and 11 th slots (Slot #6 and Slot<br>
#10) within the sub-frame.<br>
1121 j As described above, data gmups of multiple parades may be assigned to a single MH<br>
frame, and, in each sub-frame, the data groups are serially allocated to a group space<br>
having 4 slots from left to right. Therefore, a number of groups of one parade per sub-<br>
frame (NoG) may correspond to any one integer from ' T to '8'. Herein, since one MH<br>
frame includes 5 sub-frames, the total number of data groups within a parade that can<br>
be allocated to an ^'IH trame ma^^ coitcsooivJ to any one multiple of '5' ran^in*"^ from<br>
•5'to'40'.<br>
f 122] FIG. 11 illustrates an example of expanding the assignment process ol' 3 parades.<br>
shown in RG. 10, to 5 sub-frames within an MH frame. FIG. 12 illustrates a data<br>
transmission structure according to an embcxliment of the present invention, wherein<br>
signaling data are included in a data group so as to be transmitted. As described above,<br>
an MH frame is divided into 5 sub-frames. Data groups coixesponding to a plurality of<br>
parades co-exist in each sub-frame. Herein, the data groups corresponding to each<br>
parade are grouped by MH fram units, thereby configuring a single parade.<br>
11231 The data structure shown in FIG. 12 includes 3 parades, one ESG dedicated channel<br>
(EDC) parade (i.e., parade with N(;)G=I), and 2 service parades (i.e., parade with<br>
NoG=4 and parade with NoG=3). Also, a predetermined portion of each data gniup<br>
(i.e., 37 bytes/data group) is used for delivering (or sending) FIC information<br>
associated with mobile service data, wherein the FIC information is separately encoded<br>
from the RS-encoding process. The FIG region assigned to each data group consists of<br>
one FIC segments. Herein, each FIC segment is interleaved by MH sub-frame units,<br>
thereby configuring an FIC body, which coiresponds to a completed FIC transmission<br>
structure. However, whenever required, each FIC segment may be interleaved by MH<br>
frame units and not by MH sub-frame units, thereby being completed in MH frame<br>
units.<br>
[124J Meanwhile, the concept of an MH ensemble is applied in the embodiment of the<br>
present invention, thereby defining a collection (or group) of services. Each MH<br>
ensemble cairies the same QoS and is coded with the same FEC code. Also, each MH<br>
ensemble has the same unique identifier (i.e., ensemble ID) and corresponds to<br>
consecutive RS frames. As shown in FIG. 12, the FIC segment corresponding to each<br>
data group may describe service information of an MH ensemble to which the cor-<br>
responding data group belongs. When FIC segments within a sub-frame are grouped<br>
and deinterieved, all seiTice information of a physical channel through which the cor-<br>
responding FICs are transmitted may be obtained. Therefore, the receiving system may<br>
be able to acquire the channel information of the conesponding physical channel, after<br>
<br>
<br>
being processed with physical channel tuning, during a sub-frame period. FLirthermore,<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates a structure further including a separate EDC parade apart from the<br>
service parade and wherein electronic service guide (HSG) data are transmitted in the<br>
1st slot of each sub-frame.<br>
[ 1251 FIG. 13 illustrates a hierarchical signaling stmcture according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As shown in FIG. 13, the mobile broadcasting techonology<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention ad()pts a signaling method using<br>
FfC and SMT. In the description of the present invention, the signaling structure will<br>
be referred to as a hierarchical siiinaiing structure. F-lereinaftcr, a detailed description<br>
on how the receiving system accesses a virtual channel via FlC and SNTI v/ill now be<br>
given with reference to FIG. 13. The FIC b(xJy defined in an IVIH transport (Ml)<br>
identifies the physical location of each the data stream for each viitual channel and<br>
provides very high level descriptions of each virtual channel. Being MH ensemble<br>
level signaling information, the service map table (SMT) pmvides MH ensemble level<br>
signaling information. The SMT provides the IP access information of each virtual<br>
channel belonging to the respective MH ensemble within which the SMT is carried.<br>
The SMT also provides all IP stream component level information required for the<br>
virtual channel service acquisition.<br>
[126] Referring to FIG. 13, each MH ensemble (i.e.. Ensemble 0, Ensemble 1,...,<br>
Ensemble K) includes a stream infonnation on each a.sscK;iated (or corresponding)<br>
virtual channel (e.g., viitual channel 0 IP stream, virtual channel 1 IP stream, and<br>
virtual channel 2 IP stream). For example. Ensemble 0 includes viitual channel 0 IP<br>
stream and virtual channel 1 IP stream. And, each MH ensemble includes diverse in-<br>
formation on the associated viitual channel (i.e., Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry,<br>
Virtual Channel 0 Access Info, Virtual Channel 1 Table Entry, Virtual Channel I<br>
Access Info, Virtual Channel 2 Table Entry, Viitual Channel 2 Access Info, Viraial<br>
Channel N Table Entry, Virtual Channel N Access Info, and .so on). The FIC body<br>
payload includes information on MH ensembles (e.g., ensemble_id field, and referred<br>
to as "ensemble location" in FIG. 13) and information on a virtual channel associated<br>
with the corresponding MH ensemble (e.g., major_channel_num field and<br>
minor_channel_num field, and referred to as "Virtual Channel 0", "Virtual Channel 1",<br>
..., "Viitual Channel N" in FIG. 13).<br>
[127] The application of the signaling structure in the receiving system will now be<br>
described in detail. When a user selects a channel he or she wishes to view<br>
(hereinafter, the user-selected channel will be refened to as "channel 0" for<br>
simplicity), the receiving system first parees the received FIC. Then, the receiving<br>
system acquires infoiTnation on an MH ensemble (i.e., ensemble location), which is<br>
associated with the virtual channel coiTesponding to channel 0 (hereinafter, the cor-<br>
<br>
<br>
responding Ml I ensemble will be referred to as "Ml I ensemble 0" for simplicity). By<br>
acquiring slots only corresponding to the MH ensemble (1 using the time-slicing<br>
method, the receiving system configures ensemble 0. The ensemble 0 configured as<br>
described above, includes an SMT on the associated viilual channels (including<br>
channel G) and IP streams on the coiresponding virtual channels. Therefore, the<br>
receiving system uses the SMT included in the MM ensemble 0 in order to acquire<br>
various information on channel 0 (e.g.. Virtual Channel 0 Table Entry) and stream<br>
access information on channel 0 (e.g., Virtual Channel 0 Access Info). The receiving<br>
s^'stem uses the stream ^iccess iiifoniiatioii on clmiiiicl 0 to receive onl^' the associiiUed<br>
IP streams, thereby pi-oviding channel 0 services to the user.<br>
[ 128J The digital broadcast receiving system according to the present invention adopts the<br>
fast information channel (FIC) for a faster access to a service that is currently being<br>
broadcasted. More specifically, the FTC handler 215 of FIG. 1 parses the FIC body,<br>
which corresponds to an FIC transmission structure, and outputs the parsed result to<br>
the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. FIG. 14 illustrates an exemplary<br>
FIC body format according to an embodiment of the present invention. According to<br>
the embtxJiment of the present invention, the FIC format consists of an FIC body<br>
header and an FIC bcxJy payload.<br>
[ 129] Meanwhile, according to the embodiment of the present invention, data are<br>
transmitted through the FIC body header and the FIC body payload in FIC segment<br>
units. Each FIC segment has the size of 37 bytes, and each FIC segment consists of a<br>
2-byte FIC segment header and a 35-byte FIC segment payload. More specifically, an<br>
FIC body configured of an FIC body header and an FIC body payload, is segmented in<br>
units of 35 bytes, which are then cairied in FIC segment payload within at least one of<br>
FIC segment, so as to be transmitted. In the description of the present invention, an<br>
example of iaserting one FIC segment in one data group, which is then transmitted,<br>
will be given. In this case, the receiving system receives a slot corresponding to each<br>
data group by using a time-slicing method.<br>
[130] The signaling decoder 190 included in the receiving system shown in FIG. 1 collects<br>
each FIC segment inserted in each data group. Then, the signaling decoder 190 uses<br>
the collected FIC segments to created a single FIC body. Thereafter, the signaling<br>
decoder 190 performs a decoding process on the FIC body payload of the created FIC<br>
body, so that the decoded FIC body payload coiresponds to an encoded result of a<br>
signaling encoder (not shown) included in the transmitting system. Subsequently, the<br>
decoded FIC body payload is outputted to the FIC handler 215. The FIC handler 215<br>
parses the FIC data included in the FIC body payload, and then outputs the parsed FIC<br>
data to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216. The physical adaptation<br>
conti'ol signal handler 216 uses the inputted FIC data to perform processes associated<br>
<br>
<br>
wilh MH ensembles, virtual channels, SMTs, and so on.<br>
11311 According to an embodiment of the present invention, when an FIC body is<br>
segmented, and when the size of the last segmented portion is smaller than 35 data<br>
bytes, it is assumed that the lacking number of data bytes in the FIC segment payioad<br>
is completed with by adding the same number of stxilTing bytes therein, so that the size<br>
of the last FIC segment can be equal to 35 data bytes. However, it is appoi-ent that the<br>
above-described data byte values (i.e., 37 bytes for the FIC segment, 2 bytes for the<br>
FIC segment header, and 35 bytes fur the FIC segment payioad) are merely exemplaiy,<br>
and will, therefore, not limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
1132) FIG. 15 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to an FIC<br>
segment according to an embodiment of the present invention. Herein, the FIC<br>
segment signifies a unit used for transmitting the FIC data. The FIC segment consists<br>
of an FIC segment header and an FIC segment payioad. Refeiring to FIG. 15, the FIC<br>
segment payioad coiTesponds to the portion starting from the 'for' loop statement.<br>
Meanwhile, the FIC segment header may include a FIC_type field, an eni3r_indicator<br>
field, an FIC„seg_number field, and an FlC_last_seg_number field. A detailed de-<br>
scription of each field will now be given.<br>
11331 The FlC_type field is a 2-bit field indicating the type of the corresponding FIC. The<br>
en-or_indicator field is a 1 -bit field, which indicates whether or not an error has<br>
occun^ed within the FIC segment duiing data transmission. If an error has occurred, the<br>
value of the errorjndicator field is set to ' 1'. More specifically, when an error that has<br>
failed to be recovered still remains during the configuration process of the FIC<br>
segment, the error_indicator field value is set to '1'. The eiTor_indicator field enables<br>
the receiving system to recognize the presence of an en'or within the FIC data. The<br>
FIC_seg_number field is a 4-bit field. Herein, when a single FIC body is divided into a<br>
plurality of FIC segments and transmitted, the FlC_seg_number field indicates the<br>
number of the corresponding FIC segment. Finally, the FIC_Iast_seg_number field is<br>
also a 4-bit field. The FIC_Iast_seg_number field indicates the number of the last FIC<br>
segment within the con"esponding FIC body.<br>
[134] FIG. 16 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure with respect to a payioad<br>
of an FIC segment according to the present invention, when an FIC type field value is<br>
equal to '0'. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the payioad of the<br>
FIC segment is divided into 3 different regions. A first region of the FIC segment<br>
payioad exists only when the FIC_seg_number field value is equal to '0'. Herein, the<br>
first region may include a current_next_indicator field, an ESG_version field, and a<br>
transport_stream_id field. However, depending upon the embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it may be assumed that each of the 3 fields exists regai"dless of the<br>
FIC_seg_number field.<br>
<br>
<br>
[1351 The cuiTeiit__next_indicalor field is a ]-bil field. The cuiTeiit_,nextJndicator field acts<br>
as an indicator identifying whether the conespnnding FIC data cany Mil ensemble<br>
configuration information of an MH frame including the cunent FIC segment, or<br>
whether the corresponding FIC data cairy MH ensemble configuration information of a<br>
next MH frame. The ESG_version field is a 5-bit field indicating ESG version in-<br>
formation. Herein, by providing version information on the service guide providing<br>
channel of the corresponding ESG, the ESG.version field enables the receiving system<br>
to notify whether or not the corresponding ESG has been updated. Finally, the<br>
transport_strcairt_id field is a 16-bit field acting as a unique identifier of a broadja.'it<br>
stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being transmitted,<br>
f 136] A second region of the FIC segment payload coiresponds to an ensemble loop<br>
region, which includes an ensemble_id field, an SLversion field, and a num_channel<br>
field. More specifically, the ensembleid field is an 8-bit field indicating identifiers of<br>
an MH ensemble through which MH services are transmitted. Herein, the ensemble_id<br>
field binds the MH services and the MH ensemble. The SI_version field is a 4-bit field<br>
indicating version information of SI data included in the corresponding ensemble,<br>
which is being transmitted within the RS frame. Finally, the num„channel field is an<br>
8-bit field indicating the number of virtual channel being transmitted via the cor-<br>
responding ensemble.<br>
[137] A third region of the FIC segment payload a channel loop region, which includes a<br>
channeMype field, a channel_activity Field, a CA_indicator field, a<br>
stand_alone_service_indicator field, a major_channel_num field, and a<br>
minor_channel_num field. The channel_type field is a 5-bit field indicating a service<br>
type of the corresponding virtual channel. F(jr example, the channel__type field may<br>
indicates an audio/video channel, an audio/video and data channel, an audio-only<br>
channel, a data-only channel, a file download channel, an ESG deliveiy channel, a no-<br>
tification channel, and so on. The channeLactivity field is a 2-bit field indicating<br>
activity information of the coiTcsponding virtual channel. More specifically, the<br>
channeLactivity field may indicate whether the cun-ent virtual channel is providing the<br>
cuirent service.<br>
[138] The CA_indicator field is a 1-bit field indicating whether or not a conditional access<br>
(CA) is applied to the current virtual channel. The stand_alone_service_indicator field<br>
is also a 1 -bit field, which indicates whether the seiTice of the corresponding virtual<br>
channel corresponds to a stand alone service. The major_channel_num field is an 8-bit<br>
field indicating a major channel number of the corresponding vinual channel. Finally,<br>
the minor_channel_num field is also an 8-bit field indicating a minor channel number<br>
of the conesponding virtual channel.<br>

(hereiiiufter refened to as '"SMT") according to the present invention. According to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is configured in an MPnG-2 private<br>
section format. However, this will not limit the scope and spirit of the present<br>
invention. The SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention includes<br>
desription information for each virtual channel within a single MH ensemble. And,<br>
additional infonTialit)n may further be included in each desciiptor area. Herein, the<br>
SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention includes at least one field<br>
and is transmitted from the transmitting sj'stem to the receiving system.<br>

MH TP within the RS frame. In this case, each of the RS frame decoders 170 and 180,<br>
shown in FIG. 1, decodes the inputted RS frame, respectively. Then, each of the<br>
dec(xled RS frames is outputted to the respective RS frame handler 2 i 1 and 212.<br>
Thereafter, each RS frame handler 211 and 212 identifies the inputted RS frame by<br>
row units, so as to create an MH TP, thereby outputting the created MH TP to the MH<br>
TP handler 213. When it is determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an<br>
SMT section based upon the header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP<br>
handler 213 parses the corresponding SMT section, so as to output the SI data within<br>
the parsed SMT section to the physical adaptation control signal handler 216.<br>
However, this is limited to when the SMT is not encapsulated to IP datagrams.<br>
[ 141 ] Meanwhile, when the SMT is encapsulated to IP datagrams, and when it is<br>
determined that the corresponding MH TP includes an SMT section based upon the<br>
header in each of the inputted MH TP, the MH TP handler 213 outputs the SMT<br>
section to the IP network stack 220. Accordingly, the IP network stack 220 performs IP<br>
and UDP processes on the inputted SMT section and, then, outputs the processed SMT<br>
section to the SI handler 240. The SI handler 240 parses the inputted SMT section and<br>
controls the system so that the pai'sed SI data can be stroed in the storage unit 290. The<br>
following corresponds to example of the fields that may be transmitted through the<br>
SMT.<br>
[ 142J The table_ id field cone.sponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer number, which indicates<br>
the type of table section being defined in the service map table(SMT). The<br>
ensemble_id field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field, which coiresponds to an ID value<br>
associated to the corresponding MH ensemble. Herein, the ensemb]e_id field may be<br>
assigned with a value ranging from range '0x00' to 'Ox3F'. It is preferable that the<br>
value of the ensemble_id field is derived from the parade_id of the TPC data, which is<br>
carried from the baseband processor of MH physical layer subsystem. When the cor-<br>
responding MH ensemble is transmitted through (or cairied over) the primary RS<br>
frame, a value of '0' may be used for the most significant bit (MSB), and the<br>
remaining 7 bits are used as the parade_id value of the associated MH parade (i.e., for<br>
<br>
<br>
the least significant 7 bits). Alternatively, when the coiresponding Mil ensemble is<br>
transmitted through (or carried over) the secondary RS frame, a value of ' I' may be<br>
used for the most significant bit (MSB).<br>
[ 143| The num_channels field is an 8-bit field, which specifies the number of virtual<br>
channels in the conesponding SMT section. Meanwhile, the SMT according to the em-<br>
bodimentof the present invention pn)vides information on a plurality of viraial<br>
channels using the 'for' loop statement. The major_channel_num field corresponds to<br>
an 8-bit field, which represents the major channel number associated with the cor-<br>
responding viitiial channel. Herein, the majt!r_char.;ieL;-!um field may be assigned<br>
with a value ranging from 'OxCKJ' to 'OxFF'. The min()r_channel_num field<br>
corresponds to an 8-bit field, which represents the minor channel number associated<br>
with the corresponding virtual channel. Herein, the minor^channeLnum field may be<br>
assigned with a value ranging from '0x00" to 'OxFF'.<br>
[1441 The short_channel_name field indicates the short name of the virtual channel. The<br>
service_id field is a 16-bit unsigned integer number (or value), which identifies the<br>
virtual channel seiTice. The servicc_type field is a 6-bit enumerated type field, which<br>
identifiesthe type of service cairied in the coiTCsponding virtual channel as defined in<br>
Table 2 below.<br>

[148] The viitual_channeL.activity field is a 2-bit enumerated field identifying the activity<br>
status of the corresponding viitual channel. When the most significant bit (MSB) of the<br>
virtual_channel_activity field is T, the virtual channel is active, and when the most<br>
significant bit (MSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '0', the viitual channel is<br>
<br>
<br>
inactive. Also, when the least signillcant bit (LSB) of the viilLial_channel_activity field<br>
is '1', the virtual channel is hidden (when set to I), and when the least significant bit<br>
(LSB) of the virtual_channel_activity field is '()', the virtual channel is not hidden. The<br>
num_components field is a 5-bit field, which specifies the number of IP stfeam<br>
components in the corresponding virtual channel. The lP„version_flag field<br>
coiresponds to a ]-bit indicator. More specifically, when the value of the<br>
lP._version_.flag field is set to ' 1', this indicates that a source_iP_address field, a<br>
virt!jal_channel_tai-get_rP_address field, and a componcnt_targct_lP_addrcss field are<br>
IPv6 addicsscs. AltciTiativcly, v.'hcn the value of the lP.,vcrsiori_flag field is set to '0',<br>
this indicates that the souice_iP_address field, the virtQal_channcl_target_IP_address<br>
Held, and the component_target_IP_address field are IPv4 addresses.<br>
[ 149] The soiirce_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, v.'hich indicates, when set,<br>
that a source IP address of the corresponding virtual channel exist for a specific<br>
multicast source. The virtual_channel_taiget_lP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean<br>
flag, which indicates, when set, that the conesponding IP stream component is<br>
delivered through IP datagrams with taiget IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_!P_address. Therefore, when the flag is set, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) uses the component_target_IP_address as the target_IP_address in<br>
order to access the corresponding IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving<br>
system (or receiver) may ignore the viraial_channel_ tai-get_IP_address field included<br>
in the num_.channels loop.<br>
[150J The source_IP_address field corresponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field. Herein, the<br>
source_IP_address field will be significant (or present), when the value of the<br>
source_IP.,address_flag field is set to M'. However, when the value of the<br>
source_IP._address_flag field is set to '0', the source_JP_address field will become in-<br>
significant (or absent). More specifically, when the source_lP_address_flag field value<br>
is set to '1', and when the IP_version_flag field value is set to '0', the<br>
soiirce_IP_address tield indicates a 32-bit IPv4 address, which shows the source of the<br>
coiTesponding virtual channel. Alternatively, when the IP_version_flag field value is<br>
set to T, the source_IP_address field indicates a J 28-bit IPv6 address, which shows<br>
the source of the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
[ 1511 The virtual_channel_target_IP_address field also conesponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit<br>
field. Herein, the VLrtual_channel_target_IP_address field will be significant (or<br>
present), when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_tlag field is set to<br>
' 1'. However, when the value of the virtual_channel_target_IP_address_fiag field is set<br>
to '0', the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field will become insignificant (or<br>
absent). More specifically, when the virtual_channeLtarget_IP_address_flag field<br>
value is set to '1', and when the IP_version_tlag field value is set to '0', the<br>
<br>
<br>
virtual_i:hannel_target_IP_a(Jdiess lield indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address<br>
associated to the corresponding virtual ciiannel. Alternatively, when the<br>
virtua]_channel_target_IP_addressJ1ag field value is set to '1', and when the<br>
IP_vcrsion_flag field value is set to M', the viraiaLchanneLtarget_IP_address field<br>
indicates a 64-bit target IPv6 address associated to the corresponding virtual channel.<br>
If the virtual_channel_target_IP_address field is insignificant (or absent), the<br>
component _target_IP_address field within the num_channels loop should become<br>
significant (or present). And, in order to enable the receiving system to access the IP<br>
stream coriiporicni, the componcnt_targCt_!P_addrcs:; field should be used.<br>
1152] Meanwhile, the SMT according to the embodiment of the present invention uses a<br>
'for' loop statement in order to provide information on a plurality of ct)mponents.<br>
Merein, the RTP_payload_type field, which is assigned with 7 bits, identifies the<br>
encoding format of the component based upon Table 3 shown below. When the IP<br>
stream component is not encapsulated to RTP, the RTP_payload_type field shall be<br>
ignored (or deprecated). Table 3 below shows an example of an RTP payload type.<br>

[156] The component_target_IP_address_flag field is a 1-bit Boolean flag, which indicates,<br>
when set, that the coiresponding IP stream component is delivered through IP<br>
datagrams with target IP addresses different from the<br>
virtual_channel_target_IP_address. Furthermore, when the<br>
component_target_IP_address_fIag is set, the receiving system (or receiver) uses the<br>
component_target_IP_address field as the target IP address to access the corresponding<br>
IP stream component. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) will ignore the<br>
virtual_channel_target_lP_address field included in the num_channels loop. The<br>
component_target_IP_address field con-esponds to a 32-bit or 128-bit field. Herein,<br>
when the value of the rP_version_flag field is set to '0', the<br>
component_target_IP_address field indicates a 32-bit target IPv4 address associated to<br>
the corresponding IP stream component. And, when the value of the IP_version_flag<br>
<br>
<br>
field is set to '1', the comp()nent_target_IP_addre.ss field indicates a 128-bit target<br>
IPv6 address associated to the corresponding IP stream component.<br>
[157] The port_niinn_coiint field is a 6-bit field, which indicates the numher of UDP ports<br>
ass(x;iated with the corresponding IP stream component. A target UDP port number<br>
value starts from the target_UDP_port_num field value and increases (or is in-<br>
cremented) by 1. For the RTP stream, the target UDP port number should start from<br>
the target_UDP_.port..num field value and shall increase (or be incremented) by 2. This<br>
is to incoiporate RTCP streams associated with the RTP streams.<br>
1 ijo| Tlic tdiget_UDP_poit_nuni field is a 1 fi-bit unsigned integer field, v.'hich represents<br>
the target UDP port number for the coiTesponding IP stream component. When used<br>
for RTP streams, the value of the targct_UDP_port_num field shall correspond to an<br>
even number. And, the next higher value shall represent the target UDP port number of<br>
the associated RTCP stream. The component_level_descriptor() represents zero or<br>
more descriptors providing additional information on the corresponding IP stream<br>
component. The viitual_channel_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors<br>
providing additional information for the corresponding virtual channel. The<br>
ensemble_level_descriptor() represents zero or more descriptors providing additional<br>
infoiTTiation for the MH ensemble, which is described by the corresponding SMT.<br>
[159] FIG. 18 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH audio<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. When at least one audio service is prese<br>
nt as a component of the cuirent event, the MH_audio_descriptor() shall be used as a<br>
component_level_descriptor of the SMT. The MH_audio_descriptor() may be capable<br>
of informing the system of the audio language type and stereo mode status. If there is<br>
no audio service ass(x;iated with the current event, then it is preferable that the<br>
MH_audio_.descriptor() is considered to be insignificant (or absent) for the current<br>
event. Each field shown in the bit stream syntax of FIG. 18 will now be described in<br>
detail.<br>
[160] The descriptor_tag field is an 8-bit unsigned integer having a TBD value, which<br>
indicates that the corresponding descriptor is the MIT audio_descriptor(). The<br>

bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptor_length field up to the end of<br>
the MH_audio_descriptor(). The channel_configuration field corresponds to an 8-bit<br>
field indicating the number and configuration of audio channels. The values ranging<br>
from ' 1' to '6' respectively indicate the the number and configuration of audio<br>
channels as given for "Default bit stream index number" in Table 42 of TSO/lEC<br>
13818-7:2006. All other values indicate that the number and configuration of audio<br>
channels are undefined.<br>
[161] The sample_rate_code field is a 3-bit field, which indicates the sample rate of the<br>
<br>
<br>
encDded audio data. Herein, tlie indication may correspond to one specific sample rate,<br>
or may correspond to a set of values that include the sample rate (rf the encoded audio<br>
data as defined in Table A3.3 of ATSC A/52B. The bit_rate_code field cotrcsponds to<br>
a 6-bit field. Herein, among the 6 bits, the lower 5 bits indicate a nominal bit rate.<br>
More specifically, when the most significant bit (.V1.SB) is '0', the corresponding bit<br>
rate is exact. On the other hand, when the most significant bit (MSB) is T, the bit rate<br>
con^esponds to an upper limit as defined in Table A3.4 of ATSC A/53B. The<br>
lSO_639_language_code field is a 24-bit (i.e., 3-byte) field indicating the language<br>
used for the audio stream component, in conformance with ISO 639.2/'B [xj. When a<br>
specific language is not present in the corresponding audio stream component, the<br>
value of each byte will be set to '0x0(1'.<br>
[ 162] FIG. 19 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax stiiicture of an Mil RTP payioad<br>
type descriptor according to the present invention. The<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() specifies the RTP payioad type. Yet, the<br>
MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() exists only when the dynamic value of the<br>
RTP_payload_type field within the num_components kx)p of the SMT is in the range<br>
of '96' to '127'. The ]VlH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() is used as a<br>
componentJeveLdescriptor of the SMT. The MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor<br>
translates (or matches) a dynamic RTP_payIoad_type field value into (or with) a<br>
MIME type. Accordingly, the receiving system (or receiver) may collect (or gather) the<br>
encoding fomiat of the IP stream component, which is encapsulated in RTP. The fields<br>
included in the MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor() will now be described in detail,<br>
f 163] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_RTP_payload._type<br>
_descriptor(). The descriptor_length field also coiTesponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer,<br>
which indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptor_length field up to the end of the MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptorO. The<br>

specifies the length (in bytes) of the MlME_type field. The MIME_type field indicates<br>
the MIME type corresponding to the encoding format of the IP stream component,<br>
which is described by the MH_RTP_payload_type_descriptor().<br>
[ 164] FIG. 20 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH current event<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. The MH_current_event_descriptor()<br>
shall be used as the virtual_channel__leveLdescriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
MH_current_event_descriptor() provides basic infomiation on the cuirent event (e.g.,<br>
the start time, duration, and title of the current event, etc.), which is transmitted via the<br>
<br>
respective virtual channel. The fields included in the MH_cuiTent_event_descript()r()<br>
will now be described in detail.<br>
[1651 The de.script()r_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the cunent descriptor as the MH_cuiTent_event_descriptor().<br>
The descriptor_length field also couesponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which<br>
indicates the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the<br>
descriptor^ length field up to the end of the MH_ciuTent__event_de.scriptor(). The<br>
current_event_stajt_tLi'ne field corresponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer tiuantity. The<br>
cuiTcr&gt;t_cvcnt_start_timc field rcprc;;cr.ts th.c start time of the current ovq'M a;id, more<br>
specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00 U TC, January 6, 1980. The<br>
current_event_duration field corresponds to a 24-bit field. Herein, the<br>
cun'ent_cvcnt_durution field indicates the duration of the current event in hours,<br>
minutes, and seconds (for example, wherein the fonnat is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD - 24<br>
bits). The title_length field specifies the length (in bytes) of the title_text field. Herein,<br>
the value '0' indicates that there are no titles existing for the con^esponding event. The<br>
title_text field indicates the title of the corresponding event in event title in the fonnat<br>
of a multiple string structure as defined in ATSC A/65C [xj.<br>
[ 166] FIG. 21 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH next event<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. The optional<br>
MH_next_event_descriptor() shall be used as the virtuaLchannel_level_desciiptor()<br>
within the SMT. Herein, the MH jext_event_descriptor() provides basic information<br>
on the next event (e.g., the start time, duration, and title of the next event, etc.), which<br>
is transmitted via the respective virtual channel. The fields included in the<br>
MH_next_event_descriptor() will now be described in detail.<br>
1167] The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identifies the current descriptor as the MH_next_event_descriptor(). The<br>
descriptor_length field also corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates<br>
the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descriptor_length field<br>
up to the end of the MH_next_event_descriptor(). The next__event_start_time field<br>
coiTesponds to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The next_event_start_time field<br>
represents the start time of the next event and, more specifically, as the number of GPS<br>
seconds since 00:00:00 UTC, Januaiy 6, 1980. The next_event_duration field<br>

format is in 6 digits, 4-bit BCD - 24 bits). The titlejength field specifies the length (in<br>
bytes) of the title_text field. Herein, the value '0' indicates that there are no titles<br>
existing for the con"esponding event. The title_text field indicates the title of the cor-<br>
responding event in event title in the fonnat of a multiple string stnjcture as defined in<br>

[1681 FfCi. 22 illustrates an exemplary bit stream syntax structure of an MH system time<br>
descriptor according to the present invention. The MH_system_time_descriptor() shall<br>
be used as the ensemble_level_descriptor() within the SMT. Herein, the<br>
lVlH_system_time_descriptor() provides inFormation on current time and date. The<br>
MH_system_time_descriptor() also provides information on the time zone in which the<br>
transmitting system (or transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast stream is<br>
located, while taking into consideration the mobile/portable characterstics of the MH<br>
service data. The liclds included in the Mll_systc;Ti__tiir,c_,dc;;criptor() v.'ill now be<br>
described in detail.<br>
116yj The descriptor_tag field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer having the value<br>
TBD, which identities the cunent descriptor as the Mll_system._time descriptorO. The<br>
descriptor_length field al.so corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned integer, which indicates<br>
the length (in bytes) of the portion immediately following the descrJptor_length field<br>
up to the end of the MH_system_time_descriptor(). The system_time field conesponds<br>
to a 32-bit unsigned integer quantity. The system_time field represents the current<br>
system time and, more specifically, as the number of GPS seconds since 00:00:00<br>
UTC, January 6, 1980. The GPS_UTC_offset field corresponds to an 8-bit unsigned<br>
integer, which defines the current offset in whole seconds between GPS and UTC time<br>
standards. In order to convert GPS time to UTC time, the GPS_UTC_offsel is<br>
subtracted from GPS time. Whenever the International Bureau of Weights and<br>
Measures decides that the current offset is too far in error, an additional leap second<br>
may be added (or subtracted). Accordingly, the GPS_UTC_offset field value will<br>
reflect the change.<br>
[ 170] The time_zone_offset_polarity field is a 1-bit field, which indicates whether the time<br>
of the time zone, in which the broadcast station is located, exceeds (or leads or is<br>
faster) or falls behind (or lags or is slower) than the UTC time. When the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '0', this indicates that the time on the<br>
cunent time zone exceeds the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone__offset_polarity<br>
field value is added to the UTC time value. Conversely, when the value of the<br>
time_zone_offset_polarity field is equal to '1', this indicates that the time on the<br>
cun'ent time zone falls behind the UTC time. Therefore, the time_zone_offset_polarity<br>
field value is subtracted from the UTC time value.<br>
[171] The time_zone_offset field is a 31 -bit unsigned integer quantity. More specifically,<br>
the time_zone_offset field represents, in GPS seconds, the time offset of the time zone<br>
in which the broadcast station is located, when compared to the UTC time. The<br>
daylight_savings field coiTesponds to a 16-bit field providing information on the<br>
Summer Time (i.e., the Daylight Savings Time). The time_zone field corresponds to a<br>
<br>
<br>
(5xS)-bit field iiidicaiing the time zone, in which the transmitting system (or<br>
transmitter) transmitting the corresponding broadcast stream is l(x.ated.<br>
[172] FIG. 23 illustrates segmentation and encapsulation processes of a service map table<br>
(SMT) according to the present invention. According to the present invention, the SMT<br>
is encapsulated to UDP, while including a target IF address and a target UDP poit<br>
number within the IP datagram. More specifically, the SMT is tlrst segmented into a<br>
predetermined number of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally en-<br>
capsulated to an IP header. In addition, the S.MT section provides signaling in-<br>
funnatioii on all virtual cliannel included in the MM ensemble including the cor-<br>
responding SMT section. At least one SMT section describing the MH ensemble is<br>
included in each RS frame included in the corresponding MH ensemble. Finally, each<br>
SMT section is Identified by an cnsemble_id included in each section. According to the<br>
embodiment of the present invention, by informing the receiving system of the target<br>
IP address and target UDP pott nurnber, the con-esponding data (i.e., target IP address<br>
and tai-get UDP port number) may be parsed without having the receiving system to<br>
request for other additional inforaiation.<br>
[173] FIG. 24 illustrates a flow chart for accessing a virtual channel using FIC and SMT<br>
according to the present invention. More specifically, a physical channel is tuned<br>
(S5()l). And, when it is determined that an MH signal exists in the tuned physical<br>
channel (S502), the corresponding MH signal is demodulated (S503). Additionally,<br>
FIC segments are grouped from the demcxiulated MH signal in sub-frame units (S504<br>
and S505). According to the embodiment of the present invention, an FIC segment is<br>
inserted in a data gaiup, so as to be transmitted. Mt)re specifically, the FIC segment<br>
coiTesponding to each data group described service information on the MH ensemble<br>
to which the corresponding data group belongs.<br>
[174] When the FIC segments aie grouped in sub-frame units and, then, deinterleaved, all<br>
service inforaiation on the physical channel through which the corresponding FIC<br>
segment is transmitted may be acquired. Therefore, after the tuning process, the<br>
receiving system may acquire channel information on the con-esponding physical<br>
channel during a sub-frame period. Once the FIC segments are grouped, in S504 and<br>
S505, a broadcast stream through which the corresponding FIC segment is being<br>
transmitted is identified (S506). For example, the broadcast stream may be identified<br>
by parsing the transport_stream_id field of the FIC body, which is configured by<br>
grouping the FIC segments. Furthermore, an ensemble identifier, a major channel<br>
number, a minor channel number, channel type infoimation, and so on, are extracted<br>
from the FIC body (S507). And, by using the extracted ensemble infoimation, only the<br>
slots coiTcsponding to the designated ensemble ai^e acquired by using the time-slicing<br>
method, so as to configure an ensemble (S508).<br>
<br>
<br>
11751 Subsequently, the RS tVume corresponding tc; the designated ensemble is decuded<br>
(S509), and an IP s(Kket is opened for SMT reception (S510). According to the<br>
example given in the embodiment of the present invention, the SMT is encapsulated to<br>
UDP, while including a target IP address and a target UDP port number within the IP<br>
datagram. More specifically, the SMT is first segmented into a predetermined number<br>
of sections, then encapsulated to a UDP header, and finally encapsulated to an IP<br>
header. According to the embodiment of the present invention, by informing the<br>
receiving system of the target IP address and target UDP poil number, the receiving<br>
sysiein paises the SMT ftcctions and the dcscriptcn's of each SMT section v.'ithciit<br>
requesting for other additional information (S511).<br>
[176] The SMT section provides signaling information on all virtual channel included in<br>
the MH ensemble including the coiresponding SMT section. At least one SMT section<br>
describing the MH ensemble is included in each RS frame included in the cor-<br>
responding MH ensemble. Also, each SMT section is identified by an ensemble_id<br>
included in each section. Furthermore each SMT provides IP access information on<br>
each virtual channel subordinate to the corresponding MH ensemble including each<br>
SMT. Finally, the SMT provides IP stream component level information required for<br>
the servicing of the corresponding virtual channel. Therefore, by using the information<br>
parsed from the SMT, the IP stream component belonging to the virtual channel<br>
requested for reception may be accessed (S513). Accordingly, the service associated<br>
with the corresponding virtual channel is provided to the user (S514).<br>
[ 177] Hereinafter, a digital broadcast receiving system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described in detail, based upon the desciiption of the present<br>
invention with reference to FIG. 1 to FIG. 24. Therefore, the description of FIG. 1 to<br>
FIG. 24 may be partially or entirely applied to the digital broadcast receiving system<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention. Evidently, the scope of the appe<br>

invention.<br>
[178] FIG. 25 shows a protocol stack of an MH system according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Hereinafter, with reference to FIG. 25, a brief description will be<br>
given of the protocol stack of the MH system according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[179] According to one embodiment of the present invention, a definition is given of a<br>
technology relating to encryption or decryption of data requuing a conditional access<br>
before data of an IP level, RTF level and raw level are transmitted through an MH<br>
transport layer and physical layer. Also, a definition is given of a signaling method for<br>
implementation of the above technology (for example, a protocol established between<br>
an MH encryption/deciyption layer and an MH signaling layer, or the like). Further, a<br>
<br>
<br>
definition is given of a method of controlling a conditional access-applied service<br>
when being oiitputted to an external interface.<br>
1180] The term "conditional access" is used throughout this specification. The "conditional<br>
access" con^esponds to a state in which mobile service data was encrypted (for<br>
example, scrambled) so that it can be used by only a specific user or specific digital<br>
broadcast receiver. For example, the "conditional access" may correspond to a ca.se<br>
where a conditional access function was set by a conditional access system (CA.S) or a<br>
control access system (CAS).<br>
I 1 o 11 Also, the term "control data" is used throughout this .specification. The "cop.trcl d:ita"<br>
corresponds to data required to remove the conditional access function of data to which<br>
the conditional access is applied. The "control data" may be named a "key value" and<br>
may be composed of, for example, an entitlement management message (EMM), en-<br>
titlement control message (ECM), or the like. Further, the ECM may include a control<br>
word (CW).<br>

digital broadcast receiver according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
processing conditional access-applied mobile service data will be described with<br>
reference to FIG. 26. For reference, the digital broadcast receivers of RGs. 1 and 26<br>
are similar in that they process a mobile digital broadcast, but the digital broadcast<br>
receiver of FIG. 26 is particularly characterized by that it can also process conditional<br>
access-applied mobile service data. Also, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate<br>
the operation of the digital broadcast receiver of FIG. 26 by refening to the entire de-<br>

[187] The secure handler 2660 includes a smart card interface 2661, secure signaling DB<br>
2662, copy protection handler 2663, and MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656. For<br>
reference, an embedded secure processor may be used instead of the smart card<br>
interface 2661.<br>
2672, video decoder 2673, and data decoder 2674.<br>
[189] The tuner 2611 of the digital broadcast receiver 2600 according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention receives a broadcast signal into which mobile service data and<br>
main service data are multiplexed. Of course, a module taking charge of this function<br>
may be named a reception unit.<br>
[190] The RS frame dectxler 2616 extracts transmission parameter channel (TPC) signaling<br>
information and fast infonnation channel (FlC) signaling information from a data<br>
group in the received mobile service data. Of course, a module taking charge of this<br>
function may be named an extractor. Also, a separate FIC decoder may be additionally<br>
provided to extract the FIC signaling information.<br>
[191] The MH transport signaling decoder 2641 acquires a program table describing virtual<br>
channel information and a service of an ensemble, which is a virtual channel group of<br>
the received mobile service data, using the extracted fast information channel signaling<br>
information. Of course, a module taking charge of this function may be named an<br>
acquirer.<br>
[ 192J On the other hand, the program table may correspond to a service map table (SMT)<br>
that is a table about configuration information of the mobile service data, and this SMT<br>
may be configured, for example, as in FIG. 17 or FIG. 27.<br>
[ 193] The transport handler 2650 and/or secure handler 2660 detects a conditional access<br>
descriptor distinctively defining respective levels at which the mobile service data was<br>
encrypted, using the acquired program table. Of course, a module taking charge of this<br>
function may be named a detector. The conditional access descriptor will be described<br>
later in detail with reference to FIG. 28.<br>
[ 194] Also, the transport handler 2650 and/or secure handler 2660 controls such that the<br>
encrypted mobile service data is decrypted correspondingly to an encrypted level<br>
thereof, using information of the detected conditional access (CA) descriptor. Of<br>
course, a module taking charge of this function may be named a controller.<br>
[195] Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present invention, in an MH digital<br>
broadcasting environment, only a bix)adcast receiver authorized to use a conditional<br>
<br>
<br>
access-applied service (fur example, an encrypted service, scrambled senice, or the<br>
like) can use that service. Also, according to one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
a definite signaling method for implementation of such a technology is defined.<br>
[196J On the other hand, the above-stated data group may include, for example, a plurality<br>
of known data sequences, and the transmission parameter channel signaling in-<br>
formation and the fast information channel signaling infoimation may be designed to<br>
be placed, for example, between a first known data sequence and a second known data<br>
sequence, among the known data sequences.<br>
(Iv/ ] I iiei'Cii&gt;rc, a Kiiovvii uata uotcctor or tiic Ciigital oroaocast receiver accoroiiig to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention may detect known data in the received broadcast<br>
signal, and an equalizer of the digital broadcast receiver according to this embodiment<br>
may channel-equalize mobile service data corresponding to the detected known data<br>
using the detected known data. For reference, the functions of the known data detector<br>
and equalizer were adequately described in the description of FIG. 1.<br>
[198] Moreover, according to this embodiment, the equalizer can improve equalization<br>
peifonnance by using a known data symbol sequence inputted from the known data<br>
detector.<br>
(199| Hereinafter, the operation of the broadcast receiver capable of processing the<br>
conditional access-applied service will be described in more detail with reference to<br>
FIG. 26.<br>
[200] The MH signaling DB 2620 is a database that stores MH signaling data received in<br>
non-fP or IP form and provides the stored data as needed.<br>
[2011 The MH transport signaling decoder 2641 processes non-IP MH signaling in-<br>
formation among MH signaling information, and the IP-based signaling decoder 2642<br>
processes IP-based MH signaling information among the MH signaling information.<br>
[202] The MH TP demux 2651 processes an MH transport packet (TP) extracted from an<br>
RS frame, which is an output of the RS frame decoder 2616, and the IP data handler<br>
2652 prcKesses an IP datagram to be delivered to an IP layer, in the MH TP. The UDP<br>
data handler 2653 processes a UDP datagram to be delivered to a UDP layer, in the IP<br>
datagram.<br>
[203] The file delivery handler 2654 processes a fde to be delivered to a file transfer<br>
protocol layer, in the UDP datagram. The stream delivery handler 2655 processes data<br>
to be delivered to an RTP layer (for example, a stream layer for real-time services), in<br>
the UDP datagram.<br>
[204] The application manager 2631 manages display of a service guide, and user input<br>
signals related to channel setup, etc. through the service guide. The application decoder<br>
2670 manages middle ware and decodei-s for output of services in an MH broadcasting<br>
system. The post processor/output module 2680 is an interface that post-processes<br>
<br>
<br>
decoded services and outputs voi'ious data to an external device.<br>
[2051 fn particular, modules taking charge of main functions in connection with the present<br>
invention may be the MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656, smart cai-d interface 2661,<br>
secure signaling DB 2662, copy protection handler 2663, etc., the functions of which<br>
will hereinafter be described in more detail.<br>
[206] The MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656 controls such that services to which a<br>
conditional access is applied, among MH services, are encrypted and decrypted cone-<br>
spondingly to the levels of respective layers.<br>

deciypt the conditional access-applied services, or high value services, among the MH<br>
services, and data required to securely process the corresponding services, and<br>
provides the stored data as needed.<br>
[2081 The smart card interface 2661 signifies a processor for processing data needed to be<br>
securely processed, and may be replaced by an embedded secure processor.<br>
[209] The copy protection handler 2663 functions to, for transmission of the high value<br>
services to an extemal interface, encrypt the high value services and process control<br>
data required for the encryption.<br>
[210] On the other hand, in order to implement a conditional access function, there is a<br>
need for various additional information such as information related to device and user<br>
authentication, infoimation about a reception authority level of the user, and a control<br>
word (may be referred to as, for example, a "key") which is used for encryption and<br>
decryption.<br>
12111 In other words, the conti-ol data is composed of an entitlement management message<br>
(EMM), entitlement control message (ECM), or the like, and the ECM includes a<br>
contiol word. This control data may be tiansmitted in an electronic service guide<br>
(ESG) or may be transmitted in other ways.<br>
[212J The digital broadcast receiver 2600 receiving the control data stores the control data<br>
in the MH signaling DB 2620 or the secure signaling DB 2662, which is a separate<br>
secure storage space, fn some cases, the digital broadcast receiver 2600 may receive<br>
and use the control data in real time.<br>
[213] Accordingly, in the case where an authorized digital broadcast receiver intends to use<br>
a conditional access-applied service, it may extract control data con-esponding to the<br>
service from the MH signaling DB 2620 or secure signaling DB 2662 or may extract<br>
the control data corresponding to the service in real time.<br>
[214] Also, the extracted control data is delivered to the MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656,<br>
which then removes the conditional access function of the coiresponding service using<br>
the delivered control data.<br>
[215] On the other hand, a packet level structure of an MH enciypted physical layer will<br>
<br>
<br>
hereinafter be described briefly with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
[216] fn the case where the conditional access is applied, an enciypted MH service, a<br>
control word required to decrypt the encrypted MH service, and other control data<br>
required for the conditional access are transmitted to a digital broadcast receiver side<br>
through an MH payload area shown in FIG. 2. That is, the conditional access-applied<br>
MH service is transmitted through the MH payload area after being encrypted, and the<br>
control data for setting and release of the conditional access function is also<br>
transmitted through the MH payload ai'ea.<br>

[2181 FIG. 27 shows another embodiment of a bit stream syntax of a service map table<br>
(referred to hereinafter as an "SMT") according to one embcxliment of the present<br>
invention, and FIG. 28 shows the syntax of a conditional access descriptor according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, with reference to FIGs. 27 and<br>
28 (and FIG. 17 a.s a subsidiary), an illustrative description will be given of a table and<br>
descriptor required to implement the conditional access function.<br>
[2I9| According to one embodiment of the present invention, an SMT (for example, shown<br>
in FIG. 17 or 27) indicative of the structures of MH services is transmitted. The SMT<br>
defines various information required in a piTxress of processing MH services carried<br>
through an RS frame. For example, the MH transport signaling decoder 2641 in FIG.<br>
26 may process the SMT. TTiis SMT is designable to notify information about<br>
conditional access-applied services, among MH services carried through the cor-<br>
responding RS frame. In particular, the SMT delivers control data required for<br>
processing of the conditional access function to a digital broadcast receiver side<br>
through the conditional access descriptor illustrated in FIG. 28. Of course, the control<br>
data may be transmitted to the digital broadcast receiver side thixjugh an ESG.<br>
[220J The S.MT of FIG. 27 can be understood with reference to the SMT of FIG. 17, and a<br>
supplementary description will hereinafter be given centering around some other<br>
fields.<br>
[221 ] In FIG. 27, a "service__provider_id" field indicates information identifying a seiTice<br>
provider, a "number_of_ensemble" field indicates the number of ensembles carried<br>
through this table, a "physical_freq_idx" field indicates the index of a physical frequen<br>
cy at which a specific ensemble is transmitted, an "en.semble_id" field indicates in-<br>
formation identifying at lea.st one ensemble, a "number_of_service" field indicates the<br>
number of services belonging to a specific ensemble, and a<br>
"number_of_target_IP_address" field indicates the number of target IP addresses<br>
belonging to a specific service. The remaining fields shown in FIG. 27 will be readily<br>
<br>
<br>
understood thruugh the field description of FIG. 17.<br>
[2221 Also, infonnation required to access a conditional access-applied service can be par-<br>
ticularly included in the descriptor of FIG. 28, which may be named a conditional<br>
access descriptor for convenience. It should be noted here that this name is nothing but<br>
one example. Also, for the convenience of description, the term "MH CA descriptor"<br>
may replace the conditional access descriptor.<br>
[223] The conditional access descriptor shown in FIG. 28 includes information identifying<br>
each level at which mobile service data v.'as encrypted, and information about control<br>
data which is used foi" uccryption of tlic encrypted iiiobilc service data.<br>
(224) In more detail, as shown in FIG. 28, a "descriptor_tag" Field indicates that this<br>
descriptor is an Ml I CA descriptor, a "descriptor_length" field indicates a length<br>
(expressed by, for example, bytes) from this field to a last Held of this descriptor, a<br>
"CA _System_lD" field indicates the type of a CA system associated with an ECM or<br>
EMM, an "ECM_EMM_tlag" field indicates whether the current MH_CA_ Descriptor<br>
is a descriptor of the ECM or a descriptor of the EMM. For example, the<br>
"ECM„EMM_flag" field signifies that the MH_CA_Descriptor is the descriptor of the<br>
ECM when the value thereof is '0', and that the MH_CA_Descriptor is the descriptor<br>
of the EMM when the value thereof is T. Of course, these numerical values are<br>
nothing but examples.<br>
[225] An "encrypt_level_tlag" field corresponds to information identifying each level at<br>
which mobile service data was encrypted or the conditional access was applied. For<br>
example, this field indicates "No Encryption" when it has a value '000', "IP Level<br>
Encryption" when '001', "RTP(Stream) Level Encryption" when '010', "Raw Level<br>
Encryption" when '011', and "reserved" when 'others'.<br>
[226] An "IF_flag" field indicates whether infomiation of a "destination_IP_address" field<br>
is present in the current MH_CA_Descriptor. For example, when the "IP_flag" field<br>
has a value '0', it indicates that infonnation of an "IP_version_fiag" field and the in-<br>
formation of the "destination_IP_address" field ai^e not present. In this case, the ECM<br>
or EMM is transmitted to a digital broadcast receiver side using the same IP address as<br>
"destination_IP_address" of the corresponding service and a port number different<br>
from "destinatJon_port_niimber" of the coiresponding service.<br>
]2271 In contrast, when the "IP_flag" field has a value ' 1', it indicates that the information<br>
of the "IP_version_flag" field and the information of the "destination_IP_address"<br>
field are present.<br>
[228] The "IP_version_flag" field indicates the version of the "destination._.IP_address".<br>
For example, the "IP_version_flag" field indicates that an IPv4 address has been used<br>
when the value thereof is '0', and that an IPv6 address has been used when the value<br>
thereof is '1'.<br>
<br>
<br>
[229| The "de.stination_IP_addie.ss" field indicates a destination IP address of an IP<br>
datagram in which the ECM or EMM is canied. A "destination._port_number" field<br>
indicates a destination port number of a UDP datagram in which the ECM or EMM is<br>
earned, and a "private_data_byte" field indicates data individually defined by a<br>
conditional access system (CAS).<br>
[230] The conditional access descriptor MH_CA_Descriptor defined in this manner may<br>
coirespond to a descriptor in the SMT shown in FIG. 17 or 27. For detailed example,<br>
the conditional access descriptor may be defined as any one of a component level<br>
descriptor, vinLial cliannel level ucscriptcr or criscmblc level descriptor of the SMT<br>
shown in FIG. 17 or as any one of a service provider descriptor, ensemble de.scriptor,<br>
service descriptor or tai"get IP address descriptor of the SMT shown in FIG. 27.<br>
[231 ] In the case where the conditional access descriptor is defined as the service provider<br>
descriptor of the SMT, the conditional access function operates with respect to all data<br>
corresponding to a specific service provider. On the other hand, in the case where the<br>
conditional access descriptor is defined as the ensemble descriptor of the SMT, the<br>
conditional access function operates with respect to all data con-esponding to a specific<br>
ensemble.<br>
[232] Also, in the case where the conditional access descriptor is defined as the service<br>
descriptor of the SMT, the conditional access function operates with respect to all data<br>
corresponding to a specific seiTice. Of course, this service may correspond to a virtual<br>
channel. Al.so, in the case where the conditional access descriptor is defined as the<br>
target IP address descriptor of the SMT, the conditional access function operates with<br>
respect to all data con-esponding to a specific target IP address.<br>
[233] FIG. 29 shows the structure of an RS frame according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention, and FIG. 30 shows an MH TP format according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Hereinafter, with reference to FIGs. 29 and 30, a description<br>
will be given of a packet level structure of an MH encrypted transport layer according<br>
to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[234J For reference, FIGs. 3 and 29 show RS frame structui^s, in which FIG. 3 shows an<br>
example of the stnicture of an RS frame including no conditional access-applied data<br>
and FIG. 29 shows an example of the stiiictiire of an RS frame including conditional<br>
access-applied data.<br>
[235] FIG. 29 shows the format of an RS frame that carries data coiresponding to an MH<br>
ensemble conesponding to each MH frame, which may be an output of an MH<br>
physical layer subsystem. As shown in FIG. 29, one RS frame can carry a plurality of<br>
MH .services, each of which includes a plurality of IP datagrams. Also, the RS frame is<br>
composed of a two dimensional byte airay of 187*N bytes, and each row of the RS<br>
frame constitutes an MH transpoil packet in view of an MH transport layer.<br>
<br>
<br>
[236| On the other hand, one MH TP has a format including an MH TP header ol"2 bytes<br>
and an MM TP payload of (N-2) bytes, which is ilhistrated in I'lG. 30. When stuffing<br>
bytes arc k bytes long, the MH TP header may be (N-2-k) bytes long.<br>
[237 j In FIG. 30, a "type indicator" field indicates the data type of payload data. The "type<br>
indicator" field signifies that the MH 'I'P cames signaling data when the value thereof<br>
is '000', and that the MH TP cairies an IP datagram when the value thereof is '001'.<br>
[238] An "error indicator" field indicates whether there is an enor detected in this MH TP,<br>
a "stuff indicator" field indicates whether there are stuffing bytes included in this MH<br>
TP. a '"pointer field" field indicates a start point <if a new packet in the payload of this></if>
MH TP, and a "stuffing bytes" field may become the start of the payload as needed<br>
(when there is stuffing of k bytes in the MH TP).<br>
[2.391 TTCi. 31 shows the structure of data encrypted at an IP level, according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 32 shows the structure of data encrypted at<br>
an RTF level, according to one embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 33<br>
shows the stioicture of data encrypted at a raw level, according to one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Hereinafter, with reference to FIGs. 31 to 33, a description will<br>
be given of processes of peiforming encryption and deciyption at the respective levels.<br>
|240j Data in an IP datagram, such as video, audio, timed text, etc., is transmitted through a<br>
layer for a real-time application, such as Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). For<br>
example, the video, audio and timed text data are delivered to an MH TP layer through<br>
the stream delivery handler 2655, UDP data handler 2653 and IP data handler 2652<br>
shown in FIG. 26.<br>
1241] FIG. 31 illustrates a method of packetizing real-time application data into an MH TP<br>
after applying a conditional access to the data (for example, encrypting the data) at the<br>
IP level.<br>
[242] First, with reference to FIG. 31, etc., a description will given of a process of<br>
encrypting mobile service data at the IF level by a digital broadcast transmitter or the<br>
like.<br>
[243] Real-time application data of an MH .service delivered through an RTP layer is<br>
packetized into an MH TP via a UDP layer and IP layer. At this time, in the case where<br>
the conditional access is applied to the MH seivice at the IP level, an IF datagram,<br>
which is an output of the IP layer, is first encrypted at an MH encrypt/deciypt layer<br>
before being packetized into an MH TP. The IP datagram encrypted in this manner is<br>
packetized into an MH TP at the MH TP layer and then transmitted to a physical layer.<br>
[244] Next, with reference to FIG. 31, etc., a description will given of a process of<br>
decrypting mobile service data encrypted at the IP level by a digital broadcast receiver<br>
or the like,<br>
[245] The digital broadcast receiver detennines whether the conditional access was applied<br>
<br>
<br>
to a given MH service, using tiie conditional access descriptor (see FKi. 28) included<br>
in the SMT (see FIG. 17 or 27). In particular, in the case where the<br>
"enciyptJeveLtlag" value is '001', the digital broadcast receiver peiforms deci-yption<br>
at the IP level. For the decryption at the IP level by the digital broadcast receiver, the<br>
MH TP demux 2651 extracts the given MH service and control data (for example, an<br>
ECM, EMM, or the like) from an RS frame, and the MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656<br>
decrypts the enciypted MH service using the control data processed by the secure<br>
handier 2660. Then, the IP data handler 2652 receives the dcciypted MH service, and<br>
ihe uiher iiuidules of the digital broadcast icceivcr coiitrol SLicii that the Mil .service is<br>
noiTnally (jutputted. Of course, the encryption process may be performed in the reverse<br>
order of the above-stated decryption process.<br>
[246] FIG. 32 illustrates a method of packetizing real-time application data into an Mil TP<br>
after applying a conditional access to the data (for example, encrypting the data) at the<br>
RTP (stream) level.<br>
[247J First, with reference to FIG. 32, etc., a description will given of a process of<br>
enciypting mobile service data at the RTP level by a digital broadcast transmitter or the<br>
like.<br>
1248] In the case where the conditional access is applied to real-time application data of an<br>
MH service at the RTP (stream) level, RTP (stream) data, which is an output of the<br>
RTP layer, is encrypted at the MH encrypt/decrypt layer. The encrypted data is<br>
packetized into an MH TP at the MH TP layer via the UDP layer and IP layer and then<br>
transmitted to the physical layer.<br>
12491 Of course, in the case where the conditional access is not applied, the RTP (stream)<br>
data, which is the output of the RTP layer, bypasses the MFI encrypt/decrypt layer. The<br>
RTP data, not encrypted, is packetized into an MH TP at the MH TP layer via the UDP<br>
layer and IP layer and then ti-ansmitted to the physical layer.<br>
[250] Next, with reference to FIG. 32, etc., a description will given of a process of<br>
decrypting mobile service data encrypted at the RTP level by a digital broadcast<br>
receiver or the like.<br>
[251J The digital broadcast receiver determines whether the conditional access was applied<br>
to a given MH service, using the conditional access descriptor (see FIG. 28) included<br>
in the SMT (see FIG. 17 or 27). In particular, in the case where the<br>
"enciypt_]evel_nag" value is '010', the digital broadcast receiver peiforms decryption<br>
at the RTP level. For the decryption at the RTP level by the digital broadcast receiver,<br>
the MH TP demux 2651 extracts the given MH seI^'ice and control data (for example,<br>
an ECM, EMM, or the like) from an RS frame, and the enciypted MH service is<br>
delivered to the MH encrypt/deciypt handler 2656 through the IP data handler 2652<br>
and UDP data handler 2653. The MH enciypt/decrypt handler 2656 decrypts the<br>
<br>
<br>
eiici-ypted MH service using the control data processed by the secure handler 2660.<br>
Then, the stream delivery handler 2655 receives the deciypted MH service, and the<br>
other modules of the digital broadcast receiver control such that the MH service is<br>
normally outputted. Of course, the encryption process may be performed in the reverse<br>
order of the above-stated decryption process.<br>
[2521 FIG. 33 illustrates a method of packetizing real-time application data into an MH TP<br>

encrypting mobile sen'ice data at the raw level by a digital broadcast transmitter or the<br>

[254] In the case where the conditional access is applied at the raw level, raw data of a real-<br>
time application of an MH service is encrypted at the MH enciypt/decrypt layer before<br>
being encapsulated at the RTF layer. The encrypted data is packetized into an MH TP<br>
at the MH TP layer via the RTP layer, UDP layer and IP layer and then transmitted to<br>
the physical layer.<br>
[255] Of course, in the case where the conditional access is not applied, the raw data,<br>
which is an output of an application layer, bypasses the MH encrypt/decrypt layer, and<br>
is packetized into an MH TP at the MH TP layer via the RTP layer, UDP layer and IP<br>
layer and then transmitted to the physical layer.<br>
[256] Next, with reference to FIG. 33, etc., a description will given of a process of<br>
decrypting mobile service data encrypted at the raw level by a digital broadcast<br>
receiver or the like.<br>
[257] The digital broadcast receiver determines whether the conditional access was applied<br>
to a given MH service, using the conditional access descriptor (see FIG. 28) included<br>
in the SMT (sec FIG. 17 or 27). Li particulai-, in the case where the<br>
"encrypt_level_flag" value is 'Oil', the digital broadcast receiver performs decryption<br>
at the raw level. For the decryption at the raw level by the digital broadcast receiver,<br>
the MH TP demux 2651 extracts the given MH service and control data (for example,<br>
an ECM, EMM, or the like) from an RS frame, and the encrypted MH service is<br>
delivered to the MH encrypt/decrypt handler 2656 through the IP data handler 2652,<br>
UDP data handler 2653 and stream deliveiy handler 2655. The MH encrypt/decrypt<br>
handler 2656 decrypts the encrypted MH service using the control data processed by<br>
the secure handler 2660. Then, the application decoder 2670 receives the decrypted<br>
MH service, and the other modules of the digital broadcast receiver control such that<br>
the MH service is normally outputted. Of course, the encryption process may be<br>
performed in the reverse order of the above-stated decryption process.<br>

1259) For example, ,^dvanced Encryption Standard (AES)-Coun'reR (CTR)-128 may be<br>
used as an encryption/decryption algorithm which is applied to an MH service for the<br>
conditional access thereof. In this case, enciyption may be performed at the IP level,<br>
RTF level and raw level, as shown in FIG. 34, and deciyption may be reversely<br>
performed at the IP level, RTP level and raw level, a.s shown in FIG. 35.<br>
[260] Notably, in the case of using the AES-CTR-128 algorithm shown as in FIGs. 34 and<br>
35, an initial counter value is required, and the present invention nevk'ly defines the<br>
counter value as in FIG. 36.<br>
12611 In FIG. 36, a "type indicator" field indicates the type of an encrypted stream, a<br>
"system time" field indicates a system time of a superframe, and a "destination port<br>
number" field indicates a destination port number of an encrypted stream. The use of<br>
the counter value defined in this manner makes it possible to uniquely define a counter<br>
value of each data block composed of 16 bytes. It is also possible to increase<br>
efficiency.<br>
[262J Also, the "type indicator" field shown in FIG. 36 may be designed to correspond to<br>
the "type indicator" field of the MH TP shown in FIG. 30. In the case of being<br>
designed like this, the "type indicatoi^' field in FIG. 36 signifies that an MH TP of an<br>
encrypted stream cairies signaling data when the value thereof is '000', and that an<br>
MH TP of an encrypted stream carries an IP datagram when the value thereof is '001'.<br>
[263] Therefore, according to one embcxliment of the present invention, as a counter value<br>
to be used in an encryption/decryption algorithm (for example, the AES-CTR-128<br>
algorithm or the like), different counter values can be set according to an MH TP<br>
canying signaling data and an MH TP carrying an IP datagram, paiticularly by using<br>
the type indicator of each MH TP. Further, there is an advantage that the encryption/<br>
decryption algorithm is designable to operate depending on MH TPs having such<br>
different counter values.<br>
[264] On the other hand, data to be encrypted and decrypted according to one embodiment<br>
of the present invention is partitioned into 128-bit blocks and then encrypted and<br>
decrypted. As a result, the last data block may not be up to 128 bits. For preparation for<br>
<br>
<br>
Ihis case, a design may be made to XOR an oiilput value From an AES encryption<br>
block and the value of a residue data block beginning with most significant bits, as<br>
shown in FTC 37.<br>
[2651 FIG. 38 is a detailed view of an SMT including a conditional access descriptor<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 39 sht)Ws the structure<br>
of an RS frame including an MH service to which a conditional access is applied,<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, in conjunction with<br>
FIGs. 38 and 39, an illustrative description will be given of a process of processing a<br>
coiiuiLi<. ucccss-appiicd soi iii a nigouc ijigital broagcasting ciiviroiiiiicrit.></.>
12661 Each MH_CA_Descriptor shown in FIG. 38 indicates a level at which the<br>
conditional access is applied, control data required in a decryption process, and so<br>
forth. The MII_CA_Descriptor_l provides information about a conditional access-<br>
applied ECM with respect to only a service whose target TP address is 200.200.200.5,<br>
among services whose ensemble ID is 1 and major channel number and minor channel<br>
number are 30-5.<br>
[267] The MH_CA_Desciiptor_2 provides infc^rmation about a conditional access-applied<br>
ECM with respect to all seiTices whose ensemble ID is 1 and major channel number<br>
and minor channel number are 30-6. That is, the MH_CA_Descriptor_2 provides the<br>
information about the conditional access-applied ECM with respect to services whose<br>
target IP addresses are 200.200.200.6 and 200.200.200.7.<br>
[268] On the other hand, as stated previously, a digital broadcast receiver according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention can determine whether the conditional access-<br>
applied service was encrypted at which one of the raw level, RTP level and IP level, by<br>
using "encrypt_level_flag" of the MH_C A_Descriptor. At this time, the digital<br>
broadcast receiver needs control data for authorization of access to conditional access-<br>
applied services, and so forth. That is, the digital broadcast receiver can acquire EMM<br>
information for authorization of reception of all services whose ensemble ID is '1',<br>
using the fact that the value of ECM_EMM_tlag of the MH„CA_Descriptor_3 is ' 1'.<br>
[269J FIG. 39 shows the structure of an RS frame including seiTices in which the ensemble<br>
ID is '1' and the conditional access is applied, in the SMT shown in FIG. 38.<br>
[270] In the case where a service 2 is selected in the RS frame structure of FIG. 39, a<br>
digital broadcast receiver according to one embodiment of the present invention can<br>
confirm that MH_CA_Descriptor associated with the service 2 is present in the SMT<br>
of FIG. 38. That is, the digital broadcast receiver can confimi that the conditional<br>
access was applied to the service 2.<br>
[271 ] At this time, the digital broadcast receiver can confiim from the<br>
MH_CA_Descriptor_2 associated with the service 2 that an ECM (including a control<br>
word, etc.) requii-ed for removal of the conditional access function of the service 2 is<br>
<br>
<br>
transmitted thi\)iigh a destination IP address '200.200.200.9' and a destination port<br>
number '1000'. Also, the digital broadcast receiver can confinn that an E.MM. among<br>
control data required for authorization of access to the enciypted service 2, is<br>
transmitted through a destination IP address '200.200.200.10' and a destination port<br>
number '1000'. Therefore, using the confiixncd ECM, EMM, etc., the digital broadcast<br>
receiver can remove the conditional access function of the encrypted sewice 2.<br>
[272] FIG. 40 is a flowchart illustrating a control method of a digital broadcast receiver<br>
acc(irding to one embodiment of the present invention. With reference to FIG. 40, a<br>
brief description v,ill hereinafter be given of the control method of the digital broadcast<br>
receiver according to one embtxliment of the present invention. For reference, FIGs. 40<br>
and 45 relate to a method invention, which can be interpreted with the description of<br>
the above stated object invention supplementarily applied thereto.<br>
[2731 The digital broadcast receiver according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
decodes an RS frame (S4000). The digital broadcast receiver extracts an SMT a.s a<br>
result of the decoding (84001) and pai^se.s the extracted SMT to check information<br>
required for removal of a conditional access function (S4002).<br>
1274) ITie digital broadcast receiver extracts MH TPs according to the SMT to extract<br>
control data, etc. (S4003). The digital broadcast receiver parses an MH TP header<br>
(S4004) to determine the value of a "Type_Indicator" field (S4005). When it is<br>
determined at step S4005 that the field value is '000', the digital broadcast receiver<br>
processes signaling data (S4017). When it is determined at step S4005 that the field<br>
value is '001', the digital broadcast receiver determines the value of an<br>
'encrypt__level_flag' field of a conditional access descriptor (corresponding to<br>
MH__CA.. Descriptor shown in FIG. 28) of the SMT (S4006).<br>
[2751 When it is determined at step S4006 that the value of the 'encryptJeveLflag' field is<br>
"00r, the digital broadcast receiver decrypts encrypted mobile service data at an IP<br>
level (S4007). That is, the digital broadcast receiver decrypts an IP datagram.<br>
[276] In the case where it is determined at step S4006 that the value of the<br>
'encrypt_level_flag' field is not '001', the digital broadcast receiver proces.ses an IP<br>
datagram (S4008) and processes a UDP datagram (S4009). Also, the digital broadcast<br>
receiver determines whether data transmitted from a digital broadcast transmitter or the<br>
like is a file or stream (S4010). When it is determined at step 4010 that the transmitted<br>
data is the stream, the digital broadcast receiver determines the value of the<br>
'encrypt_level_flag' field (S40I2). In contrast, when it is determined at step 4010 that<br>
the transmitted data is the file, the digital broadcast receiver processes the file (S4011).<br>
[277J In the case where it is determined at step S4012 that the value of the<br>
'encrypt_level_flag' field is '010', the digital broadcast receiver decrypts encrypted<br>
mobile service data at an RTP level (S40I3). That is, the digital broadcast receiver<br>
<br>
<br>
deciypts stream data.<br>
[278] In the case where it is determined at step S40I2 that the value of the<br>
¦encrypt_level_flag' field is not '010', the digital broadcast receiver processes the<br>
stream (S4014) and detennines the value of the 'encrypt_level_flag' field (S4016).<br>
When it is determined at step S4016 that the value of the 'encrypt_level_flag' field is<br>
'Oir, the digital broadcast receiver deci-ypts encrypted mobile service data at a raw<br>
level (S4015). That is, the digital broadcast receiver deci-ypts raw data.<br>
[279] hi contrast, when it is dctennincd at step .S4016 that the value of the<br>
an application is prcKesscd suitably to a corresponding format (S4018). This forniat<br>
may be, for example, a file, stream, signaling data, or the like.<br>
[280j The present method may be designed such that the step S4010 of detenrsining<br>
whether the transmitted data is the file or stream or the step S4011 is deleted and the<br>
step S4012 is performed immediately subsequently to the step S4009.<br>
[281] FIG. 41 is a table defining copy control infomiation (CCI) according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, FIG. 42 illustrates an encryption mode indicator<br>
(EMI) shown in FIG. 41, FIG. 43 illustrates an analog protection system (APS) shown<br>
in FIG. 41, and FIG. 44 illustrates a constrained image trigger (CIT) shown in FIG. 41.<br>
Hereinafter, with reference to FIGs. 41 to 44, a description will be given of a method<br>
capable of securely setting copy protection when a conditional access-applied MH<br>
service is transmitted to an external interface, according to one embodiment of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[2821 As stated previously, a conditional access-applied MH service is transmitted to<br>
digital broadcast receivers, and only an authorized user or digital broadcast receiver<br>
can use the MH service. Notably, in order to prevent an illegal copy from occurring<br>
when the MH service is transmitted through an external interface, one emb(xliment of<br>
the present invention defines new signaling data.<br>
[28.?] The signaling data for the illegal copy prevention may be illustrated as in FIG. 41.<br>
For example, this signaling data may be copy control information (CCI) composed of 8<br>
bits.<br>
[284] On the other hand, an encryption mode indicator (EMI), among CCI fields shown in<br>
FIG. 41, may be configured as in FIG. 42. This EMI is information for copy control of<br>
digital data, which is used to control a copy authority of a digital data output.<br>
[285] Also, an analog protection system (APS), among the CCI fields shown in FIG. 41,<br>
may be configured as in FIG. 43. This APS is used to control a copy authority of an<br>
analog data output.<br>
[286] Also, a constrained image trigger (CIT), among the CCI fields shown in FIG. 41,<br>
may be configured as in FIG. 44. This CIT is used to control a copy authority of an<br>
<br>
<br>
image i)f a high definition analog component t)ulpiit.<br>
[287 j The CCl may be transmitted under the condition of being not encrypted, but a digital<br>
broadcast receiver has to confirm whether the transmitted CCI is legal data transmitted<br>
from a service provider. Therefore, according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the CCI may be transmitted in an ECM or a descriptor of an SMT or using a<br>
secure scheme such as public key infrastructure (PKl).<br>
(2881 For example, according to one embodiment of the present invention, an EMI defining<br>
a copy authority of a digital data output, an APS defining a copy authority of an analog<br>
data output, and a CIT defining a copy authority of a high definition analog component<br>
data output may be additionally defined in the conditional access descriptor shown in<br>
FIG. 28.<br>
[289J In this case, when a service with CCI is outputted to a variety of estemul interfaces<br>
such as IEFE-1394, USB, DVI, HDMI and component (RGB, YPbPr), the copy<br>
protection handler 2663 can output a stream or service with a copy authority set therein<br>
to the external interfaces according to the type of data using the CCI (for example,<br>
defined as a conditional access descriptor). For reference, the copy protection handler<br>
2663 may be named a transmission unit.<br>
[290] Also, the CCI may be stored in the secure signaling DB 2662 or other storages, and a<br>
digital broadcast receiver according to one embodiment of the present invention may<br>
use the stored CCI to output a service tn an external interface.<br>
[291J FIG. 45 is a flowchart illustrating a control method of a digital broadcast receiver and<br>
digital broadcast transmitter according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
With reference to FIG. 45, a detailed description will hereinafter be given of the<br>
control method of the digital broadcast receiver and digital broadcast transmitter<br>
according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[292] The digital broadcast transmitter according to one embodiment of the present<br>
invention generates a broadcast signal including a conditional access descriptor<br>
indicating whether mobile service data was encrypted (S4501) and transmits the<br>
generated broadcast signal including the conditional access descriptor to a digital<br>
broadcast receiver (S4502).<br>
[293] Here, the conditional access descriptor includes information identifying each level at<br>
which the mobile service data was encrypted, and information about control data<br>
which is u.sed for decryption of the encrypted mobile service data. Also, the<br>
conditional access descriptor may be configured as in FIG. 28, and may be referred to<br>
as MH_CA_Descriptor.<br>
[294] The digital broadcast receiver according to one embodiment of the present invention<br>
receives a broadcast signal into which mobile service data and main service data are<br>
multiplexed (S4503) and extracts TPC/FIC signaling infomiation from a data group in<br>
<br>
<br>
the received mobile service data (S4504).<br>
1295] Also, the digital broadcast receiver acquires a program table describing virtual<br>
channel infoiTnation and a service of an ensemble, which is a virtual channel group of<br>
the received mobile service data, using the extracted FFC signaling information<br>
(S4505J. Then, the digital broadcast receiver detects a conditional access descriptor<br>
indicating whether the mobile service data was encrypted, using the acquired pn)gram<br>
table (S45()6). For detailed example, the conditional access descriptor may be a<br>
descriptor distinctively defining respective levels at which the mobile sen-ice data was<br>
CiiCi*V piCu.<br>
(2961 Then, the digital broadcast receiver controls such that the encrypted mobile service<br>
data is decrypted, using information of the detected conditional access descriptor<br>
(S4507). For detailed example, at step S4507, the digital broadcast receiver may<br>
control such that the enciypted mobile service data is decrypted coirespondingly to an<br>
encrypted level thereof.<br>
L297] For reference, the program table may con-espond to the SMT shown in FIG. 17 or 27,<br>
and the conditional access descriptor may correspond to the MH_CA_Descriptor<br>
shown in FIG. 28.<br>
[2981 In this regard, the step S4507 may further include determining a level at which the<br>
mobile service data was enci^pted, using, for example, the MH_CA_Descriptor of the<br>
SMT, and decrypting the enciypted mobile service data at a level corresponding to the<br>
determination result using the infomiation about the control data.<br>
[299] As described above, according to one embodiment of the present invention, it is<br>
possible to readily decrypt mobile service data encrypted, for example, at a raw level,<br>
RTF level and IP level iirespective of the positions of the levels in a mobile digital<br>
broadcasting environment.<br>
[300] Further, according to one embodiment of the present invention, mobile service data<br>
requiring no conditional access is designed to bypass an MH encrypt/decrypt layer,<br>
thereby enabling compatibility with existing systems.<br>
[301 ] In addition, according to one embodiment of the present invention, an illegal copy<br>
can be prevented even when mobile service data is outputted to an external interface.<br>
[302] The present method invention can be implemented in the form of program commands<br>
executable by a variety of computer means, and recorded on a computer-readable<br>
recording medium. The computer-readable recording medium can include program<br>
commands, data tiles, data structures, etc. individually or in combination. The program<br>
commands recorded on the medium may be ones specially designed and configured for<br>
the present invention or ones known and available to those skilled in computer<br>
software. Examples of the computer-readable recording medium include magnetic<br>
media such as a hard disk, a floppy disk and a magnetic tape, optical media such as a<br>
<br>
compact disc read only memoi-y (CD-ROM) and a digital versatile disc (DVD),<br>
maBneto-optical media such as a floptical disk, and hardware devices specially<br>
configured to store and execute program commands, such as a ROM, a random access<br>
memory (RAM) and a flash memoiy. Examples of the program commands include<br>
high-level language codes that can be executed by a computer using an interpreter, etc.,<br>
as well as machine language codes such as those produced by a compiler. The above-<br>
stated hardware devices can be configured to operate as one or more software modules<br>
to perform the operation of the present invention, and vice versa.<br>

embcxJiments and drawings, the present invention is not limited therctt). 'fTiosc skilled<br>
