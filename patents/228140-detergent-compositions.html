The detergent compositions can take a variety of physical forms including powder, granular, tablet and liquid forms. Examples thereof are conventional powder heavy-duty detergents, compact and supercompact heavy-duty detergents and tablets, like heavy-duty detergent ablets. One important physical form is the so-called concentrated granular form adapted to be added to a washing machine.<br>
Of importance are also the so-called compact (or supercompact) detergents. In the field of detergent manufacture, a trend has developed recently towards the production of compact<br><br>
detergents, which contain increased amounts of active substance. In order to minimize energy expenditure during the washing process, the compact detergents are required to operate efficiently at temperatures as low as 40°C, or even at room temperatures, e.g. at 25°C. Such detergents usually contain only low amounts of fillers or processing aids, like sodium sulfate or sodium chloride. The amount of such fillers is usually 0-10 wt-%, preferably 0-5 wt-%, especially 0-1 wt-%, based on the total weight of the detergent composition. Such detergent compositions usually have a bulk density of 650-1000 g/l, preferably 700-1000 g/l and especially 750-1000 g/l.<br>
The detergent compositions can also be present in the form of tablets. Relevant characteristics of tablets are ease of dispensing and convenience in handling. Tablets are the most compact delivery of solid detergents and have a bulk density of, for example, 0.9 to 1.3 kg/litre. To enable fast disintegration laundry detergent tablets generally contain special disintegrants:<br>
-	Effervescents such as carbonate/hydrogencarbonate/citric acid;<br>
-	swelling agents like cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, cross-linked poly(N-vinylpyrrollidone);<br>
-	quickly dissolving materials such as Na (K) acetate, or Na (K) citrate;<br>
-	rapidly dissolving water-soluble rigid coating such as dicarboxy acids.<br>
The tablets can also contain combinations of any of the above disintegrants.<br>
The detergent composition may also be formulated as an aqueous liquid comprising 5-50 wt-%, preferably 10-35 wt-% or as a non-aqueous liquid detergent, containing not more than 5 wt-%, preferably 0-1 wt-% of water, based on the total weight of the detergent composition. Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions can contain other solvents as carriers. Low molecular weight primary or secondary alcohols exemplified by methanol, ethanol, propanol, and isopropanol are suitable. Monohydric alcohols are preferred for solubilizing surfactant, but polyols such as those containing from 2 to about 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to about 6 hydroxy groups (e.g., 1,3-propanediol, ethylene glycol, glycerine, and    1 ,2-propanediol) can also be used. The compositions may contajn from 5 to 90 wt-%, typically 10 to 50 wt-% of such carriers, based on the total weight of the detergent composition. The detergent compositions can also be present as the so-called "unit liquid dose" form.<br><br>

The compounds have the advantage that they are also effective in the presence of active chlorine donors, such as, for example, hypochlorite and can be used without substantial loss of the effects in washing baths with non-ionic washing agents, for example alkylphenol polyglycol ethers. Also in the presence of perborate or peraC1ds and activators, for example tetraacetylglycoluril or ethylenediamine-tetraacetic aC1d are the mixtures of these compounds stable both in pulverulent washing agent and in washing baths. In addition, they impart a brilliant appearance in daylight.<br>

Over a period of 30 minutes 185ml of a solution of 4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic aC1d (as disodium salt) in water (concentration of 10Og/l) are added dropwise, the temperature being between -8 und +5°C. The pH is maintained at a value between 4.5 and 5 by addition of an aqueous sodium carbonate solution. A yellowish<br><br>
suspension is obtained. Then, by use of a dropping funnel, 27.2g of ethanolamine (99%) are added. The pH increases to a value of 10 and then drops to a lower value, whereby the temperature increases to 10 to 15°C. Then the reaction mixture is warmed to a temperature of 45°C and held at this temperature for 20 minutes. During heating to 98°C within 30 minutes a mixture of methylethylketone and water is distilled off; the pH is maintained at a value between 8.5 and 9 by addition of an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After no further addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is necessary in order to maintain the pH at a constant value the reaction mixture is cooled to 50°C.<br>
A yellowish crystalline preC1pitate can be filtered off. After drying 29g of a yellowish product of the compound of formula (103) are obtained.<br>
Preparation Example 12:<br><br>
In a 1 litre pressure vessel 0.037 mole of N,N'-bis-(4-morpholino-6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl)-4,4'-diaminostilbene-2,2,-disulfonic aC1d (as disodium salt) are suspended in 500ml of water. 18g of an aqueous solution of methylamine (40%) are added and the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature of 100 to 105°C and stirred for 4.5 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C and the preC1pitate is filtered off, washed with 100ml of a 10% aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried in vacuum at 70°C. In this way there are obtained 21.2g of a yellowish powder of the compound of formula (104) are obtained.<br>

Preparation Example 16:<br><br><br>
In a 1 liter flask 0.05 mole of N.N'-bis(-morpholino-6-chloro-I,3,5-triazine--y)-4,4'-diaminostilbene-2.2-disulfonic aC1d (as disodium salt) are suspended in 600ml of water and heated to a temperature of 60°C. 6.4g of ethanolamine are added and the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature of 98°C. The pH is maintained at a value between 8.5 and 9 by addition of a 4-molar aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°C and 10% by volume of sodium chloride are added.
